relationship_advice,fp63vzn,t1_fp5x919,1588345587.0,Thank you for vocalizing this because I feel like a lot of people really like to jump the gun on here
UCI,fp5xma9,t3_gbao6z,1588342083.0,"Omg same, I was literally addressing a non-existent proctor throughout my whole test. Though the plus side is that it took away a lot of my test anxiety because I could talk aloud, curse whenever, and deliberate with myself out loud"

INTP,fo5afmj,t1_fo4mthq,1587521039.0,"Ik righttt, like if u can copy emotions u can copy/steal someoneâ€™s good handwriting. Thatâ€™s what I do and expected other INTPs to do."

Wintp,fnk9fqb,t1_fnjiejg,1587019093.0,"The amount of time and energy it takes to revise each comment I make is one of the founding reasons why I don't comment. I feel like problems come out in my writing when my true mood isn't displayed so I revise like crazy to 1) show I'm literate, and 2) show that I always try to frame things nicely. Thanks for the props, my Writing professors aren't gratifying me enough."
Wintp,fnjcsyn,t1_fnj5vx0,1586996380.0,"Definitely a comma missing thanks ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
So I guess grammarly is only good for quelling the obvious errors and making me feel faux smart"
INTP,fngx1b5,t3_g1n0a9,1586948110.0,"Same with my Dad, now all of a sudden he took the test to find he's an ESFJ and now he's tryna type, my mom, too. Now I always feel super giddy with him (because he actually listens to me and understands that my vocabulary is precious) and I act like an Instigative ENTP when I'm with him.  

I now feel like I'm in the Daddy's Girl phase all over again (bc my dad is 'new' to me), ik it's not gonna last forever, but hey what does..."
INTP,fnavtgx,t3_g0n6yg,1586804707.0,"I socialize to gain headway in a imaginative competition that Iâ€™ve inserted all my friends into. Think School Flirting Game (girlsgogames). I see it, that each person has an appreciation meter set for each friend. So I just see to it that for the people I actually want in my circle I make sure to at least be in 1-3rd place in their hearts relative to the rest of the friends in that group, these then equate to points that determines the subconscious hierarchy in our group. 
The reason I do all this is to cut down on how hard I have to work to network. So that means Iâ€™m surrounding myself with peeps who are really good at socializing so that Iâ€™m always in the know from a distance. 
Ps when trying this method always occupy the #1 spot in the heart of the friend who is at the top of the hierarchy and donâ€™t try too hard to be precise with the ranking system you most likely can already analyze your group dynamics to a tee.
tldr: I make friendship a game in which my Ti gets very competitive so Iâ€™ll actually be interested in interacting with my friends."
INTP,fn2rqwf,t1_ff4jyca,1586600654.0,"Waitttttt, stoppppp Iâ€™m scared, now everybody know EXACTLY how to make me fall in love with them. Like a bitch really thought she was complex or sum.
U can make this clown fall for u in only 5 MEASLY steps"
INTP,fmzb1pj,t1_fmz3l3d,1586513559.0,And thatâ€™s on never opening my mouth and just pleasantly bouncing back emotions
INTP,fmvkhbl,t3_fxe1ua,1586420262.0,"For me I have an ENFP friend that actually keeps me rambling, I honestly come out of the conversations scared b/c willing giving out more and more information about how I truly feel really isnâ€™t something I see myself doing (itâ€™s usually that Iâ€™ve interpreted that anything I say will be wasted/lost on the group Iâ€™m talking to in some form or another, so I end up just being a good brick wall to let your thoughts out on). I think Iâ€™ve been so used to prompting other people that when my ENFP friend prompts me to talk it makes me so happy (bc itâ€™s so rare) that she always wants me to get my feelings out (understand them) so we can dissect the latest gossip with objective minds"
