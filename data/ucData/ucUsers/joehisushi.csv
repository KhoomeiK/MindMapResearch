UCSD,fozsadn,t1_fozayyj,1588195984.0,Thank you! thank you so much! I bought a Muir one! I'm so happy!
UCSD,fow9n2l,t3_g74t2u,1588115587.0,"Yes I would. Wholeheartedly. While the school's focus on academics really impacted my overall wellness, the friends I made here supported me through any obstacles. I struggled feeling welcomed here, but found a resource center that helped me connect to others and find my culture on campus. The on campus jobs I have led me to people I would have never met. I'm so thankful for my coworkers and the students I help as a mentor. But also lmao don't get me wrong, there's a lot about UCSD as an administration I'm not happy about. I wouldn't know what type of college experience I would have had if I went to another college, but I'm 100% thankful to UCSD for the people I got to meet here and the experiences that made my time here memorable."

samsung,fj44ibs,t3_fb5gfw,1583000095.0,"Hi!! So my laptop isn't charging. It's the notebook np530e5m. I thought it was just the actual charger so I bought a new one. It worked just enough to open my laptop, sign in, and then it died. Everytime I take my charger out, the little plastic ring is all scratched up. I can't afford to go to a tech repair shop and finals are in a few weeks so I'm lowkey freaking out ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­."
