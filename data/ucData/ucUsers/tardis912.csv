UCSC,fp7oaw1,t1_fp6tzqf,1588374449.0,This prof sounds like not only a dick but just highly ignorant of how Canvas actually works. That he has the audacity to say people weren't following instructions when there was a technical error in Canvas is just ridiculous.
loseit,fp7nta2,t1_fp7n720,1588374174.0,"I spent months counting more regularly but in the past few weeks I've moved to eating a bit more intuitively as you say, but I think maybe counting macros more closely for a while could help as you seem to be suggesting here. I used to use cronometer a lot to look at both my macros/micros and maybe going back to that for a while could be a good idea just so I can get a good sense of my overall nutrition. More recently with calorie counting I've just been using more generic apps like myfitnesspal that give you some of that information too but I like the UI of cronometer more"
loseit,fp7ndzf,t1_fp7mohe,1588373934.0,"I've used multiple calculators for TDEE that indicate 2600. I do high intensity exercise 7+ hours a week in addition to walking 15000+ steps every day. I would assume someone moderately active would get 2400, but I am definitely *highly* active."
loseit,fp7mewg,t1_fp7lrqa,1588373391.0,I like the idea more because I don't think I could manage eating 2000 calories every day. It would feel like too much food. But I worry I'm not getting quite enough nutrition at this level given how active I am and that matters to me a lot too.
loseit,fp7m0sx,t1_fp7l8k4,1588373174.0,"I'm 5'5"" and 155. At 145 I would technically be in a normal BMI range though I would prefer to get down to about 130 ultimately."
loseit,fp7ltfj,t1_fp7lgxl,1588373061.0,That's a really smart way of approaching this! At 1600 I tend to feel pretty full so trying to force myself to eat more every day would be hard. Doing it just twice a week would be the perfect balance.

neuro,fa9ftst,t1_fa9ecdx,1575872051.0,When I stay over at my siblings houses they say I am the quietest sleeper they’ve ever slept next to. I sleep like a log and don’t make any noise.
