thebeachboys,fperof0,t3_gcws9g,1588553499.0,"The full box set has got pretty much everything except for the full ""psycodelic sounds"" session, the full ""Vega-Tables promo"" session and a handful of super obscure vocal stems that are still only available on bootlegs. Also there's no official stereo mix of the album since the set only has the mono version, but that's what fan mixes are for."
thebeachboys,fpcjmxo,t3_gab9sp,1588503018.0,"I posted one here a few months ago, it's still kind of a beta version though, with no title:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/thebeachboys/comments/e2udpc/my1stbonerwascamdiaz\_presents\_smile\_my\_stereo\_mix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebeachboys/comments/e2udpc/my1stbonerwascamdiaz_presents_smile_my_stereo_mix/). I highly recommend hearing ""Heroes and Villains"", since it was the most fun to make.

I'll update it soon for a complete release with metadata and sources and stuff. The working title is currently *SMiLE: Night Version*."

thebeachboys,fn1uqe0,t1_fmtomk2,1586570570.0,"I like how I Wanna Be Around/Workshop ends the album with some melancholy but also some relief, as if it's basically saying ""damn boys that was quite an album, well, back to real life I guess"". Now that I think of it I actually prefer it like this, since in my mix it ends with Surf's Up and just leaves a sad impression which the album isn't about.

Also yes that 3-song run of Fire/DYLW/Cabin Essence is so cool, it's like the 3 weirdest songs too."

thebeachboys,fn1qiz7,t3_fxbjcx,1586567783.0,"[My mix](https://bit.ly/2XdEFZh) goes like this:

1. Our Prayer
2. Gee / Brian Falls Into A Piano (with strange effects)
3. Heroes and Villains (a 9 minute version with too much going on to sum up here lmao, but it includes Barnyard, Great Shape, Da Da, Speeches, and most of the unused instrumental bits)
4. Do You Like Worms?
5. Holidays
6. Cabin Essence (with added skit featuring Tune X)

Side 2

1. Good Vibrations
2. The Elements Suite (Vega-Tables, Wind Chimes, Fire, Love To Say Dada; littered with psycodelic sounds)
3. Wonderful
4. Look
5. Child Is Father Of The Man
6. Surf's Up"

thebeachboys,fmr5aeb,t3_fwvsi9,1586314206.0,"I marathoned their discography a few years ago and honestly I got interested as early as the song ""Lonely Sea"". The next few commercial albums from like 63-64 were a major letdown in comparison, but I knew they'd eventually blow me away like that song, and surely enough it happened with ""California Girls"". I've been hooked ever since, and I got so addicted to SMiLE I made my own mix of it."
