UCSD,fotd6lg,t3_fi9kzn,1588050570.0,Hi I got into Warren as a Biology major as a Transfer student. This has probably been asked so many times but what’s the difference between colleges? Also I put UCSD in my FASFA but when I click on financial aid in the portal it says there no financial aid info for me? Has this happened to anyone?
UCI,fo34is1,t1_fo32zid,1587480404.0,I read here earlier some guy got rejected last year but got accepted through tag a couple of days after his rejection letter. I don’t know if I should wait a few days before appealing
UCI,fo31nh5,t3_g59xyc,1587478823.0,Yes me too! I got rejected even though I tagged UCI
UCI,fo31e42,t1_fo29niv,1587478677.0,"That happened to me too! I got rejected and I tagged UCI, I am biology major so idk if that has anything to do with it."
comiccon,ff6tx3s,t3_eryyr2,1579634802.0,Is it worth to just wait for the downtown sale? It’s my first time going and I’m undecided
