It's definitely important to use discernment in your anger, to which I think I've done. My PI is one of the professors who has earned the job-well-done title and I would never say she's slacking or doing a disservice to students. From my perspective, Davis as a whole has done a great job with the switch to online learning! All the undergrads in my lab have had good experiences so far. 

But in regards to the story with my partner, when you've got the deans and chancellor telling you ""we've got it bad too"" it feels like they don't care. Even if they are having a hard time, they have to be aware of their title and place of power. There is more to it than the speculation of how much they make that feeds the anger."
UCDavis,fosqx2a,t1_fos7t5t,1588036204.0,Exactly! It doesn't take much to find even deeper issues/hypocrisies with the statement.
UCDavis,fos28l1,t3_g97ap3,1588022647.0,"My partner works at a different university and the professors have done nothing to help. They sent out a letter than basically said ""as professors we're having a hard time too."" And I have a really hard time stomaching that sentiment when they're the ones making $100,000 versus the students who are paying upwards of $80k for a subpar education.

I am no longer a student at Davis, but I am staff. I'm super thankful that for the most part, Davis has done an excellent job in their response to the pandemic in regards to education."

To answer the question about how to prepare for intimacy, prepare your partner. Communicate with them what you're feeling and ask them to work with you to find what suits you right now. Being comfortable should be your priority, and comfort comes with familiarity. Make sure you both know what the boundaries are and communicate constantly. In the moment, let her know what you like and what you don't."
