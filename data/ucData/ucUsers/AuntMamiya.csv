berkeley,fpi1xc2,t1_fpi15ed,1588632055.0,"Excuse the mistake, I meant prison. People have been in prison since the 90’s for minor drug offenses if they had three strikes. The law may have changed now but it hasn’t conferred any of the benefits of that change to those still in prison, correct me if I’m wrong?"
berkeley,fpi0qgh,t1_fphz1p6,1588631395.0,"I’d like to be clear here: nobody wants crime. Where we differ is that I believe fundamentally that the way criminality is treated now in the US is wrong. Why are we the most wealthy nation in the world yet we lag behind all other developed nations in preventing crime? Why do we imprison more people than any other nation? Why do other capitalist nations have lower crime rates? It’s because of the way they treat criminals. 

My mentor has worked throughout South America for 20 years and has seen the brutality. He’s on my side. Crime occurs because people internalize the fear that instability creates. You can remedy that without being capitalist and without subjecting people to psychological torture in a prison. It’s about meeting people’s needs and helping them provide for their families. 

Why are the governments in these countries so unstable? Because the US started coups, sanctioned them, and has done everything it can to destabilize any efforts at socialist movements. 

Tough on crime mentality does nothing but perpetuate a system that incarcerates black and brown men so they can be exploited. It’s nonsense. You prevent crime by creating stable households! 

I’ve worked with families who have been the victims of crime. I know the experience. After looking at the issue and studying it and reading up on it through the books I’ve recommended I can say wholeheartedly Chesa’s move is the way forward. We need to abolish prisons."
berkeley,fphxh9u,t1_fphtz3u,1588629620.0,"I didn’t call people capitalists and bigots. The police are bigots, sure. The capitalist *system* creates environments where gang affiliation is more likely to occur because of instability. I won’t excuse their actions, It’s horrendous what they did, but I would challenge the notion that the prison system as it currently stands is equipped to take the people who murdered this poor man and rehabilitate them. It will only exacerbate any violent tendencies they have. But that’s precisely the point, to keep them in prison after they’ve been incarcerated. 

If you’d like to learn more, and understand why Chesa is the opposite of corrupt, read The New Jim Crow, Ghost of the Innocent Man, Just Mercy, and Wretched of the Earth."
berkeley,fphrkee,t1_fpho0y0,1588626509.0,Do you have evidence of that? The history in this country has been to target AA communities and get them arrested on minor drug offenses. Three strikes laws means many people who were arrested in the 90’s are still in jail for pot.
berkeley,fphraph,t1_fphes34,1588626367.0,"This has nothing to do with gang enhancements. That’s sentencing. This is a crime that happened before anyone was arrested. It’s not like some gang members were let out early because of this policy. 

CDCr is notoriously racist. I have a client who has been in solitary for DECADES and was recently placed into a restricted section of the prison because he refuses to “debrief” (Snitch and get consequently shanked) his gang experience. He was in a gang thirty years ago. He has nothing to say. And yet they punish him for it. It’s disgusting. They do this to anyone they can. If you have tattoos? Gang. If you’re black? Gang. It’s a stain on your record. No matter how good you are, how well you do in prison, the system will punish you for your affiliation, real or not. Chesa is putting a stop to these enhancements that target and oppress minority groups. It’s the right thing to do. If you have a cousin in a gang then you’re affiliated, and you get the enhancement. It’s unjust and racist. 

 But this has nothing to do with that! Don’t put this on Chesa. Put it on a capitalist system that creates inequities and fosters environments where gangs thrive."
