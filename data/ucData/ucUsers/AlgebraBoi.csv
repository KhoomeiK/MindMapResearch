UCSC,fovejia,t1_fotfrkl,1588099989.0,"As a biased RE, I think it's pretty split on EE vs RE. EEs can choose to have a fairly chill elective path after 171 (most of the REs I know, myself included, took 171). REs have to take 167, 121, 118, and a graduate course. Yes, we have crap like ce9 & 10, but otherwise it's the same lower div path as CE and EE. EEs definitely can have an equal or harder time, but it really depends on the electives choices. 

Not complaining about my degree as I absolutely love it, but there are only like 20 of us at school so someone's gotta defend our name. 2 design courses, a grad class, and a capstone. Other engineering majors can choose to have this much ""fun"" but no other engineering major is required to by their degree."
