UCSC,foir1jp,t3_g7huvo,1587794270.0,So happy for you!!!!!
UCSC,fodrhw2,t1_fod2pa4,1587688760.0,That’s not necessarily true. I transferred in as a sophomore from community college and only had like 45 credits. I doubt they’ll rescind admissions based on one class. I would still reach out to admissions and be proactive though
UCSC,fmj5nqc,t3_fvjjg9,1586123533.0,"Oh god. I hope this university doesn’t move to P/NP for Spring. I’m happy to see recommendations that letter grades are to be retained but P/NP policies are to be loosened a bit. As much as this whole year has been trash, I want to get letter grades this quarter to bring my GPA up. 

Moving the entire university to P/NP for this quarter without the option of receiving letter grades would be incredibly unfair to a shit ton of students that are applying to grad school, med school , law school this year."
