To be frank, this doesn't resemble traditional Japanese clothing."
UCSC,foyzp61,t1_foyvlu6,1588182151.0,"Is it that few? Admittedly, my experience is mostly limited to the humanities (albeit interdisciplinary) side at UCSC, but I think 50% or more of our PhDs end up as GSIs at least once before going on the market. 

I didn't realize that the situation was different in STEM here, either. Frankly, I'm surprised by that, and worried that UCSC's STEM PhDs are being done a disservice. Although this is speaking from my more limited knowledge on the STEM side of things, I was involved in the hiring of a tenure line at a different institution for biochemistry. After vetting research, the committee was mostly concerned with whether or not the candidates would be able to improve student outcomes in introductory biochemistry courses, and previous experience as a GSI was definitely an asset."
UCSC,foxrr4v,t1_foxr2kk,1588153991.0,"Of course, so much is undetermined. But I can tell you that I've sat in on meetings where admin discussed the events in Georgia and what would happen if other universities and the state government forced our hand. Consensus, at the time, was that we would remain closed until we deemed it safe to re-open. Faculty are already preparing for a virtual Fall quarter."
UCSC,foxor5k,t3_ga5hrp,1588150953.0,The administration at UCSC and UCOP says otherwise. It is highly unlikely that we will be back to face-to-face teaching in the Fall.
UCSC,foxnphk,t1_foxkgj7,1588149917.0,I don't know this particular student but teaching at least one introductory course is the gold standard for advanced PhD candidates. You should have a class or two under your belt before you go on the job market.
AskReddit,foxn32h,t1_foxkpwe,1588149307.0,"Uncut Gems was not worth my time, and during quarantine I have a lot of time."
UCSC,fowjsvu,t3_g9x8wm,1588121166.0,"Normally, I would be inclined to suggest UCLA, even with a Regents Scholarship for UCSC. But you said your program is History and that evens the scores in a lot of ways. 

What kind of history are you interested in? What are your plans for your history degree? If you study Asia, you should think about UCSC."
Professors,fotr4oc,t3_g96nzk,1588063161.0,Why not just phone their advisor?
UCSC,fo9fqdv,t3_g6g735,1587618270.0,"It is one of the strongest humanities departments at UCSC. That said, it really matters what kind of history you are interested in as the strength of the dept is unevenly distributed."
Professors,fny0k0c,t1_fnwnjst,1587350512.0,"Oh, it is definitely a thing.  Americanists and Lacanians, East Asianists and Lacanians, Lacanians and Lacanians..."
Professors,fnw3ic9,t1_fnvp8fb,1587310693.0,"I, for one, take great comfort in this comment. Despite all the disruptions of the pandemic, some things never do change. It's reassuring to know that when I wake up tomorrow, regardless of what has happened, the Lacanian and American Studies scholars of the world will continue to squabble."
Professors,fnvkhcf,t3_g41iuk,1587296629.0,I haven't had an increase in excuse ingenuity because the pandemic itself is a sufficient excuse almost all the time. I'm basically giving students as much time as they need on all deadlines with the understanding that late work might not be promptly returned.
Professors,fnuncju,t3_g3smlz,1587266242.0,"The opinion of anyone who takes RMP seriously is not worth thinking about. If you actually have colleagues that take RMP seriously, then you have a problem with your colleagues, not RMP. If you are on the job market and being judged by your RMP ratings, then that's a signal that you don't want to work in that environment."
Professors,fnufz3n,t1_fnu1g8e,1587261204.0,"To be frank, you are not a colleague and shouldn't expect superiors to address you as such."
UCSC,flq4gcz,t1_fll0jca,1585378737.0,"The relationship between letter grades and percentile scores are set by the professor and can vary class to class. It is not unusual for an 'A' to be 95% and up, which could be the case for your class."
