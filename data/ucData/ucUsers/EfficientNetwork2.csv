UCSC,fnd922l,t1_fnd0gfs,1586863301.0,"I didn't change it, but I called the housing office for the college I applied to (Porter), and I guess due to being a transfer I don't have lowered priority at Porter, even though it's not my affiliated college."
UCSC,fnccezz,t1_fnbygyq,1586833408.0,"If you've already filled it all out, it says ""This preference cannot be edited."" and doesn't let you change it. Room type can be changed, but not community. Either way, I think I've got the situation figured out."

UCSC,fn21yn5,t3_fyvih7,1586575727.0,"Definitely UCs put more emphasis on the theory/academic side of CS. I completely agree with everything you're saying, but there are definitely better schools/majors if you just want to be a software engineer. In case it matters, I also came here with the sole intent of just going into industry and not grad school, knowing full well it would be less practical."
UCSC,fn1270t,t1_fn0s5h5,1586553309.0,"They're trying out 4-year degrees at CC, actually. Currently, 15 CC offering 4-year degrees I believe.  [https://edsource.org/2020/mixed-results-for-californias-experiment-with-community-colleges-offering-bachelors-degrees/622992](https://edsource.org/2020/mixed-results-for-californias-experiment-with-community-colleges-offering-bachelors-degrees/622992)   
When I was at CC, some of the staff I talked to said going forward you can probably get 4-year degrees at CC, but they can't be in competition with an already established 4-year institution nearby. For example, if there's a CSU offering CS 20 miles away, the CC can't offer a 4-year in CS. So, probably won't be offering degrees in something generally available like math or psychology, but maybe more niche areas will."
UCSC,fmyyqgy,t3_fy9jnj,1586500074.0,"See if you can get in on TAG (Transfer Admission Guarantee). TAG basically only cares about academics. Do the pre-requisite classes they want, maintain your GPA, and TAG guarantees you'll get in (assuming you don't misstep somewhere in the logistics of the TAG.)"
UCSC,fmyd93e,t3_fy5158,1586483470.0,"I've only met one person with actually whacky politics. That same person is the only person I've met who seems like a ""weird band kid."" He is a politics major, not a CS major. From what I've seen in CS, there's a ton of 'normal' people, a few who seem possibly autistic, and nobody with unironic crazy politics or crazy personalities. I think people being edgy, on either end of the spectrum, are just doing it for humor or shock value.

All the people I'm close with/talk to frequently don't care if you're not into weed or party culture. Most people I'm close with in CS would rather do programming questions or play video games instead of party or smoke.

I can't really compare the students here to those of other UCs, but during the latest CruzHacks I met a few CS students from UCB, UW, and UCD, and nobody had any stereotypes that would make me say ""oh he's from UCB, UCSC, etc."" I think crazy attracts crazy, and if you're pretty reasonable/accepting/chill, you will have a great time."
