Driving skills are important (until full autopilot is common), and the average person today, at least where I live, is not a great driver, and getting worse. So many simple accidents.

politics,fpbzo8c,t1_fpaoz43,1588483084.0,"Sweden's strategy is not herd immunity.

It is to keep the hospitalization rate below their medical capacity, and let people be cautious on their own. That's why the previous poster implied that Swedish people will do the right thing.

They also acknowledged a mistake in dealing with elder care facilities, where the majority of their cases come from.

Swedish people are satisfied with the national response strategy (so far).

They are also having a much smaller economic contraction than other countries.

We all have a sense of what is right by intuition.

We all understand that a thrown ball will follow a parabolic curve, but then putting numbers to that, and describing it precisely requires a different way of thinking.

You have to learn that.

1. It takes time to learn physics thinking, especially at first. Spend the time earlier than later. You can't cram creating new brain pathways. You can only cram knowledge.
2. Break things down into smaller problems.
3. Know your definitions cold. Speed vs. velocity, and all the others. You are using the same everyday words, but in physics, they have very specific n meanings. You will jump a half to a full grade if you do this.

Good luck.

If we all decided to say f it, whatever happens, happens, I would go along with that, too.

What doesn't work is some people doing this, and some doing that.

Just like on the highway, speed isn't the worst thing. It's difference in speed between different cars. If we are all going the same speed, it is safer than if slow cars are 65mph, and fast cars are 100mph."
