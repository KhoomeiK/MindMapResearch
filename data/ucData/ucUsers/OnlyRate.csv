An example is that dps of a whale can easily exceed the total damage of 10+ casual f2p players. This never happened when you were still playing."

bladeandsoul,fpidj6a,t3_gdcbp8,1588638685.0,"I think first u should finish all the yellow, orange and purple quests then u really should find someone to play with, someone willing to carry u or give u advice. I just returned to this game like 2 weeks ago so I know there’re lots of things changed, u have so many more gears to upgrade compare to 4 years ago. U really need someone tell you which equipment u should upgrade first, what dungeon you should do, so u don’t waste ur time and gold on unnecessary materials or doing the wrong thing. Join a clan or discord would help a lot, or it would be great if you have some friends from 4 years ago are still playing."

Does “A lots of combo” mean higher difficultly? Anyway, I would recommend your friend to try assassin, there’re lots of buttons need to press."
bladeandsoul,fp7p02t,t3_g83clv,1588374849.0,"Gems get from moon refuge can’t be upgraded. The best way to upgrade gems is spending cash on treasure trove and rng boxes. Gems should not be your priority unless you have a lot of money to spend, I mean probably $5k or even more if you are unlucky. Gems give you very little additional damage especially when you think about the costs. The cost of upgrading to endgame gems is enough for you to have endgame weapon and all the endgame accessories."

bladeandsoul,fp0t1m3,t3_gad30p,1588216276.0,How many year has this game been released? So this problem is not going to be solved any time soon.
bladeandsoul,fnko6zx,t3_fyzv5g,1587034566.0,"It’s extremely p2w... But it depends what you wanna do. Do you wanna do endgame content? If so, yeah it’s p2w because you won’t even able to do endgame content if you don’t pay unless you have some really whale friends willing to carry you, what I mean “pay” is not hundred bucks, it’s thousand dollars. The gap between f2p players and p2w players is extremely huge. For example, six f2p players probably will wipe out or take much longer to clear a dungeon, however p2w player can solo it easily without care about mechanic, total dps of six f2p players probably can’t be even comparable to a single extremely whale player. If you just want to do the easiest daily challenge, or just enjoy the main story, then it’s probably not a p2w game."

1. Better optimized? No, and probably worse than before.
2. Lag? Unfortunately, it’s still a problem.
3. I’m not sure what gear level you wanna reach, but you 100% won’t able to do end game content if you don’t pay. The game is even more p2w compare to 2yrs ago.
4. A new raid is coming in one week but it’s a end game content. I want you to know that the current situation of the game is bad, average online population was around 2000, but because the virus average online population has reached 4000 recently. It’s not like years ago f2p players probably can do the end game dungeon together but slower, now it’s just impossible for f2p players to do end game content unless you have some really whale friends willing to carry you."
