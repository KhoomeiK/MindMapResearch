personalfinance,fp8gfcp,t1_fp84rzw,1588391644.0,Start interviewing. Quite a few companies still hiring in the valley.
Expedia,fp0b54g,t1_fp03qng,1588205890.0,"ugh thats a tough situation, sorry to hear :("
Expedia,fp022m0,t1_fozqxn9,1588201028.0,Did the hotel cancel your reservation? More background needed here but you might be able to dispute again depending on which payment processor you used.
Expedia,foz935e,t1_foz2fqp,1588186728.0,what's their basis of disputing? In my case a US bound flight is cancelled so they are obligated to refund under US Department of Transportation rules.
Expedia,foi48xo,t1_fohxw83,1587778390.0,"I got a temporary credit from chargeback, takes two billing cycles to finalize"
Expedia,foec96a,t1_foea79f,1587700403.0,"fairly straightforward. I explained to Chase that the airline is refusing to refund and expedia australia is not reachable. Since my US bound flight was cancelled, I am eligible for a refund under department of transportation rules.  


I got a credit immediately, but based on my understanding it can still be disputed so fingers crossed."

berkeley,fmywvfl,t3_fy8rzm,1586498277.0,"UChicago is extremely theory heavy. There’s this joke about the school: it sounds great in application, but how does it work in theory?

Berkeley CS might be a better fit for you because you can explore both practical and theory CS coursework.

In terms of rigor, it'll probably be similar at both schools. I absolutely loved the campus vibe at UChicago, but I can't say I'm a fan of the weather. You'll have better recruitment opportunities at Berkeley since UChicago is not usually on a target CS school list, so that's something you have to keep in mind. I work at one of the FAANG and I rarely met anyone from UChicago.

UChicago also doesn't have engineering (with the exception of a new-ish BioE engineering program), so if you change your mind about your major you might have to switch to a completely different school.

Class sizes are definitely smaller at UChicago though, just something to keep in mind.

edit: just realized I misquoted. It should be UChicago has this saying about how it’s “where fun comes to die”. They have similar self deprecating humor like us :)

edit 2: also they run on a quarter system instead of semester, which imo sucks"
berkeley,fmrm3tv,t1_fmr9g6h,1586327488.0,"* Program: overall Berkeley CS is better, more prestigious and rigorous than Cornell CS (granted I'm biased here)
* Class size: Cornell CS likely will have smaller class sizes  
* Class registration: probably easier at Cornell
* Weather: Berkeley wins hands down  
* Culture: Berkeley wins hands down  
* Surrounding area safety: Ithaca is probably safer  
* Things to do: Berkeley/SF has a lot more to do than Ithaca
* Recruiting: Berkeley has a slight advantage because of proximity to Silicon Valley
* Declaring: Not having the stress to declare will definitely be a lot nicer at Cornell

Visit both campuses and see which one you like more as well."
berkeley,fmr93dq,t3_fwxe9k,1586316824.0,What's the price difference? Is cost an issue?
taiwan,fmiilq9,t3_fvarcv,1586110303.0,I wish the US is doing this
