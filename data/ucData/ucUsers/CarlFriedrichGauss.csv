The nonstick pans eventually have to get replaced once every 3 or so years even though I never use them (except for eggs), but others will use them when cooking. The Le Creuset definitely holds up better but I've only had it for 2 years so far."
BuyItForLife,fovz9rz,t1_fovlbbi,1588110150.0,">Apparently as with cast iron the more you cook it eventually builds a carbon layer that is fairly non-stick.

I always thought that when people say this, they are referring to non-enameled cast iron because when you season a cast iron skillet you are polymerizing oils onto bare iron. On the other hand, people usually say DON'T season enamel cast iron, even if it is the satin black enamel from Le Creuset. 

I do have a set of Tramontina tri-ply fully clad stainless that I love and think they look awesome, but I'm also lazy and cast iron is easier to clean because the black color hides stains, so the cast iron gets use 95% of the time. 

Enamel cast iron does look beautiful but I do feel like it's a bit redundant to have. I'll probably get one when I save up enough money but even upgrading to All-Clad seems like a better use of it if I'm trying to be frugal."
BuyItForLife,fovr07e,t1_fovny5a,1588106023.0,"Thanks for the details. I've been using a Lodge since I was a sophomore in university and it always held up great. I gave it away when I moved and tried to replace it with a crappy made in China Walmart Ozark Trail brand set which was so awful I had the machine shop at work sand it down for me. It's still pretty bad but after 3 years of using it it's good enough. 

Acidic stuff has never been an issue for me as I mostly cook fairly non-acidic Asian foods. It is good to know that the enamel is fairly durable though. And I do wish that the bare cast iron were a bit easier to clean. I agree that they get weirdly gummy if you don't control your heat properly or try to sear too many steaks in a row. Do you ever use metal spatulas in your enamel? I usually do quite a bit of scraping with a flat metal spatula on my bare cast iron as I cook so that it's easier to clean in the end."
BuyItForLife,fovhsha,t1_fov6mul,1588101542.0,"How nonstick are these compared to non-enamel cast iron? Also, how durable is the enamel on the inside compared to bare cast iron?

I do like how they look but I don’t really see how enameling cast iron really improves it at all. It becomes more sensitive to extreme heat and changes in temperature so you can’t get them as rip roaring hot, plus you’re not supposed to use metal utensils in them or you will scratch the white enamel. The black ones (ie Staub) are also enamel but just black colored and also shouldn’t be used with metal. Also the outside gets dirty whereas an unenameled cast iron hides all of the burnt crud from the black color.

In that regard they really are the Ferrari of pans while the simple old Lodge is more like the Camry. Lodge Chef’s Collection is also like the Avalon."

grilling,foqocn3,t1_foqi8f9,1587997798.0,"I have no problem with rare steaks, but I don't really find them to be more or less flavorful or tender with a medium rare vs medium or even a medium well. 

The thing that affects tenderness the most is just choosing a good steak like choice or higher grade and as long as it's not extra well done it's tender enough. Cutting against the grain is probably the next most important, and that's why I like to cut (after resting) on a cutting board [at an angle](https://img.wonderhowto.com/img/07/91/63573617101495/0/cut-cooked-steak-right-way.w1456.jpg), because sometimes the grain actually runs vertically. If it's been salted a good long time that helps a lot with tenderness too. As someone who doesn't mind rare or even steak tartare I actually find that less than a medium rare is too soft, too messy, and not enough chew. But it's still good.

The thing that affects flavor the most is making sure it has been salted a while, and then the next most important thing is to get a good dark and even crust on the outside. That means no grill marks, because that indicates a missed opportunity to brown the space between the marks.

By the way, your steak has an awesome color both inside an out. What method did you use for the sear?"

asianamerican,fnjyvug,t3_g24zsh,1587010327.0,"Okay CNBC, how about this article from CNBC? [Zoom, one of the most anticipated tech IPOs of the year, has one key profit driver: engineers in China](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/26/zoom-key-profit-driver-ahead-of-ipo-engineers-in-china.html)

I don't really disagree with Pelosi here and tbh I think this sub is kind of getting played and becoming a pro-China sub lately. As other comments have stated, Zoom might be founded in the US but hires very few American software engineers compared to the amount they hire in China. That's kind of their key business advantage. There are very legitimate questions about Zoom and its security practices that just so happen to make encryption keys in China sometimes, let alone having numerous other random security flaws. No company should be using Zoom if they care about security. And I really hope no governments are using it. It's probably okay for schools and it's kind of too late anyways because so many have already been giving lessons and lectures on it."

I didn't have any fungal sensitivities before trying out the cream and I hugely regret ever using it. It's a mystery why the formula for tret cream even includes it because to me it's a terrible acne causing ingredient.

Still, $11 for 70 ml is pretty cheap. The green cap is the latest one although I think the 50 ml tube is the same product (don't quote me on that though). I stick to fungal acne safe because I know for sure that fungal acne ingredients trigger breakouts in me. The UV filters it uses are: Tinosorb S, Avobenzone, Octinoxate, Octisalate, Octocrylene. Tinosorb S is better than basically all US-approved UVA filters and also stabilizes avobenzone so you can be sure you're getting good UVA protection as well as UVB.

The [Skinfood Dragonfruit Sun Essence](https://www.ebay.com/itm/SKINFOOD-Dragon-Fruit-Powerful-Sun-Essence-SPF50-PA-50ml/273998130401?epid=811557233&hash=item3fcb8face1:g:2hQAAOSwXnZekRo~) is kind of rare, but was cheapest on Shinsegae and cost nearly 2x at Skinfood stores. I remember it was like 2x50ml for $14 or something. It was described in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8vdvfp/discussionsunscreens_with_both_tinosorb_s_and/) to have both Tinosorb S and Tinosorb M which is at the pinnacle of modern UV protection so far. 

There are some more products [listed here that are available in 100ml or larger packages.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8wa7kn/discussion_korean_sunscreens_available_in_high/) Brands like Missha, A'PIEU, Tony Moly, and Skinfood are fairly affordable whereas brands like Dr Jart and Belif are kind of the luxury cosmeceutical brands (IMO waste of money). You probably will be able to find them cheaper than Jolse by looking on ebay. All retailers have at least a 25% markup and they might also charge for shipping, so shop around."

cars,fn41vuj,t1_fn3sv8w,1586632373.0,"He's fine if you care about reliability about all else and gives ojay advice. He hates on cars with too much luxury or performance because those things inherently make a car more unreliable. Sorry to the other commenters but being the most reliable Porsche doesn't even make it anywhere near as reliable as a Yaris, which isn't even a Toyota (made by Mazda). 

Most of his knowledge is from the ""school of hard knocks"" and he doesn't always do everything by the book which irritates people here ie using products off-label despite the fact that it worked for him and his customers for years. 

The jack stand thing was like in one video where he was saying if you absolutely don't have one you can just change a tire without one or do quick work, especially if you live somewhere flat with no earthquakes like Houston where he lives. He uses jack stands in every single other video and even makes a point of it.

I enjoy his videos because it seems like every other reviewer is just generic irritating car journalist that hates on everything that isn't a performance luxury sedan (and lately, performance luxury SUVs). Not many people really give daily driving economy cars a fair chance and he's the opposite of every other car reviewer because the only thing he cares about is reliability. I'm mostly interested in normal cars and savagegeese is like the only other reviewer I enjoy. Regular car reviews is kind of too sarcastic and more of a comedy channel than informative."
