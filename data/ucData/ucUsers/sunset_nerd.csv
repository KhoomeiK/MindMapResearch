UCI,fop8ogx,t3_g8rrwd,1587955566.0,"With housing limiting their occupancy, it looks like next quarter/year might be remote. There’s the possibility that we won’t have in person classes, so I would carefully consider whether or not the expense of housing is worth it to move out here.

I know it would suck to have to start freshmen year from home but I recommend waiting for more updates before signing a lease for housing."

UCI,foio7ic,t1_foikrym,1587791854.0,"They’re trying their best and I feel like UCI has actually done a pretty good job with the whole situation. They made a tough decision early to make Spring quarter online at a critical point in time to flatten the curve and save students from getting infected.

UCI has also done a lot to support us through the transition: buying everyone Zoom accounts ($750,000/month), getting us out of housing contracts (~$30 million), improving the campus VPN, helping professors move online, laptop loan programs, etc.

One other thing to keep in mind is that COVID is probably affecting them badly too. I’m sure they have family/friends who are infected and with the substantial loss of revenue, they are always aware that there is a possibility that professional staff will get laid off.

COVID sucks for everyone, not just us."

> There’s a lot of uncertainty right now, which is why they can’t guarantee that housing will be able to open at full capacity in the fall.
> 
> I know the thought of not dorming can be really unsettling. While it’s something we might need to prepare for, no final decisions have been made yet about what’s going to happen in the fall.
> 
> Keep in mind, the University will do everything it can to try and SAFELY open because if the freshmen can’t live in the dorms, that would be a huge financial hit and professional staff will have to be laid off/furloughed. 
> 
> There’s a chance that housing might even open with limited capacity (less people in one building) but no one knows what it will be like a few months from now.
> 
> So to summarize: mentally prepare for the possibility but remember that no decisions have been made yet and housing will do everything possible to try and give you the best and safest first year experience."

The biggest thing for internships isn’t your grades. Side projects are way more impactful. Try to build something! It can be in Python or you can branch out and learn something new. 

What kind of internships are you specifically looking for?"
