leagueoflegends,fpm4ywf,t1_fpm4azs,1588725664.0,"In my experience with smurfs, most don’t sandbag. Often, they’re doing like new acc to (insert some high rank here) challenges and want to get as high a winrate as possible, and sandbagging would defeat that purpose. Sure, there may be some who are sandbagging because they want to stay at a certain rank, but banning would only help them too, as they would get banned, make another smurf, and be easily back at whatever rank they were supposedly sandbagging to stay at."
leagueoflegends,fpm4kq0,t3_ge2h95,1588725432.0,"I’ve played a lot of swain support this season in mid diamond Elo, and I agree, he’s been wrecked for midlane (though he was never a midlaner to begin with). He’s okay toplane, as a ranged champ with some sustain and cc, but I personally believe he excels as a support. 

I agree with u on the Q, it definitely needs some work because it just doesn’t feel like meaningful damage. This is not a big deal as support, but it definitely could be better.

His W is great for blocking champs into tanking his e, which when combined with electrocute and passive, easily bursts for a chunk of damage, and brings them closer to him for the adc to finish them off. 

His E is one of the hardest to dodge cc skillshots out of any support, except maybe neeko or bard, given that you can hit it in the middle of the minion wave if you’re good. It’s great for zoning off the enemy adc and making sure they can’t last hit minions. Combined with his passive, it becomes a pull which also returns health and mana, which is kinda nutty. 

His R allows him to deal a large amount of damage while staying alive even if he’s at the front of the fight. Combine this with a zhonyas, and you are able to buy so much time for your team, all while doing damage. At the same time, it’s ability to instantly give him more max health makes it great for staying alive if they have a burst assassin. 

Together, these abilities make him a solid support, but I do understand wanting him to have an identity outside of the support role. I think an overhaul of the q would make this possible, with maybe minor tweaks to the other abilities."

The situation is definitely a bit weird, but I can understand where both sides are coming from. On your girlfriends side, sometimes it’s easiest to pretend that nothing happened when a guy friend does something like that because then he’ll give up, and you don’t lose a friend. On your side, it’s probably stressful knowing that there’s someone asking your gf for nudes (and on your anniversary no less). The fact that she won’t remove him only adds to the stress that there’s more going on there than you’re seeing. The best thing you can do is sit down and talk to her! Let her know about how much/why it’s bothering you. If she doesn’t remove him knowing how uncomfortable it makes you, then you can reassess. It’s likely though that she didn’t realize how much it bothered you, and had been looking for the easiest solution, which was to pretend it hadn’t happened. Good luck :)"
berkeley,fp572u6,t1_fp56q07,1588318566.0,"I haven’t actually taken either, so I’m not entirely sure. From what I know, CS10 is a more general overview of how programming works, and uses snap (I think) to teach general computer logic, before getting into python at the end. Data 8, on the other hand, is a bit more focused on python and its uses for analyzing data (as it is a data science class). That being said, it’s also not too complicated and should provide a good intro to python. I’ve had friends in both classes, and they all seemed prepared for 61A (they’re in it this semester) regardless of which class they took, so it’s really up to you.

Another thing you could try is auditing CS61A over the summer (as all lectures, labs, and discussions are posted online) to get a feel for the material and see if you feel like you need to take CS10 or Data 8."

That being said, the class is incredibly well balanced to make it possible to achieve the grade you put in the effort for. They also have plenty of resources specifically for people who have never coded before. If you prefer to have a bit of background going in, go ahead and do CS10 or Data8, but it isn’t necessary as long as you’re willing to work hard and not stress too much if it seems scary at first.

Berkeley is common app, so unless you’re applying just here, I’d say you can’t use this much on your essays, but in terms of picking extracurriculars etc this is the way to go. Don’t do something because you think it’ll look better on an application, do something because you like it, and are passionate about it. If this can incorporate volunteering etc, great, if you’re working a part time job or taking care of siblings and don’t have time to volunteer, that’s great too.

Whatever you do, do it with passion, because that will be a better story than anything you felt like you “needed to do” to get in here."

As for other classes, sometimes the class has a waitlist at first, then they make it bigger, so you might be seeing posts about before they increase the class size. Good luck!

berkeley,for99zm,t1_for8gjx,1588008350.0,"So the schedule for the class, at least when I was in it, had lab before discussion, so I always ended up doing it the way you said (I had my lab on Monday and discussion on Wednesday). I would say this is a good order because usually labs are intro-level problems, discussion has intro and some harder problems, and the homework is probably the hardest of the three.

The guerrilla sections are something they would offer before midterms, where students would get into groups and do the worksheets together. The whole group had to understand the problems before anyone moved on, so it wasn’t just about completing the problem, but about making sure everyone understood it. Iirc the problems on guerrilla worksheets are good starting practice for midterm questions because they were a bit easier than the typical exam questions.

I would say tree recursion doesn’t come up TOO often in 61b, as I think I’ve only used it once or twice so far (though you can use it more if you prefer it). The bigger things that come up are the basic loops etc, OOP, runtimes (which barely gets taught in 61a and you go over a lot more in 61b) and data structures such as trees and linked lists. It’s also a good idea to have a solid understanding of how pointers work, because that transfers over between a lot of different languages."

berkeley,fony5ft,t1_fonxh3b,1587928779.0,"Damn! Sorry then :( Tree recursion is IMO the hardest concept of 61A, and I don’t think I really understood it til the final. If you can, I’d say look at some previous exam questions on tree recursion, and start looking for patterns. For example, tree recursive base cases often include one of the parameters reaching zero or 1, (if they’re numerical) so make sure in the recursive call you’re looking decreasing that parameter so it eventually hits the base case. This was what really helped me get it by the final, just lots of practice and understanding how the base cases and connect to the recursive call. 

The other thing that helps is to think of a what your “tree cases” are in English, then think about how you can put that in code. This could mean like “I either include or don’t include the last digit of this number” the figuring out how to slice off the digits so that this is the case. Good luck!"

Since you’re not, have you looked at the 61A piazza? I could be wrong, but I believe anyone can join, and that’s a great place to look for help and see if anyone has any similar questions.

berkeley,fonptel,t3_g8iepb,1587924113.0,"Like the other commenter, option 2 is probably your best bet. It sounds like you have quite a bit of experience with python, so as long as you’re willing to put in the work when Scheme and SQL come around, 61A shouldn’t be too bad. With your experience in Physics E&M, and having already taken Math 53, 7B shouldn’t be too bad either. 

Option 1 is definitely doable, but 16A is a class where you learn some of the most important material from the labs, and I don’t think it would be ideal to take it with everything going on rn.

Very few high elo players “jump into a normals game if they fancy a stomp”. More often, they jump into a norms to play with their (often lower-ranked) friends, almost the same as what you’re doing, except they are a higher rank. They could also be playing offrole, or trying a new champ. That’s what norms is for!

One thing you could do instead of doing core classes for Econ or CS is take some breadth courses, as L&S has quite a few breadth requirements on top of the university ones. It depends on if you have a lot of AP credits fulfilling those requirements already, but during the year a lot of the university requirements (American history, American culture, Writing) fill up pretty quickly, so it can be hard to get one you want.

It really depends on you, your work ethic, and what you want to get out of freshman edge as a whole! 

If you can get a breadth out of the way, those are great too! They often fill up quickly during the year and it can be hard to get a spot in one you really like."
berkeley,foejdky,t3_g727z3,1587705311.0,"Hi! I’m a freshman atm, and from what I can tell, AP’s either give 5.36 units, or 2.68 (why these numbers I have no idea). Most core classes (Calc BC, Lang, APUSH, Spanish/Languages) give 5.36, whereas other classes (Physics C: Mechanics, Statisics) give 2.68. You are expected to take 32 units a year (16 a semester) so you can technically come into Cal with a sophomore standing! Hope this helps :)"
