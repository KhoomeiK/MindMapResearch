UCSD,fpmgkq8,t3_ge69st,1588732613.0,It said somewhere in the email that they will test large samples monthly. I've always liked the frequent/aggressive testing strategy and think it's great they're trying to implement it on campus. It will definitely help. Hopefully they can get to a point where they could test a far greater percentage and stop any sick person immediately.

However, if you have no access to a laptop and cannot rent one from the school, your best bet would be to email your professor beforehand so there is a plan in the event that it doesn't work for you.

Is this where you're at now? You falsely claimed on several occasions that I made certain statements; there is nothing childish about pointing these out. If it was never stated, don't quote it as such. This will help you in the future. Also, WRITING LIKE THIS TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS ISN'T MATURE IN THE LEAST.

Forgive me if I came upon that block of text and decided I'd be better off reading my coursework. I had classes to attend to earlier. 

Again, serological testing is only the first step if it is proven that acquired immunity is significant. Currently, scientists are unsure whether actually having antibodies against this is enough to ward off a reinfection. Many that experienced mild forms of the disease have such low concentrations of the antibodies that scientists do not believe they would remain immune for any significant period. Until this is known, no, it will not be our first step. 

Again, calm down with putting words in my mouth. You keep claiming I've made statements that are nowhere to be found in my text. Nowhere did I suggest an aggressive reopening. Is it that you consider partial in-person for fall quarter to be aggressive? Is that what it is? 

Obviously flattening of the curve is a non-pharmaceutical effort; don't be dense. Do you not believe the methods I described previously are non-pharmaceutical? Increased PPE production, alterations in sanitation procedures, proper spacing in classes and in the workplace...You honestly consider these to be pharmaceutical methods? You don't believe these efforts would provide us some control around the behavior of the curve? You can't honestly believe that lockdown is the only means by which spread can be decreased...do you?

You are acquiring groceries while in lockdown presently aren't you? How might this change outside of lockdown? I recommend spraying lysol quickly over your groceries, washing your hands and sanitizing after putting everything away. 

The US does not have the capacity to continue providing paychecks to its people, especially for any prolonged period. Those countries you listed differ greatly from us. You just earlier told me I could not compare our situation to S. Korea because of their different healthcare. So here, I'm telling you you can't compare our financial situation with that of other countries. We're too in debt and we are too populous. 

Where did you voice for an indefinite lockdown? You've voiced that so long as thousands are dying, we must remain in lockdown. You've agreed with the post that fall quarter online is necessary as the spread and the mortality rate will remain significant through fall (per the points in that post). You've also acknowledged that the virus is likely to mutate often like the other yearly coronaviruses. Considering all of this...yes, one could deduce that you support indefinite lockdown - that is, lockdown with no known end so long as it is still spreading with it's 1% or less mortality rate...lockdown until there is a cure.

I don't doubt your condition. The word ""claim"" does not indicate that I do not believe it. Regardless, you alone make the choice to go out or stay home. You can remain in lockdown if you so choose.

I'm not sure what you're getting at with your ""privilege"" sentence. I wrote that you're more fortunate than others who face the threat of losing their homes. I assume that those facing the possibility of losing their home aren't fighting for continued lockdown.

I don't dismiss serology tests. When we have one that is accurate, it will be very useful. But one failed test isn't the end.

Fighting for universal healthcare would be futile in the coming months. It is not a requirement for aggressive testing to take place. We need something now. I fight only for increased production of tests and tracing. This would allow return.

To rephrase, even with regulations in place, there is a 0.97% chance that you will die in a car crash (and you've agreed that this number is significant). Yet we continue driving.

As far as the last bit, you seem not to have read anything I've ever written. That or it appears that I've convinced you and you're playing along as though it was your own idea."
UCSD,fp0ojb9,t1_fozosok,1588213490.0,"No, I'm not your professor but it appears you still expect me to read it. I've tried going back to pull out some of your points, but I'm sure to have missed a few that become lost in that block of text. Again, the fact that early serology tests are not accurate does not alone prove it necessary to remain in lockdown. This was the main point of the linked post. There are many other factors to consider when assessing the time and the way in which we return.

If any combination of these comes forth, we will have progress: better hospital preparedness, availability of PPE for civilians, a flat and declining curve, evidence of acquired immunity to the virus or of a weakened virus in mid-summer temperatures, spacing requirements in work/school spaces, changes in sanitation procedures around campuses/workplaces, availability of testing for live virus, etc etc. I don't believe serology tests were the sole factor in anyone's decision to gradually re-open. More than anything, it has been optimism around some of the factors I listed above as well as the fact that people around America are missing rent/mortgage payments and are unable to fill their fridge. Having a small business in your family doesn't put you in the same category as everyone else that has lost their paycheck to paycheck jobs. Our healthcare system and research capacity both depend on a strong economy. It isn't the case that after a year of lockdown, the grants will still be flowing and the scientists will be plowing ahead. Also in consideration is the likelihood that this will not simply go away - the realization that we may be living with this for some time. This virus has come too far.

You claim that you're immunocompromised and that you don't want to risk your life. Sorry, what do you believe it is I've asked you to do? Nobody anywhere has proposed that you remove yourself from lockdown. If the city re-opens and the school partially re-opens, you have every right to stay home and to continue sanitizing anything that comes through your door. Don't risk your life for me. You have the right to make your own decisions.

Nothing above indicates my interest in an increased production of tests and masks? What, the fact that I wasn't convinced with one failed, early serology test? Again, we're discussing whether or not return should occur in the fall. More serology tests will come forth through the next few months (assuming this is truly a priority to Newsom). However, the serology test isn't as helpful to us if we do not know the extent of immunity acquired. We need tests that will check for the live virus and we need to quickly quarantine those that test positive. Without universal health care, we can still make it a goal to provide tests to all. Aggressively tackling this now will save us in many regards in the long run, so yes, we should put our money into increased production of all aforementioned items now.

""Driving fatalities can't be prevented by something as simple as wearing a mask"". How can you make this claim while arguing that lockdown and online classes are necessary? According to this statement, simply wearing masks will allow safe return. If you step out of the house, even with a mask on, there's a chance you'll acquire the disease. If you go for a drive, there's a chance you will be hit by another car. The two indeed are comparable, for in either of the two outings, there is a chance you will die. When do you consider that chance significant enough to disallow the activity altogether or to shut down the country? The 0.17% is of those above 30 that are actually infected. If a 30 year old steps out for a run, there is not a 0.17% chance that they will die from COVID19."

Frankly, I believe it's inevitable that this is the case, but clearly there is no way to determine an exact number. Again, I don't recall listing an exact number...Can you please point this number out in my post? It would be unscientific to misquote someone.

*All* of our decisions currently are based on predictions. Predictions currently tend toward there being some recovery in the summer. You've provided no evidence, nor has that linked article, that this is going to surge before or during fall. Here you are attacking me for not having scientific evidence that this is going to get better.

As another user stated above, the number of deaths depends on whatever was written on the death certificate. This differs by region.

Again, if an individual's chances of dying in a vehicular crash is greater than this 0.17%, should we not disallow driving in our country?

Yes, you're right, the goal is to not overrun hospitals. Hence, the initial return would be controlled.

Lastly, do consider the families that aren't as lucky as yours in this present time. Homelessness and starvation is a greater threat to many than a virus with a 1% (if that) death rate. How fortunate you are to continue so ignorantly believing that the world can remain in lockdown indefinitely. Is it not the case that these UC schools are major employers for the cities that they serve? Do you not wonder how the staff members that served you lunch are presently managing to get by? I'd personally take covid-19 infection over loss of my home and grocery money.

I personally want us to model after S. Korea. I want aggressive testing and tracing through the summer followed by a gradual return. It is not feasible to remain in lockdown until this is gone. This will not simply be gone... Nor will a vaccine 1-2 years from now eradicate it. This is an RNA virus. This will mutate like the other coronaviruses and we will be chasing it every year.

Sure, you've been bothered but weren't posting like this about needing an answer.

You aren't affecting the progression of their decision by stressing here like this. Some La Jolla article today quoted Khosla as saying ""most"" courses are planned to be in person."
UCSD,foyryb1,t1_foxt55l,1588178068.0,"If UC Berkeley is online it will be because they are on the semester system and begin sooner...

Is the lack of an accurate serology test at the moment necessarily proof that the pandemic is headed downhill? Even without it, as this guy writes, the transmission rates are high enough that we can predict far more of us have had it than has been determined...Especially considering the first US covid deaths occurred in the bay."
UCSD,foypoce,t3_gaamc9,1588176871.0,People complained about UCSD before but imagine what it would be if UCSD stayed closed through next winter?...broke as a joke.
UCSD,foypha0,t3_gab30c,1588176765.0,"Yeah it's not cool. I'll be at 35 units after this quarter, though I plan to enroll in summer...They better not have something to say about that 1 unit."
UCSD,foyp57p,t1_fow826g,1588176584.0,Dude they are still discussing this. You wouldn't have been this bothered if it were that they didn't tell us anything at all this week... Why do you need to now right *now* as opposed to one or two weeks from now?
UCSD,foyon2o,t1_fow1meq,1588176311.0,Yeah I hope it doesn't come to that. Most upper respiratory illnesses don't take off in summer though so I can't imagine that it would really surge before fall...maybe slight peaks and dips in spread but nothing dramatic
UCSD,foyoelx,t1_fovzmu9,1588176185.0,"But also, the best part about this is that this means a significant number of us already have antibodies...long lasting immunity? It hasn't been confirmed. But surely the short term immunity would help for the coming months."
UCSD,foyo60r,t1_fovtdkq,1588176060.0,"...pretty sure the elderly professors will not be asked to return for in-person  in the fall....The school knows better than that.

What purpose would it serve to open the school to in-person solely for discussion sections?  Surely, they will have some in-person lecture options.

&#x200B;

Here, Khosla describes fall quarter as being *mostly* in-person.

UCSD,foyn7uu,t1_foxfbhn,1588175559.0,Extra stress? This made me feel a lot better this week knowing I wouldn't have to put up with 8 more months of online courses. Be patient and let them discuss their plans further in detail. They literally just now made the announcement.
UCSD,foyn0fr,t1_foxqfe6,1588175451.0,Ooh...probably not a great time for time abroad!
UCSD,foy4h42,t1_foxzpi9,1588165089.0,"I agree with you. People in those comments are simply kissing their professor's ass. 

And even while an over-estimate, the chances are greater of dying in a vehicle crash. Why not prevent people from driving?"
UCSD,foxupby,t3_ga5c63,1588156923.0,"The post attacked the accuracy of the serology tests, described the virus as airborne, and described a 0.17% mortality rate in 30-39 yr olds as significant. However, how from this could it be predicted that UCB would be entirely online? What was it in the post that you found to be particularly revealing? 

There is still a great possibility that this virus is weakened in the summer...This coupled with summer lockdown or distancing could be significant. If we then drastically increase testing and tracing capabilities..."
UCSD,foxoonr,t1_foxlzwx,1588150884.0,"It honestly sounds like there will be more online sections available than in-person...so from your perspective I wouldn't be concerned. I imagine you could easily find 3-4 classes to take online in the fall.

I unfortunately think the in-person ones are going to be harder to come by. One professor/redditor on here was saying they're considering making the 50+ student classes online...well, that's the majority of classes... smh. All of my UD bio classes are 50+..."
UCSD,foxgxr0,t1_fowjsta,1588143660.0,"Yes, aggressive testing would get us to that point. However, it simply has not been made a priority in our country. We're getting somewhere but I believe we could have gotten there a lot sooner if it had been prioritized."
UCSD,foxciwt,t1_fox0gm2,1588139922.0,An add on: I'd like at least a class or two of mine to be in person. It'd be unfortunate for me personally to be stuck with all online classes again. Most of my classes are 50+ students...I'm hoping they could do hybrid classes and give us the option to choose.
UCSD,foxc0sf,t1_fowaeh0,1588139505.0,"There's a professor/redditor above that says they're still discussing how to handle classes, but that it currently appears that classes greater than 50 will be remote and those smaller can be either online or in-person...

I don't see why knowing the littlest details at this point in time is necessary."
UCSD,foxbisu,t1_fox1az2,1588139100.0,Yeah it'd be nice if we never had to struggle. But sometimes the only two paths before us are absolute shit.
UCSD,foxbfm9,t1_fox1g2q,1588139031.0,"In-person exams are not feasible with a significant number of students remaining home for the quarter - they would be more likely to cheat...thus to perform better than those that appear in person. The in-person is most beneficial for learning and for getting to know the professors (from a distance of 6+ ft)...I didn't argue for in-person primarily for the right to take the exams in person haha

Would this not work?: One professor teaches a large class of multiple sections..Of those sections, only a few are in-person and the remainder online. Ditch Zoom for some other platform. Even Youtube has a live option and it is more accessible. A TA can operate the live stream from a front row seat and ask questions as they appear in the chat."
UCSD,foxagpa,t1_fox4ubq,1588138260.0,The UC system overall lost over 500million in March because of the coronavirus set back...that probably translates to about a 100 million loss for UCSD for just that one month.
UCSD,foxaejc,t1_fox7cfe,1588138212.0,"It sounds like they're still planning

They just released a major decision so we should give em more time for all the little details."
UCSD,foxab8a,t1_fox8kzd,1588138140.0,lmao idk life is like that sometimes
UCSD,fox0pz4,t3_ga0j9i,1588131328.0,"I know I'm the odd one out here but I'd rather deal with it as it is now (+the recreation fees) than deal with major cuts later (department faculty cuts, larger class sizes in the coming year, higher tuition, etc)."
UCSD,fox0gm2,t3_g9xk8d,1588131155.0,"It'd be nice to know if we would have the option to choose for most classes. For a given class, will there be some in-person sections and some online? Or will certain classes only have the online option?"
UCSD,fowzxlh,t1_fowlhnw,1588130809.0,I think they consider it possible because a significant number of students will choose the entirely-online option and live at home with their families.
UCSD,fowzi7d,t1_fov1u8h,1588130540.0,They should divide the larger classes such that some sections are in-person and other sections online. And do away with zoom...
UCSD,fowy3fp,t1_fovscw2,1588129656.0,Not enough people would choose to boycott in fall for this idea to be effective at all. The handful of people taking it off because they want DeVry  pricing won't hurt the University.
UCSD,fowxwd9,t1_fowk22v,1588129537.0,Last year I didn't sign my lease until late August. You won't be hurtin if you're having to look a month or two from now. And with fewer students down here for in-person you should be able to find something...
UCSD,fow5onx,t1_fovs1yf,1588113484.0,"I'm sure you can expect to hear updates about these little details in the coming weeks. I didn't sign my lease until August...I think you would be fine to look for an apartment in a month or two if you decided to do fall in-person. Give them some time. They made a decision like we asked, now just give them a little more time to make plans around that decision."
UCSD,fow4wsy,t1_fow0e3d,1588113071.0,"Profs aren't gonna have a hard time lmao what extra work do they have to do? The give lecture and the audio is recorded and uploaded just like before. 

Physics lab - TAs record themselves doing the experiment and provide you the data. Not sure why it would be any different for you in the fall if you chose to stay online."
UCSD,fow4i6i,t1_fovv88n,1588112861.0,But what could they possibly clarify? The circumstances are entirely unpredictable - they have no control over natural events. How could they provide an answer with certainty?
UCSD,fovvexv,t1_fovsqil,1588108197.0,"As there is no guarantee about the behavior of new viruses, nobody could possibly give you the definitive answer you are looking for. This isn't just UCSD, this is every university in the nation. But these are their plans and they will stick with them unless there is a sudden resurgence. 

With summer temperatures, I personally doubt there will be."
UCSD,fovustc,t1_fovtqc5,1588107893.0,"I highly doubt they would regulate that. What would be the point? They want a careful return to campus and that would mean not having everyone come rushing back. 

If anything, I think it would be more difficult to get the in-person classes because they have to keep restrictions on the number of students per room."
UCSD,fovs1cq,t1_fovrd4d,1588106532.0,"Sounds like it entirely depends which mode you prefer: in-person or online. 

You're thinking they might only allow international students the online option? Not sure they would really put effort into regulating that...also it's beneficial to have a portion of students just staying online to prevent overcrowding in classrooms."
UCSD,fovrlnz,t1_fovrfap,1588106316.0,"What do you mean? The fact that the situation is apt to change is stressing you out?

Edit: Ok, just now received this message in my school email."
