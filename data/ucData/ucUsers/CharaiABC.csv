ElgatoGaming,fn271qk,t1_fn0mbvr,1586579648.0,"I'd like my face cam to stay in sink with my gameplay, latency isn't a huge deal (thought Idk how much I'll stream yet). I was leaning toward capture card as well, since I want to capture consoles from time to time. Mostly my switch.

UCSC,fn15poz,t3_fym2dy,1586555315.0,"Alexander Sher 5B, he's adapted his format very well to online learning. Almost feels like I'm in his class lectures in 5C again honestly. PHYSICS 5BC

Todd Lowe BME110, very passionate, informative, and funny. He keeps devoting so much time to organizing the class and providing the resources we need. Always open to emails and meetings, and I've had few late night emails with him. Very understanding of student struggles. Couldnt ask for more. He lost a lecture recording yesterday and was super sad. When the TA had their own version and sent him it, he was so ecstatic, it was very wholesome to see his reaction. BME 110

Edit 1:
Shiva Abbaszadeh ECE 80B new class.  She's trying her best to balance her baby, this new class, grants/labs, and everything else. She's full of joy and hope and you can definitely tell her first quarter of instruction is stressing her out, but she's putting in all the effort and resources that she can. ECE 80B 

Edit 2:
I wanted to add professors that I'm not taking this quarter. I figured I'd include them all.

Caitlin Binder was great for 8A. Very passionate and energetic, and spends a lot of time trying to help people understand the labs and class. She breaks down a lot of harder more detailed topics into something more manageable, and is very humble about it. CHEM 8A

Christopher Vollmers is very light hearted and explains molecular biology very well. Everything he expects is very reasonable, concise, all the while being entertaining. BIOL 101

Stephen Ritz for physics. I was terrified of physics after a poor AP physics experience with my teacher's first time with the class. I originally wanted to be a nuclear engineering/physicist I was doing somewhat poorly and lacked the self esteem to keep going. I was planning to switch majors (current major to something else) and thought I had to give up what I wanted to do. He's the first professor that I went to an office hours for. He helped trouble shoot what issues I had with the subject and gave me the self esteem to stick with my major. I have him in my dedication for my thesis, that I plan to finish this year. I wish he knew how much his one class affected me. PHYS 5A

Alan Christy and Alice Yang. Their dynamic with HIS 80Y and my fascination with WWII history made the best dynamic I've ever witnessed with a multi professor class. They have so much insight and life experience to share. Relating what you teach back to your life and the lives around you is such an important aspect. They try to be very available to students and their packed schedules with their joy of teaching is a must-have experience. I loved that class. HIS 80Y

Robin Dunkin (only prof that teaches 20B?). She made a huge effort to do interactive learning (which I personally dont enjoy, but love the effort cus it's a lot of work) and made video resources and had in class samples to keep things exciting. All the while, she was pregnant. I appreciate the hell out of that class, and people should definitely sign up to be a survey slug with her. BIOE 20B

Patrick Tantalo. EXTENSION!!! Everyone knows how amazing Tantalo is. He knows coding isnt the easiest thing in the world, and always sets our reasonable expectations for student success. He made one of my worst quarters at UCSC so much more bearable. CS/CSE 12A (back when it was java)

David Draper. A man of no BS and much insight. He has an amazing background and makes something difficult like bayesian statistics more understandable. He tries to get  to know everyone too. He could easily not care about us, but he makes the effort to do so. AMS/STAT 131/206

Terry Terhaar. Thesis writing isnt easy, and I appreciate her help navigating us through how to write and design our entire theses. Always responds to emails and always provides extra help and feedback. BME 123T

Joshua Deutsch. He teaches a multidisciplinary class on how to work together to understand complicated aspects of biophysics from different perspectives. He's made zoom for a complicated topic a joy. PHYS 180

David Bernick. He has amazing insight in life and is a passionate educator in addition to being an experienced researcher and engineer. He tries his best to provide the most unique feedback to students. Always building them up and never breaking them down. I wish I got to take more classes with him. He thinks through almost everything he says before he says it, and has a good sense of humor to keep people upbeat. BME 160

Kevin Karplus. Boy was his 51 series classes difficult, but I can easily say that I've learned the most engineering in my engineering degree from him. He gets a bad rep from people for being tough or unrealistic, but if you know to balance your time well, you can definitely step up to the plate to do well and learn A LOT. He really cares about how much we learn and what's the best way time setup for success/learning. I also appreciate his Bread and Tea meetings on Fridays, and his constant emails on new developments in our field and on campus. He's given more feedback and guidance on things than I can ask for these two years, and I hope he has a happy retirement soon. BME 51AB"
UCSC,fn15agm,t1_fn10pia,1586555077.0,"Take him for 206, and hopefully you guys go to his social office hours. He's very insightful."
UCSC,fn157tt,t1_fn0pfzq,1586555035.0,Overall great guy!
UCSC,fn14ykt,t1_fn0vjig,1586554888.0,"I believe so. Check the academic calendar. There are course refund dates, though I don't know what they are myself this year."
UCSC,fn13w54,t1_fn0yk30,1586554283.0,"^ saying a general phrase ""international travel"" is a blanket term for all international travel. While ""blocking China"" is a part of international travel, ""blocking international travel"" implies blocking many/all other countries.
Chickens are birds, all birds are not chickens. Chickens cant fly and are birds, not all birds cant fly.

Edit: To respond to the original claim of ""not too shabby,"" blocking travel is not enough to control a pandemic allowing any amount of potentially infected people back in to a healthy population, one must guarantee that they can in some way, not contaminate, or at least control the contamination of the healthy population. We had no prepared tests or cures, and allowed people to travel at will. When we did have tests, they were inaccurate with a horrible confidence interval.  

I dont care if it's Trump or not. If it was Obama, Clinton, either Bush, Kennedy, or even FDR, I'd rail them for the way this was handled. 

Also, I should point out, telling people to take hydroxychloroquine is the same as the communist part in China telling people to drink bear bile. Unethical, dangerous, malicious, immoral, uneducated, delusional, and misinformed. Maybe even mal-informed."
UCSC,fn0ytme,t1_fn0uc2u,1586551412.0,"I'm not as interested in our response to international travel. Regardless of it being somewhat later or earlier, it doesnt drastically change the overall approach to dealing with the virus. That is, the hidden/mis-counts of reported cases so that insurance and campaigners can hide the damage to improve their profit/polls, and the lack of preventative measures employed by the states and poor testing (including accuracy of tests, dispersal, production, etc). Theres additional issue in the news reports of only reporting deaths without statistically and accurately representing how many cases and breaking them into relevant age groups and conditions, as well as calling it something similar to the typical flu. One should be optimistic, but no much as to spread false hope and misinformation about how soon we could reopen borders and release sheltering orders. Theres a lot to dig in here, and the overall lack of state and federal leadership, to put simply, is an abomination for lack of proper organization and directives.

I also take issue with the violence and racism but that's not related to the topic of prevention of virus spread.

I link this video [The Pandemic Playbook] (https://youtu.be/Z42G8Wus4kA), regardless of party lines. Pandemics and death should not be a partisan issue, it's humanitarian. 

From how the US handled the issue, 3trillion dollars, is not enough to keep us afloat for very long, and definitely won't tie us over for any round 2."

UCSC,fn02p43,t1_fn017mj,1586534354.0,"We're doing a great job of it. The US is pretty well known for taking something bad and making it worse (in literally any and all fields of study through history). We're like the country at in the friend group that everyone hangs out with cus they have to, knows are hypocritical, and would very much like to have shut the **ck up."
UCSC,fn02a87,t1_fn01869,1586534137.0,"I do too. I miss the times where I was the only one lacking sleep, not the professor too. I'm super grateful for professors adapting and learning about zoom since I assume tech support is hard to get and limited.

I wish I could help more to ease things up with professors, most I can do I'd record in case their own recordings fail. I also miss seeing my friends and meeting new people. 

Hopefully, if the right decisions are made and kept, we can move to in-person instruction by Fall, Winter latest.

On the flipside though, now is a great time to audit classes out of interest :) I'd also recommend taking a lighter course load for people"
UCSC,fn00mnm,t3_fyhvqk,1586533252.0,"Expected and unsurprised. I believe social distancing should be kept well into summer as well honestly. The US has been the worst responder in this pandemic, on a governmental and civilian level since people here seemingly especially like to ""stick it to the man"" for the sake of doing it. We are not close to the peak imho, even though I feel like things are slowing down from the initial infection. Someone/some people, are going to make the rash decision to open up states/cities before manageable/acceptable levels of the virus are down, and we will most likely have a rebound in numbers. Hopefully not; a longer term shutdown would he devastating. This is something the country(ies) needs to correct for and get right the first time."
