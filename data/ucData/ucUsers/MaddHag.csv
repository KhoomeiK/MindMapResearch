scoliosis,fostpi5,t1_fosm67z,1588037844.0,Thanks! I’m in SoCal so we’ve got a huge heatwave but that also means I should be able to find a studio once this is over!

ucr,focm5zg,t3_g5gkuc,1587672974.0,I met my roommate in the Facebook group. would recommend bc we never had issues we couldn’t address and stayed friendly the whole year. Also feels less like you’re moving in with an absolute stranger
ucr,foclu30,t3_g5mmvt,1587672865.0,My advisor was out on medical leave for two weeks but I didn’t know that until I emailed them and I bounced back telling me to email another advisor so I did and then that advisor sent my email to another advisor who emailed me back as if they were the first advisor and just told me to come into their walk in hours and i waited 45 minutes just for him to sign a form
ucr,foclb98,t3_g5snna,1587672684.0,I like honors and I personally feel that the required honors classes aren’t difficult. The honors classes I’ve taken overlap with my breadth requirements. I’ve gotten an A in every honors class because they want you to succeed if you put in the work BC it looks good for them. Priority registration is nice.
