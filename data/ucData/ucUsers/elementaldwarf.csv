If you still don't get an email after this follow-up then maybe I would call it quits."

Content-wise, this class is REALLY heavy. Like if you want to lose faith in humanity or feel broken inside twice a week, this class is for you. If you are not in good mental health, steer far away.

The first quarter was the most work, we had ""required"" readings each week and a short 1-1.5 page paper each of the first five weeks (halfway between summary and analysis) that were pretty easy. I say ""required"" because you could get away with not reading them or skimming them and just speak up once or twice in discussions. Super easy!

The quarters themselves are organized based on themes surrounding three case studies: the Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, and the Indonesia massacres of 1965. The first quarter is providing historical context, lead up to the violence, and the violence itself.  The second quarter is about how the events are remembered, regarding testimonies, memories, memorials, etc. And the last quarter is a seminar of your choosing. There's really cool ones like hunting Nazis after the war and stuff like that.

The final exams (no midterms) are also easy. The professors (who are absolutely fantastic and so damn smart) give a study guide of key terms you have to define, along with three to four essay prompts, of which they pick certain ones to be on the exam. So basically you're given the test beforehand. Highly, highly recommend!

Also Global Islam appears to be a new one. Haven't heard of it before."

On myUCLA, go to top right at the yellow box that says need help, and choose Ask a Question. Click Academic Counseling Unit and type up a message asking for more units and they'll get back to you pretty quickly.

Something to keep in mind: they will only do this if you asking for a 4th class to add. If you want to add a fifth class, you will have to wait until March 30th ;)"
