UCSantaBarbara,fpmsaia,t1_fpms2lv,1588740390.0,exactly what i’m thinking. probably a tough time constraint and harder questions.
UCSantaBarbara,fpkpqnq,t3_gduy3m,1588698901.0,"this sounds really terrible. it makes me cringe when people say things like “this is hard for everyone, not just low income/first gen/etc” because it is drastically harder to succeed right now for people like you.  

the online situation is amplifying the drastic differences in opportunities between students which is something i thought ucsb did a pretty good job (comparatively) at in the past. 

i’m so sorry you have to go through this. i know for a fact your hard work will get you so much further in life and happiness than people that don’t face the adversity you’re going through. keep pushing. there is light at the end of the tunnel. we’re rooting for you."
UCSantaBarbara,fp0qt2h,t1_fp0q4m9,1588214885.0,thank you! how can i find out when/ where the application process starts?
UCSantaBarbara,foz7jfs,t3_gad7tb,1588185991.0,"It depends on your confidence. If you love yourself for who you are, you will easily find a group that appreciates and loves you. If you aren’t confident in yourself and your body, you will constantly feel like people are judging you. In reality, most people are really open here and non-judgmental."

UCSantaBarbara,fowd7lz,t3_g9yf3r,1588117516.0,"in addition to my other comment, i believe if you are from a different UC you must still apply to take a summer session here. not sure if it is just a formality or if they actually review you, but just another thing to think about."
UCSantaBarbara,fowcznx,t3_g9yf3r,1588117393.0,"you have to take 6 units (approx 1.5 classes) during the session to get aid. also, the cost is a standard fee plus the cost for each unit you are taking. there is a cost estimator on the financial aid website. 

to get financial aid, all you have to do is list UCSB as a school on your FAFSA. however, the summer financial aid here is substantially lower than other quarters. :("
UCSantaBarbara,fot420x,t3_g9er5s,1588044173.0,you can research all of this on this subreddit
UCSantaBarbara,fosgj7w,t1_fosg9dg,1588030267.0,"that can happen too, depending on the class policy"
UCSantaBarbara,fos7tzs,t1_forx5m3,1588025545.0,was it african history? /hist49b?
UCSantaBarbara,forplp8,t3_g979up,1588016273.0,if you do any research on the party reputation you will find out it is very academically rigorous and most people don’t party all the time.

UCSantaBarbara,fom8x9m,t1_fom39vk,1587881832.0,it’s not allowed and if they find out you can get dropped by both. have faith in yourself.. if you’ve worked hard in previous econ classes and study your ass off you will have no trouble getting a B in econ 10a.
UCSantaBarbara,fo5htws,t3_g5nukt,1587525996.0,"i’d like to point out that this is the reason econ students are so upset about the no P/NP. 

other people cheating directly impacts your grade, and you can get curved down. yes, other departments haven’t opted in, but for econ, it is especially devastating. 

if everyone cheated, you could get raw score A and still fail because only so many people can pass."
UCSantaBarbara,fo51rcv,t3_g5r6ac,1587515657.0,"because the virus does not discriminate based on nationality. it may have started in china, but the nationality of the person who first got it isn’t an adequate representation of the virus. that’s similar to accusing all chinese of being at fault."

UCSantaBarbara,fnledzz,t3_g26v18,1587052085.0,"the idea is that in the end we all pay around the same because in-state parents have paid extensive taxes over the years for the uc. if in-state students still have to pay heavy taxes for the school, why should out of state get their tuition lowered?

it seems like you have no idea how much of a heavy financial burden taxes can be on californians."
UCSantaBarbara,fn49mkt,t1_fn3yvuv,1586636874.0,i was thinking the same thing. i’m also in the groupme and nothing was said in there. i think kelly’s bluffing.

UCSantaBarbara,fn3xt1e,t1_fn3xk7e,1586630028.0,"no problem. also i forgot to mention your options are 10, 14, 17 or unlimited swipes per week"
UCSantaBarbara,fn3xgij,t1_fn3vo41,1586629830.0,"yeah you can swipe in whenever you want so you can eat as many lunches as you want. meal swipes reset every week, so if you don’t use all of them in that week they don’t carry over."
UCSantaBarbara,fn3ptyj,t1_fn26ryt,1586625567.0,yeah you can eat at any of them
UCSantaBarbara,fn1w574,t3_fyto8o,1586571544.0,"FT is honestly underrated. the ones on campus have a different vibe that is also good. However, if you’re willing to bike 10ish minutes to class, FT has bigger rooms, and the bathroom situation is suite style which is really nice. also, imo portola (dining common at FT) is the best one with the most options. 

it all depends on your preferences."
UCSantaBarbara,fn1hlhe,t1_fn0luuu,1586562178.0,"did you happen to live in FT? i lived there and felt like everyone was in greek life. i also eventually got ditched by the sorority girls :(. 

kinda weird meeting here, but if you want to make a new friend, it sounds like we both could use a new one."
UCSantaBarbara,fmz8ytn,t3_fy9aw8,1586511111.0,on the PulsePoint app it says there was a medical emergency that took 1 hour 10 minutes on 66 el colegio at 10:30pm... hope that’s not related
UCSantaBarbara,fmz8m52,t3_fya9h8,1586510710.0,"I had the exact same experience this year. Joined a club, went out a lot, felt like i had a lot of “friends”, but didn’t find anyone that truly wanted to be a real friend. 

I think part of it was that at the beginning I surrounded myself with sorority type people and they ended up in their sorority groups. Also, not to generalize on greek life, but SOME of the people are pretty fakey. 

I’m hoping next year will turn over a new leaf :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fmis1xf,t1_fmil4dq,1586115758.0,uhhh not the case for me
