functionalprint,fpgxpt6,t1_fpgwnr2,1588611379.0,As far as I know Aldi's is the only grocery store chain in the US with cart dispensers like that
SalsaSnobs,fpbxula,t1_fpbxknv,1588481602.0,"Ha so true, the only ones I've had from them I didn't like just turned out to be too fresh. After mellowing out for a week, boom, excellent.

It was cool seeing on the tour just seeing how little space is back there for their production volume. Like you can tell it's small from the bar space, but watching Tim crawling over the malt bags to try and find some dark malt really warmed by homebrewing in a tiny apparment heart."
SalsaSnobs,fpbx9x4,t3_gcdfql,1588481154.0,"Bay Area salsa & beer hi-five! Looks good, and I love that Nelson Nugs especially. You watch their brewery tour on IG the other night?"

berkeley,fpadpm6,t1_fpa6a6p,1588446029.0,"And nothing has changed in 100 years, I've seen plenty of people with their masks the same way."
mechmarket,fp8uc4w,t3_gblcaj,1588403261.0,"Will the UT47.1 PCB fit in these new cases? One of my two is in the standard acrylic sandwich, it'd be sweet to upgrade it!"
SalsaSnobs,fp577rk,t1_fp48yhx,1588318708.0,"Sounds delicious! Roughly what quanitity did you end up with, think I'm going to do a 1/2 batch tomorrow."
lego,fows84a,t1_fowg343,1588126030.0,Interestingly LEGO uses one of the techniques on slide 24 in the Saturn V [for the tiny LEGO flag](https://imgur.com/9BajEDq). Might be different because it's a smooth plate versus a standard one with studs.
bayarea,fotod82,t3_g9araa,1588060397.0,"And starting after June 1st as of right now, pending approval."
bayarea,fot9x6d,t1_fos8vaw,1588048124.0,"I've got a [whole map of SF and East Bay breweries](https://goo.gl/maps/JUq9mduRpnGgLNds9) and beer bars for your perusal! Pretty much every brewery on there is doing online orders either to-go or shipped, and lots of the bars are doing to-go draft beer.

There are also even more that aren't on there."

battlestations,foes36k,t1_fo8567f,1587712843.0,Depending where you are located a used Herman Miller or similar ergonomic chair can be a great option. I got a used Aeron for $350 and 4 years later it feels like the day I got it.
battlestations,foerllf,t1_fo979m4,1587712377.0,"I'd reccomend a smaller solid wood top and some regular legs from IKEA. You can get a solid wood top and a set of nice looking legs for ~$150. If you don't need the extra storage it's a great setup.

battlestations,foeqlkd,t1_fobj08y,1587711442.0,"Great spot for a sansaveria or maybe a pothos to the left of your lower monitor!

Great setup, what are your PC specs? I see you're running VR, how often do you find yourself using it?"
SalsaSnobs,fodpf2b,t3_g51128,1587687617.0,"Thanks for the recipe, [made some today!](https://imgur.com/CnTwE2j) Didn't have any chile de arbol so used a couple fresh habaneros that I tossed into the frying pan with the dried peppers."
bayarea,fo96om2,t1_fo8owa7,1587611796.0,Next cloudy day we get I'll be sure to make a Turn On Your Headlights post.
MechanicalKeyboards,fo87w5g,t3_g5yfsq,1587591500.0,Is there a good tenkeyless kit I should recommend to my friend looking for his first mech? He knows how to solder and is generally technically inclined.
CannabisExtracts,fnrk6ql,t1_fnre4je,1587191556.0,Not the starting material. I've never personally seen freeze dried bubble like that in a dispensary.
CannabisExtracts,fnrk4oj,t1_fnrexba,1587191502.0,Short answer as far as I know; yes you can do it at a lower temp for a much longer time. I believe a couple weeks is roughly right for something like 110Â°
CannabisExtracts,fnqkzhe,t1_fnqkfi5,1587166708.0,"You can also make diamonds from a butane or ethanol extraction, in which case (short version) you're purging normally, re-disolving in either pentane or ethanol (usually) and crystalizing in that, and then crushing & purging that and then re-disolving in terps that you fractioned off earlier. Then the nice yellow diamonds crystalize in the terps.

CannabisExtracts,fnqjzkb,t1_fnqix3e,1587166132.0,"Ah fair, I was considering it a direct process since if you do pretty much anything with the rosin you're not likely to get good diamond formation. 

I also prefer stuff that's more of a buttery consistency, I agree with all your points about diamonds. I think the diamonds just sell really well. The stuff straight off the press is fire AF."
CannabisExtracts,fnqied5,t1_fnqgexe,1587165227.0,"This is taking a high quality freeze dried bubble hash and turning it directly into sauce. You could probably re-squueze a low quality hash rosin, but it wouldn't yield well probably."
editors,fnlw21s,t3_g2elvu,1587060730.0,"I'd definitely recommend a used Herman Miller. I found an Aeron for $300 from a closing startup, super solid going on 6 years now with it and it still feels like new."
berkeley,fn3ud8k,t3_fz3930,1586628084.0,Last time /u/lulzcakes tried to add a nice pic of campus to the banner there was much complaining.
MechanicalKeyboards,fmr4wrc,t1_fmpuf8x,1586313955.0,[This listing](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32957159275.html) looks much more similar to the Melody96.
CannabisExtracts,fmbnrfu,t1_fmbmscc,1585929917.0,"So you're essentially creating a super saturated pentane solution, and then once pressures added the THC precipitates out of the pentane in large crystals. you then need to boil off the pentane, crush the crystals and purge it a little more to make sure there's no solvent stuck in the crystal structure.

FWIW I worked in the industry selling gasses to extractors, this was how it was explained to me first hand."
