berkeley,fooudwq,t3_g8otf6,1587946664.0,"hi! i am currently in the same situation, my dog got diagnosed with cancer and needs surgery to remove her tumors and no one in my family is working right now, and i started crying because we couldn't afford the surgery, so my vet told me there are credit options to help pay. specifically creditcare, they have a promotion that any costs over $200 you can open an account and pay in payments up to 18 months with no interest (as long as you meet the monthly payments). i hope this helps and that your situation works out for the best :)"
berkeley,foiigjb,t3_g7mwl5,1587787438.0,"honestly during these times a spring admission seems like a blessing! i would say to go to the school that will help you succeed in the long run in terms of internship opportunites, etc, and where you think you'll be happiest, they are both amazing schools :)"
berkeley,foh16ca,t3_g7f5mi,1587759344.0,"personally if i were you i would just go to ucla becuase of the benefits from regents, i was in the same boat as you but opposite where i got regents for berkeley but not for ucla and the main reason i chose berkeley was because of the benefits of regents even though i was highly considering ucla"
