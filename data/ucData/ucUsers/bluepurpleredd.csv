AskWomen,fov49vb,t3_g9kj6z,1588095139.0,"I (25F) have been with my partner (27M) since I was 15, and he was 17. We met in high school and have been dating since. Some of the backlash I faced with my family was that we are both from different cultures and that I was 15. I knew he was a great guy since I met him. I was abused at a young age and I would flinch by the smallest things (like someone touching my arm). He was never pushy or touchy with me and gave me space when I needed it (this without me having to explain what I went through as a child). Which is not how most of the guys in my high school were. 

I knew it was real love for two main reasons: 

1) he was there unconditionally. My sister had to be hospitalized and in a coma for months and he was always there for me and all of my family. He would bring sandwiches and water bottles for all of us. My family loves him because they have saw how much he cares for me and them. 

2) We had both given each other space to grow. Just because one person wants to do something or likes something it doesn’t mean that the other person has to do it or like it as well. I lived away from him for two years due to college. It was tough not seeing each other but we made it work.

Like every couple we have our ups and downs. What has helped us both is talking about the problem after we had both cooled down from being angry or upset. We have been living together now and it’s great. I love him with all my heart and I would not trade him for anything."

askwomenadvice,fmfxwhr,t1_fmfgr6g,1586037148.0,I’m currently using the secret clinical strength stress response (invisible solid). It works well with regular shirts but when I use tank tops thats where I have a problem. But I will try to get a gel and a travel size one
