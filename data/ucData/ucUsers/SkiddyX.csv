UCSantaBarbara,fnpirnx,t3_g343gw,1587146221.0,That's seriously horrible - I feel physically sick reading that. I hope you don't take it personally. The person who wrote that is obviously suffering in someway and taking it out on someone who definitely doesn't deserve it.
afinil,fnebubr,t1_fnebkvh,1586886576.0,I would worry more about taking nearly 400mg of Modafinil daily then the stigma attached to a drug class.
afinil,fneauqc,t3_g18cs1,1586886077.0,"Have you explored other medications for hypersomnia (Vynanse/Adderall)? This sounds difficult to live with.

Personally, I love talking to people while on Modafinil and tend to ramble."
afinil,fneajns,t3_g16urd,1586885923.0,"How is 200mg a fuck ton of coffee? Most coffee drinkers 16oz when they have coffee which is about 200mg. I would be worried about if you are sick or if you have having a reaction to Modafinil.

That being said - you are going to get reduced effects."

MachineLearning,fmwnmco,t3_fxn5lo,1586449788.0,You don't realize how good Lilian is at making notes until you try to take notes on the same topic! :P
MachineLearning,fmnz429,t3_fweypj,1586239703.0,/r/ML is starved for drama. This thread is going to explode.
slatestarcodex,fm88bnt,t3_ftguhj,1585844683.0,"The AI prediction is ridiculous.

> In the case of artificial intelligence, everyone agrees the evidence and arguments are far from watertight, but the question is where does this leave us? Very roughly, my approach is to start with the overall view of the expert community that there is something like a 1 in 2 chance that AI agents capable of outperforming humans in almost every task will be developed in the coming century. And conditional on that happening, we shouldnâ€™t be shocked if these agents that outperform us across the board were to inherit our future.

If history of AI has taught us anything, it's that the expert community  is __horrible__ at predicting progress."
