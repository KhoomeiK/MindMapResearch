Each department has recommendations of what % of each grade to give, and most classes adhere to that.  But those horror stories you hear of professors saying ""70% of you will not pass my class"" are completely unheard of."

berkeley,fpfr6ny,t1_fpf50ah,1588580541.0,"The CARES act gave Cal 34 million dollars, half of which is mandated to go directly to students, leaving them 17 million dollars in federal money.  According to my rough estimates that's not even enough to pay for all the housing refunds they had to send out.  As for your point about campus fees, to some degree I agree with you that we shouldn't be paying those fees if we're not using those facilities.  However, most of that money goes to paying the facilities staff that takes care of those places so that we can use them when in-person school is in session.  It would be pretty crappy to fire potentially thousands of people like that.

On the other hand you can have SARS-2 for 2 weeks, walking around and giving the virus to people, before you get any symptoms of COVID-19.  Also since symptoms are very mild, like the common cold, in some amount of people, those people might go out and spread the disease even further rather than immediately going to the hospital."
