Wow! I saw the webpage and thought it was around 860 or something, is it because of the house? Or I should be expecting to pay around that amount of money per month."

 that's great news!! Thank you for the clarification yeah I just applied right after they announced my EOP status, how is the experience like? Was it hard to adapt as a transfer student? And is it worth the money you are paying each month?"

I do have a driver's license and tax returns, hopefully, I don't struggle too much.

edit: are you open to some more questions? I'm just so Oblivious when it comes to answering some of the final financial forms. I'm guessing your parents (just like mine) don't file w-2's, however, the webpage still asks me for them."
berkeley,fo7q4is,t1_fo7od9j,1587582618.0,"As much as it will ease things for me, my mom has a tourist visa, I cannot just claim her dead because she is already in the system. (sort of) on top of that, I've been using FAFSA back at my local CC so they know she is alive and well.

plus I'm pretty sure that illegal. 

best regards,"
