>""I know I often act like a jerk. But I really want people to think and understand why. If someone doesn't want to get there I'm not going to bother with it, but if you're going to try and put in the effort, I need you to think.""

Just because his style of teaching is something you don't like, does not make him a bad teacher. Maybe he isn't a good fit for you specifically, but this doesn't mean anything when it's subjective. I took Ternansky. Greatest professor in my undergraduate. My Civil Procedures professor in law school taught in a very similar style to Ternansky, and almost every student in the class came out of it thinking how great of a professor he was. 

>they would instead evaluate their own flaws in teaching if the class was not understanding a concept.

You realize that not every time a class doesn't understand a concept means that the teacher did something wrong right? It's not always the teacher's fault. It CAN be the laziness of students. If a specific student does have a simple question, better to ask him after class or at office hours to catch up. That's the point of lecture time, to progress in the material. Not for students who might be behind to try to catch up and stall the class."
UCSD,fp2w8i4,t1_fp1lhla,1588268928.0,"He's a great professor. Not everyone enjoys the time with him because his teaching style isn't suited for everyone, but what professor's style is? He's the best professor I've ever had in my entire undergrad, and top 3 professors of all time for me. His style is really about guiding you to the correct answer utilizing the theoretical principles you learned in gen chem to connect them to the concepts you need in ochem. He prioritizes fundamental understanding over pure memorization which is exactly the way you need to learn ochem to achieve a good score. That comes with it's downsides, because of his need to (sometimes forcefully) guide you to the correct concept. 

In memorization classes where it's a regurgitation of the material, all you really need to do is sit at home and memorize all the things over and over again. If that were the case, teachers just need to post a powerpoint or word doc of all the terms you need to memorize and call it a day. Ternansky has one of the hardest classes because his material is intrinsically difficult. 

Ultimately, you take out of the class what you want. If you really want to learn ochem and get good at ochem, he's probably the best prof you'll find. If you just want to coast through it and not really care, you're gonna have a bad time."

teamliquid,fovql2f,t1_fov914w,1588105815.0,"I truly believe that what the biggest issue with NA is not the talent in the player pool but coaching. Traditional sports teams with really solid coaching staffs that can adapt and know how to coach are so fundamentally important to a team. We look at coaches like Gregg Popovich with the Spurs and Nick Nurse with the Raptors right now that have things really figured out to adjust their systems and play with the tools given. 

There's a reason C9 actually has had success at worlds relative to NA teams regardless of the ""luck"" factors some people want to attribute to their runs. Reapered is the GOAT NA coach and it's not even close. If NA teams had to choose between upgrading a player or upgrading their coach, 99/100 times I would say they need to look into their coaching staff. A good coach can elevate everyone, turn role players into stars, etc. One good player isn't really going to have the same effect. 

Hope Steve picked out someone good."

What if I suddenly go on a sick 15 game win streak and promoted from like silver 1 to plat 4 (not even sure how many games it would take but let's just assume it as an estimate). Would riot know I'm a smurf?

How about if a challenger top laner decides he/she wants to have other accounts for all their other roles. Clearly, if youre in challenger you're going to at least around plat with your other roles, but probably closer to mid-high diamond. When you make those new accounts, are those smurfs too? If no, how does Riot tell the difference, do they have to go through each ""smurf"" account and examine them 1 by 1? If yes, are you going to prohibit players from making other accounts for other roles and force them to roleswap on their main and ruin those games in challenger when trying to play ADC? 

Obviously, these 2nd accounts aren't being used in that manner because Tyler1's recent swap to jungle where he used a fresh account to get up to masters/high diamond. But what if that was the case and streamers decided to actually start doing that? There's a gray area there and the only way to really enforce something is to look at each account 1 by 1 and idk if Riot is willing to expend the resources on it especially when they as a company want more views on their game.

It is like you said, purely in terms of economy, a vulture is 25 more minerals than a drone, but the drone is also losing that potential mining time that adds in over time. The earlier the drones die, the more potential minerals lost. 

Further, FlaSh is also doing a multitude of other things, like keeping Soma from ever really moving out for a substantial attack, scouting, and forcing mediocre units from Soma. Soma doesn't really want to be making hydras in that situation, he wants to make drones. Forcing vultures through means Soma needs to continue to commit to building some units to hold off the vultures, meaning if FlaSh can get 1 drone snipe he's also forced Soma to make less workers and more units to defend."

teamliquid,fnmky5u,t1_fnmizqo,1587073303.0,"I don't exactly see what is ""flaming"" the team in most of these. 

In your first article, he criticizes the coaching staff for their suspect benching and roster decisions. He literally implies he should've been benched longer when Tactical was playing well. He also expected a warning from the team before benching, which is usually how coaching works. That's not flaming, those are valid points. 

idek what the 2nd link is supposed to be. He says that they try harded and that the team still lost. It doesn't sound like for a moment that he was flaming his team or coaching staff, that the whole team needs to improve. And who can blame what he says? The team finished 9th, is it wrong to say that they're doing something wrong when they're losing?

Your 3rd link is literally Double bashing himself for being demotivated and not performing well and agreeing with his coaches when they spoke to him. What was the point of this???

Your 4th link is fair, he's ""flaming"" the coaches and team's decision to ban him from playing senna and he feels insulted by it. Sure, you could call that flaming. 

Your 5th link is debatable. From my view, he is explaining to a viewer why their shitty communication causes the team to be passive. That is his viewpoint of the situation, and objectively that can be measured by how the team communicates. His explanation is logical, and it makes sense. I suppose someone else might see it where Doublelift is blaming the rest of his team, and not himself, on lack of communication. Which could be a fair point if you wanted to see it, but I guess we have to agree to disagree here. I don't see this as flaming. 

Last article, don't exactly see where he's flaming.

teamliquid,fnm0vrt,t1_fnlz82v,1587063139.0,"I feel like Doublelift has had an issue with coaching, not with the team. And to be fair, most of the problems with TL definitely are in their coaching staff/drafting. Coaches are authority, good coaches are able to right the ship and tell their players how to perform. Reapered as a prime example for how he always can command a team's respect."
teamliquid,fnlxxrq,t1_fnlxqas,1587061668.0,"That's speculation for now, and it certainly could be true. We don't know right now."
teamliquid,fnlxvj1,t1_fnlxdd2,1587061637.0,Isn't that what he's doing with putting the contract up though? Holding DL hostage would be him not allowing DL to pursue any other deals or teams to discuss a buyout/trade.

LivestreamFail,fnlwgv0,t1_fnlhcb3,1587060935.0,Hail the new video.
leagueoflegends,fnlw6bt,t1_fnltoa1,1587060789.0,I don't think he'll retire until he makes it out of groups at worlds.
leagueoflegends,fnlw3ip,t1_fnlsysx,1587060750.0,"Tactical but on a long shot, Sneaky. But I think Sneaky is either faithful to C9 or not interested in rejoining. I don't follow Sneaky so I could be wrong about the latter. Tactical looked fine in his games, nothing outstanding, but definitely has room to grow into a high quality LCS adc."
leagueoflegends,fnlvrlo,t1_fnltmws,1587060586.0,I think that one of the draws is to reunite Biolift lane even as much as Core is a better player than Bio
