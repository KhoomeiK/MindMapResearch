I’m a girl who transferred into EECS 2 semesters ago and I’ve actually met some pretty chill and respectful EECS men, but they have all been transfers except for one.
Also another thing I would definitely recommend is checking out FemTech! There are a bunch of girls who are awesome and they have activities to connect people in their classes as well as tutoring. :)"
berkeley,fm05pvl,t3_fs7wku,1585645761.0,Everyone I have talked to is feeling this exact way. It’s been really tough to feel motivated when I’m just not used to this way of studying and the pressure feels like it’s always on.
