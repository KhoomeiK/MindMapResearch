premed,fpe93wl,t3_gcyhzj,1588542822.0,"Wtf that’s embarrassing. There was one time I was in my ochem discussion for a group assignment and this premed student (who happens to be in the same intern program as me) claimed that “clinical hours and patient care isn’t important right now because we basically do “nurse” work as interns and we’ll get clinical exposure once we enter med school.” He further goes on saying, “if we get clinical exposure, it’s better to get it from shadowing.” I was about to stop him right there cause 1) he disrespected nurses 2) he claims that clinical hours isn’t important for premeds until med school and 3) he only thinks shadowing is the only way for premeds. Everything he said was extremely ignorant and offensive because I have family members who are nurses, and it’s extremely disrespectful to view them less from a physician. Plus, the purpose of clinical exposure is to see if you REALLY enjoy medicine."
UCSD,fpe2qd2,t3_gcxq7f,1588539181.0,"Only your federal/state grants will be kept the same. UCSD can not touch that, but your UCSD grant in aid is a university aid, so that can be taken away. This exactly happened to me when I got refunded. My cal grant stayed the same, but I didn’t get back my UCSD grant in aid."
UCSD,fp4czx5,t3_gb88qn,1588296427.0,First pass begins May 15th
UCSD,fp0ffhy,t3_galfvc,1588208219.0,"I think this is a good balance of stem and non-stem courses. Chem and physics will be a hard balance, but it’s honestly better than taking physics with ochem. I’m currently taking both ochem and physics and I honestly hate it. I think you’ll be in good shape with these amount of courses. It looks pretty doable."
UCSD,fok4rkf,t3_g7xbcw,1587835394.0,Me!! bomb that part so hard. Wouldn’t be surprised if I got most of them wrong lol
UCSD,fohpnfc,t1_fohkwe1,1587770219.0,All my course I must take has to be at UCSD unfortunately. So my only option is to get a good financial aid package :(
premed,fohjrhg,t1_fohjb1k,1587767126.0,Is it alright if you can pm me your stats and what schools you applied too? Much appreciated!
UCSD,fohjkqn,t1_fohiwl7,1587767035.0,Thanks! How much loans did they give you? Is it worth to take out?
premed,fogz0rp,t3_g7eqoz,1587758613.0,holy!! 7 A’s!! Congrats future doctor!
premed,fo9quhc,t1_fo9qkde,1587627979.0,"Okay, I hope that’s his only intention lol"
premed,fo9pbwd,t1_fo9ol5b,1587626524.0,"Well...writing it in your personal statement, having a PI write an recommendation, or maybe discussing it in an interview will definitely prove it. If you can show to them that you committed a lot of devoted hours into your research, whatever that’s 250 or 1000 etc, that’s a good indication you enjoy research. It’s more about what have you done that makes you love research. It’s not always entirely just the “hours.” Some colleagues of mine do research with lots of hours, but don’t have much on their plate to say about."
premed,fo9o9le,t1_fo9o27b,1587625536.0,"Meaning that you devote and commit a lot of your time doing research and med schools see that you’re passionate it in. Publications will definitely impress them, but it’s all about the quality. They don’t want applicants who just dip their toes and that’s it."
premed,fo9nv46,t3_g6hz46,1587625164.0,"From what i heard, there are lot of applicants who got into top tier research med schools without any publications. I think having quality experience working in the research is good enough, and I don’t think getting no publications will hurt you."
premed,fo5thnm,t3_g5vo86,1587535181.0,"As long as you have one year of biology and lab, you should be fine regardless if it’s lower or upper division course."
UCSD,fo0gv9r,t3_g4z0s2,1587412900.0,I feel like classes barely started tf
UCSD,fo0gmep,t1_fo0629a,1587412774.0,Oh that’s right! Ah finally lol
UCSD,fnzxhv0,t3_g4qrzi,1587402449.0,"ERC has one of the nicest dorms and environment imo. The only con is that it’s the furthest away from the center of campus, but it’s also the quietest and peaceful area I think. We have a really awesome view of the beach and sunset, which is really nice if you ever need to take a walk or step outside. Our GEs is a lot, but definitely not tough. MMW is a pain since it’s five course long, but I wouldn’t say it’s hard. It’s just a lot of work and reading. Plan accordingly with your GEs and major requirement. I cannot stress how important this is. Message me if you have any more concerns!"
premed,fnxjlpw,t3_g4htda,1587339995.0,"I love this doctor! Been following him on instagram, such a cool guy. We need more people like him in this world."
UCSD,fnthkpu,t3_g3tqx2,1587241801.0,"I think hw chp 17-20 are graded, but the 13CNMR is ungraded. In terms of his hw grading policy, i’m still confused but all i know is that if you score 90% and above overall, you’ll earn the total points for the hw category."
UCSD,fnq5d1l,t1_fnq3jt7,1587157988.0,"Then go for it! I didn’t even say anything about mcwp, i’m not in that writing course lol. Do whatever is best for you."
UCSD,fnpxtwh,t3_g37zv3,1587153962.0,"To be safe and have a vary of med schools to apply, i’m taking all my courses for a letter grade cause if some med schools don’t accept them, i worry that my variety of med schools will be narrowed down."
UCSD,fnpwo3w,t1_fnpvm04,1587153361.0,"Actually it depends. Some med schools require intensive writing classes (which is mostly your GE writing course) so, it can count. It’s may not be towards your field of study, but some med school require you to take your writing class as a letter grade. Plus, med school looks at your cumulative GPA, science GPA and non science GPA."
UCSD,fnnylo0,t3_g2whlw,1587105862.0,"I’m on the same boat with you. I had my whole summer plan to work down in SD in research, get more clinical hours, while taking some summer courses, but looks like it’s not happening. My best hope is that this virus slows down over the summer and maybe we’re able to go back to a somewhat “normal” life, but time will tell. I would be really bumped out if this quarantine and remote learning extends to fall quarter. I organized my years exactly how I wanted with everything coordinated as planned. My biggest concern is that if we’re stuck being quarantine for who knows how long, I may have to take an extra gap year just to catch up with everything :("
UCSD,fnlqh3n,t3_g2hlt1,1587057968.0,"Everything is quite a grey area. Some med schools, I think all California med schools, will accept students taking p/np without any prejudice; however, other med schools only accepts p/np IF that’s the only grading option for spring. So basically, some med schools won’t accept p/np if your school gave you the option to take it p/np or letter grade. To be safe, it is highly recommended to take it as a letter grade."
UCSD,fnlq0gt,t3_g2ifm6,1587057744.0,Definitely not! You should drop one of your psyc class. Five weeks is incredibly fast!
UCSD,fnj8tat,t1_fnit78f,1586994155.0,Ah thank you!!
UCSD,fne2fz0,t3_g18okx,1586881875.0,It’s on the calendar. It’s almost near the bottom. The deadline to drop without a W is on 5/1 Week 5.
UCSD,fncxjvs,t3_g119bw,1586850717.0,You should make a four year plan to see if taking that class next quarter might push you behind or not. Helped me a lot.
UCSD,fnc6nub,t1_fnc172v,1586829758.0,"For your first question, i’m not sure. Regarding to paying it, I would wait it out since I don’t have the money to pay for it. My bank account is sad right now. I’m going to contact financial aid or HDH about it tomorrow."
UCSD,fnc0wrq,t3_g0vrjy,1586826297.0,"This is exactly the same problem I have too! I’m not sure why is it like that, but I read somewhere that it’s totally fine and it might be some process in the system to get your refund back."
UCSD,fn4ac6n,t1_fn47v9n,1586637290.0,"Oh okay. I did the same thing, except I paid my spring quarter after I submit my confirmation to  move out. Not sure what’s going on with my statement right now. I don’t if it’s worth it call financial aid or HDH since they are either closed or never respond back via email."
UCSD,fn44uhn,t1_fn4483f,1586634088.0,"Before you got your refund, did you get a temporarily balance on Tritonlink saying you’re charged for the UCSD grant?"
UCSD,fn3z0pq,t3_fzcq0b,1586630724.0,"Nope! Same here. Haven’t received any refunds nor did my balance got fixed. For some reason I’m charged for the UCSD grant they gave me?? Idk, maybe it’s some glitch they haven’t manually fixed. I need my refund back. I understand this covid-19 is slowing things down, but it has been three weeks already. At least give us weekly updates where everything is at for students who hasn’t received back their refunds  :("
UCSD,fn0r4m7,t3_fym0wb,1586547160.0,I think summer session enrollment begins Monday April 13th
UCSD,fmqcjr3,t3_fwtowd,1586297065.0,"It’s too far to predict what’s going to happen in fall quarter. I would predict that if the entire summer session is virtually online, there’s a likely that fall quarter might fall in, but again, it’s too far to know :("
UCSD,fmf5ni4,t3_fuwrha,1586020428.0,I feel you. 2/3 of my professors are just editing their previous quarter podcasts and calling that “lecture.” I tried following along but I get easily distracted and I feel like it’s not stimulating. I’ve been watching youtube videos to understand the material. Waste of tuition money. :(
