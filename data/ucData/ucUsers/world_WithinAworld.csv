I think EA definitely does some scripting to keep you engaged. I only olay online seasons, and it is very hard to maintain a winning streak on 20. And then when Im saving myself from relegation or trying to get a promotion (last remaining game of the season), my shots will just not go in in the first half. And more than half the time opponent scores, but all of a sudden my team gets a massive boost in the last 20 min and i get a dramatic win. 

It’s all about engaging the players, I reckon they earn more money from players’ online gametime. Not sure tho."

But if you think a bit about it, it’s not money and power/control for the sake of some psychological power play. It’s just a directional growth of society. Societal dynamics are bound to change, and there is no logical equilibrium if you believe in evolution, so it makes sense to choose a specific development which ultimately betters the world. Randomization means exponential chaotic growth in the sub societies. Now most of these “nut jobs” give off the impression that they believe that the intent behind everything is something incredibly sinister, but i don’t think thats the case. It is simple assurance of the existence of a civilization. A single human cannot live for long if they don’t have some basic expectations and goals, and i think it is pretty sensible to generalize this to the world population as a singular entity.
