UCSC,foyfs3z,t3_ga9hr5,1588171731.0,"That's lame. 

People need to get a grip on reality, vandalism doesn't make you a hero, it makes you a criminal. Especially when you do nothing but hurt your fellow students."

UCSC,fojezw1,t3_g7huvo,1587818989.0,Amazing work!
UCSC,foeco4z,t3_flb0n2,1587700662.0,"As a transfer student if I'm not mistaken we can't apply for on campus housing yet right? 

In any event if anyone has room for an apartment group, I'm a 25 year old incoming transfer in the college of engineering. I don't make much noise, keep my living space clean, and probably won't give you too much trouble."
UCSC,fodpanq,t3_g6ui9i,1587687550.0,"So if I'm reading this right (incoming transfer student) if the campus goes remote, the on campus houses will always be closed? If I knew that I wouldn't of paid the 150"
