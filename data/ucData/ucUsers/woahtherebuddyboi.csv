Everyone constantly losing sleep over assignments, physical and mental health suffering, etc. I'd say the only way you actually come out as the bad guy in this is if your meddling starts hurting his grades/impacting his future. You can't ask him to sacrifice his goals, or he'll look back and blame you even though you're just taking care of him.

What worked for me was working between classes/during lunch. For smaller assignments, doing them during class. If I needed extra studying time, I took the bus. Especially when I was on season (fall sports), I had to make use of every minute of every day to grab a little extra sleep. I also used weekends to get ahead. All the homework for a math unit was assigned at the start of the unit, so as soon as we started I'd learn from the examples in the textbook and take a weekend to knock off all of that unit's homework. This also meant I could use math class time to do other homework that wasn't assigned in advance, since I already had a basic understanding of what was going on.

Honestly, if that's not going to work for your son and 7 hours of sleep is a dealbreaker for you, you're going to need to see what you can do to get him to a different high school. If he wants to succeed so badly that he's willing to prioritize his school over the rest of his life, then you should try to give him the opportunity to excel."

AmItheAsshole,fnb04lm,t1_fnazkgd,1586806900.0,"Where in the original post did it say that? OP only stepped in to defend D (who is 10 years old and didn't deserve to be yelled at). R escalated it to an argument, and OP retaliated. It would be disciplining if OP tried to make it a punishment, like ""no more games until after dinner"" or something, but this was a one time thing in the middle of an argument. There was no statement like ""your actions have consequences"" or anything like that. It was a reaction to being treated badly and witnessing a younger sibling being treated badly."
AmItheAsshole,fnazglp,t1_fn8v6hb,1586806563.0,"if you think they're both wrong then the correct vote is E S H. I'd go with justified asshole or even NTA though, bc OP wasn't ""disciplining"" him, he was standing up for the younger brother and himself after repeatedly being treated badly.

TrueOffMyChest,fn01f4r,t3_fy3w9m,1586533676.0,"Our ancestors rioted not JUST because of the tax but because they were not represented in the government taxing them. Trump's tax cut reduced taxes on the wealthy and on luxury items. Interestingly, those same politicians tend to be wealthier and own those luxury items. Theyvgave themselves a tax break. It was funded by decreasing assistance for the poor. The weakest and most vulnerable are left with nothing. 

In America, money decides elections. The poor are under represented, but if they started a riot like our ancestors did, would you support them?

How does Trump's tax cut hold anyone accountable? If you want to hold people accountable, by all means do it. But don't pretend Trump is any more accountable than the rest of them, when in fact he is less."
