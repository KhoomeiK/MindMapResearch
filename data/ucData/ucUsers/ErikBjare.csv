Lund,fpaciz5,t3_gc8uuo,1588445323.0,"Hey this could be a nice idea. There are already Discord channels for two organizations at LTH:

 - [X-lab - Makerspace at LU](https://discord.gg/ehfmm4)
 - [Code@LTH](https://discord.gg/bHcGVq)

Invite links expire in a day, DM to get a link after that (anti-spam measure)."
Syncthing,fp5sbmm,t3_gbhb8n,1588338763.0,">On android, say the device has 32 or 64GB sd memory available, and a server has say 8TB, can the android app only let any other apps browse the files without ""syncing"" them, unless wanted?

Unfortunately not. 

>Can the syncthing android app only ""mount"" the remote storage?

Yes, it only syncs whole directories and does not allow for browsing, although it might be possible to build."
Python,foyodbn,t3_ga7y7f,1588176166.0,"What a coincidence, [I wrote the PR](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/pull/191) that added the `current_user_playing_track` method to spotipy! Really nice to see my small contribution in use!

I wrote it when I was working on [aw-watcher-spotify](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-spotify), a small script which tracks what you listen to on Spotify and stores it with [ActivityWatch](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch). I did not imagine it could be used for stuff like this!"

Can't comment on their product, but I'm pretty skeptical of tDCS in general, so there's that."
cardano,fohg570,t1_foh1bpm,1587765403.0,BTC and Ethereum has pretty different processes though. And it's not like Vitalik calls the shots on what will be merged.
nomie,fohae4h,t1_foh2q9u,1587762679.0,Is the internal data UTC though? Or does it store timezone info?
nomie,fo9n6rn,t3_g6g5ex,1587624557.0,"I don't know how Nomie works, but I would assume that it stores all times in UTC (without timezone, this is probably what you have in your exports if you look at the timestamps) and then simply displays the times in your current timezone. This is how we built it in https://activitywatch.net, and I expect our approach to be pretty standard."

ethfinance,fnwfzxh,t1_fnvjb3p,1587317666.0,"The lawsuit doesn't change anything. It's in the hands of MakerDAO governance, who [voted in favor of some sort of refund](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwfvvguaf8rz8xwgv2cqnzzt9t5h6epzh17qmk2ue99y4). The UI for claiming the refund is likely to have legal terms, including a clause about requiring user to not take any further legal action, so if passed may resolve the lawsuit, and everyone would be happy.

Future governance polls are already in the works on the forum, including if the refund should be in ETH or DAI (valued at liquidation)."

YangForPresidentHQ,fmtqt4a,t1_fmtnm2i,1586377401.0,"Holy shit, that's crazy. In Sweden we've gotten rid of our previous inheritance tax in a way that you don't have to pay capital gains for inheritance, but I think the estate also inherits the cost basis. 

From what I've heard we basically got rid of it because of IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, whose estate would otherwise have had to sell a *lot* of shares to pay for the inheritance tax."
YangForPresidentHQ,fmt9ek8,t1_fms1j8k,1586368975.0,"Huh, works differently in Sweden. We have taxation at ""avyttring"" (which is basically any liquidity event or transferral, it basically means ""disowned"" )."
