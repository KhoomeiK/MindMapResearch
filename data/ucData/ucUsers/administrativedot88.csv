When I'm talking about offroading, I mean going to campsites and trails that have muddy/sandy roads where you might actually need a locking diff to not get stuck in a deep puddle of mud. Not rock climbing or hopping over sand dunes.

I only have 1 parking spot at my apartment and the car I buy has to make it 25 miles to work every morning. And I don't want it to be a fucking deathtrap. Not all of us have the luxury to own more than one vehicle."

If I'm going out into the woods, I care much less about dings and scratches on a $40k vehicle than a $120k one. If I roll the thing, a $40k loss is one I'll be very very unhappy about, but a $120k loss will literally wipe out my savings.

That being said, I'm looking at GX460s now, because I realized a $40k RR is a POS that won't start half the time apparently."

cars,fpfunft,t1_fpfreec,1588584147.0,"Sounds like he had a blast though? The only thing actually important that failed was the steering, and even then it wasn't catastrophic. 

I'm specifically looking to buy the Range Rover through CarMax so if it breaks, they'll fix it on the house. I'm mostly worried that CarMax caught on after DeMuro took them for a ride and now their bumper to bumper warranties aren't as good.

I'm not financing this car. I have enough cash saved up to buy the car outright and make more than enough money to keep the car well maintained.

I'm not worried about depreciation. If the car ends up being worth a cheeseburger and a can of soda in 4 years, I don't care. I'll consider my $50k well spent if it meant I got to drive a very nice vehicle for 4 years with relative peace of mind."

I'm not really concerned unless Ranges have a tendency to grenade their powertrain when on the road, in which case that would that would absolutely convince me to not buy one."

Affording the car isn't a problem. I understand this isn't the financially smartest move, but I really don't think I'll have any trouble affording the car. The vehicle would be less than a third of my annual salary and I'm gonna keep it for the good part of a decade.

I'm simply concerned about Carmax's extended coverage on the vehicle, since I do want to be able to show up to work every day and not have to Uber to work for months at a time."
berkeley,foqm6jz,t1_fooazc0,1587996570.0,"""bash post"" OP here. I'm also what you would call an academia nerd too.

Full context, I was also a high-achieving high school and did well in school. But these Bay Area kids all seem to live in this insane bubble. I've met people from Cupertino who didn't know who the Sharks were. Like the fuck? I'm sure they wouldn't be aware of the GSW if they didn't win all the time. I get that hockey isn't big out here but still. You can be high achieving in school but have hobbies that aren't league/melee/anime/NBA jfc. Those seem to be the only four things that smart kids from the bay are into, which imo is bullshit. None of them are individually bad, but only meeting people with these hobbies gets boring reaaaaally fast. I'm not from the area, and back home, even the smart kids have hobbies that don't involve a keyboard or controller. Like my best friend from HS had better grades than me but still spent his weekends working on old Datsuns with his brother.

Hockey is one of my hobbies and I'm convinced half the EECS majors I've met aren't even aware it's a nationally syndicated sport. It's like they've never seen mainstream TV in their life.

I'm not sure I agree with your assessment HKN and research. I was an HKN candidate for a semester, and the vibes I got weren't very chill. The people there seemed way too into recruiting and this cringe nerdiness that I didn't get. They also acted like they were super smart, which might be true, but i found it weird.

Abbeel and Levine also run labs with some bad offenders too. In general, the closer you are to ML the worse the people get. Systems and architecture tend to be much more chill.

The most humble people I've met int EECS imo have been the people doing EE. The hardcore circuits nerds hanging out in supernode all day are super cool and love talking about what they're working on. I think this is because if you're an EECS major but do EE, you have to love it. You have to run the EECS admissions gauntlet, but at the end of all of it, decide to forgo a 300k salary and all the SV benefits to sit in a basement in Dallas designing microwave circuits for peanuts because TI is the only big employer in the industry."
berkeley,foqkl6r,t1_fop5ijk,1587995625.0,"""bash post"" OP here. I'm one of you LOL. I would be coding even if it were a shit job. I've been doing it since I was 11, long before it was any cool and made the money it does today.

When I mentioned nerdy and high achieving, I was specifically singling out the people who didn't give about CS and are only in it for the hype and money. It's the people who tried in school so they had the best shot at being a doctor or lawyer, but get to Berkeley and realize CS is an even easier cash cow that's somehow even cooler. And they get into a dick measuring contest like how Haas people compare Goldman to JP Morgan all fucking day even thought they're just glorified accountants.

And it makes me a little bitter because while the rest of us are working on uncool things for fun, these other bozos are devaluing what we do by listing ""personal projects"" on their CVs which are a couple lines of copied TF code.

In my experience, people who are actually into EECS are few and far between."

Senior engineers at apple don't break 300k even with stock.

[https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Apple-Principal-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E1138\_D\_KO6,33.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Apple-Principal-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E1138_D_KO6,33.htm)

Principals at Apple barely break 300k after stock. I would consider anything higher than principal to be management.

Obviously Apple doesn't pay the highest in the industry, but it's a darn good placement. Aside from FAANG, you're probably not making this money. That's why I said tech flatlines at 300k. It't the highest you can expect to earn if you're not in management, even at a big company. If you end up at some shop like Oracle or Workday, which even then isn't a bad placement, only a mediocre one, you're not even close to seeing this kind of money.

However, Joe Schmuck who went to Southeast Alabama Med can still expect to make 150-200k as an early career doctor. Mediocre software people make like 85k on a good day."
berkeley,fop81d1,t1_fop2o0a,1587955157.0,"Not really, tech flatlines at like 300k unless you're starting your own company. Basically no engineers make more than 300k unless you're in management.

For doctors/lawyers though, the sky's basically the limit. You work for yourself. As an engineer, most of the time you're management's bitch."

berkeley,foos8zq,t1_foobyl2,1587945373.0,"Keep your chin up.

You can study CS without being subscribed to the whole silicon valley circlejerk. This might mean it's a little harder to make friends and find a study group, but it's definitely doable. Just don't join any of the ML or software consulting clubs to dodge this circlejerk. As many other people have said, make your CS friends through other things and they'll be way less anti-social.

Although this does beg the question of what you're gonna do when you graduate. Because if you do study CS and you end up a SWE, odds are you're gonna be surrounded with socially inept people. The comic strip Dilbert is modeled on the bullshit politics that goes on in an engineering firm and is pretty accurate to be honest. So you gotta make the person call to decide if this is something you're okay with.

I know nothing about being a therapist though, so I can't tell you anything about that."
berkeley,fonjpp6,t1_fonc0ri,1587920801.0,"Legit the reason is because EECS is filled with high school valedictorians from well-off high schools who want to make a shitton of money. They all think they're hot shit (for good reason tbh). It's a race to the bottom, because none of these kids were cool in high school, so now that they're finally away from tiger mom, they want to start banging chicks but have no clue where to even start.

And no, that's what makes this school's spirit so great. If you're gonna be the next savant to come up with the next genius sorting algorithm, who gives a shit how many pandas you saved or african kids you fed? Obviously it affects school culture, but I think this is actually kind of treated like a badge of honor here; that the school only cares about raw technical talent and not how much ass you can kiss.

Berkeley's the midnight hacker Woz to the cool Steve Jobs. Quite literally, since Woz is one of our more notable alums."
berkeley,fonighv,t3_g8bhkk,1587920119.0,"We don't have a real cogsci department, but it's counteracted by an extremely strong EECS department.

>To be clear, I am NOT trying to get into the industrial/tech Artificial Intelligence world of developing consumer or manufacturing end optimization ML algorithms.

This is a very misguided view of what the EECS department here does. This is what ML engineers do, but EECS research is extremely theoretical. Our most famous AI professor is Michael Jordan, if you want to look the work does. Some professors in EECS work on the theory of language modeling (Dan Klein) and others do work on mathematically interesting inference problems (Martin Wainwright).

>I am interested, almost exclusively, in the research and development of sentient AI algorithms and associated theoretical architecture.

We're so far from this that you can't dismiss anything slightly applied as uninteresting. It's not like the people at UCSD are doing anything that high-level either. PGBovine, one of their  cogsci professors, is best known for making a python debugging tool for crying out loud. Browsing through their faculty, nobody's doing anything related to sentience or extreme theory. If you want to stay pure, you should be looking at CS departments. Cogsci is more applied than CS when it comes to modeling computation architectures and AI algorithms. ""Computer"" in CS refers to more than just silicon. Turing machines and computability theory are closer to what you're describing than anything anyone in cogsci is doing.

Luckily, if you commit to Berkeley, you can still do computer science. Everyone comes into L&S undeclared, so you're on equal footing."
berkeley,fonefbo,t1_fondt16,1587917906.0,"But the MCB declaration requirement is a 2.0. And isn't it in Berkeley's best interest too to have the most people get into med school? It's not like they have too many premeds, or else they would have raised the bar for MCB declaration."
berkeley,foncyza,t1_fomhjau,1587917092.0,">Really wish there were more genuine, chill, and down to earth people.

Chill people have a tendency to not end up in EECS. Chill people don't wanna do 3 coffee chats, 2 hackerranks and 2 days of interviews to land a summer gig. Chill people don't wanna start recruiting for a fucking internship literally a year in advance. Chill people see more to life than grinding leetcode hards.

There's the rare bird who legitimately likes computers and would be programming them even at $15 an hour, but 98%+ of the people in EECS are just nerds who think they're good at math and puzzles chasing money. They have no particular affinity towards computers.

Part of the problem with the creepy dudes in EECS is that all these nerds in high school come to college and suddenly feel empowered because their skills pull in mad $$$. But what they don't realize is that having $$$ and working a job with ""AI"" in the title might impress a recruiter or your aunt, it sure as hell isn't impressing a girl (unless they're a gold digger, but imo gold diggers don't even want tech people, they want doctors/lawyers). These people who have been deemed ""uncool"" their whole lives suddenly feel like they can be cool, but of course they take it way too far and start being creeps by hitting on their lab partners."

If so, obviously this isn't optimal, but you could take that last class during the summer if it doesn't work out. You would graduate in August, but you would still be able to do grad school. I would sign up now though, because classes fill up. You can pay the fee to enroll now, and drop the first week. It's a 300 dollar paperwork fee, but that's peanuts compared to being held back a year."
