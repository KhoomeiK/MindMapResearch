EarthPorn,fph7qcs,t3_gdgtt0,1588616446.0,"After getting into a car accident early october and miraculously not getting injured, I decided to take a week off my life in California and fulfill my bucket list item of exploring waterfalls in Oregon. After getting rained on non-stop for the first three days (which I honestly didnâ€™t hate, the sounds and smells of a rainy forest have got to be one of my favorite thingsâ€¦), I followed a localâ€™s tip to reach Lemolo Falls through a secret trail that involved miles of dirt roads. As I hiked down the couple miles to the bottom of a canyon, the sun was just starting to peak through and the view on this 165 foot tall waterfall was simply breathtaking. Didnâ€™t see a single person for hours and I will cherish this day forever.

TalkTherapy,fp6n30q,t3_gbm3ze,1588355167.0,"It's interesting because you're very much aware of the purpose of your therapist moving a different direction to help more people and that it has nothing to do with you, yet you try and convince yourself you're to blame. If you got promoted and had to move to another city, would you expect your therapist to be unhappy about losing a client, or just rejoicing about your personal growth (obviously it's different as you're the one struggling, but i'm thinking at a human level)? 

It's definitely going to be a grieving process but I would focus on the thought that this is potentially saving other people's life and that it's not about your abandonment but their own life path. If all fails I truly believe things happen for a reason and who knows, maybe your next therapist will help you make breakthroughs you never would've imagined!"

I agree itâ€™s definitely not professional but it just looks like sheâ€™s trying to keep her life together through a personal crisis and not let anybody down. It truly breaks my heart and I hope she can figure herself out and realize sheâ€™s currently not in a position to bring care to her patients."

TalkTherapy,fnesw1i,t1_fnes324,1586895266.0,"It's nice to see that you have support and people who understand and want you to feel better. Be thankful for them!

TalkTherapy,fn45rgl,t1_fn45au2,1586634618.0,"It's great and healthy that you're clear on boundaries with your therapist, I see many people on that thread with crazy unrealistic expectations. I agree that it's a paid service but you're also the one who brought up his trip. Again, it's a shame it ended that way and i'm sure you just did that with the best intentions, but I truly think it's something worth moving past if you think therapy with them makes a positive difference in your life. Definitely an odd situation and absolutely fair to want a second opinion about it!"
TalkTherapy,fn3x46w,t3_fz7hn4,1586629638.0,"Honestly, I can see why your therapist reacted that way. I also had a big trip planned this month and when people started telling me about the virus and how I wouldn't be allowed to go, I got really annoyed because it's the main thing i've kept getting up in the morning for, for months. Let's be honest, back in February nobody expected it to turn like this. 

That being said, it's kind of a shame that you'd want to give up on a therapist you worked with for so long over a trivial argument. But they have nothing to apologize for and it's not a part of his job to reach out, whether they care or not, it's just policy. You had a disagreement and it's a shame it took an entire therapy session, but I think you're making a big deal out of it. Do you also end friendships because you had one disagreement or does it have something to do with someone who's supposed to understand you thinking differently?"

TalkTherapy,fmxtxg3,t3_fxya0d,1586471797.0,"No offense but it creeps me out a bit that you say someone who isn't a part of your life anymore is the biggest influence. Sure, you could reach out to ask if they're okay, but are you sure you're not doing this because you want a reason to stay in touch?"
TalkTherapy,fmwwsrn,t1_fmwv2n7,1586454418.0,"Doesn't mean she doesn't know anyone else she could refer you to...It's up to her to find someone if they cannot provide for you at the moment, but it's up to you to stand for yourself and ask for help if you need it. 

Also, just want to point out that you have no idea why she's canceling therapy. Maybe she has kids at home all day and cannot find time/privacy to practice. Maybe she has personal issues and isn't in the mindset to do so. Just because you're the patient and she's the provider doesn't mean you can't try and be empathetic especially in times like this."
TalkTherapy,fmwux5z,t3_fxwkii,1586453473.0,"This situation is unprecedented and people are going to react differently. As a patient, I'm really reluctant to teletherapy as I feel awkward venting to a screen and get emotional while at home alone. I can absolutely understand how a therapist might feel like they cannot get their work done properly. 

Also, just want to point out that she probably didn't cancel all of your upcoming sessions, but all of HERS. with all of her patients. Nothing personal here. I would ask her if there's anyone else you could talk to in the meantime if that's important to you though."
TalkTherapy,fmwuc2g,t3_fxu8ow,1586453176.0,"WOWOWOW back up a second here, just because she forgot your name once doesn't mean she's going to drop you or doesn't care. Have you never forgotten anybody's name? Sounds like you're just finding excuses for yourself to not open up to them IMO..."

You'd be surprised at how people each have their own focus when looking at people, usually based on their own insecurities. For example, I focus on people's nose a lot because I used to be self-conscious about mine. Yet, whenever I mention it, most people say they didn't notice. 

Even if they did notice, maybe they figured it would make it more uncomfortable if they agreed they saw it. Or maybe they were just being polite. I wouldn't take it personally or relating to the therapist-patient relationship."

TalkTherapy,fmmepz8,t3_fvzyoe,1586203930.0,"If it were one of your family members feeling that way, would you want them to hide it or sugarcoat it the way you're doing? Would you want them to act on it, not to die but just to get the help they think they need?"
TalkTherapy,fmme2jf,t3_fw20w8,1586203599.0,"If you don't actually intend to hurt yourself, why wouldn't you talk about it? Therapists know very well the difference between passive suicidal ideations (i don't actually want to die, but it's somehow comforting to think about disappearing) and active suicidal thoughts (I do want to die and i intend to act towards that). 

Even if you did intend to, you're not burdening anyone by letting them do their job. You're paying for this service and protecting you in case you may be a danger to yourself is something agreed upon by all parties."
TalkTherapy,fmmcy91,t3_fw1gse,1586203031.0,"Stop making assumptions about what she's going to think. Ready to bet she's also gotten drunk and probably also drunk texted, she's human too and she'll understand. Just apologize and make sure that doesn't happen again."
TalkTherapy,fmlsui4,t3_fvzz85,1586192593.0,"Can a dietician help if you don't follow their diet? Can a teacher help if you don't listen in class? Same goes for therapists. Therapy isn't magic, therapy is hard work and perseverance and they're here to bring you guidance along the way. But you have to be willing to get better, and that's something they can't do for you. 

Tough love here: I think you're driving people away, and blame them by using it as justification that you're alone and will never get better. I know it because I've done it too. Someone didn't reach out when I needed it? Must be my fault, no point in bothering them next time. Therapist not understand you? Must be my fault, no point in booking the next appointment. Meds not working? Must be my fault, no point in keeping trying that. 

Not everything is going to work for you, but what matters is that you don't give up trying. It's not your fault that you feel that way, but it's still up to you to change it. Don't let your depression and self-esteem define who you are. You have other things to bring to the table. If that's how you like to function, prove them all wrong and show them you can do it."
TalkTherapy,fks8z3o,t3_fkalkc,1584484820.0,"You can reach out, but likely they're just trying to figure out how to set up everything, like most of us are..."
