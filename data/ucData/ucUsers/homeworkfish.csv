AmItheAsshole,fnmq61j,t1_fnlixlb,1587076054.0,"I think it is worth noting that though OP had their ADHD diagnosed previously this is new news to their friend. Finding out that kind of information may be a big deal to him because he has been dealing with the consequences of ADHD without knowing what is going on. John may feel like a ton of things make sense all of a sudden, so though for some people this probably isn't a big deal for john it might be. Also OP says they never heard about John going to a doctor, but that doesn't mean John didn't say anything to anyone else."
UCDavis,fnk2meg,t1_fninfqu,1587013171.0,Exactly! Like the UC Davis Website is not going to tell me anything about really being a student here
UCDavis,fnixwfr,t1_fnina31,1586988322.0,"Yeah I totally get it like there is no in between, either you see the YAY posts or the UGH ones"
UCDavis,fnixrv5,t1_fnijb6c,1586988255.0,"I think I have just seen a couple people complaining about us and I totally get it, like freshmen are always annoying and there are SO many of those posts right now. I think it just made me get a little defensive, sorry! Also, big thank you for linking the megathread I had seen a couple people reference it but I couldn't actually find it so thank you!"
UCDavis,fni7udt,t3_g1ttvf,1586975452.0,"As one of those prospective students I think one of the reasons we are flooding this sub is precisely because of all of this. It is not that we are too naive to look into the future but because we do need to plan in case everything returns to ""normal"" and if school is still online in the fall  then we have bigger problems than Davis vs SLO. We are trying to plan what we can. However, we do not have the ability to talk to our teachers, counselors, and classmates, we cannot visit campuses, we do not get the outside help you did.  Trying to figure out where to go to college is harder right now so we turn to here, where we can get some idea of the culture at UC Davis, the people who go here and the opportunities here."
AmItheAsshole,fmx2v1f,t1_fmtjtj9,1586457482.0,"""Having a twin brother tell his brother what to do is a problem, not an asset.""

Exactly, is twin A truly helping to resolve conflicts or is her just bossy? either way this is not creating a healthy environment to raise kids in."
AskWomen,fmrllas,t3_fwpgtp,1586327005.0,"There is also Pact (ethical as well as sustainable) has several great staple items.

I also like ""United by Blue"" which is also sustainable and ethical, though a lot of their stuff is really made for being outdoors more than everyday clothing."
AmItheAsshole,fmm8wgm,t1_fmm7pgt,1586200961.0,"So obviously I am not the original commenter but this is how I see it

Donating Blood: Might save someones life, eventually red blood cells die, not permanent

Donating Sperm: Permanent part of husbands history, real people walking around related to him, not life saving

Donating Sperm is also just less done/accepted socially (not a comment whether or not that is how it should be, just how it is). It is the kind of thing I would think you would tell your spouse. You were talking about your wife donating eggs but for you to know she would have had to tell you, this guy didn't tell his spouse she found out. I think part of the problem therefore is not just in the action itself but the hiding of it."
CasualConversation,fmm4mn8,t3_fvzc9z,1586198703.0,"I am one of those HS seniors and idk I just wanna say thank you for this. I feel so privileged to be in a position where I can complain about missing prom, there are so many people with much bigger problems. But it still sucks. There was so much I am not gong to be able to do, things we were supposed to have time to do, we were supposed to be able to say goodbye to each other, we were supposed to have time. And so many people, especially online it seems, feel like we are just whining? Anyway it has been getting frustrating to feel belittled? So thank you a million times, this makes me feel so much better, so seen."
