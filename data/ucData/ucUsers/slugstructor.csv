UCSC,fp4nacz,t1_fp4li9x,1588302800.0,"I took a quick glance and saw a lot of people being strident in a way that seems endemic to reddit.  People talking about how profs don’t understand IP addresses.  Is that so? People talking about how Chegg’s terms of service says they cooperate with university officials asking for info on who up/down loaded what, when. People saying this is all just a manufactured screen shot and not a real case.  I don’t know: it might be fake, but it seems believable to me.  People talking about how they are from a different institution but how “all their professors are out to get them” because they “can’t download spy software to their computers and watch them on their webcams”.  Hunh.  Right. I couldn’t keep reading.  It’s like reading about politics on reddit: sound and fury signifying a headache.

Over the past 7 years I’ve learned a lot about cheating cases.  I’ve seen some pretty convincing moral outrage from people who clearly cheated in amazingly stupid and detectable ways, but the slow burning deep resentment of cheating I see is more from the students who don’t cheat than the professors (most of the cheating I found in my lecture classes, I found because another student tipped me off).  Hell, we have SOE classes that are famous for doing zero detection of cheating, and students are incredibly resentful when the cheaters copy all the code and get better grades than folks who actually do the work and don’t do perfectly. 

I don’t know any professors who want to be cheating cops.  But most professors want to reward those who actually do the work, and most professors find cheating on important material to indicate a lack of professional ethics. Programs want their graduates to reflect well on them. Programs that systematically allow students to cheat become known and thought less of.

There is a lot of talk these days of ways to make it so students *can’t* cheat.  But that is very difficult to do when it comes to analytical thinking and even more difficult to do if assessment methods are used remotely and in private. 

I do not claim to be a wise woman. I don’t have any solutions to this quagmire of a situation. Well, I do have very good solutions: they are just infeasible.  I can find out what students know and what they can do very well with an in-person oral exam.  I can’t do that for a 400 student class.

Edited to add quotation marks.  No other change than this line."

UCSC,fp44wxy,t3_gb6v6t,1588291754.0,"I’m not in literature, humanities, or even in liberal arts, so take my answer with enough grains of salt to purse your lips, but I have a few thoughts.

First, this kind of thing was SOOOOOO much easier when you could just show up during office hours and ask people in person. Second, are you including a short, very specific paragraph about the area you are addressing and what you want to do?  Like really, assume no one at this school reads past the first paragraph: get right to the point. Third, do you have an ongoing relationship with any profs?  You are more likely to get a positive response from someone who already has a positive impression of you. Right now, a lot of faculty are a little lost and overwhelmed due to the same circumstances that leave a lot of students feeling a little lost and overwhelmed.  It’s even possible one of the people who you emailed actually thought about responding “yes” but lost your message in their inbox.  (Also, not all faculty are happy communicating electronically.)

Finally, the standard advice I give to engineering students when they don’t get a response from faculty is to email the chair of the pertinent department.  Are you comfortable doing this ?  Don’t whine or be confrontational.  Just be as emotionally neutral as you can about what your desire is, and then ask if they suggest a different way of going about it.

These are just thoughts from a professor who is not in your area."

If your instructor requires proctorU and you don’t want to use it, you will probably fail the course.  That is, you don’t have to use it, but you don’t have to take the course either.

Don’t get me wrong: I hate proctorU, but I hate a lot of things I have to put up with—especially now. I don’t deny that it is a security concern, but it is important to remember that proctorU values its association with UC, and there have been—as far as I know, and I would have more reason to know than many—no incidents with proctorU agents. To me, it is a little like trusting medical personnel to have many implements of destruction next to your unshielded person: uncomfortable, but sometimes necessary.

Also, it is unlikely to ever be an issue that you have finished the courses for a BA and we don’t allow you to have it, because you will be extremely unlikely to ever get into most of those courses—including ones you think you need for Cog Sci.  For example, CSE140 is restricted to CS majors for first pass, and has not had spaces after first pass for years.
