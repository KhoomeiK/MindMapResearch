Dear (Collegecakes),

Greetings from UC Santa Barbara. On behalf of my campus colleagues, I want to say how proud we are of your academic achievements. Your passion for learning, and your drive to enrich those around you, will greatly enhance our campus community. We understand that making an enrollment decision by the May 1st Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) deadline is a challenge without knowing the answers to all the questions you may have at this time. We are still hoping to schedule instruction on campus by the beginning of Fall Quarter, following all public health guidelines to ensure the safety of our campus community. We recognize that some students may not be able to be in residence in time for the Fall Quarter. If that is your situation, please know that we enthusiastically welcome you to UC Santa Barbara and will provide you with remote instruction and a full-time status in the Fall with courses appropriate for your intended major and general education requirements. We will be sending you more details, so please check your email regularly.

I look forward to you becoming part of our UC Santa Barbara family!

Lisa Przekop

Director of Admissions"
