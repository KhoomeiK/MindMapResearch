ApartmentHacks,fo0oaay,t3_g511xm,1587416721.0,"-check your city/state laws - certain places have put a cap on the percentage rent can be increased each calendar year.

-sounds like you lease from a property management company vs private owner. Reach out to corporate if you’re not getting a response from the site team. With everything the way it is now moves are stagnant and property management companies are doing all they can to get lease renewals. The on-site staff likely have their hands tied as they can’t usually control pricing

-you say you’ve looked at other apartments in the area but aren’t finding anything. Is this because of price? How does the price of your unit compare to others in your area? For example, I live in Southern California and paying $1800 for my 1 bedroom older apartment is considered a killer deal for my area. So just saying that you don’t want to pay $1k for an apartment on principle might not mean much if you consider prices in your area.

-a waived pet fee can be a big deal. Take that into consideration when looking to leave - a lot of places will/can charge you an additional pet deposit, fees, or pet rent that isn’t included in the advertised price.

-definitely ask about extending your lease terms - in a lot of places, that totally affects the price."

Admitted it was a long shot, but that was what popped into my head"
