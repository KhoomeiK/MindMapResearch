It’s better than him dying right? 

Just keep him locked up, doesn’t matter if it’s against the law fuck that. Keep your friend alive and he will thank you after. Best wishes"
steinsgate,fp2yq6n,t1_foyezi7,1588270130.0,"Yeah honestly I wanted to try and follow his chronological timeline, however, I think the best way to do that would be to watch through the first series and swap some episodes out with 0 and then at the very end watch the movie.

Again, still a lot of stuff to test haha"

steinsgate,foydwj3,t3_ga2qru,1588170742.0,"I have been experimenting with watch order, which is hard, because honestly each “show” can exist by itself. 

Most recently, I’ve actually found it very interesting to watch s;g 0 first, then the movie and finally the original series. 

I would like to go through and find a more complex order supplementing different episodes, but I’ve yet to work up the heart to watch it /again/"

Again while I’m no cat scientist, it’s very possible the green eyes are a recessive trait and the gold is dominant"
nebelung,fnh292j,t1_fngrhes,1586952889.0,"My cat (long hair, pointed wedge head (not a Maine coon)) has white paws and a white belly. Still don’t know if he’s a neb, but I mean honestly, what the hell else is he?

I want to make the distinction too that he is obviously not a purebred neb as that is truly very rare, however, it’s most likely a neb mix.

Then again I have no idea I’m no scientist I just fancy cats!"

VolvoRWD,fmkxki5,t3_fvr085,1586172419.0,Strong recommendation - check your main battery fuse. Should be in the engine bay coming off the positive terminal. I’ve fried one before or had it come loose and been totally stumped!
