This was very helpful thank you so much for sharing! 

It sounds exciting, I initially was born in Ukraine but moved in middle school to LA and lived few years in NYC too in my early 20s, and I‚Äôve just been thinking how tired I am with the cities and would love to move into a smaller green city or town closer to the nature. The eco friendliness of the campus was also one of the things that caught my attention."
