however my situation was a technicality issue with the FAO misinterpreting my FAFSA and my parents tax info.

that being said, i’ve done most of my contact through the message center. i think i selected the financial aid appeal topic when sending my question, but putting a broader topic or addressing it to the financial aid office in general will still get your message to the right place. for all the red tap at ucla, the organizations work effectively together sometimes, even if it’s not the most efficient.

i filled out the projected year income petition, because my issue was that ucla miscalculated how much my family would be making and have available for the next year to pay for my schooling.

how much you get will depend on how much you need financially and if ucla determined you need more or not. for me, they projected me to have a lot more available than i actually did, so after appealing, i became eligible for a lot more grants, both university and state based."
