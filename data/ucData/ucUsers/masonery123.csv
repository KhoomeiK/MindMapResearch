Though I think the main reason Dane stands out so so much in my mind is because of his F5 move (funny enough also literally the only reason Jackson would ever stand out in my mind).

I think it's not hard to argue that Ika played the best game in BBCan5, but I'm not sure who you could point to as the second best player other than Kevin.  There weren't many excellent players in the house.  Dem is certainly up there.  An argument could be made for Bruno as well.

I think it was very clearly perceived that Kevin was not making the strongest strategic decisions always and didn't do so well socially, but many many people were just dazzled with his amazing competition run winning out from final 8.

I'm curious as well, what are the ""lot"" of very poor moves?  I can point to one or two big ones (like using the veto on Ika which was really not that terrible for him anyway and was SUCH amazing tv) but I can't point to many more."

berkeley,foigy5u,t3_g7m1y1,1587786395.0,"I don't know about other UC schools, but as a math major here I think the math classes are very fair.  There are some tough ones like Math 1B (it sounds like you might be a transfer so you may not take this) and Math 104, but there are support systems and communities which are welcoming and will help you when it comes to the tougher classes.  I really wouldn't say I've ever had to think or worry about grade deflation before in the math department (though I guess that might vary based on the professor?) and honestly I rarely see anyone talking about overly harsh / unfair grading in the math major.

The classes are super fun, especially the upper divs, and the upper divs are mostly pretty small so that you get a close experience with the professor.  I've really enjoyed almost every math class I've taken here.  There are some bad egg professors but you learn who they are pretty quickly before getting anywhere near taking a class with them.  The workload overall has been very manageable for me and I've taken A LOT of math classes (2-3 every semester).  Though not everyone will have the same experience depending on what they take and what else is going on for them!

In terms of grad school, I think that the benefits of the Berkeley degree are pretty big.  I can't speak for other schools but there are quite a few people every year from the math department who get into very very good grad programs.  There's clearly some weight there, even if it comes with a little bit lower of a GPA.  I will say that the BA thing has no impact from what I know, any grad school will know that all Berkeley offers in Math is a BA.  It's possible that a job which doesn't know Berkeley's deal might ask a question about it, but very unlikely IMO."

berkeley,fnumz7r,t3_g3zbtc,1587265981.0,"The course numbers are just dependent on what the department decides.  You should be looking more at the department and the topic than at the number.

I'll say this:  The R1Bs are usually english/literature/arts departments, the R5Bs are typically other departments like languages or social sciences, and the R4Bs are all College Writing Program classes (which is kind of a separate entity from any of the literature departments).

The R1Bs tend to be perceived as a bit more work, the R4Bs in the middle and the R5Bs the least work.  This depends ENTIRELY on the instructor and the class, but it's a general expectation you can have.

I took an R4B and I thought it was excellent.  My professor was Michael Larkin (he's teaching another in the Fall).  The R4Bs tend to be more focused on a variety of different types of media and readings, and typically have a research oriented focus.  So you'll be learning skills for developing research proposals and writing academic (non literary analysis) argumentative papers.  I really enjoyed this focus, as a STEM major who didn't really want to put a ton of time into my R&C requirement.  I would say that 30ish pages is a reasonable amount to assume you'll be writing, and that's going to be pretty similar in any R1B.  Maybe a tiny bit less in an R5B depending on the instructor?  Keep in mind that 30ish pages amounted to like 3 4-page essays, an 8-10 page paper instead of a final exam, and weekly page-long informal responses to the week's reading.  Really not that crazy."

berkeley,fnb8jb7,t1_fnb67p1,1586811089.0,"I guess it depends on your major but the majority of classes at Cal are dependent on the professor.  I guess a lot of classes also have discussion section where you'll have closer interactions with a GSI.  The R1/2/4/5 A/B classes are different, they are really small classes of about 12-15 people usually, and they're mostly taught by a GSI.  However, the College Writing Program has a group of professors who teach R4A/B classes which are the same small size.  R4A classes, iirc, are for students who need to fulfill their entry level writing requirement, which you may have fulfilled by your SAT or ACT score or something else.  So R4A satisfies that and the first R&C requirement at once.  Many students don't need this.

R4B classes, on the other hand, are just like any other second R&C course.  They usually have a preset specific topic, and often focus on learning to do original research.  So if you're interested in any sort of science, I highly recommend one of them!  You'll learn better how to write academic research papers as opposed to creative writing or literary analysis.

In terms of my experience with Prof. Larkin, the class was about 15 people at 8am and was focused on social impacts of technological advancement.  We read some classic dystopian sci-fi short stories, the books Weapons of Math Destruction and Algorithms of Oppression, and wrote a few short papers through the semester on topics we came up with related to the readings.  Then at the end of the semester we each conducted our own individual research project and wrote a 12-15 page paper (along with some other stuff, my whole portfolio was maybe 25 pages) on a topic of our choice related to the class.  We spent a lot of time honing our topics together and getting ready, and it was nicely spread out over the last monthish so that there wasn't any sort of time crunch.  It was lots of fun.  I was taking 4 other technical 4 unit classes at the same time, which is a big courseload - I guess that should be an indication that the class wasn't super high workload but being in the middle of it everything seemed like a lot of work!  Prof. Larkin was also really organized, has tons of experience with teaching similar topics in R4B, and was super bright and funny even at 8am.  He very clearly cared for every student and did his best to make sure we were getting to know each other and to support each other.

Of course, I don't think you'd go wrong with any of the R4Bs!  The most important thing when choosing R&C classes is picking topics that interest you.  But if you're into technology and potential societal impacts at all, or maybe if you're into technology and think you don't care about the societal impacts, taking a class with him wouldn't be a bad idea."

I also am really really loving Math 219, Dynamical systems this semester.  Just fascinating result after fascinating result.

Outside of advanced math classes, I really loved my Colwrit R4B with Michael Larkin, which is surprising since I rarely like writing classes.  I highly recommend him or one of the other R4B classes if you need to fulfill the second R&C requirement, he's a full professor instead of a GSI, he's a really wonderful communicator, and he's so friendly and helpful.

I also loved CS61C, machine architecture, even if it was difficult to keep up and piece everything together at some point it's so worth it to walk away with a full understanding of how every level of a computer works.

In terms of classes I wasn't super into, I didn't really dislike any of my classes per se but I wasn't super into CS 170, the advanced algorithms class.  It's like a math class that isn't taught according to widely accepted math pedagogy.  I hear CS 70 and EE 16A/B are similar.  Like it's not helpful to just zoom through a proof on a slideshow and mumble the complicated steps, I need a moment to absorb things (anyone can tell I'm @ ing Rao but I still loved him and thought he was a hilarious guy).

It seems like you tried to take the game one week at a time and not overplan, but I'm curious if you were formulating any plans / intents for the endgame.  Say you make it deep in the game with Brooke but without the knowledge you have now outside of the house (stuff like Vanessa potentially turning the jury on her, and the conviction many HGs had that she was in control of the duo).   Were there any plans to cut her?"
berkeley,fmrhgz3,t1_fmrgtpu,1586323326.0,"you're right, i was mostly just being a mix of snarky and stupid"
berkeley,fmq6b1c,t1_fmq5iy3,1586293672.0,"bit of an ignorant take - many states do not have nearly the same resources and standards for education as california does, and even so not every student has access to those state schools.  i'm lucky enough that i would have had a pretty good option had i stayed in-state, and chose not to because berkeley was significantly better and i could make it work.  many many students are not in the same boat.

in any case, i was hardly referring specifically to berkeley - i'd be more than happy to see private schools take a hit from this and be forced to reconsider their financial model.  not that it's that simple."
berkeley,fmq5m0c,t3_fwskd2,1586293297.0,"If you've taken 16a, it will probably be fine.  They don't necessarily assume anything in 110, they just redo things quickly with a lot more mathematical rigor.  If Stankova is teaching it (thought I saw she was) I recommend it, I enjoyed taking it with her and didn't think the exams / problems were too punishing."
berkeley,fmq1ep5,t3_fwrwjo,1586291119.0,"wow, schools might have to reconsider gouging students for 60k per year - what a travesty"
BigBrother,fmovpbg,t1_fmnuydo,1586269403.0,"It's perfectly valid to watch and enjoy the show however you like!  You've been a fan of it longer than I have so if you are more passionate about it, that's cool!

Of course another nice thing is that if your expectations are low enough then you won't be able to get enough of BB22 just like how BB20 was after BB19 haha!"
BigBrother,fmnsowi,t3_fwdwrg,1586234195.0,"Ah yes, BBOTT, the pinnacle of Big Brother purity.

No hesitation from me, every season is different and plenty of seasons have had their fair share of weird quirks and unfair advantages.  I just try not to take it too seriously and enjoy the ride."
BigBrother,fmn8kdt,t3_fw9v6q,1586220490.0,"This is so exciting, wow!  The RHAP one was so much fun and I'm thinking of tuning in in general, but this will definitely grab a lot of attention."
BigBrother,fmn8g5c,t1_fmn5prm,1586220416.0,"You can find the best clips on twitter, Brent retweeted some from an account that posted a lot of them.  There are some REALLY good ones so I highly recommend going to check it out.  Rob is hilarious."
BigBrother,fmlhs5p,t1_fmklpyg,1586186679.0,"Kaela's performance could have been better but I think it also looks worse next to Paras's which is just so good.

Overall the BBCAN6 questioning+speeches were just stunning.  What a finale."
berkeley,fmkhkim,t3_fvtnou,1586155192.0,I just went to Chipotle Shattuck a few days ago.  Not sure about telegraph.
