Just send them along and reach out to the professor you want to work with to let them know that they should be receiving your scores soon (after you take the tests).

I put it on myself and I can't feel it. It doesn't hurt her at all. She doesn't yelp or jump, and she is a very vocal and whiny dog, so she 100% would. It's literally just a tap on the shoulder. Like, imagine you're watching TV and you're really into the show, and your partner is calling your name over and over, and you don't hear them because you're just so into what you're watching. If your partner comes over and taps you on the shoulder, you will definitely notice. That's all it is. 

We use it to break her concentration when she's super focused and aggro about another dog or human. She then turns around and we give her a treat and pets and praise. The person or dog that she was upset about passes by, and nothing bad happened to her. Over time, she begins to learn that when she's upset about something, she can just turn around and go to mom and dad and they will make her feel better and the scary thing will go away. It really gave us such a confident and happy dog. It genuinely does not hurt her, it is just a way of getting her attention."
reactivedogs,fnqeo0p,t1_fnq9ju9,1587163121.0,"My in laws have 7 dogs (it's a total f\*cking sh\*tshow) and we bring our dog when we fly home for the holidays. My FIL will hand out dog bones to everyone (that my dog doesn't even freaking like) and she will stalk out every bone and gather them in a pile and just snarl at the other dogs. I stupidly assumed that she loved them so I bought a huge value bag when we got home and she had no interest, lol.

Anyway, I will sometimes put her in our room with one to chew while we visit, but she'll usually only chew it while we're there. I think she wants us to help stand guard, or something. But, so, you could still give them high value treats to chew - just separate them and make sure they finish them (or pick them up if they don't). No reason to waste the bully sticks! Plus, chewing is good for their teeth if you can find a way for them to safely do it. Alternatively, I'm sure your local humane society would gladly take them off your hands. But supervised and separated chewing is likely possible.

However, I do want to emphasize that you definitely don't want his behavior to rub off on the puppy if you can avoid it. He probably doesn't see you as the pack leader, which is part of the problem, so he's acting out to assert his pseudo dominance. We got a trainer that used an e-collar and it was a huge help. Allowed us to communicate with our dog and redirect her attention to us when she was hyper focused and angry about something else. Basically told her to come to us and we'd make it okay. Gave us a much happier and well adjusted dog.

I was really lost and scared too, so, I get it. It will get better! The trainer really saved us to be honest. We spent like $1k but it gave us our dog back. Happy to chat more if you have specific questions about our experience or what to look for!"
reactivedogs,fnpt815,t1_fnpj6a8,1587151568.0,"I agree with this - if he can't handle high value treats, no more high value treats. Ever. It's that simple. His life won't be worse without them, and your life (and the puppy's life) will be better. The last time you want is your puppy to adopt these same behaviors. They have each other to play with.

If you have crates for them and really want to give them something to chew on (for teeth cleaning purposes), they can only have their high value treat in their crate. High value treat can't leave the crate, and other dog isn't allowed in. Not sure if that would cause a problem, but it's probably better than them resource guarding all over the house. Also, take the high value treat away except for them they're chewing on it.

We do this a lot with our dog. She's big into resource guarding when there's other dogs around, so anything high value is removed. Recently we were at the beach with her friend, and we threw a stick and they both went after it and got in a little tiff about it (nothing major, but they're best friends so I didn't expect any growling). Immediately after, I realized it was my mistake. They both resource guard, so they should each have their own stick - they shouldn't be running after the same one. Or, just no throwing sticks at all."
