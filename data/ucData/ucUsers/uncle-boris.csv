That’s not what I’m doing. That part is inherent in the standardized assessment of learning imposed by the educational establishments. I’m just pointing it out... It’s already a lab experiment, I’m just saying it happens to be set up particularly wrong this time around. 

>most professors are being lenient this quarter means that the overall benefit comes from just riding this out.

I don't know if this claim can be substantiated. If anything, mine have almost doubled down on assignments and grading. From the looks of it, most people in the thread echo a similar sentiment. Also, you can't ignore the inflated curve in good conscience.

&#x200B;

>Not to mention that if we force P/NP nearly guarantees that many  students will simply not attempt to learns as much as if they had letter  grades.

You can't force students to learn if they don't want to. Grading, even in normal circumstances, isn't an incentive to learn, it's an incentive to grind and give professors what they want. Learning is a personal choice, and there’s very little of it happening in pursuit of grades (or in the quarter system, for that matter).

>If you really want to go the ""rinse and repeat"" route, you really just  need to cancel the quarter outright, because nobody is learning as  effectively as they otherwise would, so having these classes on their  transcripts is misrepresentative of their knowledge compared to others.

That's exactly my point, it's misrepresentative. But also, some people have more responsibilities, have toxic family members, distracting study environments, etc. The playing field is completely uneven.   

That's why P/NP is the only option that falls just short of cancelling the quarter. None of us want to waste time like that, so P/NP is one alternative.

If the decision was made for a UC-wide mandatory P/NP (as with Columbia and Stanford), you wouldn’t even have a choice in the matter. It is what it is, the times dictate difficult measures. Since when do the interests of the few outweigh, in importance, the legitimate struggles faced by the majority? Who’s to guarantee you’re even gonna boost your GPA this quarter?"

I'm sorry but if you're gonna argue that grades this quarter don't matter, that argument can go both ways... If bad grades this quarter are irrelevant, then good ones are too. It's just the way things are unfortunately.

Going solely based off of who got into a good school from my community college and who didn’t (and knowing the qualifications of each group), I think were the decisions to be made public and reasons of rejections provided, people would be wholly outraged. And if we could run a statistical analysis on that data, I’m sure we could uncover a lot of bias."
politics,fnwprr6,t1_fnvdtpt,1587323038.0,"If you think about it, her logic in abstaining to vote on the recognition of the Armenian genocide boils down to the logic of protesting the claim “black lives matter” with “all lives matter.” Well, yes... they do, but so do black ones, so let’s strike while the iron’s hot. 

It proves to me, without a shadow of doubt, that she’s not a progressive. She’s a religious Sunni who’s ostensibly progressive but who gets really quiet any time the topic is Kurds or Armenians, and really nasty when the topic is Shias. If you’ve hung out with this type, you know...

For the rest of the world, to whom her Islamism is not yet apparent, I hope she’ll make it clearer in due time (or that she’ll abandon it altogether, but that’s unlikely). Believe me, I’m all for progressive Muslim representation, but she just ain’t it.

That said, don’t be afraid, I’m under no illusions that she’s of any particular threat to democracy or anything like that... I think we could do, and in fact do do, a lot worse than Omar. The swamp that is both chambers of Congress and the Supreme Court needs to be drained in general..."
