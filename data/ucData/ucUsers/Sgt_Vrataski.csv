UCSantaBarbara,fp78zsu,t3_gb34s8,1588366216.0,"I'm really hoping you'll be able to take advantage of the gen chem open office hours or schedule a meeting with your ta/instructor outside of office hours. Knowing providing individualized feedback is the most time consuming, you could perhaps see if your TA would be willing to send out a **general list of requirements for each lab report section** (stating a hypothesis etc.). Even preparing annotated rubrics for each report takes a *long* time, so it would help for your TA to just give a list of general expectations.

At some point, you as students do have to learn how to effectively communicate what you've done in lab without getting a list of specific things to include. Typos and things that require reading one sentence multiple times to figure out what you actually mean are not effective modes of communication.For gen chem you can go to ANYONE's office hour listed on Gauchospace (maybe ask if ochem professors have TAs doing these or would consider this). I've gotten questions about reports from other students and gotten questions about upcoming review /prelab questions and quiz questions from the previous weeks. Obviously we won't be reading through your reports during office hours and each TA grades their own 40-45 student chunk, but if you ask what a TA is looking for in the error discussion for example, any one may be willing to just state an example of what would or wouldn't qualify.

We do want you all to understand the material and do well, because the fewer errors you have, honestly the less of a headache we have trying to provide feedback. The idea that someone would not take off points for the same thing in the second report even without previous feedback from the first would maybe be okay if the TA never provided any information at all of their expectations AND if the points lost were for things not specifically on the rubric. However, those things not listed on the rubric are typically fundamental connections & information needed to explain the topic to a reader who ""does not know anything about it"". Even the students who do the best typically lose points for not including things specifically listed on the rubric let alone typos that make sentences incomplete. This is a course with a written component, so your communication skills are a factor in grading.

I know I make my own typos when I immediately write a document and don't proof-read after finishing it. What did you have to know in order to understand your results is the main important question that informs your entire discussion. If you are feeling stuck on some portion it is best to stop, work on some other assignment and come back to it later. While you are writing, you may know what you want to convey, but not write this out clearly. So, take a break and go back with those infamous ""fresh eyes"" to see if it really makes sense."
UCSantaBarbara,fp7626h,t1_fp4j6pc,1588364713.0,"I would ask if this quiz is graded by hand or by an online program. For **gen chem, the quizzes are online**, so typos may be automatically rejected as incorrect because they aren't included in the key database (I see some instructor is adjusting for typos in retrospect though, so hopefully this will be the quiz correction). In that case, trying to include all typos in a key is obviously not going to happen.Also, I'll put another comment about a possible way your TA could provide general advice while still taking longer to grade individual reports.We have 40-45 students in total with lab reports every week + most of us are answering emails throughout the day/preparing for addressing questions on any of the lab reports you have previously covered or are about to get to... and trying to carve out time for work related to our own degrees (courses or preparing or researching literature for articles/grant & fellowship applications) and that's only everything graduate ""student"" related (technically 2 jobs that don't overlap). So it is a lot on our plates and giving specific individual feedback is definitely the hardest, but having participation in zoom meetings is the best."
