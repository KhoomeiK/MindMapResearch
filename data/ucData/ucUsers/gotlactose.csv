Residency,fpmgfq0,t3_ge7cge,1588732527.0,"New interns, please remember there are other diagnoses other than COVID-19. I'm so tired of attendings, fellows, nurses, patients, and their families say everything is COVID. I actually had a bacterial pneumonia COVID-19 negative case during this pandemic. Please learn the other parts of medicine too."
Residency,fpk7n1u,t1_fpjy4a7,1588689558.0,"Yeah, I was expecting tree fiddy or the undertaker meme at the end.

We all have different perspectives on our student loans. If you’re fortunate enough to have federal loans, then you can always ride income based repayment until attending salary and pay it off more aggressively then. The balance between living comfortable within your means versus becoming extremely frugal to eek out a slightly higher loan repayment isn’t worth the wellness sacrifice given the stuff we deal with at work. If anything, my loans have been administratively deferred through September, then my attending salary will kick in. I’m in a 100% essential specialty, so I shouldn’t worry about being unemployed for doing only elective procedures. 

I realize not everyone has federal loans or are in essential specialties, but each to their own in regards to incomes, expenditures, and attitude towards their loans."

science,fpbwonz,t1_fpbfa7h,1588480706.0,"I’m tired of listening to the family of my patients with COVID on how they’ve “read up about COVID” and how they list off information specific to their case. I usually sigh and say it’s still a relatively new disease so we have yet to fully appreciate its variability and distribution of presenting signs and symptoms and not every symptom that is included in the atypical presentation of COVID warrants a retest or a third test because of the false negative rate. 

This coagulopathy scares me though. Benign hematology is hard enough already, now my hospital has new D-dimer algorithms to anticoagulate COVID cases. No guidance on how to manage COVID patients going home though."

Although I did have a PGY-4 rad onc ask me why the intubated patient he wanted to irradiate in MICU was breathing the way she was. I told him I could have the patient breathe however he wanted by adjusting the sedation and ventilator settings. He looked embarrassed that he forgot his ICU experiences. 

That’s okay, I don’t know jack shit about radiation oncology, he doesn’t have to know much about critical care. That’s why we have our own fields and consult each other."
Residency,foxaaq5,t1_fowctc2,1588138129.0,"Fake it until you make it. 

I don’t know if I would outright lie, but the answer I’ve settled with is “I am confident I have a reasonable chance of success in performing this procedure safely and correctly. If I weren’t, then I would not be doing it.” That can be true the first or millionth time you do a procedure. Case in point: I’m usually good at paracenteses, but couldn’t do a diagnostic one to save my life. My colleague helped me and got it in the first try. Second case in point: I’m 50/50 on LPs and my colleague asked me to help, I got it on the first try. Both scenarios, I was confident I had a reasonable chance of success performing each procedure safely and correctly.

Don’t ask me to do a crash fem line though."

Residency,foiey3z,t1_fohubx6,1587785077.0,"I haven’t made up my mind where I stand about capping the number of ACGME spots. On one hand, it’s important to keep an eye on the supply and demand otherwise we turn into other fields like pharmacy and law where too many students graduate and can’t find jobs. On the other hand, our program operates at a large underserved hospital and almost every program is always short staffed, residents would benefit from having more co-residents because each resident is usually doing more work than is humanely reasonable while being told “wellness matters!”"

I love how some attendings and fellows make you feel bad you’re not an expert in their field when you start a rotation on their consult service. “Just because Tony Stark built this in a cave with nothing but a box of scraps doesn’t mean I can do a three year fellowship and become board certified in your field overnight.”"

mintuit,fo1qo0q,t1_fo0ppex,1587439244.0,It made my head spin trying to figure out whether or not this had to be paid back. I’m in a rare scenario where 1) I didn’t lose my job in 2020 and qualified for the full $1200 because my 2019 income was below the threshold and 2) my 2020 income will be well above the threshold.

AskDocs,fo1alqk,t1_fo15p5n,1587429167.0,"This is very provider and region dependent. At my hospital, we would try to stay away from morphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), Norcos, Oxy, etc. We have a decent opioid use disorder team and we're starting to get more liberal with the use of buprenorphine (Suboxone) and methadone for pain control in setting of opioid use disorder. Our doctors are getting certified to prescribe Suboxone for use after discharge, but adoption in our community is still hit-or-miss. Methadone is a pain in the ass because the patients have to wait in line for their methadone every day at their methadone clinic."
