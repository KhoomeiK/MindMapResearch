AskMen,fpfev3i,t3_gd2gbv,1588569195.0,"In the least objectifying way possible, I think being a nurse is quite attractive.

In my experience, nurses are more down to earth than doctors, which makes them more pleasant to be around. You help people in a very tangible way, and like you said, it's got a ton of benefits. I don't have anything negative to say about nursing, regardless of gender. Maybe they're kinda stuck up when they're students, but... aren't we all"

UCSD,fp51edz,t3_gbc9dq,1588313241.0,"I didn't decide between them but they're very different which I'm sure you know. You can extrapolate from the quick comparison points below the student body/campus community vibes.

USD: small, Christian roots, private

UCSD: BIG, public, research-oriented, less expensive 

I totally understand struggling to make a decision, I think I also committed on 4/30. I learned in psych just this week that our unconscious minds are better at making big decisions (like which university to go to) than our conscious deliberations. Go with your gut :) 

If you don't like that answer, when in doubt pick the more financially-wise choice. Good luck!"

UCSD,fo9lz3g,t3_g6d7nw,1587623471.0,"My biggest issue is being in ""home mode"" vs ""school mode."" Because of that, I've tried to separate where I'm ""in"" school compared to everything else. I have a designated room where I ""attend"" lecture and thankfully my parents respect that and don't interrupt me while I'm working there. I do my homework all over the house because I would go insane staying in that one room. I've made myself a set up with a card table and a folding chair because I don't have a desk, and lecture from the couch would put me in home mode. 

I go to lecture in real time, most of mine are Zoomed. I figure I planned to be in class at this time anyway, so I might as well go now rather than having to do it later. For my class that's a prerecorded lecture video, I make sure I watch it the same week for which it's designated so that I don't get too behind and have to try to focus on a whole bunch of new material at once. 

I think the biggest thing is treating your work differently from how you treat your free time. The easiest way for me to do that is by being in a physically different location and position when I'm trying to focus."

Fit: a functional and an aesthetic term to me. Someone who is fit can run and swim and dance and be active without getting noticeably tired. I also associate fitness with an athletic body type: low (but still healthy) body fat, defined muscles."

Minors don't show up on your degree, and employers don't care that much. I think that what 1 major and 2 minors is attainable, especially since you're so close to completeing 1 minor, but if the second minor would push you to take (and thus pay for) summer classes that you otherwise wouldn't, it's not worth it. It might be better to just take classes you're interested in (so, environmental science) with any extra units you have, but avoid the nasty required series ones and don't force youself to get the wholeass minor"

Points for honesty, I guess. Anyway, as others have said, go talk to her. Introduce yourself, tell her you hear her crying frequently, and offer her something: a card, or a meal. Even if you just take over a single serving of spaghetti dinner or a fast food meal, it shows you're trying to help. You don't have to become her best friend, just show compassion while making her aware that others notice her. If you're really feeling bold, give her your phone number or email and invite her to reach out to you if she needs someone to talk to."
