I agree, I asked because I don’t think anyone has a perfect solution that’s gonna work for both educators and students right now without a fallout somewhere. Maybe this quarter will point out some flaws in both the delivery method of online education and where the lines of privacy, integrity, and learning interact and where their boundaries lie."

UCSC,fp4ifhd,t1_fp4h7x8,1588299745.0,Have you been following what’s going on at Boston/Rutgers with the Chegg investigations? Curious to see how a professor we know feels about it.
UCSC,fp4b22d,t3_gb8091,1588295287.0,"just so you guys know this isn’t from ucsc, this is from an east coast school (boston U i think) who have had a massive chegg/cheating scandal that has been going on for the last several days."
