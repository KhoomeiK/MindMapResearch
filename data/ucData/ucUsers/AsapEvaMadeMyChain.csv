There‚Äôs 2 sides to it, in vitro (benchwork) and in vivo (animal work). It‚Äôs usually complete luck what your lab will train you on. But let me tell you, knowing animal work skills will help you a lot. I slaved doing animal work for 5 years during undergrad and after. I hated it, but I became good at it, and people treated me like a wizard.  I was the go to guy who trained grad students, post docs, and even helped refresh project scientists. Years later I earned my stripes, became lab manager and I‚Äôm headed into bioinformatics. 

In the next couple years, there will be a lot of vaccines and drugs in development by non profit academic organizations and biotech companies. They only need so many people working with cells in vitro, but the will need a shit ton of people doing the animal work for preclinical studies.

CozyPlaces,fnc5dux,t3_g0r1gk,1586828976.0,"This is the dream room I never had. I'm a full grown man and I'm hitting that age soon, where I need to have an adult room. 

Growing up, I never had my own room, even after we went from poor to doing well. My mother and the aunts/uncles who lived with us never understood personal space or rooms. I always had to sleep on the couch or live in someone else's room in the house. From middle school to high school, I dreamed of a room like this. After I moved to my current place in the middle of college, I finally had my own room. Yet, that youthful creativity and drive to set up my own space was clouded by stress, drama and a packed schedule. Now that life is finally settled, I wish I could have a room like this, but I can't. When I visit my college friends at their homes, I always felt a sense of melancholy, when they would take me into the rooms they grew up in, and had me sleep in their brothers' rooms, which gives off the same vibe of this picture.

My mom in Florida set up a room for me after she moved there and achieved her American dream a few years ago. The room looks very clean and sterile, since there's no history to the room. There's a nice tea table with chairs and it looks almost like a cozy 4 star hotel room. She always reminds me I can move in with her and live that life we never had 10-15 years ago. Sadly it's too late and I have my own life. As much as she wants to make up for being an imperfect mother to me all those years ago, and treat me as her little kid again, there's no going back."

UnresolvedMysteries,fn95jm7,t1_fn85mpx,1586760157.0,"My the old version of my mom used fear and intimidation. I lived my life thinking I could be out on the streets and disowned at any moment. My mom softened up after the money started coming in. And while I have a love and extreme hate relationship with her, I‚Äôm blessed to not have fucked up like half my old friends. Now the mother I know is completely unrecognizable from my old mom.

The area I grew up in used to be full of people like Ray. I would say 1 in 5 people were had some serious psychopathic and narcissistic traits. You know how to avoid most of them because you know they‚Äôre weird or fucked up. There are some who seem very genuine. Basically they can identify your wants and what you‚Äôre missing. They know more about you than you know about yourself. Then the ‚Äúintelligent big brother I never had‚Äù cult like BS, control, leeching, and destruction of friendships/families begin.

I would say 5 of my old friends (from high school and earlier) were some variation of Ray. I watched them go from bright type A kids from bad backgrounds and fucked up families, to being a full manipulative psychopath or extreme controlling narcissist in early adulthood. They had to learn to read people very well at a young age and didn‚Äôt get proper emotional development. They had to act like an adult faster, then combine that with childhood trauma + an innate type A personality, and you get someone who becomes an ‚Äúolder brother X person never had‚Äù. To me they were the ‚Äúfriends who are on the same mental wavelengths as I am‚Äù. I used to be more cocky and arrogant, like the Iamverysmart type. I won‚Äôt lie though, back then a lot of people around me I felt were dumb as rocks or extremely closed minded prudes. Those guys and I naturally had the same mindset and could complete each other‚Äôs sentences. 

I later dipped out of way too many friend circles before it got real bad. And a lot of people in my old friend circles lacked something major in themselves. It wasn‚Äôt until I went to college, where I met so many people who were well adjusted and wouldn‚Äôt fall for people like Ray. 

Some of those Sarah Lawrence students all happened to have some underlying problems like depression, relationship issues, ect. And I can see how normal parents can‚Äôt help their kids in the way non parents can. Teens and young adults tend to be assholes to the people who love them the most, because they subconsciously know those people are least likely to leave them. A lot of people take for granted the loved ones in their lives, including myself not long ago. Not every parent has the solution, charm or benevolent iron fist to keep their kids 100% in line. My personal opinion is a well raised and well loved child with parents who talk to them enough would come around at some point. 

I want to have kids one day, but the knowledge that people like my former friends and Ray exist out there disturbs me. I will make sure, if I become a father, that I‚Äôll appear like the ‚Äúpillar of community‚Äù type or the really relatable cool dad type, so they won‚Äôt have to fall into the arms of another (unless it‚Äôs a healthy romantic relationship). I‚Äôll give them good space and understanding too."

solotravel,fn57n8a,t3_fzcrci,1586657894.0,"Overrated: 

Cancun - Was overly touristed and lacked the real soul of a natural city. A lot people trying to sell things to you and prices are higher than most of Mexico. If you want to have nice beaches in a tropical environment, there are plenty of other places that won't cost you an arm and leg. And will give you a much more authentic experience. We did enjoy renting a car and driving out to Isla Holbox, while seeing the real Yucatan peninsula. If you go to Cancun, I recommend leaving the city and seeing what the region has to offer. Watch out for corrupt cops at the city outskirts. They tried to take a bribe of $200 on the spot for ""speeding"" in a non moving line of cars. My girlfriend threatened him by calling the embassy and he backed off. 

Barcelona - Walking the suburbs at night was cool. Most of the actual city felt like a Barcelona themed theme park. A lot of pickpockets too. The coastal area was alright. We rode scooters from one end to that big hotel building. We sat around on some benches, and thought ""okay... I guess this is cool"". I imagine if you had some friends there and hung out in the suburbs it'd be a blast. 

Cartagena - Walled city looked nice. Chartering a boat out to the nearby island beaches was cool. Other than that, in the walled city and beaches, you will be hounded by vendors trying to sell you stuff. You will get approached at least twice a day by rappers looking for a tip. Also, I am no exaggerating, but at a beach, like Tierra Isla Bomba, you will not be able to relax more than 5 minutes without someone trying to sell you something. You close your eyes and try to soak in the sun and sand? 3 minutes later, someone will give you an unsolicited massage on your neck or feet. After shooing them away, 4 minutes later some guy will wake you from your slumber to sell you trinkets. My friend laid on his belly for 10 minutes after going to hidden location and his phone got stolen. We tracked it to 100 miles away the next day. I feel bad for the Venezuelan refugees, and if I was a multimillionaire who could work remotely, I would love to start a non-profit in Colombia to employ them. However, I'm just a 20-something trying to see the world on a budget.

Underrated: 

Most Mexican cities, except border cities - Great culture, great people, great food and the history is the cherry on top. Not to mention great for your wallet. It's a lot of fun being in those places. Very easy to make friends and meet people. Monterrey, in my opinion is the most slept on city in Mexico. The city might not have the deep history that Mexico or Guadalajara has, but the place is like Wakanda. After the next world cup, which Monterrey is hosting, the city will be full of tourists. 

Fukuoka - Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka may be the main cities tourists visit, but the south of Japan is a different game. People are more relaxed and the city environment scape looks better. Once you're in Tokyo or Osaka too long, you start to catch the general emotion in those cities. Fukuoka is a refreshment to your mindset. Very few, if any tourists, and people are happy to see a foreigner. Not to mention if it's the summer time, the weather is much better in the South."

asklatinamerica,fmugww7,t1_fmtd182,1586391183.0,"They do. All the backward establishment candidates got behind demented Biden to stop progress and continue the stagnation of this country. I feel bad for Biden, he's like that old uncle who's not a bad person, but has backwards beliefs from his old days and is beginning to have Alzheimers. He keeps getting confused and doesn't even know what's happening half the time. Trump is going to steamroll his ass in the debates and win the election again. 

Every time a smart person seeking progress comes around, like Yang or Biden, the media, billionaires, hyper-millionaires (10s-100s of millions), and the establishment politicians always conspire to bring them down with fake news, fake advertisements, and paying off people. The DNC has so much power, even if Bernie had the majority, they can choose not to let him run. 

Also, certain states like Texas have been actively making it harder for the poor and minorities to vote, so progressive candidates can't get voted for.

Globalization has definitely been merciless to the non college educated middle class. In thriving coastal metropolitan areas, there are abundant jobs. There are even modern manufacturing jobs (biomedical, defense related, ect.), like the ones most of my family members are employed in. However, with weak union representation compared to decades ago, these jobs don't exactly give people the buying power they used to have. My mom is unionized, so she's doing very well. I'm unionized at my government job, and I'm doing okay. Most people aren't and while many may not be struggling, they definitely aren't getting ahead like they could have 20-40 years ago. 

The federal government needs to do a better job at promoting unionization and strengthening union laws, while continuing to work on better trade deals. We have Reagan, Clinton, and all the old timey establishment asshats of both parties to thank for the stagnation of America."
asklatinamerica,fmtrtk5,t1_fmtj64y,1586377904.0,"As an American, I actually do think we are stagnating. A fraction of our population, mainly people who live in strong economic centers, like California, Texas, New York, ect. have a better shot at doing okay in life. And it's mainly children of better off families now who are getting into good schools and later on landing good jobs, going to grad school, or launching a start up. 

Back in the 1950s to early 2000s, it was easier for the poor and working class children to attain better lives for themselves. Back then, someone can graduate high school, go to trade school, or get a work apprenticeship doing something like metal cutting, and make a good middle class living. Then they can invest that money into formerly cheaper real estate, make more money, and become a millionaire by the time they're in their 40s-50s. 

The above example is still possible today, to an extent, but not as common. Our income inequality, healthcare cost burden, student loan burden, ect. have been slowing down young peoples' progress. It's not an absolute barrier to success, but  there are extra obstacles that used to not exist. From my understanding, a lot of developed nations have been tough for the recent young generations, like Western Europe and Korea. 

This is my perspective as one of the lucky people who started off in the bottom 10%, family became more fortunate over time, I got into a prestigious school, and ended up doing okay in my mid 20s. I'm nowhere doing as well as my friends from well educated and wealthy families, but I am doing better than half the country. Most of my childhood friends from less fortunate families (or lack of a family) never ended up getting anywhere in life and they're stuck. Back then, they would have been able to get a decent job out of high school and make progress."
