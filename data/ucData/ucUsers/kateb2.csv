They don’t even exist anymore"
UCSantaBarbara,fnk7iz7,t1_fnk4ib1,1587017340.0,I agree with that. Voting to stop increasing fees and advocating for survivors are realistic goals that I think all students can get behind.
UCSantaBarbara,fnjzlgo,t1_fnjowue,1587010843.0,Don’t vote for those candidates. There are a few that have realistic goals like voting against new student fees and advocating for survivors. It takes forever to filter out the candidates who promise everything though.
UCSantaBarbara,fnjtxz1,t3_g25xmg,1587006922.0,You know there is other stuff on the ballot besides candidates right? Your wording is going to tell people they shouldn’t vote even though candidates are like less than half of the AS Elections. You should edit it to tell everyone that there are a ton of student fees on the ballot every year. Personally I vote so I can tell the school “no” on some of the BS fees they make us pay.
UCSantaBarbara,fhw8gtt,t3_f4jr59,1581909005.0,No it isn't
