From a student perspective itâ€™s great cuz itâ€™s exactly like going to school, see ur friends, have fun.

But from a logical stand point, it ruins the whole point of social distancing. There no way the campus will stop students from hanging out when there are no parents or anyone stopping them. Iâ€™d argue more people would hang out with their friends since online classes means more free time (for many who skip lectures).

Also the gym would probably be closed, and no parties. It would literally be pointless."
