I got a matte protective cover for my laptop screen about a year ago that really helped, since my eyes didn’t have to strain with all the glare. I recently got blue-light filtering glasses that seem to help, I’m not 100% sure they actually work but worth a try!"
ucla,forpm13,t3_g8vkm4,1588016278.0,"honestly, clusters are kind of hard. especially as a freshman, the workload for mine (modern thought) was pretty heavy, and i know this applied to lots of my friends in different clusters. i think the trick is to choose one you’re genuinely interested in, because there will be tons of reading and discussion for it!!

also, it really depends on your TA. first quarter i went to every lecture and didn’t understand the material and wasn’t super interested in what was being taught, but i got an amazing TA for my last quarter and learned more than i did all year and was actually excited to get to discussion each week!

edit: to clarify, i’d recommend a cluster if you want to skip a bunch of GE requirements, but only if you’re actually interested in it. it did help my GPA, but i could’ve boosted my GPA more if i took those GE’s separately over time."
ucla,fols64i,t3_g84ka0,1587869211.0,this is so pretty!!!!
ucla,focrije,t3_fxmko6,1587674882.0,can anyone pm the link to the groupme?? especially now that the midterm is open collaboration!
ucla,fnrubdz,t3_g1kaqp,1587201851.0,i will say that it’s a little confusing at times if you haven’t taken a lab course before BUT huge pros are that you dont have to actually do the hardest parts (labs) and only deal with pre-labs/post-labs! my TA has been super good about responding to emails/questions for help so i would recommend taking it online!
