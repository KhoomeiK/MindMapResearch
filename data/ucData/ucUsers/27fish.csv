AmItheAsshole,fos9jcc,t1_fos6mhe,1588026440.0,"its finals season and I’m a BioE major, it's perfectly reasonable and pretty common."
AmItheAsshole,fos8coe,t1_fos4ud1,1588025820.0,"like I said, I got to plenty of doctors and pain specialists. I’ve had multiple surgeries. I AM ”working on it”. 

I exercise plenty. I have 8+ hours when I can exercise while the whole family is awake. There is no need for it to be at 7am or 11pm.

Walking is painful when I have a migraine, not in general. I go on plenty of walks.

keyword: in most cases

I’m sure you want to help me, and I appreciate that, but you do not know my medical history. You are not my doctor. 

PLEASE stop telling me what causes/ how to treat my disorder. You just do not know that."
AmItheAsshole,fos752b,t1_fos0vz6,1588025181.0,"not quite but very very similar. 

And yeah, but it seems to go in one ear and out the other lol

She really has my best interests at heart, but that doesn't always translate to my best health."
AmItheAsshole,fos5y6i,t1_forxtng,1588024570.0,I can work just fine and am plenty successful. Again with the assumptions.
AmItheAsshole,fos5vdm,t1_forv0k2,1588024531.0,"THANK YOU, people out here are acting like they are a professional pain specialist."
AmItheAsshole,fos5goo,t1_fornql5,1588024320.0,"
also for your ”edit” I dont force people to be quiet when I’m asleep, nothing I said indicates that because its not true. They come into my room to wake me, that is the only time they wake me. I have no idea where you got that. Same thing with me ”roaming around”. I’ve got schoolwork to do, Im not doing jumping jacks in the hallway. 

You are putting characteristics on me that I have given absolutely no indication of having. I’m not someone you know, so please don't 1) diagnose my own illness -seriously who the fuck do you think you are- and 2) assign me actions I’ve never done.



It is one thing to say, its better to wake up earlier- fine- it is COMPLETELY different to say my illness is caused by me staying up late."
AmItheAsshole,fos2s17,t1_forz7ga,1588022927.0,"we are different people with different symptoms who have the same hereditary disease. Not all treatments and therapies are universal, even for the same disorder

Any medical professional could tell you as much. I assume you arent one"
AmItheAsshole,forygvn,t1_forsqqw,1588020719.0,"I'm not trying to imply that they are abusive, its nothing that dramatic lol. As I said, I love my family, but this is a point of conflict between us.

I figured that I was meeting their expectations as I was doing well in school, getting my chores done, and spending time with them. I suppose I never saw it as an expectation in the same sense that my other duties are. 

I thought that since I was doing all I thought needed to be done, I can sleep as I please. It is something I’ll have to discuss with them."
AmItheAsshole,forwmvm,t1_foru2pu,1588019802.0,"I don’t like them waking me up, but I understand why they are doing it, sorry if my wording was confusing.

the issue I have i the aggressiveness and shame they use to get me up, ie. my little brother coming in to mock me and say how lazy I am for sleeping in, or my dad yelling at me.

I know they mean well, but I dont think it is helping anything.

I should probably clarify that"
AmItheAsshole,forvuen,t1_fornql5,1588019406.0,"Its heriditary, nerve damage from an inherited joint disorder. I’ve had it somce I was an infant.

you are making hella assumptions, back up a bit"
AmItheAsshole,forvf87,t1_forpynd,1588019198.0,"but it has repeatedly made things worse. Although we have the same condition, we are two entirely different people. Certain medicine and therapies work for me and not her and vice versa. 

I’m not saying she isn't trying to help me, she definitely is, but going out in the bright sun when you have a light-sensitive migraine is not helpful. 

also, bold of you to assume I haven't been going/listening to doctors"
AmItheAsshole,forubjp,t1_forn9bf,1588018644.0,"eh, they dont really deserve that lol, but thanks"
AmItheAsshole,foru2kz,t1_fornlnh,1588018521.0,"they definitely mean well, and you are correct in assuming I'm a little grumpy rn

thanks"
AmItheAsshole,fortuyw,t1_formxvg,1588018416.0,"Yeah, you're totally right. Thanks :)"
AmItheAsshole,fortkmx,t1_forrooj,1588018274.0,I'm just trying to clarify that they aren’t just checking up on me once or twice. Bad wording lol

berkeley,folfqkf,t3_g84ca4,1587861260.0,"idk if they can do away with triples, logistically. Over half of the rooms are offered are triples and Cal has to guarantee all-freshman housing. I dont know how they would be able to accommodate their students w/o triples.

Obviously it would be the right thing to do for our health, but I dont think its feasible for Cal anytime soon. Maybe they will start building more housing over the summer, but... I wouldn't expect anything for this fall or spring."
