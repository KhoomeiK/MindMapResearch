ucr,fog0ea3,t3_g6g5ch,1587745966.0,"Is that String manipulation? That's easy, just wait until you get to arrays and pointers, those are annoying especially when you can just import vectors and use those. Also be glad you don't have to setup your own development environment, 167 and 153 had me do that, took a full 2 weeks to get everything mostly working."

ucr,fmx01kw,t1_fmv6pvt,1586456050.0,"Everything that counts as basic discreet math. Systems of equations, logs, summations, roots of cubics, proof by induction, to name a few. And these are not easy problems that you can brute force, no if you try to brute force one it will take you an hour so you need to know the strat to do them in less than 5 minutes."
ucr,fmsgjij,t3_fx0ug9,1586355010.0,What really sucks for me is that zooms audio breaks during lectures so no one can understand what the professor is saying. How are supposed to learn like that?
ucr,fmhukyh,t1_fmgis4t,1586093951.0,"Nope, zoom can only tell if the window is in focus or not when there is screen sharing, and it says that your not paying attention if zoom isn't focused for 30 seconds. It's also off by default so I don't think many professors have it enabled anyways."
