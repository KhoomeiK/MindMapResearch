WPI,fnydlb1,t3_g4lvgq,1587360002.0,"1. If you NR your gpa wont be affected because there is no record. On the other hand if you pass with a C it will. Thats where the pass/fail comes into play, it will not count towards your gpa if you choose the pass/fail for that class.

2. You get up to 2 NRâ€™s a semester until you get academic warning/ merit scholarships start to be affected.

Hope this helps"

WPI,fmtf8gn,t1_fmte6gi,1586371711.0,Right. Maybe endowment wasnt the best example. And no I dont know how res services finances play out in this. I just hoped for a better resolution other than having to fork out 500.
WPI,fmtdmio,t1_fmtcyrx,1586370952.0,Over 500 million in endowment. Explain.

WPI,fmt5xw5,t1_fmt5mvc,1586367389.0,Its not that they will get the money. Its that they arenâ€™t offering to pay for this service. Esspecially in this financially unstable time for many.
WPI,fmkcz7f,t3_fvso2o,1586150944.0,Quick take. What would happen if this pandemic continued into the summer and fall semesters. Would everything start to stay online?? Would it even be worth paying for if its just online courses and not college life/ resources.
