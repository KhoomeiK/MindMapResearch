1. There’s revenge on abusers
2. The girls end up together and are happy"
actuallesbians,foodedf,t1_foo139t,1587936988.0,Pronouns are not gendered - it’s our society that ascribes them to gender. Lesbians are lesbians no matter what pronouns they use.
actuallesbians,foocrxz,t1_foocgxx,1587936684.0,I’m sorry but the split attraction model is only a thing for the asexual community. There are no bi or pan lesbians
actuallesbians,fooc7o0,t1_fomt1a4,1587936412.0,"Um I only put “women’s spaces” in quotes because in lesbian spaces there are non-binary lesbians, some two spirit people, etc. Basically some people who are not women. I think there should certainly be all women or all lesbian/q*eer women spaces. What I meant is that TERFS gate-keep spaces where trans women, non-binary lesbians, etc. should be. 
It’s not toxic for communities to respectful have their own space. In any community, allyship is great but a good ally knows that there should be a place/time for just the community members"
actuallesbians,folzfby,t1_folqbgh,1587874228.0,"It's also worth noting that TERFS do a lot of this under the guise of ""protecting women"" or keeping ""men"" out of ""women's spaces"". it's really manipulative and evil IMO"

actuallesbians,fo4mysi,t3_g5nb7n,1587507365.0,"regarding any situation, it's not helpful to be too much inside your own head. instead, focus on tangible things. you definitely have an attraction to girls, experiment with them in real life! (but be completely upfront about your intentions, it's bad to use people or lead them on)

a lot of people (including myself) like labels and find them empowering, but if you don't, don't feel pressured to have to conform to one! that being said compulsory heterosexuality is a real thing and might even be something you struggle with for a long time. for me, there are a few male celebrities I find really attractive, but the idea of actually being with, dating, and marrying a man makes my skin crawl. 

you are the only one who knows yourself, so I suggest getting out there and exploring. just make sure you aren't hurting other people along the way"

Unless you live within 3-4 hours of UCSB and plan on going home often, I feel like cars aren’t essential for freshman year, or if you live in a dorm in general. It’s necessary for when you live off campus and want to grocery shop/take trips/etc., but not as freshman

2. Bikes are easy and everywhere. Quick and efficient

3. If you don’t have a bike everything is walkable if you live on campus. I didn’t have a bike for a year and I was fine Average of 10 min walk to classes, most is 20

4. Student Health has a pharmacy and I’m sure you can contact them with your needs. There is also a CVS nearby that is very accessible by bus"

actuallesbians,fne3wqo,t3_g18nkc,1586882611.0,"make of this what you will, but pronouns do not equal gender. some lesbians use they/them or he/him pronouns and are still lesbians, whether they identify as cis women or non-binary. I've never been a fan of the argument ""labels are unnecessary/bad"" because people are sometimes very proud of their labels, but if you really like this person, it doesn't need to shift your whole identity. I  don't know your or their whole situation so I don't know if I can give the proper advice"
actuallesbians,fndziev,t3_g12zkx,1586880370.0,"Abdellatif Kechiche, director of *Blue is the Warmest Color*, not only has assault allegations against him but both actresses said they were uncomfortable shooting the sex scenes among other issues. 

Park Chan Wook, director of *The Handmaiden*, made sure the actresses were comfortable, had consultants to make sure scenes weren't exploitative, and shot sex scenes on closed sets with either all-female crew or through a remotely operated camera. 

I can find direct sources if people want them, but overall *The Handmaiden* was a healthier work environment and healthier love story. And as someone mentioned earlier, the reason some of the Handmaiden sex scenes have male-gaze is that the character Hideko is a sex worker who only knows about lesbian sex through exploitive literature."
