100% agree with your statement. I asked one of my professors what the greatest thing a mathematician could do in the world was, and he said teach elementary school."
berkeley,fom7sfa,t3_g7khv5,1587880835.0,"My reason: for my major (math) Berkeley has a better undergraduate program (imo). Plus I prefer the semester system, so I'm sticking with that for as long as possible. UCLA has a great graduate program in math, which I will definitely apply to when I graduate. Oh, and I'm a 45 minute drive away from Cal. That helps."

berkeley,fo4k44z,t3_fqdm9d,1587505875.0,"I'm an incoming mathematics transfer student. I'll be starting with upper-division classes. I am reasonably comfortable with proof techniques. Professors of mine at my CCC (SRJC) who have attended Berkeley have recommended Math 104 and 113 as my first two classes, since many later classes have either one or both as pre-recs. What do you think is a good place to start for math at Cal? I've heard that Math 110 is good, and I am *very* comfortable with proof-based linear algebra.

EDIT: A word. Also, I've noticed on the schedule of classes, that most 113 and 104 classes don't show who's teaching them yet."

Christian,flzj9ma,t3_fs52mz,1585625019.0,"I have experienced severe OCD since I was young. When I first had symptoms as a child, I had no idea what was happening to me. I was in a family that didn't beleive in mental illness so I only began to figure out was going on with me in my late teens.

The psychological difference between being led by God and OCD is significant. My obsessions were clearly not of God (not being able to throw things away, intrusive thoughts). My Mother (who has the same issues as me) on the other hand, was deeply obsessed with accidentally sinning and lived in constant anxiety. The fact is that she was under grace, and she didn't need to live in constant fear of being damned. 

If you are continuosly troubled about some ""sin"" that no other mature Christians seem to be worried about, there is a very good chance that you are not being led by God."
