If you really want to “get something out of it” then that’s up to you. You have to take 101, then the other 4 upper divs are up to you, so the opportunity to specialize in any particular area of CS is definitely there. 

Now the department blueballs people like you because they don’t have enough CS seats even for the CS majors (honestly an embarrassment if you ask me). If you have a good pick for classes you have a good shot, as most non required CS classes are still open on second pass when non CS majors can enroll. I highly recommend meeting some people in the department to see if they can reserve you a seat in their class if possible (long shot but worth the effort). 

Also you might receive a pushback from the advisors as you will only make the CS over enrollment a bigger nightmare for them, but as long as you take the classes they have no choice to give you the minor as minors are not impacted (as of last year at least)."
