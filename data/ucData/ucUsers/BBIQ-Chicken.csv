formula1,fplxdwl,t1_fpliprq,1588721310.0,People just love to act like Schumacher and Senna were saints. Maybe one day Lewis will be given more credit as it tends to happen when athletes retire and hate wears off.
formula1,fplwzic,t1_fpll3y8,1588721086.0,The way he manages tires is also absolutely incredible. Another thing people don't really credit him for. He often holds off cars at the ends of races with very little tire left. He is so disrespected and I don't think it's all because he cares about the environment or because he's vegan or whatever.
television,fpl0dmu,t1_fpjyrdz,1588704162.0,I disagree with the voice being great. I'm so used to his normal voice that this voice seems like a forced character (like something Michael Scott would do).
formula1,fpkqmp0,t1_fpk9i4y,1588699338.0,Listen to his Behind the Grid podcast. You get some more background on him than DTS.
formuladank,fpiqprr,t1_fph0mci,1588646597.0,And Magnussen actually seems like a lovely guy as well. He's a ruthless bastard on track but it seems like all he wants to do is just fucking race.

thinkpad,fpfjngi,t3_gd68ko,1588573289.0,I accidentally left my T460 in a puddle of water on my table overnight and it is now dead. The red circles match up when the case is on and the little foam standoff was where the rectangle is drawn. There is some red rustic build up but I'm not sure where it came from. Battery looks completely fine.

formuladank,fpdfwl0,t1_fpcnnf6,1588526201.0,That's why I want Lewis to at least get 7.
formula1,fpdekcg,t1_fpcuazf,1588525450.0,"Love how little fucks Zak Brown gives and how much he stands up for his drivers (they are both really good so it's probably not hard). First the Ferrari thing and now this, he's given himself a pretty solid reputation recently."

formula1,fpawoka,t1_fpav052,1588457273.0,He said he wants to do amateur boxing in that bucket list video lol
INDYCAR,fpauxjo,t1_fpanz01,1588456227.0,"He was mostly patronising. From what I saw, they were saying Lando made a stupid move when Pagenaud was taken out. More stuff along the lines of ""this is why you can't with F1 drivers"". ""He's a sim racing wiz"" ""he's a 20yr old and doesn't know anything"".

Edit: I think they said that stuff before talking to Lando"
INDYCAR,fparvgj,t1_fpan2ld,1588454415.0,Says something that the 20 year old is coming out of this looking the most mature after having his lead wiped out. Maybe F1 is doing it right with the semi serious video game GPs. Avoids all of this fucking drama.
INDYCAR,fpap14x,t1_fpane7f,1588452730.0,I'm not an Indycar fan and I don't know these drivers except Ericsson (who I really feel for) but his incredible immaturity was infuriating to watch. You can see him plotting to take out Lando and then from the instant he does it he starts with the excuses. Extremely off-putting.
INDYCAR,fpanvr4,t1_fpam2em,1588452045.0,And dont forget people are gambling on it.

ucr,fp75ek8,t3_gbnvls,1588364370.0,In other words: Wilcox will give out the minimum amount and only because he has to.
formula1,fp5629p,t3_gbccoc,1588317533.0,I'll be sad if Magnussen loses his seat. He's kind of a rare character in F1 nowadays and he really hasn't done much wrong for Haas. He has over a hundred GPs under his belt and that's a respectable career for any driver also considering he never had a great car. If he is forced to leave I'm sure he'll stay out of the spotlight and keep racing something for as long as he can.
formula1,fp54l4x,t1_fp46gez,1588316107.0,"I think his on track tactics are a bit off putting, for example how hard he squeezes on starts. He obviously has developed tricks over the years to get an advantage but as he becomes less successful they become more off putting. But he is delightfully funny and personable off the track."
formula1,fp40ede,t1_fp3lhll,1588289234.0,Seb and Valtteri is the most underrated F1 bromance. Last year after the Mexican GP Seb kept on trying to get Bottas into his interview and Valtteri ended up having to stand there awkwardly the whole time.
teslamotors,fp2kdji,t1_fp2gequ,1588263255.0,He's not an engineer especially at this point. He's a businessman.
MurderedByWords,fp04mjh,t1_fp03z7x,1588202395.0,"You can move the goalposts all you want but political power/influence has nothing to do with cult of personality, worshiping the leader despite wrongdoings does."
MurderedByWords,fp03m4m,t1_fp02ky3,1588201855.0,You must have overlooked the fact that PewDiePie makes a living on an ad supported platform and has sponsors. I don't think Rogan belongs on the list but PewDiePie's following on social media dwarfs Rogan's and Musk's combined.
MurderedByWords,fp01qn0,t1_fozylsj,1588200851.0,"A NASCAR driver just recently got fired for saying the N-word on stream, everybody understandably furious. PewDiePie got boosted by a bunch of teenagers to however many millions of subscribers he has."
MurderedByWords,fozz7jc,t1_fozqjd1,1588199512.0,It's just stupid people being led to believe that a person that is extremely knowledgeable about one thing is just as knowledgeable about everything. Twitter has amplified this manyfold.
DunderMifflin,foxkbaa,t1_foxalhb,1588146694.0,Did you forget about when Wallace brought Michael in to talk to him about what he was doing right in Scranton? Wallace actually knew Michael really well unlike Jo.

toptalent,fosb8z1,t1_forpcdq,1588027349.0,I think it's relevant to point out why actual NBA super athletes can't do this in dunk contests on 10ft hoops even though it is extremely impressive.

formula1,fooysii,t1_foo77pr,1587949342.0,Who was the other one?
formula1,foml1cw,t1_fomkrke,1587894027.0,During the race Max mentioned finding a good compromise in engine modes to minimize the issues as much as possible. And the way he was describing the issues with the car to his engineer were extremely detailed rather than just broken. He's definitely exceptional and not the norm from what I've heard over the radio.
formula1,fomjy4r,t1_fomih5v,1587892840.0,It's funny because throughout the race Max was having problems with his car and was describing very well what was wrong but was pretty much being told to shut up and drive. They clearly have a good relationship.
formula1,fomf8uh,t1_fomewtl,1587887873.0,I noticed that too. When he's off throttle it sounds amazing
formula1,fomekhp,t1_fomecou,1587887189.0,Unbelievable!
formula1,fom9xd3,t1_fom9oi2,1587882747.0,lol It is a bit when you think about everything he has to focus on.
formula1,folhp0r,t1_foj829z,1587862459.0,And his consistency is impressive. I think he could be like Bottas given a good car. Not amazing but consistent and producing results.
formula1,folhlj8,t1_foipij6,1587862400.0,K-Mag mentioned on the Beyond the Grid podcast that Nico still doesn't speak to him when they see each other. So at least one of them held a grudge.

formula1,fo5tvkr,t1_fo4w2mw,1587535530.0,"As an NBA fan what's wrong with NBA social media? They do a lot better than all the other major NA leagues imo. NBA Twitter is probably the biggest Twitter base for a sports league. NBA podcasting is also huge. r/NBA is huge and blows up around playoffs/finals. Players also have much more freedom to express themselves than the NFL and their personalities are much more known than MLB/NHL/NFL. NBA created content isn't really important imo when the players have so much access to social media and there are thousands of media members creating content. News literally breaks instantly on NBA twitter, so much so that it's a form of entertainment itself. I think F1 has a really unique opportunity to use social media just because of the way it's set up. 10 teams 20 drivers with head to head competition. It's literally set up to be a reality show of sorts."

formula1,fo1sj1r,t1_fo18whr,1587440495.0,If the car was not accelerating and there was no drag then the endplate would not move horizontally but Lewis is driving at 310 km/h. So at the very least (underestimating) the impact is at 310 km/h.
formula1,fo1g7s7,t1_fo13s2a,1587432611.0,Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong but the drag forces at 300 kmh are considerable (v^2 ) compared to the accelerational forces on the debris very close to the top speed of Charles' car. If the drag forces outweigh the acceleration force it would be accelerating towards Lewis.
formula1,fo0vy0j,t1_fnztj7o,1587420777.0,Yes. What makes F1 really interesting is the engineering challenge and creativity. Unfortunately it seems to have shifted away from that.
formula1,fo0uvha,t1_fo0qwxn,1587420201.0,I think Charles was thinking about downforce more than safety while his team could see how dangerous it was but only told him to box and provided no other information
formula1,fo0pic6,t1_fo0lnva,1587417369.0,"According to [this](https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a1699336/fia-introduces-new-safety-standards-f1-race-helmets/) article on helmet regulations:

Advanced Ballistic Protection: A 225g metal projectile fired at 250km/h. The peak deceleration shall not exceed 275G.

The endplate roughly would have 12 times the energy compared to the projectile the helmet is supposed to withstand (that's completely ignoring the fact that the endplate and Lewis are accelerating towards each other).  It's impossible to know what factor of safety is engineered in but I doubt any helmet can really mitigate that."
formula1,fo0ljsq,t1_fo0jmt5,1587415305.0,Even if it doesn't penetrate the helmet I think the brain damage from impact at that speed could kill instantly.
formula1,fo0j1t0,t1_fo0hfyj,1587414027.0,The spring that hit Felipe was also considerably lighter than an entire endplate. This could have likely been lethal.
formula1,fo0fy1p,t1_fo0etv6,1587412424.0,"Stewards  definitely deserve some blame. I think Ferrari also intentionally left Charles in the dark and hoped he would continue on by  issuing a weak call for him to pit, this way they could avoid the blame. I'm sure Charles would have boxed if he knew he had an endplate hanging off."
