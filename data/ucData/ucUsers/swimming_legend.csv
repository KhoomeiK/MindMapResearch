The cool thing is that you get so pick your own room so you can see the answers that the person has selected when choosing your spots. 

Another tip: email your roommate sooner rather than later so you can exchange contact information and get to know each other.

Edit: Apparently Housing didn’t do self selection last year...we’ll see what happens this year."

UCSantaBarbara,fn0twn9,t3_fym630,1586548660.0,"I believe that rent should not be refunded, you signed a contract and must abide by it (I know these are unprecedented times, but you are being given the option to stay, it’s not like they are evicting you without refund). They school was not required to cancel housing contracts, like private individuals. But they chose to. 

Now for tuition, we should be refunded what we can’t directly use. Such as the bus fee and rec cen fee. Things that can be done online and are readily available to us in the same capacity I’m okay with paying for (such as caps or CLAS). 

I think, while times are tough for ALL OF US, people try to use this to get money back. I get it, School is expensive and without a paycheck bills add up. But at the end of the day, we are still “choosing” continue our education which is something that we must pay for and have decided it has value. 

Just my thoughts on this."

What I ended up doing is creating another user account called “ProctorU” on my computer. That profile has no access to any files or setting that I use. That way my privacy is (somewhat) maintained. 

If this still doesn’t make you comfortable and you don’t want to use ProctorU, I’d consider taking the course in a different quarter when it can be offered in person."
