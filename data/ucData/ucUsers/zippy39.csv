Unemployment,fpfl46o,t3_g2izp4,1588574621.0,This is happening to me too. I haven't been paid now for almost a month. Do you think they'll pay out the weeks I have had to miss due to this?? I am in the same exact boat. I finally got ahold of someone last week and they said they would call me back.. Still haven't received a phone call.. I'm so frustrated

Unemployment,fohytby,t1_fohwjr7,1587775301.0,Do you know when you can re certify again? Before two weeks of the last pay? After?
