nyu,fp9b9ct,t3_gbos64,1588421113.0,"I think there is always a curve, my CS professor for CSO said the department instructed him to give 1/3 of the class A's, 1/3 B's and 1/3 Cs."
nyu,foeyrwy,t3_g6xa4t,1587719628.0,"1. Yes. There are good professors though, you will have to ask around and go on ratemyprofessor. Also depends on your major. I hear the physics and CBE department is god awful, but CS is OK. 
2. This is true for some classes. I found Math easier at Tandon vs CAS, because at Tandon, math courses emphasize application vs theory. At CAS, if I didn't have a deep understanding of mathematical concepts my ass would be whooped, while at Tandon I could scrape by. Can't speak for science, but my friends say chemistry is much more difficult at CAS.
3. Well, this depends mostly on you, not the school you go to. If you put in the work, you can certainly land internships there.
4. Tandon is a little mediocre, not going to lie. The quality of students and professors at CAS are much higher. But it is what you make of it, there are still opportunities for you to grow and learn. If you are unhappy with the quality of the school you can transfer out."
nyu,foclfzm,t1_focjkns,1587672727.0,"There’s a solid cutoff for Tandon classes no? For linear algebra I remember 90 was an A. CAS is curved so that only 1/3 of the class gets an A, so it’s probably 1/6 that gets an A and not an A-.

Edit: this is still the case, I just found an NYU Tandon calc III syllabus."
nyu,fobvdzq,t1_fobv07p,1587664085.0,"Could be, yea! Not sure about calc I and II because I didn’t take those, but my friends did fine in those classes at Tandon so I assume they weren’t awful. It could also be personal preference, I find application much easier than proofs."
nyu,fob6fx2,t1_foaz8hg,1587656621.0,"Yes, Tandon is strictly engineering. Courant is higher ranked, but at the end of the day your diploma will say NYU so I don’t think it really matters. 

From my experience, my math courses at CAS were a lot more difficult than my math courses at Tandon. I took calculus III in CAS and I looked at my friend’s calculus III exams from Tandon, and it was cake compared to my CAS exams. I wish I had taken it at Tandon, because it was much more straightforward. 

Can’t really speak for other courses though. I did have a friend who took chem I at Tandon and got an A, but after retaking it at CAS she got a B- (she had to retake because they wouldn’t accept chem I credit from Tandon)."

ApplyingToCollege,fnwp924,t1_fnwntab,1587322742.0,"8% is a pretty high transfer out rate, so I don’t think loneliness at NYU is uncommon at all. People say if you’re extroverted, outgoing, and independent, you would be ok. However, I would say I am all these things. I grew up in a big city myself, I am a pretty social person, and I have a lot of friends (or acquaintances). But there are days where I don’t run into anyone I know because NYU is so big. I just wish it felt more like college."
ApplyingToCollege,fnvxl0o,t1_fnvw6oi,1587307109.0,"I think it’s the nature of NYU. It’s not really a campus, more like a collection of buildings in downtown NYC. You will have friends, but you have to make efforts to see them. You will run into classmates/peers on the streets, but you can’t really hang out or chat on the sidewalk. There just isn’t a lot of “common space” where community can be built. On a traditional campus, there are places for this, like grass lawns in schools in California, or the steps of a library. 

It’s hard to spend “down time” with friends. If you reach out to a friend you’re going to do an activity, like studying, eating, shopping. But if you don’t live in the same dorm, there aren’t common places to just chill and hang out. The nights can be lonely if you don’t have friends in your building.

Plus, NYU students tend to be very busy and closed off. This is just my experience though, some people may disagree or have experienced different things. My friends I’ve met at NYU do for the most part agree with this though. 

There is a reason why 8% of NYU students transfer out every year, compared to say, Brown’s 98% freshmen retention rate. NYU can be an amazing experience, but it’s just not for me."

You'll be following track A. There is a course at Tandon that satisfies the statistics course of the minor, which is Data Analysis, part of the mechanical engineering track. I assume you have already finished Calc I/II (or at least will), which is part of the mathematics portion of the minor. There's a decent amount of overlap.

Your professors will be from Stern. I haven't taken classes there before so no idea about the quality, but my friends at Stern say the Stern core classes are pretty chill - Management and Organizations, for instance, was one of my friend's easier classes."

Copying my comment from another thread:

Take this with a grain of salt - I applied for transfer but haven’t heard back yet, although I have friends that successfully transferred to the Ivy League. This is just my personal opinion. But I like to believe I crafted a decent application :)

To transfer, you need a compelling reason that ISN’T “people at my school are dumb” or “I want harder classes”. It’s why a new institution is better suited for your career goals.

For example, perhaps you’re currently studying business. But you discover you love marketing through an internship or student organization. However, your current university doesn’t offer courses specializing in marketing (making shit up because I don’t know anything about the business curriculum). Your story would be “after getting involved with XYZ clubs and ABC extracurriculars, I discovered my passion for business grew to a passion for marketing + business, but this university doesn’t offer many opportunities in this field”.

Then, you go on to say why X university is a better fit, because they have X clubs and X opportunities which supplement your ultimate career goals.

Another thing, if you’re targeting a specific institution, I believe you should try to follow their first year and second year course of study for your intended major.

To summarize, you need to figure out your “niche”, aka your specific reason for transfer. To do this, I’d say get as involved as possible to figure out what you like. Join clubs, get to know your professors, and seize opportunities. When the moment comes, you’ll discover why you want to transfer - not because of prestige, but because it will help you pursue your passions."
