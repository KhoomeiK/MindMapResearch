I am in the process of writing a research proposal for my university about 'binaural beat therapy' to help treat substance abuse/addiction, glad you have found it helpful.  I am currently on day#1 of no THC so I will for sure be trying that to ease my anxious mind and urge to get high/escape. And yes one day at. a. time!!! We got this!"

insomnia,fmdzz1n,t1_fmbke6c,1585983837.0,"I did for a few hours after finally taking Benadryl. But truly not really :(

My chest still feel tight and my breathing is shallow.  I contributed/contribute this to anxiety but I think it is deeper issue.  I have had pneumonia before when I was younger and had be hospitalized but the only symptom I had was shallow breathing and lack of appetite.  I am planning to go to the doctor on Monday but I think this is deeper than anxiety and I think the virus can possible explain why.  I am also quitting smoking weed (which I use for sleep but have always used melatonin or Benadryl to help) but I've done that before and did not suffer from this lack of breath/ ""anxious feelings"". Also I just broke up with my bf since he is traveling for work and his company is not taking social distancing seriously among other reasons). Exercise hasn't helped my sleep deprivation either, I ran and I usually don't go for runs and still nothing. I took a few puffs of an inhaler that my mom keeps stocked for emergencies because my brother had the RSV virus as a baby (had to be put on respirator and was given his Last Rights; also he is one of my triplet brothers so it was weird that we didn't all get the virus). My brother also had respiratory issues during flu seasons often, it was normal for him to take steroids to help)

I don't even drink caffeine either.  Praying for peace soon.

With sleep I know I can get through this, granted I just need relief.  I did reach out the my advising department and the chancellor so they are very aware of what we are going through.

How are you holding up?"
