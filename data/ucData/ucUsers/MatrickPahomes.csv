UCSantaBarbara,fo7w92i,t3_g66vyf,1587585620.0,this sounds a lot like econ 135 and if so i share your pain ðŸ˜•
UCSantaBarbara,fni06rj,t1_fnhrib6,1586971759.0,Thatâ€™s awesome congrats on that. Idk about where iâ€™d go but iâ€™m looking at data science or just a straight mba i really donâ€™t know tho lol
UCSantaBarbara,fnawtnp,t1_fn8vzp8,1586805218.0,Thereâ€™s a weekly forum but that doesnâ€™t really seem to help me at least. Iâ€™m wondering if thereâ€™s a way to opt out of using hw in our final grades or was that just a rumor
UCSantaBarbara,fnawpn8,t1_fn8zvls,1586805162.0,Yea fr iâ€™ve had this TA for another class and he grades strictly. If someoneâ€™s made that group iâ€™d like to know cuz the weekly forum doesnâ€™t help
UCSantaBarbara,fmd8r02,t1_fmcr7q9,1585961889.0,Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m thinking as well. The timing is horrible but we have to make the best of the situation. If you donâ€™t mind where are u going for grad school and what are u studying?
