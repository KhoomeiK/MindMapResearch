MonsterHunterWorld,fo9gp6w,t1_fo9gcei,1587619032.0,"Oh shit I forgot about custom upgrades. And I realized that you can't actually do 3 Safi and MT 😅. Doing 5 Safi with no health augment might be risky  but I've got 3 three coalescence/recovery up jewels so I'm banking on that recovery up to help mitigate Safi damage. And you only need 2 Crit Eye, assuming you use full WEx as well."
