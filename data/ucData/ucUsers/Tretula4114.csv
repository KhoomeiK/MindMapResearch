Residency,fp0xa1r,t3_g9vzz2,1588219010.0,"Hey there! I’m just a college student that randomly stumbled upon here. I’m not sure if my advice would be valid because I’ve never gone through anything you have. I think that you should transfer to the other residency. No matter what, medicine is still just a job, and you’ll have multiple chances to get where you want yourself to be. There’s only ever going to be one of the lovely lady that you have. I would take the chance to just be with her and let yourself be happy. You’ve waited this long right? Go live your best life!"
UCSD,foxt411,t3_ga6hid,1588155358.0,"Honestly, my sleep schedule has been pretty ass ever since spring quarter started. I used to go to sleep around 12:30, but now I go to sleep at around 3:30 or later. probably due to the combination of blue light exposure the entire day with online school as well as a lot of stress and anxiety over things happening in my life that I have absolutely no control over."
UCSD,fnpbjz6,t3_g2whlw,1587142615.0,"I am in the same position right now. I wanted to be productive back in SD obtain more clinical and non-clinical volunteering hours as well as continue doing research in my lab, but it’s obviously not happening lmao. I have some suggestions to still be productive with some of those things remotely. You could volunteer for Crisis Text Line as a counselor to help for different types of crisis intervention. I believe there’s 30 hours of training and you have to volunteer 4 hours a week for a mandatory 200 hours commitment. Another thing I found is UPchieve where you help with online tutoring with disadvantaged youth, but I don’t know much beyond that. I think this depends on your local community and it’s a tad bit more risky, but you could volunteer for Meals on Wheels to help deliver food, especially to the elderly. I think another thing you could do is take online classes over summer session if you have the opportunity. This may seem like a good time to study for the MCAT if you have all your pre-reqs done, but I don’t blame you if you don’t wanna do it lol. Also, I don’t think it’s a complete loss to continue fostering your other interests and hobbies since it’ll help develop yourself too. During these times, I think it’s okay to just accept some loss of opportunities and continue self-care as well as express gratitude for what we have. Hopefully, some of these suggestions helped since we’re all in this together."
UCSD,fnncvco,t1_fnnckcb,1587089478.0,Honestlyyyyy. Maybe they’ll do it winter 2021? The professor is just labeled as staff right now. I’d maybe probably hold off and do another course until then
UCSD,fnnbgxx,t1_fnn9g2d,1587088605.0,"I haven’t had Ulka, but I’ve seen and heard of so many people complain about her on Reddit and other places. My friend also has her for BILD 2 for the summer, and I kinda pray she doesn’t make that a complete shit show too. Just seeing all the bad stuff makes me not want to take her, but I’m also curious if people are wrong about her."
UCSD,fnnazon,t1_fnn2e17,1587088298.0,"Ok thank you for your help! I didn’t take the BILD series either, so I’m afraid of overloading myself with bio courses since I don’t remember anything. I think I have a decent, but not in depth neuro background from taking PSYC 2 and doing work for my lab. My plan was to do BIBC 102 with Hampton and maybeee BIPN 140 with Spitzer in the fall. Do BIPN 100 with Bloodgood in the winter. Do BICD 110 with Forbes and BIMM 100 with Pruneda-Paz in the spring. I’m not sure if this is ideal since I’m leaving a decent amount of lab classes and electives to be done for my last year."
UCSD,fnmr1sl,t1_fnmi4w0,1587076525.0,"Thank you for the help! I was thinking of going for an emphasis in neuro too, and I’m wondering if you’ve taken BIPN 140 since the professors for that class are good in the fall?"
UCSD,fnmpirv,t1_fnmka36,1587075707.0,Tell me how it goes! I really don’t want to take her if she’s the professor consistently teaching BIPN 102 (;-;)
UCSD,fn70vac,t1_fn60xu4,1586711117.0,"I have 40C with Hoeger. I think the session was pretty alright. It helped review a little bit of stuff for the class. I think the problem with it was the amount of time we were stuck in break out rooms, so we weren’t able to finish as many problems."
UCSD,fn1a6q7,t3_fyjpui,1586557861.0,I’ve been going to my SI session for CHEM 40C. There was a really large turnout despite the whole thing being online. There were over 50 people who attended my session. I think you should still go and do whatever you can to assist in your learning! Don’t let these barriers and the awkwardness of online education affect you :)
UCSD,fmd558q,t3_fuggh2,1585959545.0,"I’ve been doing pretty shit honestly. I like how online classes are giving me a lot of flexibility with my day, and I have been at least a week ahead on work and manage to work out every other day. However, I have been feeling really depressed constantly staying at home with controlling parents. I haven’t really gone outside to breathe fresh air for the last two weeks. I miss working in my lab and all of my friends from college. I never really have something to look forward to at the end of the week anymore. All I do is just sleep and school work. The most I look forward to doing is eating and sleeping nowadays :/"
