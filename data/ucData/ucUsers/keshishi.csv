UCI,fpap7m6,t1_fpaoxx1,1588452835.0,"I think thats because the new only kicks in later, the first 30 or so slots are open then it becomes new only. So if you can grab a spot beforehand you should be fine.

But I wouldn’t worry too much, the class is given every quarter and is pretty easy so it can fit in pretty much any schedule."
UCI,fpaoe37,t3_gcdigz,1588452348.0,33 will probably have slots but 43 usually fills up as its reserved for new only

If you actually read the article it is democratic to have 3% of the student body recall a senator. 

>In order to be recalled by a petition from the student body under the [current constitution](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/asuci_constitution_final.pdf),  a petition requires, “Ten percent of the votes cast in the last regular  election for that office, in the case of Executive Officers, At ­Large  and Special Interest Senators, and the Student Advocate General,” or “25  percent of the votes cast in the last regular election for that office,  in the case of School­ based Senators”

Therefore, only 32 people voted for the pharmsci senators.

You think that if 32 people voted for the pharm sci senator 3,000 people should have to sign the petition? GTFOH"
