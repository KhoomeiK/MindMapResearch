That doesn't change the fact that those 80% of Canadians have political power and can use that power to do things that the 20% might not like. Isn't that simply the reality of living in a republic?"

It's the most beautiful building in the WORLD!"

ucla,flyv2nn,t3_fs0gko,1585609692.0,"Not a perfect student, but I almost always get A's and B's and currently have a 3.5 GPA. I don't know if there's any one trick that really helps, but for me I really like to be really ""hands-on"", if that makes any sense. My favorite study materials are practice exams, homework problems — basically anything that requires me to actually apply knowledge instead of just reading the textbook or skimming over slides. I tend to not care about material if I don't think it's gonna be relevant for actually solving a problem that I could get on a test.

I like practice problems so much that sometimes I'll even go straight to them before reading the material, and only reference the material if I need it to actually solve the problem. I think most people would probably do it the other way around — study a bunch of material and then try to solve the problem. This is just my personal approach — not saying it'll be perfect for you. Everyone learns differently.

Also, try not to worry about GPA too much right now, since you're only 2 quarters in. If you do well in future quarters, that can really change for the better. GPA is more of a marathon than a sprint."
