todayilearned,fpj45yd,t1_fpir4jc,1588656085.0,I‚Äôve heard of them sleeping in weird phases but hearing it phrased like ‚Äúnever truly woken up‚Äù is very unique. Thanks for sharing that little detail
PoliticalCompass,fpj3z8a,t1_fpj3qww,1588655935.0,I hardly see this as a scientific study. This is more similar to those online personality tests which are only moderately accurate. The point is more if you get close to 100% you might be racist. There are far better ways to measure racist perceptions such as the one where you quickly press left or right when you see faces flash on the screen and answer questions about how they made you feel.
PoliticalCompass,fpj2lji,t1_fpizzzf,1588654848.0,I think the question lacked nuance. The point is are you asking them because you know they are skilled at it or because you‚Äôre assuming they‚Äôre skilled due to their ethnicity?

One time my parents took us to SF for my mom‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs wedding. We made a trip out of it and did a lot of cool stuff during the day, then my brother and I hung out and watched movies in the hotel room.
