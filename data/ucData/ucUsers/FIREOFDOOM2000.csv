LeftWingMaleAdvocates,foz9wsi,t1_foz7dt5,1588187123.0,"That ship has sailed a while ago, I’m in college now, personally high school was one of the more miserable times of my life as it seemed that the schooling system was designed to fail ppl and just be a buerocratic nightmare. Teachers routinely loosing homework or being incompetent results in the students getting in trouble. We had a calc test on the wrong chapter and our teacher said to do it anyways. Surprise surprise class average was an F, but we all got a lecture about how bad and unmotivated we are and told off for trying to sabotage her standing (don’t know how that logic works but she was basically yelling all class). She also refused to give a makeup test to classmate that was stuck in the hospital with a concussion (man was passed out cold I believe from an accident), when he came back a couple weeks later she said no, then she asked for proof and a doctors note, tried to call the doctor and when she got told off for trying to pry into a private case she got mad at the student. Student started arguing back with her and they went at it for a while before she called the admin saying he was throwing chairs and threatening ppl. He walked all the way to the admin office while she was saying that he was causing disruptions despite not being in the room. The best part was that he still got in trouble despite being in the room with the principal for causing a disruption in a class he wasn’t physically in. Then there’s the fact that the principal called me and some of my table mates to spin a story that he threw a chair, when we said that he didn’t do that he got angry........... this was ~2015-2018........... personally I think high school teachers and admin are a miserable bunch overall, way to much favoring and back scratching. I’ve had only a handful of good high school teachers and ironically enough my college profs have been more communicative, reasonable, professional and fair which is nuts in a class size of almost 300 sometimes. On the bright side that math teacher did get labeled an anti Semite because the student was Jewish and was open about his faith, and another Jewish student bailed out of the class into a different class 2 weeks in the first semester (undeserved most probably but it was karma and most ppl were okay with it because of how mean she was, it’s a self repeating cycle now where she’s just known as the anti semetic one instead of the “less colorful language one”. My sibling and friends sibling still know her as that despite the fact that our grade graduated while they were in freshman or entering freshman year which is funny to me) All this was one occasion btw, we had one emotionally unstable English lit teacher who would constantly cry in our first period class and have emotional outbursts (a student left her class midway through the semester and it got even worse because her ego was bruised hard after that)"

ShitWehraboosSay,foxo5yt,t1_foxmcge,1588150375.0,"Nazi germany was fighting for the expansion of German land and ethnic cleansing. That’s why we call the soldiers nazis because they actively worked towards a goal in line with the majority party and ideals of said elected leader and general consensus of the country. As for the Russians I’ll be honest, I haven’t heard many people call them Soviet soldiers when discussing them casually. The only times I see soviet soldiers is in research or historical analytical papers and even then it’s not sure fire. But it’s fine to call them soviets for two reasons, the name of the country was literally called the Soviet Union/USSR, and two the dominant unifying ideology at the time was the soviet ideology, there weren’t as many competing ideologies in a popular enough setting to compete against the general ideas of the soviet party enough to separate it into another political party all together. As for the Americans and to an extent the British no, we can’t use the political classification because all though the political party was elected, the ppl and soldiers are simply way to diverse to label them soldiers of a political nature. As a whole American weren’t as unified on a political party or view as say the Russians or Germans or Japanese. The political parties in the US and UK aren’t set in stone and their ideals aren’t set in stone and dictated by a huge concentration of political power at the center. For Americans and the British along with the French, and other western non axis countries, political parties varied across political lines and they weren’t the dominant ideological force, whereas in Germany the dominant ideological force was facism with Nazi views and the soviet ideology in the USSR which was long standing in its views and didn’t change till much later with glassnost and perestroika (I butchered the spelling I know). For America France and the Uk (top of my head) the political heading of the power can change every couple years and so does the countries goals, however the same cannot generally be said of that of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, DPRK, and PRC. What I’m trying to get at here is that some countries are so entrenched in their political ideology and forefathers visions, they don’t stray to far from them on the surface level (I am aware there were political differences in both Nazi germany and the Soviet Union, however they were just different flavors and takes on the same overall ideology, otherwise said political differences would manifest into a separate ideological party if they were critically different). Public policy of America and the UK can change a lot (yes I am aware of how the us is very interventionist in its history, but it’s method of doing so has changed greatly with differing presidents and differing time periods), thus the countries ideological and political systems remain the same for the most part and can be characterized by the dominant philosophy of the nation. In the US atleast (I’m not British or French  so I can’t attest to this for them as much as I can America), the political landscape is constantly changing ( i know we have a two party system, but even then things are different look at how bush and trump did things differently despite both being republicans, or Bill Clinton and Obama despite being both Democrats (this one is more of a stretch since Clinton wasn’t your traditional democrat but they are closer together than Obama and someone else from the way back), their political philosophy and methods of actions on the international stage differed and weren’t as homogenous as say the nazis or the Soviet Union and China till the late 70s/80s). 

TLDR: Soviet and nazis soldiers because those parties stay in power for a long time and they represent the dominant view point during said long time of the country, America has a constantly changing political landscape (even in the two party system, presidents differ in their actions and goals when faced with similar problems) that is based on the current 4 year term of the president. Republicans aren’t the dominant political power of America for the next 80 years as such we don’t call American soldiers republican soldiers"

One thing is for sure, for all the shit we give Ubisoft, gaijin makes their balancing decisions look perfect and makes siege ‘s fundamental issues not as bad as this game at certain times. I decided to come to this game after being burnt out by siege and playing it semi competitively and tried to pick up WT back again (I started way back before they changed the research model to researching a vehicle one at a time, and stopped right before the post ww2 tank were added). And I have to say, so far I’m not impressed. I’m already loosing money and making way less than I used to, and the cross map spawn peeks are annoying on certain maps. The BRs seem even more compressed at times which I didn’t think was possible and some maps still aren’t fixed (Russian port where you can camp enemy spawn with a short drive). The grind is also nuts. Overall tanks is where I go to gamble on the fact I might have fun and make some money, planes is where I go to make money have have some nostalgic fun but that’s about it. I don’t know what it is but I kinda just lost the sparkle I had with this game. I’m currently playing it because there’s no other game like this with its mechanics on the market which is sad because I genuinely enjoyed the game in its older state despite its own problems back then. So far it just feels stuffy, I guess that’s just the way it seems after coming back from a long time."

Until the roommate starts contributing financially she can expect nothing. Further more if we move the kid to the moms “place” couldn’t the father turn around and say he misses the kid like ppl insinuated the mom did then he can ask for the kid to come back and uh oh we have a scheduling issue and the kid is going back and forth back and forth in the middle of stay at home orders........... the kid is going to be fine, it’s not like mom is long gone forever"

DestroyedTanks,fn48qqa,t1_fn3uscc,1586636356.0,Post war studies detmerined that cas wasn’t as big of a deal as it seems to tanks and heavy armor when it came to destruction. They menaced logistical units but they more so stalled tank columns and tanks rather than taking them out in a fashion like the highway of death from the Iraq war
DestroyedTanks,fn48evv,t1_fn3zaya,1586636165.0,"K couple of things, a tank is multi faceted. Armor isn’t the be all end all of a tank. The Americans could produce a lot of Shermans, but the crew couldn’t be. The armors physical rating (aside from the fact that later Shermans had effective armor of that if tigers and maybe panthers I believe), is designed to keep the crew safe and prolong the use of a tank in the field for fighting a war. The Sherman protected its crew, and while it wasn’t the most heavily armoured beast out there, it’s design allowed it to be repaired more easily and brought back into the field faster, effectively keeping the crew alive and allowing the tank to be seen more in the field than say other tanks like a tiger or panther D. What this means is that the us army even when taking losses could still keep more armor on the field and have a larger effective tank fighting force across the front than the Germans. German armor on their tanks could tank shells true (not necessarily true by late war save for a few tanks), being disabled was a death sentence, and actually being hit was close to a death sentence. Turn over rates for field repairs for damaged or disabled German tanks wasn’t like the allied ratios. Which means that despite all that armor, if the tank was disabled it was useless more often than not because it couldn’t be repaired or brought back or that the crew would be fried, what does this all mean? Sure the effective armor on German cats was larger but it didn’t pro long the tanks service life by much effectively in the war when one takes into consideration the battlefield. Overall more shermans could be on the field and be more effective than German tanks in the overall war because they could be repaired quickly and protect their crew and offer higher survival rates. Secondly comparing a medium tank to a heavy tank is fucking stupid, but even so the fact that said medium tank can compete against said heavy tank and have an affect on the battlefield is more of a negative for said heavy tank (US doctrine was to have TDs do tank combat while the mediums support the push and armoured advance). Tanks are built to be breakthrough machines in wars mostly, sure they can fill other roles but no one builds a tank and says it’s not going to be used on the offensive. We judge tanks by their effectiveness, and despite high kill counts for big German cats, their overall operational performance didn’t do much to change the war or battlefields. Shermans were still having a larger overall impact throughout the war. Judging tanks in a pure vaccum is how we get ppl saying that the tiger2 was the best tank of ww2 because big armor and gun. As for arracourt once again a tank is more than its armor and gun. Yes German defenses weren’t the best in the world, but to act like the German tank crews were bumbling idiots who all of a sudden forgot how tanks work is disengious. The Americans were able to use their tanks overall abilities to their strengths. Unlike the big cats they could move more fluidly, keep their crew safer when hit AND still kill their opponents. People act as if the 75 couldn’t do anything to the German tanks, except it can, has and you don’t need to kill a tank to win the engagement. Just disable it so that it’s not combat capable. A tiger or panther is useless when tracked or when it’s gun is destroyed or when it’s transmission is destroyed. Just because the American tankers using their overall more well balanced tank to accomplish goals doesn’t mean that the tankers skill outshined their veichles. If we took away the Shermans and replaced them with an M2 or an Lee I doubt we’d have the same outcome at arracourt with the same crews. The tankers were able to exploit their well balanced tanks compared to that of their counterparts who excelled in specific circumstances. After all a tank is a break through machine that can fill other roles, if it’s so one dimensional on the battlefield it’s going to get destroyed by other tanks that on paper seem less than it on first glance. I’m sorry but past the panzer 4s and some note worthy panthers the German tanks were not good tanks in the logistics and economics of war overall, if you want to place two tanks and say fight in a vaccum to determine which is better go for it, but that doesn’t determine which tank was better for a war or which tank will have a bigger effect on the battlefield and in logistics."
