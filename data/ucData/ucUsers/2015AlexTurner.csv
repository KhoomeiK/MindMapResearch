TheStrokes,fn6w7x5,t1_fn6ttyr,1586708559.0,The way I did it is to go on a desktop version of reddit and there’ll be a sidebar on the right side of the r/thestrokes page. There should be an option for flairs and you can pick whatever you like! Hope that helps 😊

ucla,fmxckso,t1_fmxbi8p,1586462491.0,"I’ve called the financial aid office half a dozen times in the last month I’d say. I ask them if I can have some sort of extension and I’m told to contact the student accounts department. I took all the advice from my last post and contacted the registrar’s as well; however, they aren’t accepting calls at this time. So email is my only choice for contacting them. 

That’s good to know. Thank you."
ucla,fmxazyh,t1_fmxarya,1586461681.0,That’s why I mentioned to read my previous two posts. I just don’t know what to do at this point and am trying to see if anyone has any other ideas I can do to help me.
ucla,fmxadr0,t1_fmx8gej,1586461365.0,I’ve been in the process of readmission since late January. I’ve asked my counselor and finaid advisors about receiving aid. They said that yes I can. I. Asked how long   It would take. They. Said around the time spring aid would be disbursed. My. Classes will. Be dropped tomorrow and it’s possible my financial aid file hasn’t. Even been looked at. I wouldn’t mind them taking long if my classes weren’t going to be dropped. There’s no   Guarantee I’ll. Get my classes back and I’ll be even more behind. I think I have the right to be upset.

ucla,fmtu8dw,t1_fmttak4,1586379098.0,"I totally feel you! Especially with the pandemic going on rn, everything is closed so you have to resort to just emailing and calling. And even then, some departments aren’t accepting calls! It feels like I’m yelling into the void"
ucla,fmtgm0p,t1_fmtfk6l,1586372370.0,"I have been talking to them for the last three months. I called today and was told it’s possible that my file is still in queue and hasn’t even been looked at yet :( 

I’ve asked to have two urgent emails sent (over the last month) to the counselor reviewing my file and Friday’s deadline is still knocking. 

I sent an email to student accounts to request an extension and have yet to hear back from them. I’m at a complete loss, but thank you for the advice 🙂"
