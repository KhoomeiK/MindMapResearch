When your currency is devalued, let's say against the dollar, then one BossBuck (BB) buys less Dollars than before. So say, initially, 10 BB = 1 USD. Now you devalued it, and 20 BB = 1 USD. This will allow whoever is using USD to buy more of your goods, and make your goods attractive. Will also increase the prices of imports, boosting your domestic businesses because imported goods (assuming imported goods are bought using USD) are now more expensive than domestic goods. 

When your currency is inflated, that means your BB is buying fewer goods than before. Initially, 5 BB = 1 Big Mac, but after inflation 7 BB = 1 Big Mac. Inflation is actually a result of everyone becoming richer, and having more BB; if you knew your customers had more money, you'd undoubtedly try to charge more."
