Ok, let's say they tell you they announce something May 20. They are confident to sort everything out until then. Shortly before the state announces something that changes the overall situation. Now their plan doesn't work any more. 

They can either cancel that announcement and you'll complain that there was no announcement. Or they do the announcement and tell you they don't have a plan, and you complain that they don't have a plan. Or they just don't announce an announcement at all, you'll still complain but they don't have all that added stress and drama and can just come out with information once it's ready.

Going up from 1 to 4 is much harder than from 4 to 16. Once you got multi-threading implemented (which we already got) it's an optimization task to let it use more cores, not a complete architectural change. This is much faster to implement than it was before, and it's already done.

>The Goldwater rule basically states that a public person cannot be professionally diagnosed until they are seen by a licensed professional in person.

Rules usually have exceptions, don't they? Is it really not possible to do so, at least in a rough way, if you got hundreds of hours of video material and far more than 10000 tweets?"
