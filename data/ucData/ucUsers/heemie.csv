BlackHair,fotc85b,t3_g9d568,1588049826.0,"Also I noticed when I drink tons of water take vitamins my hair grows fast and thick. My hair was like yours , I thought it wasn’t growing  for a long time. Last year I started drinking tons of water/la croix and got vitamins (gummy general vitamins, lol) and the picture from this year my hair is so thick and much longer. It is actually noticeable even with shrinkage:-) edit: I think we are like plants.. we just need water sunlight and nutrients lol"

childfree,fmhe1me,t1_fmgl09a,1586076301.0,Same introvert! Usually I’m the weird one at parties bonding with the cat in the corner when all the extroverts are getting too hype and I need to calm down. :-D. Introverts unite in our own homes for the moment... but probably not much has changed....lol
