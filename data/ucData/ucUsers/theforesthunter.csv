Just cos even if the class doesn't have the same curve system as previous semesters (set the mean to a B+), the class historically is always around a B/B+ so hopefully they'll keep it that way this semester."
berkeley,fp4zd4y,t1_fp3u5jh,1588311527.0,"As someone who's taken both, 70 will eat up your life but it's a lot more fun, and there's more resources to learn the materials than there was in 55 (ok maybe there's SLC adjunct for 55, but they didn't have that my semester?). I didn't know I wanted to major in CS when I took 55, so I feel like I've wasted a bit of time taking both. If you care about gpa, do 55, if not, take 70."
berkeley,foxedpi,t3_ga33a7,1588141451.0,"I feel you, discrete math was chill but every single time I've done probability in the past (and now) it's been my absolute nemesis. I'm sort of (sort of) getting the hang of it but some of these problems (esp the ones with extensive trig? Lol like what is a cosine I forget) are a mind fuck."

I hear the projects you can do them in a day?"
berkeley,fo3b0ct,t1_fo2bz3e,1587483797.0,"Oh I see... my previous physics classes didnâ€™t cover circuits too thoroughly, though I did learn the absolute fundamentals. Iâ€™m thinking of taking 169 over the summer and maybe auditing EE 16A by just showing up to lectures and doing whatever assignments I have access to on the class page. Iâ€™m hoping this will be enough? 

Also - thanks for all your input so far! What you said is really helpful :)"
berkeley,fo27mtl,t1_fo1zeia,1587452336.0,Yeah... are circuits like... self study-able though? I know thereâ€™s super long labs in 16A where you have little computery things and wires and stuff
berkeley,fo1srmt,t1_fo1s9pq,1587440657.0,Oh in that case I wonâ€™t do that then LOL thank you
berkeley,fjodq97,t1_fjmpwzi,1583525703.0,thatâ€™s so extra lmao ðŸ™„
