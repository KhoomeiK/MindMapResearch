ucla,fpi76zr,t1_fphz05r,1588635035.0,I wasn't going to vote until I saw USAC's email basically flaming Orion
programming,fot9tjr,t1_fosqpsu,1588048052.0,I think neuromorphic computing chips are helping with this but it's still a long way off. Basically you can do ODEs with tunable analog circuits and all for weights which makes it much faster but I really don't know anything about it.
programming,fot7e07,t1_fosiehs,1588046338.0,"Is getting caught in a local optima something that needs to be accounted? I was under the impression that usually the it's in a high-enough dimensional space for that not to be an issue (I've studied and dealt with this stuff for CV stuff, idk what it's like for lower dimensional data)."
programming,fos87zm,t1_forweeg,1588025749.0,It basically demonstrates that it can model a non-linear function. Being able to do this is one of the things that makes NNs so much more robust (here meaning that they can model many more functions) than basic linear differentiators

ECE,fogrzda,t1_fo0uw8x,1587756308.0,Oh shoot considering that and post was deleted it may have been
ECE,fo4tz50,t3_g4tgqa,1587511164.0,use the nyquist-shannon sampling theorem
running,fnu91ny,t3_g3wjue,1587257054.0,I think it helps to view running as an act of discipline and not necessarily as something that has to be enjoyed.

running,fnen3kl,t3_g1ac3c,1586892309.0,"1) I think it's fine to do long runs at a slower cadence. Running slower naturally leads to slower cadence. That being said I've personally found that focusing on form/faster cadence on easy runs has helped increase my overall cadence.

2/3) I think HR is more important. You're form should be good irregardless of pace (ie no forefoot strike, stepping below body). You're not going to get high heel pickup unless you run at a fast pace. For me I don't get high heel pickup unless I do my long runs at <6:30 mpm

4) I think you're overthinking this honestly. Just run based on feel and use HR as for rough guidance. Focus on form/faster cadence on easy runs and it should naturally improve on long runs.

I think you should repost this in advancedrunning. I've read some of Daniel's, but if you're taking training this seriously/analytically that's probably a better sub for it."
LosAngeles,fned5mq,t3_g193b1,1586887237.0,Aren't the trails closed? Ik plenty of ways in without the tape or fences too but I thought we were trying to stay off anyways
AdvancedRunning,fnbwa9w,t3_g0nw15,1586823587.0,Check out declinated calf raises. I have chronic Achilles tendonitis issues that I only keep at bay by doing 100-200/day every day even after the pain has left.
ucla,fmt78cd,t3_fx6ynu,1586367976.0,It doesn't work for me either
ECE,fmbv7a8,t3_fu5mb6,1585933818.0,"You already asked this same question a week ago in the sub and got lots of good answers. You're an adult. Consider that you'll be graduating in a recovering, weak economy and that parents and ones own jobs can be at risk rn when spending that kind of money.

To answer your question, I don't think USC EE is good enough for that kind of money. UCSB is in a similar tier to UIUC if a bit lower."
