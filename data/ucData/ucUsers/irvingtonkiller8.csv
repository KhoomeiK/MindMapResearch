I stay with TSM cuz I‚Äôm a TSM fan before a league fan. I watch their games cuz I care for the roster and the players and specifically Bjerg, I don‚Äôt give a shit about c9 sadly and I won‚Äôt watch their games because I simply have no attachment to them. It‚Äôs not hard to understand, it‚Äôs not some ‚Äúwhacko reality‚Äù. Why does everything have to be about ‚Äúgood‚Äù league of legends?
