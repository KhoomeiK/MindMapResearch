ucr,fpf96su,t1_fpevk6v,1588564837.0,thank u!! i think if my professor continues to do that ill look into it
ucr,fpf94te,t1_fpepy0f,1588564800.0,yeah i mean i guess that is a positive way to think about it thanks! idk i think itâ€™s also a me thing where i have literally the shittiest attention span so i like to only take 50 min lectures if i can so going above 50 min or like an hour im just not gonna pay attention
ucr,fpf8sqq,t1_fpeejgf,1588564566.0,idk itâ€™s not rlly the extra time that bothers me itâ€™s like weâ€™re expecting to follow the same rules as irl school like not using google during exams and taking them ourselves and stuff so they shud do their job to keep it the same as much as they can. and if they wrre able to do it within the 50 minute time period before they shud continue to do that now
ucr,fpf8kul,t1_fpe6d47,1588564413.0,THANK U THIS IS SO NICE but ya it rlly pissed me off that all my professors think i have all the time in the world to just listen to them like i have 3 other classes to do work for ah but thatâ€™s nuce of ur teachers to be cooperative:)
ucr,fpf8hn8,t1_fpe1o8a,1588564350.0,ya thatâ€™s annoying af if we have to send in hw bya certain time they shud do their hw by a certain time too
ucr,fpf8drk,t1_fpe1tp7,1588564276.0,LOL ya i watch some of my english ones on 2x speed but if i tried to do that for bio my fingers would die trying to type that fast ðŸ˜­
ucr,fpbvkv8,t3_gcj9l4,1588479860.0,no dude i feel you i hate when we do breakout rooms in chem im literally so lost as it is but literally all i do is say hello to see if anyone responds but if they dont i just go on my phone cuz i have no idea how to answer the questions myself. i hate it itâ€™s a waste of time ðŸ˜­
ucr,fp3z4bk,t3_gb0tz0,1588288535.0,idk honestly i feel like it might because ik schools like harvard and another school in boston said theyre not going to start in person until 2021 and i think many schools will start following the same thing because if they open schools itâ€™s like an extra liability for them because they have to make sure crowds arent forming and stuff like that. it would just be bad rep for something like a corona outbreak to happen on their campus for ex and itâ€™s way worse in socal than it is in norcal (where im from rn) Ive heard from my mom who works in a hospital that even if cases do go down this summer since corona behaves similar to the flu cases will start to increase when it gets colder like around sept-nov but the idea of hybrid classes might mean that we do go back to school soon but realistically I feel like until there is a vaccine formed schools wont reopen for fall 2020 at least which rlly sucks and im not abt it :/
