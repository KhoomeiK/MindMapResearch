magicTCG,fpmsb7f,t3_ge2c9d,1588740403.0,"If you're a casual player, the broken mechanics should affect you too much. Most of the people complaining about the companion mechanic are competitive players. To me, this is reasonable because the mechanic has kind of crapped up most competitive formats."
TheLastAirbender,fpkp016,t1_fpknrg7,1588698535.0,I think there's a lot of evidence for this being the intention. Mainly the speech the twins give in the beginning of the episode
LifeProTips,fpeacw3,t3_gcupnk,1588543545.0,yup. My sister and I basically both agree that there is no moral quandary when we are forced to lie.
UCSantaBarbara,fpdfugr,t1_fpdbzw7,1588526169.0,The beaches along the Santa Barbara coast are actually allowed to stay open. The mayor made a deal with Newsom.
UCSantaBarbara,fpc3lm4,t1_fpc249z,1588486503.0,Fair enough.
UCSantaBarbara,fpc30zn,t1_fpc2pwu,1588485989.0,"The virus actually can survive in sunlight and humidity. [This](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/nepal-documents/novel-coronavirus/un-rumour-tracking-english-issue-2.pdf?sfvrsn=bd68b830_2#:~:text=From%20the%20evidence%20so%20far,mouth%2C%20and%20nose.) is from the WHO: ""From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. [...] Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on
surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface,
temperature or humidity of the environment). However, there is no evidence that sun light kills the new
coronavirus."""
UCSantaBarbara,fpc18cb,t1_fpc0omu,1588484412.0,"You're mostly right, I don't blame people for having to walk past me to get down the beach if I'm standing around. But I'd say in this particular case, the group of people had a choice to be much more considerate."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbznrp,t1_fpbwqdv,1588483074.0,"Is there a rule that you shouldn't? Honest question, because I see people hanging out and watching the water and taking pictures all the time, so I thought it was okay."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbzflt,t1_fpbycnf,1588482885.0,"Even if it were, all they had to do was tell me they were coming so I could get out in time. Instead, they saw me stuck between the waves and them and started coming down without saying anything. I asked them to back up before coming down so I could get out, but they literally told me ""It's too late"" and forced me to expose myself to them. I was really disgusted and honestly felt violated."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbu3o3,t1_fpbt42z,1588478758.0,"It doesn't matter if you are at risk or not, you should still be social distancing. First of all, it's become clear that even if you aren't ""at risk"" you can still die from the disease readily. Second, every single additional person who catches the disease increases the risk of someone needing to go to the hospital, which increases the strain on our hospital system, which leads to more deaths. It's a snowball effect that is prevented by stopping the spread as much as we possibly can."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbqdbu,t1_fpbotud,1588476107.0,"I actually think this is a fair point. While I don't know if taking any steps towards walking back on stay at home orders are where we should be, I think it's really important that each government does what it can to negate as much economic damage as possible. I'm actually kind of terrified of what the fallout of an extended quarantine will be on poor people and small businesses."
UCSantaBarbara,fpboivf,t1_fpbnsow,1588474819.0,What's your logic?
UCSantaBarbara,fpbh9w6,t1_fpbh4op,1588469978.0,"You're supposed to social distance with those you live with. So yes, socializing with the people you're already constantly exposed to is okay, but what I saw was dozens of people partying and hanging out on the beach together. Were some of these groups housemates? Probably. But all of them? Definitely not."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbgpm9,t1_fpbdzbe,1588469605.0,I was watching the ocean yesterday standing on the steps down to the ocean and a huge group of people started carrying a float down the steps and basically implied that I should squeeze around them. I was fucking speechless.
UCSantaBarbara,fpbfq82,t1_fpbenrq,1588468959.0,Okay
UCSantaBarbara,fpbenyr,t1_fpbeien,1588468264.0,"Yeah, sexual harassment is pretty funny"
UCSantaBarbara,fpbdbdg,t1_fpbcu1k,1588467402.0,What do you mean?
UCSantaBarbara,fpbcmb4,t1_fpb9l0m,1588466962.0,"Making an ad hominem argument is attacking a person instead of refuting the argument they are presenting. It's known to be a logical fallacy. They're implying that no one is actually refuting their argument, but insulting them instead."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbcgzc,t1_fpb9ikl,1588466870.0,"I don't think they were trying to be aggressive, just pointing out that my post is more of a rhetorical question than an actual proposition for discussion."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbbyl3,t1_fpbawkq,1588466550.0,Link your data please?
UCSantaBarbara,fpb6vd0,t1_fpb6kdq,1588463364.0,"I'm mostly hoping that the people who are being careless will see a post like this and come to their senses. I'm pretty sure I'm not crazy, but I guess if there was something I didn't know or didn't understand, I'd love to be educated? Maybe all the people going outside found out they're superhumans?"
UCSantaBarbara,fpb6f4l,t1_fpb63ge,1588463088.0,"Tell that to the dozens of thousands of doctors and nurses who are fighting for the lives of their patients and their own lives every day. Tell that to the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost loved ones: not just people who were at risk, but also people who were completely healthy before getting sick with COVID and dying."
UCSantaBarbara,fpb4eje,t1_fp4l5r9,1588461875.0,Not a reason nor an excuse
UCSantaBarbara,fp11t7h,t3_gaoe3v,1588222135.0,It continuously shocks and disappoints me how regressive some of the students here are.
AskReddit,fozinly,t1_foz19xw,1588191299.0,This movie has 56% on rotten tomatoes? Critics seemed to dislike it
AskReddit,fozi6k0,t1_foykxsa,1588191070.0,This movie is generally recognized to be terrible
magicTCG,fo2akb5,t3_g54gy4,1587455190.0,"I wish I had the resources/time to tune a deck with such detail as you clearly have. It's so awesome to see work like this being done on obscure decks. Magic is more fun with people brewing new things, but especially with people lovingly crafting their creations into the best possible iterations."
asktransgender,fnvcbei,t3_g3ye1m,1587287915.0,My friend is afab enby and is fine being somewhat femme right now but wants to be a man when they're elderly. Pretty similar I think? I asked why and that's just how they see themself.
AskMen,fnp9ohq,t3_g31boh,1587141676.0,You are using commas very incorrectly. https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma/
MovieDetails,fmicb18,t3_fvdx93,1586106728.0,The screenplay also has them written this way. It's great.
