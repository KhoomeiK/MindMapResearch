UCI,fmx93bq,t1_fmvdr7g,1586460694.0,Yeah definitely wild sometimes. I am a cs student and had the pleasure of being in the documentary. It’s crazy how I just start to recognize other black people without ever meeting them. When the trailer was released for this documentary and I saw some of the other students being interviewed I just knew them. “Oh that was my bus driver”. “Oh when I passed by engineering after my class I always see that person”. “Oh he was that tour guide I saw one time.” We kinda just stick out.
