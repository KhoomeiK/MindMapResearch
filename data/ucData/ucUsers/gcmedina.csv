ucr,fp8k7w7,t3_gbzdgw,1588394496.0,FACTS

ucr,fowxbfh,t3_g9uk7e,1588129167.0,If you’re in the LA county and need a place to study/do homework hmu. I’m an only child LOL so there’s plenty of room at home :). Best of luck though!
shameless,fow1479,t1_fovpijp,1588111090.0,They were good and bad for each other. I loved them

ucr,fobvkq3,t3_g6ljnu,1587664147.0,"I commute from LA. I’m from the 91746 area. I just take the 60 lol. It takes me about 45-hr to get there. It’s not that bad, just make a killer playlist ! Best of luck :)"
ucr,fnqwy7n,t1_fnqvn2x,1587174042.0,Honestly! Who knows what we did wrong lol because many did pretty good
ucr,fnquuvm,t1_fnquo13,1587172725.0,"If you consider the midterm he gave us today, that hour+ he spent review was pointless."
ucr,fnqubg0,t1_fnqfxkb,1587172397.0,It was a horrible midterm. I’m curious what the average was.
ucr,fnqu8rq,t1_fnqtvq7,1587172348.0,Right! I felt super rushed. It was a horrible experience tbh.
ucr,fnqu61m,t1_fnqtm6l,1587172301.0,Yeah I felt that! I get that he’s doing this to prevent cheating but he shouldn’t be asking questions about things that weren’t on the videos or the notes. It was a horrible exam. I’m sorry but I’ve lost all respect for Prof. Maduro
greysanatomy,fnqeckb,t1_fnqe4td,1587162943.0,Hahn is soooo underrated! I loved her
greysanatomy,fnqe3ln,t1_fnqduej,1587162804.0,"I’ve never hated anyone on the show as much as I hate her lol! If Shonda needs to/wants to kill someone, it should be her"
ucr,fnnzbhk,t3_g2w1bh,1587106537.0,Hello!
greysanatomy,fnnuvck,t3_g2udhr,1587102441.0,It’s so funny how Meredith is the “main” one in the show and is the one with the least votes from this list 😂. #TeamYang
ucr,fnn634c,t1_fnlbht2,1587085211.0,"It’s not, people exaggerate. This last quarter you were able to find parking easily. Trust me, it’s not as bad as everyone says."
ucr,fnk7f7k,t1_fnk5y0j,1587017246.0,I don’t think this is true lol. The website clearly states that with 8 units one is considered a full time student in the summer.
ucr,fn4lvmm,t1_fn4kmiv,1586644070.0,He worked hard to get here though. He has multiple degrees. Plus the manuals aren’t THAT expensive. They don’t cost as much as other textbooks we must buy for certain classes.
ucr,fn4jo81,t1_fn4dkpo,1586642753.0,"A person’s hard work should be rewarded. I would love free manuals lol, but I get why we must buy them."
ucr,fn3u71l,t3_fz648a,1586627989.0,It’s easier lol. You just watch someone else do the lab and jot down the data. The lab manuals were free this quarter.
ucr,fn27ghv,t3_fytdym,1586579978.0,"I think it’s doable! But I wouldn’t do it lol. It’s summer, enjoy it (even if you’re just watching Netflix or playing video games). English will take a bit of your time, specially if you’re not a great fast writer. I’m a horrible writer so I took forever to get my thoughts on paper. Also take into consideration that 1B is the hardest of the series, at least for me it was. Best of luck! 

Btw this is a comment based on taking two classes at the same time. I would only take english and focus solely on that. Maybe take that other class for section B?"

ucr,fmtkiy6,t1_fmrov23,1586374294.0,"I've been having that problem too, but try moving around the house. I take my am lecture in bed lol, next lecture in the living room etc. It seems to work for me. Best of luck"
ucr,fmnwlzv,t1_fmnggmh,1586237447.0,Fokwa is ALL self study LOL. People would only go to class because of the clicker questions
ucr,fmklimg,t3_fvtpgi,1586159161.0,"I took 9A and I watched “The Organic Chemistry Tutor” on YouTube. Highly recommend!!! My professor didn’t teach well. She was really really bad lol. Thanks to countless YouTube videos, I ended the class with an “A+”"
ucr,fmkceau,t3_fvsljp,1586150441.0,"I commute so I can’t answer 1-3 lol. 

4. Bringing a bike/skateboard/scooter is really helpful. It’s a pretty big campus. If you feel comfortable bringing one do it, it’ll be very useful 

5. EVERYONE wants to make friends, just talk to people in your class. That’s what I have been doing and everyone’s been relatively nice. 

Best of luck :)"
