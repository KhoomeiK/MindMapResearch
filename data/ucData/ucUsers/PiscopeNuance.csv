CompetitiveMinecraft,fmks4ye,t1_fmkh0fs,1586166508.0,"While most of your points are valid, Mineplex definitely has a decent anti-cheat. If we're just speaking anecdotally here (as you mentioned some of your younger friends), I'll say that many of my non-Minecraft playing friends have hacked on both Hypixel and Mineplex using the same clients and the same settings, and a lot more got banned on Mineplex than Hypixel. 

However, the whole Mac virus vs Windows virus thing is definitely a good point, and the main reason you see a lot of hackers on Hypixel."
