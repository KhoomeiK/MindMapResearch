Smartphones,fny4fcn,t1_fnxz3cv,1587353153.0,"Yeah don‚Äôt refund unless swappa forces you to. I would ask swappa to step in; in the comments.

If USPS did lose the package they‚Äôll give him or you $50.

Yeah worse case scenario swappa sides with the buyer and forces a refund. Then you‚Äôll have to file a claim and USPS will pay you $50.

But based on what you told me having the receipt, tracking and all that gives you the advantage."
Smartphones,fnxxmgm,t1_fnxw1cr,1587348564.0,"Priority mail comes with $50 unless it‚Äôs priority mail express. So worse case scenario you‚Äôll get $50 from USPS if they lost the package. 

If the buyer is claiming non-receipt tell him to file a claim with USPS. Because it shows delivered per the tracking.  

But honestly as long the tracking shows confirmed delivered to address provided. Swappa will typically side with you and tell the buyer to file a missing package case with USPS. 

So you should be solid based on my previous experiences but some advice.

I would recommend buying insurance up to the value of what you are shipping. Best way to do this pay for shipping online, get your label and just drop it off. High valued items that insured typically require a signature for free."
Smartphones,fnxvgwm,t3_g4hzky,1587347204.0,"Did you get insurance for the shipment?

b. tracking shows delivered."

UCI,fnje15t,t1_fnipgcx,1586997077.0,Well you should ask them not to or get UCSHIP and your own car insurance so there is no excuse. But based on that information if they aren‚Äôt paying more than 50% it‚Äôs tax fraud. So you can throw that at them see if they bite and have a change of heart.

Sounds like a scam but a way to filter them out quickly just send the PayPal.me link and say send me the money."

UCI,fmkndae,t3_fvs0p1,1586161138.0,I would look at assist to figure what classes are required to transfer as electrical engineering. The engineering school is still going to require you to fulfill those requirements. So you‚Äôll need to take more lower divs/gen eds and maintain a 3.2 GPA minimum. I went through almost the exact thought process when I came to uci.
applehelp,fmk8ir4,t1_fmk5vsq,1586147328.0,"I believe it‚Äôs logic board related could be age, liquid, impacts or third party chargers that caused it to fail.

Or could be software related you would need to plug the device into a computer with iTunes and restore the device. 

Adding to my diagnosis if it were the battery it would power on while connected to a power source up to the home screen. 

The device would be usable under direct power conditions but shutoff if dependent on the battery. Judging by the device condition this device has had a good run and been through it. 

Also a battery for the iPhone X & up is $69 plus tax at out of warranty cost."
