Accounting,fpn2yc5,t3_geeiph,1588748569.0,"If you want to be an accountant, being an accounting major is a great place to start. Depending on what school you‚Äôre at, you‚Äôll have different opportunities to recruit for different internships and experiences at different firms. Join your school‚Äôs accounting society/club/association and you‚Äôll learn a lot more."
fatFIRE,fpn2qel,t3_geeeys,1588748399.0,At least 6 figures. 100k probably won‚Äôt cut it. You‚Äôre likely looking at 200k+ annual income. Part of the FATfire lifestyle is not sacrificing so much of your life just to retire meaning that sure if you‚Äôre frugal you can stash away 50% of 100k but most of us rather spend some along the way.

There are some public firms in Sac, mostly local ones, though Moss Adams has 100+ people in the area. The big 4 each have offices in downtown or Roseville, but very small. Not sure about other firms but I know lots of local firms are out there.

For the most part, agriculture and government are their big clients."

Accounting,foqx2h3,t3_g8trq7,1588002339.0,"I go to ucsb. The premajor requirement weeds a lot of people out (you have to get 2.85 in the 5 premajor classes with classes where half the class is curved to a C (3 Econ, 2 accounting). You also should take into consideration that it‚Äôs Econ AND accounting which means you‚Äôre taking more Econ classes than the normal accounting student does at other schools. 

In terms of recruiting, it‚Äôs great. I know people that will intern or start full time or have started full time at all of the big 4 and many more firms in the top 25 in both NorCal and SoCal. If you start networking as a freshman, it‚Äôs basically a cake walk. You just have to network and go to all the events and keep your grades up and then the firms basically come to you.

Edit: saw you‚Äôre a transfer, you need to get a B in Econ10A then, a notoriously difficult class (and may even be more so for transfers)"

‚ÄùDear Students,
 
In the recent weeks, there has been much discussion about pass/no pass options for Spring quarter classes. I have been asked to email the department policy to you. Upper division economics courses and accounting courses MUST be taken for a letter grade (they CANNOT be taken as pass/no pass). This policy is consistent across our pre-major and major classes, as required by the University.

Best,
Lauren Mart (formerly Schroeder)

Also was sent out in an email by Kelly Bedard to faculty who was forwarded to me by multiple professors."

A lot of us don‚Äôt know if we want to do it forever. For some of us, it‚Äôs just where we want to be temporarily. Some may stay in accounting forever, others will go on to business or law school, or into different fields entirely. You only have one life to live, but keep in mind that you have great path ahead of you in this field to start, but you can always change it down the line."
