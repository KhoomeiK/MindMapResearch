UCSC,fnypd5m,t1_fnynogh,1587370680.0,gotcha gotcha. im definitely a bit biased haha ive had 5 classes with him and am tutoring cse13 for him for the second time this quarter
UCSC,fnymntu,t1_fnxjyli,1587367982.0,"My friend group has had several classes with him (cse13, ece121, ece167) and he was always good about emails. Like hes responded within the minute of mine"
UCSC,fnwujxc,t3_g4d25s,1587325728.0,"Idk if you've taken cse13, but some say it's comparable to cse100. The main classes that you want to be careful with are ece121, ece167, and ece118. Ece167 is easier than the other 2 I mentioned, but depending on your skillset going into it, it can be pretty rough.

Once you run out of lower divs, you should shoot for only 2 upper divs a quarter because you want to get the most out of them. Feel it out and ask around tho because there are combinations that aren't too bad. Like I did ece167, ece9, and cse101 last quarter because it's pretty common and that was not too bad."
