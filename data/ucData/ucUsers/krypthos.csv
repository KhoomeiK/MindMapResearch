UCSD,fnnkcbn,t1_fnndms8,1587094403.0,guess how it is for graduating seniors lol
UCSD,fnbu7p1,t3_g0sydj,1586822417.0,"Yeah I noticed that too. Professors are intentionally making the courses more difficult because... They think people will cheat? But don’t people who cheat like always cheat? And I feel like people who don’t would only be more inclined towards cheating given the higher difficulty. Or maybe profs think it is less stressful to do the homework at home? I mean, aren’t we always technically doing our homework at home? For some people it is even harder since their study places are now closed and they are forced to study at home. I was never able to focus on doing anything school related while at home but I guess it’s my problem and no one gives a shit about it. I mean their logic “online courses = harder courses” makes sense up until you start thinking about it. Anyway, profs are supposed to be smarter than us so I guess it’s up to them to decide."
