stepparents,foizy52,t3_g7pka4,1587802968.0,"It’s not good to have your kids sleep in the same bed as you and SO. Why? Think of it this way. If your child got accustomed to sleeping in your bed all the time, where is the time for you and your partner. I personally think it destroys marriages when kids sleep on your bed all the time. Kids should be taught some independence. I never slept in my parents bed and that’s a good thing because when you are raising kids, that’s the only time you have for you and your partner. 
I think kids are important but so is your relationship. You can’t have a stable relationship without boundaries and kids can learn and should learn those boundaries. I think it’s bizarre that parents let their kids sleep with them. Why? Kids should be supported not coddled. They need to know how to be independent but with structure and loving support. I never felt like my parents hated me for not sleeping with them. I especially think it’s weird for dads to sleep next to their daughters at a young age. Please just let your kids learn to be independent but know that you are fully there when you need them. It’s also good for kids to see their parent with their partners have a healthy and good relationship. It doesn’t matter if it’s with their biological parents or step parents. Just keep it loving and healthy."

stepparents,fnxchyc,t3_g4f80t,1587335861.0,I think it’s strange. It makes me I comfortable and I think I’m open minded and accepting of most things. I also see so many people sleep with kids in their beds!!!! Why? I never slept in my parents bed. And I would never allow it. I guess I’m the outsider but a lot of people have their kids sleep in their bed geez!
stepparents,fnvhpmm,t3_g3vtoy,1587293741.0,"Being a SM is hard work!!! You deserve time to do you and have peace of mind or whatever. Parents need a break too but if its a SM or SD doing it, people see it as you being unloving. It is loving. because you should love yourself and that helps with loving the people around you. I struggle with this as a SM. I can't always entertain the kid and I feel like its not my job to when I have work as a full-time student. YOu have to tell your partner you have needs and its not unreasonable. 

best of luck"
stepparents,fnrhun9,t3_g2ue29,1587189416.0,I feel like no one really understands. If I say it to anyone I feel so judged. I have a SS and she’s fine but I feel so anxious all the time when she’s over. I feel like a terrible person. My fiancé wouldn’t understand. I feel you. You are not a monster. You are human.
Stepmom,fnrh52l,t1_fnr55zd,1587188794.0,"I understand how you feel. I feel the same way. As I write this I am sitting alone trying to feel like there is some hope and support out there. I deal with this every weekend. I love my fiancé dearly. He’s amazing. I’d marry him in a heartbeat but I struggle with being a stepmom. I don’t know what to do at times. 
I think for your situation it’s fairly new to you. You don’t know where this is heading. If you feel like there are more bad days than good and you are loosing a huge part of yourself, maybe you should consider being on your own. There is nothing wrong with that. 
I think my fiancé is wonderful. So, I try to cope. I think it isn’t all that bad. It could be worse. But also I recognize it’s not great. I don’t know that a lot of partners understand that it’s hard to love someone else’s child. I don’t love her like he loves her or her mother. And I know there are a lot of step mom who manage and are happy with there blended families and share these happy awesome stories. I feel like telling them that it doesn’t always turn out that way. That’s the truth. I hope you find happiness. If you ever want to chat. I’m here for you."
Stepmom,fnqmwa5,t3_g09fzg,1587167829.0,"It’s totally normal you feel this way. I just want to say you are brave to even express how you feel. I am new to being a SM. For the last 7 months my fiancé and watch his daughter on the weekends. Some days are good and some days are tough. 
I feel guilty sometimes because I don’t even have to deal with an evil BM. Still, it’s hard at times and I don’t know what to do. We’ve had good time but also I feel so out of my element. What keeps me going is that I’m madly in love with my fiancé. He gets upset too sometimes. I wish I could be better. I wish I could just be an adult about it sometimes. I wish I had better control over my emotions. After all I am the adult and not the child. 
I have anxiety every time it’s Friday. 
However, I understand it’s a learning experience for all of us. I hope I can convey that we can learn how to navigate through difficulties. 
First, it might be worth having a conversation with your fiancé. You don’t have to be there all the time. I know right now it’s hard to go out. That’ll change and you can balance time with them in a way that works for you. He is also going to grow up someday. He won’t be a child forever. If you want to do this, you will and it can get better but realize there will always be bumps in the road. And that’s okay. It passes. If you choose to leave and live your life according to you, that’s okay too. We all must do what’s best for us and be happy. I think about my fiancé and how he must feel sometimes. It’s hard for him too. He never wanted kids. It was an accident. He’s living paycheck to paycheck. He really tries his best to be a good dad. But he doesn’t see her a lot and he has a hard time disciplining her and being an authority figure sometimes. I imagine it’s not easy for him too. 
Be kind to yourself because it’s not easy being a SM. I hope your partners puts you and his son as priorities equally. Be honest with him about your needs and I hope he is understanding and loving about the situation."
