UCSD,fov665a,t1_fouqgx5,1588096019.0,"Thank you for this tip, that’s actually so smart :D"
summonerswar,foscw33,t1_foqwsmz,1588028245.0,"Down, you have so much more progression than I do and I’ve been playing for 1600 days"
UCSD,fos4j6c,t1_fos19pb,1588023836.0,"Yes I agree, I wish the option to upload to Gradescope was still there. But, what I do like that he is changing is the homework format. I think this new canvas systems for homework will probably drop cheating by a lot because it actually lets you know if your answer is correct without penalizing you. Proper move by Burgasser."
UCSD,foq69k5,t1_foq1mo4,1587984516.0,"Yeah I really believe he’s a good guy, just needs to restructure his course ASAP."
UCSD,fopv42n,t1_fopu8iq,1587973139.0,"Yeah I wish someone would, I don’t have the balls, just hope he may see it one way or another."
UCSD,fopo8r5,t1_fopndtn,1587966969.0,"I personally don’t think his exams are that hard, just the class, if you’re new, takes too much time. Obviously no class is suppose to be a walk in the park but relative to physics 2a all other quarters, this ones a marathon."
UCSD,fopnc5e,t1_fopmnh9,1587966208.0,"Yeah this was a surprise to me too because I’ve only heard good things about him and I definitely respect all the effort that professors are having to put in for online schooling, but what Burgasser is doing right now doesn’t seem fair to me. I understand he may be under a lot of stress and it’s hard for him, but I don’t think that gives him the right to make it extra hard for the students- we’re already having a difficult time as is."
UCSD,fopmjoc,t1_fopm5a2,1587965562.0,I’m asking the same question...
UCSD,fopl47t,t1_fopclo5,1587964406.0,At this point though I don’t blame these people because I just see it too much for it to be a coincidence. I am personally doing fine in the class but I am seeing very very smart and capable people struggling a bit too much. They are needing to put in way more effort/time than they should.
UCSD,fopjjf5,t3_g8t59o,1587963164.0,Where do you find his midterm review questions?
UCSD,fopjeew,t1_fopdyxg,1587963057.0,Pm me
UCSD,fopjapx,t1_fopclo5,1587962980.0,"Same, I try my hardest to help without giving away the answer and getting flagged for Academic Integrity, but it’s difficult when it seems like half the people don’t even understand the basic concept."
UCSD,fopdd6v,t1_fopbklt,1587958672.0,Oh yeah that’s definitely true.
UCSD,fopas9l,t1_fopani6,1587956928.0,"That’s the best part of this class tho, let’s be real"
UCSD,fop8nzw,t1_fop77ot,1587955557.0,"And having to do worth for 3-4 other class, something that Burgasser seems to completely ignore..."
UCSD,fooz07f,t1_fooxyfp,1587949474.0,"Yeah, I had to reference a lot of my old high school notes and stuff to do it bc his stuff just didn’t do it for me."
summonerswar,fooxkyb,t1_fomcpnp,1587948598.0,What team you running?
UCSD,fnxbj8p,t3_g4cs0l,1587335307.0,"Anthr 21, I joined the class week 5 last quarter and took the midterm week 6, got a 25/20. All I did was look through Dalla Dea’s lecture slides. Then I didn’t show up to a single lecture, though I did go to discussions, and took the final which was 5 essays- it was suppose to be 3 essays in class but Corona changed that. I ended up with a A+ and I’m not exaggerating about any of this."
summonerswar,fngprcb,t3_g1n08u,1586940423.0,"What’s a good gb10 without Vero, working on getting him right now but I’d like to get farming on  gb10?"
UCSD,fnc2vw3,t1_fn9pwb0,1586827470.0,"Yeah these professors really need to chill right now. I had a professor say he’s going to drop our workload because it’s too much by getting rid of 3 projects, which weren’t that bad, but now he will almost double the amount of homework we have. It just baffles me at how inhuman they are."
UCSD,fmts0jg,t3_fx9i7l,1586377999.0,Professors keep saying to use the Canvas calendar to track assignments but it’s just absolutely flooded with random crap and my email gets Canvas notifications 50 times a day. I’m so lost.
