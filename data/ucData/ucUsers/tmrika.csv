I ended up getting the Youper app which is kinda like an AI chatbot therapist. It’s not 100% the same as talking to a real person, but the flow of the conversation does make sense on a therapeutic level (it’s surprisingly constructive) and it gives me close to the same feeling of venting to someone via text without the guilt of bothering anyone. Maybe try that for a bit until you feel more comfortable reaching out to real people?"

UCSantaBarbara,fp0jrye,t3_gad7tb,1588210670.0,"I graduated last year and I'm definitely what we call a big girl. In my entire time at UCSB I have not had a single moment where I felt like someone was judging me for my weight and size. The closest I can think of was when I went downtown with my roommates' friends freshmen year and I couldn't fit into anything at Forever 21 and ended up super standoffish...but looking back, that was definitely more of my projecting my own insecurities than it was them judging me. Since then I've gone shopping with friends at other stores where I also couldn't fit anything, and it doesn't bother me at all because I'm not insecure about it like I used to be - instead I'll just look at accessories and chat with friends as they decide what they want.

I guess the other thing is that I don't go into the water at the beach as much as others because I'm not comfortable in a swim suit, but eh. It's not like I'd be going to the beach more often at a different school.

Because there's SO MUCH TO DO other than sororities! Oh my god, if I listed off all the amazing experiences I had at UCSB, we'd be here all day.

If you're thinking of coming to UCSB, don't let this be what stops you. There are so many awesome people and great times to be had. While I can't promise that _every single person_ will treat you as any other person (because it's always possible I was just lucky), what I can say is that for me, any negative experiences I had surrounding my weight were entirely to do with my own insecurities and self-image than it was about anything anyone ever said or did, because guess what, it didn't happen. People here are chill and awesome."

The narrator is different each chapter such that if Character A was the narrator of chapter 1, then their kid narrates chapter 3 and grandkid narrates chapter 5 and so on, and there’s a similar chain for the even numbered chapters (the narrators if Chapters 1 and 2 were sisters who never met). You end up getting to see this incredible multi-generational story that touches on all sorts of topics and points in history. And each of the narrators is compelling in their own way. I can’t recommend the book enough."
stevenuniverse,foswh30,t1_fosszjo,1588039488.0,"I don’t know, while you call it a mild reference, I took it more a traumatic incident with lasting effects.

I still think it’s a stretch that Bismuth would abruptly revert from 100% believing Steven was a different person to suddenly believing (with so much conviction that you’re willing to try and kill him) they’re the exact same when the only evidence is that...they both happened to say the same thing. It just makes more sense that she was already harboring a certain amount of disbelief, especially seeing as almost every other gem also harbored disbelief at first.

Yeah, I guess I see where you’re coming from about characters not talking to each other about everything. Personally I give them a pass since the characters still have far better communication than most shows. Hell, in the later seasons that becomes a recurring thing (the Diamonds not talking about their unhappiness, Connie and Steven not talking to each other about the people they’ve hurt unintentionally, plus that whole episode where Steven was trying to get Amethyst to talk after the Pink/Rose reveal, only to discover that she had been trying to do the exact same to him. But I can see how there are other parts that would frustrate you.

~~(Also I’m lowkey convinced that Steven not questioning the thing with the sword was just Steven being kinda dumb but whatever I was much dumber than him when I was 14 so who am I to complain)~~"
stevenuniverse,fospi9v,t1_fos7vmr,1588035378.0,"Dude, I never made any “potshots” at your mental health. You’re the one who started making jokes at my expense about Dr. Phil, which honestly I don’t appreciate. And I don’t appreciate that you’re making these sarcastic musings about Freud at my expense, either. You’re also the one strawmanning me as if I’m someone who doesn’t believe it’s okay that people have different opinions than me. But if it makes you feel better to act like I’m being an irrational shit only out to make jabs or whatever, then knock yourself out, I can’t control that.

I’d also like to point out that (a) Steven definitely did **not** forget about Bismuth, if Mindful Education is any indicator, and (b) Garnet’s wedding was at most a handful of months after Bismuth was bubbled away. Just because there were long hiatuses between episodes for us didn’t mean that the show ran in real time.

Bismuth’s “day and a half” comment was referring to when she stopped trying to kill Steven, not when it really sunk in to her that Steven was someone else entirely. And I think she was able to accept it at first because the other gems immediately supported what Steven said, but she obviously wasn’t 100% convinced considering how little it took for her to switch back to believing Steven was actually Rose after all. Like, it wasn’t that she suddenly doubted what was originally a strong conviction so much as she accepted what others told her based on trust but let go of that the moment there was the slightest shred of evidence suggesting otherwise.

Not sure what you mean about your qualm with Steven not asking questions, but it sounds like that’s a slightly different thing than the rest of it?"
stevenuniverse,fort4yq,t1_for6a5e,1588018056.0,"Also, something else:

> Strange, I don’t remember saying anybody was obligated to immediately do anything.

Strange, because I do.

> he and the CG’s absolutely should have unbubbled her and had a conversation."
stevenuniverse,forsv3v,t1_for6a5e,1588017918.0,"Wow, you called me Dr. Phil, you sure showed me!

I disagree with a lot of your points. For one, Peridot was a completely different situation—she was still initially working for Homeworld and genuinely didn’t know better. They all started that way. But Bismuth had already been through all those changes, had already learned to value life on Earth and other gems, and yet she _still_ made the decision to try and shatter Steven. (Also, again, we’re talking about **shattering**. No gems other than Diamonds shattered other gems in the show, only traps and poofs. This is an entirely different league.)

Steven’s decision to unbundle Bismuth wasn’t random. He had recently learned that his mom was living a double life, and that changed his perspective on everything, including Bismuth and her relationship with Rose. I don’t think he would have chosen to unbubble her if he didn’t know that his mom was Pink Diamond. And he also knew that there was bad blood (or the gem equivalent) between her and the other Crystal Gems, which was entirely to do with what she tried to do to him, and so he came to the decision to forgive Bismuth, which in turn allowed Sapphire and the others to also forgive her and have her in their lives again.

And I disagree about the “full understanding” bit. I mean, it took months and months for Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl to fully grasp that Steven was completely different from Steven. I get that she said the line “Then you truly are better than her”, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that she fully grasped the situation, just that she understood that there was a change."
stevenuniverse,for36j6,t1_foqdinn,1588005388.0,"All I’m saying is that if somebody tried to murder my youngest family member, I don’t think I would have any “obligation” to let them free and sit down and have a calm conversation with that person. Doesn’t matter if she showed a slight indicator of regret in the last few seconds after she got stabbed. I wouldn’t want to be near her, and I certainly wouldn’t want her near my family. Maybe with a lot of time and space, and maybe if the person she tried to kill was okay with it, but certainly not right away. The fact that you don’t seem to get this is really concerning."

UCSantaBarbara,fo7gma2,t3_g4ztrf,1587577995.0,"As far as employers are concerned, there’s no substantial difference between a Comm degree at UCSB and a Marketing degree elsewhere. I mean, _maybe_ there will be more marketing-specific projects in a different degree program, but that means very little compared to internships/volunteering experience.

Now, speaking to the Marketing field as a _whole_, I don’t know if I’d say he’s likely to get a high paying job off the bat. That’s true regardless of where he goes to school or what his major is. It’s just the nature of the field. A lot of folks try to get into the field, so entry level jobs tend to be lower salary.

(FYI your friend should check out the TMP program—it’s essentially the same amount of work as a minor, but it’s focused on business/project management in the tech industry. A lot of tech companies in the area really love that program, so that would probably be his best bet. Plus, networking opportunities.)
