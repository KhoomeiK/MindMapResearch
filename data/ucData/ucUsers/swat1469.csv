ucla,fn2krpz,t3_fypxpl,1586592671.0,Ok so like no joke but I fucking transferred from UCLA partly because I hate how students are treated so unfairly. I feel that student athletes and certain student groups are prioritized and the rest of us are left to fend for ourselves. I only bring this up because I believe that USAC has done absolutely nothing in shifting this movement. They constantly take our money and I see no progress from my perspective. Y’all can downvote me for transferring from UCLA but I just wanted to share my frustrations even as a former Bruin.

Accounting,fminplx,t1_fmhpmdq,1586113233.0,I’m in California so I think P/NP grades are accepted. Thank you though!
