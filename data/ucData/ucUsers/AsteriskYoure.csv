UCSD,fn0hy5i,t1_fmze389,1586542269.0,"I disagree — all I see in the article is a newspaper trying to inform students of the doublespeak that goes on at the admin level

Like, literally: HDH's statement was this — COVID-19 students are being moved to an undisclosed isolated residence hall that has been vacated. As it turns out, that was a lie. That's what this story says — nothing about bullshit like the guardian saying they're lepers or w/e

Since when did /r/ucsd start sucking up to the admin?"
