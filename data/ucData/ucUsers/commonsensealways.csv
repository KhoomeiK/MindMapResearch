UCSC,fpdkdxd,t1_fpblabz,1588528714.0,"Oh I see, so you also mourn and shut down the world for the 1million+ influenza deaths?

Let’s just pretend the government didn’t injection Africans Americans with syhpilis and polio without their knowledge. Let’s trust the almighty government."
UCSC,fpasp6n,t1_fpapsoc,1588454907.0,"Good point. My argument is that we are all owners of public property, ex beaches. The government has no authority to close them. Don't fall into the trap by accepting this tyranny. Remember when this all started they kept saying these are just suggestions and recommendations. 

I know it's only in the U.S. but media is not updating their numbers. Where do you draw the line though 35k only though? and you shut down the world? cmon. Liberty taken once is never regained! Freedom and liberty is what makes this country great and is under a threat of never being the same!"
UCSC,fpapih5,t1_fpamvz9,1588453013.0,"No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property aka earning income, running business without due process. The arbitrary order naming some businesses essential does not meet the due process threshold. 

Also, CDC just has a new chart that states only 35k people have died from disease. So that to you justifies this whole thing?"

UCSC,fpaim81,t1_fpagvvc,1588448938.0,EVERYTHING! This is unconstitutional!
UCSC,fpagk53,t1_fp9sevr,1588447720.0,So grocery stores being open is not a risk? Gas station handles etc? What happened to my body my choice?
UCSC,fpag89z,t3_gbpvp9,1588447525.0,"make your argument around not accepting their Terms of Service. school can't force you to accept terms and have to offer accommodation. otherwise, proctorU is a school sponsored monopoly"
UCSC,fp6zemr,t3_gbna8w,1588361278.0,"if you took a picture it should have a date and time stamp so that can be your proof, also the pdf will have a created stamp as well"
UCSC,foxam27,t3_ga13rd,1588138379.0,"So what would happen if you don’t agree to their terms? The school or professor can’t force you to accept those terms, they’d have to accommodate you"
UCSC,fos1rz5,t1_forjdsj,1588022409.0,Yeah it’s tricky. Technically the university would have to apply for the PAycheck protection loans but that’s way beyond my understanding. You should reach out to financial aid and inquire what’s happening. But also try applying for unemployment and be honest with them you might qualify for the PAndemic assistance. Wish you the best
UCSC,forj8hu,t3_g94abu,1588013155.0,"was this work study job? if so, you should be able to get a paycheck for up to a year. but, if not, the pandemic assistance program is supposed to kick in tomorrow so you might qualify for that."
UCSC,fm6u3ql,t1_fm5sbvm,1585803285.0,Why are the hospitals empty? Where is this histeria? Only on tv
