berkeley,fpn388i,t1_fpn1bsn,1588748802.0,tbh I didn't even do the whole design doc. you just have to make sure to test before you move on or else you'll spend hours debugging. plus they give you all the integration tests so you technically don't even have to write any super complicated ones. i just wrote basic-ish integration tests to get the point.

berkeley,fodfadz,t1_fodc84g,1587683961.0,well it's basically confirmed that there will be an online option so it means a majority of things will be online
berkeley,foc8cqj,t3_g6mog0,1587668302.0,"just look up 151 on EECS 101 piazza

&#x200B;

From a quick search:

 151 - Digital integrated circuits + VLSI introduction 2-in-1 combo value deal! Used to be two separate classes, EE 141/241A and CS 150, but each of these courses was only moderately difficult and they covered relatively similar concepts, so the department decided to combine them to make instruction on the part of the professors (and literally nothing else) easier. The conceptual material isn't too taxing, and the only real prerequisite is 61C (although charge sharing from 16A, if that's still covered, and logic networks from 16B show up). You can take the ASIC version of the lab (from 141) or the FPGA version of the lab (from 150), but will need to design a pipelined RISC-V processor as your final project in either case. I will say that it was pretty cool to run C code on our design at the end of the class, but the work is quite tedious (I think my partner and I dedicated around 90 hours of work to the final project but my memory might be failing me). This is a really fantastic class to take if you'd like to get an internship in industry though, and I found that the progression of the course material matched my interviews quite well. The labs are obviously a big part of this class, again."
berkeley,foc7fue,t1_foc22la,1587667987.0,"I doubt it. As they've said with the summer sessions, the reason it's PNP is because of the sudden change. You will know about Fall in advance, so you can decide not to enroll. 

Of course if there is another sudden change, then it might happen."
berkeley,foc761z,t1_foc2t0t,1587667902.0,"IDK it's really hard to plan because of the uncertainty. Personally, I will still enroll if it is hybrid instruction, but if it's fully remote, I'll most likely withdraw. But this really depends on the state of rest of the world. If we're back in ""lockdown mode,"" then I doubt companies will be hiring interns, much less min-wage jobs other than essential workers. In that case, I might just take a couple of classes because I would rather attempt to further my education rather that spend a semester doing a min wage job since my parents will most likely still be employed. 

However, if the rest of the world returns to ""normal"" and the only (main) thing that's online are colleges, then I would likely take the semester off and either find an internship or another job. But idk who will be hiring so it's really hard to decide so early, because if you can't find a job, the semester is completely wasted."

berkeley,fnfxc9s,t3_g1iqiu,1586917479.0,"I don't know about the content itself, but I've heard one of the reasons it's the hardest is that it's a very self-selecting class. Pretty much all of the people in it have done competition math, so if you are not in that category, you'll be competing against them."
canconfirmiamindian,fncw3ni,t1_fncvdzp,1586849217.0,"yeah that's why I put it in quotes. this guy is super cringe... actually after looking deeper at his twitter, I think the reason he is paki-friendly is because he automatically gets free likes/rt/comments from them since they have nothing better to do. If you look at comments on his tweets, they are all from pakistanis or muslims."

He's learning urdu and a bunch of other shit, so all the twitter porkis love him. TBH i don't even get his endgame because he's a hard core catholic. maybe he wants to convert them all??? Just look at his twitter (same handle)"

This better be curved rip. They said they would find a way to make up for the partial credit you can get of free response exams but looks like that didn't happen. Or am I  just stupid and it was actually easy for most people?"
berkeley,fmg5num,t1_fmg1b52,1586041785.0,i think that means that the learning is mostly through programming assignments rather than lectures. I assume they're going to just have online office hours all day on days without lecture so that you can still get help while doing the labs
