UCSC,foohl3r,t3_g8mvds,1587939095.0,"Dorm life is wild and a blessing. Do NOT expect luxury accommodations here. As a transfer you’re most likely going to be in the porter transfer community. You’ll have room options for a single, double, triple, large triple, quad, or quintuple. That means 1-6 people in the same room. The more people in your room the less expensive it gets. Just beds and desk in close proximity. You’ll have communal showers/restrooms, as well as onsite laundry in the building adjacent. Keycard access only for literally everywhere. Each floor is different, but the higher up you go the more wild things get (at least that’s how it was when I was at porter). Since you’ll be on campus you HAVE to get a meal plan. Living on campus is a blessing bc you don’t have to deal with getting off and on campus as much and it’s very convenient. Unless the rules have changed you’re guaranteed a year on campus. Who you room with and what floor you’ll be on is not a guarantee. It’s either a hit or miss. It’s an amazing way to make new friends and find your communities on campus. And honestly it’s a rite of passage for college life. Now it was high key an adjustment for less privacy and small space bc I was in a triple but it was hella fun and I met some amazing people."

UCSC,fm3fne9,t1_fm3ddg4,1585721914.0,"Because money is far more important than our health. I wish it was the other way around. Ambulances cost thousands, student loans cost thousands, rent/utilities cost thousands, food and essentials add up. Can’t survive off multiple minimum wage jobs that don’t care about us."
