Well we kind of do, it's called the Common Core Standards Initiative and 41 of the 50 states have adopted it. However, it is an opt-in system, and the reason for that has to do with the centuries old, states rights vs federal rights argument that is incredibly complex and has far-reaching consequences so I'm not going to get into that.

Also you keep saying the US has ""low standards in education"", but can you provide an example? I'm a high school teacher, and I've actually read the Common Core standards (because it's my job) it's mostly focused on higher-order or critical thinking, and gaining understanding of why things happen instead of just rote memorization, which is how it is in Japanese schools (the only other school system I'm familiar with). Have you actually looked at the standards, and if so, which ones in particular are ""low compared to other countries""?"
