Increasing diversity in the number of materials used to make tools and the difficulty of working with those materials, and increasing diversity in the set of tools used (more specific tool purposes and additional purposes - needles, bows, awls, and countless others), increasingly complex reshaping of the landscape for purposes of settlement and hunting, the development of new construction techniques, etc.  This all between 200k years ago and around 10k years ago.

We weren't technologically stagnant.  We have displayed a roughly exponential growth in material culture complexity for the entirety of that 200k year period.  Compare the technological change of the 4th millenium BC to the last few decades.  The reason for this, in my opinion, is a combination of our exponentially increasing ability to provide for our basic needs with a minimum investment in time, allowing for more time to be invested in innovation, and our increasing ability to pass knowledge on to future generations, allowing our collective knowledge to build on itself.

You're referring to two different types of nonconformity.  These are examples of not conforming to the gender binary.  That is not rooted in gender, not gender expression.  The other type of nonconformity, the one being discussed in the OP, is when your personal behavior and appearance choices don't conform with what is considered normal for your gender.

>From personal experience around many of these people (although I'm sure this doesn't hold true in every case) it is an expression of their personality, interests, etc.

From personal experience with many genderqueer people as well as people who are not genderqueer (in other words, everybody), I've found the inverse to be the case.  Elements of personality are a reflection of how one understands one's own gender identity.  That is informed by culture, both in terms of awareness of gender and what that culture's gender expectations are, but the causality is reversed.  The core of gender identity is rooted far more deeply than any element of culture is (we can see that from the deeply developmental of brain structure differences), and cultural expectations shape how that is reflected in which cultural behaviors we engage in.

>Of course you can knock that up to the wiring of their brains too, but then at what point do you stop?

The structural patterns that I am talking about are clearly visible on zero-magnification brain images.  That is not true for any sort of cultural behavior.  There is no hard line to be drawn, but we can recognize blue from red without having to decide on where either turns to purple.

>From what I understand talking to these individuals is that they simply learned there was a term which described them better. I'm not against that but I also don't think it is entirely necessary in an ideal world.

These terms don't just reflect cultural expectations.  These gender identities are recognized in distinct cultures with fundamentally different expectations for what is typical of any given gender.  When you change up those norms, gender expression changes, including queer identity expression, but the root of that identity is still present.  Doing away with those terms delegitimizes that core identity as cultural expression rather than as something deeply developmental, when all available evidence indicates that something deeply developmental is indeed going on."

As far as I see it, part of the trouble is that this ideological spectrum from ""progressive"" to ""moderate"" is far, far too simplistic to represent actual voters.  For example, one thing that we saw with voters who ranked ""bringing fundamental change to Washington"" high on their list of priorities is that while many of them broke for Sanders and Warren, a substantial portion of them also favored Buttigieg.

Is it?  All that's clear is that the majority of primary voters supported Biden *above* Sanders.  Sanders had the second-highest number of people who supported him *above all others*, but we also saw that supporters of all of the candidates were highly varied in who they had as second choices, including between Sanders and Biden.  The narrative of a ""centrist block"" and a ""progressive block"" that were totally distinct from one another and together comprised the entirety of the Democratic electorate was demonstrably false.  [Buttigieg's supporters at the time of his exit are a good example, but broadly speaking we saw this across the board.](https://morningconsult.com/2020/03/01/pete-buttigieg-second-choice-polling/)  

Another good model to check this would be a ranked-choice vote.  [A SurveyUSA poll at the end of February had Sanders winning such a vote, even with Biden still in the race.](https://www.fairvote.org/democratic_primary_2020_poll_feb_28#second_choice_table_feb28)  SurveyUSA gets [an A rating](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/) from 538.

And that's not even looking at something as simple as a favorability poll among Democratic voters, where Biden and Sanders are roughly neck-and-neck in the mid-to-low-70s.  What all of this clearly means is that not only is Sanders *supported* by a large majority of Democratic voters, but it is entirely possible that without Joe Biden in the race he is the first choice of an outright majority.  What you're proposing is that we ignore all of this and hand the decision over to electors that don't even show up on the primary ballot, even if they are technically elected.

As far as the rules of the party go, yes, that is how it is done, but selecting a candidate that did not get the largest number of votes, let alone one that didn't even *run*, would demolish party unity and result in a total rout in November.

To briefly highlight some points, the root of all of this is our capability for symbolic thinking.  We can understand one thing to mean one or many things beyond its surface meaning.  This has played a huge role in the development of language, as words are sounds representative of concepts, often highly complex concepts.  It has also lead to a pervasive use of symbolism elsewhere in our daily lives, and famously throughout the archeological record.

We also have a highly evolved ability to interpret the significance of what happens around us.  At its most basic, this is a survival instinct.  Recognizing the tracks of predators or prey, predicting weather, etc.  But we have developed this into a massively powerful problem-solving ability that has allowed us to develop complex tools and behavioral patterns that are not instinctive.

Combine the two, and you get a predisposition towards looking for meaning or significance in anything and everything while also applying multiple levels of meaning to it.  The numerous emotions that can come with those different meanings can create quite a lot of emotional complexity, even when those meanings are largely invented.  In that emotional complexity is the root of spirituality.

Moving a bit beyond that, we're also highly social creatures.  We're instinctively tuned to read small social cues, as well as do things like recognize faces (That's actually a big part of why people see faces in mountainsides, stains, and toast).  When something happens in the world, we tend to attribute to it some element of agency or emotion.  Ego, in other words.  And those egos that control the weather, disease, the growth of plants, etc. are what takes the emotional core of spirituality and produces from it distinct gods.

Now, there's still a massive amount of research to be done in this area.  Our understanding will undoubtedly evolve and many parts of this may well be overwritten.  But it does show that there are explanations out there, explanations rooted in our study of how the brain works on a physical level.

The chain of events leading from the Rachni Wars to the Krogan Rebellion to the Genophage is a perfect example of a deep history that informs how different species interact with one another.  In Andromeda, the two new species are a cartoonish bad guy and a downtrodden victim species with one rebel element, and the relationships between the Milky Way species are muted compared to what they used to be.  Even the integration of the angara with the Milky Way species is shockingly seamless, to such an extent that it's already happened on Kadara before you even arrive.

The best science fiction is anthropological, and there was an opportunity to thrust players into a thoroughly alien society in which the Milky Way refugees were substantially outnumbered.  Instead, we got a Krogan settlement not unlike Tuchanka, an Outcast settlement not unlike Omega, an angaran military outpost that was fine in what it was but did not serve as any representation of angaran society, and a tiny angara ""homeworld"" hub location.

The problem is, they blew it.  First contact with the Kett was actually pretty well done as far as first contact with an immediately hostile race could go, but first contact with the Angara *wasn't* first contact.  There's no initial language barrier, no experience of mutually discovering things about the other in an organic way.  You literally just ask a bureaucrat a bunch of questions about the Angara.  Bioware had so many examples of first contact stories from which to draw inspiration, from Stargate to Star Trek, and they completely dropped the ball.  

And now that opportunity is gone.  First contact is pretty inflexible as far as where it appears on the timeline.  And so leaving behind everything that made the Milky Way feel so large was for nothing.

I'd rather they return to the Milky Way.  Pick a canon version of events for the Shepard trilogy and write a new story about how the galaxy stitches itself back together.  This is their opportunity to show the rise of a new world order, based in the patterns of the old world but fundamentally changed by the Reaper War.  The quarians and krogans, no longer constrained by the lack of a homeworld and the Genophage, figuring out what their role in the galaxy will be.  Humans and turians struggling to cope with the massive devastation wrought upon their homeworlds.  New races like the Raloi entering the galactic community on the heels of an enormously traumatic event in which they did not share.

There's so much goddamn world building *potential* there, and it frustrates the hell out of me that what we got in MEA was a cartoon villain who was decidedly similar to Saren, the Collectors, and the Reapers and still managed to be less interesting than any of them, a protagonist whose defining feature was smarm, and only a single new race.  Why is it that in a game about going to a new galaxy, most of the characters that you interact with are from the Milky Way?  How did that not immediately raise red flags?

Take your example of the heart.  There was a point in time where animals didn't have a heart.  We relied on passive transfer of oxygen and nutrients.  But muscles are positioned all over the body, and many of them have a pumping effect on the circulatory system.  This is true in humans today; our leg muscles are very important for pushing blood back up through the veins in our legs.  If an organism with a very basic circulatory system of this type has a mutation that causes one set of muscles to be just a bit better at circulating blood, that benefits the organism.  More circulation means better delivery of oxygen and nutrients.  Then, 100 generations down the line, one of its progeny has another mutation that improves this set of muscles further.  Carry this on for a couple million years and you've got a working heart that pumps blood not because it was designed to do so, but because organisms that had a heart were better able to survive and have children that also had hearts.

We talk about the importance of ""normal"" function of the heart in medicine because that normal function is important to keeping a person alive, and we value keeping a person alive.  Abnormalities that don't affect its function wouldn't be an issue, however.  If a person had a mutation that caused their cardiac muscle tissue to produce a bioluminescent protein, that would be curious and maybe worthy of study but would not warrant medical intervention.

When we extend this line of thought to sex and genitalia, the latter case more often applies.  We value the heart because of what it means to the person rather than how it came about through evolution.  However we arrived at the shape of our genitalia, what we care about is the people that they are attached to.  If that person is a man attracted to men, that's fine.  We already have an overpopulation problem, so it's not as if there is some reason to prioritize reproduction, and same-sex couples can have medically safe sex just as readily as hetero couples can.

Evolution has no mind.  It's a process governed by dice rolls and statistics.  It doesn't care what we use our bodies for, it just continues based on how we use them.

You have not outlined who you mean when you say ""Islamic scholars.""  You could be referring to yourself and two friends for all I know, and that would allow for a majority to refer to.  I trust that you are not, but I'm just trying to illustrate my point.

>No, cultural ideas are to be thrown away when talking about Islamic morality, just like in science where you throw away personal bias and believe in empirical evidence,

And yet we clearly see differences in the moral behavior of Muslims between different cultural areas.  We see almost none of that in science in the modern era."

The Golden Rule is just as valid a basis as are the writings of individuals borne of a specific era and specific location centuries ago.

>We can show those reasons through Quran and Sunnah, how do athiests bring reasons?

Are you not familiar with the Golden Rule?  It's a pretty simple basis from which to lay out moral arguments."
DebateReligion,fnq78dq,t1_fnq62c8,1587159016.0,"> Majority? What on earth are you talking about? 

How does one become a member of the body the majority of which you are referring to?  Do you need a degree?  Do my Muslim friends count as Islamic scholars?  Do Islamic Studies faculty in Western nations count as Islamic scholars?  What if they aren't personally Muslim but have made the study of Islam their field?

>How do you determine human rights if you are an athiest? How do you prove rape evil to another athiest? Please tell!

""Prove.""  That's the key word here.  You can't ""prove"" anything to do with morality better than I can because for both of us, *convincing* someone of what is moral relies on them agreeing with our basic assumptions.  For me, it would be the value of the Golden Rule.  For you, it would be the moral legitimacy of the body of Islamic writing.

What we can both prove is whether an action is moral *within* our system of morality.  But we cannot prove that our system of morality has some inherent correctness outside of itself."
DebateReligion,fnq6lv3,t1_fnq5lc8,1587158667.0,"> Why do people believe in christianity, as well as islam, as well as athiesm, through the use of logic when they are contradictory? Simply because they are misusing logic!

Those are different religions.  You are speaking to The Islamic Moral Code, capitals to indicate official status.  If there are many variants of Islamic morality, why is that?  Could it be that people are articulating scripture with their cultural norms and integrating the two?

>Maybe music was not the best option because the majority belives music is haram (no consensus tho)

Oops!  How do you think this will be resolved?  You can't run experiments.  It doesn't seem fair to wait on divine intervention to tell us what to do.  Could this lack of consensus be due to a cultural divide within Islamic scholarship that cannot be overcome with logic because the arguments are based in interpretation rather than deduction?

>The best is that if major scholars disagreed, then the problem is not a big issue and people can disagree as well , all inside islamic moral boundaries.

You're defining the boundaries on Islamic morality based on what you can get scholars (and you still haven't outlined who this body of scholars that you speak of includes) agree on.  That's laughable in how permissive it is of cultural elements infiltrating this supposedly absolute moral code handed down through the centuries.  If a major group of Islamic scholars wrote an opinion tomorrow reevaluating the prohibition on pork, how would you react?  Would it matter what the fraction was?  A third?  Would that not throw sufficient doubt on the ban to allow those who wish to consume pork to do so?  What about two thirds?  Would you follow the majority consensus even if it overrides centuries of cultural tradition?"
DebateReligion,fnq5j9q,t1_fnq4xy0,1587158080.0,"> Its simple. Do you know We've got hadith sciences? That we classify them into subgroups? Do you know isnad? Bruh theres a whole science behind it. Its not randomly and mindlessly arguing. 

And what data do you gather?  Do you run statistical evaluations?  How does one gather novel evidence?

People argue over Lord of the Rings canon, and it's not random or mindless.  That doesn't make it science.  Scriptural interpretation is more akin to the study of history than science, and without the benefit of archaeological science.

>Scholarly consensus is centred around the majority.

The majority of what?  All Muslim scholars?  Does that majority show great regional disparities that would indicate cultural differences play a role?"

*Please elaborate on the center of this scholarly consensus.*  I want to know who is represented in this body of scholars.

>Im not arguing my morals are valid at all. I am just sayinf athiests cannot justify human rights. Thats it.

And you're wrong.  Relative morality can justify human rights very easily by establishing basic principles, one being the Golden Rule, and extrapolating from them using plain logic.  And the simplicity of those bases relative to such explicit opinions as those found in scripture makes relative moral systems much better at extending human rights to marginalized groups once their status is recognized.  Gay people, oppressed minorities both racial and religious, women, etc."
DebateReligion,fnq4spf,t1_fnq3tuy,1587157683.0,"> Are you saying that moral codes cannot be overriden?

I'm saying that an absolute moral code that so consistently fails to hold absolutely is no more valuable than a relative moral code, and is actually less valuable in its ability to respond to evolving understandings of the world.

>For example Islam says killing jews for no reason is haram. What else did it have to say to stop some arabs from helping nazis kill jews? What woud u suggest?

How about saying that killing anyone without the most pressing of reasons is wrong?  And laying out in detail that those reasons involve the imminent threat of devastating bodily harm."
DebateReligion,fnq4g43,t1_fnq3ix9,1587157491.0,"I can point to instances of flat earthers conducting experiments, getting results that prove that the earth is round, and ignoring them.  Scripture interpretation is not so simple.  Interpretation of anything written in general is not so simple.

DebateReligion,fnq45sg,t1_fnq3d8r,1587157335.0,"> Look bruh, to reach the final decree of Islam, you have to provide rational arguments, you dont say ""ahh i feel like this is evil""

And yet there is widespread disagreement on the simplest matters, like whether apostates should die or women should be obligated to cover their heads (and to what extent, e.g. the face as well).  It seems that those arguments are not so convincing as to easily override cultural norms.

>The differences are a part of islamic morality itself. 

These opinions on music are directly contradictory.  There is no wiggle room between them, unless they are less absolute than you presented them to be.  Can you explain the nuance between them that allows both to be applicable?"
DebateReligion,fnq3l4t,t1_fnq0zhv,1587157024.0,"You're missing the point.  Your ""objective morality"" matters only to you, personally.  It does not matter to anyone else, because even other Muslims have their own flavor of reality.  That provides just as much basis to judge and condemn another person as does a subjective morality that is arrived at through consideration of the concrete effects of actions.  

The difference is that subjective moral systems allow for reevaluation as our understanding changes (like being tolerant of left-handed people, for example) and that those who ascribe to subjective moral systems are *honest* about the fact that their moral system is subjective in origin, as all moral systems are.  Codifying a subjective system does not make it more valid."

That's not remotely like science.  Science works to settle even the smallest of differences when evidence is available.

Because the necessary data is unavailable.  Are you telling me that there is insufficient evidence to decide whether or not music is forbidden?  Why would god do that?"
