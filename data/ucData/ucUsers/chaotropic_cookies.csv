premed,foytixt,t1_foyqhn1,1588178893.0,"Same exact situation. I’m also brown. Go for it cause it’s super cool. Imagine shooting radiation at patients tumors, or digging through a patients brain to get at and clip their aneurysm. Super entertaining and very impactful based on your skill.

Coincidentally all the Indian docs that told me not to go into medicine, were never interested in research or did none. I have some interest in academia and always like to know why something works the way it does. You can find that in medicine, academia in engineering is so blah tbh."

medicalschool,fmvkngi,t3_fxmhji,1586420442.0,Honestly. I’ve never understood why it wasn’t part of the MD program and then considered a specialty within medicine. Is it due to historical reasons or am I being ignorant?
