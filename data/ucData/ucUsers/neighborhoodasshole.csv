I have a professor who prerecords a week in advance and doesnâ€™t use zoom which is totally fine. There really shouldnâ€™t be an excuse for uploading a whole day after the scheduled class. Especially when most of us are taking an extra course this quarter. I understand that it may be difficult, but wouldnâ€™t it be easier to address the problem after week 3?"
