'Cause someday they will stop showing up
A sweet note and a couple of bucks says ""I love you""

And this grave, it means nothing to you
Still something sweet about the flowers and perfume
I assumed you'd live forever but if you are never gone
Then everything you do will never leave a mark*

The difference is if the prof explicitly tells you the information you need to know vs having to discover what they look for in an exam through trial and error/ flipped classroom.

Yeah and? my whole point is evolution and biology shouldn't override your capacity for rational decision making.

Fertility can be mediated through IVF, most people don't want kids, a divorce because your wife can't get pregnant would be cruel, adoption. C-sections?

liking sugary foods, anxiety (used to help you run away from predators now it gets in the way of interviews, social settings, test taking), most phobias, this subreddit has loads of examples of men putting up with terrible people because they're hot and or sex, wisdom teeth, ect.ect.

And poor ugly men are unattractive to women but its only a problem from the other side. We're cruel and exclusionary because of things people can't control, that's the problem. I suppose you have to care about other people in order to view this as a problem and to reiterate, *Fertility can be mediated through IVF, most people don't want kids, a divorce because your wife can't get pregnant would be cruel, adoption. C-sections?*

I could care less about what got us here. I care about now. It's not the same now as it was then. Back then it was life or death now it's clearly not. Thats like saying we shouldn't use calculators because back then they didn't have any. It's called adaptation and progress.

yeah that's what Germany thought in the 40s. I was going to put more effort into these responses and then I realized you just advocated for an ethnostate and all hope is lost. Have fun watching Nicholas J Fuentes I guess.

It's dumb that people refuse to form intimate bonds with other people because of their race. The fact you looked at those results and are complacent to them lead me to believe that you're ok with promoting ethnocentrism.
