But now it's like we went over 3000 different reactions that are all SO similar and I'm like... how do I organize these?? And if the second midterm and final aren't open note I will DIE. I haven't memorized specifics. Literally I barely know what anything does, even stuff from 51B, because everything has meshed together in my head...

UCI,fp6th9o,t3_gbd3sl,1588358312.0,"Wait, what? How can you take both at the same time?

Anyway, here's my two cents (more like 5 with how much I wrote):

If you're bad at algebra, trig, etc, you REALLY need to get better at it for 2A/2B. In fact, if you're bad, it'll just slow you down. They expect you to remember things, so they won't be like ""okay, let's spend a short time on reviewing this from algebra..."" lol no. They'll just be like ""Okay, now complete the square and factor, now do polynomial long division..."" and you'd be like ""uhhh...""

How do I know this? I was one of those students. I got a C- in both Math 2B and 2D because I ignored all the stuff from algebra/trig. Trig identities? Who cares! Well, there you go, now you can't find the integral of cos\^2(x) on your final and you miss 10%.

About 2A... I failed math 2A when I took it during the school year. Took it during the summer with no other classes and got an A, but I took it at CC, so, maybe that can help you? Except I feel like I crammed, considering 2B and 2D, I forgot a lot of what I learned from 2A. But it was also a year apart. Hmm..."
UCI,fp6ogi1,t3_gbao6z,1588355838.0,"I can't stop laughing. This is HILARIOUS.

Also, my ENTIRE test, I was reading aloud the questions to myself and because most of it was typing, I was reading out what I was typing! I'm sure my video will get flagged and now the teacher will have to watch me in my most unflattering attire (because who can be bothered to get dressed up anymore?) reading off test questions. It was nerve wracking tbh... I don't like Respondus. But I can understand why they do it, and I was definitely too afraid to even THINK about cheating."

I would stay up until like 3 and then be so anxious about zoom and the midterms and stuff that I wouldn't study, I missed like 3 assignments, etc.

So then I said, ENOUGH. I'm going to treat this like a full time job.

Every day, I work from 12-6. When I finish at 6, I'm done. I get to relax! I can stay up as long as I want! No commutes, nothing. It's actually SO much better. I'm actually AHEAD of what I need to do!!! It's ridiculous! I actually remember things now! and at first, I thought it wouldn't be enough.. but it turns out that if you actually study instead of half study, 6 hours is enough.

The word ""magnifying"" comes from the verb ""to magnify"", and you don't pronounce it magnifine, when I say it I say the entire -ing part. ""Magnify"" is a verb (which is why I joked that ""magnify glass"" sounds like you're answering the question with ""I would magnify some glass to kill the ants""). 

In the case of ""magnifying glass"", it becomes an adjective to describe what the glass does, just like the words ""chopping block"", ""heating element"", or ""watering can""."

My ex's neighbor's dog's uncle (98M) (I swear this is relevant later) was walking along and was Jewish (I swear this is relevant, it comes into play later) when he found himself in a bakery (also relevant). Well he wasn't supposed to eat sweets because he was diabetic (relevant right now I swear) but he did anyway. My ex's neighbor's dog told me that he felt so bad he nearly considered jumping into the oven (350F) out of guilt for not being able to warn him.

I (25M) couldn't warn him, mostly because I don't have time travel powers, I didn't know him, and he was technically a dog (did you know that dogs can get diabetes? I didn't, before I made up this fake story). Anyway Reddit now his ghost (deceased, 30, M) is chasing me because he ate a single piece of bread or whatever it is diabetics can't eat. Pasta? idk give me validation. AITA?

Edit: Happy Earth day. Unfortunately BECAUSE NOBODY GAVE ME VALIDATION I AM NO LONGER ON EARTH AND AM IN THE DEMON REALM WITH THE GHOST. I would APPRECIATE it if you said NTA under my post. Not a SINGLE person gave me a verdict. YOU ARE ALL TAs"
