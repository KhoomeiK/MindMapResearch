ApartmentDesign,fpmmadm,t3_ge3zfz,1588736238.0,"I'd probably try to find a counter height table that can double as extra counter space when needed. Since you're in a smaller space, having things that can serve two purposes is great.

My parents use the second bedroom in their condo as a tv room. IMO, 9x9 is a bit small for a tv room depending on how large your tv is (not sure if it will be far enough to view the tv) but up to you. You may want to consider using it as a home office, and using the den for extra storage space? Depends on what you own"
Adulting,fpbzyln,t1_fpbzl04,1588483329.0,"I can't give you specific advice because I'm not in canada, but if I were you I would stop listening your mom because she seems to be misleading you or not telling you certain things - and instead next week call a couple of banks in your area and inquire about a high school checking account.

Typically student accounts are based on age, not where you go to school. I got my first checking account when I was 14 and wasn't required to have a parent with me, but again it depends on bank and location."
Adulting,fpbysqr,t1_fpby93q,1588482361.0,"You should start by having a bank account that you can have some control over. I am not familiar with canadian banks, but typically there are smaller, regional banks that may be more friendly towards young people. Go in and say you want to open a checking account. You may want to open a savings account too, so you can start saving early. A lot of places have student accounts or accounts meant for young people that do not have fees, ask about those, or they may bring them up.

Once you have a bank account there, you can try and apply for a credit card since you now have a banking relationship with them, and also you have an account that you can use to pay your credit card with. I would go through this process in person, as it will be helpful for you to have someone walk you through it. 

Two things will happen - either they will give you a credit card with a small limit, something like $100-$300. OR you may have to first get a secured card. This means that you will essentially give the bank a deposit that is equal to your line of credit, which they would use if you ever didn't pay your credit card bill. It is slightly different than a normal credit card, but it is a good first step in building credit."

Adulting,fpbxwgm,t3_gba1y8,1588481643.0,"If the vehicle is real and they are not claiming that they will ship it from out of the country then it's likely not a scam. Best course of action would be for the seller and their friend to coordinate getting the pink slip signed by the owner and airmailed back, and then you can exchange your money for the signed pink slip with the person who is storing the car. 

Then you can take the signed pink slip to the dmv and transfer the title to your name."
Adulting,fpbwrls,t1_fpbrqhq,1588480769.0,"No - credit scores in Canada are still a thing. He meant the USSR probably didn't have much of a credit system.

OP, the best thing that you can do right now is browse the resources that are out there. /r/personalfinance  has a lot of great information. If you can, start building credit now. 

I applied for my first credit card when I was 16, and now I'm in my mid twenties, have a credit score in the high 700s, and have had no problem getting multiple apartments or car loans. 

Many banks offer student credit cards with small limits, like $500. See if your bank has something like that and use it to pay for your normal expenses, but pay the card off every month."

frugalmalefashion,fp8wsb6,t1_fp8sfhh,1588405724.0,"Yeah, 38% is a pretty low margin for clothes. Most retailers get a 50% profit margin on apparel. It's actually one of the most profitable things you can sell"
OCD,fp55hrn,t3_gb9rw0,1588316968.0,"Yeah! Intrusive thoughts are just that - intrusive. They have different themes for different people. Mine also tend to veer towards things happening to me, like going blind or deaf, or going to jail. The other big one for me is former memories that bring a lot of guilt or sadness. They will just plop themselves into my head and replay and replay over and over."
OCD,fp54xbf,t1_fp4fmbv,1588316423.0,"Yeah. In my head I can understand that I know it's a compulsion, I know I feel that I need to do the compulsion because it will make me feel safe, but I somehow can't then bridge that thought to say I will feel safe anyway if I don't give into this because it's not real...

I think it's because there's some thought of ""but what if this time it IS real?"" And makes me cast doubt"
OCD,fp4f5jk,t3_gb59et,1588297721.0,"The feeling of 'I don't have to do this but I do' hits so close to home for me. I feel like elements of my ocd have gotten worse under shelter in place, and I can feel myself giving in to compulsions. When I do them I know they are compulsions and I know that they are not real thoughts - and yet, I end up doing it anyway to satisfy something inside me to make me feel better.."
HealthAnxiety,fowzert,t3_g9z92q,1588130480.0,"Here's the thing - it really doesn't matter. To be honest you probably already had it from your mom. Herpes sheds even when there isn't a visible cold sore, and because it's so easy to spread, 50-70% of people have it and a significant portion of them are asymptomatic.

Doctors don't test for it because it's super common, the tests have a high rate of false negatives, and because it has no impact on most people's lives other than causing a minor skin condition. That's not to say that people who have it should not disclose - they absolutely should. And if you want to get blood tested for it - you can ask for an HSV 1 and HSV 2 test. And if you test positively for it, you'd probably start having to disclose to people that you have it - which may open up a whole new type of anxiety around rejection. 

My advice would be to not worry about it unless you see an active outbreak. If you are concerned about passing it on to partners, or getting it from a partner, make sure you're practicing safer sex by using a condom and dental dams for oral stuff (it's very easy to get an HSV-1 infection from oral to genital transmission)"

TumblrInAction,fopshul,t1_fo2qdi3,1587970685.0,"If you're a virgin but have received oral sex you could possibly have herpes. HSV-1 can be transmitted from oral to genital contact if you do not already carry antibodies. (Typically if you already have HSV-1 orally, aka cold sores, then you would not be able to get it genitally) 

HOWEVER, if you get oral cold sores it may be something you should consider disclosing to your partner, as you could potentially give them genital herpes if they do not have HSV-1 already."
