Unemployment,fpkvzla,t1_fpkvgbc,1588701995.0,"Yes, it came through early Monday morning and it included the extra $600 for weeks starting March 30. I had a card already because I was on unemployment 8 years ago and I requested a new one a few weeks ago. It's easier to get a new card if you've had one already. I'm not sure how long it takes for people who are getting UI for the first time."

LosAngeles,fpfkr3v,t1_fpf56x7,1588574288.0,"Burbank is kinda crazy in regards to how many good donut places there are. Dad‚Äôs, donut hut, and both donut princes are amazing."
LosAngeles,fpfkgy4,t1_fpffboc,1588574033.0,Burbank has 3 legit donut places
Unemployment,fpelf7b,t1_fpel005,1588549815.0,$167 for the weeks March 9 - March 29 then $167+$600 starting March 30
burbank,fpekfgf,t1_fpdq3r2,1588549263.0,When I was in high school they didn‚Äôt have that rule. It looked like we were giving the bowl cpr. Just mashing everything in.
burbank,fpekbdb,t3_gcmpan,1588549198.0,Crazy how long it‚Äôs been in the mall. I started going in 2001-02 I think.
Unemployment,fpek5ud,t1_fpek16d,1588549114.0,"Damn that sucks, hope you can get it sorted out this week. Yeah I haven‚Äôt worked since March 7 and they paid me starting March 9."
Unemployment,fpej6z2,t1_fpej3rj,1588548585.0,Awesome thanks so much
Unemployment,fpeied8,t1_fpei3uu,1588548143.0,"I just tried it again and it worked, there's money in my claim balance. One thing I think I messed up was that I said I worked for an employer. Make sure you put NO on that section. If you put someone else's name/address in your previous claim, you messed up."
Unemployment,fpei7mq,t1_fpegesw,1588548040.0,"Just finished and my claim balance went up. Thanks so much for posting this! Not sure if you will even have an answer for this, but one last question. My weekly award is only $167, is the $600 per week pending, or maybe I didn't qualify for it?"
Unemployment,fpefs3e,t3_gcvy2w,1588546702.0,On the first page it asks if I have already filed a claim (I filed a claim and got $0 award a few weeks ago). Did you say you have already filed in the past 12 months?
Unemployment,fpefd31,t3_gczncp,1588546469.0,You get actual stamps? I thought everyone got an EBT card nowadays.
Unemployment,fpef5y6,t1_fpdsmsc,1588546353.0,I had the same situation and applied again on the 28th but haven't been paid yet :(
ucla,fp2pnpr,t3_gaqom0,1588265790.0,I think you‚Äôre going to just have to psych yourself up a bit. Only 5 weeks left and it‚Äôs all over. Push yourself and you‚Äôll feel good that you did.
nononono,fp2p5xw,t3_gawc9s,1588265556.0,"It‚Äôs weird, you don‚Äôt really see animals making mistakes like that."
Unemployment,fous6wu,t1_foszp3k,1588089518.0,"You could have been paid for weeks you stopped working. For example, if you stopped working March 23, they could have paid you for those weeks so you would have like 5 weeks of payments in your first payment."
gaming,fot5vgo,t3_g9ad1q,1588045339.0,Did you get to play online? I had a neighbor 2 houses away and we would play on 56k dialup. He would call me and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna create the game right after we hang up. Make sure you tell everyone not to use the phone.‚Äù
gaming,fot2tds,t1_foswwsj,1588043386.0,Mine literally saved me from drowning once. I wouldn‚Äôt be here today if it wasn‚Äôt for those speakers.
nfl,fojxu11,t1_foit7n3,1587831571.0,Why? That's something to be celebrated.
nfl,foitwwy,t1_foi2rdu,1587796885.0,"Well Wingo said that the family wanted everyone to know he didn‚Äôt kill himself due to depression - the meds made him crazy. I don‚Äôt know how true that is, anyone know if that‚Äôs possible? It seemed far fetched.

Edit: apparently some blood pressure meds can affect risk of mental illness."

LosAngeles,fn2bt4m,t1_fn1h28z,1586583718.0,I believe if you make 75k or less as a single person you get $1200. If you are a married couple filing jointly 150k or less is $2400. $500 for each child under 18. Then it starts to go down from $1200 if you are single and make more than 75k. If you make 100k or more you get nothing.

Unemployment,fmukrzz,t1_fmukf6i,1586393345.0,Thanks for the info

MLS,fmmt4wv,t1_fmmselu,1586211576.0,Yeah very true. I think people pick a team like Spurs because they have stability and will contend for top 6 every year but don't consider themselves bandwagon because they have only won one trophy in 30 years.
MLS,fmmru1w,t1_fmmrorm,1586210864.0,They only hate themselves a little
MLS,fmmrfmq,t1_fmlqhse,1586210642.0,There are thousands of Spurs fans in America

MLS,fmme5ms,t1_fmlhayd,1586203644.0,"I went to an English pub in Los Angeles to watch Chelsea playing in a champions league game. There were Americans singing their songs in terrible cockney accents. They were not trying to be silly either. There were a couple guys from London leading the way and the Americans were trying to match their accent. Couldn‚Äôt believe it, was cringing hard."
