And I know there’s the narrative of “it doesn’t matter how long you take” or “everyone goes at their own pace, don’t worry” and all but to me I also thought of it as you just lost $70k or more because you didn’t want to take that extra class in the same semester

When I was in physics in college, the biggest physics organization was UWiP. Undergraduate women in physics. Women had a ton of resources and grants specifically for women. Professors consistently favored women

Yes, I am a man, and it’s easy to say i don’t know what it’s like to be a woman in physics and I don’t. But I really was trying to look at it from an unbiased perspective. Anyway, I heard a lot of people talk about how there aren’t enough women in physics and women need resources etc. but they were talking in a tone like there was some patriarchy where men were controlling women and what they do. To be clear, that is not what is going on at all. People are completely free to choose their major and degree. 

I took a few psychology classes for fun, and those classes were dominated by women. 90% women or so. I don’t think men had any resources for being a man in psychology. There aren’t programs incentivizing men to get into those majors. Because people understand that men are completely free to choose any major they want. And so are women. They just aren’t choosing physics. And that’s 100% ok. I don’t see why people see that as a problem"
