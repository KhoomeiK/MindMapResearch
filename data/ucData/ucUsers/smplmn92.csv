UCSD,fpcjkkc,t3_gcm6t5,1588502945.0,"When I‚Äôm in SD, even if I end up sleeping late, I‚Äôm up between 6 and 8, and I as much as I procrastinate, I still get stuff done. When I‚Äôd go home on the weekends, even if I had homework to do or tests to study for, I‚Äôd consistently stay up till the middle of the night and then sleep till noon. This quarter has been one really long weekend for me so far."
personalfinance,fpbvpjj,t1_fpbpzus,1588479963.0,"While I‚Äôm disappointed Toyota hasn‚Äôt updated the tundra yet, I can understand why:
1.	Better to not rush a product. I‚Äôd rather wait an extra year or two (as a consumer) then get a subpar product earlier. That being said Toyota is getting left behind. They need to step it up, and fast. 
2.	Not sure about current numbers but they‚Äôre producing at capacity at their plant. Economically speaking, the lack of a modern comparable truck isn‚Äôt quite hurting them yet."
firstworldanarchists,fpbtrw4,t1_fpb8ynh,1588478517.0,"I guess cuz this sub is about not following the rules, usually blatantly and in front of a sign that says not to do something. So people look at this image and ask themselves, what rule is being broken? Is there a sign or some writing on the box or cans that clarifies it? The answer is no, it‚Äôs simply a packing error."
iphone,fp5rno3,t1_fp3xyv4,1588338305.0,Was hoping to keep my 7+ for another year till the 12 came out. Didn‚Äôt feel anything after the 7 was really worth upgrading for. Unfortunately the 7+ started giving me too many issues and I didn‚Äôt want to wait anymore (especially considering possible delays due to the current situation) and got an 11 Pro last week.

reactiongifs,fp3edm0,t1_fp3bsfc,1588277843.0,"I‚Äôll qualify this by saying I don‚Äôt agree with either party and I think both Hillary and Trump suck. I wish Hillary would stop trying to be politically relevant and just go away and the only clout Trump has is based off the reputation he build of himself, which has been proven false. Plus I‚Äôm not old enough to have been a fan of his because I didn‚Äôt grow up knowing anything about him. 
First, it‚Äôs naive to believe he was joking. His past remarks lay clear precedent that he was serious in what he said at the time. Simply see the other non proven medical recommendations he‚Äôs given. 
Second, jokes are usually pretty obvious that they‚Äôre jokes. I‚Äôd say there are two main factors to a joke: tone and context. His tone was serious and in context of his past remarks, there was no construing he was joking.  
Third, if he was joking, then a wise person understands the time and place. In middle of a pandemic, during a press conference, isn‚Äôt the time to be joking. People look to the presidency for support and leadership, and anything said up there is given a level of authenticity and authority. 
Honestly I‚Äôd love to vote republican, but as my dad says, they haven‚Äôt offered a decent candidate in years. The current Republican Party does not represent the average American. They keep sticking it to us while the rich get even richer. Sure, maybe Keynesian economics doesn‚Äôt work, but their response and solution has been to go to even further opposite extremes and our nation is suffering, politically and economically."

MurderedByWords,fnyhzab,t1_fnygpc2,1587363666.0,"True. It‚Äôs more about the sentiment of it really. Like the memes where the same conservatives say stuff like follow the authorities, etc. and then are protesting against stay at home orders. Or like the one with the woman protesting about wearing masks outside or staying at home with a sign that said ‚Äúmy body my choice trump 2020‚Äù"
MurderedByWords,fny16dy,t3_g4jr5j,1587350933.0,They seem to have so much respect for cops that I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd peacefully put their guns down and let the cops arrest them for violating stay at home orders.
