DeAnza,fmkawcf,t1_fmc75qt,1586149201.0,"I emailed the dean and he told me that campus police is actually patrolling campus till the end of shelter in place and starting next Thursday even faculty won't be allowed on campus! So my stuff is safe till the shelter in place is over. Thank you so much for helping me out, I was so stressed about this before I contacted the dean! :)"
