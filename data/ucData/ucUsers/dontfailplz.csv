Batman is brainwashed and becomes darkseids intel guy with the moebius chair. Superman is poisoned by Kryptonite. Constantine runs away when Zatanna is getting eaten (turns out batman had zatanna put a spell on john to make him run away in case the plan failed). Nightwing is killed but damian throws him in the lazarus pit. However he is traumatized and in a straightjacket. Starfire gets bisected (u can see her guts) but is revived as a cyborg for darkseid. Superboy gets his neck snapped by a Paradoom. Shazam gets his right leg eaten (bogus if you ask me, he should be as invulnerable as supes, even if they are doomsday parademons).

Tons of good Superman fights. The movie really centers around him, Constantine, and Raven"

1. I haven't checked out Ring Fit, but it certainly seems like a good cardio workout to lose fat/get in shape(provided diet is worked with too)
2. You can certainly build some muscle with it, but it lacks progressive overload(progressively increasing weight) and enough weight to maximize hypertrophy with just your body weight. It certainly can do great but if you want to get very big, eventually you will need weights.
3. You shouldn't only try to improve one muscle(or one muscle more than others). Imbalances lead to issues, injury, and you look dumb if you have big arms and tiny chest/back, etc. or vice versa. As with abs, working them out is certainly a must, but they are a muscle that's harder to see with higher fat levels. A big chest can be seen underneath fat, but you may not notice a six pack developing if you have higher fat levels

Honestly, especially with quarantine, you should go with it if your other option is nothing. it will certainly help. Remember, the best workout is the one you stick to"
