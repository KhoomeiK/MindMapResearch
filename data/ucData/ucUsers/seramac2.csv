ApplyingToCollege,fotgisk,t3_g9cqrk,1588053263.0,might be harder to get STEM research if you’re interested in that. and if you’re not taking bio upper divs it might be hard to get a science letter of rec since lower div bio classes are pretty big. but those are the main cons i think
ApplyingToCollege,fot17yo,t1_fot0euj,1588042386.0,"i’ve heard that the opposite is true at berkeley, since there is a large asian population they actually dominate certain things like the business clubs. i’ve heard that it can be difficult to get into a business club as a non asian lol.

does washu feel very premed focused? is there a most common major at washu? one of the reasons why i like berkeley is because i feel like i could pursue a variety of fields there. l am still not entirely decided on a major or career path and i would like the flexibility to explore."
ApplyingToCollege,fosx86q,t1_fosvus8,1588039942.0,"i'm so sorry you had to deal with that. actually i didnt want to mention this but when i say i didn't vibe with it, i actually got some kinda sketchy possibly racist vibes too. when i was visiting stl, one of the restaurants we went to was somewhat hostile to me and my family. i can't put my finger on why but it did feel possibly racially motivated since like you mentioned i didn't see many asians there.

i was kind of writing off my experience and ignoring it, but after what you've said i think i might take it more seriously."
ApplyingToCollege,fosrfyw,t1_fosqv3q,1588036509.0,"yeah honestly i really like the city of berkeley and it seems a lot more lively than stl but it seems like the academic offerings at washu kind of outshine the ones at berkeley. in particular there are a lot of majors/minors, ampersand programs, etc. that berkeley doesn't have. part of why i originally applied to washu is cuz of the PNP major. also, the dorms seem a lot nicer at washu. i'm still not sure whether that's worth the extra $40k/year though. for some reason i just didn't vibe with washu and stl when i visited."
berkeley,fosoaa0,t3_g9avi4,1588034666.0,a post about registering for classes would be super helpful! thanks for putting this together
berkeley,fosgbau,t1_fosfa1h,1588030146.0,Thanks for the info! so do you just sign up for Anthro 2AC like normal and then indicate that you want to do the ES part once the class starts? Or do you have to indicate that you're doing ES while you register?
ApplyingToCollege,fonuj9j,t1_fontofn,1587926732.0,"have you done research at cal? i was thinking about trying to get research through the following ways:

1. urap/surf/etc. - i've heard this is competitive though
2. emailing profs you've already taken classes with abt their research - not sure abt this since lower divs are so big
3. cold-emailing profs at cal or cold-emailing people at UCSF, Stanford, etc.

do you have any ideas as to which of those 3 ways (or a different way, i guess) would be more effective?"

ApplyingToCollege,folrpuz,t3_g824hc,1587868912.0,"i think people overhype the difference in rigor and social scene (although i haven't gone to either of those schools so take that w a grain of salt lol). both are huge schools in great cities, you'll be able to find people with similar social interests. and although there's not much data on this, i think the average GPAs are actually pretty much the same. both schools are going to be very difficult so i would hesitate to make your decision off of which one is ""easier"""

ApplyingToCollege,foljckf,t3_g80slo,1587863479.0,"I know people have said this already but most of those matches are reaches. Once a school's acceptance rate hits 15% or below, you can't go by the 75th percentile stats rule, meaning it is automatically a reach. Also if you're OOS, the acceptance rate goes way down so idk if even Mich could be considered a safety. Actually at this point basically all of those match schools are reaches with the exception of BC and maybe UMich and Wellesley."
ApplyingToCollege,folie1v,t1_foli500,1587862884.0,"so i'm in that weird spot where i don't get financial aid but it would be a stretch for me to pay full tuition. i don't know whether we would go into debt but it would be difficult and we'd have to stop saving as much money and we'd have to cut down on our spending significantly. \[edit: realized i didn't say the price difference. it would be about $40k cheaper to go to Cal\]

i agree that research is probably more accessible at washu although i do already live in the bay area and have some potential research connects just from high school"
ApplyingToCollege,folhxhb,t1_folhokx,1587862603.0,"Berkeley has better research in general than WashU which is why it's ranked higher globally (although WashU beats Berkeley for undergrad). I know Cal has a reputation for being very rigorous but I've also heard WashU is pretty tough for premed as well. Cal and WashU actually have the same grade average for the premed req classes so I don't think there's necessarily more deflation at Cal. I agree that there will be more support in general at WashU though.

idk i'm just thinking out loud especially if I end up applying to med school I feel like I should try to save as much $$ as possible"

college,fnx0lgt,t3_g4adqp,1587329135.0,"You have received $12,087 in aid that you will not have to repay (the pell grant and the state univ grant). You have received $5500 in loans (you will have to repay this). This means you have received $17,587 in financial aid for the 2020-2021 year.

To find out how much you will have to pay for this year, subtract $17,587 (if you accept the loans-- if you don't accept them, just subtract $12,087) from the total costs (tuition, room/board, materials fees, etc) which are probably located on another page."
berkeley,fnpeye0,t1_fnn4ylr,1587144324.0,ucla (along w most schools) also doesnt have a premed major. and ucla premed advising is also extremely sparse from what i've heard. i think all the uc's only have 1-2 premed advisors

Drugs,fnae9pu,t3_g0hl13,1586795977.0,"you should be careful that the drugs don't have bad interactions with anything youre prescribed for the bipolar disorder. also would definitely avoid psychedelics as they can trigger psychosis, especially in those w mental illness. and if youre on lithium, psychedelics will cause seizures (see point 1). in general, best practice is to not use any drugs with this disorder as you probably know

any drug can trigger depression or mania but seeing as how youve been smoking weed for a while without any major consequences, it would probably be the safest drug to continue using if you were really dead set on it"
ApplyingToCollege,fn93h4e,t1_fmywl67,1586758151.0,"funny, i am also a prospective neuro major. are you considering premed? if so, i would seriously consider LACs. i regret not applying to LACs, and now i'm probably going to Berkeley which has like 30k+ undergrads lmao.

but anyway: yes, in retrospect i would definitely have applied to pomona as a reach. beautiful school, great resources, small class sizes. the other claremont colleges range from target-ish to reach in their selectiveness, and since they're all basically connected i would also have applied to them as well.

the schools that i applied to and don't regret applying to: WashU, URochester, Emory, Tufts, Rice, USC, Columbia, Brown, and Yale. I did not get into most of these schools but I think they would have fit my criteria very well. Would also have applied to Duke in retrospect. The reason why I'm excluding UCLA, UChicago, and Northwestern is the quarter system lol.

One school I would highlight in particular is URochester. I would be going if not for the $$ situation. (Would have to pay sticker price). If you manage to get a scholarship there, I would highly recommend it.

Sorry for the wall of text! I know this doesn't directly address your criteria, but these are most of the schools that I ended up applying to and I think we have similar interests."
