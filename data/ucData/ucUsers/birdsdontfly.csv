berkeley,fov5u4b,t1_fov1f8r,1588095865.0,damn. telling it straight
berkeley,fohg6fx,t3_g7420b,1587765421.0,im just gonna take classes online
berkeley,fohfqhw,t1_fohcyzr,1587765187.0,aww pm me her number imma take her out

berkeley,foevp5r,t1_fodb7so,1587716405.0,I'm not sure how late you are but the first step is to make an account on bsc.coop and then apply for the fall waitlist. if you are EOP or DSP you might have priority
berkeley,foa5nl3,t1_foa3m0k,1587640194.0,"Hey I don't think he is calling India the Middle East. From reading his post he is referring to the hypocrisy of students protesting about issues in areas largely irrelevant to the Berkeley community as a whole, such as but not limited to the Middle East. He is using that as an example. I am not saying whether these issues are more or less important but I wanted to make sure the intentions were not being misinterpreted.

On a separate note, if you wanted to avoid renting from unethical businesses, consider living in the Berkeley Student Cooperative community, which has a good track record of ethical practices and providing affordable student housing."

berkeley,fnrikj9,t1_fnrdsi5,1587190059.0,"a lot of the ME courses are basically glorified physics, and you do have the option of taking extra classes in math if going up to differential eq and multivariable calculus is not enough. And of course, you will still have the option of taking some more in depth classes just for fun if you really want, without worrying about making it count for your degree! It honestly sounds like Mech E would be a good fit, you will learn lots of physics including thermo, EnM, heat transfer, fluids, dynamics, and a lot more."
berkeley,fnrdb3q,t3_g3fy2b,1587185589.0,"is there a particular strong reason you want to switch? You would have to get probably at minimum a 3.0 average in technical courses. Seeing as you applied into Mech E, I am wondering what makes you think about switching. You could always take extra math or physics courses if it really interests you, and there is a lot of math and physics in mech E in general, so I'd say talk to your advisor but also realise you will learn alot from Mech E too, and it is a major where you could go to graduate school, and pursue many of the same things that those other majors could provide. IMO those majors lean heavily towards research and Grad School, and you will not meet as many people pursuing that major so it may be harder to find a group so to speak. If I were you I would still pursue mech E but maybe do research or take extra classes on the side if you really need to satiate your knowledge for those classes."

berkeley,fn80d3w,t1_fn59oge,1586731277.0,is that engineering economics? I didn't know it was useful for the FE
FreeCompliments,fmw321b,t1_fmv3iz4,1586438381.0,love the username and the comment. Second law of thermodynamics is a bitch eh
