UCSD,fpjmla0,t3_gdtzm0,1588674127.0,MCWP 40 was interesting enough with the topic of data privacy but the harsh grading killed it for me
UCSD,fpi61ei,t3_gdkmcy,1588634371.0,I’ve given up on Roberts’ lectures and just learn from the textbook. His lectures always go over the 50 minutes allotted time and he spends way too much time answering dumb conceptual questions instead of actually teaching the material.

UCSD,fo2avbs,t1_fo2aig6,1587455497.0,"There’s a separate organization called UCSD Esports that does that kinda stuff. Triton Gaming is more about putting on physical events and managing the venue. A couple members of TG are involved in UCSD Esports but they’re not the same student org.

Even then, I don’t know if this is UCSD Esports or not. Since I don’t see a logo I’m assuming it’s some part of UCSD Rec itself? No idea."
UCSD,fo27mnr,t1_fo172pd,1587452332.0,"These leagues aren't TG-related. We're in no way accountable for them.

We had plans to reach out to CS:GO for TGEX, but... Kinda not happening this year. Either way, we're gonna change how we approach divisions this year, so expect us to contact you in a couple weeks about that. It's definitely not our intention to have any games feeling left out."
smashbros,fo1pmfr,t1_fo1ehiz,1587438553.0,"It’s important to remember the game is made for casuals. If you pick up the game for the first time and your recovery isn’t good enough to get back to ledge then it’d be super frustrating. Same thing goes with snapping to ledge, arguably competitive would be more interesting if it was harder to do, but the game would be more difficult to pick up."

UCSD,fnyncp6,t3_g4nyjw,1587368662.0,"Coming in as a first-year, it was awesome to finally get a group of friends that went deeper than just playing Smash with people in high school. I felt so motivated and college felt like a great step in the right direction. Then this hits and I’m stuck back where I started. Sucks but what can you do except wait it out? :/"

I got a B- in MCWP 40. I went to office hours and put a ton of effort into revising my papers. No matter how much effort you put in, it ends up the same."
