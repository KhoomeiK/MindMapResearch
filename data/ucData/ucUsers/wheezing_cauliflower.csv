Like I distinctly remember kids teasing me for having ""poo in my lunch"" when I brought in daal to elementary school and even seeing other Indian kids join in for some clout. Now that everyone is all about that identity politics and diversity stuff, I see people posting about how ""culturural and indian"" they are and it stings cuz they did not take my side when Danny was making fun of me in fifth grade lmao"
AmItheAsshole,fpbs5ct,t3_gcizmp,1588477361.0,"Going against the grain to say ESH

T10 colleges are really hard to get into and extremely difficult to get into. Congrats to your son. However they are a lot of money and I get that investing in an English degree from a T10 can feel risky especially if you are an immigrant who has fought tooth and nail to give your child opportunities.

Here is a compromise. Encourage your kid to double major in English Lit and something pragmatic for financial security. This is what I am doing at UC Berkeley and honestly it's the best choice appeasing both my parents and my worry as well as allowing me to explore my passions. 

Also English Lit can be a very useful skill especially in the corporate world. Basically all of Dale Carnegie's advice is ""pick your words wisely"" and his book is THE playbook for finance/business/corporate bros."

It's one thing to go to MOP and another to go to any one of the summer programs that colleges offer that scam you out of money

If you are doing it out of interest, its basically like taking a crash course in a few science classes. 

If you wanna a resume booster, think of something truly innovative or creative. Anyone can apply to a summer program, very few people can think of and see through a massive interest based project."

ABCDesis,for7zjh,t3_g92m6c,1588007725.0,"The reason a lot of Desi guys like Kumail in the Big Sick is that he is relatable and accurate representation. For one he's a comedian and because a lot of American-Indian guys are never traditionally attractive/popular they become the class clown in efforts to get respect. 

Additionally in the Big Sick Kumail is wrestling between his families traditionalistic desires and his more modern desires to find love through dating. The parents in Never Have I Ever are oddly supportive of the main characters' desires and for a good chunk of people that isn't the case. 

Like sure there are some classic Indian-American experiences in the show but they just ignore a lot of experiences to make the narrative easier"

berkeley,fo5oyaj,t3_g5und9,1587531314.0,"If you are diligently studying and still not seeing results, it means that your study techniques are self affirming and not helping you understand the topics. Your understanding is covering the breadth of topics you need to know, but it isn't deep enough. Here is a quick checklist that you should go through so that you can re-evaluate your study methods.

1. **When you say you are ""studying"" can you objectively measure it?** Does studying mean ""going over"" your notes and maybe reading through a few theorems or does it mean taking old exams or doing problems out of a textbook or from online. If your professor wanted evidence that you are trying your hardest, could you provide a notebook full of practice problems?
2. **Are you rigorously analyzing your mistakes?** Learning anything is like building a ""thinking machine"" in your brain. When you make an error you have to dissect the machine, find the faulty component, fix it, and put the machine back together. When you get a C on a test, are you going back and understanding each and every mistake you made?
3. **When you learn something can you abstract it?** In the example of Linear Algebra, do you understand span and linear independence well enough to apply it to weird spaces? Can you explain to a 10 year old what exactly diagonalizing a matrix does? You might be surprised as to how shallow your understanding is. I know I was when I got clapped in 54

I hope this helped, feel free to pm me if you have any other questions."

the words you listed are not useful in most everyday speech because they are philosophy-specific terms. It's like saying you want to take math classes to use the words ""covariance"" and ""analytic"" in everyday life despite them being domain specific.
