HotPeppers,fpiy63p,t3_gdn81s,1588651546.0,Big expectations for the one in the massive pot!
beholdthemasterrace,fphky0p,t1_fph1snk,1588623101.0,that would be such a waste of disinfectant.
UCSD,fp3hg16,t1_fp3gup5,1588279366.0,Which is why I picked a small angle and converted it to radians lol
UCSD,fp3h3lt,t1_fp3frt9,1588279193.0,"That's only good up to R3, I need to be ready to go in it all spaces and time ;)"
UCSD,fp3gldw,t1_fp3ejg1,1588278941.0,"at small angles, sinθ can be approximated as θ. ie sin(1deg) = 0.0174524046 and 1 deg in rad = 0.0174532925. It's super useful"
UCSD,fp3f7cm,t1_fp3etd9,1588278254.0,you think you're better than us?
ECE,fozczg5,t3_gabs2w,1588188589.0,"I get where you're coming from, it's hard to stay motivated taking classes online now and it doesn't help that you have professors that aren't technologically astute teaching difficult classes. 

Online tutoring isn't so bad, I've been tutoring people with my ipad online the past few months and it's been working a lot better than i thought it would. If you have questions about either of those classes you can message me and I'll try to help you. I've been tutoring for a while, mostly for those two classes"
HotPeppers,fosh5bv,t3_g9b3fg,1588030613.0,I need to get my hands on some of these seeds. This plant has become so iconic in the pepper community I love it
PepperLovers,fos8mw7,t1_fos1zzx,1588025970.0,"In my experience doing the water blast is not too efficient. Plants end up overwatered, aphids don't die, and they find their way back. I like to take a wet paper towel and brush them off/squish them, leave their juices and remains on the leaves so their mangled surviving friends can feel the terror, spread the word throughout the aphid community, and never return."
UCSD,fopmnh9,t3_g8q16g,1587965650.0,"Dang, I had him for 110 and I really liked him. He always seemed to be very interested in helping students and generally seemed to care. I guess it's harder to teach and manage a large class online, especially since he probably hasn't done it before. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt but it sounds like he needs to chill :/"
HotPeppers,focaudb,t3_g6otec,1587669140.0,"Definitely going to try this too now, thank you for sharing <3"
HotPeppers,fnzne9g,t3_g4urec,1587397348.0,"People do that to get a head start. Your plants will be fine and you'll just have a yield a little later than people who start earlier. I start seeds in January and continue to start them through May, long hot season here."
PublicFreakout,fnyi19u,t3_g4fgfq,1587363713.0,Chelsea!!!!
scifi,fnv1vyx,t3_g414az,1587277551.0,"I think it is the best star trek. Very dark themes, tons of ups and downs throughout the series. Think Sisko had to deal with a lot more than other captains. The characters and their relationships are developed pretty well. A ton of lore!"
ECE,fmcht9o,t1_fmcbwfw,1585945936.0,"Sorry I wasn't trying to be a dick, but those are all great schools (and all heavily recruited from into industry) so you should be stoked! LA/Cal are very overrated imo...

It really depends on what you're into, ECE encapsulates a lot of different fields and while the EE/ECE/EECS departments at all of those schools probably cover most of them, some are surely at least marginally better than the others in one field. They are all very reputable schools with solid engineering departments. I personally would base that decision on where I would want to live the most between all of them."
