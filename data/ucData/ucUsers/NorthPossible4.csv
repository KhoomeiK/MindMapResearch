We are not bagging on the developers. It is an issue with the industry as a whole. We deserve games that are ready to be played when we buy them. 
But I guess some of us have higher standards than you"
playstation,fpmgkzb,t1_fpm8kjw,1588732617.0,"I don’t care. The previous gens were capable of doing it, and they for the most part released games that weren’t filled with bugs that needed constant updates and bug fixes. maKe SeNsE nOw pendejo."
playstation,fpm5pqf,t1_fplyqss,1588726104.0,Nobody has a problem with updates. Literally nobody. But having to download a game that you already have a physical copy of makes no damn sense. And updates that come out the day the game is released is bs. They need to start prioritizing making good games before they sell them to us
playstation,fply863,t1_fpllvll,1588721783.0,No I just want to be able to pop in the disc and play what’s so hard about that. What’s even the point of the disc if buying online is the same thing

Liberalist,fowye6v,t3_g9q1xa,1588129844.0,"I’m a free speech extremist in every sense of the word. But I’m that essence you should understand that all your peers have free speech as well and so the social consequences go right along with your free speech. However what free speech implies is no governmental consequences. The govt I beleive should  never make laws that urge speech, limit it, persuade you not to speak or just any type of person that has to do with your speech as an individual"
HistoryMemes,fooppy5,t3_g8n3qp,1587943858.0,Japan would have attacked the US regardless of events in Europe. The Japanese began their war with China way before Hitler invaded Poland.
RocketLeague,foeq0c0,t3_g5sij6,1587710904.0,Your pseudo I’m better than you attitude is laughable. “Mr. I spent thousands on a game and that means I’m successful bc I’m irresponsible with money” LOL. Bro spend your spare money on something real

RocketLeague,fo86h7v,t1_fo831n3,1587590761.0,If your pocket change is thousands of dollars certainly you can find something better to do with your life than spending it on videogame cosmetics lmao. No matter what your argument is you’ll always be a fool that spent thousands on a game LOL
RocketLeague,fo5vdm0,t1_fo5ttct,1587536923.0,Oh you’re mistaken bud. I wasn’t implying your mistake caused a server issue. Just a life mistake

RocketLeague,fo5fa3u,t3_g5rc2b,1587524242.0,Practice practice practice then don’t play ranked until you’re sick and tired of free play
RocketLeague,fo5f3w1,t3_g5sij6,1587524123.0,Your first mistake was spending thousands on a game that costs $20 lmaoo
berkeley,fo27mva,t1_fo1qooj,1587452337.0,Honestly thanks a lot mate. I’ll be starting in spring so don’t get the advantage of taking any transfer edge classes but I’m sure I’ll most likely be g. Really appreciate it
berkeley,fo1pnyu,t1_fo199pd,1587438581.0,"Have you taken any of the 103 proseminar classes, what’re they like? How difficult are standard lecture classes and also how many units do you take? Is it a difficult transition from cc?"
berkeley,fnx5fvb,t1_fnvofle,1587331838.0,How was it being a spring admit. When we’re you able to finish? Did you have any difficulties mainly because you started a semester later ?
berkeley,fnwl9jn,t3_g4458g,1587320544.0,How long did it take you to graduate? How did it affect you starting a semester later? I’m pretty concerned about this but considering it is corona time I’m figuring it might actually work out in my favor
berkeley,fnv9bf9,t1_fntdunh,1587284777.0,"While I’d say extra curriculars are forsure good, I personally only worked a few part time jobs. 
I just got accepted with a 3.89 and I think what really had an effect was a good personal essay. I put all my life traumas and issues into those things. Fasholy helped me out"
