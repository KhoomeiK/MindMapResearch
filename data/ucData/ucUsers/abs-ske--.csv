GRE,forkytn,t1_fork54h,1588013985.0,Maybe. But let’s never forget how much it costs to take these tests in the first place.
GRE,fooci1x,t1_fonq23m,1587936549.0,"Sure. It’s a difficult situation for all. But if they can’t make a change then what are we able to do from our end besides pointing out the problem? It’s not useful to sit around and hope for the best,  or better yet lose sleep while wondering if one will ever be able to get this task done. It’s unhealthy, especially for test takers under financial stress. It’s unhealthy for everyone. There are other options already on the market. Even if there weren’t — institutions have a responsibility to their constituents and must work day and night if necessary to figure this out rather than hiring technicians who claim they know what they’re doing but can never seem to fix problems."
GRE,foobyb0,t1_foobi9e,1587936280.0,"I completely agree. There are other alternatives. Even if there weren’t, it’s their responsibility to ensure that test takers don’t feel overwhelmed and helpless under extreme and stressful circumstances. If we don’t speak out, they will continue to abuse us while taking our money and replying our inquiries with generic responses that never seem to help. ETS and all institutions have the responsibility to their constituents. I had a mental breakdown when trying to figure this out — I can only imagine those who are already in difficult financial positions having to relive this process spend time on trying to figure this out when they could be working or doing something else. It’s unbelievable and absolutely unacceptable."
GRE,fonz9wu,t3_g89901,1587929411.0,It will not work if you don’t have decent connection. They’re the worst.
GRE,fonn2zw,t1_fonkznh,1587922644.0,Some people can’t even take it. So honestly we have a bigger problem than ensuring the validity of the scores. There will be no scores for some people at all. They need to do something so that people can use it on computer programs compatible with Mac. Or at least provide people with better alternatives than wait on the line for a technician for an eternity just to be connected with a proctor and then get disconnected again. Their system is an absolute failure — no matter how good this idea sounds in theory. If they’re suggesting us to use something like this then at least ensure a better team or better support. Instead of putting people in difficult circumstances and then telling them to reschedule only for the students to find that their next test date is way too late. That’s all.

analog,fj7dbkm,t3_f8j7ji,1583089995.0,How do people find subjects for portrait photography? Someone once said to make a mood board and send to agencies but that sounds costly. Any tips greatly appreciated!
