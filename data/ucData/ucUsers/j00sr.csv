dataanalysis,fpm48do,t3_ge9aey,1588725234.0,"There are a lot of good resources for Python or R online, when I was a student DataCamp was really good for that because it had a student fee,  but not anymore... although a lot of  doing the work is very much trial and error  + looking up what other people do + reading the documentation. You can find datasets on  the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.com and enact your own little project, even if it's something simple like basic visualization. Your program can and should get you started on these kinds of things, depending on how applied the curriculum is. 

A lot of data analyst jobs look for proficiency in a business intelligence (BI) tool like Power BI, Tableau etc. I basically consider it to be Excel on steroids, if you can learn Excel (which anyone should be able to) then those kinds of things  should be easy too.  You can try free versions of these, but honestly you can also just learn it on the job."

It's just weird to see Jackie being thrown under the bus as some mediocre girl when she was serving front runner material for weeks on end while Heidi was clawing her way out of the bottom time after time.

Also this is the 12th season of drag race, I don't think they would pick now of all times to be like ""the makeover guests would feel bad if their girl lost so lets save them all""... I think Ru just still sees something in Jackie"

That said it was a great lip sync and I'm glad they served different energy. I actually think Jaida gave Heidi the only black superfan as a kind of favor to her since it would be easier to paint her from her own experience.

Honestly thought for a second that Sherry might have won the challenge based off of family resemblance, Janet the Planet was pretty iconic, the sibling resemblance was on point and the number they did was the kind of thing the judges really live for. The main problem was her outfit looked a shit ton like her entrance outfit if it wasn't exactly the same. That said, Jaida and her partner looked friggin amazing and I'm not gonna complain that Sherry didn't win. 

Rooting for Crystal and Jackie, must be hard to get this far and not have won a challenge... we don't even know what Crystal's lip sync game is like.

The discourse on Christianity's stance is literally so done to death that it's a punchline (see season 9 skit with Trinity as a nun).

Jackie brought up that being gay is still punishable by death in Iran in an earlier episode, a fact that at least some of the other queens did not know.

Sherry would have been in the bottom for me."

AskLGBT,fnkgg4y,t1_fnjzf95,1587026110.0,"I think it's that getting married is like settling into a monosexual identity in some sense. Gay people look at heterosexual relationships between one or two bi people and get mad that they've effectively ""opted out"" of the discriminatory problems they face normally. It's like ""if I can't be happy then why should you be"" kind of thing. 

And then there's "" I'm worried they'll leave me for the other sex"" ""I think s/he's really gay/straight but won't admit it"""
