UCSC,fnn3vxx,t1_fnn121t,1587083850.0,i dont think anyone at this school cares enough to look down upon anyone. it's all in your head.
UCSC,fnmkq98,t3_g2n2wb,1587073189.0,"shit caught up to me when i transferred fall 2018 and was taking 3 major-related courses. you get used to it, just try to stay on top of the lectures and don't let yourself fall behind. start the assignments (or at least look at them) and start studying for tests at least 1 week before the test date and you should be coolin. reach out for help whenever needed too. 

take at most 2 upper div courses per quarter; only add in a third upper div if it's really easy, with a good professor, or both."
