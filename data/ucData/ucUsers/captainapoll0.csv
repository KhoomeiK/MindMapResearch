ucr,fpfkgeh,t1_fpf94te,1588574020.0,"Yeah that makes sense, it’s really hard to concentrate for 50 mins, let alone 70. There shouldn’t be anything wrong with splitting the lecture into two bite sized pieces though! I end up rewatching most of them at least once anyways lol"
ucr,fpepy0f,t1_fpeejgf,1588552449.0,"This. I understand you’d be angry if they go past class time during a *live* zoom lecture, but in a video lecture where you can go back at any time to watch again, you’re literally getting more than you paid for. 

Idk what classes you’re taking but some of the material takes damn well more than three hours a week (lecture time) to understand. You can complain all you want about your professor pouring in *more* time/effort than he is required to explain an understandably complex/difficult concept, or you can sit down, think on it, and then *commend* your professor for going the extra mile.

Now on the test bit of the rant, I 100% agree. That shit is annoying lol"

buildapcsales,fp84zgk,t1_fp7hcvx,1588383650.0,Same exact problem one year after use. Trying to contact logi support to get it replaced atm so we’ll see how it goes.

ucr,fni45rv,t3_g1oy3y,1586973666.0,"Set aside a portion of the day to yourself (6-8 hrs) where you will work uninterrupted. Do what you have to. Set airplane mode and stop checking your  phone. Treat it like a full workday, pretend you can't go laze on the couch or your bed for those 6-8 hours."

ucr,fmtvq33,t3_fxaynd,1586379844.0,"Imo take it. Getting through 9 weeks to save 30 is a pretty sweet deal. Do ask yourself if you have the time/sanity available to sit down and actually learn the material though. Workload wise it’s a lot of work, however it is 100% doable."
unpopularopinion,fmtuu1h,t3_fw44r0,1586379396.0,"Fellow UCR student. Although I may not be able to speak for the rest of the country, HARD agree. Not with the opinion but with the sentiment. So many entitled students spending government money just to party and fail, then blame how hard being a student is and the workload when it’s just your work habits. 

For public schools in California at least, making under a certain threshold of income guarantees a full ride. Commendable idea, horrible side effect of students that completely take for granted a tremendous opportunity.

Again I agree with the sentiment that too many take financial aid for granted, disagree that they have to work to receive aid. Maybe a higher GPA requirement instead and less tolerance for bullshit. For the Record, full time engineering major, working part time"
ucr,fmq9gp0,t1_fmq5fm3,1586295386.0,"Do you think Skype has a perfect security track record? And for the record Discord not only collects you data like zoom does, they also give themselves permission in their TOS to share at their discretion to third parties.

Surprise surprise, when the focus of an entire country of 300 million people is shifted to an app within the span of less than a month, it gets a bit popular in the news, who would have thought?

This is not to excuse Zoom at all, nor is it to trash talk other services, but to think that all our problems would be solved be switching to a less “shadier” solution is naive at best."
ucr,fmq4r50,t3_fwkynv,1586292848.0,Zoom is pretty standard in industry for remote meetings and conferences. It may have problems but it has def never been shady.
