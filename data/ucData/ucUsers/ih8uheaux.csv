I‚Äôve spoken to a handful of my classmates & we collectively don‚Äôt really know wtf goin on. We‚Äôve talked to the professor about working with us but the dude just won‚Äôt budge.

He‚Äôs just doing the most rn. Trying to force participation in his dry ass lectures and mass emailing us to scold us after every other lecture bc no one really wants to. But I‚Äôve got a feeling it‚Äôs also bc ppl don‚Äôt really know the material.

 His tests cover things that we don‚Äôt really cover in class or in his slides & he won‚Äôt write new tests or give us better slides at least. All my other professors aren‚Äôt doing me like this lol"
college,fov3ggp,t3_g9hwuh,1588094759.0,"I‚Äôm a rising senior in a Finance program rn. It‚Äôs honestly not that hard, but it can be tedious at times. When you‚Äôre doing things like project valuations, there‚Äôs multiple steps to get the answer. So while the arithmetic is rather easy to understand, you just have to put in the time. 

I considered an Econ degree too at one point but I‚Äôve taken 3 econ courses & wanted to rip my hair out bc I personally found it so boring I  Couldn‚Äôt see myself majoring in it. 

Take a look at the degree worksheets at whatever school your looking at, it‚Äôll give you a better idea of what to expect"

But keep in mind that you‚Äôre both very young and you‚Äôll be growing and learning a lot while you‚Äôre away at college. You might find that you want something different in life and that‚Äôs okay.

college,fo7yq3p,t3_g671bw,1587586842.0,I looked through the class catalog and took intro classes in fields I was interested in. After finishing Intro to business and Intro to Accounting I knew I wanted a Finance degree.
college,fo7ydss,t1_fo7syhg,1587586672.0,"I did Algebra 1, Geometry, then one semester of business math in high school. Tbh I took the remedial math class in college bc I hadn't done any real math like that in 6 years at that point. It was easy af and really helped bc if I jumped straight into college algebra I would not have done so hot. 

So after that prep class, I went onto college algebra and got a B+. I even scored 104% on one test. I'd never done anywhere near as good in high school. 

I also had to take statistics and business calc for my major. Stats was easy af, business calc kicked my ass ngl but I still passed. 

when I tell you I was ass at math in grade school, I mean I was ASS. I feel like as an adult I just developed a better understanding of numbers. I actually found that I enjoy financial math so I ended up choosing Finance as my major concentration. 

When I left junior college for university I knew that I wanted to put all my time and effort into this so I could reach the finish line as quickly as possible. I'm blessed that the school I go to now gave me a full ride as far as tuition room and board. I took out loans to cover my personal expenses for the year, so I live on a strict budget but its enough to get me through each term without having to work. I was able to get so much done compared to when I was in jc. The way things are going now I'll have to get a part time job but the loans really help keep me afloat so I can focus on school tbh. In my opinion and situation I see that its totally worth it lol. 

&#x200B;

It's ok to be scared. Going to college is a big decision. It leads you down a different path and starts another chapter in life.  But that's the thrill of it tbh. When I was younger the thought of leaving the comfort of my coastal california town didn't cross my mind. But before I knew it I was 21 and I felt like I was gonna get trapped in my hometown with all my high school classmates if I didn't change something fast. 

Step out of your comfort zone, go on this adventure. It's only gonna change you for the better."
college,fo7rc17,t3_g66fef,1587583213.0,"Damn I'm not too far away, I'm over here at UCR and word on the street is our chancellor doesn't expect campus to open for the fall. No official word yet tho."
college,fo7r2pt,t3_g674gc,1587583086.0,"Yoooo I was in a very similar situation when I was younger. Ended up all on my own at age 20. College has been taking me forever bc I've been trying to make it happen all on my own. I don't have my parents or anyone to fall back on really so I had to work for so long to keep myself afloat until I transferred to university where my basic needs are met and covered. So I'm finally able to focus on school and finally finish in less than one year from now. 

but anyway, I had a large gap between my last math class in high school and my first math class in college. I actually put off my math last bc I was ass at math in high school and thought I'd have to put in tons of effort to get it right. It didn't turn out to be too bad. I had 3 required math classes and only the last one (business calc) gave me any trouble, but overall still very manageable even after a long break like that. 

Financial aid varies from state to state and school to school. So I'd direct your questions to the financial aid office at whatever school you enroll in. To file independently under the age of 24 is a long process and a pain in the ass but it is possible if you've left a paper trail showing that you're all om your own without any access to your parents help. 

&#x200B;

Look into your local community college. Take some intro classes that you'd find interesting, you're bound to find one area that you're good in or really like. For me, when I was a teenager I wanted to be a journalist. Went to jc and after dabbling in a few fields I found out I really loved business. Now here I am about to finally finish. I couldn't be any more sure of myself rn. 

&#x200B;

Going back to school, especially after a break and at an older age can be daunting, I know. But you can't go wrong getting an education. It may take you longer than 4 years and that's ok. Good things take time after all. All said and done this journey after high school will have taken me 8 years. Sometimes I kick myself for not having it done 4 years ago like I should have, but I'm just glad I went back bc I'd rather be 26 with a degree than be 26 and be thinking ""damn I shoulda stayed in school I'd be done by now"". 

Go out there and give it your all. One term at a time. I know it feels like an eternity but I promise once you get the ball rolling and you're really invested in your studies, the time passes you by real quick."
