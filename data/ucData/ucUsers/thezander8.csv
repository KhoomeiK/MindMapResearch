UCDavis,fpj6vqf,t3_gdppgh,1588658356.0,"Wow dang there are a lot of apple people on here. What's your major? That will affect whether or not you'll ever run into issues going Mac. I don't have specific criticisms of them, but I personally haven't been swayed that they're worth the $1000, especially given the low requirements of your average college schoolwork and the omnipresent chance of it getting dropped or splashed with beverages. Windows is also a lot better than it used to be so I do think some of the Apple brand loyalty is inertia from the old days when Microsoft was putting out a legitimately bad product.

I had an HP Envy in my last year of undergrad and some of grad school -- it was great (until I broke it, but that was 100% on me). I thought HP did a good no-nonsense job of adopting the design elements that Apple does well (in terms of general sleekness) while also keeping the price reasonable.

I see the Envies are more expensive now, but I still recommend HP in general after using a couple more of their laptops after my Envy. For example, something like this with the screen upgrade option:

[https://store.hp.com/us/en/ConfigureView?catalogId=10051&langId=-1&storeId=10151&urlLangId=&catEntryId=3074457345619384322&quantity=1](https://store.hp.com/us/en/ConfigureView?catalogId=10051&langId=-1&storeId=10151&urlLangId=&catEntryId=3074457345619384322&quantity=1)\\

would be reasonably fast and suitable for pretty much any major unless you were doing some sort of graphics-heavy work.

Some things to keep in mind:

* You're gonna be spending a lot of hours looking at that screen. Size matters, but so does resolution. I personally don't like to go below 14"" or below 1080p if I can help it.
* 17"" meanwhile might be too big to fit in a lot of your standard backpacks/travel bags etc. Those tend to be made for 15"" computers.
* Some people prefer having a 10-key number pad on their keyboards. You're basically going to need a Windows 15"" or 17"" laptop to have that feature.
* Another option is to cheap out now and expect to upgrade. I linked you to one that is on the high end of the price range you had, but you could alternatively buy a cheaper model with a worse processor and screen, and just get another $400ish one a few years from now if lower specs don't bother you.
* Yet another option that I did my sophomore year was a desktop/laptop combo. Basically my aging laptop was just a note-taking machine, and I would do actual work on my desktop back at my apartment. Not as feasible in a dorm room, but good for productivity once I had more space. Midrange desktops can be in relatively attractive price/performance ranges, and building them is also an option."
UCDavis,fpj58qd,t3_gdntgu,1588656975.0,"> We both thought I had no chance at Berkeley. Now I don’t know where to  go. I feel like I am an idiot to turn down the opportunity to go to  Berkeley. 

You're not an idiot for thinking about turning it down. There are people around who chose Davis over Berkeley, myself included. It's a good school but it's not the right fit for everyone, and prestige is indeed overrated. Davis was a better fit for me for financial and logistical reasons, and on top of that I liked the town better. There are things I regret about the college search, but the Davis vs Berkeley decision isn't one of them.

&#x200B;

> I don’t have a plan or goal of what to do with either degree but I feel  like a degree from Cal is a valuable much more valuable than a Davis  degree. 

If you don't even know what field you want to go into or what major you'll be able to get into, then it's impossible to say whether a Cal degree will be ""much more"" valuable, or even more valuable at all. 

&#x200B;

> I want to be challenged and I feel like I will be inspired at Berkeley where Davis is the easy route. 

If you think Davis -- a campus in the same university system, accredited by the same organization -- is ""the easy route"" just because it's like in the top 5% of US universities instead of the top 1%, you're in for a nasty surprise. Your major and how you manage your time is going to be what makes it easy or hard. Also, Davis is on quarter system, which is a much faster tempo than Cal's semesters and faster than what you're probably used to in CC. I personally thought Davis was plenty brutal.

&#x200B;

> so I would be commuting to Berkeley. 

Well if you're looking for a challenge that would definitely do it, and not in a good way. If you run with the premise that Cal is more competitive in its coursework, then it's essential to find a study group and campus support resources. Also, you probably wouldn't be able to attend as many social and networking events as otherwise, which will limit your enjoyment of the college experience and also limit the alleged advantages you get out of Cal's prestige.

&#x200B;

> Everyone else in my life basically says Davis is a mistake and Berkeley is an inspiring once in a lifetime opportunity. 

I had this happen too. Generally these are people who are not super familiar with both schools who say stuff like this. Davis has its flaws, but those are intrinsic flaws to pretty much every big university. Like I said before, it's probably more important what you study than where you study it. I'm pretty sure I ended up having a more rigorous education with my Davis physics degree than my non-STEM friends who went on to Berkeley or the Ivies. I can run circles around some of the people in my current job -- more policy/consulting -- whenever we do quantitative analysis."

You can think of EMH as just arguing that within an asset class (most often we're talking about stocks) you can't predict which security will be better than others in the future.

MPT takes a step back from that and looks at the risk of the asset class itself and then assumes on average it will have returns that relate to that risk level. So in MPT you're not doing any selection based on which investment you think is ""better"", you're purely adjusting how much risk your portfolio is exposed to.

I guess you could argue that *technically* MPT is ""active"" in that it requires you to go to your broker's website and do some clicking to rebalance once in a while, but it doesn't require you to make judgement calls based on analysis.

I attribute his leaving more to the coaching turnover.

I understand that it would have happened at some point in the future anyway and the game still brings plenty to the table. But I heartily disagree that it *had* to happen now or that it was a net plus overall:

&#x200B;

> The game is already easy enough as it is.  Throwing in all the high-stat  pokemon with overpowered abilities from prior editions makes it that  much harder to create a game that can pose any challenge to the players  that bring them over while not making it too punishing for people that  dont.

This is entirely a self-imposed problem on the part of both Game Freak and the players. I guess the game needs to be mind-numbingly easy for accessibility -- though it certainly seems like older gens got by with more difficulty -- but a) players looking for a challenge can easily choose not to use their best team from previous games and b) Game Freak could have put some new mechanic to restrict such 'mon to postgame or require X gym bages before using transfers or whatever.

&#x200B;

> As far as rules changes, Gamefreak have made it abundantly clear that  they want to put as little effort as possible into making genuine  changes to how the games function.  They've sat on a goldmine of the  laziest design improvement ever for a decade so I wouldn't put any faith  in that stock. 

Totally agree. That's not an argument for the intrinsic merits of halving the dex though.

 

>I understand that there are some  players like yourself that just enjoy the breeding and exploring with  pokemon you've had since Gen 3 but catering to that kind of subset of  players rarely produces healthy design choices for games as stand-alone  products.

The game already stands alone for anybody who chooses not to use this feature. Like I've argued, additional tweaks and changes could handle the cases like mid-game transfers and PvP.

 

>My perfect Pokemon game would 100%  involve an entirely new roster of 100-150 pokemon with absolutely no  repeats because it forces you to treat the game as its own entity.

So I'm not super opposed to at least starting out with unique Pokemon -- I loved how Bl/Wh did it before opening up the dex in postgame -- but completely restricting transfers is just forcing everyone to experience the game in the same way. Also, you pretty much have the choice to do this already in the campaign. Nobody's forcing you to use previous-gen Pokemon on your story or multiplayer team.

&#x200B;

> Balancing a game for 800+ isn't just ""twice"" as much work as for 400.   It's significantly more difficult than a simple 1:1 ratio.  

I don't deny this. I would have expected Game Freak to eventually have to trim it. But to do it now, after years of development and a 50% markup on the game compared to the previous entry that did show most of that effort? Of course I'm going to criticize the heck out of the decision.

Early on I created a spreadsheet for which major classes were offered when for four years and which GEs needed to be filled. That included three summers' worth of classes as well. I think I had some alternate versions of the spreadsheet based on which track I was taking/ some alternate course options. Basically every class had to serve a purpose; I think I had less than 5 units total that didn't directly contribute to one of my requirements.

Day-to-day just required a ton of time commitment. Basically every evening my study group was convening to work on stuff, ranging from a couple of hours of problem sets to staying up well past midnight. Finding that group in the first place (friends of friends in classes) was huge and made studying a lot more enjoyable and manageable. Office hours were a must if they didn't conflict with each other.

And it's truly great -- having studied some stints in Westwood and San Diego too I assure you that Davis wins in terms of convenient and affordable stuff to do close to campus.

Not super familiar with the internship scene at Davis, though it seemed like most of my friends did get research opportunities (I had some campus jobs so I guess you could count me as well, though they were kind of niche and not the traditional research positions.)

However, as much as I think Davis is underrated, I definitely don't want to discourage you from UCLA. I did a couple of summers there (long story) and it is really spectacular. Sports are generally bigger there as well, if you're looking for that element of the college experience. (Though Davis sports were getting bigger every year until COVID.) The big thing there is living in LA isn't for everyone. Yeah there's a lot of stuff to do, but it's crowded and takes forever to get anywhere.

A lot of these costs don't go away just because students are gone. You still have to make sure the buildings are safe and functional for when students return. You don't want to lay off staff if you don't have to. They probably already bought a ton of supplies for spring semester before it was cancelled. The cows still need to be fed. Etc.

Students are still paying tuition, but they're not paying a lot of other fees like parking and campus housing. And they're not shopping at campus stores. And the UCD hospital isn't making money like normal because it's focused on COVID. Alumni might also be donating less due to the bad economy.

And on top of all that, the first-party games usually have gorgeous art styles that look and perform amazing while hiding the system's limitations. In a lot of the flagship Switch games it doesn't really feel like the Switch is underpowered, even though logically we all know that's the case."

I'm not kidding on this front, or at least on the ""first"" part. (Not every scene/effect is perfect in it, but what it did right it did *really* well.) Take a look at the 2007 Gamespot review, and bear in mind that their test rig couldn't actually run the game at max settings during those screenshots:

NintendoSwitch,fnno069,t1_fnmy1qe,1587096988.0,"I'm learning today from reddit threads that it's really polarizing. I loved it; the level design was incredibly open and I felt like I had a ton of tools and tactics at my disposal with the nanosuit powers. It heavily emphasized methodical gameplay, which I liked, but I can understand that it wasn't some people's thing.

Crysis 2 is almost the polar opposite where it's a very slick experience with smaller levels, a simpler suit UI, and better graphical performance. To me it didn't have the magic of the original, though I totally understand why some people preferred it. I think the sequel's existence -- a different take on the same concept -- causes people to further find fault in the original game, which is natural."

It had some sequels and a console port that improved performance  but never got the same rep. The series seemed to die out about 7 years ago. So this release is capturing attention for several reasons:

1. Some people, myself included, love the gameplay and are excited to get an optimized version on more platforms
2. The studio has had a history of producing cutting-edge graphics so it's exciting to see what they can do with modern software and hardware
3. Because of this, Crysis might be the most impressive-looking game on the Switch

However, I will say that when I took them all but the smallest seminars counted for GEs. So it wasn't like these were ""extra"" classes so much as classes of the types you would need to take anyway, just more rigorous in exchange for being more interesting and smaller.

Looking at the website, six classes over two years is not bad at ALL considering you have so much flexibility to schedule around them with your priority reg. Additionally, I noticed that there's now honors classes for major prereqs as well, which might give you a better environment to get a strong foundation in those.

UCDavis,fn8lxz5,t3_g09f2e,1586744678.0,"If they still have the honors dorm, I highly recommend doing UHP for the first year at minimum. I made lifelong friends the old honors program dorm back in the day with the added benefit of having a ton of study partners (same honors classes, deliberate choosing of other classes together because we all had priority). Afterwards I ended up getting an apartment with a few guys from the honors dorm, one of whom was in my major, which was insanely valuable for studying all four years.

At least when I was in it as well there were a ton of pre-med students there. Some would end up working in the same labs if I remember right. Getting extra chances to network with people with similar interests and career goals is always a plus in my mind.

UHP got less useful over time, but I still stuck with it for three years. The project management class led me to get an internship on campus and resulted in two of my letters of rec for grad school. I put it on my resume too, but have no idea if anyone cared.

For the record, a lot of us are not that experienced. If you do the math on people's ages then a lot of reddit's demographic wasn't old enough to have personally experienced losses in the last recession. So people who are accustomed to seeing profits from whatever strategy they used for the past decade are now bailing. For many that's likely based on emotion and/or concern about their financial security in the next year or so.

There isn't an overwhelming strategic reason why one would bail right now, as long as the money's not needed for a while."

The major difference is you can't program your Xenoblade AI members (they'll do whatever they feel like and occasionally give you the option to trigger a specific ability when ready) and you can't pause time when doing commands in XBC2. 

But the basic combat premise is the same; load up your party with skill sets and assign them whatever class you feel like, and everyone auto attacks with you occasionally triggering specific abilities. Occasionally you'll have options to do Chain Attacks which are roughly analogous to Quickenings, though their effectiveness is dependent on the combination of moves you've already used over the course of the battle.

It's actually a really deep system and really fun, though you only have it mostly unlocked 30 hours in or so and only really get to explore it without careful team building like 50-60 hours in."
