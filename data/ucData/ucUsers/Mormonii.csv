UCSD,fopm5a2,t3_g8q16g,1587965232.0,Why would looking on Chegg for homework be an issue? I obviously get on tests but why homework?
LifeProTips,fojvkek,t1_fojraof,1587830281.0,I think you might just have a confirmation bias here. Just because people in your circle feel that way doesn't make it that those who have a healthy relationship with social media are in the minority.
wine,fohs46p,t1_fohqbnc,1587771573.0,"Mataro is another name for Mourv√®dre. So if you've had a GSM you should be familiar with at least 80% of this blend.

Counoise is also a grape from Rhone that is used sometimes in Chateauneuf du Pape. Same with Black Malvoisie which is more commonly called Cinsault. Hard to find a varietal of either of those grapes though, they are mostly used for blending, and even then they aren't super common. I'm not sure why Ridge goes for using the less common names for the grapes though, probably a marketing thing."

There's his Instagram. His work is amazing. My favorite was his Mortarion he did a while back."
AdviceAnimals,fnikpfh,t1_fnhtnul,1586981674.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. Genuinely wasn't intending to be patronizing, just trying to be informative since I didn't know you were immunocompromised. Was just trying to talk in the context of the first comment that people who aren't immunocompromised should indeed be wearing a mask to protect others on the chance of being asymptomatic. Sorry for coming across as patronizing. Hope you are keeping safe and healthy in these times."
AdviceAnimals,fnhrjil,t1_fnhnee3,1586967600.0,Then wear a bandana or a scarf or something.
AdviceAnimals,fnhrcto,t1_fnhohh7,1586967509.0,It has nothing to do with protecting you from getting the virus. Wearing a mask slows down any bits of the virus you can be breathing out from getting on surfaces. Since so many people are asymptomatic it is better to assume you have the virus and therefore wear a mask to prevent you from getting it on any surfaces that someone else could then get infected from.
AdviceAnimals,fnhqu6t,t1_fnhkh8e,1586967252.0,"Exactly? I think that's what they're saying. If you're walking around you should be wearing a mask, otherwise you're making the problem worse than if you were walking around not wearing a mask."
AmItheAsshole,fnf9myl,t1_fnf8huu,1586903962.0,"True, but the whole point of her changing her name was that the spelling of it was not normal. Why change it from something that is very unusual to something that is still unusual just less so?"
asoiaf,fmm2i5r,t1_fmlhmsy,1586197574.0,I'm sure Dany assumed she would have full control of her dragons too and look how that's turned out.

AmItheAsshole,fm9rmt8,t1_fm9n9z0,1585875014.0,And doesn't being unethical make you an asshole?
