UCSC,forbf2d,t1_for7t5d,1588009381.0,the reality ðŸ˜”
thegarden,fo1f7dt,t1_fo1f3oj,1587431981.0,i dont mean it in a bad way but i think wyatt has more vocal range than fletch and it shows in his choices when he performs
thegarden,fo1f3oj,t3_g558xy,1587431920.0,"wyatt provided most of the vocals for the garden prior to mmsyc and kmsbr and i feel like he uses his throat more in his technique? i definitely feel like theres a deeper tone and more exaggerated pronunciation when wyatt performs. fletcher is a little softer and definitely more chatty in his delivery (i think all access is the first garden track where i was like okay that is NOT wyatt on vox)
idk if that makes sense lmao but i do hear the difference"
100gecs,fo03i7g,t1_fnyh4pt,1587405437.0,where did you get the bill with vaporwave sticker
thegarden,fnanwx2,t3_g01wdx,1586800749.0,i bought a Tighten The Reins shirt from fletch last year and it arrived almost 2 months late. emailing is your best bet. don't lose hope!!
UCSC,fnammnu,t1_fnalagv,1586800119.0,"nope, and neither have my friends. however, i found more info on [Oakes' page](https://oakes.ucsc.edu/residential-life/Room-Selection-Process-2018.html) about the application process and lottery system. so far the most transparent college resource, and i'm not even an Oakes affiliate. i imagine the declaration form will be sent out to us later this month (maybe not precisely April 21st....) and your whole group should fill it out individually. then, you are given a time slot on May 18th based on your points?? that's how i understand it. someone correct me if im wrong"
UCSC,fna6u5c,t3_g0l2bn,1586792133.0,make it make sense ucsc
UCSC,fna6d9q,t1_fna409h,1586791881.0,"now theres a button that says undergrad housing but when you click it, it says undergrad housing app isnt available rn?"
UCSC,fna409h,t3_g0knhw,1586790597.0,the app isnt even up F
UCSC,fmyuawj,t3_fy3rsx,1586495977.0,the sheer amount of places to explore in such a close proximity. meeting new people all the time.
UCSC,fmumyxl,t3_fxicvn,1586394595.0,"you can avoid smoking/drinking anywhere, not difficult to find likeminded people in that area (or at least people who wont mind it for you). cowell is more accessible than stevenson as far as location goes. porter is just as social but far more quirky artsy types. you might not need the bookstore as much as you think you will, so consider that (used books online / student prime is the way to go). porter is really close to the games+media labs afaik so that is a major plus (lmao) if you intend on sticking with that path. you may find more people within your major at porter as well (there were quite a few i recall). im biased because porter has incredible vibes but think about it obv. cowell and porter are two sides of the same coin, just depends on how much weird shit you want to encounter"
Psychonaut,fmqhi96,t3_fws3w4,1586299716.0,seriously bravo man. this is gorgeous. i would cop a print of this!! itâ€™s an extremely moving piece (-:

ApplyingToCollege,fmc1yv4,t1_fl0by83,1585937394.0,"itâ€™s a pretty small group of students who are equally academically driven and housed together at the four college choices (limited to Cowell, Crown, Merrill, and Porter. i was at porter). there are meetings with the college provosts, some required two credit courses (they fulfill GEs tho and are super easy), and you get priority enrollment for the duration of ur time in the program (-: ive made some of my best friends in the Scholars program and you cannot beat that priority enrollment (esp for CSE or other impacted majors)"
