AskReddit,fl1l9cg,t3_flt20t,1584731228.0,"I have a really bad housing situation right now and now we are a being forced to stay in the house together. We are 3 girls all in our 20s. I mostly hate being here and prefer to hang out with my friends outside of this apartment and play DnD ...but I can't now and I'm stuck having to be near all of them.

I know my situation could be way worse, and I'm blessed to have housing and a job that won't lay me off. I work in a nursing home so I HAVE to stay quarantined and isolated.  

Wishing good health to all of you."
