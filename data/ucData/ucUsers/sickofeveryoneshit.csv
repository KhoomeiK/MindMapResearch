I would look over your FAFSA to see if there’s any tiny detail that could be causing this issue. I also contacted the financial aid office for a different issue recently, and they got back to me within about a week :( I hope they get back to you soon, good luck!"

UCI,fo92021,t3_g64976,1587608745.0,"I’m a single mom and my 3 year old son is autistic. He has speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral therapy, and regular school, and due to COVID-19, they’ve obviously all moved online. His schedule wasn’t an issue for me before, but now that everything is online I feel so tired all the time. 

I’m extremely thankful that my son can receive these services, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say that it’s been so hard juggling all of my son’s online sessions while taking 20 units this quarter."
