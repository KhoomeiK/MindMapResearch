premed,fpmzv3a,t3_gebam4,1588746117.0,Health policy and malpractice law would seem like good ideas. It also just might be a personal interest or just to flex.
UCSD,fpmzl32,t1_fpmkn89,1588745897.0,"Like I said *some.* Most of the new friends I made here are international students and I get along with them. But I've had numerous experiences similar to the ones I mentioned earlier. My friends at other UC's never seem to have this problem but for me it's common enough for me to notice which is why I say ""a good portion of the student body is""."
UCSD,fpmhie5,t1_fpmgox7,1588733195.0,"If it’s lecture slides. I pause the video, copy the slides down, then listen at 1.4 speed."
UCSD,fpmc5zw,t1_fpm1p1m,1588729897.0,I commented on this thread about my experience with my suitemates.
UCSD,fpmc3eg,t1_fplvaye,1588729854.0,Wasn’t called the n word but 2 of my suitemates were international students from East Asia(Giving out their races might lead them to finding this because they’re from small countries) and they had some incidents where they said some shit to the effect of “wow you’re smart for an Indian”. Some International students tend to be a little racist imo(Asian/European) due to them coming from culturally and ethnically homogeneous countries.
premed,fpj533r,t3_gdp76e,1588656845.0,Happened to me first sem. Had a 95 and got some sort of D and dropped to a B+ with curve. I hope your curve does you better.
UCSD,fpj4ytm,t3_gdkhgj,1588656748.0,"UCSD itself isn’t racist. Calling a school racist is insane. However, a good amount of the student body is though."
medicalschool,fpivz3m,t1_fphattl,1588650000.0,"Trying your best often means doing something you don't like. I hate leg day but I had to in order to become a better basketball player. Not a fan of math or physics, but to create this video game I wanted to make I had to learn some. Similarly, those that want certain careers need to do stuff they don't like in order to get there. Sure padding your app to get into a great college won't guarantee that, but it increases tf out of your chances. Do you want to work at Goldman-Sachs? Good luck doing that with a degree from Chico State. It's possible but so much harder to do it than if you go to Harvard.

You do realize most of the kids on the r/ApplyingToCollege are just a bunch of sweaty try-hard bay area Asian kids right? Yes a lot of them are financially well off, but most aren't connected. They're the children of a bunch of immigrant Asians who think the best way to succeed in this country is through grinding through education. Why would the average Asian parent know a thing about ""research"". They're not being pressured by anyone to do research. They want to. Even if it's for a superficial goal of going to a good college, many wanted to do it.  Just like you did in order to get into medical school.

To address the ""If you just work really hard everything will work out"" part. Yeah, it won't guarantee anything. But you won't get anywhere by saying just bc I'm in a shitty situation I won't reach my goal. My dad worked his ass off to move from India to the US without a college degree, go through a shit-ton of hardship in the form of racism and lack of education, and finally work is way to where I live currently. Sure working hard won't guarantee you to be an orthopedic surgeon, but you're not going to get to that point without hard work.

You're 100% right about the gap in opportunity between low and high-income students. But if a high-income student were to perform exactly the same or worse as a low-income student, how would that higher-income student perceive themselves? The fact that they're given financial stability, food whenever they want, and their own bedroom, while the lower-income kid shares a 1 bedroom apartment with 4 other family members, and had to walk to the library to use a decent computer, would make the higher-income kid feel embarrassed. I know what if feels like because I am that higher-income kid. I was embarrassed because my dad worked so hard and I didn't. The other lower-income kid grinded his ass off and worked his way to a significantly better university than mine, and is now enjoying the fruits of his labor with a nice ass internship at a top tier company while I'm probably gonna be bagging groceries and overcharging rich parents to tutor their kids this summer."
UCSD,fpihw3j,t1_fphkp5f,1588641242.0,I'll see if I can finesse a good professor like Politz.
medicalschool,fph7k28,t1_fpgvrok,1588616357.0,"If you’re lazy in high school(like i was) it’s difficult to get good study habits in college. For many professions where you go matters a lot especially business and in some cases when you apply to medical school. I don’t see how trying your best academically is a bad thing. Maybe it’s because I came from a relatively wealthy asian suburb and everyone else seemed to be doing better than me because they tried harder, and as a result are doing really well now. My friends at Berkeley, Stanford, and UCLA are getting internships left and right despite the pandemic while the two offers I had got revoked(I’m a cs/bioinformatics major)

I’m advocating to try your best academically in hs and I’m getting downvoted tf."
medicalschool,fpgt1ji,t1_fpg0fyw,1588608990.0,Imagine thinking trying your best is sad. Why is it sad to be ahead of the curve and attain great study habits? Going to a respectable undergrad that will make it easier to get into grad school or get a great job.
medicalschool,fpgsmas,t3_gd7prb,1588608770.0,"I know high schoolers who have multiple associate degrees. One has one in cs, Econ, biology, chemistry, and math. And he’s going to Berkeley and plans to graduate as a double major in cs and biology in 3 years."
UCSD,fpgrr5c,t1_fpcgqj0,1588608313.0,My friend hated Gary but did well in CSE 100 and 101 and said his class was unnecessarily difficulty. But ig now I have to go with it.
UCSD,fpgrn97,t1_fpfm1rw,1588608256.0,I tried there too lol. It seems like no CC is offering it and some CCs have bugs in their schedule system where I can see winter 2020 but not summer 2020. It’s not even offered summer session at sd.
UCSD,fpdbojp,t1_fpd7g1y,1588523820.0,Ty I’ll check it out
UCSD,fpdblcy,t1_fpcbxfq,1588523770.0,Who’d you have for CSE 8B?
UCSD,fpdbgve,t1_fpc6ipz,1588523698.0,My friends that had Gary say that his class was overkill and if I take it in the fall I’ll probably end up with Gary(on capes Gary has almost always taught fall quarter). I’ll check out CCSF tysm
UCSD,fp4b5pq,t3_gb2qsc,1588295347.0,"Is it too much homework or is it too difficult? If its the former, I'm sorry for you as many sd professors think they're cool by assigning a shit ton of homework. If its the latter I recommend going to office hours. With it being on zoom now, we all have no excuse not to ask TAs all the questions we have. Most of the time it's just a free tutoring session with someone that's passionate about the subject we're trying to learn."
UCSD,foss5on,t1_fosof4j,1588036930.0,You didn’t get the big envelope? I thought it was bigger than most schools tbh
premed,fnlyrtd,t1_fnltuxv,1587062092.0,"I disagree. The professors at Harvard are academic celebrities. I feel the thing that's overvalued is the quality of students coming out. Yes, they're among the brightest in the world, but working with Harvard students their intelligence is definitely hyped up. At least the average Harvard student. Some are greater than I'll ever be and that's not a knock on myself but a testament to how crazy intelligent, socially and academically, some people are. Although you can find these sorts of people at any university, given Harvard's prestige and difficulty of getting in you're more likely to find these people at Harvard."
UCSD,fnlkclc,t3_g2a4tv,1587055025.0,that’s kinda expensive
premed,fnljw0m,t1_fnl9qmx,1587054803.0,That’s what we all say but would you pick the undergrad you attended/attend or Harvard University. Any job you want and pretty much any grad school you want.
bioengineering,fnctk9f,t1_fncg0eq,1586846744.0,"CS is definitely my safety net. The reason I'm specializing in bioinformatics was mostly that I still have a desire to become a doctor. My specializing in bioinformatics at my school I get to replace a few upper div CS courses with bio/chem/physics courses, so some of my degree credits will overlap with premed courses. If all my preferable options fail(medical school or bme/bioE ) then I'm going back to the bay and securing some sort of software engineering job. If that happens though I'm probably gonna be very bored for the rest of my life so let's hope that doesn't happen."

I was thinking about taking these two classes as it covers most of what you've said. Obviously, I'll teach myself the other necessary stuff but I want to take advantage of the great professors at my school's Electrical/Computer Engineering department. Thanks for taking the time and giving me advice!"
bioengineering,fnbxgof,t1_fnb5u35,1586824262.0,"Anything to do with the construction of medical devices, specifically ones related to surgery such as the da Vinci Surgical System. I want to start somewhere that I can get introduced to electronics and stuff and figure out where my computer science knowledge can benefit medical device projects and work my way to the point where I can contribute to surgical device projects."
UCSD,fn806f2,t1_fn5b7vi,1586731169.0,Or get a drawing tablet for 30 bucks
UCSD,fn803t1,t3_g02wmc,1586731127.0,Just major in gen bio and pick and chose the bio electives you want. General bio allows you take ANY upper div bio classes and is less restrictive. Neurobio(there is no neuroscience major aside from cog sci) and molecular bio both have more required classes and you have less freedom with what you can choose.

UCSD,flsla6x,t1_flm098s,1585444733.0,"You can change to any uncapped major during your time here. The closest thing to a typical pre-med major is Biochem in the Chemistry department which is hella rigorous(calc based physics+analytical chemistry).  You can try to switch over to Neurobio if you've finished (BILD 1-3, CHEM 6A-6C, and CHEM 7L). If you come in with at least a 4 on ap bio and a 5 on ap chem, then all you need is chem 7L to apply to switch majors. However, in my case, I still have to take the whole chem series since I got a 4 and Chem 7L."
