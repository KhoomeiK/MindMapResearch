I know saying someone should lose their job is harsh, but if you can’t do your job as a police officer correctly, you should be fired or go through some extreme retraining or something."

> If you're eligible, your system-wide tuition and fees will be fully covered by scholarship or grant money. The plan combines all sources of scholarship and grant awards you receive (federal, state, UC and private) to go toward covering your tuition and fees. Students with greater financial need can qualify for even more grant support to help defray other educational expenses (like books, housing, transportation, etc.)."

I saw a petition asking for a D- to count as a ""Satisfactory"" and that is way too insane. Literally just asking for a free pass at that point without any effort.

PS4,fpewg66,t1_fpeviwq,1588556430.0,"I’m not sure blind was the perfect word I could’ve chosen, but whatever. If you can think of a better word, feel free.

What I mean by it is, some people are buying the game based off of faith in the developers and are blind to the warning signs of the leaks. Either by not looking at the leaks or after looking at it, even though there are red flags saying it’s not a good decision. 

Not like they have zero information, but that they choose not to believe in it.

Kind of like how some religious people blindly believe that god will save them when there is a lack of evidence to prove that he exists(the red flag/warning signs), and in reality, it has always been a coincidence or luck. 

I hope I got my point across even with the horrible explanation."

They is some stuff that's reasonable to be angry about, but most people are angry about a certain aspect that isn't impactful.

To be fair, Captain Marvel is one of the worser MCU movies in terms of story telling(Like Captain America: First Avenger or Thor: Dark World). The Black Panther hate was unjustified and the movie was really good."
PS4,fpcc561,t1_fpbqfrw,1588495006.0,"Yeah, there wasn't any context in the leaks, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the information is true. 

No matter how much storytelling they put into characters, the events of the leaks are still going to happen. The events that were leaked is information that people care about and is what they will remember. The game can still be really good, but it destroys what made the original so good."
PS4,fpcbtpb,t1_fpbhd69,1588494664.0,"With it being Marvel, it was obviously going to sell well.

Obviously there are people who don't follow gaming sources on the internet and are out of the loop that buy the game. Which are a majority of people. So the game was still going to sell millions no matter what happened.

At the end of the day, the leak saved a bunch of people $60. 

I really want to like this game, but $60 isn't something to take lightly. I can't put blind faith into this game. 

Before it got leaked, I had TLOU 2 preordered and was hyped for it to come out and was willing to bet $60. Now, it would be a bad financial decision."

PS4Deals,fp8d70h,t3_gbc9up,1588389370.0,"These add 9.9mm to stick height. 9.9 is considered “high” within the websites filters. 

9.9 is a good height where I would say it gives a big improvement that’s noticeable. Kontrolfreeks have improved my aim so much, like maybe a 7-10% in accuracy

Personally, for KontrolFreeks, I think taller the better and don’t go for any special designs.
I’ve owned Vortex, Ghost, and SNIPER. I bought Ghost because I like Destiny. They put the shape of the shell as the design, and felt like it poked every part of your thumb.


I currently use the KontrolFreek FPS Freek SNIPER which adds 13.7mm which is the tallest out of their lineup and is no longer in their website, but can be found on Amazon."

To my knowledge, it's in the beta and it should prevent that.

Also, I can accept bad aim, bad strategy, bad headset, or bad communication, but sometimes being too bad is detrimental. 

For example, knowing the bomb is planted at A, and you're just standing in a corner on B clueless. Or always buying a shotgun or cheap gun. Like if you're absolutely new to shooters, there's a training mode... to at least become somewhat contributing"

Almost everyone i talk to is taking 12-15 units and don’t mind if it takes 4-5 years. Majority of the class does everything last minute and some people don’t even go to class.

I haven't played it, but I feel like it can't radically change enough to be worth $60 as if it was an entirely different game because it's still called FF7. 

If it's like how different FFXV is from Versus XIII, then I think it would be worth $60. I don't think it's worth any more than $40.
