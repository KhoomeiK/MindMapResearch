Everyone has their own little cabin in walking distance from everyone else, and we get to see whoever we want everyday or visit other old friends‚Äô Heaven‚Äôs. I‚Äôve always thought about it like that since my grandma died. I told my mom that‚Äôs how Heaven was so she didn‚Äôt have to cry, because it would be a while but she would see her mom again eventually. Prob sounds super cheesy, but I‚Äôve just always pictured it like that."
AskReddit,fnyu1qa,t3_g4ppga,1587375655.0,"California and homelessness. Good example of this is I tried to make a nextdoor post after I moved to Southern California asking what to do to help the homeless. Never expected to be attacked by dozens of people, calling me a child, stupid, a bitch, ignorant, etc for ‚Äúwanting to help criminals and crackheads‚Äù (their words).

I didn‚Äôt know that something as simple as basic human rights was so divided.

The country as a whole is incredibly politically divided it seems like. I thought everyone was kinda united w everything going on but now I‚Äôm seeing people protesting closed businesses and I don‚Äôt get it. We should wanna help people but I think selfishness gets in the way of a lot of that and it‚Äôs really depressing. Maybe that‚Äôs just my perspective, but everyone just seems to want what they think is best and a lot of people don‚Äôt research a lot of things for themselves."
UCSD,fnu4pyk,t3_g3xpkk,1587254511.0,"Totally not alone, and I think a lot of us agree. Being inside all day everyday kinda sucks, it gets old and feels trapped and incredibly apart from the rest of the world.

My home town is very small and kinda depressing (it‚Äôs a nice place and I‚Äôm lucky I got to grow up there, but it‚Äôs just really small and also isolating so I don‚Äôt wanna go back there); staying in warmer weather is basically essential to my happiness too. I have never liked cold weather/super cloudy day for long periods of time, so whenever I can here I like to just sit in the sun for a bit. If you have a balcony or a good window that helps, or if you wanna do outside and just take a short 10 min or so walk (w gloves or a scarf/mask/something if you can), that can really help w your sanity. Try not to think about anything, just how the sun and wind feels and just focus on you for a bit.

Facebook groups for the school have been very busy if you wanna do random zoom calls and stuff. If you like watching Youtube videos I 100% recommend watching Yes Theory. All of their videos are so positive and interesting and gives me so much hope/excitement/ideas for the world and life after I finish UCSD (super cheesy but their videos are genuinely great)."

AskReddit,fno2hkp,t3_g2xagv,1587109662.0,Idk why but some kid at my middle school bragged about if he would kill someone he would beat them with a bag of oranges. He said he could just eat the oranges after. I asked about the bag and peels and he said he would eat it all. Hope he‚Äôs doing ok lol

AskReddit,fmrz65l,t3_fx3u9k,1586340909.0,"Bad/WTF: I had a feeling he had cheated on me. I picked him up from the airport (we were doing long distance at the time), and something just felt off. I couldn‚Äôt tell what, he seemed fine and wasn‚Äôt acting different, and we had missed each other so I didn‚Äôt focus on it. We felt 99.99% normal, but someone just felt weird. I asked him if anything happened that I should know, he says no and seems genuine but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling. I kept asking every few weeks/months over the course of about 8 months. I kept trying to ignore the feeling but I couldn‚Äôt. We were talking one night and I randomly just started balling my eyes out, saying I feel like he‚Äôs not telling me something and my biggest fear is him hurting me like that because people hadn‚Äôt treated me well in the past (which he knew). We talked a bit and I went home for the night (this is when he was visiting for a few weeks). At 1 AM he came over to tell me he cheated on me when he was away. In October. Right before he flew home for thanksgiving break, and then lied to me about it for 8 months. Still probably one of the top 5 worst things that‚Äôs ever happened to me"

AskReddit,fmryiya,t1_fmrxe1y,1586340239.0,Strongly relate to the first two parts especially. I‚Äôm really sorry someone decided to hurt you like that. No one deserves that; I wouldn‚Äôt wish that kind of pain/betrayal on my worst enemy
AskReddit,fmry7ff,t1_fmrxxfb,1586339897.0,Don‚Äôt wanna be nosey but how did you work through the hurt? I was cheated on last year and most days I feel fine but some days it‚Äôs pretty clear how much it‚Äôs still affecting me in ways it seems like I‚Äôm repressing
