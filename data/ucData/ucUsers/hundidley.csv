AskReddit,fl1f12x,t3_flt20t,1584727703.0,"Asked a girl on whom I have a HUGE crush on a date. It's her fourth year at our university (my second) and she's moving back to her hometown after she graduates. My school moved classes online, so I'm back home and won't be back until next year. This effectively means I won't see her again, probably ever, and that hit me harder than it probably should've."
