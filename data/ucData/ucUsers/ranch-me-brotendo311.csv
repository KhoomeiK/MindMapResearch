ApplyingToCollege,fpixt3w,t1_fp74f2e,1588651287.0,They get less funding because it‚Äôs an undergrad focused campus of the UC system.

UCSantaBarbara,fpeanhz,t3_gcyvek,1588543716.0,"All of my friends and myself that got accepted into ucsb are incredibly smart and all have well over 4.0 gpa and 1400+ SAT, but there are just as many friends of mine going to SBCC because they didn‚Äôt care as much about academics in high school and only partied and now have rich parents that will pay for them to live in IV. I think this is why ucsb can‚Äôt shake the party school reputation."
politics,fpb24uw,t1_fpax5qs,1588460512.0,They are not left leaning they are right leaning centrists. How exactly is passing nafta and stacking your administration‚Äôs cabinet with wall street execs a ‚Äúleft leaning‚Äù thing.
ApplyingToCollege,fpat7sw,t1_fll8wq5,1588455214.0,UCSB is way more competitive lol. The ppl are still hot asf tho bc it‚Äôs socal.

ApplyingToCollege,fp93604,t1_fp928z3,1588412528.0,that‚Äôs what i meant lol
chanceme,fp8unvp,t3_fyilxm,1588403577.0,If you are in the top 10% of your class in terms of GPA then I think you will get into UCSB. You need to finish strong this semester regardless.
ApplyingToCollege,fp8njcx,t1_fp8jgn5,1588397182.0,my ‚Äústate school‚Äù is ucsb so i can‚Äôt rly complain tbh but i totally agree

UCSantaBarbara,fodcblc,t1_fnsvd5o,1587682893.0,"‚ÄúBut I mean, if hanging out with your BROS shotgunnin‚Äô beer on a Tuesday night and playin‚Äô sum DIE on the front lawn with trash littered about, or dancing to some HARD EDM and getting trashed on a Sunday morning is your cup of tea... do it?‚Äù

That is what I want out of my college experience, so I should rush then right?"
ApplyingToCollege,fo8c2cd,t3_g54wo5,1587593709.0,UCSD is best for CS. USC is prob the best school in general and the most fun.
malehairadvice,fnx5me8,t3_g455b7,1587331940.0,You didn‚Äôt shave your head though you have a buzz cut. It would look worse if you fully shaved your head because the hairline would no longer frame your face. The good news is when you see signs of balding you can just take finasteride and your balding will be slowed for at least another decade.
UofArizona,fnu7liz,t1_fnu4sis,1587256188.0,"He‚Äôs called for liberating states way too early against what Dr. Fauci would want. These states are going to see cases go up again and the situation will be prolonged. I live in CA and have confidence in Newsom to manage the situation and keep stay at home orders in place for long enough, but I can‚Äôt have faith in Trump and Arizona‚Äôs republican governor to have Arizona stay on lock down long enough to prevent coronavirus from prolonging into fall semester."
UofArizona,fnu4lbe,t1_fnu34c0,1587254441.0,Florida is reopening prematurely before they saw a 14 day sustained decrease in cases. Florida is going to see a jump in cases very soon and will be on lockdown longer.
UofArizona,fnu2zmw,t1_fnthjo7,1587253544.0,Not any state is even in phase 1 yet...
YangGang,fnbicat,t3_g0k1mr,1586816044.0,no one cares about the pope
YangGang,fn8zblq,t1_fn8w36k,1586754458.0,The catholic church abuse is not limited to a few bad apples. The abuse is so widespread and protected from prosecution by church leadership that it is clearly an issue with the institution itself.
YangGang,fn876yp,t1_fn86ohz,1586735366.0,The catholic church is a borderline pedophilia ring. That‚Äôs not very ‚Äúhumanity first‚Äù imo.
YangGang,fn7rcrb,t3_g02wdn,1586726078.0,who cares what the pope says
ApplyingToCollege,fn4n39c,t3_fz6nx9,1586644779.0,Putting in work in HS for awards is a terrible reason. You need to do it for yourself.
ApplyingToCollege,fmyedtv,t1_fmyc7j2,1586484199.0,Yeah but there are entire industries that you NEED to go to a T20 to get into for finance/business degrees. But for eng/CS you will be fine getting a job pretty much no matter what.
ApplyingToCollege,fmxgsqj,t1_fmxgp2q,1586464709.0,I mean like investment banking and finance shit. They seem to rly only fill spots from Ivies and t20s.
ApplyingToCollege,fmxfagj,t1_fmww2kr,1586463910.0,I agree especially for engineering or CS. The name brand of the degree really only matters if you are trying to become a white collar douchebag because those types of companies want to hire those that came from the same daddy‚Äôs money/legacy background as them.
ApplyingToCollege,fmxeiid,t1_fmxbx3t,1586463497.0,"Prestige is nice but only if you actually get in. At a certain point, you need to be a realist and think realistically about getting a degree and then getting a job."

ApplyingToCollege,fmnvflf,t1_fmnow74,1586236425.0,go to MIT pls
ApplyingToCollege,fmnvdif,t3_fw9eb7,1586236376.0,Dude honestly MIT and USC are both going to be equally hard and the learning environment at MIT will make it way easier to do well at MIT.
