premed,fpgxfqh,t3_gdewwa,1588611239.0,Leaving a comment because I am wondering this too.
ucla,fp4vm40,t3_gb9rea,1588308555.0,"So sorry to hear this. I hope you recover from this quickly, and I hope you don’t suffer a bit either. You can make it!  We are rooting for you!"
premed,fox5plb,t1_fox4w04,1588134718.0,Oh really? Dam misunderstood this for a while i guess. Thanks for correcting me!
premed,fox3jih,t1_fox2iiy,1588133221.0,"Yes thats ORM, over represented in medicine, but with your stats it really shouldn’t be an issue, definitely not with 50 apps! 

What you describe about the letter writer is definitely sus. Unless he is one to prewrite them, that isnt usually how letters go.. 

Ill dm you later when I am free to discuss."
premed,fox28h4,t3_ga204t,1588132343.0,"Bro. WTF. Im so sorry to hear this. This is the shit that scares me. I have the same MCAT, higher gpa (dont think it makes a difference tho). Similarly research focused, but with less than a third of the hours, and in wet labs.  Didn't apply yet, but now I think I am so fucked. Are you ORM in Cali, qualify for FAP, how much clinical volunteering did you do? Honestly it could be a letter thing, do you think one of them was a bit shakey?"
premed,fonnk7z,t1_fok53xc,1587922894.0,I wouldn’t take P/F if its a premed prereq unless you have to due to some life circumstances perhaps. If its an unrelated non science school prereq I would consider it.
Mcat,foliqte,t3_g80css,1587863103.0,Yo. I had 5 shots of espresso . WIRED. In the middle of CARS I had a moment of derealization.
