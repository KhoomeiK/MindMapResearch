Not that 1 should necessarily be viewed as worse, it’s up for debate. But I don’t think it’s “apples to oranges” in the sense that they are totally different, when they both took similar numbers of younger people from their families."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpevtm0,t1_fpevd52,1588556038.0,"Ya I get your point. I agree with you completely, I say what I said in the context that I also think school shootings vs driving deaths is a worthwhile comparison cause one is much more preventable and harmful, even if it seems less scary. I think the emotional lens is usually not as useful."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpevin5,t1_fpesfha,1588555849.0,"A. Those things happen every year and are unavoidable. This happened along with all those other things still happening. Obviously there are tons of other huge causes of death, but under 65 alone was 8000 people. That’s still pretty rough. 

B. On the racial divide, of course rates matter as much as shear numbers. Losing a larger chunk of your community is incredibly hard. The “there are way more white people so it’s actually not disproportionately affecting minorities” argument hurts my head."

A different situation, but the lives lost metric is pretty comparable. Not in the similarly scaled but able to be compared.

neoliberal,fpe7vfp,t1_fpd9zbd,1588542114.0,"BFS and DFS have a big O of O(V+E)/O(n). So obviously either is right, where both represent basically a linear array search seeing as the tree has a h=2, since all naive search algorithms are O(n). Traversal is O(logn) in a binary search tree, but only works with some form of > < = comparison. Obviously you were just joking, just think it's an interesting challenge, especially to facilitate the government actually digitizing records. 

If you expand this statement to the actual context of searching for a key phrase in a large number of documents, this situation becomes far more difficult, as you are searching a key phrase in long documents, although admittedly avoidable if you have a title which is formatted in a way that your search term would be in a small range. 

In the field of text search, one subtype of tree is exceptionally useful in storing text data for many documents, enabling quick querying. A trie, known as a suffix tree, is used to set search complexities to O(length of search phrase) instead of being related to the document length. Building these is slower though so it would only work if the government decided to store them in this way ahead of time. Also parallelizing this would be super useful as well, and combined would produce a pretty efficient algorithm. 

Unfortunately the clock rate of government employees is abysmal, and they don't have enough cores to see substantial gains from parallelization. I'm guessing the program would always time out."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fp7t6pg,t1_fp7pv8l,1588377276.0,"Ya I agree with a lot of what you’re saying, I just don’t understand how you could possibly organize people well enough to understand that, let alone carry it out, without the government catching on really early. 

The main point I’d make is the entire fucking world relies on the US for economic stability, especially large corporations. Threaten that in any real way and every corporation will bring in the fullest extent of their surveillance capabilities to help the government. Everyone’s data privacy will vanish unless you’re using proper encryption. Reddit will start handing over the ips of leftist subreddit users. The list goes on. Couriers solves a lot of these issues, but I’m just skeptical of the opsec difficulties of all of this. Especially when these types of crippling raids on data centers, weapon caches, etc would need to be so quick so amazon or the government doesn’t just ship all its data to overseas data centers (which I already would assume exist. 

I’m not saying this cause I’m glad the government has absolute power over the population, but I just don’t think any of this works without massive planning and strategizing that the government would catch onto far too early. This scenario only works if something so egregious happens that the military turns against the government. Obviously there’s always a chance, but damn if I would not want to be involved in that kind of blood bath. I think many will end up like that isis fighter who posted on 4chan and was swiftly droned.

You don’t sound like you love him and your response has likely killed a lot of his confidence and made it even harder for him to get into sex. 

If you care to fix this, talk to him kindly and tell him you want to help. If he really thinks it’s low t, just get him to a doctor to check. Random changes in sex drive aren’t normal, and could be indicative of many medical issues. Talk to a doctor and stop assuming he’s lying."

The US government doesn’t know shit going on in the region. You can hide in a cave and they will spend 5 years looking for you. Locals won’t talk cause they hate us, and they can’t get the government to trace calls or anything. 

In the US, they can pull your phone records, hack your computer, look through the billions of surveillance cameras, and just generally stomp out any decently sized resistance. You can totally be a terrorist and randomly blow stuff up. But if you want to organize an actual revolutionary body to build a new society, you’ll end up droned so quick.

AmItheAsshole,fp1feac,t1_fp1co6e,1588233668.0,"There’s my exact point. Calling it “paying for animal abuse” is how I view it too, but it’s not realistic to think the rest of the world does. If you instead lead with things about the health benefits, environmentalism, etc, you can get more people to cut down on meat consumption. 

As soon as you tell someone they’re a monster for eating meat, they will write you off as a crazy who is not worth listening to. While I won’t excuse anyone who responds by doing the opposite for spite, id just use the analogy of politics. Explaining to someone why a policy or candidate is good will always work better than trying to shame people into voting for them. 

I’m not saying that you’re making more people eat meat. I’m saying that you’re making an admirable and responsible choice as a vegan, and by being friendly and open about it without resorting to insults, snobbery, or absolutist statements, you can open up more people to the idea of changing their diets. You’re not “causing harm” in the sense of killing more animals, but you’re missing out on awesome learning opportunities. And even marginally reduced consumption will do a ton of good.

It’s unfortunate things are so normalized, but changing your entire diet is difficult, especially if you are not very informed about food and nutrition. Small changes show that going totally vegan is doable. If you actually care about any cause, I suggest you not act like an asshole about it. More animals will be saved by cultural changes, not a small movement of vegans. If everyone ate meat only a handful of times a week, it would all be raised much more ethically and would be few fewer animals suffering. 

Btw if it’s not clear I’m using you as a generalization, not saying you do all of these things."
FinancialCareers,fp143wn,t1_fp11gvi,1588223867.0,"How many famous or successful politicians went to UH, and how many at Penn? Or successful entrepreneurs if you want to filter out nepotism and whiteness?

I completely agree with you that the elitism is insane, but I’m not buying the 3.9 is 3.9. It’s not apples to apples, and if you’re at a non-target I would expect you to have something truly exceptional cause there are 20000 A students in business schools around the country/world. These are the most desirable jobs and there aren’t many of them. To truly evaluate everyone in enough detail to weed out which of those is exceptional is really difficult, especially when the intelligence they’re after isn’t high enough that you can quantifiable judge a sample of work like Google can. So they’re forced to rely on your academic history. 

Finance is very easy to learn, but top business schools all grade on curves. A 3.9 at Wharton means you’re among the top students at Wharton, which were already among the smartest students in the country before college. That is not the same as someone acing finance classes at some random state school. It’s elitist, but true. The biggest thing though is the need for absolute drive and consistency. There can’t be any mistakes or slacking from ib analysts, and they are expected to grind like crazy. 

Students who graduate spotlessly from a top ivy have consistently been excellent their entire lives. If you have done this but choose to go to an average university, it should be easy to tell from your resume. You would be top of your class, incredibly accomplished in on campus organizations or other projects, or otherwise been a noted hotshot. Cause just getting A’s isn’t enough when you take all the 3.9s from all the colleges. 

To condense this, my point is that they aren’t necessarily interested in good students, the work isn’t hard. They’re looking for broadly intelligent, driven, and motivated people. You cannot get into and graduate with distinction from a top university without having maintained this type of life since birth basically. That’s a good sign you won’t buckle under immense pressure and workloads. It’s elitist but it’s pragmatic. They need perfection, not genius. 

This is very different when you step outside finance majors imo, since things in stem especially are more standardized in rigor."

If he comes back to being vegan, he is still a part of the change that needs to happen for animal rights and the planet. Maybe slightly less than you, but 99% better than the rest of the population. 

The biggest issue here is you seem to have no ability to understand he can make his own decisions, and is not beholden to you. This is a global crisis and he made a personal decision.
