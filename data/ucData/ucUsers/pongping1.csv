buildapc,fngboth,t1_fng5rd4,1586927446.0,"Realized that the splitter is PWM, and one of the fans is PWM but one isn’t. Should I configure the fans differently?"
buildapc,fnftr14,t3_g14drf,1586915283.0,"So I bought I fan splitter for my pc because I had 4 fans but the MB only had 3 slots for them. But after I installed it and check the fan speeds, the one with the fan splitter was not reading stable numbers it would really fluctuate between about 600-1000 rpm while the other fans were stable around 650rpm. Should I be worried about it or is there something I can do to fix this? (When I only had 3 fans w/o the splitter the fan speeds were pretty much identical)"
