DecidingToBeBetter,fncosb3,t3_g0ifcq,1586842488.0,"I know it might sound weird, but playing League of Legends is really helping me. When this thing started I kinda ran from the country i was doing an exchange program and self isolated myself alone for 3/4 weeks now. Playing some League and CS with friends has really helping me keep my sanity and some sort of schedule, like ""I have to finish this before 9pm so I can join the match"". It is better than before where I was kinda sad and anxious and sleeping all day"
