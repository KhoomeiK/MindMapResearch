Here are my suggestions: 1) Go to a park nearby, and find a table with a bench if you're really really desperate, **2) Set up a seat on the floor of your room or on a chair in your room, and buy a lap desk from Amazon (these really work well),** or 3) tell your family to shut the fuck up unless they want you to fail school."
