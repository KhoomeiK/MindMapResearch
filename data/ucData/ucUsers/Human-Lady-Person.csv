TrueOffMyChest,fpi9qvw,t3_gddd3r,1588636496.0,"I don’t think we can stop by racism by ignoring the part of our brain that divides us v them constantly. I think we progress as humans by realizing our fallibility and holding ourselves accountable. You aren’t a bad person; you’re just a person. And you’re aware and catching those thought patterns so that you can examine and counter them bid everyone could do that, it would be a very good thing."
SatanicTemple_Reddit,fp6yn47,t3_g9uswj,1588360889.0,Just got my copy of the economic impact payment letter. I’m surprised to see no Absurd Punctuation or misspellings. They did fit in a “tremendous.” I read it in his voice. I think I’ll burn it.
UCI,fos1nvn,t1_forrnyk,1588022350.0,"Please don't beat yourself up or hold yourself to an unreasonable standard. I don't really think it's fair to expect folks to find productive uses of their time when experiencing a very frightening and upsetting global crisis. Please be kind to yourself. This is a difficult experience, but it affects different people quite differently and you have every right to feel what you feel."
AnimalCrossing,fog4sec,t1_fog4hd6,1587747882.0,It’s disappointing. I’m trying to not dwell too much aside from posting here for the catharsis and to help others avoid this. I was concerned about this too and knew it could occur. It’s a good reminder to be cautious.
AnimalCrossing,fog4bwv,t1_fog3pom,1587747704.0,"That’s very kind of you, but I think I’ll just work on growing them again. I have enough basics to start over on that. Thanks for the kindle offer, though."

politics,fnlhqcv,t3_g2ddu8,1587053754.0,"It's pretty weird that we even have this tradition of treating spouses of elected officials as officials themselves. I mean, I kinda get it.... hard -not- to have a person married to a leader like that not end up playing some role.... but at the same time, they're just the spouse of the person we elected! In what way does that obligated them -or- indicate they are qualified for some official role? I wish we could just get rid of the whole out-dated tradition. There's also the weird sexism of it with the expectation of female-coded stuff (e.g. sewing, care-taking)."
Futurology,fnbx227,t3_g0ivwj,1586824031.0,"Also bras. Can those pls be optional? Some folks are more comfortable with them and others without, but it feels compulsory..."

TrueCrime,fmu0jp9,t3_fxdqkf,1586382337.0,"I'm currently listening to Teacher's Pet and it's definitely among the most fascinating true crime podcast series I've listened to so far, but I see you've already listened to it.

Others include: Cold, Atlanta Monster, Casefile True Crime, The Clearing, Criminology, The Dating Game Killer, The Generation Why Podcast, Mens Rea, Scene of the Crime: Delphi, and True Crime All The Time"
