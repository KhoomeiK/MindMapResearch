for my genetics class a majority of the class wasnt able to finish a portion of our assessment that was worth 30% of our grade because of the time limit and that it required an upload. (IE professors should have large windows for assessments/assignments on a need basis)


this wasnt even a proctored assessment. imagine the problems surrounding it if it was zoom and proctor U slow down the already slow and sluggish work horse of a 20$ Walmart router that i have.



For departments. yes. i think pass no pass should be instated. **now** . waiting till later in the quarter to announce it will just be a larger pile of anger and problems for the school to quell.
