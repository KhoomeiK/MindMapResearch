AskMen,fp3jm3p,t3_gapp1o,1588280447.0,The difference in tone between this post and the r/askwomen post of the same topic makes everything so much funnier
radiohead,fp1camj,t3_gap349,1588230810.0,This is the lowest I have heard his voice for a while! It feels a lot like a radiohead song but also a bit like suspirium. It’s beautiful as usual
AskReddit,fp1agfy,t1_fp14wfd,1588229166.0,"The only way I have ever enjoyed mayonnaise is when I use it to sear, since it’s so damn fatty. Searing your steak in mayo or coating your grilled cheese in it really changes your life. Otherwise, mayonnaise is disgusting. I mean, it’s disgusting no matter what, but I have my reasons!"

AskReddit,fp19021,t1_fp0typh,1588227891.0,"My mom is Filipina American and my dad is white but raised in a Mexican American neighborhood, and one thing they will never agree on is how avocado is supposed to be used! 

I grew up with my mom giving me avocado mixed with milk and sugar, and on the other hand my dad slathering guacamole on everything we own.

AskWomen,fp0cnw7,t3_gaas77,1588206711.0,"Prague. It’s lauded for it’s beautiful buildings, but this being my first time out of the US (and as a teen) I was honestly disappointed. Yeah, the buildings were breathtaking, but the people were rude as hell, food was ass, and I’ve just never been one for places that are really touristy. Also a lot of people I know got pickpocketed, but that’s their fault for not being diligent I guess lol. 

I’m still very lucky I had the opportunity to go with my school’s symphony and and perform, but all in all I would definitely not return."
