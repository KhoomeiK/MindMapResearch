UCSD,fnpvzgp,t3_g37zv3,1587153007.0,I don’t want to even P/NP writing courses. I’m concerned that some medical schools count P grades as  Cs and I’m worried that will lower my gpa a lot. And not taking P/NP looks a lot better.
UCSD,fnk9c2m,t1_fnk7ujr,1587019003.0,Thanks for the advice!
UCSD,fnk9bdf,t1_fnjzz1e,1587018985.0,Thanks!
UCSD,fnjtbju,t1_fnjt1f3,1587006508.0,Oh okay. Thanks!
UCSD,fnjsb7t,t1_fnjs242,1587005842.0,That makes a lot of sense! Do you know any upper div human bio courses that have a good amount of overlap?
UCSD,fmvlz08,t1_fmurr8x,1586421866.0,I know! I’m also having trouble keeping track of assignments. My professors have been so unclear in explaining every type of assignment we need to do. I don’t know if I’m missing an assignment on some days. Figuring out everything we need to do for our classes is difficult in and of itself! It shouldn’t be like that!

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji

It allows you to block social media websites like YouTube or Reddit. You could set it so that it blocks social media for a set amount of time or you could create a schedule for each day that blocks social media during certain hours. I’ve used it several times to stop procrastinating. You can block the google chrome extension page so you can’t get rid of the extension during the time it is blocking specified websites.

Edit: You should also put your phone in an inconvenient position when you want to work. Put it in another room so you’re dissuaded from stopping your work."
