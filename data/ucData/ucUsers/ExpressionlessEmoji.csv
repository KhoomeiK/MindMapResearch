UCSC,fpicsnf,t3_gdkqgo,1588638262.0,"As someone who was involved in UCSC's SUA and now involved at UCLA's USAC, the two campuses have different issues. At UCSC, it is a lack of participation, while at UCLA, it is the divisive nature of the elections. Regarding the North campus (Liberal Arts) and the South Campus (science majors) at UCLA, it is the same at UCSC. Most science majors are unable to participate because science majors require a lot of time for class work, labs, and research. And especially for undergraduates, if you get involved as the President of the student government, it won't help you for medical school, nursing, or whatever STEM related field. Writing a research paper would be better for your resume."
ucla,fpfm3tm,t1_fpflkc0,1588575542.0,"I sit on the UCLA Academic Senate Committee on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion as one of the undergraduate representatives. I think many students do not know about the Academic Senate because it is designed as the ""government"" for the faculty members. It is how faculty members can voice their opinions on issues like admissions, diversity, and academic freedom. I highly suggest that if you are interested, or if anyone is to look into sitting on one of the Committees next year. Similar to other appointed positions, you are appointed by USAC members, but you get to represent your own community and your own views. I personally have been working on finding ways that the University can mandate pay for all research assistants, since research have shown that a lot of communities of color can not get involved in STEM because of the high cost of labs and supplies. But other issues I have worked on is removing SAT/ACT Essays and a stronger academic freedom so we can have professors from all political spectrums. 

Also, depending on your committee, it can also help you get involved and meet with faculty members and Vice-Chancellors."
ucla,fpfhiw4,t1_fpfaj3p,1588571417.0,"I think the people on Reddit have some good objections. And criticism from Daily Bruin and other sources about the failure to meet campaign goals are alright and needed in a Democracy. But I think many people on Reddit do not understand that 95% of the members in USAC, the staffers, and the interns are not paid workers. They are volunteers, who aren't involved in campaigns, do not come and go by who is elected to office. They stay around because they have a record of being successful and passionate about their work. So when people attack the staffers and interns, they often get angry. Imagine volunteering at Red Cross or the UCLA Hospital and someone criticizing you because your boss charged them for the surgery they needed. You will get angry, and you will get defensive. That is human nature."
ucla,fpbm6jj,t1_fpbj95j,1588473238.0,">Hmmm okay well I’ll just play devils advocate i guess. It’s probably cuz even the normal general elections that happen every year BARELY reach like 25-30% voter turn out and last years was especially heinous it being like 14? So in that sense, if it was at 50- pretty much no referendum would ever pass? Even if it truly was for the betterment of students/campus. So in that sense the optimal level would probably be 25% or so?

It is a referendum. It requires 50% + 1 to pass. And since it is a UCLA election, it requires 20% of the undergraduate student population to vote to pass. I don't know what the OP is talking about. I think the OP thinks, mistakenly, the requiring 20% of student population to vote, is the same thing as the 50% + 1."

Financial Aid and Scholarships will be represented on the task force, and we will make all efforts to ensure that awards are disbursed as quickly as possible to as many needy financial aid recipients as possible.

>Orion’s original statement still holds true. CUB said all students that receive financial aid will feel a net zero impact, which is false.

That is just not true. 72% of UC students get financial aid, but 57% of students do not pay for tuition or student fees through Blue and Gold. The University of California subsidizes the 57% through endowments, state funds, and other resources. Only 15% of students who receive financial aid will need to be supported through the referendum. Every single referendum at every UC requires 25% to go back to financial aid and it has a historically successful way to make sure those who need the aid do not pay additional fees."
ucla,fovn5ty,t3_g9ttz2,1588104140.0,"His post is incorrect. It fails to understand the financial aid program. Those who are on the Blue and Gold Opportunity plan, families with less than 80,000 a year have their tuition and student fees covered by the University. That removes a huge portion of those who get aid from financial aid. 57% of all UC students have the Blue and Gold Opportunity plan. 

Also, the State Governor does not allow the UC to increase tuition, including student fees without the UC getting penalize. This is because when the UC increase tuition, Cal Grant cost goes up as well. The State requires the UC to have a net impact when student vote for fees."
