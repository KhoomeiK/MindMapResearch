ucla,fpf66p8,t3_gd2kws,1588562742.0,"Around the world, every grad school is going to understand what took place in March of 2020 and the effects of it on every student. This quarter is kind of everyone‚Äôs free pass. A lot of professors are giving extended time on finals, allowing internet use/open-notes, and even collaboration. Even though that, if you still aren‚Äôt performing as well as you‚Äôve liked and your department is letting you take classes P/NP, do it. This is the one time you can do it. You can explain on your application why Spring 2020 was hard for you and led you to take this class P/NP. They will understand;"

ucla,foxbjmq,t1_fox5k7i,1588139119.0,"I mean, it‚Äôs still an opportunity to get antiquated with the work load/get ahead... it won‚Äôt be the same but it could facilitate your transition to college level learning on zoom for fall"
ucla,fosqdep,t3_g965o0,1588035879.0,I took it online with him last Spring Quarter and took very detailed notes for every lecture. Didn‚Äôt do much self study outside of that and my discussions were online but we were only able to communicate via chatbox (wasn‚Äôt Zoom) so I‚Äôd often zone out unless I had a question. Also the quiz questions are similar to the exam question format!

ucla,fo3u43t,t3_g560g9,1587492978.0,"EFC:0, initially denied on March 26th bc I still had $500 in unused loans (used the other loans on study abroad last summer). I asked if I could take out the loan this quarter and they re-offered the loan to me, along with the $1000 grant on the same day. I still had my housing contract at the time but I moved off a little over a week ago."

ucla,fnrtnh7,t3_g3hvk5,1587201128.0,"I absolutely LOVE my iPad!! I‚Äôve had it for almost two years now, and I love how I can import slides and write on top of them. Also, it really came in clutch for the past finals season as I was able to download my finals and do them on my iPad. On days when I don‚Äôt need my laptop, I just bring my iPad to campus and my backpack is so much lighter. I bought a keyboard that came with an Apple Pencil holder, which is something I recommend as well in case you want to have a wider range of typing capabilities. The app I use is Notability, and I like it because the notes are automatically backed up to Google Drive (after the initial setup).

Overall, I absolutely recommend."
ucla,fnqrjvr,t1_fnqrcl0,1587170665.0,There‚Äôs a MacBook Air that‚Äôs under $1000! I had to get a pro tho bc I code and shit and I had my old Mac for like 9 years sO I needed hella memory.

ucla,fnjnkal,t1_fnhsust,1587002765.0,"Granted this was probs bc he was a terrible lecturer during his first quarter but would give these gr8 review sessions like 2-3 before midterm 2 and the final. However I would fully go to lecture and learn nothing and leave confused. He probs has gotten better since fall, but I had him for 5C and got a B ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
ucla,fn7px7x,t1_fn5s39m,1586725250.0,I would say def know how to answer the HW questions and reason through why each answer is correct once you‚Äôre allowed to review. In my opinion the hw questions are like max difficulty and the exam questions are either at that level or less.
