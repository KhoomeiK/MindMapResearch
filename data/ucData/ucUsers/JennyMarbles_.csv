ucla,fnt22ki,t1_fnt1bng,1587233125.0,"> It is important to remember that when these referenda were put onto the ballot they didn't expect to be in this situation. And so, I prefer to provide them with some leniency on that matter.

As far as I know the referenda were approved for the ballot earlier this month. And it was just last week that USAC endorsed it. All this in the middle of the crisis. Why give them leniency? They've actively chosen to proceed with it during the worst of the crisis.

Regardless of whether they anticipated the pandemic or not, they had the option to pull back or postpone the fee increase proposal at once in light of the circumstances. That's a weak argument for the fact that all parties chose to go forward and approve it amidst the pandemic. Even if the referenda were in planning for a long time before COVID-19, nobody forced them to still go through with it once shit hit the fan.

Also, why is this being downvoted? Is USAC back at it with its vote manipulation? Lmao"
