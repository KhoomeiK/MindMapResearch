There’s a lot of super dedicated players who love the game and play for many many years that can barely afford premium time... players from Brazil and Venezuela are suffering a lot Rn, lost count of how many Brazilians have told me that they got laid off from work and are thinking not buying premium time anymore to save their hard earned money. Mind you, The dollar to real (Brazilian currency) is about 5.7 exchange rate. Making it super difficult for humble players to afford PA and some TC’s for a rush. So many players tell me that they literally farm imbue items for three hours a day everyday just to afford premium time. I’d say, do something where they can submit some kind of essay or video showcase, pick some scholarship winners and sponsor them a bit. I’d say that’s a lot better than spending all of that on store outfits and such plus you’d be doing something never done before on a 20 year old (or 15?) game. Just please think about using that fund for something better than just blowing it up on Tíbia store, there’s sooo many awesome players who rly love the game that r struggling bc of this pandemic and fucked up exchange currency rates... 

REMEMBER: what makes Tíbia an awesome game Is bc of the COMMUNITY!!! Reach out to me if you want I’d love to brainstorm ideas with you. I’m a UCLA grad student in sociology so I’d love to help out w my skill sets :) so many friendships were born in tíbia, relationships that last a lifetime. Imagine if you could help out a struggling player stop grinding for imbues to be able to pay for a PA and just enjoy the game as a whole while not focusing on a three hour per day imbue grind... 

SZILLER HERE HAIL OLERAAAA BEST COMMUNITY BEST FOLKS <3 help the communityyyyy"

TibiaMMO,fnxi2kw,t3_g48ruz,1587339074.0,I’ll never financially recovered from all these t3 imbues
TibiaMMO,fnry3nn,t1_fnr0rn6,1587206050.0,thought they were donating 100k euros?
ucla,fnk7gbm,t1_fnk6sfr,1587017274.0,Yay. Seems like I loose more and more faith on USAC’s legitimacy as a democratic body of governance... oh well.
ucla,fnj7p0g,t1_fnihr86,1586993538.0,"Could they ignore the results of the referendum even if it goes against it? And if they do so, wouldn’t that be sufficient reason to somehow report them to higher ups for voter suppression/manipulation? Interesting"
ucla,fniqyzk,t1_fniqkb7,1586984813.0,The good ol “everything will be reimbursed as long as you keep the receipt...”
ucla,fnilk9l,t3_g1xqfx,1586982101.0,"Isn’t the existing budget enough? If it isn’t, then I’d be logical for them to have a serious in depth look at how they are spending their own insanely large budget. How about the good ol lead by example?? Give up your own paychecks funded by student fees, if all members gave up their checks for a single year it should be enough to get the building started and perhaps change the general body’s mind about the legitimacy of this org to begin with. Doesn’t take a million+ dollars to build a single room. Why should students trust this org to handle even more money if they can’t even use the existing budget properly? USAC members when they flex on their good deeds “we have decreased the price for laundry machines and gave y’all free blue books, be grateful!! Don’t you love Bruin bash?!” Is plain ridiculous."
ucla,fng5qru,t1_fn0eekv,1586922980.0,Been in UCLA for three years and I still don’t know what Bruin bash even is. I’d like a refund please 👀
ucla,fng5l3j,t1_fng1ffm,1586922870.0,Let’s not forget retreats/trips all paid by your student fees :)
ucla,fng5d5t,t3_g1i25k,1586922718.0,That’s like... real freaking messy. I’m broke as shit rn maybe I should join USAC and get a lil piece of this chaotic cake eh
ucla,fnc2pt8,t1_fn1a79w,1586827370.0,"Last I checked with my three years working in construction, doesn’t take a million and a half in student fees to build a single room. Unless y’all trying to build a whole freaking building. USAC has a huge budget, throw themselves “events” and nice paid for vacations meanwhile y’all asking for more money. How about not taking the stipend for a year (100k$) cutting back on unnecessary costs that has nothing to do with the greater student body and that should cover the room/space yall r so fiercely advocating for. It does not take a million and a half to build a single room. Plus, make it student led. Wanna cut down on labor costs? Do some of the labor yourselves :)"
ucla,fnbredx,t3_g0pz3d,1586820822.0,Wtf is the pledge fee even for?

TibiaMMO,fln6qn0,t3_ffkke0,1585310901.0,"Heyo! I’ve been playing in olera for two months now it’s been awesome, players are super nice Nd I’ve gotten tons of help! This random level 650 put all t3 incumbents on my elvish bow just for the pure joy of helping... needless to say, the bow is a blast! I have an RP 47 and a MS lv 91. The one thing I wish it would be easier to find is other players around my levels to do tasks/hunt/quests with. I literally only team hunted once I think? It’s rare... I’ve also seen a comment of joining a guild which is something I haven’t thought of. But anyhow, I’m considering leaving the server since hunting solo with my MS has become to be v wasteful and it’s making me dread the game... the RP in the other hand much more fun and enjoyable, I still wish I had a crew of lowish players to explore the game with since I am just coming back after 9 years of not playing."
