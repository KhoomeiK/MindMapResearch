TheCloneWars,fph7x5j,t3_gdcv2u,1588616539.0,I finished watching Rebels 2 weeks ago. Man I wished I waited until after the last episode Clone Wars episode lol
UCSD,fpdwpqo,t3_gcghg8,1588535759.0,"So racism is prevalent at UCSD? I feel like I can deal with everything else, but racism. It just sucks. I transferred in from a local college and our college has a big issue with racism among students and even faculty. It made me miserable being there. I was hoping UCSD would be different"

CODWarzone,foo3g90,t3_g8i5cb,1587931749.0,haha. I started using UAVs a lot more because of these type of situations. Once my group were just chilling in an area waiting for the circle and it was pretty quiet. I accidentally used my UAV and it turns out there were 3 different squads below us who came after us once we ordered a weapon drop
gaming,fokgvoy,t1_fokerik,1587841833.0,"The other day I went chasing a lone sniper after I broke their armor into a small house since I was pretty close to him. I had an smg ready to finish them off and they completely shred me with the akimbo snakeshot with 2 clicks, even when I had full armor. And that was when I learned this weapon exists lol"
UCSD,fohxr5d,t3_fi9kzn,1587774697.0,"Transfer Computer Science Major (Muir)

Hello. I got accepted and I am pretty excited. Is there anything I should know before facing UCSD? I was also thinking of taking a Summer class to get one of Muir's required classes out of the way"
CODWarzone,fohh82y,t3_g7dr7p,1587765943.0,"I used to have this problem whenever trying to load into maps and it was frustrating since I bought the game after downloading Warzone. I did try  solutions such as deleting some files and then scanning and fixing but that didnt work for me.

I think the problem was I was missing assets of the game since i only downloaded Warzone, rather than the entire game. What I did was I uninstalled the blizzard client and I also uninstalled the game. I reinstalled the client and the game and I ended up having to download 120GB of the game, instead of just 90 GB when I only had access to Warzone.

I am not sure if uninstalling MW is necessary, but I only uninstalled was because I was a bit frustrated. I am not sure why the blizzard client wouldnt give me the downloaded I needed to play multiplayer maps after buying the game"
TheCloneWars,fnuc98j,t3_g3t5ju,1587258956.0,Ive rewatched the episode 3 times. Really enjoyed it
CODWarzone,fnuc222,t3_g3p4y3,1587258844.0,Before I would get around 100-120 FPS in Warzone. Now I get 60-90. Weird
sandiego,fnso488,t3_g3jj8k,1587225539.0,Yep and sometimes I lose connection to internet for like 10 minutes. I am scared that  I will lose connection in the middle of an online exam/quiz and not be able to take it again lol
assholedesign,fm2fihm,t1_fm0abvw,1585696455.0,Same. I returned MW because my game wouldnt load into multiplayer maps and I tried multiple possible solutions but none worked so I returned it. They were pretty quick about it too
