UCSantaBarbara,fnckm6p,t3_g0v3kk,1586839169.0,none of them are easy per say. 102 is a fun class but centers around phylogenetic trees so if that’s not interesting to you then you’ll probably have a hard time. haven’t taken 159 but heard it’s a lot of memorization. i’d suggest taking classes that catch your interest and ALWAYS look the professor up. it makes all the difference. hope that helped!
