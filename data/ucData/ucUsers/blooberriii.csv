ucla,foyz1by,t3_ga5xoz,1588181811.0,"if it helps, there are a TON of sublets for (relative to usual LA/Westwood housing) **dirt cheap.** My friend found a *single* right next to campus for $900. The upside of this whole thing is people still have leases, and after those leases end I imagine even landlords will be reducing prices."

ucla,fomvw5k,t3_g8cdoo,1587905481.0,it means whoever went through like 2 years ago and changed all the doubles to triples by awkwardly cramming a very obviously different set of furniture in the corner of the room will have to go *back* through and undo all their handiwork
ucla,fnkuxnp,t3_g1xzay,1587040611.0,i think you spent more time on the formatting of this than i have on any of my readings this quarter

trees,fnabpqd,t1_fn9z5m8,1586794673.0, probably like 3/4 gram? it was 25.5% THC. I tend to have a pretty high tolerance for how infrequently I smoke and how short of a time I've been smoking but that shit did me in lmao
trees,fn89r1i,t1_fn89iwk,1586736911.0,holy shit this is beautifully appropriate

trees,fn86jzy,t1_fn7sufv,1586734977.0,"to be fair, i am also prone to panic attacks when sober and i'd also had kind of a lot of coffee, so this is definitely at least partially from me just being neurotic"
trees,fn7pmo2,t1_fn7o41q,1586725085.0,"i think the real moral of the story is yes, ""just finishing the roach"" *will* make a difference"
ucla,fn309pr,t1_fn2dk49,1586609343.0,"i'm **already** starting to get these comments from a lot of my older/more conservative relatives, especially those who don't live in or near hotspots. sigh"

rollerderby,fmvzccw,t3_fxeojk,1586435696.0,"I painted my first pair of black Riedell R3s white and added little fruits and designs to it. This was 4 years ago, and I've since upgraded everything in my setup except for the boots. absolutely love them. I used Angelus leather paint and sealant, and the only places it's come off are where it's been slid against concrete in a fall. 10/10 would recommend."

Embroidery,fmp8isl,t3_fwlne6,1586276397.0,I have been wanting to do a van gogh piece for SO long–– how did you go about it? Did you block out areas to do in certain directions or just freeball it
EntExchange,fm7ozxf,t1_fm7olmh,1585833489.0,Totally fair (see my above comment about the price)! Sadly because my state is on lockdown I don't have access to the ceramics studios for kilns :(
