UCI,fnawqug,t1_fnar7ym,1586805179.0,"I can give a little insight into why I care. I currently do some form of counseling work at UCI. Before COVID went down and stopped on-campus work, one of my main duties was to learn about resources available to students that they can use whether they want to succeed in something, or use if they are in distress. After a couple of counseling sessions, I found that these student based organizations like CSWHP, CCC, Womxn's Hub, SOAR, and a lot of other places matter plenty to a lot of faces on this campus. Hurting student resource centers like this take away a belonging to a lot of students, and it would also promote similar action to be done in the future (last part is IMPO)."

Also do everything you can to get the highest GPA possible this quarter. Trust you're gonna need it for the appeals (coming from someone who had to appeal getting disqualified my 1st year which granted is slightly different but it helps!). Best of luck! Also you ain't a trash Anteater :)!"
