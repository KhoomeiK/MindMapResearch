college,fp7owyr,t3_gb1bzy,1588374799.0,"So I was going to take the fall off in the interest of interning full-time somewhere since I only have four classes left to take to graduate and don't want to graduate early, but considering internship programs keep getting slashed left and right I started reconsidering it.

Then I got my financial aid package for next year and it ended up being 154% more than I got this year, basically making it so I only have to pay $2k for tuition and my cheap (for the area) housing costs (which I have lowered by working for my housing provider). I also think I'll be able to get a need-based scholarship from my housing provider on account of the increase in gift aid I'll be receiving.

I decided to add a minor that will require me to take four more classes. This way I will have four more chances to boost my GPA, forge relationships with professors and TAs, and interact with other college students (even if classes end up being online). I'm afraid of not being able to find any job if I'm not in school, and at least if I'm enrolled I can continue working at my work-study job whether it's remote or not."

berkeley,fp0kt2s,t3_gakgl5,1588211271.0,"You can convert $4k of the loans they offered you to work-study funds on CalCentral. Unfortunately with this you wouldb't be able to get the money all at once, but at least you wouldn't have any interest to pay.

What I'm about to write below sounds like an ad, but I can promise you it is not. I'm bringing it up because I recently talked to someone from the company on the phone about signing up for the program, and he told me they prioritize students whose main or only option is high-interest student loans (so not even me).

There's this company called Florian that does income-share agreements, meaning alumni give money to current students to finance their education, interest-free. You just have to pay a percentage of your income once you get a full-time job after you graduate (so you can go to grad school and do something like Peace Corps without having to worry about paying the money back). 

Also, if your income is low enough you don't have to pay anything back until it's high enough. I'm not sure, but I think you're only expected to make payments for a certain number of years after graduation, so eventually you won't owe anything back even if you didn't pay it all off before that time. I highly recommend at least looking into it."

Imo it's a little disingenuous of them to advertise that price without any explanation of how they calculated it since, from what I can tell, most people don't stay in the co-ops over winter break.

Total Cost for 2020-21: $7,704

$7,704/8 months = $963/month

$7,704/9 months = $856/month"
berkeley,foe0sp8,t1_fodt7ps,1587693803.0,"Living in the co-ops was basically the first time I lived away from home (I did work/live at a summer camp before fall 2019, but I don't count it that much since home was <1 hour away so I went home every week on my day off and prepared meals and such were provided for me.)

Anyway, I would say it was a lot harder to adapt to being a student at UC Berkeley than living in a co-op. Maybe I'd feel differently if I had ever had a more traditional student housing situation, but I love my house and (almost all of :) my housemates. Some of my best friends are people I live with. I think this also depends on which house you live inâ€”mine is small, and I picked it for that reason specifically.

I would say yes, it's worth it. Even though from time to time I do come across cheaper options than my $937/month, they almost never include utilities [whereas co-op rents for the houses (not the apartments) does] and never include groceries. Yes, five hours a week of chores is a lot, but I figure I'd spend that much time a week cleaning, cooking, and shopping for myself had I chosen to live in an apartment. 

Also, I'm a major manager at my unit, and that has the benefit of counting for a few hours of workshift a week (so I can do more mental instead of physical work) and reducing my rent a sizeable amount. So I'm actually paying <$937 a month.

I just remembered another cool thing about the co-ops: who gets which room is decided by seniority points that you gain from living in the co-ops. I will probably get a single this fall if nothing changes, and that is amazing because I have never seen a <$937 single room in Berkeley."
