adhdwomen,foyj567,t3_g9u829,1588173466.0,"Literally me when I got my psychiatric referrals for ADHD meds... Kept putting it off, but then the phone call took only a few minutes, the return call wasn't long either, but then I had to wait 2 weeks for an opening (which means calling sooner would have resulted in going on meds sooner)."
UCSD,fnmqjd3,t1_fnbgb73,1587076251.0,"Hi! Marshall student here (as sunset\_in\_g\_lydia mentioned) and first off, the colleges are completely unrelated to major! Your lower division courses can cross over and meet GE & lower div Major requirements, but other than that, classes are completely separate and based around the college's philosophy.

**Here's some useful links for AP's and GE's:**  
[https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/pdf/APC-chart.pdf](https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/pdf/APC-chart.pdf)   
[https://marshall.ucsd.edu/academics/general-education-requirements.html](https://marshall.ucsd.edu/academics/general-education-requirements.html) 

The chart tells you what classes your AP's cover, and the Marshall page tells you your exact requirements. Marshall's GE's definitely aren't as dense as those in some of the other colleges, and AP's can help you meet a decent number of requirements (depending on which ones you took). 

**Personal examples:** Calc BC (3) got me out of the 2 course Math Requirement and into MATH 20B or MATH 10C, AP World (3) got me out of the 2 Lower Div Disciplinary Breadth classes, and AP Psych (5) got me out of Psych 1 (but that didn't help with my major or GE's, since I'm a Psych major and it wouldn't be ""Disciplinary Breadth"").

Marshall's writing sequence is required (**DOC: Dimensions of Culture**), but it's only **3 quarters** (better than ERC/Revelle's 5 quarters) and fairly interesting depending on your level of interest in history or social issues. GE's as a whole usually only take **about** **2 years max** to complete (if you take them all together and are mixing in major classes as they arise). I'm personally spreading mine out a bit so I have some easier classes over my third and fourth year.

While not exactly an engineering-oriented philosophy, Marshall's GE's could be useful as potential resume/CV content. Not every person exits college having taken courses focused around diversity, equity, and inclusion, but nowadays that knowledge is incredibly useful in the workplace!

Hope that helps, let me know if you have any other Marshall q's!!"
UCSD,fn4l7g4,t1_fn2qz2e,1586643660.0,"Hi! Fellow Marshall student here, and based on my experience the second highest plan has always worked best if you're not an avid cook (which I think rn is the $3400 plan). A lot of freshman buy the biggest plan but end up not spending it all, so with this one you should be covered for the whole year! It also runs over into the following Fall quarter (so you can still spend remaining dollars in the summer and fall), and if you ever run out you can always buy more! They'd never just cut you off lol (that was one of my freshman fears).

As for where to cook:  the Res Halls sadly have no kitchens, but there's a community kitchen under the nearby dining hall Oceanview Terrace (I think you just need to reserve it; also OVT has great custom pizza!) and there are small kitchens in some of the campus resource centers! But the easiest option will probably be finding a friend in the Marshall apartments (or requesting to live in one yourself). The apartments each have their own kitchen, and while it's mostly second years, some freshman usually end up living there as well. Once you start meeting more people in Marshall, it's not hard to find a friend whose space you can borrow. :)"

UCSD,fmx0wks,t1_fmw6jv7,1586456486.0,"I'm afraid there's no corresponding position to ours for grad school (they only have undergraduate tour guides for some reason), so we can't refer anyone specific, BUT I'm sure you can get some answers by starting a grad school question thread! (I'd also ask the page admins to see if they could boost it for more answers.) Grad schools are also more spread out than undergrad, since they admit within departments vs to the school as a whole, so I think starting a thread for your department might also be best.

Sorry we can't help out more! Tbh I've been thinking for a while that we need grad-school-equivalents for Campus Ambassadors (I've had a fair amount of grad students on my tours with questions I sadly can't answer), but my department is only in charge of undergrad outreach so I don't really have much say :((

I personally have friends from club sports in the education, chem/biochem, biology, structural engineering, and nanoengineering grad departments I can refer if you have any questions about those :)"
UCSD,fmwyr4z,t1_fmrfn28,1586455393.0,"Just to reassure, if your course description is almost an exact copy of a course offered at UCSD/another UC, there's a VERY HIGH chance it will transfer over. Admissions Officers have also voiced that if it's a universal class, like ""Calc 1/2"" or ""Intro Chem,"" they typically transfer over successfully (so I assume the same would apply for Calc 3). It's still not a guarantee, but this can help give you an idea of how likely your courses will transfer over."
UCSD,fmlpaxs,t3_fw0ugo,1586190731.0,They sent an official email like a week ago saying it was going to take up to five weeks. Not surprised.

I also suggested having Club Penguin nights, but they didn’t schedule any :(("
