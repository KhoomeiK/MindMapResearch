ucr,fpl0hn5,t3_ge2qmd,1588704217.0,"To add to this as a CHASS grad instructor: I can affirm without a doubt that a good number of instructors are just as stressed and as lost as students are. We're dealing with new conditions that have never been a problem to us before, and while the younger instructors, myself included, may be adept at online instruction, we can only do what we can at the moment, including if we get radio silence.

Message us, Zoom call us, if you feel comfortable. Let us know how you're doing or if you're struggling to get through the work. Unless we hear any criticism, we can't adjust, as we can only assume that what we're doing is working. I know I post recorded lectures, answer emails all day, open myself to zoom, and try to put readings into perspective, but that's all because it's what I know works for me.

If you need to drop, do so; if you need to change the basis of grading to S/NP, let us know; but also be sure to tell us if you really didn't understand last lecture, so that we can try and help you earn the grade that you deserve for sticking through these moments of chaos."

As well, some programs need you to be graded on an A/B/C/D/F basis in order to recognize you took the course and got credit, so while the S/NC may help you get the course on your transcript, some may see such credit as ""They took the easy way/they're covering for themselves/etc."" It's not fair, and it's gross, but alas, it's tied to education's belief that credit should be given to those in particular circumstances...not accounting that, like this pandemic for instance, somethings happen to all of us.  


If you need the credit for a program, then I'd suggest talking with the professor, an advisor. If you just want it on your transcript? Take the S/NC, but do look into it and see whether or not or how UCR will recognize it."
ucr,fokn3pu,t3_g7qi64,1587845169.0,"I can only speak for the course that I'm teaching (grad student, English), but I try and let my students know every lecture recording to email me questions and/or make zoom appointments because, alas, part of instruction as you point to so well is explaining things for each student. We need to hear information in a way that makes sense to or works for us. I can explain body paragraph structure in a way that I understand it, but unless someone tells me they don't get it, or asks if I can put it another way, that material may not get to said student, and then we're in a problem.  


I only wish you the best, and if I can, recommend you get in contact with your instructor if not send another email to check in. We have to know what's up, of course, but sometimes we forget. I can't say anything for CHASS staff, but know that some professors do want to hear from you (because honestly, explaining things to students is a way for us to feel like we're doing something, helping). Hopefully this helps??"
ucr,fo7yesk,t3_g67rl0,1587586685.0,"I know that there are some writing across the curriculum courses taught by the UWP, but those are tied to English credit. I would try contacting your advisor if not look to the course catalogue and your major. Who knows!"

ucr,fnwzqda,t3_g3u1vg,1587328647.0,"One of the things I had to learn the hard way during undergrad at UCR was that in college, you don’t make as many friends as much as you did in high school. Instead, the friends you have are deeper, stronger friendships, if not different kinds of relationships that are much more adult in nature.

Maybe you have a classmate you share lunch with one day, or someone you sit next to every day. Maybe you don’t have friends, but you have a study group in class. Maybe there’s a professor you have who is much more of a mentor than expected. Whether or not friends happen, college is a time for you to develop yourself and learn new things about you and your major. Hearing this from my Mom, a widow, I didn’t want to accept it, but she was right. 

While friendships may not happen like they used to, if at all, it’s not because of you, but because everyone is trying to do their best to set their lives up for the future—and hey, maybe that can allow you to develop an online pen pal group, knowing we’re all in this together."
ucr,fnm9vqf,t3_g2gune,1587067625.0,"I would suggest emailing or getting into contact with Sheena Thrush of the University Writing Program (UWP in as far as your English requirements. She would be able to look up your information, see how it covers or works with the requirements, and perhaps give you a direction to work toward. If anyone would be able to say whether you had to take English 1B, it'd be her."

ucr,fm1lxoa,t3_fs6oxh,1585680818.0,"As a grad student, I'll say that this is alllllll true, and that folks should take it easy on their instructors, especially grad ones. A decent amount of us deal with mental health issues just the same as everyone, and teaching is one of the few places that give the lot of us something positive to hold onto."
