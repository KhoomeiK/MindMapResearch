FIFA,fpmvvdb,t3_gee1ew,1588743130.0,PL is listed first before Saudi unlike the community which was listed after EFL. Should be out tomorrow. Hopefully only an 86 squad.
fut,fpm8mxt,t1_fpli27g,1588727806.0,Maeda is a beast for me
soccer,fplinh2,t1_fplgg4l,1588713392.0,"Well that was before a global pandemic, his injury, and having only 1 year left on his contract. But keeping trying to bring down fans of other clubs while you have no flair."
soccer,fplik2b,t3_ge5qvh,1588713343.0,Sigh

soccer,fp2h7dl,t3_gas9vu,1588261701.0,"If this season is declared null and void then you really have to feel for Man City, Pep, the players and their fans who where on course for a Treble this season and  are the only club to have actually won silverware to this point. Set to be the biggest losers through this crisis!"

StarWars,fo8swga,t1_fo8rypo,1587603158.0,Why do they feel the need to add that though? Why does Lucasfilm say “We are going to make a female centric show?” Instead of “we are going to make a new show.” It shouldn’t be about ticking boxes and identity politics.
soccer,fo5ycnc,t3_g5ka5d,1587539777.0,"Taking a 3 month break in the middle of a season ruins the point of a season. Any momentum and form built, injuries, contracts, and other obstacles teams face are essentially all messed up and left to an unfair mess. I don’t think the season should just resume in a few months."

soccer,fnoy0h0,t1_fnoxqtg,1587135738.0,So a year break in between the season? Contracts will have expired. It may not seem like a big deal in the prem but a lot of players are out of contract in the lower leagues.
soccer,fnoxfdi,t3_g324zy,1587135422.0,Null and void. In California they say no sports till 2021. How can sports be played if the virus is still lingering? There are still new cases in China everyday (and they are severely lying about the severity of it). This season and the next season will probably be voided. Just give Liverpool their stupid title and move on.

UCSD,fnagr20,t3_g0ddny,1586797223.0,"Nope. The problem is that a lot of universities will start in June, and I don’t think they will be able to start in person by then. It will probably start online because UCSD will just copy every other university."
FortniteLeaks,fmu977u,t1_fmt9yp1,1586386903.0,Yea but TikTok was free
