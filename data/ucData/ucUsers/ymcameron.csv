tumblr,fpc23xo,t1_fpbztpk,1588485170.0,"After years of waiting finally, yes. If you’re new to the series I’ll say what is pretty much required to any newcomer: the first few books are rough. Jim Butcher was a pretty new writer when he started the series and relied pretty heavily on noir tropes. One of the tropes he relies too heavily on is the treating of women more like things that Harry thinks he has to protect rather than actual characters. It’s real bad. Like, I started re-reading the series recently and woof. Around book 6 is when the series really comes into its own (there’s 15 books with 2 more coming soon so that’s not as bad as it sounds) and honestly I would just jump into the series on that one. It’s called Dead Beat and as long as you read a summary of the first few you’re totally cool to start the series from there. I really wish that I could recommend all of them, but the first few just have not aged well at all. This is a pretty hot topic in the fandom, and I understand that there are those who disagree with my stance, but I feel like in this day and age the first few books just come off as so “nice guy” (even if it was potentially written that way as some claim) that they can turn a lot of potential fans away from an overall fun series."
tumblr,fpbxrlh,t1_fpbpneb,1588481535.0,"I love that the Dresden Files adresses this. (Because of course it does, that book series is meticulous in its magical/physical rules being consistent) There’s a wizard who is really good a shapeshifting magic and Harry wonders how he’s doing it. Since matter cannot be created or destroyed, how the heck is he getting bigger with a larger mass, or smaller and losing mass?

television,fp7dt4t,t1_fp6z303,1588368747.0,"The basics are there, space-weirdness, cults, etc. but the majority of the story is about racism and uses those things as more of a metaphor to explore the main theme. That being said, don’t worry. Shit gets WILD, and judging by the trailer they’re leaning even more into the otherworldliness."
television,fp7diau,t1_fp6p2qo,1588368588.0,The book uses Lovecraft and his themes as more of a metaphor rather than being a straight adaptation. There are still cults and monsters but the crux of the story is about racism. In that way when the otherworldly parts happen they are more action oriented than the others because at least the main character knows that he can fight them. The real horror comes in the form of human interaction and the racist ideals of the regular old humans. It’s a great story that turns Lovecraft’s ideals on their head.
television,fp7cyjk,t1_fp6nvy1,1588368296.0,"The book imagines a world that is simultaneously “ours” while also being a world in which Lovecraft was at least partially right, just wrong on many of the details. The book is more about the horrors of racism and art vs artist while also having evil cults and monsters present. Don’t worry though, just because it’s dealing with that stuff doesn’t mean it ignores its influence. Things get WEIRD, although it’s always more action oriented than horror because the horror aspect comes from the human interactions rather than the unspeakable terrors."
