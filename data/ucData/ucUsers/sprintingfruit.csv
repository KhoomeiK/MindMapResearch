ucla,fni0yjr,t1_fnh1gak,1586972133.0,"Council voted to put the referendums on the agenda last quarter bc the deadline is the end of the previous quarter. 
The vote last night was to endorse the referendum bc Eboard sent out specific rules on how council may endorse a referendum."
ucla,fngy2dg,t1_fngxmpd,1586949135.0,"CUB stands for Cultivating Unity for Bruins. They have social media on fb and ig.

The mechanism of fee increases is not a USAC vote. First, a fee must be drafted and submitted with appropriate paperwork to the Election Board. Then, the fee language is sent to UCOP where they ensure that it doesn’t violate any policy and that the amount of the fee can actually accomplish what the writers are setting out to do. In order for a fee to placed on a ballot, the fee writers must obtain 10% of the undergraduate signatures or they may ask council to place the fee on the ballot. Typically, council will place the fee on the ballot bc the manpower to gain 3k+ in-person signatures within a few weeks is just impossible on a volunteer level. Finally, students vote on the fee during the election and it passes by a simple majority.
At no point does USAC have the power to increase or decrease fees by voting."

The pamphlet has a graphic on page 7."
ucla,fngvyms,t1_fngvp0e,1586947001.0,"I’m here providing information so you can be informed. If you want to address council about our conduct then you’re welcome to come to council and give public comment.

You do have a choice? Your choice is to vote “no” in may. No one has taken that away from you"
ucla,fngv7km,t1_fngtmy3,1586946199.0,"I genuinely don’t know where those numbers came from but here is official info. https://asucla.ucla.edu/v2/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ASUCLA_AnReport_2018-19.pdf

Again, this isn’t a USAC referendum so the burden is on the CUB referendum campaign to put out information. Many of the concerns that I’ve seen on reddit are easily answered by the CUB FAQ. Part 1 is out and they are releasing more soon"
ucla,fngsh9k,t1_fngonl4,1586943287.0,"Would TSC rent matter to you if you knew that they would have to shut down in two years bc they were only allocated 13k from the BRC to cover operational expenses and 0 to cover rent?

We are one of the few UCs with an transfer center and the leading university in the nation for transfer students, so it would be a shame to see the center shut down bc admin doesn’t care about funding transfers anymore."
ucla,fngryr0,t1_fngl0vt,1586942740.0,"To address the edit, yes! All referendums are legally binding and you can find the breakdowns of past referendums through DB articles and student government accounting records"
ucla,fngr6fm,t1_fngqzri,1586941909.0,Aren’t you and others asking for transparency and clarification? Is that not what I’ve been doing? Part of my job is educating students on USAC and where your money goes. Would you rather have me answering your questions and correcting false assumptions or doing nothing at all which leaves you in the dark about what’s going on in your student govt?
ucla,fngqvfj,t1_fng9zmx,1586941590.0,Bro I literally addressed this exact comment on a different thread. Keep copy pasting I guess  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
ucla,fngl0z4,t1_fngk9b1,1586935647.0,You made the point that allegedly USAC members don’t support anything that doesn’t benefit their wallets so it’s relevant that the money actually never goes to USAC
ucla,fngkdx8,t1_fngc6j2,1586935044.0,"After an incident of extreme racism in the chat, we decided to limit access to people that we could validate as UCLA community. Our meetings are only public to those in the UCLA community and this has been enforced in prior meetings. This means having a full name on your zoom account, and/or contacting the IVP for access. It’s really unfortunate that this happened tonight"
ucla,fngjqng,t1_fnge9h7,1586934443.0,"I mentioned this in another thread but the two referendums voted on tonight are not run by USAC and the money does not go to USAC. Council members will never see any part of that money. CUB is run by ASUCLA, MO coalition, and TLC. GCGP is run by good clothes good people."
ucla,fngj2kg,t1_fnggonk,1586933826.0,"As a point of clarity, Robert applied early decision so he found out about a month ago"
ucla,fngh15z,t1_fngg0oy,1586931970.0,"There hasn’t been an increase in student fees in several years and students at UCLA already pay the lowest student fees by far across the UC system, so I’m not sure where the first part of this response is coming from. As I’ve stated before, the vast majority of USAC budget is immovable and not discretionary. We cannot fund this referendum through USAC bc that amount of money over the long term doesn’t exist in a way that can be allocated towards making space. 


I would love for USAC to not be attacked for this referendum but students are very quick to assume that everything is the fault of USAC. The man who presented at council tonight (Roy) is a representative from ASUCLA, and the campaign representative (Alexandria) is the chair of ASU. The people at the forefront of this referendum are not members of council."
ucla,fngfife,t1_fngcmjo,1586930629.0,"I must have missed that last sentence when I originally responded. There was a presentation during council tonight on how the money is divided and the CUB social media is posting FAQs as they are approved by election board. To answer your final statement, 25% of every referendum goes back to financial aid so the net impact on students on financial aid is 0. That is a UCOP policy."
ucla,fnge8j4,t1_fngcmjo,1586929551.0,"Every student fee and memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a legal document that cannot be refunded at will. Additionally, to stop the fee from being collected it would require a student vote on each one to be halted /permanently/. That’s the reason why fees such as the Wooden center fee are still in place — because it is legally impossible to stop the fee without a vote to stop it permanently.

As for your other concerns, I don’t want this to turn into the oppression Olympics, but I completely understand what it is like to be underrepresented. The Mother Organization Coalition and the Transfer Leadership Coalition were some of the leaders on making space for underrepresented communities on campus. Those coalitions serve to represent students for whom this university was not created for. Additionally, members of council do come from many different underrepresented communities on campus. This council is majority POC and WOC. We have also been involved with several different cultural organizations on campus and some of us come from spaces of disability, low-income, and other underrepresented groups. We definitely recognize the reality that there is no one-size-fits all solution for minority communities, but the solutions that are in the CUB referendum have been advocated for by many students for decades. Additionally, while council may endorse the referendum, this is not a USAC referendum and the money will NEVER go into USAC control. It will be managed by ASUCLA student board of directors. 

I assume you are referencing the screenshot that circulated on here and while we will truly never know where that message came from, I would advise against trusting something where the person posting it blocked out the names associated that could be used to validate it. When council members became aware of that message, none of us knew where it came from nor who sent it bc we don’t use text message to communicate with our staff. If you reference other leaked screenshots, they have been from GroupMe and the person leaking them have not omitted the relevant names. The message also references an official response which was never a plan and was not materialized so it was also false in that regard."
ucla,fngakn5,t1_fng9c23,1586926555.0,"The post regarding our budget severely misunderstands how our budget works. Millions of dollars are earmarked from certain referendum and so they go to different committees and departments on campus. Those millions are not reflected as spent in the budget even though they have been allocated. As for each office, spring quarter is very very heavy in programming due to culture shows, student run graduations, end of year celebrations, etc. Additionally, some money has already been earmarked for certain purposes but those have yet to be processed and posted. It’s true that offices have a lot of unused funds from this year because of the pandemic, and that is all being put towards a COVID relief fund for students.

SWC (an office of USAC) released theirs on FB today, and during council tonight, many offices pledged remaining office budget towards another fund to assist students. Council members including myself have tried to hold financial aid accountable for the Bruin Tech Grant but bc that is through the university, there is little to nothing that USAC can do. As for the food closet, that is also something that is run through CPO which is another UCLA department that USAC has no authority over. We do give between 2m - 3m a year to CPO but as we have seen in that DB expose, they have refused to be transparent with their funds for many years now.

I want to emphasize that a lot of money is going towards supporting students right now (COVID relief funds, books for Bruins, iclicker and lab coat loans, CRC, SIOC, etc) but underrepresented groups are truly in need of support on campus through creating spaces on campus."

ucla,fng7y7z,t1_fng7epz,1586924555.0,"In the UCLA system of shared governance, neither the academic senate nor admin at Ucla have any authority over USAC (which is why it’s important that everyone votes!) 

I can tell you that council members are paid 10k over 12 months of work. It’s minimum wage for 20 hours a week so I promise I’m not living large out here. Additionally, I can tell you that I personally work way more than 20 hours a week some weeks and will be up until 3 am answering emails and reading documents. 

I’m not sure what you mean by extra funds but anything not used by the end of our fiscal year which ends in July is placed into Surplus for next council. The next council is then tasked with allocating surplus. It is worth noting that per the bylaws, the first 150k of surplus is automatically sent to contingency which is the fund that all student orgs apply to."
ucla,fng718s,t3_g1k19p,1586923887.0,"Hi, throwaway bc work-life balance is important. I’m on USAC and the reason why ppl were removed from the zoom was bc of a gross incident of racial slurs by a non-student in the chat. If you would like to continue viewing, our meetings are streamed through YouTube on USAClive!
In order to regain access to the zoom, you need to use your full name so our advisors can confirm that you are a student bc technically (and this has been enforced in past meetings) our meetings are only public to the UCLA community"
