rapecounseling,fpajy1g,t1_fp7z8i6,1588449720.0,"Yeah, that sounds like the situation to me, especially if it's not the first time it happened.

I was part of the ""burnout group"" in high school and had several female friends who were dating older men. When you're in high school, you don't always realize how shitty and pathetic these guys are. 

You think, maybe you're special if these older men want to date and hang out with you. But looking back, I realize that generally these guys fell into 1 of 2 categories-- either a) they were nice enough men but didn't have the intelligence or maturity to be able to find and keep girlfriends/friends their own age; or b) they were manipulative, abusive men who liked to find high school girls who they could get to do what they want and who would put up with their bullshit because they were too young and inexperienced to know better. 

Either way, they're not quality men and they don't make good partners."
rapecounseling,fp7ojtc,t3_gbscnj,1588374591.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you :( 

Do you really want to be in a relationship with someone who does not take your consent seriously? Who tries to trick you into having sex with him? Who doesn't stop to discuss it more when you say you're unsure of whether or not you want to have sex? Not to mention, someone who is 26 years old trying to date and pressure a high school student into having sex.

I would call what happened rape. It's something you can think more about and unpack as time goes on. Right now I think what's most important is that you think about the questions above and whether you want to be in a relationship with someone like this. Personally, I would run. 

It sounds like you do not want to be in a relationship with him but he is pressuring you to stay. This is a huge red flag. Rape is a huge red flag. I would encourage you to break up with him, perhaps with a friend nearby to drive you away afterwards. Plan what you want to say and stick to that plan."
AskAcademia,fp6fn7p,t3_gbkak3,1588351522.0,"Did they give you a reason why they chose you, and not others? I would also feel singled out and hurt in this situation. I don't think you'll be stigmatized (although I don't know your workplace climate) but I certainly understand the worry and just generally feeling unappreciated. 

Maybe it is something linked to your job duties? E.g., perhaps they're less crucial in the summer? Or perhaps your pay is higher than colleagues?"
AmItheAsshole,foz38ua,t1_foysj1k,1588183939.0,Also just wanted to note that some sports have more prevalence of eating disorders than other sports-- Cheer (or cheerleading) is one of them. It might be better for the daughter to get into other sports or hobbies and expand her friend group.
WTF,fosvwce,t1_fosqifg,1588039140.0,"Just wanted to second what great experiences I've had with the furry community. They are a super welcoming, positive, and forward thinking bunch (especially queer friendly). 

But yeah, like with any con community (or any community, really) there's some shitty people. Honestly though, I've felt more safe and comfortable at furry cons than anime cons."
trashy,fos8c52,t1_fos1wc8,1588025812.0,"Exactly. I love Santa Cruz  (I lived there for 6 years, just moved to Irvine for a job). I love that it's liberal and tolerant. I wish other cities worked to help their homeless instead of dumping them in SC. I'm glad we don't do the same thing, but it's a complicated issue. 

My guess is it's not the homeless trashing the beach though, probably tourists."
datingoverthirty,foe7ymi,t1_foe4bze,1587697867.0,"I know several woman (and men) in this situation. However, they both come from different kinds of social groups. 

The women I know are mostly from work; they're women who are shy, have almost only women friends, in several cases come from religious families, and have very ""romanticized"" ideas of relationships. Their hobbies are usually reading, knitting, and watching netflix. 

The men I know who are like this I mostly met through gaming, they're also shy, have mostly male friends, and also have strange ideas about relationships (sometimes romanticized, but also sometimes ""sexualized""). Their hobbies are often video games. 

So I think it definitely exists for both genders. Also, not everyone falls into these stereotyped categories; I also know 2 men and 1 woman who are still virgins in their late 20s-early 30s who have managed to come out of their shells but still haven't had any relationships."
UCI,fodonjm,t1_fodhwh9,1587687266.0,"Yeah I am lucky to have it, I bought it recently and it would make it that much harder if I had to bus around now like I used to. I try to go on a walk every day and hiking every weekend, it's important to get outside even if it's solo.

Another thing I've been doing a lot is Tabletop Simulator on Steam; you can play almost any boardgame on there and it's been a nice way of connecting with friends (or even just random people)."
UCI,fock293,t3_g6rl93,1587672253.0,"I'm sorry :( I know what you mean, yesterday I drove to pick up groceries and I cried seeing the road signs for places I used to go and have fun. I miss my girlfriend, my friends, and having freedom of movement. The job market is so bad I worry a lot about my future.

It's hard to concentrate on work some days. What has helped me is just acknowledging that this situation sucks, and trying to take it one day at  a time. When I start to think about how long it might last I feel overwhelmed and depressed. One day at a time."
FemmeLesbians,fo91uby,t3_g6efcm,1587608643.0,"Online dating. Honestly, I think even for non-femmes, it's the easiest way to meet other queer women. Another option is groups meant specifically for queer women (e.g., meetup lesbian groups). You could also try queer women nights at bars (if there are any in your area).

At least in large, liberal cities, there's so many people wearing pride stuff that it's not an effective way of signaling."
rapecounseling,fo8rd61,t1_fo8jfgt,1587602261.0,"Good question. I still feel a little mixed about it, but overall am glad I know. 

For awhile, a big part of me wished he'd never told me because I felt it was just one more thing added to the list of abuses I'd gone through and I wasn't sure how (or if) to unpack it. After I heard, I felt shocked. Part of me even wondered if he was lying. He didn't tell me in a way that was careful or considerate, and I felt angry and confused-- especially since I didn't remember anything.

But now it's been over 10 years since he told me, and I'm grateful for the knowledge. I still don't have any memory of it, but some people do suddenly remember things from their childhood, so I think it's good to have that information. I'm glad to have a more complete picture of my childhood, even if it's dark. 

I imagine there's some things that are better to be kept secret/private (hence the AA exception), but I think overall family secrets cause more harm when they're kept secret."
rapecounseling,fo4zhfl,t3_g5os4c,1587514303.0,"It' sounds like you've come a long way in just 3 years! Out of an abusive relationship and into therapy, and out of having lots of people pleasing sex to having sex with a loving partner. That's amazing!! You should be really proud.

Healing is a long journey. Frankly, you may never ""move on"" completely. You have the right to be angry and it makes sense that you'd struggle to connect to people. 

I think I started to feel better when I accepted the fact that I was never ""not going to be sad"" about my childhood abuse, or about how my brother molested my sister and I wasn't able to protect her. It will always be there, with me. It's a part of me and to an extent why I am who I am. Of course it will continue to make me sad and angry sometimes. It would be weird if it didn't. They were horrible and unfair experiences. 

It sounds like you're taking the right steps towards healing.  I would just be patient and accepting of yourself. Therapy has helped me a lot, but so has media-- some of the shows that have a trauma focus I've enjoyed are Mr. Robot, Russian Doll, West World, and BoJack Horseman. I also recommend the book ""Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving"" by Pete Walker. Cheers to surviving :)"
rapecounseling,fo3nin7,t1_fo3kpca,1587489865.0,"Yeah, that doesn't sound great. Sometimes people can be black out drunk, unaware of what's happening, and still able to walk around, talk, etc. In a situation like this, you would hope that a sober person would realize the other person isn't sober enough to consent to sex. If this has been destroying you over the past few years, I'd definitely seek out a therapist to talk to about it. Also, if you're still in contact with this person, you might consider cutting off or limiting contact. I've found that's helped me heal."
FemmeLesbians,fo3lmre,t3_g5fkgz,1587488971.0,"This is totally normal-- I've walked into plenty of dates and within the first 5 minutes realized there is no chemistry, even after days/weeks of promising text conversations. I wish I knew why this happened, or how I can magically tell so fast that there is no chemistry. But somehow, I just know. 

So I don't think you jumped the gun too quickly, it's just the way it is. Trust your body and your gut. 

Kind of funny aside, but I also met the woman I'm currently dating (another femme) through online dating. Our text conversation was lack luster and she was so shy she barely talked on our first date. By many standards it was probably not a ""good first date"". But, the chemistry was there, and we're still dating almost a year later. 

It's part of what makes dating so hard, it's difficult to quantify why we're attracted to some people and not others. But if you know, you know-- good that you let her down easy and early, don't feel guilty! :-)"
rapecounseling,fo3gbfb,t3_g5hmpj,1587486418.0,"You might explore this with a therapist. What was it that bothered you about the incident? 

I'm a woman who has had sex with sober (or mostly sober) people when I was really drunk that I initiated, and I didn't think of the experiences as rape. However, sex that starts consensual can turn into rape (e.g., he takes the condom off, does anal, etc without consent). Also, sex might be a regretful experience (e.g., in the morning, you wish you had not had sex with this person, you can't believe you did that, etc). The latter isn't rape, but it's still an unpleasant experience that you might wish to talk to someone about.  That's perfectly valid-- it doesn't have to be sexual assault to be a bad or confusing experience that you want to talk out with a professional."
raisedbynarcissists,fo3f7bx,t1_fo1ulvg,1587485874.0,"Same... my therapist helped me realize that they will never acknowledge or apologize for shitty things they've said and done, they'll just gaslight me and make me feel worse. I've stopped trying to bring things up."
rapecounseling,fo15agi,t3_g52lqr,1587426038.0,"Based on your memories, it sounds likely that you were sexually assaulted.  I think these kinds of memories are really hard, and it's a personal decision where to go with them. I was in foster care for a bit as a child, and when I was around 20, my dad told me how I had been molested there when I was around 5. I do have some very blurry memories of being touched on a playground that I assume are from that.

I have spoken a little about it to therapists over the years, but ultimately I've decided not to unpack the sexual abuse memories. They are so blurry I questioned whether I could really get anything out of them. Trying to remember them gave me anxiety, as I wasn't sure what was real and what wasn't. I have the benefit of at least having an account of what my dad says he remembers the social worker saying, but even he didn't remember much.

So for me, I felt that trying to explore it on such limited information wasn't very helpful.  Other people I know have felt differently and have explored childhood sexual abuse/assault with a therapist, even when their memories are limited. It's possible to talk about how the experience might have affected you and your sexuality today, for example. I think it's ultimately a personal decision. If it bothers you often, I would talk to someone about it."
raisedbynarcissists,fo0p4hy,t1_fnzatck,1587417167.0,"Yup, my parents were so excited to share all over facebook when I got my PhD, saying how they knew I could do it. Never mind that they had tried to discourage me at every level, from taking college bound courses in high school, to applying to college, to my PhD. Convenient how they forget all of that once I succeed despite them."
AmItheAsshole,fnqa3fb,t1_fnp3zzz,1587160610.0,"Exactly, it's very normal to be putting on weight at this age. If I look at pictures of when I was 12-13, I look chubby because I was putting on weight for a growth spurt. I have never been overweight. 

If OP is concerned, she and her husband should be mindful to keep healthy foods at home and cook healthy meals. They should model healthy eating, exercise, and a healthy attitude about weight (which includes not doing fad diets or being obsessive about weighing yourself). 

It's common for unhealthy weight attitudes and behaviors to pass from moms to their daughters. Try to break that cycle."
AmItheAsshole,fnn584n,t3_g2fg75,1587084676.0,"NTA. I don't understand in general why people feel the need to share their kinks with others, but this one in particular is an odd one to share with you. It's especially bad that she kept sharing even after you told her to stop. I wonder what motivated her to share."
AskWomen,fnfzvqt,t1_fnflyin,1586919083.0,"That's so shitty, I'm sorry that happened to you :( I hope you went forward and tried another therapist. I had a therapist also tell me that my childhood sexual abuse ""didn't sound that bad"" because it was perpetrated by an older child rather than adult... talk about invalidating. Luckily, I had had good experiences with therapists prior to this, so I moved forward and tried someone else. But if that was my first therapy experience, I'm not sure I would bother trying another person.

I really can't understand their reasoning... like, they're a therapist. They're trained specifically for this. Sure, there will always be people who dealt with worse situations, but child abuse is pretty serious, and they're supposed to be there for us. Plus, a major fear of mine was that people wouldn't believe me or take it seriously, so having a therapist act like that was distressing.  

In the first few meetings, he also invalidated my bisexuality and talked about himself all the time. Both red flags that should have resulted in me discontinuing therapy with him, but the abuse invalidation was enough for me to stop seeing him. Thankfully the next therapist I tried was great."
AskWomen,fnf4pid,t1_fnekbv1,1586901359.0,"I also went for years for childhood abuse, and I agree that from session to session I barely saw any change--- but after 3 years there had been huge, long lasting changes. Finding a good therapist is especially important for severe childhood trauma. I went through several therapists who seemed uncomfortable with it. I still go back and do short term therapy from time to time just to check in, but every time I dread having to find a new person."
AskAcademia,fnbc4vq,t3_g0j55w,1586812915.0,"For the most part, I really enjoyed my PhD experience. HOWEVER it was also exhausting and nerve wracking. It's also a period where you're not making much money and are ""still a student"". For these reasons, I do think your friends and family are right: it's better to do it earlier rather than later. 

I was 25 when I started and that felt right. I knew people in their 30's and 40's with families trying to get a PhD, and to be honest it seemed a little short sighted that they were trying to take care and provide for their families while being a student. It's doable but PhD stipends aren't really meant to provide for a family of 4."
