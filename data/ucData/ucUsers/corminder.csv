I'm never on top of this stuff and just kind of assumed that if I filed for 2020-21 FAFSA that it would include summer. Am I screwed? What can I do? Help!"
ucla,fpmu6fk,t3_gbtfy6,1588741827.0,Oh shoot. We were supposed to file for summer financial aid? Nooooo. Why did I just assume I would get it if I filed for 2020-2021? Is there anything I can do?

whatsthisplant,fox3umg,t3_g9v0yl,1588133431.0,"The title of this post seems so frantic. ""I need it bad for my collection"" like it's a drug. Totally relatable. I feel I need it now as well."
Vivarium,fnyjyys,t1_fny5zlo,1587365446.0,That's awesome! I've never heard of that. I've been looking into making vivarium background but a lot of the methods seems super complicated. I like this idea. Hope it goes well for your plants!
funny,fnxuvjl,t1_fnxfp9k,1587346830.0,Goddamn I feel this in my bones and have never put it into words. Yes. Yes.
AskLosAngeles,fnxumyo,t1_fnwz3l7,1587346687.0,"Is that really more than enough? I'm on the westside as well and can't for the life of me find a studio/ 1BR that is less than $1,600. And even those are pretty janky... I was hoping not to push $1,300 and I think that at this point I may just have to move in with a friend."

plantclinic,fnm2blf,t3_g2cv97,1587063863.0,"Watering every other day seems like too much. I mean, it is a big plant and a smaller pot so if it's really drying out that quickly then that schedule should be fine. But otherwise, don't water if the soil is wet. I usually let my begonias completely dry out (like bone dry full through) before I water them. They don't seem to mind the abuse, haha!"
plantclinic,fnm1ozx,t1_fni41jk,1587063545.0,"I definitely have a bulb on the ZZ, even in the soil now if I water too heavy or move the soil slightly I can see it there. Nothing coming out of it. Now that Winter has past I'll have to ramp up the fertilization!"
toys,fng8mto,t3_g1bod0,1586925067.0,"Damn, I used to love the Schleich toys as a kid... I see them in stores sometimes now and I'm like they're so cool! How often do you acquire yours?"
plantclinic,fn4rm3z,t1_fn183yq,1586647465.0,"True about the Winter thing! I didn't know that about the ZZs. Hopefully now that it's getting warmer and more light, i'll see some growth. Thank you!"
techsupport,fn4rk0e,t1_fn2m0dx,1586647430.0,"Okay, I'll try to do that more often. It just seems silly for something that so many people now use to not have autocorrect. Imagine if our phones didn't have autocorrect haha!"
plantclinic,fn4rgox,t1_fn2328v,1586647374.0,Oooh yeah intitially in the water it took forever to show roots. Like months before I saw anything but the green stem
plantclinic,fn1748v,t1_fn0gmkw,1586556106.0,"I didn't know this either. I had a ZZ plant cutting that rooted beautifully in water and sat there for months and months (probably 6+, even a year idk). I transplanted him into soil and he's still just a green stalk sitting in soil. No new growth or nodes from the bottom or anything. And he's been in this pot now probably since around Thanksgiving or so. I wonder every single day I walk into the kitchen if he's ever going to become something more! Is there anything I can do to boost for new growth? I recently watered with a water soluble all-purpose houseplant fertilizer."
ucla,fmymex0,t1_fmylb1u,1586489744.0,"Sorry, I'm totally confused by everything right now haha. Okay, so just to be totally clear: I have until Week 10 to decide if I want to completely drop a course without ANY repercussions? 

Also, I'm seeing on the calendar that June 5th is the last day to drop non-impacted classes. Do you know what this means: ""Last day to [**drop nonimpacted classes**](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Forms/Registration-and-Enrollment/Enrollment-Petition)(Letters and Science undergraduates) by petition with instructor approval, per-class fee, and transcript notation""? Like if I decide I want to drop a class in Week 6, can I just click drop and that's it? Or does this mean I still have to file a petition with the instructor? I don't even know how that works. 

Anyways, sorry for the rant. My brain hurts trying to figure out the logistics of all of this and I'm stressin' in one of my classes ahh. Any help is greatly appreciated!

ucla,fmyl7ol,t3_frg7hg,1586488874.0,I was told that it's extended to Week 10. But I can't verify... I'm confused now and stressing because tomorrow is the normal drop deadline. Did you get any more insight on this?
ucla,fmyl3bg,t3_fukitv,1586488786.0,Did you figure this out at all? Someone told me drop deadlines are extended to Week 10 for both impacted and non-impacted courses. Do you know if this is true?
ucla,fmykzn2,t3_fu83n7,1586488714.0,Do you know if we have until Week 10 to decide whether we want to drop?

frogs,fmj0pfz,t1_fmhplkd,1586120694.0,"Yeah that’s what I’m hoping as well. I feel so much guilt; I went back to the spot this morning (which sounds stupid) just to see if maybe he was still clinging to the tree because he looked a bit skinny and didn’t move after I put him there. Didn’t find him. Thanks for your help though. Wish I coulda kept him as a quarantine buddy. I was so prepared to set up a whole terrarium and everything, which is why I went to the pet store. Ahg."
