premed,fpn1uxb,t3_gee1vf,1588747698.0,"I love that you added your age at the end. I feel like a lot of the stress from my premed peers comes from this rigorous schedule that they have because everybody wants to get in straight out of undergrad so they end up juggling STEM classes, ec's, sometimes jobs. I'm 24, I'll be 25 when I graduate, and then I'll take a gap year. I'll probably get in by my late 20's, although I hope to be admitted right after my gap year since I really need to work on my volunteering, and I'm fine with that. Life's been an amazing journey for me and I've learned and experienced so many things since  I first started community college at 19 with premed in mind. This is really about the journey because the studying for hours on end will only get worse once you're in medical school, but the people you meet and the activities you participate in along the way are what make it memorable. 

Good luck to everyone! And don't stress it too much, life's more than a ticking clock."
NoStupidQuestions,fpmt45c,t3_ged81j,1588741010.0,"Depends on how long you starve the person and how much they have of each. A really buff person (think buff person) doesn't even need to go into starvation to start losing muscle mass if they don't keep up their protein intake. At the same time, an obese person will lose fat even if they just go down to a 2k calorie diet because they can no longer maintain all that fat. Typically for a regular person you'd expect fat to be lost first. 

Also, that guy that's saying you lose both at the same time is using wikipedia as a source, which is not a valid source for anything, and I'm not sure how he concluded what he said because when I read the page it clearly says that fat is lost first."
fantasywriters,fpmcyvk,t3_geapoy,1588730378.0,"I guess it depends on what you want to do with this. If you want to publish, then you will find that most people on here say to stay clear of info dumping at the beginning of your story and to instead start with a good hook sentence. Any information that will be useful to the story should be revealed over the course of the story, as needed. What's the use of dumping the creation story if it never ties into anything else that happens later in the book? Even if it does, info dumping this early on in the book might put a lot of readers off because they aren't yet invested enough in your work to want to sit through that.

If you're just writing for fun, then do whatever you feel you like best. Although I would still recommend trying to find a good hook sentence and trying to not have to do info dumps because it will strengthen your writing abilities to be able to slowly reveal critical details and be able to foreshadow.

That said, you can use the prophet as a vehicle to show off your creation story, but have these questions in mind: Who is this prophet talking to? Is it the MC, is it a peer, and why is this conversation important? Why does this conversation need the creation story to be told in order to advance the plot? Why does the other character not know this story? Again, going back to what I said previously, see if this information is necessary to your plot. I have no problem with it taking place later on in the story if you have a curious MC that asks a prophet, but I personally think that it's too early in the story to world build at that scale."
NoStupidQuestions,fpmbql7,t3_gean4h,1588729642.0,"I disagree with your premise, I don't think we have the whole written knowledge of the humankind on the tip of our fingers. A lot of our knowledge isn't freely floating around on google, it's hidden behind paywalls and things like that. 

Those willing to spend money may have better chances of reaching a reliable source because people that are charging for the information that they give don't usually do it dishonestly, especially if that information is found in the form of peer-reviewed articles. Also, websites ending in .com, which are the vast majority of sites, exist off of the money they make from the ads they have. Their incentive isn't to provide truthful information, it's just to get traffic so that they can get payed.

I don't think the future is bleak at all and I don't fully understand some of the people that use that as their reason. Sure, there are wars, diseases, poverty, and a lot of other crap that make human life imperfect/hard. But the way I see it, that's been true throughout history. If I was homeless or lived in a war-torn country, then I would understand that viewpoint, because things would hit close to home and if I had a kid then he/she would only suffer with me. But, I live in a city, go to school, and am fully capable of working and have worked in the past. I'm not rich, but neither are my parents or sister and their lives have been fine (I'd say more than fine, but I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth). My life has been fine. We have gone through some things here and there, but that's life. Life is really beautiful imo, and sharing it with someone for whom I am fully responsible would only make it more so. I see it as, ""okay, I've had my turn. Now it's yours.""

Also, a part of me wants to just say that life is meant to reproduce, sexually or asexually. The onus isn't on me to say why I should, the onus is on you to say why you shouldn't. Everyone's case is different but I don't yet see a reason to not have a kid myself."

fantasywriters,fowzigq,t3_ga1lij,1588130545.0,"Well, a lot of the magic stuff has already been done to death, so I don't think you should feel bad about your magic system. Your story seems pretty interesting to me, I'd say go for it. At the end of the day you should ask yourself what part magic plays in your story. Is it super important, or is it just in the background? At the end of the day, the reader is reading the story of your MC, not your magic system. If you have great characters along with a really interesting story, I don't really see why I would put it down just because it's another story with elemental magic. 

That said, in what I'm writing, I have elemental magic as well, but it's only one of 5 branches of magic that are available. And even then, it's subdivided into common elemental (fire, water, earth, air) and mythical elemental (ice, lava, lightning, shadow), which is way more rare."
berkeley,fosu2go,t1_fosqmqm,1588038058.0,"As a new transfer you will find that it takes a while for your calcentral to accurately reflect what lower divs you have taken.

There are just too many new students to have processed by the time semester starts). 

You are correct, those are completed at cc."
berkeley,fosoru5,t1_fosmkz3,1588034952.0,"I had your exact question when I transferred in. Basically, you can take more than 8 upper divs, so you can take 3 per semester if you want, although I wouldn't recommend 4 because that can be difficult if you're STEM. 8 is just the minimum. However, that only covers your college's requirement (mine is letters & science), you  still need 120 units overall to graduate Berkeley. To reach the 120 minimum needed, you can do any mix of upper divs or lower divs from either inside or outside your college (this is where you have the freedom to take courses that you think sound interesting to you). You also have to be careful that you finish on time because you are allowed to take any number of units up to your second fall semester, but after that you can't take any more if you surpassed 120. If that happens, then you're put on probation or something (not too familiar with what happens here, but you can look it up. Basically, I think they don't let you take classes at Cal anymore and you have to take them outside.). This is only an issue if you end up dropping one of your required courses and fail to retake it within your 2 allotted academic years while also maxing out your 120 units.

Finally, just to clarify, you need a minimum of 120 units to graduate, regardless of college. And you can take as many as you want above 120, as long as it is within your 4 allotted semesters after transferring in. If you choose to stay longer, don't exceed 120."
berkeley,fordlva,t3_g95hmi,1588010427.0,"I think the consensus right now is either do all P/NP or all graded.

I am taking my classes for the letter grade since COVID hasn't really affected me, other than making me lazier, but I can manage. And while schools say they'll understand if you P/NP this semester, I don't buy it tbh. But that's just my opinion.

I also love DBZ, but that story's lore is non-existent imo. Pretty much everything you need to know happens on-screen and is mentioned only in passing because Akira was making things up as he went along. DBZ is a very linear, basic story: Bad guy shows up, beats everyone, everyone trains, everyone still can't win, Goku wins, repeat. With the exception of Cell, where Gohan won. Also, DBZ characters that aren't saiyans get phased out as the story progresses, making everybody except Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, and Trunks useless by the time the story ends. And even then, it's Goku that makes the difference. I think DB was better in terms of cast of characters because the power levels were similar.

Fantasy,fmnsvlt,t3_fw3k80,1586234341.0,"I really like how in Runescape there was a particular character, Lucien, that tried to ascend by stealing and using the power of 2 instruments left behind by the Elder Gods, which are primordial and stronger than regular Gods. During the climax of his storyline, he seems to believe that he has become a god as he addresses himself as such during the battle at the Mahjarrat Ritual Site, but is ultimately killed. 

Later it turns out that in order to ascend you actually need to transfer the energy of a God to yourself by using certain instruments left behind by the Elder Gods, so Lucien was only half way done during his failed attempt. In fact, he was inspired by another of his kind that ascended using those same 2 instruments, but it was much later revealed that it only worked for that other guy because he siphoned the God energy of a God during a confrontation. So Lucien never had a chance because there were no active Gods on Runescape at the time. 

I still find this to be a fascinating implementation of ascension: obtain powerful artifacts from the Elder Gods in order to rival the power of mortal Gods, then find a God and transfer its energy unto yourself, which means you're likely going to have to fight a God. Basically, the character has to be super lucky in order to come upon these powerful instruments, then strong enough to take them and keep them, since many factions are after them, and THEN needs to have the guts to confront a God and not die in the process."
