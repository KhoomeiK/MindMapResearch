berkeley,fp9swmg,t3_gc3jba,1588433877.0,"CS and MCB are both pretty rigorous. In CS, you will have projects that consume a ton of time and some crazy professors while in mcb you will be graded with some of the harshest grading distributions on campus... that being said, I know a lot of people who are either mcb/cs OR mcb/data science. Both are pretty solid combos but the latter certainly leans itself to a greater overlap in major requirements."
berkeley,fp8t3hp,t3_gc1qap,1588402084.0,Take a break occasionally. Sometimes you just need to give your brain a half hour or hour to just chill and recuperate.
ucla,fp73m6x,t1_fp6zx29,1588363434.0,No. He's too kind of a professor to do something like that. His exams are hard but he is \*generally\* a pretty reasonable guy (at least from my office hours interactions with him a year or two ago).
ucla,fp6znib,t1_fp50aig,1588361401.0,Berkeley student here: I definitely don't think this is a Berkeley chem prof lol. I think this came from Rutgers. There was controversy with an ochem class here and ppl uploading an exam to chegg but that class always sports sub 50% averages on midterms Lol.
berkeley,fp54vl5,t3_gbd9st,1588316378.0,i've heard theater 118ac is pretty interesting and not particularly rigorous in terms of grading.
berkeley,fp10dot,t1_fp0u6x1,1588221135.0,"Key word: usually

edit: grammar lol"
berkeley,fozratx,t3_gaeweo,1588195495.0,It usually gets a bit better in upper div.
berkeley,fozjls1,t1_fozbjdg,1588191757.0,I suppose this was a rare facet through which other perspectives were explored haha.
berkeley,fozjhm8,t3_gagj7b,1588191701.0,both are more or less equivalent. Psych 2 is supposed to be less intensive than Psych 1 but both of them aren't particularly rigorous imo (I took Psych 1).
berkeley,foyi2dr,t3_ga7oqc,1588172907.0,Some of my international friends in freshman year who didn't want to go home for the break chose to stay in airbnb's nearby or at a friend's apartment.
berkeley,foyccoq,t1_fownedk,1588169904.0,Do you see on-campus research facilities (particularly in the natural and physical sciences) reopening in the fall?
berkeley,fowl1ma,t3_g9yldp,1588121873.0,You can email them but I doubt they will make final conflict accommodations. I've taken very few courses that have made such accommodations.
berkeley,forlkf8,t3_g95ywt,1588014277.0,"I did something similar. Idk how Chem 3A will work online in the fall, but I do think it's doable."
berkeley,foqplap,t3_g8wig0,1587998479.0,"I did not take Chem 3AL with this instructor, but in my experience the chem labs for bio lower divs usually grade on a typical high school scale, so I would assume that a 93+ is certainly an A."
berkeley,foopsrk,t1_foop4p3,1587943904.0,ah is this a luxury living place or something? My 2b1b last year on southside was a little over half of that total.
berkeley,fooooj1,t3_g8mw9h,1587943234.0,4.8k a month total???? damn.
berkeley,flznuy3,t1_flzk39p,1585628400.0,"would you recommend Gu? Or would Nadler be a safer bet? Gu has a way more lenient distribution on berkeleytime, but I'm wondering if taking it with Nadler would make for a more productive learning experience. Thanks!"
