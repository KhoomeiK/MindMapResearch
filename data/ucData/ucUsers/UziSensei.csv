berkeley,fpehevz,t3_gd06c3,1588547605.0,"In my humble opinion, I absolutely can't stand him. I've had him for the past 3 semesters (70, 170, 188) and I've had to teach myself the material (using the notes and shit). His lectures are the worst i've had during my 4 years here.  The good thing is that he is nice in OH and the exams aren't all too bad. This is just my opinion though, there are a few people I know who enjoyed his classes."

berkeley,fohbzuu,t3_g7gxg1,1587763428.0,Jesus fucking christ NOBODY KNOWS!!! Stop asking these questions! Just wait for an official announcement
berkeley,focre4h,t3_g6tvji,1587674836.0,You should probably just take the MIT course. 61a is not worth the money
berkeley,fo5eurj,t3_g5t3ov,1587523954.0,[https://sp19.datastructur.es/](https://sp19.datastructur.es/) I was able to access it
berkeley,fo1yxjx,t3_g58thm,1587444934.0,Definitely not. It’s pretty low workload  and really interesting topics
berkeley,fntdh6b,t1_fntcvec,1587239461.0,"They don't suck, but they're not really consistent throughout. They get our hopes up only to disappoint. This has been the case for the past 4 years (I'm a senior lol)."
berkeley,fntcnte,t1_fntbqcv,1587239000.0,Wack in the sense that they tend to disappoint every season. They start out strong then go downhill from there.
berkeley,fnt9vgs,t3_g3swzg,1587237429.0,"School spirit is ok. Football isn't a big deal here, considering the fact that our team is pretty wack. Majority of people just focus on academics, which is pretty much the entirety of our school pride."

berkeley,fnnmhjv,t1_fnnayo8,1587095895.0,I felt like I had a lot of fun with learning the concepts and working through the projects. His lectures are great. The final project was pretty open ended (making a pacman-like game) and was a lot of fun.
berkeley,fnn6gzj,t3_g2rjsm,1587085450.0,"Data 8 over the summer sounds pretty chill, so you could actually enjoy your summer at the same time. 61b over the summer sounds like it sucks. I personally took 61b with Hug and it was an awesome experience. He’s definitely my favorite professor here at Cal"
berkeley,fnlx8jz,t3_g2k5pl,1587061317.0,"If you’re doing AI/ML grad school, it’s probably a good idea to take an AI class right?  188 is a fun class."
berkeley,fnlt4vl,t3_g2jmjl,1587059275.0,"My man, nobody here knows the answer to this. There have been many posts asking the same thing and people only speculate. Just wait for an official announcement."
berkeley,fncz6sd,t1_fncyh93,1586852463.0,"Sure, but it might be a little more work as the class expects you to know how to use Data 100 stuff like Pandas, scikit learn, etc. There is a brief review, but its minimal. Data 100 is a ""recommended prereq"", so you would be able to get by."
berkeley,fncmrtr,t3_g0z4kv,1586840829.0,"I took it last Fall and the workload was fairly low. The class is similar to Data 100, maybe even easier. There are weekly ""Projects"" which are more like homeworks tbh. The midterm was very easy and there is no final, just a final project. If you've taken Data 100, the class should be pretty chill"

berkeley,fmu1pu1,t3_fxe3mc,1586382939.0,Ugba 135 (Personal Finance) is pretty useful and easy
berkeley,fm9mbw9,t3_ftt2vm,1585871698.0,Maybe check out a supermarket or a pharmacy. They’re probably in high demand rn
