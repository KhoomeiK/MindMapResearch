Warhammer40k,fpln35f,t3_ge6zxj,1588715709.0,As a general note I'm going for a super quick paint scheme trying to make the best use of washes and just some quick choice highlights since I have to paint many of these

Warhammer40k,fp3a0ap,t1_fp2x7fm,1588275684.0,They've kinda had a resurgence in sales though. And with them simplifying the rules with AOS and 8E there's likely a market for more crunchy specialist games again

science,focicrk,t3_g6fyml,1587671668.0,To some degree I always saw this effect as some sort of catharsis stemming from the villain representing the evil resentful part of ourselves and by engaging in a story about the destruction of the expatriated villainous thoughts is cleansing.

Northwestern,fo8urvu,t3_g5qn39,1587604272.0,"ISP student who graduated 2017 here, hopefully I can answer some of your questions.

7. In general I'd say the teaching for ISP courses is much more intimate since the classes are usually all sub 20 people. This is usually good and sometimes not. Some of the classes are better than others but the program does heavily encourage you to study with your classmates which makes most classes manageable even if the professors aren't the best teachers. 

8. Again it depends on you, it's very easy for your friend group freshman year to be very ISP heavy but depending on if you Rush/join clubs/ participate in anything outside of campus you'll definitely be meeting people from anywhere. 

9. For me it was since you're surrounded by people in labs, but again find a lab you're interested in and you shouldn't have much trouble, the undergrad size compared to the grad schools size means that if you want a lab position you can pretty much guarantee you'll have it. 

10. for me the ISP house was a lifesaver, I lived in a fraternity house for 2 years and off campus for senior year and it's a fantastic spot if you need to just pack up a bunch of snacks and pull an all nighter to study. 

11. It's been a while but ISP is much more course heavy than other majors but most people get a second major and since there's so much overlap between other stem majors it's often like 5-6 additional classes for the double major. 

Generally I'd say much of the purpose behind ISP wasn't clear to me until I was in grad school. It gives you the capability to sit in a room with someone from basically any STEM field and be able to super quickly understand what they're doing. Even if you're just interested in one science, the ability to quickly relate and abstract your findings from one field into the broader community is incredibly useful for grant-writing/applications development. ISP is probably the most intense freshman year, and I certainly struggled with it at first, but it's certainly worth it in the long run"

UCSD,fo8rt98,t3_g5wi2m,1587602519.0,They aren't fixed term leases. You have 2 years of housing but you can cancel in the middle with 30 days notice
UCSD,fo8r8dr,t3_g59xba,1587602185.0,"Social distancing is likely going to continue into the fall and I don't appreciate your irreverent tone with regard to the survival rate of the UCSD community. Social distancing is in fact making UCSD a little less dead, additionally I believe that student may be interacting social more frequently over zoom than they ever did while present on campus. If you need the experience of an ideal dance planned in the price center ballroom I suggest you grab yourself a nice non-alcoholic beverage and watch the heartfelt conclusion of Napoleon Dynamite as the experience should be similar."

PrintedMinis,fncf9xa,t1_fnc8yfg,1586835338.0,I'm putting it on a venerable dread just for a shelf piece so kinda basic box design works well for me cause i'm not into too much chaos flare but some people might like that sort of thing
PrintedMinis,fnc7u5d,t1_fn7k9l2,1586830485.0,So the arm holes at 4.5 mm in diameter. this might be a little tight when printed but they could be easily drilled out if needed. the rivets are like .5 mm compared to .75 mm trim on the standard dread but I don't have anything to measure it that precisely. I can't imagine they're too standard across the normal GW prints. also holy crap that was way fast
Warhammer40k,fnauk6y,t1_fnaj778,1586804078.0,The Tau are not so subtlety based off of china and their social philosophies. If you want to argue if China is a true communist country than that's a more academic discussion than a forum about space demons and spaceships that run on orks shouts

Warhammer40k,fnaalyc,t1_fna8c2f,1586794105.0,Technically both are true but neither matters. It's kinda the point of good sci do to discuss what could happen to the world

PrintedMinis,fn78rrw,t1_fn68zga,1586715508.0,Maybe 1.5 inches tall x 1.5 wide and .6 deep. I don't really know what would look good on the back of them (maybe radiator find?) but if you could get some of those rivets and trim along the outer sides of the arms I think that would make it fit in with the sculpt
40kLore,fn5rt5x,t1_fn39jfq,1586673707.0,Honestly the part where it talks about it's master who it deeply respected getting tortured destroys me. It's such an interesting contrast watching a star trek type character thrown into this dystopia
PrintedMinis,fn5psyl,t1_fn44gex,1586671842.0,Okay very heavily considering this. Dunno how good of speakers I can fit in this tho
PrintedMinis,fn5p519,t1_fn3ag5r,1586671242.0,I'm thinking starting from the missile launcher type arm and maybe just extending it outward a little further. For the back I'm thinking radiator type fins but I'm unsure how it would work with printing
