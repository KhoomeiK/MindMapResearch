RedPillWomen,fpenswr,t3_gcwhgk,1588551148.0,"Liz Lisa, Ank Rouge, Axes Femme, Penderie. They're all japanese brands but I find them second hand on depop, poshmark or ebay(mostly depop). A lot of the items I've found still have their tags on too!.

Many of their pieces are just wonderful, such as cardigans, sweaters, coats (I found a super femenine coat for $60 recently), shoes, and tops."
femalefashionadvice,fox4k5q,t1_fowqnbj,1588133910.0,"I've actually been buying second hand items :) I use depop and poshmark and most of the stuff still have their tag on for more than half off the original price. 

For ruffle skirts, I have a lot of luck looking for that in poshmark (Hollister ruffle skirts for example). I suggest you ""heart"" the items and wait a bit to get a discount most of the users throw at you to get you to buy lol.

Then on depop I find cute cardigans. Keywords like: Liz lisa, ank rouge, axes femme or just color of your choice and ""cardigan"". Some are stupid expensive but if you keep looking, you'll find that gem."

Nothing too sexy. Just fresh, non-overpowering, long lasting, appropiate for day wear.

I heard the Chanel Mademoiselle was a good choice but I'd really like some opinions!."

I got it in dusty pink: https://imgur.com/a/VfOxb4I

He was with my sister in her room and it seems like he had a very very hard fight last night. This process was absolutely not kind to him but at least its over now.

I really hope he's happy wherever he is now ‚ù§Ô∏è"

You will be through this. I hope your little one ends up being okay but if not, I hope you know your dog had a fulfilling life with you and your family. I'm sure they're very well loved."

I don't mind places that cater more to smaller builds (be it petite/shorter/ different body structure) because most clothing stores have awful sizing anyway. 

If theres clothing stores exclusively for plus sized people, there should be stores for smaller sizes as well."

I've been having massive pain on a tooth that most likely needs a root canal since early march. Dentist wanted to try adjusting the bite first but a few weeks later its gotten worse.

Now who know's when I'll get to fix this tooth but I'm hoping my face doesn't explode yet, not until I finish this last semester of college lol.

I miss you dentists :(( Ya'll do amazing work and I'd bake you a cake if you could just fix this tooth for me haha."

AskReddit,fmumnf8,t3_fxhsdo,1586394406.0,"MLMs; Shakeology, Monat, Farmasi, etc. So many of my early 20's aquantances are buying into this pay to play ""business""  calling themselves ""business owners"" and barking about how much money they're making. Whats interesting is the fact that you can clearly find recent income statements that pretty much state only 1-2% actually make good money. 96-99% them either lose money or make no money. 

I'm more sad than anything. These are lovely young women who can do so much better. One of them even dropped out of nursing school because she poped put a few kids and pursued one of those MLM's. Like, you make way less than minimum wage in these companies.

Anyway, people fall for these all the time. If you have to pay a fee to have a ""job"", its a scam."
