You’re a student worker in athletics, which somehow is more essential than foodservice, so you’re getting paid. Then you’re asking to get voted in to ASUCR, which is another place student fees go, in part to pay ASUCR stipends."

Stop taking them seriously. Regard them as the joke they are."
ucr,fn3u9y2,t3_fywfx5,1586628034.0,"As another person posted, refer to [assist.org](https://assist.org) or ask your advisor. Some classes do transfer, others don't. It depends on your program, and the CC in question. For example -- in my program *no math class below Calculus I will transfer over.* 

Also keep in mind that most CCs are on the semester program. This affects how courses get counted. At RCC, engineering physics is a four-course series (PHY4A-D) but at UCR the same series is five courses (PHY40A-E). Same with single-variable calculus, which is two courses at a CC but three at UCR.

Bear in mind that many lower division courses are *actually harder* at a CC than at a UC. I know this is absolutely true for english, physics, and calculus"
ucr,fmr0tmr,t3_fvvgu7,1586311278.0,"I’m a pretty loud critic of ASUCR and even I’m siding with the elections director here. If you want to talk to ASUCR about student fees the appropriate conduit is your ASUCR senator. I’ve interacted directly with elections directors in past years, but my interactions were always directly pertaining to the secure conduct of elections and were mediated by my senator (I’m a cybersecurity researcher). This sort of advocacy is actually out of the elections directors purview."

I’m looking forward to professors having fully auditable class participation grades included in their scoring rubrics, and the ability to send footage off to student conduct."
