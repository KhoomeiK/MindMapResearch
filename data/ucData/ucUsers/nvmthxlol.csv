Hijabis,fplbldk,t3_gdwpsa,1588709798.0,"You can't go wrong with hijabs, dainty jewelry or skin/body care.

I would contact your giftee to see what unique things they're interested in. I personally love basketball but no one would think to get me anything like that unless they knew."
learn_arabic,fpidigu,t3_gdld89,1588638674.0,"I’ve only seen this on a Lil Uzi Vert music video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WrsFXgQk5UI

Maybe he passed it off as an artistic choice."
Hijabis,fp9a7z8,t3_gbuap3,1588420106.0,"I always hated the idea that only Muslim women can wear head coverings and any other woman who does so is appropriating Islamic culture. It seems useless to dictate who can put a cloth on their head and who can’t, especially when head coverings have been a thing since before Islam and they’re a part of non Muslim cultures. 

Anyone can wear a head covering in any fashion. Especially since you mentioned it’s been a part of your culture for forever, you should feel free to cover your hair how you choose. 

It’s only when people mimic hijab to deliberately make fun of or criticize Muslims like the Australian senator that it becomes problematic (which isn’t what you’re doing).

fasting,fom3vhs,t1_folxcdi,1587877592.0,I’m new here. What does it mean when people say they’re doing a 5 day fast? Do they not eat any food for 5 days straight? I’m sorry if that’s a stupid question lol.
fasting,fom3ojq,t1_fom2ajc,1587877439.0,Does this mean you don’t eat any food at all for 5 days? Or do you get some food breaks?
MadeMeSmile,fom2qsv,t3_g85piy,1587876708.0,Which dog
HistoryMemes,foi4nem,t1_foi2r4a,1587778622.0,Yes! It’s a shame how long I had to scroll to find a comment that mentioned how problematic the canal and it’s history is.
Muslim,foi20r6,t3_g7ji09,1587777101.0,"Wa alaykum al salam, peace be upon you as well. 

Much appreciated. We’re all in this together. Stay safe, may your faith lift your spirits at this time."
berkeley,fodsyox,t1_fodss0h,1587689546.0,You’re right. Tuition only costs about 14k I’ll update that.
Muslim,fodnek9,t1_focjyr6,1587686842.0,You have public taraweeh prayers? They aren’t canceled where you live?
berkeley,fodmyhl,t1_fodkndz,1587686687.0,No I meant the total cost of attendance which is around 30k
berkeley,fod5dlv,t1_foczbal,1587680153.0,Thanks! I’m a rising sophomore but I’ll still meet with an adviser to make sure I know the entire process.
Hijabis,fo9dis4,t3_g60jey,1587616586.0,"A reminder of my faith. My experiences haven’t shaped me to be the best person in the world, but having a token to remind me of my islamic morals motivates me to be the best person I can be. 

It’s helped a lot in university, when I live islamically i can honestly say I feel more respected by my peers and coworkers. Some people say that dressing modestly allows people to respect you, that’s bs in my opinion. I’m judged for dressing modestly but the way I carry myself speaks volumes. 

The genuine, respectful, intelligent, understanding, forgiving person I try to be is all due to my hijab. Yeah these morals are things I’ve learned from Islam, but the hijab is what reminds me to practice them. 

I honestly I don’t want to imagine the type of person I’d be without it. I’m not saying that I’d be a horrible person without my hijab, but I don’t think I’d be as good a person."

NoStupidQuestions,fo426px,t3_g5im77,1587496925.0,"It’s never about the politician; it’s always about the politics. The families you’ve seen broken up did so because of differing morals, not because some politician. 

Supporting Trump, Bernie, Netanyahu, Corbyn or Bolsonaro is always deeper than the politician themselves because their politics have real impacts."

Yemen,fn16ncc,t3_fynj6w,1586555842.0,I would look up Yemeni tv shows on YouTube. The comedy shows are more interesting to watch but they scream a lot of their dialogue which gets difficult to understand if you don't speak the dialect already. I'd go for a dramatic/ soap opera type of show because they enunciate their words better.
berkeley,fmyuukt,t1_fmyg5s3,1586496456.0,Did it always start at 9 am?

Izlam,fmtqmqu,t3_fx9v82,1586377312.0,Living in the west it’s more like: when one person’s phone makes athaan but your mom tells you to wait until another phone makes athaan

learn_arabic,fmna8q1,t1_fmn94qq,1586221522.0,Omg **this**. Growing up in the west and not having such passionate expressions in the English language made this expression so scary to me the first time I heard it. I don't think I've fully process its depth to this day.
berkeley,fmn7ulj,t3_fw8f1q,1586220051.0,that fade tho
AskReddit,fmn7jy7,t3_fwajk0,1586219874.0,"For example, while ""you warm my heart"" means someone makes you happy in English, a warm heart in Arabic is an irritated soul. And while a ""cold heart"" is someone who is evil and bitter in English, it actually means someone is at peace in Arabic. 

Any other instances of this in other languages?"
learn_arabic,fmn64r6,t1_fmn57l3,1586219004.0,LOL that's so interesting. So a Levantine English speaker would have a witty expression on hand whether or not their judgment was correct
teenagers,fmmufte,t1_fmmp7u6,1586212295.0,"yikes... well those are all based on initial physical attraction. focus on being a dope person overall and you'll attract the right one for you. besides, why chase women that are covertly racist and believe your race is less desirable? boss up and you'll do fine"
