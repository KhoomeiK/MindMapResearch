ucr,fpgnkt2,t3_gd8s0p,1588606142.0,"I took 8C over the summer a few years ago and scored exactly average on both midterms. Went into the final with basic ass studying (probs like 4 hours) since I had given up because I studied so hard for both those midterms only to do exactly average, so I just memorized a few synthesis steps and was like ""fuck it flow of electrons this bitch"" while fully expecting a C. Somehow ended up getting like 40 points above average on the final and that shit boosted me to an A- ahaha. Dunno how tf it happened, I guesss the curve was fat as hell or someone really fucked up grading. Take that shit IMO! Although I do know someone who got a C in it so idk...

As for the actual class, you aren't expected to memorize as much cause its a condensed term so I fully recommend it. I had Casselman for 12A and 12B, Casselman tends to drill you more on multistep synthesis so his tests are straightforward. Switzer's tests were more based on fundamentals so memorizing mechanisms isn't enough, he'll throw you some curve balls that are designed to make you think. I got the a B-/B+/A- in 12a/12b/12c, respectively. Take that as you will."

I also made a petition to this dude to swap in some EE classes instead of doing some major tech elecs that are trash and he said that ""my petition was laughable""."

I suggest you hit up the internet and see if there are any mentorship opportunities in your town. Sounds like you need some guidance which is what mentors are for.

antinatalism,fman9di,t3_ftvhn0,1585900197.0,"Yo, I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm also an anti-natalist but I feel like people should turn to suicide only if they are in a state of extreme suffering. You're right: humanity has a track record of doing horrific shit, life is totally unfair, and our existence is meaningless. 

But I think humans are great at distracting themselves with emotions. Personally, for me my goal is to push humanity towards forming a utopia or live selfishly and follow ones hobbies. IMO, important points of antinatalism are 1. not to bring someone into a world of suffering, 2. reducing human suffering for each other while we are alive. You can do this through living your own hedonistic life, helping those in need, trying to change society, or just through a conversation. :-)"
