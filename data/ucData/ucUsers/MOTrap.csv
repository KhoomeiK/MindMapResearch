UCSantaBarbara,fntkzxn,t3_g3jees,1587243767.0,"You shouldn't not major in physics because you have a weak foundation right now. Everyone has to start somewhere. I know a few people who didn't even start out as a physics major and are now doing physics in grad school. The point of a physics education in college is to get you a good foundation, and the physics program at UCSB definitely helps get you there (but this also means that it's quite tough). 

But as a (pessimistic) physics grad student, I should also say, you shouldn't major in physics just because you can work your ass off and do it. Physics as a subject is hard, and staying in academia as a physicist is even harder. Most physics majors (even most physics grad students) end up doing something non-physics after their degrees. This was not as big an issue in the past because physics students are well respected for their problem solving skills and ability to learn quickly. But it is less so these days because college/master programs are so developed and specialized now. The fact that physicists know or can learn a bit about everything doesn't compete well with, say a stat major or comp sci major, for a data science or machine learning job (just an example of what's hot right now but the idea applies to other area.) This means that, at least I think, the input to output ratio of a physics degree is quite low in general. I think that's a good thing to keep in mind."
tabletennis,fncp8iv,t3_g0p506,1586842861.0,"I switched from cpen to shakehand 2 years ago, and I do feel like it's worth it. Here are some pros and cons

Pros:

Backhand gets significantly better, especially on defense. I used a combination of RPB and traditional backhand before and I was never good enough to decide which one to use quickly. Now that I use shakehand, that's not an issue any more.

Transition from a backhand loop to a next shot with forehand gets easier. I guess this is because I used a pretty aggressive RPB grip before, but with shakehand my grip adjustment is smaller (of course even with shakehand you can have a big grip adjustment from forehand to backhand, but I just tried to reduce it).

Cons:

Forehand push took me a long time to get used to. My wrist felt awkward at the beginning. It's also harder to control the shot because compare to penhold, my fingers are further away from the point of contact (one can use Timo's trick but I don't want to complicate things). Creating spin variety (especially for top spin) in serves is also harder. I guess this has to do with the fact that the range of motion in the wrist is smaller even if I use the Waldner grip."
UCSantaBarbara,fmpvphl,t3_fwnzx0,1586288203.0,"Accessibility: 

Materials in both courses are more or less self contained, although some ""basic"" stuff tend to be covered fast. For 110A I'd highly recommend brushing up on some multivariable calculus before the course start since some professor may want to skip the first chapter on Griffiths' Introduction to Electrodynamics, the canonical book for a course like this. Since you have gone through Physics 1-4, you probably have some nodding knowledge on at least half of the concepts in 110A, but the course puts them on mathematical steroid.

I have less experience with 115A, but from what I heard the experience can vary and it depends on who's teaching it. As opposed to 110A, this course introduces new concepts and new framework to look at nature. But that also means that you'll encounter possibly new math to describe them.  Accessibility can depend on teaching style, but generally speaking, the more you know about linear algebra (vector spaces and their dual, inner products) and fourier transform) the more accessible quantum mechanics is.

&#x200B;

Interest:

Obviously, if you're more interested in the quantum aspect of material/chemistry then 115A is more interesting. If you're more into optical or magnetic side of material then 110A is the way to go. 

Personally I  was really into electrodynamics before I took it because Maxwell equations are famously elegant and powerful, but after taking a class like 110A/B I'm just annoyed/bored of it. For quantum, I had two experiences. The first time I took a quantum class, it was all about solving the Schrodinger equation. It's still quantum and conceptually new to me, but it was boring. The second time round, we started with spin 1/2 system and angular momentum, which are extremely quantum and interesting, but the linear algebra part challenged me more."

Double integral is not as monstrous as it appears if we realize we are just doing the usual integral twice. The important thing to keep  in mind is the upper/lower limit when we do such integrals (see around the 5min mark of the video)"
