1. Regional dominance by one brand over the other
2. The restaurant selection differs to some degree between the two, making you more like to meet a grub hubber"
DotA2,fpexlwj,t1_fpen8r4,1588557144.0,"That doesn't seem true to me. PA has a lot of built-in attack speed with her blink strike, so I would expect damage to perform better. Have you tested this?"
investing,fp51ltj,t1_fp4n26y,1588313422.0,"I think it is good news. BA securing funding on its own terms means no potential bad news about a bailout on bad terms. Debt weighs on a company, but at this point people expected Boeing to need to raise money somehow."
investing,forn5zg,t1_foqvy6o,1588015060.0,"Meh, I disagree. I donâ€™t think weâ€™re going to see a ton of growth from here in the short term, but in the long run we will, and I donâ€™t see us retesting lows again. Terrible earnings are expected for this quarter. Many companies, especially the biggest, havenâ€™t even taken that big of a hit to earnings. For companies with uncertain futures in heavily impacted industries, bankruptcy is heavily factored into their current prices. 

My current strategy is fairly bullish, but more oriented around selling theta than looking for significant short term upside."
investing,foqtpwd,t1_foqhhls,1588000657.0,Because they expect any depression effect on earnings to be gone within the next quarter or two.

As far as suggestions, maybe make up a boyfriend that you mention early on to project or lab partners casually.  I donâ€™t know what you can do about the condescension. To be honest, itâ€™s something I ran into quite a bit myself as a guy in CS, though probably not to the same extent. I would chalk it up to people trying to be helpful with limited social skills and experience teaching. Also sometimes people try to cover up their own lack of understanding by talking about something tangential or explaining something more basic. Itâ€™s definitely frustrating. 

I ended up having a  CS roommate that I knew was chill, and we coordinated schedules to work together most semesters. Thatâ€™s the most concrete suggestion I can giveâ€”find someone that isnâ€™t creepy/condescending and then take the rest of your classes at Cal with them lol."

wallstreetbets,fo1oskk,t1_fo16r87,1587438016.0,Theyâ€™re smart enough to realize theyâ€™re not that smart ðŸ˜…
thetagang,fnx5tiz,t1_fnwqjlm,1587332053.0,"What you shared is just a standard iron condor, not a reverse iron condor. If you swapped the sells and the buys on both the call leg and the put leg, then it would be a reverse iron condor."
thetagang,fnwmbih,t1_fnttndi,1587321118.0,"But thereâ€™s no payoff from time. Youâ€™re buying a call thatâ€™s lower than youâ€™re selling and buying a put that is higher than youâ€™re selling. You put money in at the start, and if the stock doesnâ€™t move, you lose money. Debit spreads are option purchases with a different risk profile while credit spreads are option sales with a different risk profile. A reverse iron condor involves buying two debit spreads."
investing,fnwghk5,t1_fnwata2,1587317931.0,Because the market only does these things because individuals themselves try to do these things.
investing,fnm4sz4,t3_g1stqc,1587065098.0,"Iâ€™m long Wells Fargo right now, selling strangles to earn some income. I think thereâ€™s substantial upside in the long term at these prices."
wallstreetbets,fnjdw55,t1_fne2k9z,1586996998.0,"Well, stock buybacks at a time when shares are cheap at least makes more sense than the companies that were doing them at all time highs."
wallstreetbets,fnhprt0,t1_fnf53fd,1586966728.0,"Iâ€™ve been looking at used S vs new 3 and was leaning towards the 3 because you get the newer self driving tech. That said, what made you regret your choice?"
wallstreetbets,fnf01ex,t1_fneevir,1586898950.0,"Actually, Iâ€™m not arguing that. Iâ€™m just arguing that labor has opportunity cost in the same way that money does. Not sure where you got the idea I didnâ€™t think the banks would benefit from making the loans."
wallstreetbets,fndv6hs,t1_fndlebz,1586878092.0,"Thatâ€™s incorrect... that money could still be spent on things other than labor if the company fired the employees. Or they could tell the employees to do something else with that paid time, and that other thing would be the opportunity cost."
wallstreetbets,fncxqfw,t1_fnci4ds,1586850906.0,There is the opportunity cost of having your employees work on making those loans.
wallstreetbets,fn9ydmg,t1_fn7pfs4,1586787365.0,Or you would have had to buy 250 some thousand bucks of SPY.
investing,fn780o3,t1_fn72017,1586715086.0,"I think people will go back to normal life. I wonâ€™t be avoiding malls, restaurants or theaters once the economy opens up. I hope a lot of people think like me."
wallstreetbets,fmql3ql,t1_fmq1tx6,1586301743.0,"More like, certain companies with very profitable long-term outlooks can grow more quickly and flourish through the use of debt and equity funding."
wallstreetbets,fmq4mih,t1_fmq44z0,1586292781.0,"Personally, I would move, say, 2400 into an account that you can use to continue to make high-risk bets, then put the rest into long positions in stocks you believe in. That way, you've still doubled your play money, but you're putting aside some of your earnings into a less-volatile environment."
wallstreetbets,fmf51g4,t1_fmc310x,1586020074.0,Yeah but better for the number of infected to skyrocket again than to collapse the economy and keep people out of work til August.
