Unfortunately, there are too many people who vehemently oppose the idea of such safety nets, even though we certainly have the capability to set them up."
berkeley,fp4137g,t1_fp3k17k,1588289615.0,"The point of the shutdown is to avoid overwhelming hospitals. I have no faith in the ability for people to self regulate how they interact with others during a pandemic. I mean, just look at how people were acting when they knew about Covid-19 but there were no stay at home orders. No one really changed their behavior. If people were to keep interacting with each other as we had before, we could very well overrun the hospitals with covid-19 patients."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fp1hirg,t1_fp1dtbu,1588235727.0,"Berkeley actually has a similar setup department wise, but the students have a lot of freedom when it comes to upper division courses. I’m technically an EECS major who took mostly CS courses, for example. Most people who are EECS at Berkeley do this.

The other CS major is in our college of letters and sciences, so they have some more breadth requirements and a couple less natural science requirements. Other than that, the classes a CS focused EECS major and a CS major can be identical.

However, you need to meet a certain GPA in your lower division CS courses to declare L&S CS, (3.3 for the last couple years, but it is definitely subject to change depending on how many students the program can support). 

EECS majors automatically declare, but the admissions for that major are highly impacted. It’s nearly impossible to declare an EECS major unless you were admitted as Engineering undeclared, as the waiting list is massive and so few people leave the major."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fp12ogn,t1_fp11qhp,1588222772.0,"Yeah, math at my high school didn’t really instill the kind of mathematical maturity that you have to have to succeed right off the bat in a rigorous CS education like you would find at CMU, or in my case Berkeley. I was more or less taught how to plug in equations, so it was an uphill battle catching up to the kids from better schools.

There are high schools that will *really* teach you math, but you generally only find them in highly gentrified areas such as the Bay Area with a heavy focus on STEM (because everyone’s parents are software engineers). These are the schools where half of the population ends up in Berkeley, Stanford, CMU, Caltech, etc."

The main disadvantage is that you’re stuck with headphones that are Bluetooth from oem, or you need to use a Bluetooth adapter with your existing cans (and a portable amp if your headphones need one). I guess the latency is an issue as well depending on the application."

berkeley,fo12311,t1_fo11wtn,1587424202.0,"The bins are adjusted if the average scores are too low. It’s effectively a curve. If many people cheat and inflate the average grade, they may not adjust the bins accordingly. 

I agree that they should put more effort into helping students, but that still doesn’t mean they shouldnt punish cheaters.

Edit: moreover, exam difficulty is also adjusted based on how the class is doing overall IIRC.

The core CS lower divs have a grade distribution that they aim for. While it’s theoretically possible for everyone to get an A, that will never happen and they make sure of that by adjust difficulty of exams."
berkeley,fo11mqv,t1_fo0tvwp,1587423945.0,"Because in a *curved class, cheating affects other students, not just your personal grade. When declaring a major like CS requires a certain GPA due to department limitations, then why would you want to let in the cheaters over the honest students who did almost as well without cheating? 

It’s not like individual hw scores matter in CS70 anyway, especially when you can take it P/NP this semester, so I actually think they’re being quite lenient. I flunked every assignment when I took it 3 years ago and still got a B.

Edit: it’s effectively a curved class. They set bins to target a certain grade distribution and adjust the difficulty of exams to correct for students doing too well or too poorly."

pcmasterrace,fnnr1u5,t1_fnnq3y8,1587099264.0,"There’s also the fact that Vanguard is only updated upon starting the game. If a vulnerability is found and exploited, but you don’t open Valorant and get the corresponding security patch, you’re vulnerable until you do so. 

For some people, this may be weeks while their computer is on and running Vanguard. That’s plenty of time for someone to attack your computer. 

Now, if Vanguard only ran when you ran Valorant, Riot could check for any security updates BEFORE even running Vanguard to ensure that you are running the most secure version.

Furthermore, you are not going to be doing much else while playing a game with a similar anti cheat. That leaves less opportunity for attack since you’re not as actively using the Internet. 

But guess what, Vanguard is going to be running when you’re watching your Jett R34 on hentaiXXX.net. If you get attacked with a Vanguard exploit, you’re fucked even though you weren’t even playing the damn game. Meanwhile, you’re probably safe from Battleeye exploits while watching Tracer get railed by cartoon dong because Battleye isn’t running with ring 0 privileges while you rubbing one out.


Accidentally hop onto a fake WiFi network at Starbucks? Too bad, Vanguard was running."
pcmasterrace,fnnng1e,t1_fnnmtjr,1587096581.0,"Ring 0 privileges give full, unprotected access to all of the hardware that Windows can see, so I’d probably have to hop into BIOS to enable the drive every time. Seems easier just to press a second power button lol.

That being said, I’m hoping they roll this back, or at least allow me to play on a VM so that I don’t have to do this. Either way, I enjoy building PCs so I won’t mind too much."
pcmasterrace,fnnn1i6,t1_fnnj75i,1587096288.0,"The issue isn’t necessarily the fact that Vanguard runs with ring 0 privileges. Think about it this way: a rogue program with 24/7 ring 0 privileges is generally called malware.

Let me clear some things up: many anti cheats have ring 0 privileges, but all of them (except Valorant) only run when the game is being played. 

The problem is that Vanguard runs even outside of game time, which gives a much larger window of opportunity for attack. IIRC, it doesn’t update until you run the game again, so you might have a vulnerability for weeks or months, even if it’s patched out. 

You run the risk of vulnerabilities in your system any time you run a program with ring 0 privileges. It’s just that for some reason, riot has deemed it necessary for Vanguard to run 24/7. 


As for kernel (ring 0) vs user/admin mode (ring 3):

Ring 3 is quite restricted. Programs with ring 3 access can only access virtual memory and usually only the memory allocated for that program. Furthermore, it can only access hardware through syscalls (it asks the OS nicely to perform some action with some hardware).

Ring 0 allows full, direct access to hardware, including physical memory and storage. This makes it very easy to crash your windows, or even worse, completely brick your current install. Non malicious programs won’t do anything harmful on their own, but an exploit could allow an attacker to do all sorts of things to your system. Hence why you want to limit the amount of time a program has ring 0 privileges."
pcmasterrace,fnnhu00,t1_fnngxmy,1587092706.0,"Are we talking about games when it comes to how the average player plays or how professional players play? 500 hours is definitely enough to talk for the average gamer, even if I don’t understand the game at the most nuanced level possible. 

I’m talking about how it feels to play these games as your average gamer, because that’s what the vast majority people will experience. Not that many players reach 500 hrs, much less 2000 or 5000 or whatever your benchmark is."

pcmasterrace,fnnd07c,t1_fnncai7,1587089557.0,"Abilities aren’t necessarily “my thing”, otherwise I wouldn’t have 500 hrs on CSGO while overwatch existed. I can appreciate more than one aspect of a game than whether or not there are abilities.

I just think that the way Riot implemented abilities competitive 5v5 shooter with high skill gunplay like CSGO is a refreshing take on the genre."

pcmasterrace,fnn4e05,t1_fnn420y,1587084158.0,"I’m not worried about them stealing data as I take that for granted with Tencent games.

I’m worried about letting a potential vulnerability run for 16 hrs a day instead of 1 hr a day. I make the same choice when running any code on the kernel level, but that doesn’t mean I want it to run 24/7."
pcmasterrace,fnn3fpe,t1_fnn394r,1587083580.0,"I’m well aware that there are other kernel level anti cheats. The difference is that Vanguard is initialized upon boot and is monitoring you 24/7, not just when playing the game. There are even reports of Vanguard affecting performance in other games.

Either way, none of the other major modern anti cheats run 24/7 like Vanguard does."
pcmasterrace,fnmy2ap,t1_fnmq7ew,1587080407.0,"As someone who’s played all 3, it’s closer to CSGO than to over watch, it doesn’t even feel close to overwatch.

I’ve played hundreds of hours of CSGO and I have to say that Valorant is refreshing. It also feels like it has a lot more potential than CSGO. The abilities really do make a big difference in how the game plays and open the door to all sorts of play styles and starts that you can’t find in CSGO.

That being said, I’ll be closely following the anti cheat situation because, while I do trust Riot, I don’t trust a root kit. I may build a second PC from **spare** parts just to play this game if they don’t do anything to alleviate my concerns.

Edit: No, I’m not going to buy a whole ass PC for a single game, I’ve been building PCs for almost a decade and have plenty of parts for a second or even a third PC if I wanted."

Spellbreak,fmmga37,t3_fw4mqy,1586204726.0,"I find that toxic/anything with range works quite well, especially when paired with shadowstep. To me, the abilities of fire aren’t good enough compared to toxic to justify maining fire if I am going DF that game.

The burst damage of toxic is ridiculously high, especially if you have focused mana, are stealthed, and recklessness is proc’d. Obviously, you need a gauntlet with a more range, as toxic has a short effective range and a slow projectile. 

The second gauntlet you use is really up to you, I’ve found the most success with wind and lightning, but I mainly use those as poking damage when I can’t hit with toxic. Fire obviously can be used as well, though I tend to not since I want to be able to reuse my toxic cloud during fights for more stealth and mobility."
