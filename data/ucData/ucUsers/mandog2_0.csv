Mostly everybody minds their own business, so you can go either way. The academics are competitive, but not in the sense that someone will try to sabotage you. I was honestly surprised at how collaborative everyone is. Ultimately the decision is up to you but I couldn't recommend UCLA enough! I feel as if it is pretty chill honestly. Good luck!"
ucla,formcqp,t1_for8vmx,1588014663.0,Okay will do! Thanks for the advice
ucla,for8hdb,t1_for8789,1588007964.0,"I was really confused, he said in class he gives 8 points free and then on the rubric it says each category of questions is 45 points and each week is five percentage points and you get five free so I want to say yes but then he said 8 in class??"
ucla,for83ak,t1_foqwsvj,1588007774.0,Yeah I feel like the prof wouldn't give me back the points? I mean its worth a try but it was week 4 so rip
ucla,for80jh,t1_foq2w7z,1588007738.0,LS 7A - I just bought it. I knew I'd have to buy it eventually but I was holding off because it was expensive but I shouldn't have.  It's just been hard to keep track of everything I have due because my inbox is so flooded...I know it's my fault but its a bummer. Thanks though.

ucla,fn27phf,t1_fn1zm3g,1586580183.0,it's only been a day but I really like it! He's engaging (imo) and I think the subject matter's pretty interesting.
ucla,fn1r8q9,t1_fn0fpgd,1586568248.0,"Thanks so much! If this isn't too much, do you think you could send me notes from the first three lectures (not today's), he hasn't posted or recorded the zoom and I've emailed both him and the TA but they haven't really provided anything to fill that information."
