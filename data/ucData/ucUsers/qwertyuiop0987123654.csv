berkeley,fpam72s,t3_gcd5jj,1588451040.0,Dang what happened? R u alright?
berkeley,fp9h0vz,t3_gc035y,1588425964.0,Honestly the hardest part about hilfinger‚Äôs projects is probably style check. The 60-line limit for each method is a pain in the ass.
collegeresults,fp6fca5,t3_gbh89w,1588351373.0,"Definitely Princeton. As an engineering student, I‚Äôd choose Princeton over Georgia Tech even if I didn‚Äôt get any money from Princeton."
berkeley,fp48fiz,t3_gb7z74,1588293774.0,P/NP. Having a 2.7 GPA looks a little bad (no offense) if you wanna apply for summer 2021 internships in fall 2020.
berkeley,fp3xb81,t1_fp3oxlr,1588287546.0,"Ok but this is only true for Cali schools. To maximize OP‚Äôs admissions chances to cal (assuming they‚Äôre OOS or international), OP should rlly do beyond just maintaining straight As."
berkeley,foy5xn7,t3_ga7h3g,1588166059.0,U won‚Äôt be refunded after making a deposit. And Unit 1 is closer to campus than Unit 2 by a block. Not much of a difference besides the fact that u have to walk one additional block to campus everyday.

berkeley,fol6n9x,t1_foi9692,1587855920.0,Ok thanks!

berkeley,fo0if17,t1_fo0g4xk,1587413703.0,"Yea that was an edge case for sure, but if you really stay on top of things, 61C and 70 will be manageable."
berkeley,fo0g1hh,t3_g4zp6b,1587412473.0,"Yea if you take both at the same time without overloading yourself with another heavy tech course then it should be manageable. I have a friend who took CS61B, 61C, and 70 in one semester and got easy As in all three."
berkeley,fo0aija,t1_fnzu2qx,1587409086.0,"Haven‚Äôt taken 16B yet, but I plan on taking 16B with Ranade in spring 2021. I took 16A with her last semester and it was a wonderful experience (if we forget about Boser‚Äôs lectures). I got an A as a result of her clear notes and patience in clarifying every single detail of the lectures."

berkeley,fnek3y5,t1_fnehnn2,1586890792.0,"If the first few weeks go online, then the entire semester is prob gna be online. It‚Äôs unfair for international students to have to physically be on campus in the middle of the semester."
berkeley,fne0rwv,t3_g189pf,1586881026.0,I was waitlist 46 when I enrolled yesterday. Somehow got off the waitlist this morning lmaoo. My friend who was waitlist 55 got off w me as well. Good luck!
berkeley,fn8iyva,t1_fn86mg5,1586742724.0,"Being waitlisted for class wasn‚Äôt really an issue for me. I‚Äôm currently a freshman and I‚Äôve been pretty lucky with my class enrollment times. My psych and cogsci major friends never had the issues either. I guess it‚Äôs because the classes we chose were big classes that had many seats open. 

On a side note, I‚Äôve visited JHU before applying (and getting rejected) and I thought it has a really really beautiful campus. However, it‚Äôs surrounded by the Baltimore ghetto area, and honestly Berkeley seems safer than Baltimore. Both schools are known for grade deflation so getting a good GPA is gonna be hard either ways. Feel free to PM me if u have any more Qs!"
berkeley,fn85p4n,t3_g06i19,1586734451.0,"I‚Äôm also an international student (from East Asia). Personally I chose Berkeley over other top tier schools such as Duke, CMU, Northwestern (I didn‚Äôt get into JHU hahaha) because 1) Berkeley‚Äôs CS major is honestly one of the best in the world, 2) its relative proximity to SF, Silicon Valley, and Seattle is very nice, 3) I‚Äôm 99% sure that I‚Äôll be returning to my home country after graduating and staying in the US for a few years. Most people in my home country have only heard of Berkeley but not the other schools that I mentioned above. I think having Berkeley on my resume would be incredibly beneficial if I were to start job hunting in my home country; and 4) Connection: a lot of people in the tech industry have graduated from Berkeley simply because of how big it is compared to private institutions. 
Good luck! Both schools are wonderful and u‚Äôll do great no matter where u end up going!"
