ucla,fn4e3ax,t3_fzfnjv,1586639492.0,Bruh I can’t even get a reply from my zoom group when I ask them a question right there on audio and webcam
ucla,fn2po2j,t1_fn2iwuu,1586598243.0,"Mainly you get to ask questions right when a topic is covered instead of holding onto them until zoom office hours, where they will most likely get glossed over as student questions jump sporadically from one topic to another. 

Another thing that I’ve noticed in my class is that the person who controlled the camera during the recording will often get distracted and not move the camera to show where the professor is on the board so sometimes it’ll get erased before you can even see it."

ucla,fn0uu8q,t3_fynhv8,1586549176.0,"If USAC can prove to us that they use their current finances efficiently and that the extra cost will actually result in meaningful improvements for the average student, I would probably be fine with it. 

The problem here is their response to criticism. Instead of convincing us, they’re calling us idiots and trying to suppress opinions against their plans."
ucla,fn0gbmh,t3_fykspp,1586541415.0,"Give them a break, monitoring Reddit posts and downvoting them is tough work"
ucla,fn0cjqo,t3_fyjyls,1586539450.0,"Lmfao another clown who thinks his private group chat makes it ok to say stupid shit like this. 

We need more funding for the USAC Reddit brigade fighting on the front lines of the upvote buttons!"
ucla,fn09r2m,t1_fn08415,1586537995.0,Some professors are just making us watch old recordings of their lectures though. I think there is some value to a live lecture that is lost in this. You can basically already do this for free for many courses taught throughout the country’s best institutions just on YouTube alone. At best it’s just lazy.
ucla,fmtqxg7,t3_fxdwls,1586377461.0,Sometimes I have to bring my laptop with me to take a dump during zoom lecture and I’m terrified of the camera or microphone turning on accidentally.
ucla,fm6rbgr,t1_fm6hvvf,1585801074.0,I’ve seen a few videos of people doing it. Almost all of them sound like stereotypical edgy 13 year olds. Imagine how sad it is to be doing this in your twenties though.
