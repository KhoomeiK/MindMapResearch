berkeley,fow6rqz,t1_fow6ozj,1588114059.0,You saw the link right? Is my situation abnormal? It seems that I have 17 units
berkeley,fotoff8,t1_fotf99r,1588060455.0,also 7 units techs
berkeley,fotocxq,t3_g9ib6q,1588060390.0,"Dont do this. 61B is very important, and is a pretty decent workload by itself, even without it being taught by hilfinger. Math 54 isn't the easiest math class and has a decent workload as well, and combining them at the 2x speed is a bad idea. Though together during the semester its fine to combine them"
berkeley,fno6i3j,t1_fnnh7lq,1587113901.0,A class being incomplete doesn't matter though right? We would still get the 2 or 3 Units counting for the Upper Div Requirement
berkeley,fnkl5cv,t1_fnkjujc,1587031245.0,"I agree that there's nothing wrong with doubling in DS, but I'd also like to add that it's not for everyone. The extra major won't add too much value if you're set on a career with something like software engineering. However, the fact that you're looking for extra classes to take because you ran out of breadths, DS might actually be a good idea."
berkeley,fnkj61p,t1_fnkixiu,1587029055.0,You can just take random filler classes that interest you. You don't have to always take something required of you every semester
berkeley,fnkj2ez,t1_fnkitnw,1587028946.0,"Are you a freshman currently? If so, why not spread out the classes a little more than you have them now? You have a lot more time ahead of you to take other classes."
berkeley,fnkivz5,t3_g2b9em,1587028748.0,"hug

hands down and this is the only right answer. Unless you're trying to declare early or smth, then BL would be okay. But for the class itself, don't take it with some random TA's, do it with Hug"
berkeley,fnkimqo,t1_fnkifx1,1587028471.0,"The 4th tech makes it worse, but removing it doesn't take away from the fact you're putting 3 very high workload classes all together in the same semester. I wouldn't try this UNLESS you have high grades in both 61A and 61B AND you've handled high workloads in previous semesters.

What grade did you get in 61A if you don't mind sharing?"
berkeley,fnki1p5,t1_fnkhj1h,1587027837.0,"Bro thats much much worse..

16B is worse than 16A, 61C is a higher workload than 61B (with hug)

And then you plan to add another tech which makes it even harder. I'm by no means saying its not doable, but you're trying to declare and it's gonna be really difficult with 4 techs"
berkeley,fnkh9vm,t3_g2a66o,1587027000.0,Don't combine 70 with 61C if you're trying to declare and don't have high grades from the other 2 pre-reqs to fall back on. 61C workload is pretty massive.
berkeley,fnkh4x0,t3_g2b1yc,1587026851.0,"I wouldn't take cs61b , ee16a, and cs70 in the same semester if you're trying to declare. Might be too high of a workload depending on the person and how they manage with high workload schedules. Data 8 is easy af though so I'd go with that instead of 70. 61b, data8, and ee16a is pretty doable."
berkeley,fnfqxnh,t1_fnfopvm,1586913612.0,I believe it's all classes
berkeley,fnfpx1n,t3_g1hxke,1586913006.0,"EECS is probably going to implement P/NP according to their FAQ

berkeley,fnfpq1y,t1_fneed7t,1586912891.0,"Is there no linear algebra when Sahai isn't teaching? Or is there still a little bit, just not as heavily emphasized as Sahai does it."
berkeley,fnd7mt3,t1_fnd7cbv,1586861853.0,"I thought so, but some people were telling me I was just gonna fail the shit out of 70 without having taken 54/16A first and that failing that hard is worthless, and I might as well take 54 first."
berkeley,fnd7ke9,t1_fnd7bmn,1586861783.0,"Probably if Spring 2020 policies carry forward over to this summer. Though I dont think it makes a difference because I'd have to take it again anyways. Haven't taken 16A for it to replace a P, and I don't plan on taking 16B anytime soon."
berkeley,fn4rkr7,t3_fz8omd,1586647442.0,Why are you unsatisfied with UCSD?
berkeley,fn4r9w6,t3_fzkf87,1586647257.0,"For EECS it is likely that Spring grading options will carry over if that matters at all for you.

berkeley,fn2mzv5,t1_fn2kmtp,1586595149.0,I signed up solely for the p/np possibility. I'm 14 on the waitlist but I doubt I'll make it
berkeley,fmzjpl8,t1_fmzfhrl,1586522467.0,The whole point was taking 54 first and taking 70 alongside 110 lol. But thanks anyway.
berkeley,fmzjek1,t3_fyce6s,1586522217.0,"I'd wait til Fall when Hug is teaching. Will probably be a much better experience not only because Hug is a world class proff but also because Summer will be 2x as fast as a normal semester.
If you are anxious and don't feel like you would be able to perform well with the 2x speed, then just take in in the Fall.

Also just as a note, if you are by chance trying to go into CS, you won't want to get ""carried"" by some OP person. This is a crucial class and learning how to manage bigger projects and understanding essential data structures is really important."
berkeley,fmyxroz,t1_fmywpd7,1586499127.0,It seems like I'll just be taking 70 along with two other breadths then. Thanks for your input! Hopefully I can make a B lol
berkeley,fmyg5gp,t3_fy5km4,1586485374.0,"Currently there is no curve in 70, so there might not be one in Summer either."
berkeley,fmodg9o,t1_fmobhm6,1586254913.0,Take it during Fall. The class is hard for lots of people like the person above me said.
berkeley,fmob02q,t3_fwhjcr,1586252197.0,CS61A over the Summer will count for the Major Declaration process and will factor into the 3.3 required GPA. It's just like taking it any other semester except the class is taught by TA's instead of Denero and the content goes twice as fast.
berkeley,fmn9emx,t3_fw8ya9,1586220999.0,"just buy a macbook and be done with it
classes are going to be so much easier to setup and if you aren't worried about the price then ur good"
berkeley,fmm57lq,t1_fmlvozo,1586199010.0,"Oh I forgot to mention that I would be taking 1B at a Community College, and since grades dont factor into your GPA through CC, It would be much easier than if I was doing it through Berkeley"
berkeley,fmkv6n6,t1_fmkugc7,1586169904.0,EE16A is different than Math 54 though because EE16A has no differential equations whereas math 54 does.

3dshacks,dl1tjjs,t3_6qmfv5,1501656720.0,"Hi, I have taken a break from the 3ds hacking scene for a long while and I wanted to get back in to it. I picked up my old 2DS and played some Pokemon for a few hours. The next day I plug my SD card into my computer, and I noticed some really weird files on the root of the SD. I plugged the card back into the 2DS, and a few of my games cause freezes. Just hovering over my copy of Pokemon X or Alpha Sapphire causes the screen to freeze, and trying to boot Sm4sh does the same. It has been a while since I hacked my 2DS, but I used A9LH and Luma3ds for my cfw. I'm on Luma 7.0.5 and firmware 11.5.0. Currently, I have access to many things on the 2DS, like FBI, themely, JKSM, a few of my other CIA installed games like Pokemon Moon, and youtube. I also have full access to writing to and copying from the SD card. I already backed up my saves using JKSM in case anything goes wrong. When I try to use the settings app, I have functionality of most things except for the data manager. I cannot view any software, extra data, saves, or DLC within the manager. The blue spinning box just keeps going forever.

So, I've thought a bit and I think that I'd like to just reset my system to what it was before I did the hack, and rehack it using B9S this time as the CFW. I am not entirely sure how to go about this process and I'm a little bit confused. I'm also not sure what firmware I was on originally when I first hacked the 2DS using Plailect's guide. I do have some random NAND backups (Like 3 or 4) and I do not know which firmware my system was on when I backed them up. I also tried copying over things from my corrupted SD to another one except for the Nintendo 3DS file due to its file size being too large to fit onto my new SD. After doing this, my device booted up on firmware 11.0 if that means anything."
