raiders,fp2p3fg,t1_fp2otv0,1588265522.0,yeah I remember he wasn’t the same after that big hit week 1. Conley was looking damn good that first game. But after the hit he looked scared the rest of the season before we traded him. But yeah I feel like I do always remember watching him get burned when it mattered most lol.
raiders,fp2oizm,t1_fp222si,1588265256.0,"I totally agree. Some of the most nfl ready corners came out of OSU. Buuuuut, Conley also went to OSU so it’s still a two way street. Such a damn shame he ended up being such shit I was really excited for him when we drafted him"
warriors,foyqw03,t3_gaav4m,1588177511.0,"I remember seeing curry, I don’t know what year or what game, drill a three in the corner standing only on his toes because if his heels were down they would have been out of bounds. The coordination and awareness is crazy"
UCSantaBarbara,fotjdbi,t3_g99gxm,1588055730.0,"This is absolute horse shit. EEMB and MCDB faculty are always on reddit so they need to take some time and read through these comments. Starting your sophomore year in the bio department, intro bio faculty (outside of Mike and Lalo) make it their goal to FUCK you out of the major. They do not give a single shit about the success of their students and would rather see a majority of their students fail than see them succeed. They purposely schedule midterms and finals that end up being on the same days or back to back days to fuck students. They offer classes once a year to fuck students. They don’t give a shit and they never will. Their goal is to weed out as many kids as possible.  The weeder classes start sophomore year and they feel like they never end. Do you want to do anything besides general bio? Sorry, if you fail any upper div, you’re fucked. There is no valid reason to force people to take classes for a letter grade during a pandemic, all this will entail is the promotion of negative behavior, like cheating, so kids have to fight for a letter grade, even though almost every other college in the nation is allowing for p/np. I love UCSB as a school but the bio department is just inconsiderate, and it shows. They want you to fail. They brag about how many kids change their majors at spring insight. This is expected from them, but it is still disappointing."

warriors,fmmgxhz,t1_fmmfdbz,1586205063.0,"Honestly, I was surprised Curry and him had such like a normal conversation about whatever. I feel like i’ve heard he’s a pretty decent guy off the court even though he’s such a bitch on the court. Like he knows his whining pisses people off the same way dray talking shit gets under people’s skin. I feel like a lot of us don’t realize that a lot of these people are capable of just leaving a lot of shit just on the court"
nba,fkcxn96,t1_fkcr53n,1584063535.0,Thank god because the finals occurring during finals week at my college has been such bullshit
