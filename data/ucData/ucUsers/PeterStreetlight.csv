UCSC,foczpz8,t3_g6pfkq,1587678021.0,"ProctorU violates any possible privacy policy and I have already argued with senate committees that UCSC should NOT allow its use. 

And not only it violates privacy.  It violates the fundamental tenet that you have to show respect to students and treat them as adults.  If you treat them as if they were potential criminals, no wonder they want to start cheating in your classes. 

Using proctorU is akin doing a strip search & cavity inspection to everyone taking an exam, excep that the innards of ones' computer are generally more interesting than the innards of one's bowels."
