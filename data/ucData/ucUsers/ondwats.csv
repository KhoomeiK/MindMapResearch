UCSC,fpbvt6s,t3_gchp83,1588480041.0,"I dont know anything about the course, but the professor is INCREDIBLE. He's a grad student, and just incredibly intelligent, passionate, understanding...so great. I want to take it just bc he's teaching it if I can fit it into my Summer schedule. He gave lots of math history tidbits during a (non- history) math class I had with him, so I imagine he's very knowledgable/excited to teach a whole class about math history."
Feminism,fpa5841,t3_gc9atx,1588441060.0,"Disgusting. Letâ€™s not forget about the ~250 million (female) dairy cows we forcibly impregnate (aka, rape), use them for their milk, take their calves away shortly after birth, until the cow is deemed unprofitable and is killed. Just another commonly accepted form of male violence against non-human animals. Ditch Dairy, yaâ€™ll, go vegan."

UCSC,fovkyin,t3_g9rf8a,1588103076.0,"I go up several times a week, frequently see cops, nothing has happened to me. Remember people are still living on campus, and the express store (and maybe other places) are still open, so you won't have any trouble if you're just walking around."
UCSC,fopqjrl,t3_g8hve5,1587968944.0,"I haven't taken 111T, but took 111A and am in 111B and 117 now. So many of the concepts for 117 and 111B are lining up quite nicely right now, so I think having 117 as background would help, and learning about groups/rings/fields more generally could help solidify knowledge from 117.

Whether it's worth the money is for you to decide -- I definitely think it's possible to learn on your own, especially after having taken 117. Two texts you might want to consider are Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote (our current text for 111B), and Topics in Algebra by Herstein (the text used for 111A in Fall 2019). I hear Dummit and Foote is widely respected by mathematicians, so that might be the way to go."
