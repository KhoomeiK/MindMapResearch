ucla,fors6io,t1_fonlugd,1588017578.0,As a Poli Sci grad your not wrong. My friends like him but the material was on the heavier side even for theory. I didnâ€™t take his classes bc I didnâ€™t like political theory.
ucla,forrk62,t3_g8tn58,1588017267.0,I took Smurda for a different class. The exams were multiple choice more based on lecture. Book cones into play for TA stuff. Sheâ€™s one of the best lecturers I had at UCLA.

Test/Reserve Driver would be Josh Williams as he is underrated driving Gosselinâ€™s equipment and back in his arca days. 

Manufacturer would be Chevy"

ucla,fmqjc5m,t3_fwbwcw,1586300735.0,"Under normal circumstances they would require lettering grading for students in the major. However, I donâ€™t know if the counselors or the Dept chair sent out a blast email stating what theyâ€™re doing for grading because of covid-19. 
If you donâ€™t have an email from a counselor or the chair, reach out to one of the counselors or the Dept chair."

baseball,fmkfvct,t3_fvnsr5,1586153557.0,Yeah thatâ€™s The worse One. Definitely looks like Pocono. As a track athlete I ran on a track with 4 sharp turns like Indy Motor Speedway with a kind spot. That made for some interesting racing and weird spots for 400m or lower events
