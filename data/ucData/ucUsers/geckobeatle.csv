TheSilphRoad,fnar97d,t3_g0jazz,1586802417.0,"Not sure if Niantic has addressed this or not, but why do they give players one ranking across all three leagues? It doesnâ€™t make any sense. I was well on my way to rank 9 in great league, it took me over 1 week to adjust to ultra league where my ranking dropped down to ~1900, and I straight up havenâ€™t adjusted to masters because I donâ€™t have tina/Dialga. Instead, Iâ€™ve unintentionally tanked my rating just so I can get the stardust rewards from each set."
