Competitiveoverwatch,fpcgcrq,t1_fpca9j9,1588499583.0,"Lmao if you needed the casters to see him overextend practically every fight idk what to tell you man. 

But yes. I think in hindsight, it’s easy to say yeah, he was testing and see how far and aggressive he could go with Echo. Even knowing how the map ended as a draw, I don’t particularly blame him because it’ll probably benefit his future play on echo. Even if they had lost the entire match from his over extensions and testing (which wouldn’t have happened lmao), I wouldn’t have been upset because it would help him understand what he can do in an OWL level match in the hero."
Competitiveoverwatch,fpc6c6p,t1_fpc43e4,1588489081.0,"Yeah that would actually be believable. It’s felt like that a few times for the shock this season, especially against the Valiant and the Gladiators. They just switched things like every map and it was weird."

Competitiveoverwatch,fozrvfj,t1_fozqoon,1588195776.0,"2-2-2 has been such a huge conversation on here lately. 

For someone playing at Sinatraa’s elo/OWL, I can totally understand why the role lock hurt his interest in the game. He can’t go between his favorite/best heroes really anymore, and it also hurts OWL teams in terms of creativity (although GOATS might’ve still been meta otherwise idk). 

But damn, ladder sucked before because you’d get 4 dps every other game."

Competitiveoverwatch,fnysyxk,t1_fnyoq1f,1587374499.0,"Yeah it’s made OWL mildly more interesting for the more average matches (ie: not the top teams), but when there was a solid meta, there were some crazy battles that I could definitely name off the top of my head. 

But in regards to casual comp, idk about you, but I’m mid plat, and it really didn’t matter what they played in OWL. Weird comps happened regardless. And while it *was* before roll queue, even after, you hardly ever got the OWL/GM meta. People in the majority of ranks played whatever the fuck they wanted half the time"
Competitiveoverwatch,fnysrzq,t1_fnyjtbl,1587374296.0,"I don’t even think it’s necessary to nerf everyone into the ground, but the power creep is just so strong that nerfing probably is the way to adjust the game at this point. 

I think a lot of approaches when people want the game adjusted is that they think about it in an effort to bring back a meta they happened to really like; in this communities case, a lot of people really want dive back. While nerfing is probably the best way to bring this game back to a decent, balanced nature, I don’t think we should be approaching it simply to make one meta more viable:"
Competitiveoverwatch,fnysjw3,t1_fny0cpq,1587374056.0,"Yeah the idea that it’s one group and not the other is total bullshit. If the OWL team didn’t want hero bans, they wouldn’t have hero bans.

*but*, it was just a really short amount of time.
