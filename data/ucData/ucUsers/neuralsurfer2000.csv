CreditCards,fpls2bf,t1_fplfz1m,1588718383.0,How much credit history? I only have around 7 months :/
chanceme,fplr46u,t3_gdpik6,1588717871.0,You could in theory get into anywhere you mentioned with those stats so just apply everywhere u might want to go and even more. Honestly you never know
chanceme,fplqvc8,t3_ge30ha,1588717738.0,"No chance don’t apply. Jk lmao, I got into Berkeley l&s last year with much lower stats (1410 sat) and 4.04 weighed. I was waitlisted but I got in later. Honestly college admissions are weird so just do the best application you can and apply literally everywhere u think u ever want to go even if you think u have 0% if getting in. I thought I would never get into Berkeley and through some magic I did so you really never know :/"
berkeley,fpdy0iu,t3_gcoje4,1588536500.0,Wait which problem are you on?
berkeley,fp36ml9,t1_fp35e11,1588274000.0,Do u think those averages are low enough to justify a bin shift? I think I final exams are either average or maybe slightly above average tho. I did really well on the first two midterms but on the first third of the final I did much worse than I normally do and I don’t think I did good on the second third either
berkeley,fp3503a,t1_fp1s8to,1588273185.0,Denero said a typical midterm 1 is 26 points and our average was 21. Also a typical midterm 2 avg is 60 percent and our average was 49%
berkeley,fow2aax,t3_g9wrnm,1588111696.0,Same :(
berkeley,fovfrb2,t1_fotuv84,1588100564.0,"I think that’s a good idea, or also just call coastline directly"
berkeley,fotunux,t3_g9ive6,1588066740.0,People across the world take classes at CCCs. I’m taking the equivalent to math1A there rn and there is no specific time requirement(although that one is specially designed to be online). My guess is that they won’t enforce specific time requirements but I would check into this
berkeley,fooxnfq,t3_g8otf6,1587948641.0,I’d recommend trying to create a go fund me to potentially try to pay off the care credit. I’m really sorry  you have to go through this :(
berkeley,fnkjujc,t1_fnkjpop,1587029811.0,Ohhhh I didn’t think about that. That actually helps my problem a lot now and it makes it easier for me to pull the trigger to decide to go for the double major. Thank you!!! :)
berkeley,fnkjjlr,t1_fnkje56,1587029471.0,"I was thinking about double majoring/minoring in data science but that’s probably the only other major I’d pursue.

Edit: maybe I’d minor in philosophy but that’s a bit of a stretch, I think I’d rather go for ds."
berkeley,fnkjbni,t1_fnkj61p,1587029225.0,"That’s true, I did want to try and graduate early but it might just be better to go a bit slower"
berkeley,fnkj97l,t1_fnkj2ez,1587029150.0,Yeah I am a freshmen. I definitely do have the ability to spread out my classes more but I was hoping to be able to graduate a semester or two early but hearing about how intense some of the techs are i think you’re right that it might be better to go a bit slower.
berkeley,fnkixiu,t1_fnkiths,1587028796.0,I don’t really want to take three/four techs but I have no breaths or anything extra left to take so techs are really my only option :(
berkeley,fnkitnw,t1_fnkimqo,1587028676.0,I’m in 61a still now and I think I’m on track to earn an A/A+ but I’m not sure how I will do in 61b. I don’t really have any breaths left to do or anything so I’m not sure where I should squeeze 70 in.
berkeley,fnkifx1,t1_fnki1p5,1587028267.0,"Oooof, how much does it change if I were to take 16b 61c and 70 without the 4th tech?"
berkeley,fnkie5k,t1_fnkhs99,1587028214.0,"I can’t pull up my scheduler rn but I’m taking Spanish and math1b at cc over the summer, 16a 61b data8 and a breath in fall, then i guess 16b 61c 70 and some other tech(probably something for data sci) for winter."
berkeley,fnkhnuc,t1_fnkgvmy,1587027420.0,Is taking cs70 with three other technicals doable if I take 16a first?
berkeley,fnkhj1h,t1_fnkh4x0,1587027275.0,"Do you think it’s doable to take 70 along with 61c, 16b, and one other technical? The reason is that’s what my next spring will look like"
berkeley,fnkfzuc,t1_fnjyatd,1587025624.0,Thanks!
berkeley,fllyuya,t3_fpnk74,1585270699.0,Blackwell is the best by far
