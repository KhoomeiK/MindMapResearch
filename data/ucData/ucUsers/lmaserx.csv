wallstreetbets,fpj408q,t1_fpj3pn7,1588655958.0,nice thing about tsla is its momentum swings usually stay for the whole day. so you can join in the rally half way through and still make a couple hundred per call

ucla,fpfataf,t3_gcbmt6,1588566012.0,"Honestly what if profs just embraced collaboration for this quarter? Like, oh no students are doing what they’re going to have to do when they enter the workforce. How’s this worse than universal pnp?"
ucla,fpf9zo2,t3_gcn7gv,1588565412.0,I’d also continue to review nachenburgs slides. A lot of projects use code straight from there
ucla,fpf9mha,t3_gcxl9o,1588565146.0,I would recommend combing through handshake and going to career fairs. Then I’d apply to 100+ internships and research the recruiting reps and continue staying in touch with them. Each company prioritizes different things in the resume so I can’t tell you to do something specific but in general the more work experience the better so I would recommend focusing on landing an internship. Start small and build up

wallstreetbets,fpe2kjx,t1_fpe1xo1,1588539091.0,"So you’re right that the death rate is probably a lot lower than currently reported. However, don’t forget what happened to ny, that only happened last month. We’re hoping that literally everyone in ny caught it at the same time, making it an exception in the US but still pretty apocalyptic"
ucla,fpe27on,t3_gcwy9g,1588538892.0,Jeez that’s harsh
ucla,fpdwwd6,t1_fpdv631,1588535864.0,"All I’m saying is that it’s a fact that people work harder under LG than pnp or this double A policy. So yeah, it’s more stressful when relatives are dying and I’m trying to study, but I wouldn’t be as motivated if it weren’t for LG and I’m certainly not alone. It sounds shallow but you can’t disagree that you learn more under LG, and ultimately that’s why you’re at ucla. Is it so unfair that people who can study despite having sick loved ones and immense stress get further ahead?"
ucla,fpdqf1k,t3_gclyjz,1588532143.0,Be sure to blink. It sounds weird but when we use screens we often blink less which leads to eye discomfort which leads to headaches. Just a tip
ucla,fpdq19a,t1_fpc6urc,1588531923.0,"I’m not saying I disagree, but just another factor to consider is the actual education we’re receiving. I know for a fact that I learn less when things are pnp, and for students entering the industry/med school that actually kinda matters. When people are designing things to protect people or save lives, it doesn’t really matter if they get good grades because they were stressed during covid, it matters if they know their shit. Basically, a lot of people would load up on the 6 hardest classes, learn less which could be dangerous for their profession, and it’d taint the A’s from previous quarters."
ucla,fpdp4ds,t1_fpcrqw2,1588531404.0,I know some profs make you use your phone to zoom yourself while you answer the quiz on ccle. It’s actually quite obvious to tell if a student is cheating if the phone is showing your face and hands. There’s usually 3 ta’s plus the prof so they just have to look at 40 students on a grid.
ucla,fpdol6l,t1_fpc3x1f,1588531102.0,"If you’re worried about grad school looking at this quarter, you can probably describe this situation to explain taking this quarter pnp. I wouldn’t worry so much about pnp breaking/making your chances at getting in."
ucla,fpdob98,t1_fpc1xoe,1588530946.0,"You’d have to check with your department. They’ve sent updates during the quarter, so double check"

ucla,fp72o50,t1_fp6hej7,1588362941.0,"If you want to avoid chegg sharing IP address to the school, you’re right, vpn is really the best work around. Some browsers like tor automatically use vpn in case you don’t have 2 devices"
ucla,fp6aofz,t3_gb9b46,1588349074.0,Data science is kinda the new hot field. Everyone needs a data person now to stay competitive. Stats is one of the top trending majors at UCLA for this reason— engineering department is considering not letting their students gain grad credit from stats classes because they’re so high in demand.
ucla,fp6adfb,t3_gb4ji7,1588348919.0,Doesn’t math department drop one mt?
ucla,fp6a6my,t3_gb8dh1,1588348824.0,"Don’t compare yourself to others. I would recommend just working through the rest of the quarter and consider p/np week 10. I had really bad grades my first year but you definitely get the “hang” of things your second year. once you’re allowed to work with people again, it can be easier to study sometimes. I pulled my gpa from 2.9 to 3.5 my second year."
ucla,fp67rrd,t1_fp51c1g,1588347608.0,"They can’t track your IP address.  That’s between your device and the server that you visit, so ccle can only see that you’ve accessed UCLA servers with your IP address. They can trace your browsers cookies and possibly check the cookies you receive from googling stuff but the easy work around would to use 2 browsers (e.i. safari and chrome)."
cscareerquestions,fp671rr,t3_gbfty0,1588347240.0,"This sucks, but be glad you have a job still. A lot of positions were canceled and people were let go. I think any of them would take rather be paid to be bored than just be bored."

ucla,foz03mu,t1_fox40i3,1588182354.0,"For any college, if you go onto your department website you can look at all the research your professors do, and usually they have a link to apply. Otherwise you can always email them directly. I know a lot of freshmen have gotten research by just emailing a bunch of professors"
ucla,foyzunf,t1_foxj6ov,1588182229.0,If you google UCLA transfer courses or something like that you’ll get a form that you can fill out with your equivalencies and it’ll tell you what to do from there
ucla,foyzfv8,t1_foxvc8c,1588182019.0,"Yes. I wouldn’t worry about major switching rn if prereqs overlap. But once we’re in session you can use message center to talk to counselors and review the change of major forms. Just FYI, stats classes are getting very difficult to enroll in, but are given priority to stats majors. So it may be in your interest to stay stats if they’re similar enough"
ucla,foyxgz8,t1_foy1byc,1588180997.0,"I haven’t found grade inflation to be an issue as most classes are difficult enough to be curved. Research is not as hard to get as you think. You can easily go to department websites and start emailing professors about their research and ask to join. Most freshmen I know have gotten into research if they just sent a few emails out. I personally think that working with Reagan hospital and the network at UCLA is going to give you a big head start over the state college. I also think working with UCLA students was something I took for granted. You learn about a lot of opportunities and have a lot of peer role models that are less likely to come by at a state college. I’d consider whether you would regret not going to UCLA 15 years from now, and if not definitely save yourself the financial burden"
ucla,foyvr8c,t1_foyto7o,1588180076.0,I mean you can always just not take it. Probably have to look online to see if you can get partial refund
