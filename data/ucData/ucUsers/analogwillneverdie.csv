berkeley,fopb1h2,t1_fnpxdtb,1587957096.0,I've heard lots of good things about her. She's a good choice for 110
berkeley,fop9fhn,t3_flfu42,1587956048.0,"Don't recommend it. I took CS70 the summer after my freshman year while doing research, and that was perfect (hard, but doable). 16B on top of that would be too much, considering that you should give yourself time to decompress/recharge over summer so you don't burn out."
berkeley,fop8em9,t1_fonxtpw,1587955392.0,"I 100% agree! I came to Cal intending to go into EE, but seeing the difference in culture between EE and CS pushed me all the way to the EE side. The only upper-div CS class i've taken is 152 . If you're more interested in software, maybe check out the EE120 series? Signal processing is pretty abstract and tends to involve a lot of Python/C programming."
berkeley,fop7h0r,t1_fooazc0,1587954791.0,"Seconded! Course staff and research have super-chill, high-achieving people. Most people who truly achieve highly aren't loud about it—if someone won't shut up about working at Facebook (something that wouldn't impress me for ethical reasons anyway) I assume they're overcompensating lol"
berkeley,fop6dzb,t3_g8an1k,1587954089.0,"Yep. I'm also a girl in EECS and I had this EXACT problem freshman year. Don't despair, though. People chill out as they mature. Try your best to ignore the shitty people, because there ARE good ones out there. I lucked out with lab partners: somehow, all of mine turned out to be gay guys and working with them was super chill (no skeeviness whatsoever, not condescending, worked hard). Sophomore year is when my EECS friend group really settled into place; when you start taking upper divs, make friends with the chill people and then you'll have a crew to study/take classes with. Also, it's really satisfying to see the people who were unbearably condescending to you freshman year ask you for help later on >:)

If I may suggest—a lot of eecs clubs can be pretty toxic, but course staff is not. If you want to meet a lot of genuine people who love eecs for its own sake, join the staff of a course where you feel like you could be friends with the TAs. Good luck out there"
berkeley,fop5fui,t3_g8r90g,1587953486.0,53 is lighter than 16B. I'd choose the latter list
