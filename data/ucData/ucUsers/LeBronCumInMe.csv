mirin,fmudh1b,t1_fmud04m,1586389246.0,Oh in that case I just want to let you know that it's a shame that an Indian woman is dating a white guy. Just fulfilling the stereotype. There's a lot of Indian guys out there hurting everyday because no woman wants them. I guarantee if you were a male you would be an incel too. I think you should look into giving Indian guys a chance.
