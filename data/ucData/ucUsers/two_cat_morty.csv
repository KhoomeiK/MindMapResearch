Regardless, you sound like you have very little respect for your wife. You are not paying your wife to do anything because she's not your employee. She is your *spouse* and you agreed to jointly run a household with her when you got married. Raising children is MORE than a full time job -- she can't help that that job doesn't come with any income. It's also certainly not doing ""fun activities"" all day. 

Your conversation probably went poorly because you were being disdainful toward her when she is supposed to be your equal. It's possible she could manage the chores once all the kids are in school without help, but you are never going to have a real discussion about that until you lose the superiority complex. Understand that YOU are not providing a housekeeper for HER, that running a household is NOT an easy job, and thst no one has to WANT to bust their ass to the maximum degree every day doing shit that no one wants to do when you are perfectly capable of hiring someone to help. What is the point of making a bunch of money if you're not willing to spend it on actually improving the happiness of the people in your household? Do you think on your wife's deathbed she will be thinking ""thank God I spent all those hours righteously slogging away at household chores instead of pursuing things that would have been fulfilling to me, because otherwise we would have had a little less money and my husband would have looked down on me.""

There is *plenty* of money out there to fund proposals like these, proposals that would do actual, tangible benefit to the welfare of American citizens.

This is such a bizarre and warped view of weddings that just reflects what a narcissistict travesty so many weddings are now. What is important is that the bride AND the groom have a happy and memorable day celebrating their love for each other in the company of their closest friends and family. Being the center of attention (and why is it always only the bride and not the groom who expects to be in the spotlight?) is completely irrelevant because a wedding is not a talent show or a catwalk or a movie set. Guests are naturally going to give a lot of attention to the bride and groom because they're *getting married*, but to go into your own wedding excited about how much people are going to have to look at you and admire how pretty you are is just so incredibly vain and selfish and sad. 

In my opinion it is 100% on the bride to make the bridesmaids comfortable. The bridesmaids are doing a favor for the bride, and today that often means spending a shit ton of your own time and money on a wedding that isn't even yours. Any bride who puts her own vanity ahead of her bridesmaid's wellbeing doesn't deserve to have bridesmaids."

There will be people on the ballot besides Trump and Biden in November. As the other person pointed out, it is my duty as a citizen to vote for the candidate I believe is best suited for the presidency. If I don't think that person is Biden, that is on *Biden* and the DNC. I think the principle you are trying to espouse is pragmatism, i. e if you don't vote for Biden you are *basically* voting for Trump. But that just factually isn't true. For one, third party candidates have gained real traction recently, and if they achieve a threshold of voters they will qualify for public funding and could really start to impact the political leanings of this country. It will VERY much matter if Democrats were forced to reckon with a sizable and growing number of true progressive voters in the electorate, even if no leftist candidate ever got close to winning the nomination (although I hope this changes eventually). Moreover, I want the DNC to know that I do not support their candidate (because I don't, at all). I think that eight years of Biden could very well be more harmful than four more years of Trump, firstly because his policies are pretty much still right or center compared to the rest of the world, but primarily because it will tell the DNC that it is okay to keep nominating pathetic centrist candidates *indefinitely*. I truly believe that the US continuing with this two party system wherein BOTH parties continually shift right and ever nearer to each other is one of the most pernicious trajectories possible for the people of this country. Voting for Biden does absolutely nothing to prevent that future."

I feel so gutted by all of this, deep down I just want someone to give me an actual good reason to vote for Biden that isn't ""he's not Trump"" so I can feel like this election wasn't an tragic waste of potential progress. But I don't think there is a good reason. I'll most likely be voting for Howie Hawkins."

If we burned down all of the forests today we would still have breathable oxygen for millions of years.

But I'm sure that doesn't make you feel any better because that's not your point. I understand that terrifying sense of everything beautiful around you being destroyed by people who only care about money. It makes me feel very helpless sometimes.

What specific things/movements/outlets are you interested in? I have found a very strong sense of purpose participating in my local DSA chapter. For the first time in my life I feel like I am actually making a small difference in other people's lives. Even if that's not really your thing, there is almost certainly a community of people out there somewhere that understands you. It can just be hard to find them sometimes."

This is because you wouldn't say ""I bought I tickets,"" you would say ""I bought myself tickets."""
WhitePeopleTwitter,fnf7boa,t1_fndq2kl,1586902736.0,"Can you elaborate then instead of just insulting people? Many progressives are very worried that Biden's ideology is barely different from that of Republicans (and that he would be a Republican if it had been more expedient for him in his home state). I have yet to see someone make a good argument as to how people's lives, particularly minorities and the working class, will be improved under Biden. People defending him seem to only be able to talk about Trump."
