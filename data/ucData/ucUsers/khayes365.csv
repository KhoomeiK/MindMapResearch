UCSD,fnumcs4,t3_g3xpkk,1587265548.0,"I’ve been feeling it too man, losing my schedule and sense of purpose has really gotten to me. Something that helps me a lot is yoga (Ik but it’s a meme cuz it’s true) just cuz forcing yourself to push your body then rest feels soooo good. Here are some good free classes I like that range in all levels of difficulties (https://www.corepoweryogaondemand.com/keep-up-your-practice). Trying calling friends too! I hate having friends see me down so calling makes me fake it until I make it and really feel better"

Louisvuitton,fmyag4e,t1_fmyacb1,1586481647.0,Yeah good luck! Make sure to be logged into an account too and to have your credit card and shipping address all in. I couldn’t find a way to add it in so I went through all the steps of ordering something in stock and then didn’t place the order so I could save the info
Louisvuitton,fmy9pre,t1_fmy9je3,1586481181.0,Thanks!
Louisvuitton,fmy9p6s,t1_fmy7qri,1586481171.0,"Yeah unfortunately I had a tab open watching it while I did other work. I noticed they mostly restocked around noon-12:30ish on weekdays, tho sometimes earlier or later so maybe try looking around then if you can!"
Louisvuitton,fmy9l6n,t3_fy3ls3,1586481100.0,"Pro tip for anyone else trying to get one, I saw them restocking weekdays between like 11-1 and I got it in my cart like 3 times that way before I finally got it"
