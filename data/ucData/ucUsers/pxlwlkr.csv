Just released a new album to make you dance and cry in your room alone to! Been working on it for the past 2 years, it's a mix of chill, fun, sad, synthpop and dancey music. It's also my first album that features my vocals heavily! Any feedback would be awesome and if you have any questions on sounds and arrangement, ask away <3"
