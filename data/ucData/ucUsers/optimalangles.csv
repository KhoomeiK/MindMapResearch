ucla,fnwuq1b,t1_fnwppdm,1587325824.0,"i hear what you’re saying - i agree. perhaps the part i want to emphasize is Corbin motivates you to study, but studying is different from practicing. you need to know where all the equations and concepts come from, but if it gets to the point where that overcomes the part where you actually practice what you learn (which from my experience is what has happened) then it’s not a great class.

classes that give you challenging problems and make you explain everything to yourself accomplish exactly what Corbins class would, and more. it’s not a “plug and chug” issue. being able to use numbers in physics doesn’t imply what you’re plugging numbers into is mindless and simple."

ucla,fnwj1bd,t3_g406d5,1587319309.0,please. you can replace that with any class. #uclaishard

ucla,flovjwr,t3_fpx6le,1585346361.0,"check the website to be sure. but get a B- or higher in CS 31, 32, and 33. also do CS 1 your first quarter. to switch into CS from undeclared engineering requires a 2.70 GPA in prep courses as well as the previous grade requirements. to switch into engineering from L&S requires a 3.50 GPA. also realize that you can do aerospace engineering with a tech breadth in cs which requires you do finish CS 31 and 32 (and possibly 33??). CS 32 is the single most important class in working in the software industry."
