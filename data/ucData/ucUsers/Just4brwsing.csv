berkeley,foxkroz,t1_foxdmpn,1588147116.0,How is the final formatted? I keep seeing stuff about multiple parts.
berkeley,fotcg2v,t1_fot59kv,1588049997.0,Law school exams etc are much more important and should be studied for much more than say a midterm in a CS class. Routinely studying this much is overkill for a lot of people I think and has diminishing returns quickly.
berkeley,fosdsvm,t3_g9avi4,1588028746.0,This is super dependent on who you are as a student.
berkeley,fnwla95,t3_g3z01u,1587320555.0,Are you selling any of these?! They’re amazing!
berkeley,fnblx38,t1_fnblap0,1586817879.0,"Depends on your programming experience imo, I didn’t have a partner."
berkeley,fmvhh67,t3_fxm34k,1586417146.0,You can take intro classes first that don’t count towards the cap such as CS10 or Data 8.
berkeley,fmv6mem,t1_fmv4f89,1586407468.0,"I took it last summer in addition to a 20 hour commitment. I didn’t think it was too fast paced for me, although I made the mistake of being too overconfident and ended up with an A-. The summer staff were great and I thought it was really reasonable, not too much work. The homework assignments on gradescope are annoying (lots of many part multiple choice questions). 

I really am not interested in that kind of lower level programming but the course staff made it interesting and I I thought that the topics they presented lived up to the course name: “Great Ideas in Computer Architecture”."
berkeley,fmsqr7g,t3_fx48zj,1586360488.0,Not that bad!
berkeley,fmh1xcx,t1_fmh1g8f,1586064149.0,Any areas in particular?
