Devils, given their lawful nature, are the most reliable when it comes to making deals with creatures. They will *never* void deals unless their contracts allow them to do so through some loophole. Alternatively, you could go Celestial, which is also the healer warlock mechanically.

Yes. Hexblade would be the best warlock option here.

Also, complete frankness here just in case you decide to ~~apply~~ make for games with strangers:

* Keeping the tl;dr at the top is smart and I wish more people did this instead of putting it at the bottom.

* Your character concepts should be described in such a way that you need a bunch of text to explain it. I sort of got lost/confused after the sentence talking about the apprenticeship to the hedge wizard. Either use things from popular media that most people would get or provide hyperlinks (this latter part is more for online games). *This still stands whether one is a player or a DM.*

* Would recommend on familiarizing yourself with the [""Knife theory.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/775caq/my_friends_and_i_have_something_called_knife/)

As a DM, I have a policy of limiting backstories to the amount of text that can fit on one page in standard 12-sized font. My justification being that, if I were to meet a character on the street, I should be able to get the gist of their character within 5-10 minutes of conversation. As the game progresses, I encourage players to add to their backstories as they become more familiar with their characters. *This last section, at least for me, also helps me keep track of the story as it's a lot of effort to have overstuffed backstories for characters that the PCs will either never meet or will never talk to for a significant enough amount of time.*

Any successful attacks against you while in that state increase Dying by 1; crits increase it by 2."
Pathfinder2e,fo2y5kd,t1_fnt9jyw,1587476784.0,Would recommend Dedication into a martial class such as Fighter or Monk.
Pathfinder2e,fo2xukt,t3_g5eul7,1587476595.0,"In my experience, starting new players at level 1 is almost always a good idea since they don't know how to play.

If the players are fairly experienced with TRPGs, starting them off at level 2-3 isn't bad as they and GMs have more options to throw at each other."

Pathfinder2e,fo2x4p9,t3_g5dm06,1587476151.0,"Depends on the injuries

* Bleed/Piercing/Slashing = cauterization, bandage/gauze, or tourniquet (last resort IRL)

* Bludgeoning = bone reduction or emergency splint

* Acid = water, complementary acid/base

* Cold = warm compress

* Electricity = insulating material

* Fire = cold compress

* Mental = shaking someone out of it

* Poison = Activated charcoal + emetics (poisons); most of what you see in movies with regards to venom are [***bad***](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15647-snake-bites/management-and-treatment). Venom treatment involves staying still and praying someone finds you in time to administer antivenom.

* Negative/Positive = ? un/holy water

* Sonic = ? snapping / tuning fork at ear

* Alignment = ? contact with materials of opposite alignment to damage"
Pathfinder2e,fo2vklg,t1_fo2u4ww,1587475134.0,Check again. It has the trait.
Pathfinder2e,fo2vgaz,t1_fo2ph33,1587475054.0,"How supported would you say PF2 to is right now on Foundry compared to Roll20?

Also, I'm almost done with Extinction Curse Book 1; how much work am I looking at with setting up the players' sheets, the monsters, and the maps?"
Pathfinder2e,fo2nrlr,t3_g51b4x,1587469079.0,"I think there's a thing in the GMG about getting free deidcation feats, but I think you get them at the appropriate levels only."
Pathfinder2e,fo2lq0b,t3_g58snt,1587467098.0,Urge. To buy. Foundry. ***Growing***.
dndnext,fo1salz,t3_g53cby,1587440336.0,"Man, that ain't unethical, that's just smart. However, I would like to add that the DMs should be *good* DMs.

I have a player who is nice to play with at best and infuriatingly intolerable with how he wants to avoid consequences and then gets butthurt IRL if I/players punish him for it. His inability to take criticism extends to his DMing."
