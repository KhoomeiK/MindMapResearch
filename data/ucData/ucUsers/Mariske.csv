DesignMyRoom,fpagif1,t3_gc4t96,1588447691.0,"I LOVE that wall and I'm not usually a fan of feature walls. What a beautiful apartment!
I would be tempted to put a desk layout against that wall all the way across and have your couch grouping be near the big window. Would you need a dining area? If so, that could be a bench in an L shape under the small window and against the wall.
For the seating area, light grey wool rugs are in and would draw from the floors and that feature wall. Plus wool is very stain resistant. I would put any entertainment/tv stuff against the empty wall and couch either below the window or opposite the window depending on space/radiator. You could put a fun chair opposite the couch. To do Scandinavian, you could get a blonde wood chair and dress it up with a fur blanket or chunky sweater blanket. To do mid century, switch the wood to teak or walnut and pick a muted fabric but include fun pillows with texture.

trashy,fpaamsi,t1_fpa9q29,1588444211.0,I think it‚Äôs the most common implant complication; it happens when the body rejects the implant so it forms a capsule of scar tissue (I believe) around the implant in an attempt to wall of the foreign object from the rest of the body. The result is it looks like your boobs are balloons hanging on your chest rather than that they look natural.

I'm so glad to see you're taking such good care of it :) 
When I was little, the doors opened but it was always a struggle. We made sure to open them every so often to keep them from sticking. My thought would be turning them around so the bowing faces outward away from each other, but I can't think of anything beyond that. I'm just impressed you got them off that metal track!"

Fallout,fndw9ql,t1_fnctulv,1586878667.0,"Yes I've spent DAYS of my life just designing and building structures and then furnishing them, then seeing how the settlers populate the space. I love the idea of a settlement you design and grow. What else am I going to do with all the crap I compulsively collect in the Commonwealth? I think there are plenty of established areas to explore and scavenge and the settlements are a great bonus. Also, the mods I've downloaded have largely been more settlements I can customize. I didn't expect ""the Sims"" in fo4 but it was a happy surprise given how much time I've found myself pouring into it."
