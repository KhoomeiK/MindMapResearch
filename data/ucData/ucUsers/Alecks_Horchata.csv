Also, op keep in mind that falkirk is like a 1 minute further walk down the same exact street as falkirk, which is pretty nice from my experience"
ucr,fo7g7aa,t1_fo74n8h,1587577793.0,Edited my comment to talk about BB... I would try and splurge on nicer housing if u can fit into your budget...
ucr,fo6s1g3,t3_g5tp69,1587565620.0,"Plaza singles looked nice inside if u want to live alone. I know I guy who was very happy with falkirk for the most part, just try to take the 2nd floor. Stone haven sounded small from people’s experience. Glen Mor is the nicest and most convenient and also the most expensive. 

Personally I preferred off campus from the get go, and I would recommend as long as u can find some solid roommates.

Engineering wouldn’t have a lot to do with that’ll where ur living unless you’re a first year in which case I would recommend the edgenuity LLC

As for tips, I recommend thorough checks before you move your stuff in and record anything that looks at all ‘fixable’ in case they try to charge you for it when you move out. 

And try to find somewhere less than 2 mi from campus bc there are constant problems with parking so you can’t rely on that.

Edit: 
Not sure on pricing on most of the apartments but I wouldn’t go to bannockburn unless I could get a single. It’s really cramped and feels more like a large motel room than an apartment. The rooms don’t have actual solid doors. In the triple, 2 people get to share a small room with a paper thin sliding door and the third bloke is stuck in a doorless LOFT where their only privacy is a hip-height wall and being upstairs (that loft is adjacent to the living room area btw). Also kitchen is small. 

Maybe this is just one layout of several, so make sure to do the virtual tours, I never lived there personally so take it with a grain of salt."

Also tons of great trails around, which I didn’t find out, and really got me back into running. Idk if that’s a common attraction tho."

ucr,fm5mk3d,t3_ft54yt,1585775769.0,"Idk if piazza is free, but more professors should be using it or something similar this quarter. Answering questions during lecture in zoom is going to be quite difficult for many classes. 

Zoom as a platform isn’t designed for this and imo looks like an opportunistic company trying to get more market share in a time of crisis. Idc why they’re doing it tho, all I know is that I won’t be using zoom outside of school EVER in its current state"
