starcitizen_refunds,fpdp5zs,t3_gcexjg,1588531429.0,This sub is gradually transform into my favorite anthropology seminar for specie observation.

HistoryMemes,fnq7b3v,t3_g2y8np,1587159057.0,"There is a surge of Nordic memes on this sub recently, and I don’t know why."

StupidFood,fnlx7rk,t1_fnkjcqf,1587061306.0,That sounds r/oddlyspecific.
WaitWhat,fnisiah,t3_g1h7v8,1586985593.0,"So the logical extension would be you are not your brain, least not metaphysically, which can magically explain things like depression and anxiety, which are occasions that you told your brain to go one way, but your brain told your body otherwise."
StupidFood,fnirty0,t3_g1zlh4,1586985254.0,r/sorrynosalad sounds like a legit subreddit name that has huge potential.
sadcringe,fn629mr,t1_fn4owys,1586684599.0,">a TV stereotypical high school lunch hall on steroids. 

That’s absolutely a r/BrandNewSentence"
oddlysatisfying,fn4nb1c,t3_fz9a97,1586644896.0,"Nice, now you have to resharpen it."
ucr,fn4kn61,t3_fzge8u,1586643324.0,It seems to be something that will go straight to deduct the tuition instead of actually handing out money? Of course I might be wrong.
starcitizen_refunds,fn2jsuy,t3_fyfvi5,1586591616.0,"Glad you finally see this problem of lack of originality. It can’t be more obvious if you had a chance to actually watch CR’s movie. The moment I saw that movie, I know there’s no hope. Figure it would help you trim down this essay. In short words: all these behaviors are chronic and habitual."
FuckYouKaren,fmz3lqx,t1_fmyps65,1586505092.0,"The worst thing of this matter is now you know you are living in the same neighborhood with this particular person, and probably can even figure out which house. 

But you can’t just knock on her door and talk, because then she will make sure you got **REPORTED** again for stalking and harassing."
anno,fmu7zfg,t3_fx4x8e,1586386266.0,More like the Les Invalides.
Instantregret,fmpaftq,t1_fmnluni,1586277374.0,I see Bruce Willis enjoying some family time.
Rainbow6,fmlrc1b,t1_fmks1op,1586191796.0,"I think it can be perfectly calculated since most of the gadget usage in the game have already been counting towards your match score. You got +2 points for hitting even a bob-wire. 
Just because its hard doesn’t mean there is no way to get it done. 

But I thank you for bringing an interesting discussion to this chain. I’d say all of us in this chain did a far better job on this topic than most of the comments above this chain."
Rainbow6,fmkrm12,t1_fmkre1j,1586165914.0,"You help your team by not quitting, by using gadgets, by generate kills, by callouts. I don’t think my rough idea above implies that I’m in favor of one man army. But yeah, it’s a teamgame."
Rainbow6,fmkq56y,t1_fmkpm5n,1586164243.0,"Yeah, I’m not sure either. Im in general satisfied with the current system since the match environment is serious enough. As a quasi-professional mode, it has already accomplished its intended function."
Rainbow6,fmkp5n9,t3_fvv8ah,1586163133.0,"Honestly, an alternative would be putting more weight on individual K/D and gadget utility, and intelligently putting lesser weight on W/L based on team strength including # of players in the match. Together putting these into an algorithm to determine rank progression individually."
seiyuu,fmirzm2,t1_fmifgv8,1586115721.0,"I think the survey also failed to consider those actors and voice actors that do not work under one of Actor Union’s member management offices. I’m not sure for the actors but only a handful of Seiyuu managements, usually the larger ones with longer history, are members of the actor union. Most of the small newly founded managements are therefore excluded. But it is especially those Seiyuu who are working for the small management firms or freelance would take more severe impact.

So, it definitely could get worse. And the situation will be compounded considering that many young Seiyuu are freshly out of high school, went to Tokyo with little family support (jōkyō), and might not have enough financial knowledge to perceive the impact in the long run."
