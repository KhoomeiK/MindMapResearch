UCSC,fnkb9m0,t3_g27pj8,1587020802.0,"hi, i'm like you i transferred here last fall as junior, graduated high school a while ago. one of the classes i highly recommend is ""communicating anthropology"" with megan moodie. it's a good course that introduces you basically to university level anthropological study, focusing on culture. really opened up my eyes to what anthropology is at this level as far as philosophy and practice. professor was a self-described ""experimental ethnographer"" meaning that she was very open to innovation and experimentation in the field, which was cool to me. other cultural classes i took were good too, and the course offerings are exciting (at least for me) every quarter. my professor for latin american ethnographies was a very good man who was very knowledgeable on the subject. he was the ""chair of field studies"" or something like that and mentioned to those who were interested to let him know.

since i'm more interested in going on digs, i took skeletal biology last quarter. we have a good bone lab and i guess we're one of the few schools that has real human remains instead of casts which i thought was cool. the grad student who taught it is an active archaeologist with research done in peru. there's also a class i wanted but couldn't get because of scheduling where they literally take you out every week to dig i guess.

my point is, the faculty in the anthro department have all been good experiences for me. it's a smaller department than others on campus so it feels much more intimate. they're caring, and all seem to be passionate about the subjects they teach. the department advisor is also really cool, and she doesn't make you feel like you're wasting her time like some other advisors do. if you really allow yourself to build relationships with members of the faculty, it'll pay off i think. especially whichever professor seems like they're in a field you care about. on the first day of fall the entire department has a lil welcoming party where all the faculty introduce themselves and the research they are involved in and man it dope to hear the work they're doing. i recommend it here for sure. not competitive, and not nearly as ""institutionalized"" as i was afraid it would be. the culture within the department is the bees knees.

if you have any other questions let me know"
