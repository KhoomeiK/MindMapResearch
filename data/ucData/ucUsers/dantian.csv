It can be really easy/tempting to buy into stuff like that so it's really important to focus on the truth. Personally I think Bernie rocks, Biden sucks, but in this video he was not falling asleep. Something about ""not stooping to their level"" and all that."
UCSantaBarbara,fovh0nw,t3_g9ff9r,1588101170.0,What do you think the big tarp contraption is for? The window? Seems pretty inventive. Maybe inside curtains aren't an option.
videos,fotb8wl,t1_fot7mvy,1588049089.0,Hey that was fantastic. Super insightful and well thought out. I like the way you write.
electronicmusic,fo5cssr,t1_fo4cblz,1587522589.0,No way!!! Nero was my all time favorite group back in the day and I've been so bummed since they've been gone. I just started listening to some Joseph Ray and I can absolutely hear it. So glad he's still doing stuff.
electronicmusic,fo5chzs,t3_g5hnyu,1587522387.0,"Hey!

I have had many an intimate, emotional moment with your music as a soundtrack and for that I am extremely grateful. It really helps me to get in touch with a deeper, softer place within myself and have a cathartic & emotional yet peaceful experience.

My question is: I'm not an expert on your music but it seems like a lot of it is more chill, laid back, & emotional. A lot of the electronic music scene is based around dancing. Do you aim to create a ""danceable"" set? Do you face any difficulties of this with the nature of your music? Also, do you have any difficulties marketing your live experience to people?

Hope you get the chance to respond!

Much love,

Trevor

P.S. I have definitely cried listening to your Life Sized Ghost remix and that was a major soundtrack to my highschool years."

politics,fmupww6,t1_fmu8i3s,1586396345.0,I disagree as I think Trump is the most dangerous president at least in modern history and absolutely needs to be stopped. But I do get where you're coming from and respect your right to vote/not vote based on what you feel is right.
TechnoProduction,fmtyuwz,t1_fmhf9c3,1586381456.0,That's unfortunate - well keep spreading the vibe and I will as well and perhaps more and more opportunities will start to develop :)
politics,fmtyplv,t1_fmt4e2p,1586381379.0,"Yeah I suppose that's true but I feel like still would be better than a term 2 trump who has absolutely nothing to lose and makes no efforts to make any kind of concessions whatsoever. 

This bipartisan system is so fucked because I feel like progressives & democratic socialists and other groups have the numbers to form a party that would be equal in size to the remaining democratic party but would put the right at such an unreasonable advantage that we would always lose. I feel like I share very few values with the Democratic party and that they are as corrupt as the Republican party, but overall the DNC is less cultish and has beliefs that are less harmful and would do less damage in power."
politics,fmty3xi,t1_fmt7xtc,1586381070.0,"I guess you do have a good point - CA is going to Biden no matter what. I live in CA as well. I would urge anybody to vote for Biden bc to be honest Trump poses such a huge threat, especially to the most vulnerable Americans who Bernie is fighting for every single day. Voting for Biden is the lesser of two evils, which is not compelling and honestly so disheartening but it would be helping to stop something far worse."
politics,fmtxnb2,t1_fmt43b0,1586380833.0,"I can definitely agree with you on that. I think Joe is a piece of garbage too, and I don't feel any ties to the democratic party as well. The ""vote blue no matter who"" does not resonate with me whatsoever and I would not campaign for him but I will vote for him to stop somebody Trump who is a complete monster and whose actions have directly caused the deaths of thousands of Americans in this current crisis. Voting Joe would mean stopping trump and would move us even 1% closer to addressing climate change, raising minimum wage, erasing student debt etc. The lesser of two evils is never compelling but Trump is a big fucking evil and 4 more years would be super fucking bad."
politics,fmt3u3p,t1_fmt2whx,1586366430.0,Please reconsider.
politics,fmt3qt6,t1_fmt2wny,1586366387.0,"The unfortunate part is that Trump's actions do not affect the DNC and their billionaire sponsors as much as they affect the underprivileged, the undocumented, and the most vulnerable people in our society. Please don't sit out the election to spite people who ultimately are mostly protected from Trump's regime. Please help us to stop him from creating more suffering for those who already have to suffer the most."
politics,fmt3f16,t1_fmt2wnp,1586366237.0,Ditto
politics,fmt39yp,t1_fmt2xxi,1586366173.0,"That's a good perspective to have, although if Trump is allowed to stay in power it will have a direct negative effect on many people's lives (even if it is not our own). Voting against him could be helping lots of people."
politics,fmt35l6,t1_fmt2ym9,1586366117.0,Please vote for Biden. I'm a diehard Bernie supporter. It's super depressing but we have to stop this dude and we need everybody's support. He's directly responsible the deaths of thousands of people.

Hey friends, here's a melodic house/techno tune I'm working. I don't necessarily have any specific elements I'd like feedback on but overall would appreciate a second set of ears so any perspective is much appreciated :)"
