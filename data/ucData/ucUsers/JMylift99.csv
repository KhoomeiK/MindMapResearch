climate,forvqfr,t1_forv3b9,1588019351.0,"Honestly any university really, but if you can research universities would be your best bet as they are focused on research (as the name suggests haha). Some I know for sure that are research universities are all of the UC schools."
climate,fortncn,t3_g96yda,1588018311.0,"This might not be exactly what you're looking for, but University department websites especially for the ecology and environmental science/studies departments have good resources to current issues. If you look enough you can find scientific papers and newsletters surrounding new studies regarding environmentalism and ecology."

UCSC,fniyee4,t3_g1z0k5,1586988584.0,so is no one going to point out why the professor is blue??? or is it just me...
UCSC,fnfek8l,t1_fnezi8o,1586906555.0,"This right here. I completely agree, some things to add and emphasize, it's what you make of it and take advantage of all the opportunities they provide. The EEB and ENVS departments have so many internships and field courses to apply your learning into the field, especially with the campus being so closely tied with natural spaces. Also going off the coastal science campus (right on the coast btw), it is a struggle both getting there and scheduling classes in sync with the main campus. 

A tip I could give, the first two years are going to be gen ed courses, but the internships (especially the ones provided by ENVS) are open to anyone so definitely apply to an internship! It also allows you to make connections early on and it's a nice break from the traditional classroom. 

As for the college question, each college has a theme (and unofficial stereotypes) which you choose based on your personal preference, though with that in mind each college tends to have some majority of a major. Correct me if I'm wrong but Porter (not including transfer community) has a lot of art based majors, RCC consists of more environmental/ natural sciences and so on. But I would read each description and choose your college preference based on what community you want to be apart of. 

But yeah, cherry said it perfectly, and I would personally recommend EEB, but it's what you make of it. 

Good luck in your decision process!"
UCSC,fmqlo0u,t3_fwmk29,1586302065.0,"I actually transferred from UCR to UCSC so kinda the opposite from you. And I transferred in with a 3.6 GPA and got into SD, and Davis as well. I think a large part of being accepted was really with the essays (you have to write the essay questions again) and just being genuine about why you want to transfer whether it be seeing yourself succeed in that other UC. I'm going to go against the general consensus that transferring is hard from one UC to another, cuz frankly I was always told it was easier haha. (with that in mind I applied with the transfer application so I don't know if there was a special application for UC to UC transfers)

 Just see it as any other college application and don't forget to add any extracurricular activities you did at UCSC, everything helps. And keep communications with you advisers, especially since they will help you with the process and leaving the school as smoothly as possible. And I think someone already mentioned, make sure you have your pre-recs completed, since you'll probably go straight into major classes. 

Going back to the application process, (I'm sure you already know) there is an extra question for transfers, so keep that in mind in writing you essays. 

Good Luck!"
