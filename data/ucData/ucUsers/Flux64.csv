makinghiphop,fpmyckt,t1_fpmxxlx,1588744944.0,"Sick beat. Love the drum pattern, itâ€™s something new and the whole beat has a really nice dark vibe to it. Only thing I would change is maybe the snare choice, I feel like something that sounds more like a snare drum would sound better. Great work!"
makinghiphop,fpmxnkm,t1_fpmqi6p,1588744416.0,"This is heat. Definitely could see this on jackboys. I love the dark vibe and nasty drum/808 pattern and the hi-hat roll into the snare. Honestly nothing I would really change about this.

makinghiphop,fpmxf0a,t1_fpmqu3y,1588744249.0,"Cool beat! I like the looping synth pattern. Only thing I would suggest is maybe making another melody on top of the synths so you can develop the main pattern more. Makes the beat a little more interesting. Mix is clean!

makinghiphop,fmo7iwi,t1_fmmw1mn,1586248296.0,"Your 808s are a little muffled. I would go for a harsher 808 with more high-end. Another thing is that this beat doesn't really have any melodic cohesiveness, the 808 pitches don't really match the melody. good mix tho! great work"
makinghiphop,fmo7g1p,t1_fmmy1qj,1586248209.0,"nice delivery, nice bars. I'm not really good at giving feedback on vocals, but they're mixed well! thanks for the feedback!"
makinghiphop,fmo7ddp,t1_fmn5kby,1586248126.0,"thanks for the feedback!

I'm loving the little blip sounds you have here, and the kick pattern has a nice bounce to it. The whole 8-bit vibe is executed really well here, great job! Only thing I would say is maybe mix the snare a little higher."
makinghiphop,fmmsmek,t1_fmmp3qc,1586211290.0,"This beat is crazy dude, I absolutely LOVE the little bridge/interlude parts you have going on, they create such a nice vibe and make the song flow so well. I could see a story being spat out on this beat. Nice sample, normally I would suggest adding some more percussion to fill the space, but I don't think this beat needs that! Only thing I would change is maybe the snare selection, the snare in the bridge parts don't really fit. Amazing beat tho!
