UCSD,fo1pk6m,t3_g3xpkk,1587438513.0,"Yes. Although I have struggled with depression since puberty (tldr was diagnosed with ptsd in high school, had a journey of therapists but never really helped), staying busy and constantly preoccupied during the quarters allowed me to distract myself and not feel the depression as much. I was always social, in a lot of orgs, working multiple jobs, and keeping my grades up. It was always there, and I would occasionally have episodes, but not unbearable.

Now, I feel terrible. I graduated in March, so I have nothing to do rn. I can't get home, and my plans have all fallen through. I wake up and feel hopeful about the day, but by noon I'm depressed because I realize despite being dressed and ready to do something, I have nothing to do. I'll eventually pull myself out of it and get semi productive in the evenings, but then I end up staying up too late. Instead of having occasional depressive episodes, its every single day going through this cycle. It's honestly a struggle even getting dressed and out of bed. I personally find the occasional Zoom calls draining, because it feels like I have to be ""on"". Most of all, I feel so angry that people like us are complying with social distancing and staying inside, at the expense of our mental health, yet people protesting and not complying may keep us inside so much longer.

You're not alone. Try not to spend a ton of time on screens (for me, that makes me feel worse). Take a 10 min walk, even if its in your pajamas. The other day, I decided to dress up as if I was going to work. Find little things you appreciate and try to make a routine out of them."
UCSD,fo1o972,t3_g54g32,1587437672.0,"I am not a transfer student or in the life sciences, but I am going straight from undergrad to UCLA this fall. Don't underestimate the power of a good LOR from a work supervisor. I had 2 professors that I was close with in my major, but I needed a 3rd. My boss from my campus job with HDH since freshman year wrote me a really nice letter, and I think it helped portray me as well rounded. If you think they can speak to your work ethic, loyalty, and other relevant skills, don't write them off just because they aren't a prof. Also, my major required a capstone, and I ended up getting an A+ in it both quarters. I hadn't thought to ask my prof for that class since I barely knew them (never had a class together) and they told me they were surprised I hadn't asked them! TLDR: it can never hurt to ask. Just make sure you give them ample time (September if due December), and send them periodic reminders and all the materials they may need (CVs, schools + deadlines, draft essays)."
UCSD,fo1nq1k,t1_fo0se3j,1587437325.0,They have to be enrolled or Rec members. Total ripoff.
ucla,fn4o8zc,t1_fn4ny84,1586645446.0,"Thank you for the great advice! Do you have any insight on what the average commute time via bus is coming from further east (along Wilshire/east towards K-town) going to UCLA? Additionally, if you don't mind my asking, what's your housing situation in Westwood? Do you have roommates?"
UCSD,fkr9y4v,t1_fkr6i22,1584464694.0,"Well, I applaud your Department for allowing students that option, because in my department students and staff are not given a choice at the moment.

Don't you think there are other people suffering besides you? I too am struggling to make rent this month and am terrified about the likely lack of income to come for the next few months.  Your attitude that it is unfair that supervisors and administrators are taking preventative measures and requiring people to take time off is coming from a place of privilege! I have an autoimmune condition and am still required to report to work with my department. My coworkers, both students and full time staff, aren't given the option to choose what is best for their health. They now risk exposing their families and friends who are vulnerable.

With all due respect, my $13/hr job that I depend on too to make ends meet should not put my health at risk.

Take your frustrations out at the university for not having the proper financial support systems in place for its workers and on the system as a whole for not allowing you to get paid time off. Speak up and ensure that you are being given equal opportunity to telecommute. Perhaps (although I agree that this is extremely hard to do on a limited budget and I too having barely enough to get by) adjust your living expenses and evaluate finding a better job that allows you to be semi prepared for an emergency like this and better respects its staff."
