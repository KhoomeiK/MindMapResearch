harrypotter,fplal2h,t1_fplady2,1588709283.0,Really? It’s stupid to hate Hitler? I think you need to re-evaluate your values and your morals. Hating something doesn’t make it ‘fairy land’
harrypotter,fpla2g1,t1_fpl9vvj,1588709022.0,Ya the discussion ends because suddenly you realize I just gave you a real life example of how someone can do good and bad and you can recognize that but still hate that person.
harrypotter,fpl9oz0,t1_fpl99ep,1588708829.0,"I’m saying that you can RECOGNIZE someone did good and bad and still say ‘no even with the good, his bad was worse. Thus I don’t like him’. Like oh look Hitler outlawed animal testing and helped in cancer research, but he still murdered thousands of people and held them in camps. Are we not allowed to hate him because of the fact that his bad overrules the good? Maybe you should stop insulting people as a form of argument."
harrypotter,fpl96k3,t1_fpl9177,1588708575.0,I thought you said goodbye. My statement makes sense. Get out of here with your bullshit toxic conversation skills
harrypotter,fpl8ydm,t1_fpl8u4v,1588708464.0,Lol okay you are clearly childish and don’t understand that this is a discussion meaning people won’t always agree with you. Grow up
harrypotter,fpl8r8r,t1_fpl8h0w,1588708365.0,Okay... and I’m saying that your statement that ‘people who hate on snake see the world in black in white’ is wrong because people are able to recognize that he did good and bad things but choose to hate him because they believe that his good doesn’t overrule the bad. You can hate him even while recognizing the good he did.
harrypotter,fpl89ca,t3_ge3y4l,1588708117.0,"You can recognize that he is a grey character and still hate him. I look at all the choices he made, some good some bad, and decided that in my opinion that his good did not replace all the bad he did. I think, despite his good deeds, he is a terrible person."
DunderMifflin,fpjsesn,t3_gdv4j8,1588679651.0,Whaaaat the fuck.
harrypotter,fpjs71z,t1_fpjlvt5,1588679467.0,Exactly! It was just super frustrating to read.

harrypotter,fpjgc8s,t3_gdt5pb,1588667452.0,"Hermione really pissed me off in these scenes. Like sure animals have their own minds but as an owner, you are supposed to train them on what behavior is okay and not okay. She didn’t do anything to stop crookshanks."

relationship_advice,fpicgar,t1_fphuiv6,1588638063.0,GIRL KICK HIM OUT. He doesn’t respect you and he’s a complete asshole that doesn’t understand normal bodily functions. And asking you to pay for sheets that you bought?!!?! Wtf!

lost,fpewoz1,t3_gd05li,1588556583.0,"They put him in a leadership role, always looking to him to make decisions. No one was willing to really make any hard decisions but he was. And then, they would get upset when he would lead in a way they didn’t like or made a hard decision. Leaders make tough decisions for the best of everyone, even if everyone is against them."
harrypotter,fpei10b,t1_fpdy0jc,1588547940.0,"Well he does deal with multiple creatures as once. They probably can get rowdy all at the same time and I’m sure Newt would be able to handle throwing out multiple spells he needs to handle them in a very short amount of time. Similarly, he can handle a bunch of aurors."

relationship_advice,fp5y1ec,t3_gbg8dy,1588342328.0,I’m glad you were able to work it out with you gf. Best of luck with the charges
relationship_advice,fp0l4cz,t3_ga85fb,1588211457.0,"I think it’s crazy that people are supporting him. This shows a complete lack of trust. People are saying ‘but you never really know’ but you’re supposed to have trust and expect loyalty. If you don’t trust each other then you have many barriers to get past before thinking about marriage. Asking for a DNA test is saying your SO doesn’t have 100% trust in you being faithful to him.   He may say ‘I trust you but I just need to be sure’. Wtf? It’s so contradictory. If your SO thinks there’s even a chance of cheating, then is you relationship really that strong? Idk man"

relationship_advice,foxxiaq,t3_ga5aru,1588159597.0,"Oh no I’m worried about the fact that you washed them already. It was proof if your BIL were to deny this. Hopefully your husband believes you 100% and you BIL owns up to it bc if not, this could turn out really bad."

relationship_advice,fo6cedo,t1_fo66qzs,1587554530.0,"To say that Islam is misogynistic is islamophobic to me. It seems that you have generalized your own experiences with Muslim men. If you are not Muslim and have never practiced, I don’t think you have the right to say whether is it a misogynistic religion. Your friend has a right to be upset with you saying that you think Islam is misogynistic. You have a right to decide who you date but your views on Islam are insulting."
lost,fo60wek,t3_g5wygq,1587542366.0,No sorry. Apparently he hated shooting in Hawaii and left the show on bad terms.
harrypotter,fo60kzk,t3_g5u5p2,1587542038.0,Lol no thanks. I’ve been seeing her wayyyy to much everywhere and honestly hated her in Shadowhunters. I feel she just doesn’t have the spunk needed to play Ginny
lost,fo5peh6,t1_fo34mq0,1587531676.0,I’m a naturally emotional person but Lost was on a whole other level. I feel like the show has conditioned me to start crying whenever the music plays from when they remember/find each other in the flash sideways
lost,fo5ow0s,t1_fo3iuhh,1587531263.0,Oh wow thank you! I didn’t know about these.
lost,fo29t82,t1_fo23ikh,1587454442.0,"Exactly! Every time one of them found each other, I started crying. I think I cried a minimum of at least 15 times in the last two episodes haha. It made me so happy that they brought pretty much everyone back for the finale"
lost,fo20udz,t1_fo201fr,1587446391.0,"Understandable. I heard many people didn’t like the ending. Personally, I loved it. Though the whole season, I kept thinking the the flash sideways were them in an alternate universe/timeline."
lost,fnymcb2,t3_g4kiue,1587367670.0,Richard. But not just the years following the 815 flight but his whole journey as an advisor.
harrypotter,fnym642,t3_g4jdps,1587367499.0,"It would be great if it was properly executed. Another fandom I’m a part of, the Shadowhunters, has a movie made that was average but not that great. Then it had a tv show made. The casting was pretty spot on but they changed so much shit, I couldn’t keep watching cause it pissed me off. People who watched the show just said they saw it as a sort of fanfic that changed a bunch of things to their preference. So unless the tv show creators, writers, and director are all diehard HP fans, it will likely have large changes and not be that great overall. Also, since tv shows tend to have less money put into development(unless it’s netflix or something), the quality and special effects might not even be that great."
lost,fnv8a0u,t3_g40yhp,1587283704.0,I also started watching right before the quarantine started. Just reached season 6 bc I have so much free time(really more like me choosing to ignore all the hw waiting for me) haha! I’ve loved the whole show so far. Have fun watching😊
