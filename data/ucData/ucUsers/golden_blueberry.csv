I am a student, I got it as my first card, and I absolutely love it and the customer service. The bonus is better than the city bonus (doubling Cashback gives you 10% on rotating categories and 2% everyday not to mention $50 from referral link all vs $25 bonus on citi card). If you want to get thank you points to do fancy transferring with a premium city card in the future, maybe go with Citi.

So if that is your only card and your overall utilization is 70%, then yes, it would have a very very major effect on your score. But if you have 5 credit cards that dilute your utilization to say 20% or less, then the impact on your credit score would still exist but would be far less."

CreditCards,fpe4oz7,t1_fpe476x,1588540286.0,"It doesn’t matter for building credit. Building credit is showing you can manage credit responsibly by having credit cards (or loans, etc) and paying your bills on time always. Utilization is important for your credit score, but it is not average utilization it is utilization for the next month but rather utilization IN that month. In one month if you have 50% utilization, then that will be used in credit score calculations. If the next month it is 0%, then that is what will be used. So basically, your utilization from one month on a credit card will only matter until the next, so paying it off before the end of the cycle is a nice way to inflate a credit score in the short term, but isn’t really important for building it in the long run. 

I hope that long rant made sense, if not let me know."
CreditCards,fpe424n,t1_fpe0tl8,1588539926.0,Oh I think I mis-phrased my sentence. It is if you pay it off before your cycle ends/ you get billed that you avoid increasing your utilization.

My #2 recommendation is don’t take easy classes just to inflate your GPA. The valedictorian at my local high school didn’t get into Berkeley probably because he only took easy classes to boost her GPA, and the admissions department can tell. 

My #3 recommendation is don’t slack off on the essays. They are very important in admission decisions even at large public schools, and starting months ahead of time on them will help make sure they are the best they can be."

Food and dorms are pretty bad, but it is something you get used to pretty quickly and honestly it’s fine. Haas is fairly hard to get into, but it doesn’t really matter because if you are so inclined, you can still do consulting, I-banking, etc with an Econ major—just look at the alumni placements post graduation. However, I can really see how the hospital being across the street would be amazing for premed. What is your gut feeling on that? Honestly the question I would ask yourself is can you see yourself doing 10 years of school to get all the medical stuff done? Do you want to invest that time/ debt into it? If yes, go with Rice and their premed. If no, I would go with CS or Econ/Business at Berkeley.

berkeley,foshted,t1_fosgw6d,1588030983.0,"It really depends on how good you are at Econ. In Econ 1, you learn less overall due to there being less lecture and more discussion.

My point is not to be unsympathetic to those people (I am) or to say that better resources should not be a priority (they should). My point is that most people are able to cope, and stress is not a major issue for them. As far as work load, a lot will depend on your major. Those with strict entry requirements/ competitive programs like CS and Haas may be more stress inducing than say political science or other things. Hopefully other people can speak in more depth about issues with resources provided/ not provided, but if you come to Berkeley chances are you will be fine.

On a final note, most people in the dorms are freshmen with some junior transfers scattered about. Therefore, I would go with the dorms if you are willing to pay for it, are interested in the social experience of residence halls (which was a major hit for me but a miss for many of my friends not on the floor), and don’t mind being in a double. Hope this helps!"
berkeley,fnrbhoi,t1_fnranif,1587184159.0,"TLDR: I would say 13-16 units. 

Many people find 13 for their first term a good way to transition but personally I did 16 and it was totally fine. 13 units is basically three 4 unit classes and a D-Cal basically, and 15-16 units is roughly four classes. My first term I did Gender studies (3 units) Chem 1a (3 units) chem lab (2 units) English R1A (4 units) and Math 1A (4 units). It was a lot but manageable. It really depends where you want to be by the end of freshmen year. I had no idea what I wanted to do so tried a bunch of things and after Freshmen year I settled on Econ/ Haas. But if you are more focused on what you want to do, 13 units isn’t a terrible idea if you want a smoother transition."
berkeley,fnrb3ci,t3_g3fazj,1587183850.0,"1.) As an Econ/ Haas major, I can speak to this. Haas is easy once you get in. Econ is a little bit more challenging, but the Econ department is really great and you cannot do better than Introduction to Econ (Econ 2) with the Romers. For context, Christina Romer was Obama’s top Econ advisor during the financial crisis and they are both excellent teachers (and they are just some of the many amazing teachers in the Econ department) 

2.) You will want to do homework on the weekends. For me on a slightly higher than normal load, I do maybe 3-4 hours per weekend day on an average weekend, so not nothing too bad but it’s something. I have friends who do less on the weekend but stay up late on the weekdays so depends on the type of person you are I guess.

3.) I am from the area and went to high school in SF so wasn’t particularly inclined to go that frequently. It is about 30 minutes by BART to downtown sf, so very doable if you want and my roomate went clubbing there so definitely possible. However, I found that most people did not go into the city all that much but up to you of course. 

4.) I am not a partier but most of my friends are. You will be hard pressed to find something on Sun-Wed nights unless you are in some areas of Greek life, but Thur-Sat nights there is a lot going on on Frat row and many clubs and orgs have stuff of their own going. If you want to party, you will be able to figure it out like my friends did but it’s not rly my thing so I don’t know details.

5.) Personally, I thought it was going to be really competitive but it’s not (at least in the classes I have been in). Most people want to work together in classes, and many of my friends I have made through collaborating in class. There are some classes/ departments with high GPA cutoffs (like CS and Haas) where people can get more competitive to make the cut, but by and large and outside of those really icky classes (CS 61A, CS 70, UGBA 10, etc) people are much more collaborative than I think Berkeley has a reputation for. And even in those classes, I would say many to most will want to collaborate. It has never been a problem for me and I love collaborating. 

I hope this helped! Feel free to ask any follow ups"

However, if you look for Berkeley’s senior surveys, you can see the companies and job titles of people who graduated with Applied Math by graduation year, how much they earn, and what percentage found employment/ are still looking. I have it linked here: [Senior Survey](https://career.berkeley.edu/survey/survey)"
berkeley,fnr9n47,t1_fnr9c2s,1587182765.0,"I concur with the looking at the requirements. For your Freshmen year w/ MCB or other science I would aim to take one of your classes w/ a lab each term, finish your reading and comprehension requirements, complete two breaths, and then finish the math 1 series. Any leftover slots you can fill with other requirements for your major. Hope this helps somewhat!"
berkeley,fnqw6mi,t1_fnqkb2z,1587173560.0,Ok thank you very much! I have had pretty challenging schedules for my time at Berkeley so far so as long as it’s not particularly bad I’m thinking I am going to go through with it. Thanks for the info!
berkeley,fnqvzqp,t1_fnqbes9,1587173450.0,Yeah I’m solid on math but no math genius by any means. I am trying to take the 101 series/ 141 by the end of sophomore year which means a lot of math cramming most likely....
berkeley,fnqvurc,t3_g3evnz,1587173363.0,"I am not well versed in the requirements of those majors. However I was looking into double majoring and minoring for a while and, while it was doable, it would have required some 18-20 unit terms without summer classes (I was looking at Econ/PolSci major and data science minor). Maybe the requirements are less for what you are looking at, taking summer classes would help, and if you have a lot of AP credits you can skip some of the introductory classes I did. If you do decide to do it, I would recommend planning each of your class slots for each term in a four year planner very carefully to optimize all that you can."
