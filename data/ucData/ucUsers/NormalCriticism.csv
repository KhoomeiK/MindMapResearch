freenas,fpkkgtf,t1_fpkgij3,1588696287.0,"Do you mean just adding a directory under the iocage directory for the jail? This would be similar to copying an entire iocage directory into a new one, right?

&#x200B;

What is the current FreeNAS bug report website? I feel like this is just a bug. All it needs to do is time out and offer to install from a cached version."
Thailand,fpk3zzm,t1_fpjsnta,1588687533.0,The black truck looks like it is full of stuff. It looks heavy. The empty truck that tried passing the black truck at the last second didn't check to see that there was already someone passing and caused this.
geologycareers,fp68t4e,t3_gbib04,1588348137.0,Your line about being a geologist making you an excellent weed grower made me laugh. It really makes sense.
PostgreSQL,fp5tcmw,t1_fp54pkj,1588339447.0,"I could stop it if I need to. There are a few dozen users but if I can take care of business quickly then nobody will mind.

A few million rows in the biggest non-spatial data frame.  There are a few tiles of DEM rasters covering a good chunk of California and Oregon.

It is a RDS instance with Amazon. Some services don't seem to work quite as expected. I tried downloading a copy of the database using pgadmin and it failed on permissions even when using the super admin user."
PostgreSQL,fp5spqb,t1_fp51rqw,1588339028.0,It isn't a virtual machine so I haven't figured out a way to do that. It is just a database running on Amazon RDS service.
thinkpad,foyfq7u,t3_ga8lqg,1588171703.0,"Will they start working with Linux developers so they work properly when they ship with Linux? Recent model thinkpads with Linux were such a headache for me.... Poor poor support, trackpad issues. Screen issues."
homelab,fow46hh,t1_fovs331,1588112689.0,Thanks. That helped a bit! It looks like Wireguard is perfectly happy having the same private/public key pair used again and again on the same connection. Can you set multiple [Peer] connections per interface?
homelab,fovqvtf,t1_fovfi3h,1588105963.0,"The only working connection so far is between two servers which both have open ports for the wireguard connection on their public facing routers and both have FQDN mapping to IP addresses. Both servers have reciprocal private/public key pairs.

What would the wg0.conf files look like for the server and mobile device? Can you share your (sanitized) configuration with me?

I feel like I just need to watch or read something explaining how the wireguard topology all fits together. Until I do that I'll just be confused. All I seem to find are either detailed configuration guides that don't explain how and why stuff works or very high level technical documents my the developers."
MachineLearning,fotl0dk,t1_fotdgh6,1588057218.0,I'm not an eye doctor but I have eye problems and most of my family have eye problems. I've seen a lot of these eye images and even trained technicians take awful photos sometimes. They should have trained the AI to deal with that really.
freenas,fotgo7g,t1_for5u78,1588053386.0,I'm not sure why that didn't jump out to me. I did finally get that working. Thank you!
PleX,foqta8c,t1_fooywud,1588000430.0,Can you get two Easystore Western Digital 14TB drives? They are WDRed 14TB drives inside (usually) so they are good if you put them from the USB cases and put them inside your computer case.
freenas,fopqq5u,t1_fopkfdp,1587969100.0,You reminded me that this was a possibility so I tried adding openvpn to this jail. Openvpn is able to make tun connections just fine on the same jail but it still doesn't make them for zerotier... I'll try restarting when I can...
freenas,foi9b6z,t1_foi286f,1587781433.0,What host version are you running? I'm on FreeNAS 11.3. What version of what linux distro are you running? Did you have to install with any special settings?
freenas,fohzpsm,t1_fohkhgz,1587775792.0,I don't know as much about unraid. What is the filesystem support like in unraid? I went with FreeNAS because after reading a fair bit about ZFS I felt it was the most bulletproof file storage out there. Since I started using computers in the early 90s I've never had a catastrophic data loss (like a complete drive loss without a backup) but I've had a ton of file corruption. Drives start to fail or RAID start to show soft uncorrectable errors. ZFS running with ECC just seems to prevent that. I like that.
freenas,fohypry,t1_fohq2hx,1587775247.0,It would be great if you could! I'm pretty confused!
freenas,fohdcri,t1_fohci2d,1587764067.0,That was one of the things I tried. I couldn't even get the system to boot unless I set the drive to virtIO but I didn't notice any difference between setting the NIC as Intel emulated or virtIO.
DataHoarder,fofhftg,t3_ewcg8e,1587735962.0,I recently went through a similar discovery and ended up paying a service called southtree.com. the results were pretty good. They just send you a USB stick with the video files.
homelab,fofg9za,t1_fofdykz,1587735231.0,"At your age lead paint isn't a big health concern. Lead is more of an issue for early childhood brain development. Asbestos does matter to people your age.

Edit: don't go eating lead paint or anything but it isn't the horror at age 20 it was at age 5."
homelab,foelle1,t3_g71fvj,1587707077.0,My off site backup nas is an 8 drive raidz2 of 4tb iron wolf. My home nas is a 4 drive raidz2 of 14tb wd red (easystore). My onsite backup is a single exos x16 16TB external replication target.
homelab,foekw4p,t1_foeg0g1,1587706511.0,"I used 3 of them to saturate a 15,000 square foot home that had no line of sight but thankfully no wireless interference from any other signals in the 2.4 or 5ghz bands. Not even a cordless phone. Technically they had some Bluetooth device that are in the same 2.4 range but I've never heard of that being an interference issue.

Another installation I did with Google WiFi took 5 points for a 2 story 30,000 square ft adobe brick house. It worked eventually but we did a lot of fussing with WiFi point placement. We also hard wired one of the mesh access points on the far end of the house from the main one. 

I also use 3 of them at home in my little 1,200 apartment. I mostly do that because of all the wireless nose. If I could hear my WiFi all I would hear is it screaming over all my neighbors WiFi interference.

And my wife's family home moved to all Google WiFi. 3 access points handle about 7,000 sq ft without a problem.

But honestly, do anything you can to avoid climbing around in the crawlspace and attic of some college rental. If you break an old pvc water pipe it will be your fault. Plus, those old houses have a lot of asbestos. I regret a lot of the crawl spaces I went into when I was younger."
homelab,foe8f59,t3_g6w05r,1587698145.0,"For wireless... Avoid the headache and just fill the house with [Google WiFi](https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/7182840?hl=en). Check the link for how many devices you need. You don't want to waste your time with your room mates knocking on your door at *midnight* saying the internet isn't working in their bedroom and they have an assignment due at *8am* that they haven't started yet and they need *you* to help them make it work.

Why Google Wifi? You don't need to physically connect them together. You just get 5 of them and spread them out throughout the house. They talk to each other. As an added bonus they all function as bridges so if someone has a desktop computer without a wireless card or an old network printer then it will have network access. Don't run your cool homelab gear on it... but it will do a network printer just fine.

Why not use Unifi? I love that gear and I've been paid to build multi-building networks with VoIP, wireless, cameras, storage, etc... and it means you need to maintain it. You should maintain it for a hobby but structure this stuff so your work keeping the home network alive takes no time away from your studies. A fancy Unifi network will distract you and will mean running cables.

As for everything else (Plex and all that), listen to what everyone else here has to say. I suggest you put the ISP point of presence someplace you have control over like your bedroom. You can run everything you want to behind the Google WiFi network and you won't need to deal with your housemates having any issues with anything. Just put all your gear on a nice switch on the forest Google WiFi device and you are home free.

Also, good luck in school!"
DataHoarder,fobepdb,t1_fobc12g,1587659034.0,"The past 6 months have felt like a rollercoaster of CMR, SMR emotions. I feel like yesterday they finally made a statement (my link) that makes it more clear but I wanted someone else to tell me what they think. I assume this conversation impacts more than a few people in this subreddit."
GoogleFi,foau09p,t3_g6mrky,1587652487.0,My pixel 3 is very reliable but I think the 3a has some dual SIM features you may like. I personally like a physical finger print reader so the 4 isn't my jam.
DataHoarder,fo9mapu,t3_g67xtm,1587623758.0,"I recently purchased this exact same drive and for the life of me I can't figure out if it has SMR or CMR or some other nonsense. [And at this point](https://i.imgflip.com/3xrs1m.jpg)

I just want one of the big manufacturers to us what we are buying. I'll buy their drives. That's all I ask."

mullvadvpn,fnu4lmt,t1_fnu22ey,1587254445.0,"iptables is the Linux kernel firewall and I'm running a FreeBSD implementation called FreeNAS. I need to figure out how to run something similar in IPFW. The best I've found follows [something like this](https://mujahidjaleel.blogspot.com/2018/10/how-to-setup-openvpn-client-in-iocage.html) but I don't know if I really need to do it at all. This is a ""best practice"" kind of issue and I'm pretty sure it should work even without this setting turned on.

Edit: Obviously, changing specific details as necessary... but I don't think this should be required at all...

Edit2: Your comments really pushed me to reconsider my assumptions and I was wrong. Surprise. Someone on the internet was wrong. I had to make an IPFW rule like this:

    #!/bin/bash
    # Flush out the list before we begin
    ipfw -q -f flush
    
    # Set rules command prefix
    cmd=""ipfw -q add""
    vpn=""tun0""
    
    # port forwarding for plex
    $cmd 00101 redirect_port tcp 192.168.1.55:32400 9533

Woohoo! Thank you!"
mullvadvpn,fnu1s6k,t1_fntx1bx,1587252876.0,"I think filtered means my connection is going through NAT while open is a direct port. It... Shouldn't (?) make a difference?

UCDavis,fnr2cfn,t1_fnp9jzb,1587177617.0,"The extreme example this quarter is not adapting at all. Holding 100% of the usual assignments, exams, and lectures online but running the lectures over time every day because ""things seem to take longer on zoom""."
UCDavis,fnnwmxc,t1_fnnlkzg,1587104030.0,The ones I know this quarter are almost all doing the minimum of adaptation this quarter. Only one instructor stepped back and really took a big picture view of what the class learning objectives were supposed to be and how to get there given this shitshow.
PleX,fnmglzc,t1_fnmeucd,1587071060.0,"Thanks. PleX runs in a jail under a FreeNAS iocage and all outbound traffic routes through OpenVPN. I guess that means my problem is already solved, right? No need for me to ask for help because clearly I'm not having a problem!"
PleX,fnmfbz1,t1_fnmdngd,1587070405.0,"I would like to prevent PleX and my ISP from knowing what I'm doing over my connection.

I do wonder about port forwarding by the VPN. Do you know of a VPN that offers that? I'm looking for common ones and they don't seem to market that particular service very clearly. I've got Privado."
GooglePixel,fnmavfz,t1_fnlbkb4,1587068127.0,This is almost identical to an iPhone 7. I like the price. I agree with all your points. I definitely think you are right.... But it is basically a 4 year old phone.
vandwellers,fnlcoto,t3_g25aeq,1587051209.0,"Ya know, I don't believe in ghosts, I'm not superstitious, and I'm not religious, but as much as I respect the construction of a nice used ambulance for an RV conversion I'm never going to do it. That gives me the creeps."
engineering,fnar8oy,t3_g0g864,1586802410.0,"Honestly, this is what it felt like the first time I was in a Tesla operating in semi-autopilot (or whatever they call it). It had a cool setting to show the driver when the car could see objects (cars, trucks, lanes, motorcycles) and it was terrifying how often it missed stuff. It missed a semi truck full of trees because it wasn't a normal semi shape and it almost never saw motorcycles splitting lanes until they passed us.

Still.... Cool Legos!"
VietNam,fn9wwey,t3_g0ct85,1586786439.0,I had a really hard time with Phu Quoc. I could tell it was a beautiful island but when I went there it nothing but massive short sighted construction projects. The island had no waste management to speak of so they burned and buried even more trash than usual. Groundwater was was wasted for tourists. The whole place was skipping the most essential infrastructure development in favor of more hotels first. It made me really sad.
Rlanguage,fn91epq,t3_g06te3,1586756283.0,The only reason I use these are to speed up loading some files. Particularly large files from infrequently updated databases. My code automatically checks if the rdata file exists and if it doesn't it runs through the full 30 minute process to download the source data and save the rdata file. Do not depend too heavily of these files but they can be useful sometimes.
geologycareers,fn3bvy8,t1_fn2whzv,1586617492.0,I find most operations faster and more intuitive in QGIS. I also appreciate how much cheaper it is.
