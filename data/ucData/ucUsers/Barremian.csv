UCSD,fpkkxfe,t1_fpkk4l5,1588696524.0,They said it was because of the ocean.  Fuck.
UCSD,fpkkg3r,t1_fpkk2sa,1588696277.0,"What can be done about it?  I felt sick this morning when I woke up and this just gets worse every day.

Edit: nothing, it would seem."
UCSD,fph4vxq,t3_gd5s4k,1588615013.0,Absolutely!  Now excuse me while I spend the next 8 to 12 hours doing homework.
UCSD,fp2oc2m,t3_gayq9r,1588265165.0,"Considering I haven't gone since week 1, no."
UCSD,fox1d4x,t3_g9zmsb,1588131761.0,I've been almost completely alone since last quarter ended.  The only time I interact with people is when I get coffee in the morning and when I go to the store about twice a week.
UCSD,fowebko,t1_foow80t,1588118115.0,Correction: it wasn't that bad.  Now it's like every other CS class.
UCSD,fovrur7,t3_g9tjyw,1588106441.0,"This is beside the point but you want to be a motivational speaker and ""lift people up"" yet you have such little respect for anyone who isn't as ""driven"" as you are to the point that you don't even want to associate with them?  Seems like a bit of a contradiction."
UCSD,for2cep,t1_fopuq2l,1588004975.0,I agree.  It's so nice to have PA's that don't usurp every moment of my life.  This is how all CS classes should be; possible!
UCSD,fopnwl0,t1_fopk1n6,1587966680.0,"QuickNemo+ 
It came with my phone."
UCSD,fop7g2c,t1_fop4a5a,1587954775.0,How the fuck is it week 5 already?
UCSD,foow80t,t1_foow54q,1587947777.0,It isn't but I haven't been taking notes and the midterm in Wednesday so...
UCSD,fnq4oqm,t3_g2vnsy,1587157621.0,I don't know how much longer I can take UCSD...
UCSD,fnp6ikv,t3_g3504i,1587140074.0,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
UCSD,fmdtidc,t3_fuggh2,1585977450.0,I'm already overwhelmed with assignments.  This week has reminded yet again why I hate school.
