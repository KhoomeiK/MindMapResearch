BlackPeopleTwitter,fpmcc8h,t1_fpm45b1,1588730002.0,"> I'm out in California. Community colleges here have something called a ""TAG agreement"" with UC (University of California) schools. You can choose one UC school, follow the instructions/requirements on the TAG agreement, and get guaranteed admission. The TAG is only applicable to certain majors, and it also has GPA requirements, but from what I saw from the agreements, the GPA requirement actually wasn't too unreasonable in most cases.

As a Californian transfer student, you are correct. If you do all the requirements you can very much get into any top university. Ofcourse each university will have their own baseline gpa and extra curricular they would want but in general you meet the requirements to transfer anywhere. People from my community college at San Bernardino Valley college went onto UCLA, Havard, and UCSF, and out of state colleges. As long as you reach the milestones of the two year school you should be fine, the other half if mostly dependent on you like the GPA and extra curricular.

For example, obviously if you're an art major and don't have a decent portfolio no reputable school will take you. In the same sense no top company like Google will hire you if you just have school related work on your resume unless you have a graduates degree."

Not only does the Mixer move free him to make more public appearences without any Twitch involvement, he assigned himself monetary worth so once his Mixer contract is up Twitch will have to offer the same amount bare minimum and as we see with ""banned"" streamers, they get even bigger views on their return."

git clone : Copy a repo to your desktop. Basically it's just copying your project to your desktop. So make a repo(project) on github there should be a copy paste button for your project. Copy it. Use your console and the command

git clone [paste project repo code]

git add: When you think you've reached a milestone, checkpoint in your code do the next three commands to update your project on github. The following command will get all of your local files and queue them up to be added to your github repo.

git add . 

git commit: Git commit just adds a message describing what you currently added to your queue. 

git commit -m ""your costume message here""


and git push: git push makes it so you push the two steps above to your project. After you hit the command git push you can see the updates on your github repo."

That being said, none of those companies will give any student of either school a second look if they themselves didn't stand out.

There are hundreds of students exactly like you, the difference is the people who got hired worked on extra projects on the side on their own.

As for CS on campus, if you're into artificial intelligence this school has several courses that will get you on the right track. Other than that, all the other courses are technical stuff."

ucr,fo3neu7,t3_g4y2dq,1587489814.0,"Having come from a CC I can tell you besides the price, a reason why CC is better, at least for CS majors, is that the prof teaches the labs. You don't have to deal with graduate students that don't teach or don't know how to speak the language. 

The downside to a CC is that most big companies don't even list CC's as an option of school when applying for internships so if you do two years at a CC that's two years you won't get opportunities to intern at a big company.

In the end it was still worth it imo after seeing how hard some students were struggling in CS12 while CC better prepared me for it."
