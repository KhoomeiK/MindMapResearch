EatingDisorders,fpj9wif,t3_gdo5tv,1588661091.0,"Part of having an ED is knowing how to train people on what topics should not be brought up...this is one of them. It might be a bit blurred here for you and your mom. We don't really know how bad it was but I can assure you, there's nothing to be ashamed of. It doesn't mean you are flawed. If anything, it means you are more equipped to be empathetic toward others. I would just let her know that commenting at all about food is triggering and all of the things you posted above. Sometimes it's helpful to have someone shine the light on things you didn't know was triggering. Without knowing how open your mom is, this is what I would consider to be the ideal. I've trained many. Big hugs to you. Congrats on your progress and know it's okay to have breakdowns."
EatingDisorders,fp515c6,t1_fp50aad,1588313023.0,I hope you get that too. Noone should be denied the support and care they need. I went to the Emily Program in Seattle. There were other people there who had horrible experiences previously before going there. It's such an insidious beast isn't it? I also saw this a little while ago which may be worth checking out: https://www.alsana.com/helpline/?adgroupid=81527646167&creative=389327163271&matchtype=b&network=g&device=m&keyword=&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=DOM+-+Dynamic+Search+(September+2019)&utm_medium=ppc&utm_term=&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=b&hsa_tgt=dsa-554157352991&hsa_src=g&hsa_ad=389327163271&hsa_ver=3&hsa_cam=6483063518&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_acc=9884161513&hsa_grp=81527646167&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7qn1BRDqARIsAKMbHDZBMWhkaUvtkaQ6TFl-YR9PIjVlWjCrki7u9N1HiinwGdR11lYtjKcaAvKmEALw_wcB
EatingDisorders,fp50t2r,t3_gb2e1a,1588312730.0,"Hey there Lettheworldknow...nice job on a big first step ( or 2nd I guess). I started my bulimia at 15 and it went up & down and on & off until I was 46. My life had become so enslaved by that illness that I finally called an ED clinic to get some support. I'm going to just offer that you check out this website and call the hotline before talking to your parents: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/
I think you'll be more equipped with handling the conversation. It also has a great resource for parents and other loved ones. I also want you to know that there is nothing to be ashamed about. This is a very serious disease and the more you understand about it the more you'll be free if it's incessant grip. There is absolutely nothing but strength in admitting that you need help. Much love, light, and healing to you."
EatingDisorders,fp504ge,t1_fp3hhd8,1588312156.0,That sucks that you had such a horrible experience. I went into intensive outpatient and it was the best. They honored people's vegan and vegetarianism.
Sourdough,fotmzsl,t1_for9b5k,1588059083.0,No pun intended with the manicure.
santacruz,fopyc4e,t3_g7wiqf,1587976302.0,I went to the same beach today and there were tracks that was from patrolling. There was also fewer people. Thanks for the advice.
santacruz,fok09zo,t3_g7krf3,1587832942.0,All I can see is how people are NOT practicing social distancing.
santacruz,fok03zv,t3_g7qug5,1587832850.0,I live in Capitols and bike to school. It takes me 30 minutes to get to the bike shuttle or bus mission or an hour to ride. The commute in the car is no big deal.
Kitchenaid,fojz9yn,t3_g7o4y5,1587832384.0,Beautiful!
UCSC,fojyyvd,t3_g7huvo,1587832213.0,Congrats!!!!
AmItheAsshole,fojwjcr,t3_g7tfxr,1587830839.0,I'm going with YTA here...You're imposing a socially constructed idea of normal to a couple who is living against (albeit better) socially constructed norms. It may feel weird and uncomfortable but that doesn't mean it's wrong.
AmItheAsshole,fojvxub,t3_g7ofqr,1587830497.0,"Damn... Redditors speak their mind. I'll just add my opinion to the thread that YTA. If you want a lifelong healthy relationship, you might want to take a deep therapuetic dive into your need to control....probably everything and not just your daughter."
AmItheAsshole,fojv7lg,t1_foju1jp,1587830073.0,I'm not religious at all but I appreciate your comment.
EatingDisorders,fojup5b,t3_g6ybsx,1587829771.0,Good info here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/
EatingDisorders,fojul45,t3_g7r4fb,1587829704.0,Check out this resource friends and call the hotline if you want to: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/
EatingDisorders,fojuemj,t1_foj5ts9,1587829597.0,"I am also a mother who suffered from bulimia from 15 off and on until age 46 when I finally got ED therapy. It was the best thing I've ever done. I was with many girls who suffered from EDs largely because their mom's hadn't gotten help themselves so projected their issues onto their kids. EDs are viscious and they are nothing to be ashamed of. They are real and have a hold on more people than we know. If you have access to an ED therapist or clinic  I would go and see what they recommend. The person above you posted a link for free DBT which is awesome. I would also check this out...super helpful info and you could call their hotline: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/
It's great that you are asking this question. I wish you the best because I know what a difficult spot you're in."
AmItheAsshole,fojsreu,t3_g7o64g,1587828617.0,Are you sure you want to get married?
AmItheAsshole,fofnrnw,t3_g72ody,1587739594.0,"OMG...NTA! First of all, hats off to you. Not many men are tuned into these things and your daughter is so lucky to have you in her side. This is triggering for me as a recovering bulimic who has had intensive treatment for this. Your wife is obviously projecting her ED issues onto your daughter and this warrants serious action. There are so many people with histories of ED who do this because they haven't gone through the hard work if healing. It's not a matter of if your daughter gets an ED, but when imo. She needs to be protected at all costs from this psychological warfare her mother has engaged in. Personally I would insist on getting therapy from an ED specialist and I would also try and get your daughter and yourself into someone right away to nip this in the bud. I know I'm being blunt and I don't like saying this, but this is abuse. Your daughter will forever appreciate the protection you provide her. I might even just consult a lawyer to get your ducks in a row just in case. Best of luck. I would love it if you kept us updated.
P.S. Doctors are clueless about EDs too. This is not about getting advice on healthy foods, counting calories, and doing more exercise. This is about psychological warfare. If you focus on doing things to slim your daughter down it will only exacerbate the problem. The focus needs to be on the wife's behavior.... Period.
Actually, I would call the hotline at NEDA.org. They are the experts here....not the Redditors....this is too serious."
TwoXChromosomes,foep4ix,t3_g6vdi5,1587710105.0,So much love to you. I'm glad you finally have some closure.
Sourdough,foenmcw,t1_foegmhe,1587708778.0,I wondered about that. What if you knead for 40 minutes and it still is too moist? Does the quality of the bread change or is it all just about the texture of the dough being ready when it's ready?
Sourdough,foe1s6e,t3_g62k88,1587694348.0,I always have to knead longer than directions. Many directions say that I only have to knead for 10 minutes and my dough will be nice and smooth enough to pass the window pane test. I use the exact measurements with a scale (metric system) and the timing never works out. What factors might I not be considering?
seriouseats,fo5t0w0,t3_g5ftnr,1587534760.0,Why are posting someone else's picture? Did you get permission?
EatingDisorders,fnyoej7,t3_g4bxhl,1587369708.0,I don't want to draw business away from the person who posted above because it sounds awesome. If it's not a good fit try here: https://www.mindfulnutritionseattle.com/ I just can't say enough about her.
EatingDisorders,fno0a9z,t3_g257tc,1587107466.0,I went through that cycle until I was 46 and decided that perhaps I could use some professional help. Getting admitted to an ED clinic was the best investment I've ever made. It took a bit to get over the stigma but once I did I was so liberated. It's okay to just throw your hands in the air and let someone else take the wheel. EDs are insidious beasts.
Sourdough,fngpbho,t3_g1ahmu,1586939961.0,Nice!
EatingDisorders,fnakbjf,t3_g0iuc2,1586798985.0,"Ugh....I feel your pain. I went through that cycle starting from 15 until I was 46 and finally decided to let someone else steer the wheel because I was too powerless to break up with that insidious beast. I even went 8 years thinking I was free and clear and then Wham! I got blindsided and then was on the slippery slope to depression and alcoholism. It started interfering with my work and severely dented my bank account. Our bank account, my husband's hard working money flushed down the toilet. I was hardly bringing home a paycheck.

The shame I felt from all of the deceit was too much. I thought will power, eating right, and getting exercise was the magic combo but instead, it fed into the disease. This is a horrible disease. It tricks you into justifying everything and it's voice is so overbearing. I needed an army to fight this so I finally consulted with an ED clinic and decided to dive in to an intensive outpatient. It was recommended I go into partial hospitalization which would have given me 45 hours of therapy a week, but I opted for a downgrade which was 25 hours. It was so scary. Within a day or two I started getting a little clarity. After 3 months I felt liberated...ish. One more year of therapy 4 hours a week was essential and now I live in a place where I don't have access. I am forever grateful for having the privilege to have gotten that therapy and rely on it everyday.

I wish you the best, all of you. I wish you compassion and love for yourselves because you are worth it. We all are. If you have the means just face it and get some good help. After all, we have nothing to lose but our chains.

Note: I tried three therapists before landing on The Emily Program in Seattle. Those previous therapists had NO idea about EDs. One, who was helping me analyze a dream about sea life compared my body to the sea lion. He literally said, ""they're big, like you."" Screw you therapist man...."
EatingDisorders,fn9aqqn,t1_fn1rtji,1586765635.0,You are so right. Sorry you haven't gotten that support from your husband. My treatment center hosted a family night once a month. If that didn't happen I don't think my husband would have learned that on his own. Nobody gets it unless they've been through it.
Sourdough,fn5kxlj,t1_fn3lqxq,1586667688.0,"I did, but I meant levain."
Sourdough,fn1rk0y,t1_fn1qqm8,1586568450.0,"Well, I don't start that until I get my initial starter through its first week. I'm 6 months new, but I know that feeding increases to 2 times a day within those first 7 days. The trick, I'm learning, is knowing how to read your starter. Once it rises and then begins to fall, it's ready to eat."
EatingDisorders,fn1rdxf,t1_fn1jfut,1586568340.0,"So much this! I started my bulimia at 15. My life slowly degraded to a desperate point at 46 when I FINALLY got serious treatment. I had no idea what I was dealing with until then. I opened up to people throughout the years, went to different therapists, and it wasn't until I found an eating disorder clinic that changed my life. Your wife knows she has a problem, but she doesn't yet understand the complexities of social messaging that perpetuates it. 

As a spouse, you are starting off right. You are trying to learn and though the adjustment will be rocky, you won't be the cause for her disorder. You also won't be the cure. This is all on her. You best role will come from learning as much as you can so you can be there for her in the most understandable way possible. You will say the wrong things, but that can't be helped. Just do your best.

 My husband was in your shoes and even came to the clinic a couple of times to get some advice and insight. Here are some tips: 1) EDs are saturated with shame...just like addictions. Being vulnerable and seeking professional help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Reluctance to get professional help is usually tied to the idea that we can fix ourselves if we just ate right AND look a certain way.  2) EDs are rarely about food, but something different. Therapy helps unpack that and provides awareness and tools to utilize other mechanisms for coping other than bulimia. 3) Categorizing foods into good and bad exacerbate EDs. 4) Commenting on any bodies is destructive...period, but most people don't know. 5) Not all therapists are created equal. A person with an eating disorder REALLY needs someone who specializes in this. I've had really traumatic experiences with therapists because they have no clue. 6) Numbers...weight, calories, steps, carbs, BMI...dangerous...feeds into the ED. 7) NEDA.org is a GREAT resource. If you want to PM me I'm happy to chat more. Check out Brene Brown's videos on vulnerability and shame. She's a gem."
EatingDisorders,fn1osyx,t1_fn17c5d,1586566662.0,"From someone who has gone to intensive outpatient therapy for bulimia don't encourage or discourage foods at all to anyone, especially those with EDs. Keep food completely off the table 😉."
Sourdough,fn1ntvb,t1_fn10ix5,1586566042.0,"I feed my starter, let it sit for a couple of hours and then toss it in the fridge until the following week. This hasn't failed me yet."
santacruz,fmz39xm,t1_fmyqtgl,1586504737.0,Rule following or considerate people? I'll take the latter.
AmItheAsshole,fmo5bf9,t3_fw945t,1586245924.0,"NTA...dogs are my favorite pets but I trained dogs are the worst. They are so smart and can do so much. Plus, your way creates less neuroticism because they know their place. Good luck with that one!"
intuitiveeating,fmo4wew,t3_fw6nwi,1586245493.0,Much love and healing your way. EDs are viscious little manipulators.  So glad you've done treatment....🤗
santacruz,fmkeco8,t3_fvjtvu,1586152145.0,Damn...is there an interview about this somewhere?
