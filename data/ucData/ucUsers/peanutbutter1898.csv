speechrecognition,fnahb7l,t1_fn97bt7,1586797504.0,"I am currently using pyttsx3, so I can do slight voice modification with their accents and gender. However, I would like to have a voice that can sound a less robotic and more oriented for children. 

I am trying to create a voice that could sound like it is coming from a toy, almost like Elmo's or Carebear's voice. Is there an API where I could change the voice to something like this? Or would I have to record it?"
