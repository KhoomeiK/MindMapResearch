UCSantaBarbara,fphypir,t3_gdiw9n,1588630284.0,"SOC 134 (Social Movements) with Tober. Not to be dramatic but I would die for Tara lol. I have taken a class with Tober every quarter since my first class with her. 10/10. She‚Äôs super funny and her classes are really interesting and she is the nicest grader ever. She is one of the few professors who actually listens to student feedback and will adjust grading to make sure everyone succeeds. I seriously miss sitting in lecture with her. If you take a class with Tara you will 100% hear stories about her kids being difficult and her husband (Dr. Bridges) making her be nicer to students. 

SOC 139RN (Race/Ethnicity/Nation) with Kelekay. The course was really interesting, the assigned readings were fantastic, we watched lots of documentaries and videos in class. Jasmine is super nice and her work is really wonderful (she works under Rios who she also got to guest lecture one day) I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs teaching this course anymore but from what I heard the material is fairly similar still. 

SOC 173 (Law) with Abra. It was such a great class. Abra is also one of my favorite lecturers at UCSB hands down. His tests are 50% reading 50% lecture which can be hard but the readings are pretty interesting. One assignment for this class is to go to the courthouse and watch a trial then write about sociological factors that influence the outcome. Super interesting assignments.

SOC 174 (Criminal Justice) with Abra. This one I liked a bit better than 173. Super super interesting material. Abra‚Äôs lectures are my favorite by far but definitely not for everyone. He doesn‚Äôt do PowerPoint or post notes or anything. He stands up there and talks which actually kept me more engaged, but I understand that doesn‚Äôt work for everyone. Abra really makes you think about everything he‚Äôs saying. I have never learned more in any class than I did in Abra‚Äôs."

LifeProTips,fozybm1,t3_gaeyhv,1588199051.0,I went with a random assignment and ended up with two girls who were best friends from high school. We didn‚Äôt really click and didn‚Äôt become best friends or anything. Didn‚Äôt spend time together outside our dorm room even once because I found my own friend group. Our sleep schedules and study habits lined up well and we were able to exist together just fine. It was nice not having to be friends because I could come back to the room and not feel obligated to talk to anyone even though they were there. Nothing more than a ‚Äúhey‚Äù was ever really exchanged. They‚Äôre awesome people and it was so much better than being friends honestly. I‚Äôm rather introverted and being able to escape people even though I shared a tiny room with two other people was way better than being best buds.
UCSantaBarbara,fozvbgf,t3_gad7tb,1588197503.0,"As someone who has never in my life been skinny, it‚Äôs really not a big deal. My own feelings and views of myself were much worse than anyone else‚Äôs. Nobody has ever said anything mean about my weight and I‚Äôve never heard anyone around me talk poorly of someone else for it. I have never once on this campus looked at someone and thought of them poorly for their weight, it‚Äôs just not a thing. People here are really chill and also very kind and supportive. Don‚Äôt get down on yourself and don‚Äôt feel like you need to look a certain way to go here. There are people of all shapes and sizes here and it doesn‚Äôt matter. My chubby ass went out to the beach here in a bikini for the first time in my life. I had never ever ever worn one and I did it here and nobody cared or looked or said anything bad.
