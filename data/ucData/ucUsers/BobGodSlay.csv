UCSD,fpitk50,t1_fpisfh4,1588648396.0,Are you on the C part or the ARM part of the assignment?
UCSD,fpfdr7a,t3_gd4z4g,1588568294.0,"I look forward to taking MATH 154- Graph Theory and CSE 100- Advanced Data Structures. I'm also interested by CSE 120, 140/140L but no idea if I'll end up getting to take those. I also really want to take some of the PHYS 160-163 sequence but I'd have to plan the prereqs in advance."
UCSD,fp497bz,t3_gb7fkc,1588294213.0,"You can [sign up for Summer classes at Foothill](https://foothill.edu/reg/admission/apply.html). You have to make an OpenCCC account and it takes some time to fill out the full form but it's pretty straightforward. I'm not sure about Financial Aid but they might have some information on their page. Their [Summer schedule](https://foothill.edu/schedule/) just got released a few days ago, and I believe everything's online. Here's the [registration calendar](https://foothill.edu/calendar/summer2020.html) for Summer."

UCSD,foxjcqa,t3_ga4r2p,1588145811.0,Aren't both uncapped? You should be able to switch whenever you want. I think the only limit is if you have >150 units you might have to submit some type of graduation plan to show that you're still on track to graduate after the major change.
UCSD,fow2ss6,t1_fow1r7q,1588111961.0,"I have friends at Stanford who got matched with very different people for roommates, and they did not really get along closely with their roommates as a result. Contrary to whatever you might think, not everyone going to Stanford is a genius or a highly motivated worker, and I think you should get used to the fact that in your life you are going to have to work with people you disagree with. 

I also think it's quite funny you're complaining that people in the comments here are not very accepting when you're the one who's adamantly against living with someone different from you.

For what it's worth, I got a single this year but I still had most of my interaction with people in my suite. I knew people with the opposite experience; they were in triples but mostly socialized with friends made outside of their rooms and rarely did anything with their roommates. The experience you have is primarily decided by your own actions rather than who you end up living with."
UCSD,fotrcds,t1_fota12k,1588063378.0,Lmao it's actually funny how it can be so easy sometimes to just mess around with inspect element and end up accessing something that's supposed to be hidden.
UCSD,fog8zhc,t3_g7c25q,1587749491.0,The description on the video is perfect.
UCSD,foeyzbl,t3_g74t2u,1587719849.0,"Absolutely yes. I really liked the scenery both on and off campus, I made some really good friends, and I loved the weather. The campus generally felt pretty relaxed and laid back, and I could go to gliderport cliff or the top of the Rady management building whenever I wanted and look at the view of the whole beach and ocean all the way out to the horizon."
UCSD,foe98fu,t1_foe7cc1,1587698634.0,Lol np inspect element is a useful tool.
UCSD,foe6ync,t1_foe699n,1587697275.0,"yeah, and make sure you selected the Summer (All) option from the dropdown if you're changing the SA20 tag so the html should go from 

<option value=""SA20""> 

to

<option value=""FA20"">"
UCSD,foe4u28,t1_foe4g35,1587696048.0,What department? When I tried searching for an invalid quarter it would just give me no results rather than giving me a different quarter.
UCSD,foe0rtv,t3_g6skmn,1587693789.0,"Schedule's already been visible for a while through the schedule of classes page. All you need to do is inspect element on the <Select search term :> dropdown button, expand the highlighted attribute, and change the SA20 to FA20, and then you can pick whatever department and submit. If the department isn't visible for Summer Session, do the same thing but with the Spring Quarter (changing SP20 to FA20 in inspect element and selecting Spring 20 from the dropdown)."

UCSD,fnk7ujr,t3_g269wi,1587017633.0,"I'm currently taking Japanese for the same language GE requirement as you. Overall, it's been interesting, and there's definitely been times where I felt like it was a lot of work, but they make it easier than other classes to maintain your grade. I think this quarter there's more work than I'd care for, but that's partially a result of the format change to online. I'd recommend the program and I think it shouldn't be too bad to get an A in the class, especially since I think the averages already tend to be around a B+ for some of those classes."
UCSD,fngds3s,t3_g1lrpv,1586929178.0,[Foothill College's CS 10](https://foothill.edu/cs/schedule.html) course [can transfer for CSE 30](https://assist.org/transfer/report/23629665). I'm not sure if their schedule is up for Summer but they have offered it online.
RotMG,fn64t68,t1_fn4wknl,1586687441.0,"Imo thirsty is essentially a free bonus. All you have to do is drink pots off the ground, and you get it. Since pots are soulbound, you can just drop them and drink them immediately, unlike back when someone else could swipe it from the bag. Drinking hp/mp out of the special inventory holders doesn't count against thirsty either, so it's almost impossible to lose once you get used to drinking off the ground."

UCSD,fn63yq7,t1_fn4vchk,1586686490.0,"I wish, I'm kinda just getting distracted and browsing youtube/reddit half the time and then spending the other half just barely keeping up with my work. My math has really been my only content-heavy class so far, so my schedule hasn't really had any major issue yet. It also helps that I'm interested in most of my classes so doing the work for them doesn't feel as if I have to force myself to finish something just because it's due."
UCSD,fn4qwvr,t3_fz2hh4,1586647044.0,"5 classes, 23 units, and I'm trying to stay motivated to keep doing my work. The one fallback I do have is if I need to I'll just P/NP my college writing. Overall my math and MMW feel like a bulk of my work, and those two are definitely more of a time commitment than they were last quarter."
UCSD,fmvlge5,t1_fmruus4,1586421309.0,Is it just me or has ECE 17 not really covered any content yet? I feel so confused in that class because idk if I'm just not following along properly or if he hasn't actually taught anything yet.
UCSD,fmk2lwu,t3_fvr0xv,1586143046.0,"11 is better if you want fast review, since you said you've already covered that material before. It's also going to cover more material than 8B so you can really review the entire range of content that 12 expects you to know."
