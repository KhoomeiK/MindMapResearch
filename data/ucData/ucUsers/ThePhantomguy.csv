gachagaming,fpdvcb5,t3_gce9hr,1588534974.0,"A lot of people love the story in the game. Tbh, it’s a little too clunky for me, which may be due to translation. But even as a harsher critic of the story, Camelot and the Lost Belt were actually really enjoyable."

fastfood,fp4tabn,t3_gaxjts,1588306830.0,"I wonder if this is just a marketing spin on them selling excess inventory of food, kinda like how Panera's offerring to sell groceries to you, but it's just their extra stuff."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fozjiat,t1_foysakm,1588191711.0,"Is it like a toggle? Is it press the button to release the rod and it sprays, the press it again to stop and retract? It seems like it could potentially be pretty messy, especially if poop accidentally gets stuck in the little chamber the rod retracts into."

SDSGrandCross,foxay1t,t3_g9iktq,1588138644.0,"Hey is there something to card effects that I'm not understanding? Sometimes when I use a card that should deplete boss king's ult orbs, it doesn't deplete? It's not being patienced either. Do card effects only have a chance of being applied or something? It feels pretty unfair.

EDIT: nvm im dumb as hell lmao. Thanks ya'll :) gl on escanor pulls"

SDSGrandCross,fng0wjq,t3_g16b0b,1586919740.0,"Yeah I’m not a fan of Nagato. His video on gold farming had a lot of wasted time that stretched his video barely past the 10 minute mark. I’m unsure if that was intentional so that he could put some more ads on it since it passed 10 minutes. I don’t mind if content creators talk about their life or make some jokes, but Nagato was really just adding a lot of mindless rambling in the video. That video could have easily been 5 minutes long."
