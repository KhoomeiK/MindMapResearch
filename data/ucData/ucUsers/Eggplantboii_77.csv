BigBrother,fp8zy8v,t1_fp8w34v,1588409037.0,"If not, they can easily go a more attainable route with a Derrick/Vanessa/Paul/Tyler showdown because at least they’re more recent and probably more willing"
BigBrother,fp878uy,t1_fp86oav,1588385295.0,"it was Chima’s HOH not Jessie’s.
And due to winning she was safe from nomination, as was the POV holder"
BigBrother,fp85ku8,t3_gbukds,1588384095.0,they mean it in regard to the coup d’etat i’m pretty sure.
BigBrother,fp4ig34,t3_gb9ite,1588299756.0,Casting wouldn’t be the problem — they have enough online apps and hold finals via skype. The problem would be the the safety of the crew and whether or not i can even run in the first place if its not an essential business
BigBrother,fp4e6tq,t1_foug9fs,1588297140.0,"They both aired the same in 2000, Survivor just benefits from 2 seasons a year."
BigBrother,fp3ym2j,t1_fp3w7rh,1588288252.0,"They only have influence over the finale where they decode who wins. Hopefully, they give the Final 2 an equal edit though because otherwise that would suck."
BigBrother,fp3g8lz,t3_gb2onq,1588278766.0,"I personally have it ranked 12/29 that i’ve watched. I split it the seasons up into tiers though so its only in the “Good Tier” but it was so dynamic with messy, interesting gameplay that it was enjoyable to watch.


I feel like it’ll get the BB15 treatment in a few years and people will come around to it once they’re more removed."
BigBrother,fp1o7do,t1_fozvr8z,1588242370.0,12 is not more entertaining than 9. If you said it was better gameplay bc The Brigade then yeah I’s agree but BB9 was actually fucking crazy almost every week.
BigBrother,fp1kxc1,t1_fovs7yh,1588239071.0,If they pulled a backwards week though and chose the person with the least amount of votes from the options the HGs gave I feel like it could draw lines in a way that causes a power shift
BigBrother,fp0n74j,t3_gaien2,1588212679.0,BB9 is actually an entertaining mess that’s enjoyable to watch because there is a good back and forth and some decent drama (when it doesn’t get too nasty)
BigBrother,foxzcqa,t1_foxgssy,1588161200.0,“you’re a really ugly person the inside” is Neda’s exact response when Ika tells her her existence is trash.
BigBrother,fox1vr2,t1_fox1fxl,1588132109.0,you’re a really ugly person on the inside
UCSantaBarbara,fowjyeg,t1_fowi6dw,1588121250.0,anyone who knows how to read the GE requirements on GOLD could give someone that advice
BigBrother,fowe950,t1_foumxd4,1588118078.0,and Tyler made it to F2 and still lost. Your point?
BigBrother,fotuyr9,t1_foto0tz,1588067055.0,"If Vanessa makes it to F2 she wins, which is more impressive than Tyler going there being “unsuspected” and still losing. And she would have won even with the flawed jury questioning. 

The fact that everyone knew that Vanessa was shady, tried multiple times to flip on her, and yet was STILL a crapshoot question away from winning speaks volumes to her skill."
BigBrother,foq5i4g,t1_fol177r,1587983736.0,"I mean you’re not “supposed” to vote for any criteria except for “who you want to win the game” as Julie/Arisa say every finale.

I feel “bitter jury” only ever applies to people that the fans think should have won because literally every season of this show has had the person who the jury liked more win except for maybe like BB20 and CAN1."
BigBrother,foq584e,t3_g8wsru,1587983447.0,"Jenn, Kara, Jojo, Jodi, Chef Joe, Ashley, and Wil are wayyy too many duds for this season to be considered that amazing. The only newbies of any importance were Ian, Shane, Danielle, and Frank. Even of these four, Shane was boring vanilla and Danielle was fucking crazy.

And on the vets side, Janelle/Boogie leaving pre-jury kills any entertainment that could have come from them. Dan/Britney carrying the entertainment for the majority of the season makes it fine but nowhere near my top tier. Out of the 28 seasons I’ve watched, I have it ranked 17 in the “Good Tier”"
BigBrother,folas59,t1_folaglb,1587858300.0,BBAUS was pre-recorded and the houseguests have already left the house.
BigBrother,fokvmsw,t1_foejo4r,1587849811.0,"I’m not saying that they loved Kaela, just that I feel their appreciation for Paras trumped that. Maddy literally laid down and died once Paras started crying about her betrayal and was going into jury tearing down Kaela’s pitch and hyping up Paras’. 

Ryan loved Paras because she hung out around him a LOT the week he should have gone home on Kaela’s HOH and the week he actually left."
BigBrother,fokvb96,t3_g7ytb2,1587849635.0,"15 is really REALLY good gameplay wise but a lot of nasty racism really bogs it down. 

6, 8, 10 are solid seasons that you should watch.


11, 12, 13 would introduce you to some big faces of the franchise (JeJo, Britney, Rachel+Brendan) but I think 12 is kind of a slog. 11 is fun from the TV edit and 13 i have a soft spot for bc it was my first."
BigBrother,foidji1,t1_fogj18w,1587784160.0,11 was enjoyable bc there was a decent back and forth (albeit because of the Coup) and any sort of disdain people hold due to feed moments can’t be experienced anymore bc we can only watch the edited episodes
BigBrother,foi4z4p,t1_fohcmz0,1587778815.0,loved seeing karen on! you should invite some of the other CAN5 to pop in occasionally!!!
BigBrother,foejbhc,t1_foehby7,1587705266.0,she benefited from having Ryan and Maddy in that jury who were so down for her (i feel that both loved Paras more than they disliked Kaela tbh) that they campaigned for her to win to Alivia/Johnny. That’s not luck or a bitter jury tho
BigBrother,fo635os,t1_fo42zkv,1587544755.0,Kaela playing 4D chess wow
BigBrother,fo62t18,t1_fo5xwgy,1587544383.0,a slept on season i will defend her until i die
BigBrother,fo2hy0u,t1_fo0kzmt,1587463121.0,a recruit is just someone they ask to go through the audition process: Like they still have to submit a tape/go to an open call like everyone else.
BigBrother,fnys4d2,t1_fny4uos,1587373590.0,mods exPLAIN
BigBrother,fnri26j,t1_fnrhyah,1587189598.0,shorten a BB week by a few days like that stretch of time between POV comp and ceremony to speed that bitch uP
BigBrother,fnrhj4s,t3_g3d9gu,1587189136.0,Alex cotton mouth coming back after fucking up her eviction speech in OTT lol

BigBrother,fnkord4,t3_g2buau,1587035152.0,"helen never wanted to come back so she did production a favor and told them to tap her foot when they had enough footage of her, knowing it’d be caught on camera so she could live in BB Infamy for the rest of time."
BigBrother,fnjwr9n,t1_fnhms8h,1587008831.0,“Your game can NOT match up to mine!”

BigBrother,fnjt2gd,t1_fnjcmh1,1587006339.0,Oh is Kail the straight laced mom? bc I was thinkin Amber and was soo confused lol
BigBrother,fnfk2vt,t1_fnfjnb8,1586909594.0,Taking away live feeds and making a daily recap episode for CBS All Access would more or less have the same effect of watching real time
BigBrother,fncjvba,t1_fncjmoy,1586838613.0,Da’Vonne was a fav no? At least a production fav for sure I think they were disappointed she left so early in 17
BigBrother,fnb4jn2,t3_g0qauz,1586809088.0,"I would love to see an Instant or a Triple eviction just to see how they would react. Like don’t make them staples like CAN has, but throw them in randomly like they do for a Coup d’Etat or a DPOV."
BigBrother,fnb46g0,t1_fnb04e8,1586808907.0,Neda said she was going to be a major bitch in CAN5 because she already came across as one in CAN2....
BigBrother,fnb3uvg,t1_fnamkro,1586808749.0,and I honestly doubt either Cass or Dallas would be able to win a competition to get her out once jury started
BigBrother,fn96z62,t1_fn8wo41,1586761613.0,"Because they aren’t in the house anymore? Anyone watching the season for the first time would only really see the season in the context of the edit, which made the season much better. Anyone watching the season back would see it in a better light because of the way its edited too. 

I’m doing a rewatch right now and I’m finding the season to be better than when I watched it live."
BigBrother,fn874fh,t3_g05bo2,1586735324.0,"The only way anyone can experience the season now is based off of the TV edit — so based off of that I think it’d be considered a good season on rewatch. You still see how hateful the 8 person alliance is but it serves as a good comeuppance for them when the alliance is picked off one by one. 


I would say it drags until the week Cliff/Nick/Bella are blindsided, Bella gets evicted on Cliff’s HOH, and then Sam’s eviction where Six Shooters explodes."
survivor,fmyi5gm,t1_fmy7t0q,1586486739.0,isn’t old-school in Survivor considered any season before HvV? Kim’s season was 24
BigBrother,fmuf2b8,t1_fmtaxfk,1586390140.0,Maddy Final 4 robbed queen confirmed?
BigBrother,fmqhwsh,t1_fmigh4b,1586299937.0,they hadn’t even reached the jury phase of the game yet lol chill with that observation
BigBrother,fmqds97,t1_fmqd9ic,1586297713.0,the houseguests would be safe but I feel like a major part of CAN being cancelled was the susceptibility the large crew had with being forced to interact in confined spaces
BigBrother,fmkza5r,t1_fmkm670,1586174067.0,"Similarly, I’ve heard that Bruno pushing for Godfrey to win CAN3 pushed people away from that and towards voting for whichever of Ashleigh/Sarah were in the F2 with him."
BigBrother,fmko1hq,t1_fmkna9c,1586161888.0,where was the strategy from angela?
BigBrother,fmcbi4z,t1_fmc9ouq,1585942507.0,the prob i see is the gender ratio would be greatly imbalanced unless you include like the celebs and Morgan
