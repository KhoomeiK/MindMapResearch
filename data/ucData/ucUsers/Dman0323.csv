UCSantaBarbara,foziugs,t3_gad7tb,1588191391.0,"As a big lad myself, I can say you'll be fine. You're not gonna get bullied for it. I mean it sucks when me and my friends go to the beach and I'm the only one with a shirt on, but it's something I can change if I want. Don't let some bullshit thing like weight influence where you go. You have no idea how insignificant that shit is. I'm over weight and not at all attractive and I still find relative ease meeting people. It's really about the vibe you give off. Just about all the people I've met don't care who they hang out with in terms of looks, they only care about the vibes bro."
