UCSC,fpmpuw8,t1_fpmpklh,1588738638.0,Math.random() played a roll. Actually I think it is determined by what was stated in your financial aid package.

UCSC,fny64c2,t3_g4lbmn,1587354335.0,"Fellow old transfer student. Firstly, Congrats on coming! Actually, 28 is not even that old for a transfer student. You'll see plenty of us our here. I don't know how your roommate will react, but I have friends of all ages on campus, and I have never felt like I stuck out because of my age. Also, dorm is not your only option - there are a lot of open places for rent right now in town."

UCSC,fnr6180,t3_g2u58y,1587180160.0,"I took it at CC, and found 120 pretty easy imo. It seemed like most of the 120 material was review from my CC class."
UCSC,fnlsqf3,t1_fnlrqe7,1587059074.0,"Not sure. I didn't, but I think they use an algorithm to screen applicants in BSOE. Are there any classes you'd need to take at UCSC that you can take at your CC in the mean time? I did an extra year of math and physics beyond what is required at UCSC and found it really helpful in my studies."

UCSantaCruz,fnjnox2,t1_fnjma9y,1587002847.0,"A game with an smart AI opponent, chat room over the internet, simple online multiplayer game. Just make what interest you. I am always working on a project during my free time. I made the AI in CC, so even projects that seem difficult should be doable with what you know now.

Out of class projects really make you stand out."
UCSantaCruz,fnjaq1o,t1_fnj9tro,1586995219.0,"Before transferring, I compared the required classes for graduation, plus possible electives that go with me CS interest. I liked UCSCs ML/AI curriculum, and thought the ""Software Engineering"" project courses would be really good for my resume. Aside from that, lots of bay area companies recruit form here, and I was able to find a awesome internship. About half of my friends got internships so its hit or miss. I had already wrote a few projects on my spare time, so that might have been the factor that helped me out."
UCSantaCruz,fnj9mtm,t3_g1syzx,1586994610.0,"It is impossible to compare with UCs we don't attend, but everything is pretty good here. One main problem is it is very difficult to get into the classes you want."
