Wizard101,fpc6ilo,t1_fpc2o9w,1588489249.0,i‚Äôm a returning player too. what happened in the new update that ruined things?
UCSD,fpc51kq,t1_fpc402d,1588487843.0,"From the two professors I have taken thus far, they are the most genuine down to earth people. They teach very well and explain concepts in great detail (it‚Äôs mostly my fault in not being able to understand right away) and truly want the best out of their students. They both took inputs and criticisms from their students to heart to best accommodate their learning experience.

Another positive (coming from a person who has never coded in their life prior to college) is that the PAs are hard af especially in CSE 8B. They make sure that you understand the concept well enough to implement it (although there is a bit of hand holding through it all with ‚Äúfill in the blank‚Äù sort of questions/problems). Although it‚Äôs pretty tough, it really tests your mental fortitude to get through it all. And the satisfaction of having that code you‚Äôve been working on for hours is just so satisfying.

The thing about the CS dungeon being so full is partly due to the fact that so many people wait last minute to start the project and do it the night it‚Äôs due. BUT if you go earlier in the week, let‚Äôs say the day the PA is assigned, a tutor will always be ready if not just a 5-10 minute wait away to help you, and depending on the tutor, they give really easy to digest instructions on how the code works and why it works. Often times I find myself learning a great deal from those tutors just as much as attending a lecture.

I guess another positive is that the CSE dungeon is pretty close to where the shuttle stops (Price Center) so I have only a short walk to get there haha"
UCSD,fpc3bu8,t1_fpbyqsl,1588486259.0,"Priority registration works like this. When applying for a CSE class you will be, along with other people signing up for the class, put into a waitlist. Then someone will hand pick the CS students to be enrolled into the class first. Then come the secondary majors allowed to get in (eg. Bioinformatics). Finally, all the other majors. 

As for the negatives for the CS courses, in my own personal experience as a first year Computer Engineering student, are that it gets hella packed in those lecture halls. Often times i feel like i‚Äôm sardined in there. Also, I found that it gets really saturated in the CS dungeon especially when a PA is due, which leads to minimal help from tutors (5 min time cap for help!!) and long wait times (i had to wait 4 hours for help, and by then i already fixed what was wrong with my code). That why it‚Äôs said time and time again, ‚Äústart early, start often‚Äù, which is a common saying amongst the CSE department that holds true.

Plus while being in a quarter system, everything goes by so fast and I often feel like i‚Äôm left in the dust to try and figure out and understand concepts taught the week prior. 

I have yet to experience any shitty TAs, but my friend had a bad experience with CS tutors/TAs when it came to helping them. They struggled in the class and asked for help through tutor hours, but when they helped her and she didn‚Äôt understand, the tutor straight up asked them if they have ADHD, and my friend took offense to this."
piano,folsaxk,t3_g86oi3,1587869300.0,Also this isn‚Äôt 100% the same as how it was played in the ad but pretty close
UCSD,fnxhtnh,t3_g3fm1p,1587338927.0,"Yea I was thinking the same thing too lol. If I had like 3 more minutes or so, I would‚Äôve been able to write more legibly üò¨"
