ApplyingToCollege,fp1cf37,t1_fp1bfdx,1588230921.0,Omg I must have misread your comment lol. You should look into the Human Behavior and Psychology domain emphasis offered for the Data Science major. Berkeley is for sure unique in that data science can be very interdisciplinary. Good luck with your decision I can‚Äôt imagine how difficult this is!! You‚Äôll end up at a great school regardless :)
ApplyingToCollege,fp1bu92,t3_gapr6c,1588230392.0,"Honestly a full ride is a full ride and if you‚Äôre not comfortable with taking on debt, then I suggest you go to SMU. Berkeley is great don‚Äôt get me wrong but it won‚Äôt be the deciding factor in future employment (internships, gpa, grad school, etc. will help out a lot). If you still feel like your undergad isn‚Äôt enough then you can use like half of what you‚Äôd take on in debt (probably less) and put it towards a grad program in CS (maybe at Berkeley?) and you‚Äôll be 100x more competitive. Goodluck with your decision!"
ApplyingToCollege,fp1batq,t3_gapsoo,1588229911.0,"DO NOT DOUBLE DEPOSIT. Although this year is kinda wack, I‚Äôve heard that they can rescind people if they find out so I wouldn‚Äôt risk it. As for advice, data science might actually be better for your program because it involves both cs and data collection/analysis for a wide range of fields (including psych/forensic work). If the psych department is as strong as you say it is m, then doubling in Data Science and Psych would be a big pro for UCLA. Definitely do more research though and for sure look into the research/internship opportunities at both schools because that is probably the next biggest factor. Congrats and goodluck!!!"

ApplyingToCollege,fnniqfc,t3_g2ttfs,1587093306.0,"ACT = 100x better than the SAT imo. I don‚Äôt recommend relying on prep books. Your son should use previously released tests to practice from and correct his mistakes from. The rest is very straight forward and mistakes are easily fixed. Unlike the SAT, you can find dozens of official ACT tests online for free so it shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to get a good score as long as he is determined and keeps at those practice tests

Edit: given the situation tho don‚Äôt worry too much about testing for rn. A lot of college will probably be cancelling their test requirements but if he still needs to take it, fall testing is a more likely date then the summer."

berkeley,fnj4isf,t3_g22ac0,1586991814.0,"Dude I recommend to just go along with your parents picking a roommate for you and then trying your best to fill out the housing application on your own.

Then when you get your housing offer just tell your parents that your first option (women only building) filled up and you were assigned your last option (any room any location). This may be sketch but it could work. I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your parents and I wish you luck.

Edit: definitely get real with your parents once you leave for college and ask for more privacy because you are an adult now and they should treat you as such."

ApplyingToCollege,fniytsi,t1_fniygf6,1586988809.0,Yea it‚Äôs kinda shocking that OP was able to make a 250 point increase on the sat but fails to see the connection between family income and sat performance. It goes to show that a good sat score doesn‚Äôt always mean intelligence lol
ApplyingToCollege,fniy9ct,t3_g21qy5,1586988511.0,"I think the argument is that they receive a lower quality education and it becomes more difficult to improve their score without direct help as in you can‚Äôt improve unless someone helps you aka a tutor and khan academy does a poor job at explaining this for the english/reading. Also many low income students are casted out by society into improvised neighbors that have high schools with low academic standards. Additionally, they don‚Äôt have parents that can support them academically since they‚Äôre always working and worrying about how they‚Äôre gonna make next months rent. There are probably many other factors that I didn‚Äôt mention but it‚Äôs very hard to ignore the trend that SAT scores have with a student‚Äôs family income level, but we can agree to disagree."

Also I wasn‚Äôt in the advance math classes at my school either but I took summer math classes at a CC and I feel like it really helped my application Bc it showed my initiative to further my math background. Also in the EC section you can add summer classes at a CC as an academic opportunity/program you took. If you can‚Äôt find many major-related ECs this summer than perhaps focus on your writing spike and a summer math class or even science class like Hum Bio and then in the fall you can do another major related EC such as hospital volunteering or research.
