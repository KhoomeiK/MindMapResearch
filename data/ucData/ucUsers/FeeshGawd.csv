ApplyingToCollege,fole7rb,t3_g849t3,1587860334.0,"USC perspective:
Grade inflation/deflation: Viterbi has THICC curves, Marshall classes curve to a B (heard they’re pretty easy though). I’d say I’ve never really seen that much of an issue with inflation/deflation. USC won’t kill your GPA, but you definitely learn a crap ton.

Pre-med: From what I hear from my pre-med friends, a lot of the classes and professors are geared towards teaching for the MCAT even as early as Gen Chem. An example would be the way they structure their exams and pose their exam questions. From a certain perspective it could be good, preparing you for the big test. Some have complained about it making things super difficult in intro courses, but YMMV.

Prestige: bruh

CS: I like our program. Definitely a lot of things that they could improve on, but more administrative than content related. Everyone’s super collaborative *cough* Berkeley *cough* and willing to help out. I feel like USC CS has taught me so much even in my limited time here so far. Advising is great too.
