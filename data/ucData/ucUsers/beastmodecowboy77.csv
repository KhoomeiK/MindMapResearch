berkeley,fntcbz9,t3_g3swzg,1587238817.0,"When our football team is winning, school spirit is pretty great, and it seems like our team is on the upswing. Last year we went 8-5 including a bowl game win and a big game victory over Stanford for the first time in ten years. With the only returning qb in the division, we might push for the Pac-12 North title this season. Our student section was completely full for the ASU and USC games last season and I expect that to be true for every PAC-12 home game this season if we keep winning. If you do come to Cal, you‚Äôve picked a great time to do so, as our football team is finally experiencing success and should have a lot more in the upcoming years! Go Bears!"
