Nurse,fo0rcrb,t1_fo0q5ef,1587418337.0,"I couldn’t agree more! The situation we are in is shameful!

That being said, someone needs to take care of the patients who can’t take care of themselves.

This is a career defining moment. I stepped back into direct care for this crisis, and my hope is that when this is over, we can better argue for the value of managers who have direct experience with patients.

There’s a proliferation of career middle management in healthcare, with people who have forgotten how to actually serve the patient."
Nurse,fo0nnqd,t3_g4zmaz,1587416390.0,"Nursing is a wonderfully diverse field. There’s room for the single mother who needs a good paying career to support her family, and the those who see nursing as a “calling”.

In my mind, the trouble comes when people demand that “calling” attitude. Nursing is a job, not an identity.

As a young, healthy man with no dependents and a public university nursing education, I certainly feel there’s a social contract for me to uphold. I feel a duty to use my skills to help the society that gave me so much, even if these problems were manufactured by greed and criminal incompetence.

That being said, your motivations and goals for your practice are every bit as valid and deserving of respect as mine. I hope you stay safe and I hope your local government gets their heads out of their asses to realize the only appreciation we will acknowledge right now comes in the form of gloves, gowns, masks, and institutional changes."

I’m completely ignorant of any social / political issues, but it would not surprise me if there was discrimination in urban Nepal against the Sherpa people. If that’s the case, using the term Sherpa may be seen as reinforcing these differences."

hempflowers,fnlep25,t1_fnl9suu,1587052241.0,"I have worked in healthcare for over a decade. This is the kind of behavior I’ve seen from sooooo many administrators and managers who are indoctrinated that their only job is financial. They pay other people to care.

Check out the ongoing dumpster fire in /r/nursing about how hospitals are handling this. They make those they’ve paid to care into unwilling martyrs."
Nurse,fni2g1k,t1_fnhkayc,1586972843.0,"Probation for posting a lab simulation? That’s absurd and reinforces the attitude that nurses are here to follow orders and rules, not to think for ourselves.

You have a right to your own personal attitudes about media and work, but you need to respect the attitudes of others.

Social media is not all “look at me! Smash my like button!” And can be an incredible tool for outreach, as well as humanizing our profession.

My life is my story, and my work is an incredibly important part of that story. If you can’t tell the difference between posting inappropriate photos at work and sharing what you experience at work, then god help the next patient that requires any critical thinking.

IMO, there’s a big spectrum, and these Tiktok videos land in the “tone deaf and not appreciated” direction, but are a far cry from “extremely unprofessional, but not explicitly illegal (USA)” end of posting de-identified care photos."
UCI,fnb97bt,t3_g0mavy,1586811426.0,"Honestly, this is how it should be.

Ideas are always going to be easier than execution, but the difference is never more dramatic than when you first start trying to execute your ideas. Much better to start learning that now than later.

So do your best, and fail with grace. Stay true to what you campaigned for, do your best to uphold the duties of your office, and don't forget that this too is a part of the learning experience.

Warmly,

Alumn from a few years back"
nursing,fnai08k,t3_g04hwn,1586797846.0,"You need your own personal professional malpractice policy, and you need it yesterday."
nursing,fnaht9d,t3_g0fw15,1586797753.0,"You absolutely deserve help with this. You are not alone. There are resources, but the ones that you will benefit most from are likely specific and specialized.

I would consider seeing a very specialized therapist with a considerable amount of experience. You mentioned that you are seeing one, but the therapist you see can make a HUGE difference. You don't need a 'primary care doc' therapist, you need the specialist that they should ideally be able to refer to.

Some people find it beneficial to give a name to our problems (PTSD, Depressions, etc.) and some people don't. IMO You need someone who has been in the field long enough to understand that mental health diagnoses are syndromes, not diseases. There are incredible benefits to examining groups of symptoms that present similarly, but this must be balanced with a very individualized focus of treatment.

I've personally spent years dealing with symptoms that might be labeled as PTSD as well as Depression, and I can say without question that when you give the issue the attention it deserves, when you invest in yourself the way you invest in your patients, IT GETS BETTER.

My girlfriend is a mental health counselor and my best friend is a mental health counselor. Both of them have their own counselors and spent a decent amount of time searching for them. Someone who is in a 'helping' field will often require more than the general help available. Both of them also say they think EVERYONE should have a therapist or counselor.

If you prefer a humanistic approach rather than the traditional biomedical disease model approach, the Polish psychologist Kazimierz Dabrowski has some INCREDIBLE writing that has given me quite a few tools to address my mental health and honestly changed my life. His approach is centered around post-traumatic growth - the belief that there is a spectrum for reception to emotional feeling (perhaps in a similar way to differences in pain tolerance as a loose example).

Some of us may feel more intensely than others, and while that might not create problems for many people in our society, nurses still face the ugly realities of life, death, and much, much more which our modern world shields many from. It is a blessing and a curse, but your efforts, the help you receive, and the attitude you have towards it can help to determine which it will ultimately be.

At the end of the day, these feelings sound like they come from caring deeply about your patients and the way your actions affect them. That is what we NEED in our health system. You deserve the tools to make those feelings an asset, and I hope from the bottom of my heart that you find them and find your peace.

You mentioned working towards your BSN, but having few incentives. Fuck the incentives, invest in yourself. This experience is your application essay to any BSN program in the country. I'd venture to suggest that you question your role as an ED nurse because you no longer feel like you have sufficient tools to address the situations that you now know you will face. This is the ultimate reason to pursue additional education, for the benefit of those you care for. (I'm not trying to suggest that finance isn't of concern, but that we have a social contract to invest in exactly your type of person. If this hospital won't invest in you, find someone who will. I promise they are out there.)

When you have your BSN, being able to describe and relate that journey is your ticket to care for patients ANYWHERE you want.

This is not to say staying in the ED is right, or leaving the ED is right; nor is this to say that pursuing education is the ""correct"" avenue. This is to say that all of these things are your choices, and you have the power to control the direction in which your life goes.

We cannot change our stars, but we can change the direction in which we use them to sail. There will be storms and there will be trade winds. As the saying goes, 'A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not why ships are built'. That in mind, don't forget where ships are repaired and refitted for the storms to come. Sometimes fog obscures some of the paths we might otherwise want to take. Talking about your journey with others can help give you a decent map.

Well wishes in all your journeys,

J"
