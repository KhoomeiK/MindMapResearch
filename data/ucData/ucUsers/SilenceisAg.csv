Definitely don't give up if this is what you want to do. Your cGPA is above the 3.0 minimum required for a lot of schools, which is VERY good news, and your sGPA is only a little bit below that minimum at 2.89. So just take only science classes at a CC to move your sGPA up to the 3.0 mark and keep working your PCE job. By the time you apply, which can be as early as next cycle depending on how many classes you take; you will have a ton of PCE to make up for your low GPA. Many, MANY applicants get in with a low GPA and high PCE. Just take a look at the accepted collection the mods started a few weeks ago.

Finally, your LOR choices look fine. I would caution submitting five because many programs will only read the first three or however many their programs require.
