GhostRecon,fpkewhc,t1_fpjyug5,1588693429.0,"Engineers aren't really a stealth class, seeing as their class item gives you more ammo for more dakkas, and their class skill is a drone that helps you dakka even more.

So just go in hard and loud and kill all drones first!"

startrek,fpe8snv,t1_fpdnel9,1588542640.0,"I don't know if I'd compare the treatment of the synths by the Zhat Vash a 'death threat'...

The Zhat Vash up to that point has assassinated multiple synths; commandeered and destroyed a bunch of Martian synths (albeit they've got lower cognitive capabilities). They outright believe in the complete and total extermination of all synth life and tell the synths so. Then they bring their armada over to the home of the synths to glass the planet.

An equivalent analogy would be if you and a few others are the only (insert race) people around, and a private army led by a cult leader the size of a full navy fleet comes at your door AFTER they've killed your friends and family AND told you that they're there to completely exterminate you and everyone like you.

Yeah, I'd call an ICBM to my location if that was the threat on my existence."

realestateinvesting,fobi7av,t1_fobhk3n,1587660063.0,My bookings were for May 14-19! Maybe that's still too far ahead of a cancelation?
realestateinvesting,foawweu,t1_fo8r5x3,1587653573.0,"Wait, what? I did not know that I could have gotten a full refund on my booking... When I went to cancel, AirBnB refunded the paid first half as future travel credit.

My host had the same policy as you do (half refund after the first 48 hours of booking and before 7 days out)."

And if you aren't, how is it that the laptop's a clunker? A GTX 1080 is still pretty high-end these days..."
GamingLaptops,fo76fan,t1_fo73pvn,1587573054.0,"Thank you! All these lowballers have just been slowly driving me crazy. One guy even messaged me back after a week or so taunting me if I've found another seller.

$875 is even the price I told him that I'd be willing to sell for.

I guess I just have to remind myself that it's a tough time right now and no one's shelling out $900 casually."
GhostRecon,fo71u2w,t3_g6366c,1587570756.0,"Yes, it is. It's far more important to know the mechanics and communicate than it is to have a high gear score. If you hit your headshots, the enemies die in one shot anyways."

AskScienceFiction,fo4yytz,t1_fo4tfae,1587514003.0,"I mean, I suspect that Stormbreaker can still kill Thanos in Endgame, but this Thanos is still furious with battle spirit AND fueled with Infinity War Thanos' knowledge. Thor would have to hit him with it first, and Endgame-Thanos is not gonna just repeat the same combat mistake that did him in in Infinity War."

elderscrollsonline,fnk63x1,t1_fnk5h2v,1587016090.0,"I guess there are just varying degrees of 'fake' roles then. Some people put no effort in and only has the intention of playing DPS when queuing as a Tank or Healer. Others put in the minimal work that'll barely qualify as that role (e.g. Taunting boss, but has no other Tanking skill slotted.)

For normal dungeons, I've just tried to make it a challenge for myself when I get stuck with a fake Tank/Healer. For veteran dungeons, it's usually impossible to do harder DLC dungeons with people who fake those roles anyways. Hell, there are plenty of crap DPSers but no one wants to ban them from queuing for veteran dungeons."
elderscrollsonline,fnk5ty6,t3_g2694j,1587015849.0,I was in a sinilar boat with my MagCro a bit back. What I found helpful in staying with one character is having a long-term goal to work towards. Ive been experimenting and trying to improve my DPS and I've found myself continuously discovering new mechanics and tricks! Keeps playing one character continually interesting.
elderscrollsonline,fnk5dkq,t3_g21w6v,1587015462.0,"Eh... I'll admit it's pretty annoying queuing for veteran dungeons and ending up with a fake tank, but for normal dungeons, I queue my DPS as a tank /Healer all the time. Slap on a sustain heal skill and you're practically invulnerable, throw on a taunt and boss will never break its attention from you.

It'd probably do ZOS more good to make proper tutorials for new players to understand mechanics than it is to ban veteran players from role 'faking'."
elderscrollsonline,fnk4pqm,t1_fnk192o,1587014900.0,That's odd because I definitely feel like they fixed it. My BBs hit pretty consistently on time regardless of distance now!

GhostRecon,fmn4646,t1_fmmarr8,1586217830.0,"Maybe they'll make an easier version of the Raid where you CAN go in with the AI teammates for the cosmetic loots?

I'd be down for the cosmetics to be available, but the 'easier' Raids will not drop >250 GS gear."
GhostRecon,fmalsuc,t1_fmajhrc,1585898638.0,"Just completed the raid for the first time.

Definitely reminds me of MGS.

Weak point! Kiting mechanic!"
