LOONA,fnc341b,t1_fnc1c9i,1586827605.0,"Since we are most likely going to do the same thing for all future releases, perhaps you can take an “Orbit baseline” for some release which is purely targeted towards Orbits? Such as 365 since it’s a fan song and its sales should be from orbits only. Then again, we are charting for popularity which affects sales too so idk lul."

UCSD,fmv01bt,t1_fmuzdcl,1586402777.0,I feel yah. Cept I consider this something I must do since there’s no one else. Sort of makes me wish I majored in business/finance instead. Just a little.
UCSD,fmum0f6,t3_fx9i7l,1586394032.0,"Ooh man any of you guys also dealing with the small business loans that’s happening in USA? 

As the best English speaker in my family I’ve been stressing hard helping my parents and relatives to fill out their loans since the people at the bank and my parent’s accountants are swamped. Not to mention it’s all first come first served so times a pressuring.

I’m not even that great at English and my knowledge of legal/financial jargon is basically nothing. Was googling every term I saw.

K rant over thanks for listening."
