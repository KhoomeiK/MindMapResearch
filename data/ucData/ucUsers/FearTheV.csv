quarantineactivities,fp8ix5y,t1_fp8dgfc,1588393491.0,"Omg that was exactly my question. I kind just threw a few dried out cherry tomatoes in there. I think in two weeks I’ll move them? Cuz there are some growing right on top of each other. 

A friend of mine was like “oh no just forget about that and just water them” but that mostly means they’ll compete with each other, some will die off leading to a lower yield, so eventually, logic dictates we separate them.

What do you have growing?"

unpopularopinion,fodik9a,t3_g6xfoh,1587685134.0,"I totally understand wha you mean. I feel like a little of your disconnect here is because you’ve never had that one-on-one “you’re my human” bond with a pet, and I agree the “my pet adopted me” is weird and needs to stop, but I can *totally* relate to when people say their pet rescued or saved them. 

These are living creatures, and although they aren’t on our level of consciousness and cognizance, they have emotions and convey them in ways words don’t. They rescue us in the sense that they’ve changed our lives and allowed us to grow in many ways otherwise not possible. The appreciation my dog has for me after I saved him from a bad life is one of the most amazing feelings I’ve experienced.

I have smiled every day since I’ve had him; how is that not rescuing me?"
