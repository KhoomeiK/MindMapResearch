A friend of mine was like ‚Äúoh no just forget about that and just water them‚Äù but that mostly means they‚Äôll compete with each other, some will die off leading to a lower yield, so eventually, logic dictates we separate them.

What do you have growing?"

I feel like a little of your disconnect here is because you‚Äôve never had that one-on-one ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my human‚Äù bond with a pet, and I agree the ‚Äúmy pet adopted me‚Äù is weird and needs to stop, but I can *totally* relate to when people say their pet rescued or saved them. 

These are living creatures, and although they aren‚Äôt on our level of consciousness and cognizance, they have emotions and convey them in ways words don‚Äôt. They rescue us in the sense that they‚Äôve changed our lives and allowed us to grow in many ways otherwise not possible. The appreciation my dog has for me after I saved him from a bad life is one of the most amazing feelings I‚Äôve experienced.

I have smiled every day since I‚Äôve had him; how is that not rescuing me?"
