NorthropGrumman,fpiexpx,t3_gdnqjz,1588639514.0,"According to my calculations, 37.5%. Good luck."
aliens,fooqk7n,t3_g8lsgj,1587944352.0,It’s very obviously a bright star low on the horizon.
PeopleFuckingDying,fokpm1a,t1_fojid36,1587846535.0,"As an EE student: 

A clock like that doesn’t use a radio signal or anything like that to keep time, it has an internal crystal oscillator. You’re correct about the magnetic fields being created but magnetic fields only really effect circuits that have a lot of inductance. This plasma ball actually generates a significant electric field that would lead to stray voltages all over the PCBs in the clock and I think that is more likely the cause"
astrophotography,fo8m399,t3_g68xjn,1587599236.0,Great job. I love the color. What bortle class is this from?
telescopes,fo7nelr,t3_g66b67,1587581309.0,Get a simple CMOS astronomy camera and a tracking mount if you really want to get something more substantial
ucla,fo5dman,t3_g5rc2d,1587523131.0,"Like the other guy says, k is a vector equivalent to <0,0,1>. So the direction is in the positive z axis and it’s not too unclear"
ucla,fnybrv7,t3_g4j8ks,1587358542.0,What? It looked like this before people moved out too.
space,fnxucij,t3_g4g8wc,1587346513.0,"Wow, coming from the digital world of astrophotography, seeing this stuff on film is unreal. 

I’m amazed you had so much faith in your guiding and your skies to do an entire 80 minutes. Absolutely fantastic work and I hope you really treasure that piece for a long time."

ucla,fnxjd6z,t3_g3tlls,1587339852.0,"It all depends on too many variables to say anything definitively. 

Rejected from Cal for EE."
ucla,fniorkk,t3_g1xzay,1586983697.0,I don’t understand why USAC doesn’t see that they themselves are the ones impeding the progress of black resources on campus by not holding themselves accountable for the usage of funding and not being able to effectively reallocate funds that aren’t being used.
ucla,fn0ip3b,t1_fmyzdio,1586542663.0,"What if I don’t take money from USAC for clubs/orgs? And I have my own printer, I don’t utilize those study spaces, and I don’t go to Bruin bash. Why do I still have to pay for all of it? And pay more now apparently?"

AerospaceEngineering,fmy7hq3,t1_fmy7ccb,1586479788.0,I cheated. My parents are both engineers.
AerospaceEngineering,fmy706l,t3_fy12qd,1586479481.0,"Hi, I’m an EE Major (close to CE) that was wondering if I wanted to be an AE (I decided on EE because I like signals and circuits more than thermo, statics, and dynamics). I just wanted to let you know that physics follows you everywhere you go in engineering, and depending on your CE program you may find yourself having to do a lot of higher level physics (RF, Pchem, Controls, Optics, Lasers, Semiconductors). My school’s CE is pretty much an EE degree with a little bit more CE. 

However, I also want to say that I pretty much failed Integral Calc 3. I got a 16% on the midterm where the average was a 48% and a similar situation happened on the final. I somehow got a C in the course and it’s still on my transcript. However, I’m now almost done with sophomore year and I used that C as motivation to excel in my other classes and I’ve found that while I didn’t do so hot in math or physics, I really excel in engineering classes. 

One C in college is not a career ender."
