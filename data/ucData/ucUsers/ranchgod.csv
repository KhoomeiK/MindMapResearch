I would share but im slightly worried about doxxing myself as my github has my whole name and stuff... but i might upload it to a dummy github and i would update this comment with the link!

My stuff is probably embarassingly written though, and the terminal is just a restyle of [jquery.terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl)"
