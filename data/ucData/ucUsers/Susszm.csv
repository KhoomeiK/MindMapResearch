This poor baby has had to advocate for herself for so long. And this clip shows that it follows a general trend of black girls being perceived as older than their  peers of the same age. Which means they have to grow up much faster.

I think cuz shes an all American girl next door relatable-ish type? 
Oh and including her also beautiful sister boosted her popularity too


She also had a relationship with another big tiktoker 
So all of that is pretty much how she got elevated.
