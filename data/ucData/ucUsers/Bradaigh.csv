But the Senate means that the unique needs of a person in Wyoming, or Vermont, or South Dakota are far more represented than the unique needs of someone in South Central LA.

Rural people (many of whom are my family, by the way) have needs that would never apply to someone in a big city. But the same is equally true of someone in a big city—there are things that apply to them that simply don't apply to people in rural settings.

Further, the way the Senate is set up means that lots of rural people get lost in the fray. Tons of people in California live in rural settings but they have to share two senators with the metropolises of the coast."

It's true that some can be somewhat sexual, but I would argue they're no more sexualized than cheerleaders or a halftime show. If that's too sexual, fair, but I think it can be easy to see gay activities as much more sexualized than the exact same straight activities, and it's important to keep it in perspective."

Christianity,fmp5jnq,t1_fmp5b7r,1586274833.0,"And then the response:

> In the larger-than-life, spiritually transformed people I have met, I always find one common denominator: in some sense, they have all died before they died. They have followed in the self-emptying steps of Jesus, a path from death to life that Christians from all over the world celebrate this week.

> At some point, such people were led to the edge of their private resources, and that breakdown, which surely felt like dying, led them into a larger life. They broke through in what felt like breaking down. Instead of avoiding a personal death or raging at it, they went through a death of their old, small self and came out the other side knowing that death could no longer hurt them. This process of transformation is known in many cultures as initiation. For many Christians, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus is the preeminent example of this pattern. Following Jesus, we need to trust the down, and God will take care of the up. Although even there, we still must offer our yes.
 
> If the five truths of initiation from last week seemed demanding or negative, I want to also name the energizing source that makes them possible and that becomes their long-term effect. I call these consolations the “common wonderful,” the collective beauty and security that healthy people live within, no matter what words they use for it. Some have called the lessons “the five positive messages""; I am calling them the “five consoling messages.” The “common wonderful” is a cosmic egg of meaning that holds us, helps us grow, and gives us ongoing new birth and beginnings. It is our matrix for life, our underlying worldview, and the energy field that keeps us motivated each day. In some sense it must be held by at least a few people around you, or it is very difficult to sustain absolutely alone. Perhaps such people are “the two or three” gathered in Jesus’ name (Matthew 18:20).
 
> The five consoling messages must be a part of our inner experience, something we know to be true for ourselves, not something we believe because others have told us to. These five messages, which will form the basis of the Daily Meditations this week, can be described using New Testament quotes (although there are similar messages in all the great religious traditions):

> It is true that life is hard, *and yet my yoke is easy and my burden is light* (Matthew 11:28).  
> It is true that you are not important, *and yet do you not know that your name is written in heaven?* (Luke 10:20).  
> It is true that your life is not about you, *and yet I live now not my own life, but the life of Christ who lives in me* (Galatians 2:20).  
> It is true that you are not in control, *and yet can any of you, for all of your worrying, add a single moment to your span of life?* (Luke 12:26).  
> It is true that you are going to die, *and yet neither death nor life. . . can ever come between us and the love of God* (Romans 8:38-39)."
Christianity,fmp5b7r,t3_fwje9r,1586274708.0,"I found this from Father Richard Rohr really instructive:

> In this time of global crisis, it may be that reality is revealing itself to us—through great suffering—universal patterns that are always true. A little over fifteen years ago, I wrote a book called Adam’s Return that focused on male initiation rites. These are the sacred rituals in indigenous cultures that marked the symbolic growth of a self-referential boy to a generative, compassionate man. While that book was written specifically for men, it seems to me that reality is “initiating” all of us to know and live by these same essential truths. This week I will be trying to present this global crisis as a global initiation into what matters and what lasts.  Now women need this essential initiation just as much as men. 

> The work of sacred rituals like initiation was to situate life in a bigger frame, so nature, beauty, suffering, work, sexuality, and ordinary moments were seen to have transcendent significance. They gave life meaning— the one thing the soul cannot live without. Heaven and earth have to be put together or this world never becomes home. That integration is the necessary human and spiritual task, at which initiation rites succeeded, probably on a much broader scale than modern churches.  

> Initiation was always, in some form, an experience of the tension and harmony of opposites: of loss and renewal, darkness and light, the cycle of seasons, death and resurrection, yin and yang, the paschal mystery. Somehow initiates had to see the wide screen and, at least for a moment, find goodness and meaning in what was offered right in front of them, which is all we can love anyway. Universally, early cultures insisted on large doses of separation, silence, looking, listening, and various kinds of suffering.  

> In my cross-cultural research on male initiation rites, I perceived five consistent lessons or truths communicated to the initiate, meant to separate initiates from their attachment to who they think they are and reattach them to who they really are.  

> In this time of global disruption, these lessons can help us align to reality, our own belonging in it, and remain grounded in the infinitely trustworthy presence of God.  

> These five essential messages of initiation are:  

> Life is hard.  
> You are not important.  
> Your life is not about you.  
> You are not in control.  
> You are going to die.

>You may be shocked by the seemingly negative character of these five truths. Most Western postmodern people are, but there’s no way around these truths, hard as they may be.  In fact, one could say much of the superficiality of our world is because we stopped growing up men. We will be exploring these five lessons in this week’s Daily Meditations and their positive spiritual counterparts the following week. None of this is easy work. We typically want to flee from our current anxiety, grief and pain, but I encourage you to stay with these messages. They are truths for your soul that can help you find meaning and a sense of God’s compassionate presence inside of the chaos."
