berkeley,fon8pfm,t1_fomewuq,1587914630.0,"One thing about Weaver is that he is a culture guy and has a strong work ethic, both of which bode well towards making it into the roster. Ultimately training camp and preseason will determine his fate"
berkeley,folo4jd,t1_folc9ij,1587866527.0,"The problem is going to be his pass coverage and speed. Weaver is the perfect linebacker for an earlier era, but his game might not translate well in the modern NFL. Only time will tell."
berkeley,fo32z9j,t1_fo31g2k,1587479560.0,"You can get out of R&C courses with a 5 on AP Lit, but a 4 will only get you out of the 1A requirement not the 1B requirement. 

A 3 or higher on your Calc exam can get you out of quantitative reasoning, though most people I know got that taken care of with their SAT and ACT score. A 3 or higher will, more importantly, get you out of Math 1A which is a lower div pre-req for CS.

A 3 or higher on your Spanish exam can get you out of the foreign language requirement but I'm guessing if you are taking AP Spanish that you probably have taken the minimum three years of a foreign language which satisfies the requirement regardless.

Other than that you are shit out of luck. Welcome to Berkeley where your AP Credits don't mean shit."

berkeley,fo2zzxc,t1_fo2ce7a,1587477874.0,"Yes, but IIRC your odds of getting in are pretty low. Take the on-campus housing you're offered and just eat the cost."

GlobalOffensive,fn80fl5,t1_fn7zyx3,1586731318.0,"They did, but it's pretty close either way. Depends on how quickly NAF recognizes he needs to get up catwalk, how far past the CT was etc would ultimately determine the round. Probably a bit overstated to say round over, but I doubt he clutches it if he doesn't get all three there."
GlobalOffensive,fn7z1tz,t3_g067qe,1586730517.0,"The timing on this is insane, if one player is just slightly past the CT gap, its round over."

GlobalOffensive,flpfwaq,t1_flos3e0,1585358531.0,"Obviously Team Liquid has fallen off, but this is a little misleading IMO. There have only been three LANs in the last four months, and at Katowice Liquid lost to both of the eventual finalists and placed second at Blast Global Finals. Only BLAST spring series can be considered a big disappointment, everything else isn't that bad. TL definitely needs to elevate their play but they haven't fallen off the edge of the competitive scene like MIBR"
