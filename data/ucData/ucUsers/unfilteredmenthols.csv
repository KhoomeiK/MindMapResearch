prius,fnk7jw6,t1_fniolvj,1587017363.0,"Replacing the capacitor was the first thing I ever soldered, and my '07 with 190k is doing just fine 8 months and 5,000 miles later. No experience with anything, just a 19-year-old that looked at a few youtube videos. 

Definitely worth doing it yourself. So long as you make a good contact spot with tweezers and make sure not to melt the capacitor with your soldering iron (which shouldn't be a problem since most capacitors you get come in sets of 10) then you'll come out the other end with soldering experience and a few hundred more dollars than if you went to a shop."
