You seem to still be under the impression that political organizations act to further the benefit of their nominal members or constituents.   Boy, that's really 20th Century of you.   Her Majesty has paid all of these people handsomely to laugh at you."
RPI,fpmnjtp,t3_geb045,1588737063.0,"hahahaha.

You thought that Her Majesty would give back money?

That's so cute."
RPI,fpjnk83,t3_gd2xu8,1588675109.0,"Her Majesty thanks you for your donation to her retirement fund, and for the lovely deck in her second mansion that your contributions have allowed her to install.   At present, she plans to offer those who are unable to continue their degree plans the unique opportunity to scrub the floors of her vacation homes for a fair wage.   Assuming, of course, that you're prepared to work in a hazmat suit to avoid contaminating the air that her eminence breathes."
RPI,fp4x2wg,t1_fp4l1aj,1588309683.0,"You can hide an elephant in the vagueness of ""related to.""

Title IX is an anti-discrimination statute, and it has the force of statutory law, not that of a constitutional guarantee.   It is ""related to"" the 14th Amendment only in the sense that Congress' authority to regulate in this area also derives, in part, from the enforcement clause of the 14th Amendment.   (As a technical matter, the Supreme Court has ruled that Title IX derives from the Spending Clause of Article I, not the 14th Amendment.)  The protections of Title IX are not constitutional rights.

More importantly, the whole notion that Title IX affords an appropriate vehicle for pursuing or examining assault claims is somewhat misguided.   Title IX states:

>“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”

Trying to use the ""subjected to discrimination under any education program"" language to address criminal assault is inefficient at best, and likely to lead to poor results in many cases.   Because Title IX is targeted at the school itself, and not the conduct of third parties, the school's responsibility does not arise until and unless it has specific knowledge of misconduct and then displays ""deliberate indifference"" to severe and pervasive misconduct.   (*See, e.g., Davis*, 526 U.S. 629 (1999)).  Thus, schools are motivated to create ""process"" (which is the opposite of ""indifference""), not necessarily to achieve prevention.

The short version is that anyone who is the victim of criminal assault should treat it as a criminal matter, and pursue remedies through the legal process, not the school process.   In some circumstances it is appropriate to also pursue action by the school, but that should be viewed as a supplement, not a substitute."
RPI,fniut4h,t1_fn3qp89,1586986741.0,"No, contacting a NY state representative will accomplish nothing.  ""Voicing complaints"" accomplishes nothing.   Online petitions accomplish nothing.   Grow up.   You don't live in the world of President Sanders.   Yelling loudly means squat.

Now, actual concerted action to withhold tuition by 50-75% of the student body would actually hurt the school.   In a big way if you accomplish it in the next 5 weeks before the refi of the bond issuance closes on June 3.   But that's very, very different from ""contacting your representative."""
RPI,fniu5ms,t1_fnbopjs,1586986413.0,"The students are almost certainly located in South Carolina, so their lawyers felt that filing in the ""home court"" was advantageous."
RPI,fnity1h,t1_fnc7rr8,1586986308.0,"More importantly, a force majeure clause is basically a defense to performance.   (i.e., the school cannot perform its obligation to offer campus events and classes due to superseding causes.)    It is not a justification for keeping the money.   

By way of example, if someone pays you $50,000 to deliver goods on April 15 at a certain place, and -- unexpectedly -- a war breaks out and you are unable to deliver the goods, a force majeure defense would insulate you from consequential damages for breach of contract.   But if the buyer paid the $50,000 in advance, you cannot keep the money while not delivering the goods."
UCSC,fnipqyr,t1_fnihqr5,1586984196.0,"Not sure that is correct.  UC bought the land from the SH Cowell Foundation in 1961.  The issue is not the terms of the land sale, but rather the ""Master Agreement"" and long range development plan that was used in negotiations with the City, Thus, the issue is more akin to traditional city zoning rules and regs than actual ownership restrictions.    And all of the City issues could be disregarded in a moment if the legislature simply acted to overrule the City on a state basis (since UC is a state agency, and the state can simply preempt City regs)."
RPI,fnfjllr,t3_g0ehfd,1586909320.0,"Her Majesty has done little to speak of, beyond spending Curtis Priem's multi-millions on pet projects.   She's killed the school financials, and ruined alumni support.   Other than that, spot on."

RPI,fmowkw7,t3_fvksgp,1586269903.0,"Sorry -- my schedule is already filled up with the ""Tilting At Windmills"" group, and the ""Shouting About Stuff I Don't Understand"" group."
RPI,fm9rkcc,t1_fm14n8t,1585874969.0,"In 2019, RPI ran about $14M in the black on gross revenue of $465M -- a margin of less than 3%.   Non-tuition student revenue was $63M.  If the school refunded 1/4 of non-tuition student revenue last year, it would have been in the red for the year.   A loss of that much revenue is going to squeeze the school a bit.  

It takes time of come up with enough BS to fill that kind of a financial hole."
