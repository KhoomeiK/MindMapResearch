PhD,fpgmtty,t3_gdb9y9,1588605742.0,"Don’t worry about it, this is absolutely part of the research process.  Acknowledge it, learn from it, and keep on going.  I’ve seen some grad students spend almost a year trying to replicate an experimental artifact, so, at least you caught it early :)"
AskDrugNerds,foylng7,t3_gaau01,1588174736.0,"Well, I guess because I didn’t want help.  Drugs weren’t negatively affecting my life or relationships.  If anything they were helping, as I have had issues my whole life, and my drug exploration helped me discover a lot about myself.  Ultimately, drugs inspired me to study science, and here I am today, doing pretty well, and I thank drugs for that.  The reason why I don’t experiment with new substances these days is because I’m simply too busy.  I would like to reconnect to that old excitement, but between balancing the management of a PhD, a biotech startup, taking care of adult responsibilities, and dedicating time to nurture my relationships with family, friends, and my SO, I just don’t have time to get high.  With that being said, I do drink beer late at night when I finally finish my work, because if I don’t, then I’ll just stay up all night feeling stressed about how I should start the next task that I have on my plate, and the beer kind of partitions work time and relaxation/self-care time.  However, this consumption of alcohol is definitely a daily thing, so to an outsider’s perspective, maybe I am still an addict, and I’m just hooked on stress and legal drugs these days."

AdviceAnimals,foup1sf,t3_g9etku,1588088019.0,I have never heard of someone doing this.  It’s nice if there’s a fan to cover the noise though.
AskAcademia,fol0dby,t3_g7xdvy,1587852402.0,"Just dropped in to say that I’m doing the same thing.  My program was not as good of a fit as I thought it would be, and I’ll be transferring to a new school in the fall.  Idk what will happen down the road, but whatever, life weird yo"

berkeley,fohn7u8,t3_g7ghw3,1587768829.0,"Same here!  The cc route was the way to go!  Saved tons of money, and many of the classes that I took at cc were better than those at Berkeley.  Once I transferred, I was super prepared, and even ended up returning to berkeley for a Masters a year after graduation.  Many of my friends from cc also transferred to Berkeley, and we are all super stoked about the path that brought us to where we are now.  Enjoy it :)"
biotech,fofwgcj,t3_g7arhd,1587744017.0,"Does your school offer chemical biology classes?  If so, those should provide insight to the mechanistic nature of biochemical processes, and clever ways to manipulate them.  
Naturally, programming classes would definitely be important."
TheeHive,fofv8pz,t1_foft2av,1587743418.0,Was kidding; most PhD level chemists would still struggle with LSD synthesis.

TheeHive,fnvtlvp,t3_g46loz,1587304420.0,Just wanted to say that this kind of curiosity is awesome :) happy journey!
materials,fnunal7,t3_g3zmoe,1587266205.0,"Wow, I definitely know what you mean.  I was a chem major in undergrad (with an emphasis in biotech applications), and for some strange reason decided to do a PhD in Materials Science... without taking a single materials science class in undergrad.  MSE is cool; I’m way more into the E&M aspects as well.  However, the mechanical aspects, failure analysis, product performance, etc. really turn me off, and as a result, I am currently trying to change departments for my PhD.  You could probably find an emphasis within MSE that fits your interest, but there will be some uninteresting class requirements along the way, as is the case in any major.  Have you looked into computational materials or nanotechnology?  An emphasis like that might have a focus on the things that you’re interested in."
AskReddit,fnc6mk6,t3_g0hraa,1586829736.0,"“What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.”"

Say, for someone who has a PhD in a branch of science/engineering, which department has a good growth trajectory while allowing your work to stay focused on dealing with actual scientific problems?"
