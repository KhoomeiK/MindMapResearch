ucla,fn0i5a2,t1_fn09r2m,1586542373.0,"Thatâ€™s obviously bad, but there are always gonna be bad and lazy professors regardless if classes are online or not. A few bad apples doesnâ€™t justify sweeping changes"
ucla,fn08415,t3_fyaxfq,1586537141.0,"This is tough because youâ€™re basically implying that professors and admin should be paid less. Professors are still teaching class and offering OH, etc., and if anything admin has probably been working overtime amid this virus, so I donâ€™t see this actually going through. Maybe smaller campus fees here and there can get dropped obviously, but overall I donâ€™t see tuition costs going down"
