playstation,fotudtt,t3_g9aj3t,1588066460.0,It's especially difficult to avoid the internet during quarantine. This really sucks. June 19 needs to come sooner.

berkeley,fo5d0be,t3_g5hni6,1587522724.0,"Major: Mechanical Engineering

What college you are transferring from: Skyline College

Hobbies: Driving, working on my car, video games, writing, listening to music, playing guitar, sim racing, breaking things apart so I can put it back together, Lego building, hot wheels collecting.

Random (Born in a different country, speak a different language, skills, student with a disability, anything else that makes you different): Raised in the Philippines for 6 years but born in the US, so that makes my fluent in both English and Tagalog. I'm probably also gonna be older than a significant portion of students at Cal.

Can't wait to start at Cal! Go Bears!"
EngineeringStudents,fnrdiau,t1_fnquigg,1587185752.0,"I was very lucky to have participated in a program called NASA Community College Aerospace Scholars (NCAS). I met my mentor during the program and kept in touch with him, he offered me a spot on his team, and it turned into a paid internship in the summer."
EngineeringStudents,fn23j8i,t1_fn22tal,1586576887.0,"Best of luck to you too. To be honest, me neither, but what else am I gonna do with all this free time."
EngineeringStudents,fn20bec,t1_fn1v87x,1586574525.0,I'm gonna finish up my application for that one this weekend. A lot of my former colleagues got into jobs/internships over the past year.
CivicSi,fn0rdvp,t3_fym86f,1586547299.0,"Yooo, what are those wheels? They look dope! Especially on a white Si.

I got a blue one, so I'm still figuring out what wheels go best with blue.

Edit: Just figured out you have a 2020. I wonder if I can find those rims sold separately."
EngineeringStudents,fn0r3pp,t3_fyhjm5,1586547146.0,"For a while, yeah. But everyone's been sending out their ""Internship Program Postponed/Cancelled"" emails lately so I've started to not bother anymore."
civic,fmvldse,t3_fxoqgi,1586421230.0,"Felt the urge to finally post because I left a comment in r/cars and my user flair didn't update, so got downvoted pretty hard over there. Went from a 2012 EX to a 2017 Si. She's also my first manual and I'm loving every second behind the wheel.

Also, since the warranty was already used up by the previous owner, I'm about to make some bad decisions. Anyway, where should I start? I was thinking about the front plate. The previous owner didn't drill the holes so I might keep it that way. Also, I wanna start taking better photos of my car.

Wanted to originally post in r/CivicSi too."

cars,fmt5eck,t3_fx59a6,1586367139.0,"Yay, my car made the list!

Edit: Flair didn't update when I posted. I upgraded to a 2017 Si recently."
