baseball,fpjke3w,t3_gdts0n,1588671814.0,"I've been to a KBO game, and you really can't understand what cheering/singing along with the crowd is like unless you've BEEN THERE yourself. Every player has his own song, so you and everyone around you will be singing, then you hear the bat crack and see it soaring to the walls and the singing turns into roars. You can no longer hear the speakers or the cheermaster's whistle because the crowd drowns it out. This change is just like the ""Cueto"" right when Martin hit the HR."

The100,fpenx5e,t1_fpel8i1,1588551218.0,I agree. Even for those who run away from it all (Luna and her Flokru).
The100,fpcbvhv,t1_fpcbn4i,1588494718.0,"In a way, I see similarities between Clarke and Echo too. Doing what's best for their people out of good intentions, only to go unrecognized and get blamed.

This sub likes to say that Roan and Lexa were the only two who were able to understand Clarke, but I would argue that Echo can as well. I'd love to see the two interact in S7."
The100,fpc9x26,t1_fpc9rsy,1588492688.0,I wish my post got more popular simply due to the fact that I want more people to see your comment. Thank you for this.
The100,fpc97tx,t1_fpc8g0i,1588491975.0,"I agree! I understand that this time jump makes fans believe that Bellarke is much more believable and realistic, but they forget to consider that 6 years is a lot longer than the [3 months](https://the100.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline) Bellamy and Clarke interacted with each other."
The100,fpc7w1m,t3_gcmdup,1588490610.0,"I forgot to say...this is why Becho makes sense to me. I've read posts saying that Becho formed from nothing but boredom and having nothing to do on the ship, but I believe that their relationship goes much further than this.

When Bellamy stopped Echo from killing herself, he showed her that she belonged, not to a clan or kin, but in the sense that there are people who care about her. We don't see what happens in the next six years, but Bellamy clearly shows that he's willing to help Echo and show her that that she's valuable because she's human, not because she's loyal to some clan.

I'd compare this to how Murphy and Emori's relationship started with him accepting Emori when she thought of herself as worthless due to her defect (""I don't think you should cover it. I think it looks badass"")."
