trashy,fpd51ox,t1_fpd46sk,1588519984.0,"When they returned to their hotel on Aug. 30, Daniel J. Carney’s wife-to-be asked him to walk a friend inside. The 29-year-old Oregon woman had been too drunk to keep her balance on her paddle board, the Morning Call reported, and as Carney walked her down the hallway, she swayed and struggled to stay upright.
Suddenly, Carney pulled the woman into the men’s locker room. Then, police say, the groom led the woman to the showers, where he forcibly grabbed her, bit her and removed her bikini bottoms.
Then the bride walked in.

If you arrived on April 2019 and saw it like this you would you think “Aw it’s packed, going to be hard to find a good spot” because you can see people in every direction. 

More importantly, it is sufficiently full to warrant shock and outrage because people are obviously close enough and in sufficient numbers to spread the virus to each other while the rest of the nation shelters in place and avoids even seeing loved ones in person.

Or is the issue here that the producers also have nowhere to store it and will begin to incur costs due to the speculators being unable to take possession as they promised, therefore they could file a lawsuit for breach of contract and show the damages (whatever it's costing them to keep oil that had sold)."

His point is that it’s not about what anyone believes, it’s about what evidence there will be afterward. if there’s actual evidence of a false reporting then of course that woman should go to prison. for example video of her boasting about the false report or video showing that the encounter was consensual, actual tangible evidence that could be used in court to prove she lied. this would exclude from prosecution all women that simply report an incident but don’t have enough evidence to prove rape happened. So long as their rapist cannot  evidence the accusation was false because it doesn’t exist, these women would not be convicted."

It seems to me like the lack of preparedness the lack of personal protection equipment and the lack of medical equipment needed for this crisis could’ve just as easily occurred under a Medicare for all system if the government agencies in charge failed to stockpile. My understanding for example is in California the state was previously well-equipped to handle this scenario but failed to resupply its stockpile of ventilators and PPE after the last crisis, and that’s with the current private health insurance system / millions uninsured. 

Or are you saying that under the current system those infected will face financial ruin for the medical care they receive?"
