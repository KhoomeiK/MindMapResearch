AmItheAsshole,fokofkj,t3_g7swpo,1587845894.0,"NTA. You should have some say in this as well because although she‚Äôs his blood, you are part of the family too. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong of him to want to take care of her but I think realistically it just isn‚Äôt possible with your living condition with all of your kids. 

I used to work as an aide for a woman with cerebral palsy and I enjoyed it a lot but at the same time that was my job and I was getting paid with lots of training and preparation. It‚Äôs definitely not easy, and requires a lot of cooperation and an open mind from everyone involved. My client was 28 and lost control of a lot of her muscles so she couldn‚Äôt eat, walk, or do very much on her own but what helped a lot was that she retained all her cognitive ability and was verbal. (It took a few weeks to understand her speech though since she didn‚Äôt have good control of those muscles and her tongue). It sounds like your sister in law may require even more assistance since she cannot express her needs as well and she should be in the hands of someone trained and familiar with her condition. Your husband has a good heart for offering to take her in, but with your kids and your space it might not be a good fit for your SIL either. 

Definitely sit down and have a serious conversation with your husband about how realistic this all is. There are other ways to take care of her and depending on what country you live in the government may be able to provide some financial assistance for her situation. (Two different agencies paid me with a small bonus from the family of the woman I worked with). Best of luck and I hope your family is staying safe!"
vaginismus,fokiday,t3_g7rore,1587842621.0,For me no. It would really depend on your situation.  Having a really supportive partner helps a lot and take the pressure off. For some people the issue is with the emotional convection and problems with intimacy with a specific person but usually the situation is a lot more nuanced than that.
vaginismus,fnpwtfc,t1_fnn202q,1587153437.0,"But I do agree that it‚Äôs completely possible to have romantic relationships. I‚Äôve thought that I had progress for a partner in the past but that didn‚Äôt work out for anyone. 

Now I‚Äôve been with my partner for over a year and I‚Äôve never felt more supported and loved. We‚Äôve only had somewhat successful PIV once or twice but he‚Äôs never pressured me into doing anything for him."
vaginismus,fnpwhy7,t1_fnn202q,1587153273.0,"Not that I disagree with you completely, but I think it could be possible that he just has a limited worldview of sex and satisfaction. I think a lot of people see PIV as the end all be all. In reality, many people aren‚Äôt able to finish with PIV and even prefer non penetrative sex.

I think it‚Äôs definitely possible to have a healthy conversation about your expectations and goals and how you can best meet both your needs. He needs to understand that you‚Äôre trying your best (whether that means getting physical therapy or just being okay with where you‚Äôre at now). If he still isn‚Äôt willing to have an open mind about things, then it might be time to re-evaluate things. Don‚Äôt let anyone put any extra pressure on you because that‚Äôs the worst thing with this condition."
vaginismus,fnn5f9f,t3_g2o9u6,1587084799.0,"To be quite honest, I‚Äôve been in this situation in the past and it hasn‚Äôt worked out. I think you need to both sit down and talk about this issues seriously as adults (virtually since we‚Äôre in quarantine unless you live together). 

He needs to understand that you are doing everything you can and that he may not have PIV with you anytime soon. If he can‚Äôt accept that, then it‚Äôs time to move on because you deserve more respect than that. Your needs are just as important and if he also does not put in the effort to please you then it‚Äôs not a two way street. 

Good luck and don‚Äôt settle for less. We don‚Äôt deserve any less than people who DON‚ÄôT have vaginismus."
berkeley,fncyi72,t3_g0x9tu,1586851728.0,I can smell this picture
htgawm,fn63hs8,t1_fn63g9x,1586685961.0,"Haha true, maybe some foreshadowing ü§´ü§î"
htgawm,fn605fq,t1_fn5tq7x,1586682272.0,I said this to my friend earlier too haha but I agree. It‚Äôs kinda similar to how Laurel kept claiming Wes was the love of her life. Literally these people barely started confessing their feelings after spending all this time together how are they so eager to profess their love so deeply LMAO
htgawm,fn5syht,t1_fn5sy5d,1586674806.0,Thanks
Scandal,fmue5cs,t1_fmt5u3p,1586389628.0,Me too. I was more than happy to see them get killed off pretty quickly!!
Scandal,fmue3xm,t1_fmudpdj,1586389605.0,Samantha‚Äôs over-exaggerated expressions and voice just made her so unattractive to me HAHA Peus just seemed like he tried so hard to sound evil it was almost comical. Not a fan of either one and I was relieved when they got killed off rather quickly!! ü§£
Scandal,fmudzq7,t1_fmt874y,1586389539.0,"Same, I really didn‚Äôt understand what made them scarier than anyone else. I still don‚Äôt know how everyone was coerced into helping them. Like okay you have information to blackmail people on? You can kill people? So what? So could basically anyone else in the show lol... Charlie was interesting because we never knew whose side he was on and he was unpredictable."
Scandal,fmrotty,t1_fmrop14,1586330083.0,I 100% agree. He is emotionally and sometimes even physically abusive and manipulative and it gets pretty scary when he‚Äôs angry. He definitely has many power trips and very few redeeming qualities :/ There really are no perfect characters in this show although I‚Äôd say David Rosen was as close as it got to being a good man.
Scandal,fmrok2r,t1_fmrocw0,1586329815.0,"She was the head of the FBI. Liv took her out to a dinner in order to distract her so that Quinn and Charlie could break into her office and Liv tried to stall Angela by asking her what she thought of Fitz and giving her the okay to ask him out. Up until then Angela Webster was pretty irrelevant to me, but somehow ended up dating Fitz for a bit right after. Idk why that bothered me so much but maybe because I just wanted to believe Fitz and Liv were still meant to be but that man really just could not control his hormones üòîI have lost hope for him."
Scandal,fmrfqh1,t1_fmrdr0d,1586321880.0,HAHAHAHAHA thanks
