ApplyingToCollege,fpjf2hq,t3_gdrzzg,1588666148.0,"Honestly, you don't need to. I applied to maybe 14, and looking back I wish I had applied to less. And I don't think this is a bad question haha, junior year I didn't know a thing about applying to college and might've asked the same. Anyways:

For one, applications cost money. Applying to 45+ schools could be hundreds of dollars. I don't know if money is an issue for you, but it really would be a lot. 

Second, as others have mentioned you would have to write essays for all of them. Some college applications will have overlap, but a lot don't. College application season is a pretty stressful time, and I already felt swamped with my 14 applications. Also, the applications themselves are annoying to deal with, each one takes a considerable amount of time. There's files to upload, transcripts to send, test scores to input. It's a lot to manage, even if you start early.

Third, really think about these schools and ask yourself if you could imagine yourself going there or if you would even want to. I understand wanting to apply to safeties and reaches, but I low-key regretted applying to too many of those. Not because I didn't get in, but because even if I did I knew I didn't really want to go there. Big name ""reach"" schools seem appealing, but you can get a good education and opportunities elsewhere.

And sort of related to the last point, schools like to see a student that wants something from that school specifically. They want an applicant that can contribute their skills to that school itself. You want to dedicate time and research into each of your choices to know what kind of students they cater to and if you're that type of person. There are non-academic things to think about as well, like location, housing, social life, clubs, etc. Maybe you apply to a prestigious school in a place that snows but you actually hate cold weather. That stuff is really important.

I would recommend first coming up with a list of the things you're looking for in college, then finding which colleges match up with that. It'll hopefully narrow down your list into schools that you're more passionate about and applications that are more manageable. I'd say 20 is the upper limit for how many schools to apply to.

Sorry for the long response, and good luck in this process!"

What class are you in right now? The best thing to do would be to buy launchpad immediately, you need it for the whole LS series."

ucla,foj0t4z,t3_g7p818,1587803897.0,"Yeah, I think most people feel the same. And it's okay to feel unmotivated and lost right now. Even if your life isn't in immediate peril, this is still a scary and uncertain situation we are all in. It's changed so many aspects of our lives and is in the backs of our minds, it would be weird if we didn't act/feel differently than normal. It sucks that school is just business as usual which has made me feel like I shouldn't have these feelings and just toughen up. But the other part of me says, hey, we're in the middle of a pandemic, it's okay to be out of it."
ucla,fo9crs9,t1_fo99lh8,1587616035.0,"I'm also a life science major and the ls30 series is recommended for us. You can also take math 31, but it is less relevant. Ls30 is way easier conceptually than math 31, math 31B was the hardest class I've ever taken and I'm not really bad at math either. If you have the choice to do ls30....do it you will suffer less. And from my understanding they will teach you to code so you don't need experience."
ucla,fo4w555,t3_g5mhv5,1587512386.0,"For the labs in 23L we're doing online modules. One was a pipetting simulation which looked like a video game so that was kind of cool. There's definitely more flexibility as you can complete the labs over several days, but part of me wonders if there's more work since some labs have definitely taken me longer than 3 hours to complete (or maybe I'm just slow and distracted).

I'm not missing the in person lab, being online isn't too much of a problem for this class surprisingly."
ucla,fo4vs0v,t1_fo4hsub,1587512185.0,"I'm taking 7c right now, and although the content isn't harder, there's just so much more of it. There is so much memorization of all these physiological terms. If it takes you a while to memorize things, just know you'll be spending lots of time on it."
ucla,fnt97ey,t3_g3kuno,1587237054.0,"When you search for roommates you can rate your preferences about things like drinking, how late they stay up, etc. There's also a facebook page and numerous group chats where you can find roommates which I'd recommend more. Find someone with similar values to you and you won't have a problem. Just don't go with random roommates."

Then pretty much all of Winter quarter is cold where hoodies are a must. Idk about spring but I imagine it's something like fall in reverse. I see plenty of people wearing them so you won't have to abandon anything :)"
