internetparents,fntqhkw,t1_fntq24p,1587246810.0,"hmm, I see what you mean. I wouldn’t think about it too hard. I’m sure she would be grateful for any sort of thanks you could give. I myself graduated high school last year as well and was in the exact same shoes as you were and the usually approach to family friends is just to thank them and move on."
internetparents,fntpvap,t3_g3vg9o,1587246481.0,"Just thank her normally, I’ve been put into those awkward positions before as well and usually no one will care if you just give her a genuine thanks. As for what to do with the money if you really want to get rid of it maybe donate it? I’m sure there are many organizations that would accept the money! Good luck and stay safe."

UCSC,fls0ryy,t3_fqnaat,1585431924.0,"I love the school, the campus is beautiful and I miss it dearly right now. It's really easy to complain about the school and the problems it has but damn I wish I didn't have to be home for spring quarter."
