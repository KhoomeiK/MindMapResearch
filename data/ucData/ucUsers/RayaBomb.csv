He isn’t the one making his daughter lunches so why should he automatically receive the credit?"
ucr,fpe76ap,t3_gcy59o,1588541712.0,"Honestly, don’t worry. You already said it yourself- you took the quiz on a Friday. You waited past the day it was due and spoke about it on a Sunday. If people want to accuse you of cheating then they’re just going to be wrong about it because timestamps conclude otherwise. I wouldn’t engage with those people anymore, you don’t need to prove it to them because YOU know you didn’t cheat. And the TA should know it to if they look at when you submitted it vs when you talked about it. Just as the other comment said, take screenshots and send those to your TA, both of the quiz time stamp (or if you have an email that just says you submitted it) and the groupme messages."
ucr,fom36y3,t3_g879tk,1587877057.0,"It’s not your fault. Sounds like it’s all on her end. 
I would just send an email that says you know the oral exams make up most of the grade for the class, that you’ve attempted to reach her both for the original meetings and the rescheduled one and there was no response, and ask for another reschedule. 
She should accommodate you since it’s her error, not yours."

The original wife was weird too but glad she moved on somehow"

I had to go to your other post to get some insight on what you were talking about and oh my god, Financial Aid (in this case, f- aid) hasn’t helped you at all- 
Their responses to your appeal and all the documents you’ve given them, they’re absolutely incompetent. I read that as long as you have two letters you should be good, and you’ve given them three. I’ve had my share of incidents with them, but they’re throwing you through a loop and for three years- like damn. 

I would try to get into contact with different advisors/counselors under the finaid@ucr.edu email. I know it’s tiring, but explain all the documents you’ve given to them and your appeal getting rejected. Ask them what else are you meant to provide them if you have no contact with your parents. Emphasize the legitimate no contact. It’s probably what you’ve done, but keep pressuring them with emails.

Maybe try to address an email to one of the directors as well, just to say that you are not receiving solid advice on how to proceed. 

Keep pushing. It seems endless, but it has to get resolved. You’re going to make them resolve it for you because that’s their job. 

You’re doing everything you can and that’s admirable."

College experiences are different for everyone. I feel out of it sometimes, too, but it’s not a bad thing. I don’t have many friends, and it’s hard to socialize, especially now. Don’t let yourself fall into that feeling though. Enjoy your moments, no matter how small or how “alone” you are, because there’ll be a time when you can be among a group again. The whole boyfriend thing- happens when it happens- and friends will stick if they want to. Lol, you’re allowed to be dramatic, I think even more so because quarantine is getting to all of us. I’d say distract yourself with a hobby- and don’t compare yourself to others. You’re gonna be okay. Life moves on."

I have three classes and I wish I had four so I could drop this pos class."
