UCI,ekzewcs,t1_ekze00s,1555374528.0,"Being completely honest, yes I am afraid to debate, not because I'm afraid of my dear ideas being challenged, but because I'm afraid I won't fairly represent the people on my ""side"". I don't want to be the face or strawman of my beliefs and I believe there are people who are more willing to debate. I feel ashamed to admit it, but I used to believe in some of the same rhetoric as the alt-right, but through many experiences I began to challenge these beliefs. I'm still going through this self-discovery so I don't think I'm all too qualified to debate compared to others here. However I can say for certain he had these alt-right seeds planted in his head. 

On the surface value, it did mark liberally biased professors in order to warn people of diverse political beliefs as you said. However whether it was an intentional side effect or not, a lot of the professors on the list have been consistently sent death threats and other forms of harassment."
