I believe Trump's thought-process by Tweeting ""liberate"" is to appeal to those who are strong defenders of the constitution. If it wasn't for the, you know, pandemic thing going around, it would be very unconstitutional and authoritarian for the state to prohibit their citizens from accessing the public.

I'm hoping, as u/ClockOfTheLongNow said, that what Trump meant is the easing of public access and not the complete cancellation of social distancing orders. But hopefully, both sides can see why the other side might have misinterpreted the situation."
