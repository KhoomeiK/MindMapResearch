AskPhysics,fpdheg5,t1_fp8ir1m,1588527032.0,"I think technicolor is pretty strongly disfavored/ruled out. All evidence we have points to an elementary Higgs.

Yes, the inflaton field would have a particle associated with it. It would be incredibly weakly coupled with standard model matter though in order for inflation to work properly."
AskPhysics,fpddn80,t3_gcsvnk,1588524928.0,"the problem with this idea is that the magnetic force (assuming long-range dipole-dipole interactions) drops off like 1/r^(4), meaning the force gets incredibly weak the _further_ away you get from your source magnet. An elastic bungee rope, on the other hand, probably obeys something close to Hooke's law, so the restorative force actually _increases_ the further away you get.

This means that you would need to fine-tune the strength of your magnets so that  it is strong enough such that the potential energy well is deep enough that you wouldn't overshoot give your initial kinetic energy, but weak enough so that you would actually be able to fall a decent distance to make it fun. I am not confident that you would be able to find such a parameter range. Also you would probably slam into the magnet on your return with a fairly high velocity.

With a rope, you don't need to worry about any of that. Just make sure it's strong enough that the person doesn't hit the ground, and you're golden.

EDIT: I made an interactive graph based on a rough estimate that you can play around with [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/akbnkkndac). M(r) is the potential energy curve for your magnet idea, R(r) is the curve for a normal bungee, k is the spring constant for the bungee, u is the magnetic dipole strength, m is the person's mass, and g/u_0 are fixed constants (gravitational acceleration and magnetic permeability).

As you can see, for the bungee, a person will initially accelerate downwards because R'(r) is negative, but will then eventually experience a restorative force that will pull them back to the top of their jump. For the magnetic thing, you will need to initially shoot the person out of a cannon, because the attractive force is stronger than gravity for the entire trip, and they will constantly be decelerating... except if they have enough initial kinetic energy to get over that hump, then gravity overpowers the magnet and they start free-falling (and presumably die)."

Some of my most impressive projects were done at work because I had so much time to work on them (hundreds/thousands of hours); it feels unfortunate to have to summarize all that work in a single bullet."
statistics,fpcxiwj,t3_gcqjg3,1588515222.0,"I actually have a similar question so maybe I'll post it alongside yours if you don't mind... I have worked on many interesting projects and written a lot of great code for my employer, but it is all proprietary, so I can't post it online for obvious reasons. How does one share this experience without actually posting the code? Am I limited to just adding a bullet point to my resume?"
AskPhysics,fp7dj70,t1_fp70haq,1588368601.0,"Yes, some of my work involved potential ramifications of the inflaton (more precisely, if it was possible that the field formed ""lumps"" that would collapse into black holes).

That's the pretty standard analogy; the Higgs field's potential energy surface supposedly looks kind of like a sombrero, with a peak in the center, and then a circular valley around the base. The vacuum state prefers to be at the bottom because it is the lowest energy configuration, like you said.

A lot of my research looked at what would happen if you tweaked the potential so that the outer walls became less steep. Typically this caused solitons (aka ""lumps"") to form because it didn't cost as much energy for the field value (the ""ball"" in your example) to make large excursions away from the center of the potential, especially if the field (ball) was charged/had a conserved current (rolling around the center of the potential circularly). There are actually lots of ball-rolling-around-hills analogies that translate pretty well!"
AskPhysics,fp6w69q,t3_gbdekm,1588359638.0,"To add onto /u/Cris_cortes very nice answer, I think that you can also think of it along the same lines as neutrinos, where they have both flavor eigenstates and mass eigenstates. The analogy is not perfect since the neutrino states mix across generations, whereas the charged leptons apparently do not, but when an electron interacts with a W boson it can be said to be in a chirality eigenstate (a state of definite chirality but undefined mass), and when it interacts with the Higgs field it is in a mass eigenstate. The eigenstates of each basis is a mixture/superposition of the eigenstates of the other, as can be seen by examining the projection operators $(1Â±\\gamma\^5)/2$. I believe the appropriate interpretation is that the left/right-handed Weyl spinors are the chirality eigenstates, while the typical particle/antiparticle Dirac spinors are the mass eigenstates.

My research focused more on scalar field theory, so take any advice from me on fermions with a grain of salt though ;)"
AskPhysics,foy01yd,t1_foxi6w0,1588161782.0,"ah, that's very well hidden! I went to the MIT press website earlier to see if I could I could find it there and they made it seem like buying it was the only option. thank you!"

AskPhysics,fot0mky,t3_g9edrd,1588042021.0,"my PhD advisor loaned me this great little book (and I forgot to give it back when I graduated and moved to the other side of the country, so I guess it's mine now) called ""Asymptotic Methods in Analysis"" by N.G. de Bruijn. it's filled with all sorts of great tricks for approximating sums, integrals, differential equations, roots of algebraic equations, etc. Would highly recommend it. I'm sure there are others out there on the same subject (asymptotic analysis or asymptotics is what you're looking for)."
MachineLearning,fon2z87,t1_fom8v40,1587911027.0,"I'm glad the position is paid, but I was more concerned about them taking advantage of you _right now_, during the interview process.

this seems like overkill for an intern position. when my company was interviewing interns we would send them an assignment that was like ""here's a toy dataset, train a classifier to predict fraudulent transactions"". even then I was worried that might be too much.

your potential employers are asking you to collect and clean the data itself (which is a huge task), then train the classifier in top of that. then you're going to send them this completed project _for free_, just for the chance to get hired. if I was a contractor and someone had hired me to do this, I'd probably charge them several hundred or maybe even up to $1000, depending on how long it took.

I'm just saying that there are other internships out there with much more reasonable interview processes, and it might be better to just keep looking."
MachineLearning,fol6d4p,t3_g7rds0,1587855761.0,"A bit of unsolicited advice: unless you think this is a fairly simple project that you could complete in less than 3-4 hours, just walk away and try and find another internship. This sounds like a classic case of an employer trying to get free work out of interview candidates hungry for positions. Your time is valuable, and unless they're going to pay you for it (whether or not they hire you), it's very likely you might be giving them something that they will turn around and make money off of selling to somebody else, while you never even get a call back because they don't need you anymore. And even if you are hired, their expectations will probably be so high you'll be constantly struggling to stay above water.

Seriously, hiring committees that think it's a good idea to give out interview projects that could be stand-alone projects (gathering/cleaning the data, developing the model, analyzing the predictions) in their own right should all be shot."

AskPhysics,fn3ko09,t3_fz8ir6,1586622663.0,"QM can be expressed almost entirely in linear algebra. However, it is mostly LA in infinite-dimensional spaces (treating continuous functions as vectors) which I doubt your math department's introductory linear algebra courses would cover in detail, but there is a lot of overlap

there is also a great deal of calculus (integrals for inner products of quantum states) and differential equations (Schrodinger's equation)

my advice for these kinds of questions is to figure out which QM textbook you'll be using, then buy it in advance and start looking through it."
