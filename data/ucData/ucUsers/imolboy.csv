socialskills,fpckdls,t1_fpci4xe,1588503817.0,"No worries, meaning tends to get jumbled up like that. It just sucks being college aged and not being able to relate to some people when the only friendships I've had are with misguided people. I find most people that I do want to be friends with are introverted and tend to just focus on themselves rather than looking cool or obsessing over material things. I appreciate you sharing some wisdom."
socialskills,fpchsai,t1_fpchgls,1588501177.0,"When I say they're devoid of a moral compass I mean they drunk drive, talk down to waiters, etc ... I may not be the most amazing person but I know where to draw the line, so in their eyes that makes me a loser. I used to be compatible with these friends as they were childhood friends but I feel like my morals don't line up with them anymore. Thanks for the tips though."

AskReddit,foxxah2,t1_foxwfd3,1588159399.0,"Kinda scary that reality isn’t as concrete as you think it is if you ask me. I’d rather have a stable reality where phenomenon like this don’t exist, that gives it even more meaning imo.

Edit: Also gotta view things through the lens of a mentally ill person"

Advice,fokqfy3,t1_fokoy4j,1587846982.0,At face level that’s what it seems but the majority of people never change their behavior unless they have some sort of epiphany. Also college isn’t all high-tier schools where people are more aware in a sense. So I guess it just depends where you go to school?

computerscience,foa1djh,t3_g6gd9o,1587637268.0,Wanna know how those people seem to grasp it much easier? They've probably been studying outside of class as well. Before I started college I studied a year beforehand and it allowed me to grasp certain concepts very easily because I've somewhat encountered certain situations/concepts before.
TheMidnightGospel,fo6kue2,t3_g5x32d,1587561276.0,"Episode 3 nearly had me in a psychotic state, I had to take my antipsychotic which I don't usually take unless it's severe. Honestly I think I was just reading too much into the exact message they were conveying."

computerscience,fnqnzy8,t3_g3bhyb,1587168472.0,I don't think this question can really be answered. You can find any job in the CS field. The highest paid can be from the CEO to a high-level/senior SWE. If you're in a niche then obviously you're going to be paid more since you're valuable but the chances of getting a job like that are slim.

amiugly,fn4v6ag,t1_fn4stj0,1586649676.0,"Are you a therapist? Yes it’s natural once, seeking to always want to be called attractive is unhealthy, so what if a couple people think you’re ugly? From my pov she’s attractive, from another persons pov she’s ugly, that’s just the way life is. Plus they could be talking about her personality."
amiugly,fn4sai2,t1_fn4megx,1586647875.0,If you bothered to read her post than she seems to always be seeking validation from others for her appearance. It’s not just a one time deal. Always seeking validation from others is unhealthy.

OutOfTheLoop,fmnb51i,t1_fmn7x6t,1586222094.0,Lmfaoo he “choked slammed” is way over the top. The video depicts him barely using any force to take her down like the same way you would a sibling or when you’re joking around. He was probably drunk and I highly doubt he seriously wanted to harm her.
