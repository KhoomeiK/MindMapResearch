Its very much a case study on reactive/viral purchasing habits. I think the areas this will likely impact people the most is in large cities, with reduced impacts on suburbs. And in those locations there very little to hunt anyways. That said, I've noticed some of the grocery stores I go to are still struggling to restock their canned food shelves, either they are bought out immediately or they aren't getting it in at all. I'm starting to consider getting a food dehydrator and starting to store it away in case the situation changes for the worse. 

One final thought,
This pandemic has forced people to be online even more so, onto social media message boards, into their own echo chambers. I suspect, and it seems evident from the protests occurring over the past few months, that politics is only going to be more polarized from here on out."
