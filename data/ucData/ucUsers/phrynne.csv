berkeley,foox5wv,t3_g8an1k,1587948344.0,"This is why I'm getting my Master's in CS at Mills. There are men in the program, Mills is coed at the graduate level, but the kind of men willing to get their degree from a traditionally women's college do not appear to be douchebags. At least none on the men in my classes have been.

I know it's not the same as what you're doing, and I wish you the best of luck. Not all guys there can be douchebags, statistically speaking. But good luck finding the ones who aren't. I hope your classes go well."
