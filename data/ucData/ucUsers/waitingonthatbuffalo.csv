TheWire,fos9iu4,t1_fos95e8,1588026432.0,"What the hell does critical thinking have to do with liking Omar? It’s her opinion. The show goes out of its way to establish that he’s no saint. 

In making this post, I’d hoped to see some discussion of why viewers, myself included, are so drawn to Omar at the start."

TheWire,fornpyg,t1_forn6bw,1588015336.0,"She also “deeply dislikes” not just McNulty but Bunk, the latter I imagine because of his adultery-gone-wrong indiscretion. And she hates Prez for clocking the kid. 

By contrast, D’Angelo, Kima, Wallace and Lester are on her good side."
billsimmons,forkwwl,t1_fork7ja,1588013959.0,"There are worse things to sweat over than whether someone is genuinely concerned or simply enhancing their brand. Hand-wringing over ""fuel"" being added to the culture war does even less to solve our problems."

radiohead,fopgpv8,t1_fop0bob,1587961048.0,"I especially love it because I picture how the SNL audience and entire nation must have reacted to such a grand, crushing performance of a kind of song so many hadn't ever heard before."

radiohead,foion0c,t3_g7ncm2,1587792209.0,"Incredible digging. I've definitely seen this quote for the entire time I've been a fan of the band. Always thought it was a bit more dramatic than Thom ever actually gets about his own music. Thanks for hunting down the truth, or at least something closer to it."
radiohead,fod37ja,t3_g6vth9,1587679280.0,"This is a really funny line, but I don't think Radiohead cared as much as other artists (like Metallica) about song theft. When Amnesiac was leaked, the band's reaction was basically ""at least download the songs in order because we put a lot of thought into the track listing."""

TheStrokes,fn7dzcr,t1_fn7c086,1586718447.0,"You're right that there's always a good bit of retconning by Strokes fans in the U.S., like myself, who want to remember the band's legacy as running deeper than it actually did, because, let's face it, the Strokes are a sexy band that shaped a lot of our musical trajectories. 

But I think you've totally missed OP's point, which is premised entirely on the two bands' music. Not their respective cultural relevance. Music alone (and, granted, in a sub where most of us enjoy all of these bands' albums), OP makes great comparisons about Strokes/AM's general directions. Their sounds haven't evolved in the same ways, but they've branched out at similar checkpoints."

billsimmons,fmwwgns,t1_fmww44j,1586454248.0,"Isn't that a fascinating thing, though? To fall out of love with a sport? I know why people don't like baseball, and I also know why others love it. But for someone to love it and then lose their taste and patience for the game, to look at the same movements and feel differently about them, is novel. Especially when baseball's gameplay hasn't rapidly evolved the way basketball's has."
Journalism,fmm6i0p,t3_fw3tdt,1586199679.0,"Not an amateur question; there's a constant back-and-forth at the highest levels of this industry on the right way to conduct an interview. 

The former executive editor of the New York Times, who last year was accused of plagiarism, once controversially said she hand-writes notes by ear as her interview subjects are speaking (in lieu of audio recording). 

Quite a few journalists criticized this practice — it's really, really hard to type words perfectly as you hear them, much less hand-write. 

My go-to: In phone interviews, I record the audio on speaker (with permission from the subject, and when I have the space to do so, like in my current WFH setting this current moment), and *simultaneously type notes on my computer.* 

That way, when I return to the interview, I already have a visual reminder of what we talked about and when. While I read through my notes, I play back the audio and it's only then that I transcribe select sentences to use in a story. 

I employ this practice largely because I work for a daily newspaper, which creates a huge time constraint in turning stories around quickly and accurately. It took a lot of practice to be able to type while my interview subjects were speaking and still keep enough mental focus on the interview to ask good follow-up questions and navigate the dynamics of a conversation.

When I interview people in person, I record audio scribble into a notepad. These notes come down to a few keywords and perhaps a few timestamps so I can easily access the subject's thoughts after the fact.

For your first go-around, you may find it more helpful to transcribe every word of an interview after the fact. Be warned that it can be a grueling process to do so, but of course it's common practice in transcript interviews (the Q&A format you may notice implemented for important interviews). 

So to answer your question (in the last line of my comment, as is typical of a crummy journalist), there's no obligation to transcribe every word of an interview if you're going to use only a few quotes in a prose-based story. Use your best judgment and make sure everything you write is 1) fully accurate and 2) as contextualized as necessary to be totally accurate."
