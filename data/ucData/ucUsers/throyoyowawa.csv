UCSC,fnijesm,t3_g1z60r,1586981026.0,"‚ÄúBudget gap‚Äù is basically the gap between your charges and your offered aid. Some people pay this outright (and if you live on campus you can even set up a payment plan with your housing accounts advisor to pay ‚Äòrent‚Äô out of pocket monthly to cover the gap). 

Some people take out the parent loans but my parents aren‚Äôt involved in my education so that wasn‚Äôt an option for me. I personally did the payment plan for 2 years (It was like $400 a month to cover my dorm after fin aid) and then the this year I just took out a private loan through Sallie Mae to cover it."
UCSC,fniivo1,t3_g1z9ab,1586980762.0,"I would contact your college advising office ASAP, I know they‚Äôre still doing zoom appointments. Having a W won‚Äôt affect financial aid as long as you have like 35 (I‚Äôd double check the number) units for the entire year. So if you passed all your other classes this year, you‚Äôre perfectly fine to take a W in this one because they calculate it by taking 12 units per quarter I think. So two quarters of 15 units and one quarter of 10 units still meets the minimum requirement to not fuck with financial aid. 

You might be able to swap into a class with an access code but that might be a pain in the ass. I would try to just take a W if the deadline hasn‚Äôt passed yet tbh. But you have to file for it with advising before a certain date!

UCSC,fnhy473,t3_g1lq5x,1586970788.0,"I‚Äôm not in one but I‚Äôve rushed twice and have friends in some, from what I know there are unofficial houses (likely multiple for each sorority though) and it‚Äôs more by virtue of just networking with ppl you know to try and secure housing in the horrible market here. So girls end up passing rooms down to each other but like, that would probably still happen if it was just a large group of friends rather than a sorority, you know what I mean? 

I‚Äôve rushed for a Panhellenic one (the typical kappa kappa alpha or whatever) and then one of the other ones (educational? Idk what it would be called. It was the pre-law co-ed chapter). Personally to me the Panhellenic one was just too much money to justify, all added up it was like thousands to join and thousands in dues and honestly as a freshman it felt more like they were just preying on freshmen who were scared to be lonely lol. It felt like buying friends, which I guess to a certain point might make sense for the other benefits, but it was just too pricy for me personally. They allow payment plans but I wasn‚Äôt about to put myself into ‚Äòdebt‚Äô for some random friends. I really don‚Äôt see how anyone joins unless their parents pay for it. I wouldn‚Äôt say rush is awfully competitive but there are definitely people who don‚Äôt make it. If you‚Äôre bubbly and friendly at events you‚Äôll be fine though. 

I was accepted to the pre-law one (I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone is accepted to the non-Panhellenic ones, and I think was only like $150 to join) but then I got busy and just never actually joined tbh. Rushing for the Panhellenic sorority was like 5 nights of events around campus I think, and rushing for the pre-law one was like an interview and a group dinner I think lol. 

Hope this helped! I didn‚Äôt actually join any of them so other people can probably offer more accurate advice haha."

It‚Äôs a pretty white campus (all the UCs are, by virtue of barriers to entry and all that) but I think the dynamic is probably a little different than Minnesota since everyone is so hyper hyper aware of being more accepting. We‚Äôre split up into 10 residential colleges, idk how your program works but if you can choose a college and want diversity I would aim for Oakes which is generally geared more towards POC. There‚Äôs also the Rosa Parks house in Stevenson and I‚Äôve had a few friends in BSU who lived there and they seem to love it. I‚Äôm white though so I can‚Äôt speak to the experience beyond that!"
UCSC,fnevbug,t1_fncy2a5,1586896513.0,"I lived in the village for 2 years and can vouch for all this. The single rooms are super nice but I recommend choosing a room in the E or F quads if you can, so you‚Äôre closer to the laundry and kitchen. I actually like that it‚Äôs far from things on campus, it came hella in handy during the strikes cuz I could walk to the bay&nobel bus stop in like 15 mins to get to work, and you can walk 15 mins the opposite direction and be in Stevenson or the music center (and a little farther is oakes) if you take the bike path. 

Honestly I recommend it, but it‚Äôs just super easy to become isolated since there‚Äôs no social area for you to get to know your housemates. But having a single room for so cheap kicks ass"

SLO probably has a little bit of a cheaper cost of living (still gonna seem insanely high to you though), but SLO doesn‚Äôt really have the same appeal or ambiance as UCSC. When do you think you‚Äôd come? If you haven‚Äôt researched the COLA strike I‚Äôd look it up, as soon as class is in session again after coronavirus I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre gonna be shutting the school down again.
