fatestaynight,fpgwji1,t1_fpgvc2q,1588610783.0,That guy is still getting bad eBay reviews on his profile 5000 years later.
printSF,fp6kecg,t1_fp5pa9p,1588353848.0,"I don't know if it's because of the quality of the audio book I got, but I had to balance the audio levels in Revelation Space to hear it somewhat properly. That said, it almost added a sense of this being an old recording of these events so I kind of enjoyed it. I think it helped that I read the book years ago so this was a refresher and not the first time I heard it."
gaming,fozcw91,t1_foy8g3b,1588188547.0,"Even then, the early ones had PS2 hardware and a later revision only had software emulation so some games didn't run perfectly. That's the version I have. After that they removed PS2 support entirely. I don't know why they didn't leave the software emulation at least."
starocean,fozcijy,t3_gaanok,1588188366.0,"If you haven't tried it yet, try Tales of Phantasia. The battle system is not exactly the same but it's sort of similar and the graphics are just as pretty. Same developers behind both games but they changed companies between them. In fact, both series are sort of considered sister series."
Disgaea,fowaiy5,t1_fottzhk,1588116059.0,"Killia is strong for sure but Val punched out a god to teach them a lesson, and that's while being crippled by not consuming human blood. I'm sure if he was dropped into the conflict in 5, he'd fit right in as far as power levels go."
UCI,fotmraj,t1_fotj3lc,1588058852.0,"This professor clearly cares, and I'd wager he's far from the only one."
gaming,fok47nj,t1_fojgw8h,1587835101.0,Ah ok thanks for clarifying.
gaming,foi266k,t1_fohflja,1587777190.0,I didn't pay a lot of attention to the lore in the game so I must have missed that bit. Hell just looked like another dimension to me.
gaming,fohck9v,t1_foh3mmr,1587763694.0,"As far as I'm concerned, demons are just aliens."
Disgaea,foaly0q,t1_fo59rcp,1587648901.0,Yeah I don't like monster units at all. I almost never use them. I like my equipped weapons showing.
Disgaea,fo4h8po,t1_fo4dpgx,1587504380.0,"Yeah he wasn't even mentioned. I wish they would have put a bow on his story with at least a ""oh those guys? They went home"" or something."
starocean,fo4gajp,t1_fo49qle,1587503884.0,Max level with the best items in the game (but not perfectly modified) and she still wiped the floor with me on the ps2. I showed her who's boss on the ps4 version last year though.
Stargate,fo4d9n8,t3_g5cv82,1587502357.0,"It's not a Stargate, it's a fargate. Completely different things."
pencils,fo4d0q4,t1_fo47pt8,1587502234.0,Sounds like an artesanal toilet
Disgaea,fo4chaz,t1_fo3zcoj,1587501963.0,"Luckily the rest of the cast was good.

I want Captain Gordon, DEFENDER OF EARTH again."
Cyberpunk,fnzv7md,t1_fnurtdz,1587401326.0,"I just don't feel like typing a lot on my phone. My issue with people getting cyberpunk ""wrong"" has nothing to do with supporting or not supporting Trump. I just wanted to clarify that."
Cyberpunk,fnur8ud,t1_fnuk2u8,1587269014.0,"I'm not calling anyone a fake fan, but I am saying that many on here don't really understand what aesthetic they're even talking about. Like that post the other day of the bright and shining utopia. Nice art, sure. That's not cyberpunk, though. Making something futuristic or even including a robot or two doesn't make something cyberpunk. I can guess what you'll say. I'm not interested in arguing further so I will not be replying to this comment thread anymore."
Cyberpunk,fnufb5j,t1_fnubve8,1587260765.0,I didn't know the audio book was not good. I only read the book.
Cyberpunk,fnuf9b3,t1_fnudj8t,1587260732.0,Expecting basic familiarity with the subject is not gate keeping.
Cyberpunk,fnu83pj,t1_fnu5otw,1587256497.0,More than half the people here haven't even read Neuromancer. They wouldn't know cyberpunk if it mugged them and stole their identities.
gaming,fnieu72,t3_g1ujzc,1586978794.0,"The best Zelda game is the [Zelda game that came out when I was 2], aka ALttP. You can't change my mind."
ProgrammerHumor,fnd1wlx,t1_fnbwchs,1586855476.0,How is the drawing of the black lady basketball throwing her baby not racist?
MadeMeSmile,fnd16p4,t1_fncyi6x,1586854672.0,But not before the roaring twenties.
Saber,fncip11,t1_fnbpg7j,1586837753.0,"But also in a dirty way.

&#x200B;

For that mana, you understand."
Cyberpunk,fnchg3n,t3_g0ol10,1586836842.0,As to be expected of Japan.
programming,fncgx7v,t3_g0um67,1586836475.0,"Wow, what? That's crazy!"
fatestaynight,fncfvx9,t3_g0urdt,1586835759.0,I like her triangle pupils.
Disgaea,fnc47yg,t1_fnb4qey,1586828270.0,I heard good things about a few of them but I only really played the Disgaea games on the PS3 so I can't really recommend any others. I'm sure some might be good. I played Trinity Universe for a bit and it was kinda fun. Etna shows up in it. It felt like a proto-Neptunia game. I haven't really tried most other games by NIS on that system.
Disgaea,fnb234b,t1_fn9vtkb,1586807864.0,"Oh, sorry to hear that.

Tactics Ogre has a lot of side missions from what I remember. I haven't beat the game (had issues with the save file getting corrupted and haven't started it again yet) so I don't know what the post game looks like. It plays very similarly to FFT, though, which is why if you like one you might like the other. FFT also has a few side missions but no real post game either, BTW."
Disgaea,fn7x3fs,t1_fn6dh14,1586729381.0,"Yeah I wonder why D3 and DD2 got skipped. They're both great entries in their own rights.

If FFT ends up being up OPs alley, Tactics Ogre is also worth a shot. Both are on PSP."
PSP,fmrh963,t1_fmr9o1n,1586323143.0,"Its technically illegal, but take normal precautions such as using a VPN and not using dodgy websites and you'll be fine. Most companies don't care that much about their old IPs, though some like Nintendo absolutely do."
fatestaynight,fmmszto,t1_fmmh2gi,1586211497.0,African or European?
MadeMeSmile,fmivla2,t1_fmhq1ac,1586117809.0,Still a better love story than the entire bible
