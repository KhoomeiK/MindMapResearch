apexlegends,fpfslax,t1_fpf6v36,1588581993.0,"Passive seems like bad game design IMO. 

Part of the reason Bloodhound’s new scan works the way it does is to verify that they’re not about to run into an ambush. If this was implemented, suddenly Bloodhound’s tactical is only useful when it actually detects something; that would severely nerf it and Bloodhound doesn’t need a nerf.

A better passive would be to cover the sounds of his team’s tacticals within a small radius. Caustic placing traps, Wattson fencing, Lifeline popping drone, etc. are all dead giveaways that the team has to prep for a certain legend. By covering those sounds, players can’t get the drop on the team but they can still see the tacticals. It also allows for an indirect buff to Lifeline, as her tactical is usually a signal to run in and third party."

titanfall,fp5elqq,t1_fp4972w,1588326488.0,"Tbh my biggest problem with Tone isn’t Titan vs Titan. She counters Ion, Legion, and Monarch while losing hard to Ronin and struggles against Northstar. Scorch can go either way, depending on the map. Just be familiar with the matchup and you’ll probably be fine.

Tone vs. Pilot is incredibly unfun to play. Every other titan has exploitable weaknesses:

Ion has to spend a good chunk of energy for laser shot, which isn’t always worth it

Ronin’s bullets fizzle out at mid range, meaning poking him from a distance is free

Northstar has no real defensive option, so she’s constantly using cover. Pretty easy to surprise her by jumping out of the building before she can see you. Her railgun shot also can’t be spammed, so you have some time between shots if she’s missing.

Legion takes time to spin up his gun, so you can peek to get damage

Monarch needs 3 shots to kill you, so varying where you peek from can rack up a lot of damage.

Tone’s tracking missiles (from her 40m) are fast, huge, 1HKO, and spammable. It’s incredibly easy to rack up tons of pilot kills, especially the pilots that like to move around the map instead of hiding the whole time. There’s not really a safe zone against Tone; it’s like if an EPG was combined with a slightly worse Wingman Elite. 

Combine that with her pulse and her particle wall and trying to actually get potshots on her is all but impossible. It’s reliant on the Tone player being bad as opposed to exploiting the Titan’s weaknesses."
titanfall,fp5bzpz,t1_fp588zn,1588323681.0,"Energy siphon is the only defensive ability on an aggressive or flank titan that can’t be used to push or anchor, though. Northstar has the excuse of “if you’re not using cover, you’re being a shitty sniper” but Monarch’s kit revolves around her being aggressive one way or another. I’d actually say that using Energy Siphon defensively is the wrong way to use it; it gives a small amount of shield and stuns the enemy, so it should be used while pushing to get your damage off and retreat if necessary. Getting pot shots for more shield is good too."

The disinfectant in question is known as [Thiomersal (or thimerosal)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html). However, the amount of thiomersal in vaccines is very small; a .5mL dose contains only [50 μg Thiomersal](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines). This is equivalent to 0.00005 grams. Compare this to the lethal dose: [5 mg/70 kg is defined as mercury poisoning, and 150 to 300 mg/70 kg is a lethal dose; it is a very high concentration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3514465/). For reference, 70 kg is 154 lb and 5mg=0.005g. This means that you would need 100 vaccines to suffer from mercury poisoning and 3,000 vaccines to die from it. The amount of disinfectant in the average vaccine is *tiny.* In other words, **injecting a vaccine is nowhere close to injecting a disinfectant, as Trump specifically said.**

If you were to inject .5mL of Thiomersal [(with a solubility of 1g/1mL)](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB11590) into your body, you would be putting 0.5g of Thiomersal into your body. This would be enough to **kill you 3 times over**.

But sure, tell me more about how I'm a sheep for knowing that disinfectant will kill you if it's injected. If you disagree, I'd love to see the evidence and math that supports your conclusion. If you don't have evidence to support your point, please don't embarrass yourself further by responding."

#1: Spitfire campers. 1/5

Just annoying. Even on PC, they shut down your ability to move fast. Removes the skill floor of ""if you want to do well, you have to know how to move."" Turns Titanfall 2 into COD with mechs. Even if you kill them, they're not gonna stop. 

#2: Smart Pistol. 2/5

A bit unpopular, but I don't have too much of a problem with the Smart Pistol. I don't think it should be in the game, but a lot of SP users I come up against don't know how to move properly, so I can break line of sight and bait them into pushing me unsafely. Good players with SP are annoying. 

#3: Entire team of one titan in Titan Brawl. 5/5

Not too bad, tbh. You'll usually be able to convince 1-2 of your teammates to switch to that titan's counter. If it's a bunch of Tones, then 2-3 Ronins will demolish them. If it's a bunch of Legions, go Ion/Scorch. Bunch of Ions? Go Tone. It can be annoying if your entire team refuses to cooperate, but if they refuse to cooperate you're probably going to lose anyways.

#4: Teammates leaving the game. 4/5

Usually not too bad, tbh. If people aren't having fun, then I don't blame them for leaving. I find that the people who leave are generally near the bottom of the leaderboard anyways. Most of the time, they're benefiting the enemy by giving them Titan Meter/Core more than they're benefiting the team, so I don't have a problem with them leaving. Can be annoying in Amped Hardpoint/Bounty Hunt, since you don't need to be good in order to contribute in a significant way. 

#5: Call of Duty people coming and teabagging every time they kill someone. 3/5

To rip off of General Marder, ""[someone else's immaturity] is not my concern."" It's annoying when a high-level player does it, since they're just being toxic. Still, I know they're just looking for a reaction, so I ignore it.

titanfall,foi496d,t3_g7kxp7,1587778394.0,"Most of the boss fights come down to ""be more careful than you think you need to."" Tone is especially useful for a good chunk of bosses since Particle Wall allows you to safely reposition and get free damage. 

The most annoying tick fight, [Control Room, can be skipped entirely.](https://youtu.be/q2nQ4RrxhzA?t=35) In general, though, it's all about baiting them. Try to be near a wall that you can wallbounce (wallrun and quickly jump off) off of; once ticks start their explosion animation, they can't move anymore. If you can get them to explode while you're flying away, then you'll be able to handle them pretty well.

Most of the differences boil down to ""the enemy deals more damage."" Play safer than you think you need to when you engage in fights and remember that very few fights are mandatory. Run away using Titanfall movement as much as possible. Even though the enemies deal a lot of damage per hit, they still suck at hitting a fast-moving target."

ShermanPosting,fod3yyn,t1_foa91tr,1587679555.0,"I’m betting they’re saying “blue states need to secede so that red states stop taking money from them. The country being dependent on red states while red states take more money than they give is a sign the country is going to die.”

Liberalism likely refers to neoliberalism, which is centrist to center-right. The Democratic party is neoliberal and the Republican Party is mostly neoliberal."

apexlegends,foa3cav,t1_fo9svyc,1587638534.0,"A gel that contains the compound could work. Caustic slathering it on the exposed parts of his body before the games would definitely prevent him from taking damage.

Also, the environment also is unfazed by explosives, thermite, and energy blasts. It’s likely made of an ultrastrong material that has been painted/aesthetically changed to look like metal or whatever elseZ"
apexlegends,foa3543,t1_fo9sfgi,1587638409.0,"Not necessarily. The shields might be energy-based (kind of like a force field) which doesn’t need a specific material to work. This explains how they don’t take damage from the Ring, from Caustic’s gas, and from Revenant’s ability; they simply aren’t configured to repel incoming damage from those sources/conditions. It would also explain how Evo shields can instantly gain shield capacity; they’re toned down by the Games’ host and boosted up as damage is dealt."

PoliticalCompassMemes,fo66e7i,t1_fo661kb,1587548228.0,"Mostly speculation, but I think it’s due to the same reason leftist unity is so hard.

Take an extremely cultural right-wing position, like Nazism. Chances are, you’ll be able to find a sizeable group of neo-Nazis who believe the ideal society is that particular far-right society that has been done in the past.

Take an extremely left-wing position. What are the chances that you can amass a group with any sort of presence? You have to find like-minded people who think drastically reforming society in a very particular way is the ideal society. You might find a couple of like-minded folk, but it’s very doubtful that you’ll be able to convince leftists to subscribe to your particular extreme ideology. 

There’s definitely radical/extreme leftist people out there, but they all tend to disagree with each other. Right-wing thought generally doesn’t have this problem."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fo65sd9,t1_fo5rj35,1587547567.0,obviously it’s because advocating genocide is a rational argument and the only way to stop people from ~~falling for misleading and false propaganda~~ waking up and not being sheeple is to ban those subs

Crazy how r/WatchPeopleDie got banned only a few days after a news article was released about it, despite uploading consistently similar content for at least a year

random coincidence, I’m sure.

I don’t have an issue with Reddit’s TOS, but they only enforce it when they’re pressured to do so."
