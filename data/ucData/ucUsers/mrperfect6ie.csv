Triumph,fpidpay,t3_gdmbt9,1588638783.0,I went back and forth between thinking this was accidental and intentional
UCDavis,fpgu9x5,t1_fpft930,1588609627.0,See paragraph 3
UCDavis,fpekyj6,t1_fpejf69,1588549559.0,From my understanding it is as of this current year. Incoming transfers are the first to apply to it as an impacted major.
UCDavis,fpekut2,t3_gd09b8,1588549501.0,"I did exactly this. My community college had a terrible economics program, so instead I worked to transfer as a mathematics major. When I was accepted as a Math major I worked to change it to Econ. Same college so the process was extremely easy. Heck you got accepted as a math major, you're obviously capable.

Only hiccup is that you'll have to complete one quarter at UCD before you can change major. Naturally, you'll have to do that in your accepted major. There are definitely mistakes and opportunities here. I made the mistake of signing up for math classes and really struggling with that my first quarter. It made for a terrible introduction to upper level university (on top of getting used to this place, quarter system, the lot).

If I could do it again I would definitely advise myself to sign up for easier ""required to graduate"" classes for my first quarter, like upper division writing and any prerequisite classes you may need for a major of your interest. During that first quarter focus on general success while introducing yourself to the dean's office and major counselors. This way you'll be able to change without issue.

It's easy to do, be wise about it and kind to yourself. Best wishes."

My 2008 Kawa felt massive compared to this 675r. It's only a 30lb change but somehow the 675r just feels so much lighter. For the first time I feel like I can completely trust a bike through a corner and dip lower if I need to. I haven't even touched on the engine/trans yet, and I'll cover it by saying there was no chance I could power wheelie through first and into second gear on the Kawa. The Daytona is just so much more a complete package. This is a hero I can say I'm glad I met"

UCDavis,fohytf6,t1_fohxzpm,1587775303.0,"I'm not trying to be sassy with you, just realistic. Large companies like this have massive levels of overhead that need consistent income to cover.

On top of this it could be an accounting trick to write onto their taxes in order to be able to claim more money. (Example of one reason this happens most of us have seen: The Office, S5E10).  


All I was trying to say is that as you get more involved in high level markets, insane amounts of capital seem to become more common. It's incredibly shocking at first, yes, but it's easy to come across"

They're just very strict. If you absolutely don't have the money to pay you can defer your rent (due to a State order) for up to 3 months, but once that's over you'll owe for the full amount. It's unfortunate but we signed leases, we're responsible"

Most glasses fit under any helmet, I wear them myself when I ride/race. It's good practice to wear some discount $20 glasses (online like goggles4u or eyebuydirect) under your helmet so you don't break your good ones. Visors are UV filtering and all that anyway.

Do NOT go cheap on your helmet. Look for ECE or Snell ratings, don't just get a DOT $100 helmet. My Bell Star helmet (Snell rated) saved my life when a car pulled out of a driveway without seeing me and I went head on into his windshield. ICU for 2 weeks is better than death. You can find good closeout deals on RevZilla, I got my $600 helmet for like $350 or something at the time. Get one that fits right. Bell for oval heads, AGV for round, shoei is good as well. Get a name brand. Also they're way more comfortable."
