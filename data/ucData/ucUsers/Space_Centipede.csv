Trump did not fire the pandemic response team. That is just another democratic fake news to win in November, just like when they said Trump called the virus a hoax. The move was a reorganization within the same organization. The people are still there, just different titles. 

Trump also inherited an unmaintained stockpile from Obama. He just was lucky this pandemic didn’t break out during his time. 

Additionally, we didn’t even refuse testing kits from other countries. 

“Former Vice President Joe Biden falsely claimed that the WHO “offered the testing kits that they have available” but “we refused them.” The U.S. did not actively turn down testing kits from the WHO, although it could have requested them. The kits, however, are primarily intended for lower income nations without testing capacity.”

The same officers could've been out doing something more useful. 

Similarly, why can't people who have other types of businesses (other than grocery stores) be open? This is a much lower risk than a grocery store.

I believe it is a misconception that the US did not begin testing as early as other countries. During the initial stages, there was a test kit shortage in virtually every country. No one was really doing any extensive testing in February other than China. However, as you even mentioned in your post, you have to consider that Germany, Iceland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc. have much less population and subsequently needed **much fewer** test kits than the US to achieve a similar per capita testing rate early on. Because of that, number of tests conducted per capita is not a reliable indication of how a country did in terms of an early response. However, as more kits become available and testing becomes more common, it could eventually become a reliable indicator."

You can't deny that there exists a us vs. them mentality amongst internationals and non-internationals at this school. The primary reason for that, in my opinion, is the fact that most international students do not socialize with non-internationals. If a certain group within a community refuses to engage with the rest of the people, it is destined to create a barrier. I've personally tried to socialize with internationals, but most who are from China either don't socialize back or just say 1-2 words and end the convo. 

Another big reason is WeChat and several big Chinese groups there that engage in academic dishonesty. Not saying that every student participates in this, but you also can't deny the existence of it. My Asian friends have told me several times about the existence of question banks and rent-a-tutor services where they will do your homework for you or will help you during your test.
