Space in libraries would be almost cut in half maybe even a 1/3rd, classes could easily go online, people would still party and do social events which would ruin the point of this, RSF and Memorial would be a complete mess (there would be lines upon lines to go inside, with the 6 feet rule it would only get worse).

If campus is going to do a mix of online and in person, for the sake of ppl’s sanity just make it online completely at that point."
