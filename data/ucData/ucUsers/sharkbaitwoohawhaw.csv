SkincareAddicts,foq91y8,t1_foq8s42,1587987182.0,"yes. ceramides improve the skin’s barrier and helps your skin retain moisture. also, it may help if you apply niacinamide before the ceramide cream."

SkincareAddicts,fnojwt4,t3_g2w3fq,1587127130.0,Try ceramide cream. It improves your skin barrier and is super moisturizing. I had the same problem with my nose and around my mouth. I started using Cosrx ceramide cream & it made the irritation & dry flakes disappear the next day.

After the preschool closed, I applied to many grocery stores, Costco, and pharmacies. No one called me back except for a pharmacy.
