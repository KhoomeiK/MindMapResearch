washu,fpldxh1,t3_ge55h7,1588710985.0,"I think next semester the Math department is offering Math 131E, which is a class that teaches Calculus I but caters to students whose backgrounds might not be super extensive. It’s taught by Professor Johnson and they integrate the review of precalculus concepts into the course to help you build a solid foundation while also teaching the material. I think it is an option if you think you’d appreciate some review, and you’ll be ready to take Math 132 the semester after."
washu,fpfpvgx,t3_gd5kut,1588579208.0,"I think being nervous is very normal; before coming here I also heard a lot about WashU's brutal academics. After being here for two semesters, I think that image is very overblown, and it's one that gets propagated frequently in many channels such as r/ApplyingToCollege and College Confidential (which are both places where you've probably heard about this).

I feel like it has been doable getting good grades in the classes I have taken so far (A- and higher) so long as you keep up with the work. I'm on track to a >3.9 GPA after finishing two semesters here, having taken OChem 1, DiffEq, CSE 131 and ESE 105 first semester and UCollege Biochem, Biology 1 and Physics 2 this semester. Where I've noticed people tend to mess up is by leaving all of their studying for the week before midterms or overloading themselves with other commitments they can't balance properly. In short: Don't procrastinate too much (a little is fine because everyone does that).

Before you think I was one of those kids who absolutely destroyed high school and graduated valedictorian and what not with like a 4.8 GPA, 1570+ SAT and 10+ AP courses and straight 5s on the tests while doing a million extracurriculars at once: I wasn't, not even close; there were a lot of smarter people at my high school (and here!) whose accomplishments and grades are a reminder that I am not (and never was) anyone notable. I got Bs in classes my classmates considered easy, less than ideal scores on some AP tests, retook the SAT multiple times because I just couldn't figure out my life and study enough to do well in one shot. I was never a perfect student who could handle everything. Most people here who get high GPAs didn't consider themselves that type of student in high school either. My point when I say this is it's very possible to do well here as a non-genius or someone who doesn't have a perfect work ethic. Someone who has made mistakes academically in the past isn't doomed to failure here, even if it is difficult.

If you're worried, WashU provides a lot of academic support systems for students like PLTL in Physics, Calc 1 &2 and General Chem, BTL in Biology 1 and 2, workshops in OChem, free tutoring if you're an Engineering student, etc etc etc. there's lots of ways that you can find success in classes here. I think it also helps that upper-division courses in the Biology department tend to have high averages as well, something like B+ or higher seems to be commonplace.

TL;DR. If you come to WashU for pre-med, you'll be okay. Keep a good pace, don't overload, and you'll be on track to success."

ApplyingToCollege,fp84z6u,t1_fp7zb4i,1588383644.0,"I have no idea who downvoted you, but as a WashU student I agree with this statement. Most people do take OChem at a state school, but it's still quite manageable even at WashU. I took OChem 1 last semester, and unlike popular belief surrounding WashU OChem you do not need to constantly be studying just to get a B or higher; just space out the material properly instead of cramming

As a whole, the pre-med courses are not overly difficult, but will still force any student taking them to study if they want a good grade. Adding on to this, classes are not EXPLICITLY curved, rather the professors set grade cutoffs (i.e. both General Chemistry sequences A- or higher = 75, B- or higher = 55, etc etc, in Physics it's a straight scale where A = 93, A- = 90, B+ = 87, etc) and will just calibrate the test difficulty to get a distribution they want. They will also drop, but NEVER RAISE, cutoffs if necessary. This means that students have little incentive to sabotage each other as their grade will be based entirely on their OWN ability.

Also agree about the being cheaper part. IMO the extra $20,000/year for Vanderbilt isn't worth it."
ApplyingToCollege,fp84jik,t3_gbsoxd,1588383296.0,"WashU student here, the ""grade deflation"" that I hear constantly being echoed on this sub when talking about WashU pre-med courses is WAY over-exaggerated. Most pre-med students who don't get the grades they want are not screwed over because of competition or other people, but by their own (lack of) study habits and/or insufficient mastery of the course material.

I'd even go out on a limb to say there's grade inflation; the class averages for General Chemistry, Biology, OChem and Physics all sit within the B/B+ range which I feel is extremely generous, and at worst on par with peer institutions. This grade inflation only becomes more apparent in upper division courses; the average grade students earn in many upper division Biology courses such as Physiological Control Systems, Biochemistry through UCollege and Human Physiology are A-'s or A's! From my own personal experience, I have never had to study from sunup to sundown every day to get a high GPA both semesters that I've been here, even while taking 3+ STEM courses.

With the exception of OChem, professors do not explicitly curve, rather they prefer to use fixed grade cutoffs and calibrate their tests to get the distribution they want (and also drop, but NEVER raise grade cutoffs to do so if necessary). In most cases, this means that your grade is based solely on your own ability, and not the ability of your classmates, so no one here has an incentive to work against other students.

With regards to opportunities, WashU has plenty. Many of my friends attending other universities have had to shotgun emails to professors to get research positions; this is not the case at WashU. Many of my friends who got a position sent out maybe 2 or 3 emails at most (I personally only had to send out one, and I got a response in 2 hours). This applies to both on-campus opportunities and those at WashU School of Medicine, which is only a 5 minute MetroLink ride from the main campus.

Finally, what I think really seals the deal in your case is that it's cheaper than Vanderbilt. Not only are you saving money by attending WashU, but you're still getting probably one of the best pre-med academic experiences available at any school in the country."

I'd say if you have AP Calculus credit of any kind and don't feel completely lost with the material then Math 131 isn't something you need to go out of your way to retake.

By that I mean a 4 or 5 on either AP Calculus test renders Math 131 unnecessary for your needs, and I'd strongly encourage you to take 132 (or in the case of Calculus BC, 233)."

washu,fotv5vm,t3_g9jp9c,1588067259.0,"A couple friends of mine took Math 132 last semester and all of them considered the class to be more than manageable / easy to handle. One of my friends even called the class a joke; he had a 99 in the class but earned Bs in Pre Calculus and AP Calculus AB in high school and thought 132 was far easier than what he had to put up with by a long shot. There’s also a lot of support resources like PLTL (Peer Led Team Learning) that can help you master the material. 

Math 233 was also manageable last semester based on my friends’ experiences although the test averages were a bit lower and they did have to work to do well. I didn’t take 233 at WashU but I felt that the topics covered in the class (Calculus 3) were far more intuitive than the Calculus 2 which I encountered in AP Calculus BC.

Math 217 has always been a bit weird, last semester Humberto Diaz and Gregory Knese taught the course and the class was a complete pushover with test averages in the solid A range because the tests (shared by both Diaz’s section and Professor Knese’s section) were basically carbon copies of the practice midterms. To be honest I don’t even think you needed differential equations knowledge to do well on the tests, a lot of people just read the posted practice midterm solutions and memorized how to do the problems — my friend aced the third midterm and he had no idea how to do any problems related to one of the test topics until like 30 minutes before. Consequently I think the course could be more rigorous to differentiate between those who have a solid understanding of the topics and those who don’t. The homeworks were really weird and sometimes had no relation to what we were learning in class; they were definitely harder than the midterms themselves and I did not find them helpful at all because of the disconnect between what topics were being discussed and what the homeworks actually covered. 

With Krantz this semester I think it’s largely the same deal, time consuming and difficult homeworks but easy tests with high averages. I believe Diaz is teaching again this fall so I expect the gist of the class to be the same unless the Math department cracks down on the class (which I doubt they will). I am aware however that Diaz seems to omit some topics from his version of the course compared to Krantz; I never learned about Fourier series and transforms, but my friend who has Krantz this semester has covered it.

Another disclaimer is that classes seem to be heavily professor dependent in the Math department and consequently your experiences could vary wildly depending on who is teaching (see Krantz vs Diaz & Knese for Math 217)"

ApplyingToCollege,fot585x,t1_fot17yo,1588044922.0,"> does washu feel very premed focused? 

I would say it depends on what you're studying, but since you're majoring in Biology or Neuro you're definitely going to meet a LOT of pre-meds, especially your first year here. If we go by student enrollment in General Chemistry (both the Chem 105/106 and Chem 111/112 sequences) there's around 700-750 kids who sign up first semester and around 650-700 who sign up for second semester. In Biology 2960 (the first Biology class) there's 600ish students enrolled. If we take out the students who have to take it as Engineering majors or aren't pre-med then we're looking at around 500-600 kids entering as premeds, so around 1/3 of the entering freshman class.

Out of that ballpark range of students, 350-400 students will apply to medical school depending on the year ( [https://www.aamc.org/system/files/2019-11/2019\_FACTS\_Table\_A-2.4.pdf](https://www.aamc.org/system/files/2019-11/2019_FACTS_Table_A-2.4.pdf) ), so it thins out a bit as time goes on. Overall, pre-meds will still be a common sight and you'll run into them often in classes like Cell Biology, Human Physiology, Biochemistry or Physiological Control Systems as many people take those courses as extra preparation for the MCAT and to fulfill their major requirements. 

With all this comes the whole pre-med culture which I personally don't find very pleasant as there's an extremely big focus on grades and I get the sense that many of the students are just taking courses to get them over with, but this isn't exclusive to WashU and my brother frequently commented on the ultracompetitiveness of MCB / Neurobio majors when he was a student at Cal (however he wasn't pre-med). Lots of students will try to get into the electives they consider easy A's or all try to sign up for the professor who grades the easiest if there are multiple options for the same class. I will say that despite all this, students don't try to actively sabotage each other and most will still collaborate with you on assignments or to study. Just don't let stress / grades culture get to you, although depending on which Bay Area HS you went to, you're likely no stranger to that.

I think the Biology majors themselves are also very tailored to medicine and biomedical research as opposed to being more ""general"", and this is reflected in the number of pre-health oriented electives such as MedPrep, PEMRAP, etc. offered through the Biology department. This is understandable considering the institution and medical school's focus on being a biomedical powerhouse (we are particularly strong in genomics). If all this sounds great then you'll likely enjoy your time here.

> is there a most common major at washu? 

I think Computer Science is the most popular for obvious reasons and also because it's very manageable to pick up CS as a double major or minor here, so most people pick up one of those along the way (I've also met a lot of CS pre-meds because it's one of the most manageable engineering majors). As expected, Biology is also common and finally majors within Olin (the business school) are also very popular.

> l am still not entirely decided on a major or career path and i would like the flexibility to explore. 

It's very very VERY easy to sign up for classes in any department here and the only real limitation is whether the class you want to take has space. It's also very easy to switch majors here. You could hypothetically switch from any ArtSci major to any engineering major, even something like BME or CS and all it would take is a couple of forms and maybe a meeting with your advisor. I know some students who realized they didn't want to go to medical school for a variety of reasons and switched into CS or a business school major. It's the one process most people don't read too much into because the only thing stopping them is their own decision to switch or not. The one exception I've heard is majors within Olin, but even then I don't think it's difficult to switch after taking some of the classes.

I hope this helped!"
ApplyingToCollege,fot0euj,t1_fosx86q,1588041890.0,"That sucks ass and I'm sorry you had to put up with that. I will say though that many WashU students don't tend to leave the bubble around the school because honestly it has most of the things you'd be looking for, but as someone who's Asian just be prepared to put up with things like racist remarks when you leave the immediate vicinity of the school and always go out with a group of friends when you do. Otherwise, I think I am enjoying my time here.

On campus I have not seen anyone being outwardly hostile towards Asians and we have many Asian American groups on campus who have a visible presence and would obviously not stand for shit like what I had to deal with if it were to occur on campus.

I've never lived in Berkeley long enough to say whether I think racism is a huge issue there, but I suspect that having a large percentage of students who go to school and live there also identifying as Asian helps a lot.

Contentious topics aside: If you have any other concerns regarding the school ask away!"
ApplyingToCollege,fosvus8,t1_fosrfyw,1588039114.0,"I agree that WashU's undergraduate experience is very good like you mentioned in another comment (otherwise I wouldn't even have applied). The school definitely tries to support undergraduates starting from their transition to college with academic support systems like Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL), Residential Peer Mentors (RPM) and the like. We also tend to have smaller, tight-knit communities particularly in smaller majors; I'm in Electrical Engineering (which is very small at WashU) and it's very easy to get in touch with professors and even the two department heads. Class sizes are also small as you move into upper division electives (depending on which you choose). As for finding opportunities I think it's very easy, I sent out exactly one email to a PI regarding research opportunities and I got a response within 2 hours which has more or less turned into a research position. You have the medical school 5 minutes away on the MetroLink (think of it as the STL analogy of BART) and the campus itself, and if you're interested in biology or biomedical research WashU is unsurprisingly a good place to be. Overall, the academic experience is great and I have felt challenged and intellectually stimulated while also not getting the feeling that I am being overwhelmed. If you do choose to come here it is true that you will be at one of the best schools for pre-med in the country. But this sentence gives me some concern:

>for some reason i just didn't vibe with washu and stl when i visited.

This is an important one. You're going to be in STL for 4 years. You likely already know STL is very different from Berkeley or whichever Bay Area city you come from. It is also a bit of a sleepier city and one some would also argue to be ""dying"". We do have a small tech / biotech scene in the city and we also have an organization on campus (Sling Health) that is essentially a biotech club that connects students with industry and physicians to work on technology projects, but it's nothing compared to having the whole Bay Area basically at your disposal. Berkeley is connected very well to the rest of the Bay Area if you think the city feels small, and if you're feeling homesick once in a while BART has you covered and you can just go home on the weekends (trust me, this will happen) instead of having to wait for major academic breaks and the like and then spending hundreds of dollars to fly home and back (which could be another financial concern). I will say that WashU has a lot of things going on just within campus and that a lot of students feel at home (including me to an extent).

<This may not apply to you, and disclaimer for anyone reading **that this is just my experience**\> If you're Asian you've likely also noticed that the Asian population is not as large here outside the immediate grounds and vicinity of WashU, which doesn't sound like a big deal until you consider the recent Covid-19 pandemic and what has been going on with regards to that. Before the pandemic exploded and everyone was ordered to go home my friends and I did have to deal with not infrequent confrontations or callouts regarding ""bringing the virus"" when I ran errands getting groceries and the like. It has not made me feel comfortable leaving the general vicinity of WashU and going beyond areas like the Delmar Loop, although in the future after this pandemic concludes (if ever) I will still make efforts to explore the city and of course make essential trips.

While I know the Bay Area has an issue with this as well at least there's a large Asian population attempting to push back against such bigotry. In STL that population is decidedly smaller and doesn't have as much power as it does here. Some of my friends and relatives have commented on STL being a ""racist shithole city"", and while I don't agree FULLY I completely understand where they are coming from, especially considering what I've had to put up with. I will admit I have had thoughts of just GTFOing after graduating and have also considered not even applying to WashU or SLU for medical school or graduate school when that day comes.

Again, this is just what I have experienced and it's entirely likely my racist encounters could have just been an anomaly. It's entirely likely other students who are Asian-American at WashU have not had to deal with things like this. But it's something to think about because heightened racism towards Asian-Americans won't end with this pandemic. If you have any more questions ask away"
ApplyingToCollege,fosqv3q,t3_g84zsp,1588036171.0,"As a WashU student & Bay Area native who is taking pre-med classes (but am not one myself...yet), I think the choice is pretty clear here.

Go to UC Berkeley.

I'm also a California native and honestly the so-called grade deflation at Cal is not a thing; all of my friends have gotten good grades (>3.8 GPA) at Cal just by staying on top of things, and none of them consider themselves to be geniuses. My brother studied at Cal as well and also did well just by staying on top of his work. As a WashU student I've noticed that pre-med prereqs tend to have a fair amount of grade inflation (B/B+ average in the primary prereqs, even higher in upper division courses), but I seriously don't think that alone is worth the possibility of going into debt.

Maintain a work ethic and you'll be okay. It's not like going to Berkeley prohibits you from getting a GPA above 3.7. Also, you went to HS in the Bay Area and likely did well academics-wise if you could get into these schools. That alone makes me confident that you will succeed ANYWHERE you end up.

You still have to pay for medical school, and both of these schools are elite institutions that will serve you well for any career path you are considering. Just pick the cheaper option unless something extremely specific about WashU motivates you to attend."

I'm a WashU student majoring in Electrical Engineering and have friends at Purdue majoring in CS; the workload can and will get crazy at both schools, but we have all been doing great for ourselves up to now. I'd say WashU being a T20 private school has more grade inflation across the board (most of the class averages in Engineering hover around a B+ or A-), which helps a lot, but as a whole you'll earn great grades at both schools for being on top of things.

I haven't talked to my friends much about community at Purdue, but engineering at WashU tends to be small and very tightly knit. For smaller majors like Electrical and Systems Engineering I have been able to reach out directly to the department heads and participate in forums with them and other students where we give feedback on courses and bring up any issues we have encountered. 

Most engineering students are friendly and will go out of their way to help other students (aside from a few outliers, but you'll find people you don't get along with at any school), and since the cohort for most majors are small you'll run into the same people frequently over time and possibly also build friendships with them."

The content in General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry does not overlap that much, and the topics that do are reviewed anyways. For someone who did not take General Chemistry, the class still gave me a good idea of what was going on with regards to those topics.

I'd argue that it's not definitively more difficult, it's just *different.* For some people, the focus on conceptual thinking, reaction mechanisms and the like as opposed to math fits them perfectly, and they enjoy it. Some people love the class so much (or more likely, they're just pre-meds -- but those two aren't mutually exclusive) they'll take OChem II as well. Some people find it a bit more awkward and don't enjoy it as much or find it difficult. Some people also leave the class with a seething hate for a specific equilateral six-sided shape (I heard it's called a hexagon). I have friends in all camps. As for me, I was a far bigger fan of the class than I was of AP Chem.

Either way, the class wasn't horribly time consuming; I personally put in around 4-6 hours a week on average (most of them on the week before the tests, however) and still did well. There's four midterms and a final, but they'll drop your lowest score just like in General Chemistry. Looking at the syllabus for General Chem lab, OChem lab is also far less stressful; there's no separate midterms or finals or anything that you need to spend time on, and the labs are very standard write-ups.

UC Berkeley does not require their L&S CS majors to take physics either (only EECS majors have to take the Physics 7 series for engineers), and they have not been disadvantaged much if at all from not having that knowledge base."

washu,fngubz5,t3_g1kbhx,1586945255.0,"I can say that it is possible, because I did this myself last semester to place out of Calc 3 and I had even less footing to go off of (self-studied the material over the summer without any kind of class). 

If you took these classes through your HS:

It’s a very informal oral exam where you work out problems that Professor Blake Thornton gives you on the whiteboard while explaining your thought process and showing your work. The length varies based on how proficient you are; if you’re really clueless or you know your stuff down pat it’s super easy to tell and you’ll be out and done in 20-30 minutes (I was out within 25, for reference). If you’re somewhere in the middle it’ll take longer before Thornton can give an accurate diagnosis of your ability and recommend a course of action. 

However I would highly recommend taking Math 203 (or whichever class Honors Mathematics I is). With your background it shouldn’t be too difficult and it would be quite interesting. It’s also a much more rigorous course that dives deeper into topics such as proof-writing, which is a good skill to have moving into upper division math courses that you wouldn’t be exposed to as much in standalone Calc 3 classes which are frequently very computation heavy. If you enjoy it, the second semester (Math 204) is also there as an option which dives into Linear Algebra topics.

If you took these classes through a community college or 4-year university: 

Gather the syllabus for your Calc 3 class and send it to WashU to transfer the credit. Provided your class covers up to Green’s Theorem, curl and divergence, it will likely give you credit for the class at WashU. If you choose, you could do the same with your linear algebra class."

Depending on which school you're in (Arts & Sciences, Engineering, Olin, Sam Fox, etc) you'll get a 4-year advisor as well as a faculty / major advisor who both will help you stay on track academically. Before first semester starts, you'll fill out a registration worksheet outlining what courses you want to take and you will have to run it by your 4-year advisor before they can approve you to register. 

If you have questions or would be comfortable having some guidance with regards to planning out your semester, he / she will likely be knowledgeable enough (and if not, they will ask your faculty advisor) to help you create a schedule moving forward.

The registration approval itself is usually always guaranteed to you, unless you do something extreme w/ regards to your schedule like take a full schedule of classes completely unrelated to your intended major or take a full load of upper division courses without having any prerequisites. For less extreme cases, they'll likely caution you or just throw out a reminder, but if it isn't anything that they feel will give you an extreme amount of trouble you should be good to go."

ApplyingToCollege,fnc33tt,t3_g0s6tl,1586827601.0,"As a WashU student I can say that we are definitely a smaller community and that opportunities are definitely not difficult to find. As for social life, most of it is confined to Greek Life, but as long as you don't expect anything crazy you don't have to be in a frat or sorority to have a good time. I had time about once or twice a week to hang out with friends and sometimes even had a day or two to myself to play video games and study ahead for classes, which I would say is quite decent. Keep in mind I also took a difficult course load and am still on track to a very good GPA, so you definitely have room to push yourself even more than that if you'd like to (or scale back -- we're also very flexible about that). 

For opportunities specifically, I have a research position lined up for this summer into the forseeable future that is on me to figure out if I can give a proper commitment to and it only took 1 email to a PI and 2 hours after it was sent before we got a conversation going. I imagine that outside of the competitive pre-med sphere at WashU that research in other departments will also not be very difficult to seek out. For your situation specifically, Applied Math has a number of faculty who would love to take undergraduates, and there is also applied math / numerical methods work going on in other STEM departments like Biology, Chemistry, Physics, you name it."

For physics, the algebra based sequence doesn’t exist yet or at least is never offered and all majors that currently require physics have to take 191/192 (the calculus based sequence). So it is essentially ghost credit and only gives you units if you only get a 4"
