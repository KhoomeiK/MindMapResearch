apple,fpdus12,t1_fpcdk2v,1588534652.0,"This is a great response! DM me for your code! The colors are actually themes and users can choose them based on which one they prefer. I guess that isn't conveyed properly in the screenshots.

I am working on implementing the RSS reader as it's been a highly requested feature. Siri shortcuts will also be coming soon! Thanks!! üòÅ"
apple,fpdtyuy,t1_fpdp953,1588534183.0,That's a great idea. I'm working on creating playlists for the next big release so I might add this. DM me!

UCSC,fp4d6s5,t1_fp4b22d,1588296541.0,"^^^ yes this isn't UCSC I tried to make that clear. But I hope other professors won't use this as inspiration. 

Edit: And I'm not saying that we should cheat. Rather we should observe the clever tactics this professor used. A lot of my teachers are making their classes really easy this quarter because it's the first time they've have to teach online i.e. open book finals and midterms. By fall quarter, if all professors get comfortable with online classes, then classes wouldn't be as easy as right now."
