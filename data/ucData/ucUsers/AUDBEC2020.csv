ucr,fpn0rjb,t1_fpn0cnu,1588746828.0,Yeah my point is they don’t care. It’s a business and they need to make money off us regardless of the situation. They rely on investment to keep the school growing as we can see by all the money being dumped into all the projects around campus. They’ve spent too much to be able to refund us now.

CPA,fpgujzt,t3_gdejgr,1588609771.0,"For me it’s a process of jumping back from the reading to the MCQs and back to the reading over and over again. Blindly solving MCQs skips an important part of the process, which is reading of the material. Each exam section starts out looking like a ton of information that seems overwhelming and way too much material to ever learn. 

After working the MCQs, my mind starts to pick out the key pieces of information in the readings as I go back and I condense everything down into notes made up of the most important concepts. Once I’m familiar enough with the material to score consistently in the 80s and 90s on MCQs, I take the mock exams and am usually ready to take the real exam at that point."

Were they really simpler times? It may seem that way as we look forward into the unknown, but I don’t think the past was any easier than the current times."
