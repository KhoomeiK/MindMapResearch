UCSC,foz2q6f,t1_fowbao7,1588183680.0,"I’m glad to hear you’re taking this well (despite the challenge of online classes)! My classes are challenging but super interesting so I really can’t complain, plus my professors are very understanding :)"
UCSC,fow3rza,t1_fow28cc,1588112474.0,"I’m sorry to hear that :( please try not to let your experience this quarter influence you to give up on your education though! If you’re having a lot of trouble with classes, maybe you should consider a withdrawal for this quarter (and potentially any other quarters that may be online). I don’t know what the process is/deadlines for withdrawing now, but your mental health always comes first! And it’s okay to not know what’s wrong with you - everyone is handling self isolation differently, and a lot of us are in a state of grieving over the normality we had just a month ago. We’ll all be okay, and i know that when things do return to normal, you’ll be able to pick up your passion for learning again! :)"
UCSC,fow2wtj,t1_fovwmv2,1588112019.0,Santa Cruz misses you too!
UCSC,fovtyd4,t1_fovpawm,1588107474.0,"fuck if I know what week we’re on :( sorry you’re just staring at the wall though, hopefully it is a pretty wall"
UCSC,fovghwf,t1_fovcdek,1588100920.0,"I’m glad it made your day! Avoiding the news and thinking positively about the situations has helped me a lot too. If you’re feeling comfortable enough with your professors, maybe shoot them an email about how it’s difficult to manage the workload for the course during a time like this. Just remind yourself that it’s not your fault you’re drowning! You’re doing the best you can with the situation that’s been handed to you. I believe in you!"
UCSC,fov6bhj,t1_fotdjz2,1588096089.0,"Bro I fucking hate how much engineering students make their entire identity around shitting on other engineering majors bc “their life is so hard” and that other people just wouldn’t understand how hard their life is. It’s so childish to put other major down just because it doesn’t meet your standards of what an intense major is. 

Sure, complain about your classes and talk about how much shit you have to do in your major - everyone does it and it’s healthy. But for the love of god, why does it need to be a fucking competition? And if you’re having such a difficult time, either find something that you’ll complain less about or suck it up and find enjoyment. There is no point in shitting on other people’s majors, whether that be another major in BSOE or a liberal arts major. Just don’t do it, it’s so toxic and immature and it does no good. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
UCSC,fobiu80,t3_g6butv,1587660253.0,You can get a minor in bioinformatics! Good amount of overlap and biologists who have programming/computational experience tend to look better than biologists without those skills. I wouldn’t double though since doubling is super intense and would probably require summer classes.
UCSC,fo0epzr,t1_fo03q0l,1587411770.0,siiick happy birthday!
UCSC,fn2457t,t3_fyv6dl,1586577356.0,"I would check out the bioinformatics major here! I’m biased since that’s my major, but I grappled a lot with what I wanted to do post undergrad (software engineering, medical school, phd for biology) and I found bioinformatics to be the best balance of computer science, biology, chemistry, and math. There’s also a good amount of job security compared to regular biomolecular engineering, and you wouldn’t have to worry about getting into mega impacted classes like CS upper divs."
UCSC,fkwrcx6,t1_fkwqz4i,1584602548.0,You deserve another fern.
