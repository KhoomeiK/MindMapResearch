relationship_advice,foxkwxq,t1_fovzcpz,1588147252.0,"Don’t feel embarrassed for dealing with this for so long. It’s completely normal to feel scared and confused about what to even do in this situation. I (17F) come from an abusive and domestically violent household. I’ve been on the receiving end of every single controlling strategy under the sun and you’re living through that right now. 

It’s hard, to have the perspective to know things are wrong. It’s hard to leave because you’re so tied up in their web of control. The phone calls, the scheduling control, the hours of yelling over the smallest things. 
Even acknowledging that you’re not being treated how you should be is a tremendous step. You should be proud of that. 

OP 
Speaking from experience you’ll make it through this as long as you put your foot down. 
He most likely won’t hurt himself, he’s lying to get attention. My best bet is that he’s a narcissist or bipolar. He will say whatever he needs to say to be treated like the victim and justify his lashing out and treating you like shit. 

Get your things together and leave. Block his number, call the cops on him if he threatens suicide. Don’t let him exert any control over you anymore. 


And most importantly don’t blame yourself for his behavior. Don’t say you should have left sooner or you are embarrassed for putting up with it so long. You’ve been manipulated and you’ve been abused. It’s absolutely natural to react the way you have been. 

Take care of yourself 
It’s a long journey to escape from something like this but I fully believe you can do it.

relationship_advice,foxj168,t3_g9pbol,1588145522.0,"Hello 

I’m a child of a domestically abusive household. My father was narcissistic and cruel with a highly addictive personality (binge drinker).He screamed and yelled and eventually became physically violent with my little brother which is what caused my parents divorce.
In my case though, my brother and I were both old enough to recognize this behavior is unacceptable and to never have a relationship with my Dad again. 

To this day however, my Dad has never apologized or admitted to choking my brother out. He will say he lightly grabbed him, or he pushed him because he “misunderstood” him reaching for the bread basket as him threatening him. 

I would say get out of this relationship immediately. This man is cruel, cold hearted and absolutely capable of hurting a child. He will feel no remorse and claim absolutely no responsibility for his actions. I lived through domestic violence and no child should have to live through that if the signs are there to prevent it before it even starts. 

A baby cannot defend itself like a teenager can. I can’t imagine the worst that can happen.



Also 

Ya know 
Even my father was never cruel to animals no matter how deluded and abusive he was. 
This man is very scary."

I’ve received a lot of response so I can’t promise I’ll have an open spot at this point, but I am keeping in contact with those interested. (As long as they are female.)"
UCI,fordckv,t1_forbuj5,1588010303.0,"You’re exactly right! My math factored that in and even if I spend an addition $100 dollars a month on groceries in an off campus apartment, it’s still a lot cheaper than living on campus.

Also I love to cook so being tied to a meal plan is not something I personally like. 

That’s just what works for me personally though."
UCI,fopztco,t1_fopykr4,1587977812.0,"I am so sorry to hear that. This whole situation has jeopardized so many people’s financial situation and wellbeing. 

Sadly I cannot afford to live on campus at the moment since the cheapest option (which I still couldn’t afford) is not not even available and housing is not guaranteed. 

With everything that is going on right now I’m only reaching out to get information, not jump into any contract or lease without knowing what is going to happen with school (online courses would be very difficult with my major) 

My post is solely about when things would open up completely, and I’d feel confident moving into an apartment. If this is second semester, or next year I don’t know. 
I just don’t want to be caught unprepared and denied housing. 

Thank you for your advice. Personally I find that it’s really easy to get caught up in the idea of ‘finding a solution’ when everything is so crazy right now. Sadly there really are no concrete answers to be had. QwQ 

I’m wishing you the best. 
Stay strong through this!"

teenagers,ev49kxr,t3_chiv6x,1564210121.0,"Hello, girl [16] here., sorry if this is messy I’m on mobile. The question ‘what do you like in a guy’ is incredibly subjective as every girl is going to be different but I can tell you what I personally like in a guy, and why I started dating said guy. 
You see, my boyfriend is a specimen I don’t properly understand. He’s thick as a brick in the head and doesn’t do some of that emotional stuff that I do. He’s not very romantic, he doesn’t surprise me with flowers or cards or things you see all these girls wanting. 
But you see when it comes to things I like about him, none of that fluffy stuff seems important because what truly makes a relationship in my opinion is mutual trust, respect, attraction, and communication. 

I like a guy to be someone I can talk with and hold meaningful conversations, about our interests either shared or exclusive I’ve come to learn more about video games than I thought I would and I enjoy seeing him happy so I don’t mind talking about them or playing them sometimes, honestly it’s really fun. And in turn he now understands and enjoys when I make bad jokes about long dead classical musicians.

I like when a guy thinks about me, and makes meaningful gestures based on conversations we’d had. Like for example three years ago when I was just getting to know him before he was my best friend and eventually my boyfriend, we had a conversation about fairy lore and he showed up and lent me a book the next day that he thought I’d like because it reminded him of that conversation. It was heartfelt and it was kind, and it’s the best feeling in the world when a guy truly cares and has good intentions to just share in your interests. 

I like guys to smell nice and be clean. Which honestly shouldn’t be something you have to say but I know for sure that my teenage brother has not showered in the last three days so like idk if that’s just him or most guys, but deodorant goes a long way just saying. 

I like a guy to be kind, to help people when they need help. To be the one to open the door for the woman struggling with the stroller, or to wait for you while walking so you can tie your shoes. 
It’s the little things that really matter to be honest. 

Obviously the thing I haven’t mentioned yet is attraction, I would advise you that look. Being attractive is a plus, it definitely turns heads, but.. as some of the comments in this thread have already pointed out, it’s not necessarily the outside that really matters to girls. And if it is then they are possibly a bit shallow (not to say that’s always the case sometimes there really is just no physical attraction and that’s a very valid thing.) But if you have that openness and trust with somebody and you truly know them and are able to appreciate them for who they are then that’s the wonderful thing about attraction is, looks don’t really matter at that point do they. 

Also you know ramen and ice cream is a quick way to a woman’s heart, or maybe I’ve got my heart and my stomach confused... 

Okay this is getting long and a bit rambly, I honestly speak too much (;-;). So I don’t know if this was helpful or really what you were looking for with an answer but ima just drop it here. 
If you have any questions I’ll try to reply :3"
