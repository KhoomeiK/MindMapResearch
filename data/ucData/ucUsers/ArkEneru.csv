the *correct* response"
California_Politics,fphrwa3,t1_fphnb8p,1588626682.0,"The thing is, I basically agree with that sentiment. I think we should be prioritizing those social programs, and leaving the extraneous space exploration or military stuff for last. The only reason I'm mentioning the value of a space exploration as a jobs program is because the reality of our political climate is that all of this sweeping social reform must come through compromise -- i.e, using the military, space exploration, or what have you as a vehicle for the real jobs program and UBI that you actually want. I am fundamentally sympathetic to the opposition to the Apollo program, because in an ideal world we would stop people from starving, being ill-clothed, poorly educated or unhoused first through directly funding programs that accomplish those things, (like many countries have already done) but various political forces in our government clearly won't allow us to, for example, cut the funding for the military in half or even simply raise taxes in order to fund these projects. Thus, the question doesn't become whether or not we are willing to fund social programs (because we clearly aren't) but rather which compromise agenda would we most like to have serve as our social reform-vehicle. I, for one, would want it to be anything other than the military -- for example, space travel, random historical complaints notwithstanding, but I would be fine with any cool public works or development-of-humankind type of thing.

Again, yes, its fucked up that we spent so much money on space travel in the 60s when the african american community was suffering. However, its not like it was politically feasible for progressives to just fix systemic racism as soon as they had a 51 percent hold on the government -- nothing short of a revolution and horrible violence would really be able to accomplish change that quickly. What I'm discussing are *reasonable strategies* to get the type of social reform accomplished within our system in the best way possible, not what I would do if I was God or the dictator of the U.S. or something."

worldnews,fpatjz7,t1_fparxde,1588455412.0,"yeah, most of the rest of the world uses . to mean what the us uses to mean , in numbers. i.e. 1,000 is written as 1.000 and 1.5 is written as 1,5. also, thousands can be denoted with a space instead of any punctuation at all (for example one thousand could be 1 000)"

When will reddit learn that the dumbasses that make it into these posts don't represent 'activists' if that even was a demographic. They represent a small minority of *vocal dumbassess* who are really low hanging fruit to make fun of/dunk on, thus are posted on these subreddits disproportionately."

pics,fp0dmmc,t1_fp0d6nt,1588207236.0,its unfortunately nothing so simple. there is a significant sentiment among the reddit right and extreme right wing that believes that transgender communities exist for the purpose of 'converting' more people to become transgender or worse that they are grooming them sexually. what we see here is one of those types trying to proselytize his extremist beliefs outside of their hate group.

todayilearned,fozi9qb,t1_foy37w4,1588191112.0,"Yes, he was Jewish religiously. How could he not be? The bible wouldn't be written until the late first century, decades after Jesus' death. Jesus preached that he was the messiah of the Jews -- i.e. he followed Judaism, even if he claimed to embody the next period of that religion. Its not like Jesus knew that his followers would form a new and separate religion distinct from Judaism after he died. He was referred to as 'rabbi' and his followers for a significant period after his death were considered to follow a sect of Judaism. Most historians recognize that the formal split between Jews and Jewish Christians (i.e, the sect of Judaism which believed Christ was the messiah which would eventually form the foundation of Christianity) occurred around the late first century. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Christian"

Do you really think we'll ever get to a point where people *won't* allow themselves to be manipulated?

The only way I see this ending is for the U.S. to stop being the target of foreign interference. As long as someone wants to interfere with our elections, they're going to be able to do so. Politically, we've been checkmated. We either let ourselves get interfered with forever, or we stop being the target (in other words, a threat to their goals)"
