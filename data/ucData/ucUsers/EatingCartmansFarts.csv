And given the housing circumstances that put, I hope not. If they on campus rooms max at doubles, load will move to off campus housing, which will cause housing prices to go up, and  make things very unaffordable for a lot of people. It's already fucking ridiculous that a run down 1 bedroom will cost ya $2500/month."

malefashionadvice,fokcv5d,t1_fok8378,1587839704.0,Yeah! That's what I was thinking of doing with the t shirts
malefashionadvice,fok72ez,t3_g7x0gg,1587836602.0,"How bad is it to use top load washer with agitator for washing designer t-shirts(Burberry, Balmain, etc..) and sweaters? I just got back into designer clothes and my apartment has a top load dryer with an agitator. Is it really that bad for clothes? Haven't worn any of my new clothes yet."
