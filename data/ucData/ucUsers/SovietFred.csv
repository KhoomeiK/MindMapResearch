I saw there was a 3600 cl16 set of the same type of ram for $10 more but I wasn’t sure of the difference. Noted I’ll update that.

I could reuse the hyper evo 212 I already have if the stock cooler is weak like you say(I’m assuming that’s the wraith stealth), it just needs a new clip on fan because the current one broke.

For the gpu maybe a MSI GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 6 GB VENTUS XS OC Video Card?"
