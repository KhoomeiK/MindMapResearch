berkeley,fpfq0jp,t1_fpfjpws,1588579352.0,Ahh I see. That is a fair option. Good luck with that!
berkeley,fpfgyko,t3_gd2ukk,1588570940.0,Why not take another more interesting course and use it for the credits you are trying to use Math 110 for? Unless I am misunderstanding the situation.
berkeley,fpe02fg,t1_fpcgd73,1588537671.0,This person is an imposter. Don't listen to them.

StarWarsLeaks,fp55555,t1_fp5539q,1588316627.0,Thank you!
StarWarsLeaks,fp552ye,t3_g1idy1,1588316570.0,Can someone link it? Can't get access to it :(
berkeley,fooqkkd,t3_g8oagd,1587944358.0,"CS + Stats. However, the advice I hear from people who have taken this path is that you shouldn't do it unless you actually like both of them a lot. You may find yourself annoyed with one of the majors and wishing you were working on the other one more.

 If your goal is grad school, majoring in one and taking interesting/useful classes in the other is a legit option. I don't think you necessarily need to do a double major, but someone can correct me if I am wrong. 

I was going to do the CS minor, but then I realized I don't want to take 61C lol (also I'd have to take extra upper-div CS classes that I am not interested in)."
berkeley,fokom16,t3_g7oe2h,1587845992.0,Math 54 isn't too bad (keep in mind that I am not exactly a math god or anything). Read the textbook (it is REALLY good) and take the SLC adjunct with Branden. 61B is just a grind. Both are doable for sure.
berkeley,foefbgn,t3_g71h7y,1587702372.0,"Oh don't worry, we're still getting outages here in the bay. Brings me back to a more normal time..."
berkeley,fodcmt9,t3_g6vwbk,1587683006.0,"If in-person is an option, I'll probably just drive from home tbh"
berkeley,fo5xbbi,t3_g5vw8f,1587538773.0,"I had to retake Lin Alg/Diff Eq. (Math 54) to establish a Math GPA and be able to declare here. I am guessing that's not the case for civil engineering, but as you can see, it is something that happens."
berkeley,fo558xk,t3_g5ovz0,1587517784.0,"Consider taking Stat 33B too. I am in it right now and you really don't need much coding experience to do it (In fact, it's probably doable with no coding experience). The course is pretty easy  and takes up like 1-3 hours a week, depending on if I have an assignment or not.

Solid 1 unit course for sure. Idk if Nick Ulle is teaching 33A/B again, but he is a good lecturer."
berkeley,fo3x9hm,t3_g5b569,1587494500.0,I am! PM me if you need another one haha
berkeley,fo0ytyw,t3_g4zv7p,1587422374.0,"Hey! I transferred last Fall and have had 0 issues getting math, stats, Data Science, and lower-div cs classes so far. Transfers get decent registration times, so I wouldn't worry too much about that."
PrequelMemes,fnxfxbk,t1_fnxffe9,1587337803.0,I think it's because that cut before the fight kept playing over and over again everytime we died in that fight or something like that ahaha
Tinder,fnr925o,t1_fnr2dbb,1587182335.0,But does it count if it's only fellatio?
berkeley,fnq7tl7,t3_g3b08r,1587159342.0,"I don't think they can really do that when so many people need the semester to graduate on schedule and it would significantly effect a lot of peoples' post-grad plans. 

Personally, I am heavily considering taking the next semester off, as it seems more and more likely that we will be online this Fall."
berkeley,fnq7dkx,t3_g38eew,1587159096.0,Good luck guys! Was definitely an exciting time for me a year ago and I hope you guys get to have that experience too! :)
berkeley,fnnxf4m,t1_fnnshnc,1587104746.0,hmm I have it all enabled on Chrome ;_;. Guess I am just cursed
berkeley,fnnbg72,t1_fnn4yzi,1587088592.0,"Hmm, I'm on Chrome. Fuck it, I'll try and figure it out now.

Edit: My cookies are definitely fine. Idk what is going on.

berkeley,fnn2jrc,t3_g2ot6f,1587083045.0,My laptop makes me reauthenticate everytime I login and it literally never had this issue until like 3 weeks ago. FML. Definitely ticked off remember me too.

YangForPresidentHQ,fn86g6t,t1_fn63ere,1586734913.0,"I don't want to speak out of my ass, but I remember reading that if Taiwan stops claiming the mainland, it opens the door for the mainland to forcefully take them and for other countries to step in? Idk, that doesn't sound right, but it was something that would be disastrous."
YangForPresidentHQ,fn55618,t1_fn4dpv0,1586656180.0,"Doesn't the Taiwanese government claim mainland China as well. Neither considers themselves separate, at least not officially, if I recall correctly."

berkeley,fn1layg,t1_fn0sg6a,1586564443.0,61A is a huge time commitment over the Summer. I recommend you focus on your internship and excel there.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fmz04xm,t1_fmyzb5x,1586501486.0,"Ahh, I respect it"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fmyumy2,t1_fmyds25,1586496267.0,"Maybe it was just my Little Caesar's, but that pretzel crust was salty as fuck. Also way too greasy, but I guess that's everything at Little Caesar's hehe"
berkeley,fmysfsx,t1_fmyphj5,1586494388.0,Good list! I don't think they offer STAT 159 anymore unfortunately. I'm assuming the Data Science department's offerings are comprehensive enough that it is repetitive.
berkeley,fmyoien,t1_fmyn3do,1586491278.0,"Wait what the heck, I had no idea 144 was a thing. It looks really interesting. I might just take it next semester. Thanks homie!"

berkeley,fmcwpew,t3_fufcxn,1585954359.0,I highly recommend! It was always annoying hitting the limit when reading articles posted on Reddit.
