But normal internships that aren't limited to any specific grade will probably not ask you. I highly doubt raising B+ to an A- would make any difference though"

If this article specifically was referring to that, then it would make much more sense, but it makes no sense in this case and comes off as extremely off-putting to people of every other minority group"

csMajors,fni08cb,t1_fnhllgn,1586971779.0,Yeah it definitely became more interesting once you're done with all the basic fundamental classes and move onto the upper level courses. CS just has so many subfields that it's pretty hard to not at least find a few interesting.

csMajors,fnfw9eq,t3_g1c0sx,1586916813.0,"> Is it advisable to spend a semester or two studying something you're a bit less interested in, hoping to snowball interest in that subject and enjoy the far more flexible careers that it provides?

In my biased opinion, yes.

I chose cs over chemE early on in my career & have not regretted it all. I feel like if you put the same amount of effort into a traditional engineering degree as you do into a cs degree, you will be better off career-wise with the cs degree the majority of the time, and I think the sacrifice of studying something that might not be as interesting to you (don't even know if this is true yet) in order to have a more comfortable life is worth it.

EDIT: Should be ""put same amount of effort into a cs degree as you do in a traditional engineering degree"""

Also, having one B after 2 years of classes (assuming 2 years since you're already in college and transfer season already passed I think) should not be a big deal at all if you well in all of your other classes. GPA isn't the end all be all either; you also have standardized tests and extracurriculars so don't stress too much about this one letter grade"

Also, maybe consider cutting ties with this ""friend"". People who take shit like this to their public social media are usually pretty toxic (and it seems like this is the case considering her irrational reaction)"
