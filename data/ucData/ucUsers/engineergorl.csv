Dunning-Kruger effect in practice right here, peeps. Maybe you should take your own advice and do more research. I had a nice laugh reading this thread and seeing you quintuple down on your stupidity."

I'm surprised he didn't run earlier tbh. he's very qualified to be EVP. I'm pretty sure he interned for the EVP office in the past years & he 100% knows the responsibilities and duties of the office.

I'm sure he wants to work in politics/be a politician someday, and given that one of the things the EVP does is go to Washington DC to do advocacy and meet politicians, organizers, lobbyists, etc., this is a great opportunity for him."

ucla,foaiidt,t3_g5uw64,1587647121.0,"I'm a CS major myself, and I work as a programmer in the Humanities department developing for Google Sheets, so this is right up my alley. I honestly think that for the amount of effort and time your proposed software is going to take to develop, it's not really worth it. Yes, there are lots of CS majors eager for resume builders, but software development is not something where X more people means you get X times as much output. For the scope of what you're proposing, this project sounds like it would take more than a year (more than a USAC president's term). How would you make sure it's not abandoned after you leave office if you're elected? 

Furthermore, if you do succeed in creating the software, how many students would really be interested in parsing the piecemeal expenditures like food? I think the big, big picture is enough: who's spending the money and how much and how much allocated money is actually spent, and just getting this would make the project a lot more feasible to do in a year."

relationship_advice,fo26bg1,t3_g4ws1j,1587451112.0,"Being Asian and coming from an extremely family-oriented culture, I don't understand why people do this. I don't want to generalize, but Americans,....why!? Look, in this economy, kicking your kids out at 18 isn't going to ""teach them a life lesson"" or some ""they need to learn how to be independent!"" nonsense. Your husband is saying your son needs to ""handle life on his own"". When you and your husband get old, I bet this is exactly what your son will say back to you.

I suggest you follow the Asian family playbook:

\- support the kids through college as long as they get a degree that will pay for itself (having them graduate with no student debt is ideal, but I understand 4 years of tuition+housing can get expensive, but remember 2 years community college + 2 years at a state school w/ in-state tuition is also a cheaper option)

\- while in college, kids focus on building their resume

\- as long as kids are getting a good GPA and building their resume, they don't need to get a part-time job

\- kids graduate with a college degree, move back in with parents to save money, and get a job that pays more than minimum wage, and then basically start saving like crazy for a house downpayment, car, etc.

\- kids have little to no student debt, and in a couple years, have a lot of savings & can afford the downpayment for a house & so kids have a great financial situation in their 20's

\- kids get the parents' old cars, which saves even more money

This is how you ensure your kids and your grandkids get a great life and build generational ""wealth""."

ucla,fnhwkjz,t1_fngf772,1586970053.0,"Reddit isn’t protesting the creation of a black community center. We’re not opposed to the referendum because of the black community center, but because the increase in student fees comes at a really bad time & there’s no way USAC needs that much money to establish the black community center. We would rather USAC reallocate the money they haven’t spent yet (which is a lot according to a last Reddit post) or spend a portion of its reserves    to fund the black community center."
