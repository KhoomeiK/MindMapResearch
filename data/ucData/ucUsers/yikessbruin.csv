ucla,fnijowd,t1_fni9kla,1586981166.0,"It's pretty clear that they're making fun of him, singling him out on the basis of being the only stem major. Robert liked the tweet. Like come on."
ucla,fni8l2j,t1_fni7pic,1586975811.0,"OH and i forgot omg, his argument was also that this referendum could be more specific to keep students informed on what they're actually paying for. He talked about how student consent is important and a lot of students dont know wtf is happening with the $. If anyone wants to add on more of what they heard please do."
ucla,fni8g3z,t1_fni7pic,1586975744.0,"His first response, which is what i listened to, was that he said the council doesn't need to ""stand united"" on this referendum because he wants the students to know that they have a choice in this, which is important because ""they're the ones actually paying for this"". He also said how he thinks the black student resource center/ muslim prayer space is important, regardless. He also said he's abstaining bc he's running as president rn and doesn't want to push people to vote any certain way. 

This dude legitimately had the patience of a saint. They should make it so that the WHOLE meeting stays available for everyone to hear. I'm sure he said other stuff after, but I didn't stay for that."

what do you all have to say about this total bullying of Orion? Why is this okay? This is the most un-Democratic, group mob highschool garbage ever. Those headass tweets? Why are those okay? This is why almost no one on this site will be voting as you want coming May 4th. Why is it okay to imply Orion is racist, WE'RE racist, because some of us can't afford this new fee hike IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. PEOPLE HAVE NO JOBS. Like wtf."
ucla,fnhnm83,t1_fngonl4,1586965654.0,"You said it so well. The fact that the rest of these asses are framing US as RACIST for not supporting this increase in fee is fucking gross lmao. The average student already pays USAC over $1000 over our 4 years. We pay them $85 per quarter. Orion really is representing all of us. He represents those suffering from this global pandemic. He represents those who can't pay fees on top of fees. He represents everything these headasses hate, which is his REFUSAL TO CONFORM to their group.

&#x200B;

BTW: On their twitter, they made fun of him for being the only STEM major in the council. Lol?"
ucla,fnhmxuw,t3_g1u22m,1586965318.0,It starts may 4th!!! on myUCLA
ucla,fnhmtkq,t3_g1m2oo,1586965259.0,"Don't you know? We're all racist, apperantly. USAC said so. Because some of us can't afford an extra $45 in the middle of a pandemic, on top of the $85 PER QUARTER WE ALREADY PAY THEM"
