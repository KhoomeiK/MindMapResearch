UCI,fpm6j0e,t1_fpl4pn8,1588726574.0,Thanks for the update!
UCI,fpjhhj0,t1_fpjh1j9,1588668670.0,I haven't figured that part out yet either. But i'm planning on calling the summer session office tomorrow to ask if its through Zot Account or the summer session website.
UCI,fpjer65,t3_gdlt9m,1588665823.0,"I have the same issue and its my first time doing summer session as well. I called and the best thing I was told is to pay upfront and then ask for a refund later. I also saw some students talking about how some of the aid is not confirmed until mid-May. I've emailed financial aid but they haven't responded and I called the summer session office, but they can't really answer any questions on financial aid. So I've decided to email them again."
UCI,fpjdx4x,t3_gdssrd,1588664979.0,"I'm assuming you're an incoming freshman. If you can't change your major through your portal then there are prerequisites that you have to complete before being able to declare business economics: Math 2A, Math 2B, Econ 20A, and Econ 20B. Calculus ab or bc pretty much translates to Math 2A and Math 2B respectively, so to answer your question on "" do i take calc ab for one quarter then bc for the next or??"", yes you take two quarter of calculus. 

It is possible to change you major long as your GPA is above a 2.0 and you complete the prerequisites with no grade lower than a C. 

For advice, I recommend that you take Pluta for your Math 2B class, Econ 20a online with Branch, and Aggarwal for Econ 20B.  You can also google the school of social sciences website and get more information from there. Down below are basically just informational documents. 

This is a link is a summary of all the courses you take:  [https://www.economics.uci.edu/undergrad/major/business.php](https://www.economics.uci.edu/undergrad/major/business.php)

UCI,fpbiiu8,t3_gcfox0,1588470802.0,"When I started to dread classes within the major instead of looking forward to them. As a freshman who wanted to pursue engineering or biology, I couldn't bring myself to take classes in physics or chemistry because I realized I had completely lost interest in pursuing a career in STEM. As a Biz. Ecom major all the classes I have taken have come with some degree of difficulty but I still look forward to the learning process and the fresh starts at the beginning of each quarter even if my grades don't always result in the way I want them to. I decided to stick with my major when I felt like I was making progress towards a career I could see myself in a couple years down the road."
UCI,fozmh2i,t1_foym9cx,1588193124.0,Thank you!
UCI,foxl3si,t1_foxj7yh,1588147429.0,"Thank you! It is for Middle Earth Attendant position. I am a second yr. I currently have an internship under campus rec., but I guess I wasn't sure if high school experiences are still relevant?"
UCI,fox6tb1,t1_fox5cms,1588135507.0,"Transferring into the the Business Admin major at UCI is very difficult. Per year they only allow 10 current students into the major. On the other hand, you can also declare Business Econ which is relatively easier to declare. To declare business econ you would have to take Econ 20A/20B as well as Math 2A/2B. 

UCI and UCSB are both great schools by the way."
UCI,fox43eb,t3_ga1l4o,1588133596.0,What your current major at UCI?
UCI,fotqifw,t1_fotp7ma,1588062533.0,"Sorry but I can't help you there. I had to take the long way of declaring Biz. Econ so I had to request a change of major through University Registrar. I'm not sure what the process look like for incoming freshman, but I would recommend to contact the office of Undeclared/Undecided advising, the School of Social Sciences, or try the Office of Admissions. Good luck!"
UCI,fotp81o,t3_g9c7te,1588061241.0,"I am not an Art Major, but from what I have seen art majors do have a presence at UCI. There are multiple art shows per yr as well as several clubs that focus on art. I believe you can minor in anything you want as long as no more than either 1 or 2 classes overlap with your major. If you're looking to minor in something in business, then UCI offers accounting, innovation and entrepreneurship, economics, and business economics."
UCI,fotp095,t3_g9cjy7,1588061022.0,"I declared Biz Econ at the end of my first year.  I wouldn't say the major is impacted but it seems that Biz. Econ becomes a lot of peoples second choice of major. If you're unable to change your major through your portal then you're going to have to meet the pre-reqs of Math 2A/2B and Econ 20A/20B. In terms of professors I would recommend Pluta for Math 2B, Aggarwal for Econ 20B, and Branch for Econ 20A."
UCI,fohr8l5,t1_fohfzgl,1587771098.0,Thank you! I will definitely give myself more time to study and read the textbook for upcoming exams.
UCI,fohmoq6,t1_fohcsx2,1587768534.0,"Thanks for the heads up. It isn't fully graded yet, but my score for the multiple choice alone was barely a C, and I don't believe I did any better with the free response."
UCI,foekb5b,t1_foeg00i,1587706037.0,"Yeah, that one."
UCI,fodg2ra,t1_fo9yrga,1587684246.0,"Next to HOME, placing your mouse over NEWS will give you the option of Campus News or City News. Click on Campus News and if you scroll down there will be various articles about ASUCI."
UCI,fntegtx,t1_fnsnzgw,1587240019.0,"Word of Advice: Regardless of whether or not a major might be considered ""cutthroat"", that doesn't mean that Pharm Sci will either be an easy or difficult major for you. Most majors require you take really difficult classes as well as relatively easier ones. Trying to figure out if a major is ""cutthroat"" is not really going to help you make your decision of switching majors any less easy. Before switching majors, think about how well you do in science courses that focus on physics, biology, and chemistry.

If you want to find out more about the school, programs, and requirements make sure to go to their website. The website should give you more information on how to switch.

In terms of minors, you can minor in anything the school offers, but I believe there can not be more than 1 or 2 classes that overlap with your major. UCI offers Accounting, Business Economics, Economics, and Innovation and Entrepreneurship."
UCI,f8nkgdm,t1_f6rofmm,1574646197.0,What's your professors name? I am looking to minor in Intl. Studies and there is currently only one professor available for INTL 1.
