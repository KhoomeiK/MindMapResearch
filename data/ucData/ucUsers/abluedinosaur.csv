The good thing is that during the summer, you can read up on the material for your fall classes and the same with winter break if you want.

Learn what study techniques have worked well for you. Take a schedule that works for you. If you need an extra semester to graduate, that's okay. As long as you pace yourself and give a good effort, I definitely believe you will graduate with a CE degree from one of the best schools in the country. Good luck!"

You will need an excellent GPA and have to grind the MCAT and go through years of schooling after graduation.

If you want to go down this path, that's great, but I just want to make sure you think about what you are giving up and what you have to go through going forward. Don't change your path if you think this might just be a fad interest. I personally felt more interested in public health, but I am still graduating and going into computer science."

However, they can get many of the same jobs (CS would be harder to get hardware jobs though), and in the computer security club for example, it's difficult to tell who is a CE and who is a CS major.

If you're interested in hardware, go CE, if you're interested in just software, go CS. I would say CS is a bit more prestigious if that matters, although it probably shouldn't."
