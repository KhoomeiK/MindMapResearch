ucla,fp4o9qx,t1_fp4nlfu,1588303436.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you :( this pandemic is really revealing all the flaws in this government and the people impacted by the consequences the worst are those in compromised positions from finances or health. With basically 0 support from the government you can't blame you or others for feeling they need to keep working, and then this happens. Stay strong and hang in there! Sending you best wishes"
