longhair,fpmdv3v,t3_ge9qtw,1588730923.0,What shampoo and conditioner do you use ? Your hair is so beautiful !!!!!!!!!!! I have extremely fine (texture) hair and the only way it’s long is if I put up with the split ends. How often do you shampoo and what is your hair texture ? Thanks

If you aren’t in a super rush for organizing items ROMWE has amazing and super cheap organizing stuff -like omg I just discovered it the other day, placed an order of 48 items !!!! Shipping is FREE for over $10 and tracked shipping is FREE for over $20. I cannot tell you enough how much organization stuff there is for CHEAP !!! Go to the home section and they add new stuff 3x a week. Good luck with your decluttering!"
ReportTheBadModerator,fpmbz5i,t3_gdznj2,1588729784.0,I don’t think this is fair AT all! I see people bully others on subs all the time and not even get a warning and you post 21% most likely helpful info and they ban you? Seems like one of the mods had a weird personal issue with you rather than you actually doing anything wrong
Ebay,fpm9nxk,t1_fpm9kav,1588728408.0,Oh ok thanks

AsianBeauty,fpm5cgu,t1_fplpq9h,1588725888.0,Thanks for the review bc I have been wanting to try this! I just ordered my first bottle of SK-II during the Sephora sale. I got the little set with the 2.5 oz bottle and the 1 oz of water lotion (whatever that is lol). Now when I was shopping for my sunscreens I saw this one on YesStyle but it was sold out. Plus I was still deciding.

yoga,fpm43nr,t1_fpm3gqi,1588725158.0,You are on some rant that really says way more about you than anyone else including the op. You are not the body police- and you can knock off the fake concern for her health because what you’re really doing is pushing people away from feeling safe to post on this sub. I think that’s very low vibe behavior and it’s not going to be tolerated. Become a dietitian if you feel it’s some calling to chat with others on their bodies -but until then sush !!!
yoga,fpm38h7,t1_fpm0pza,1588724654.0,"Seriously, comment far less !!  You are a bully and oh so tough trash talking people you don’t even know online. Leave her alone !"
yoga,fpm3191,t1_fplq4fm,1588724536.0,Your goal should be to stop bullying others. I have no idea why you think the hate is appropriate! Leave her alone!!!
yoga,fpltxe6,t1_fplq7n6,1588719401.0,"Excuse you, don’t bring my religion into this- that’s a cheap shot and it’s actually not allowed in this sub. Also every being is sentient, and worthy of compassion and love-that’s why I stuck up for OP. You seem troubled to keep trying to bully others for how they look. I hope you find peace but I think you should take a break from Reddit until you can be more polite."
AirBnB,fpljqai,t1_fplbz8p,1588713944.0,"That’s super generous! Plus they will be able to collect unemployment and get the bonus $600 each week through July-still feel bad for them though 😟

Edit: sorry my comment posted before I was done typing !"
Sephora,fplhtdp,t1_fpl47nd,1588712961.0,I agree with you !! Except the most current one she only returned like 7% of her orders so I felt bad for her.

Sephora,fpkb54g,t1_fpf8b6v,1588691448.0,"Your comment comes off super catty and not that constructive. Her return rate is 7% based on her numbers-it’s not perfect, and it’s not technically low, but it’s reasonable. I don’t think 20 items is a lot based on how many she’s bought overall."
Sephora,fpkanr5,t1_fpb5oh9,1588691191.0,"I can’t believe you got downvoted, that’s utterly ridiculous they are banning you. That’s a little more than a 7% return rate- which isn’t perfect but it’s realistic given how much you spend."
Sephora,fpka7uy,t1_fpbbryc,1588690950.0,Please let us know how you like the skin fix !!
crafts,fpk52dt,t3_gds1kb,1588688142.0,Wow !! That is spot on
yoga,fpk4ys7,t1_fpjnbew,1588688086.0,"You’re coming from a helpful place-not a mean spirited one, that much is true. But the OP didn’t ask for any weight loss advice and that may not even be a goal for her- which is completely fine. She only asked about body placement within the pose -so you may want to modify your comment to reflect what was specifically asked. Also some people could have a medical issue they are navigating, and so weight loss or weight gain might not be possible for them at the moment. Some people can rightfully be offended if you give advice that wasn’t asked because it can hurt peoples feelings."
glossier,fpk4a5o,t3_gc791t,1588687696.0,You look so pretty !!!

It does get easier and more comfortable the more you practice ! Just make sure that you’re not hyper extending your elbows (it doesn’t look like you are -just wanted to mention that). If you get tired in downward facing dog you can seamlessly transition to child’s pose on your mat, then pop back up again when you feel restored !!!"

pics,fpia192,t1_fphzw7h,1588636663.0,"Yes !!! Sometimes these bills aren’t correct esp if you went to NYU Langone Hospitals -their billing department is nuts. I had two lifesaving kidney surgeries in 2017 (in the same month) and my bill they sent me was $108,311 USD- LMAO the actual amount I had to pay was under $100 with my insurance. And they sent that bill (it was several of them put together) 3x !!!"

Sephora,fpi99j4,t3_gdh1i2,1588636220.0,I agree with this with ONE exception -people who get banned by Sephora-those posts can be entertaining. But all those other type questions need to be bundled up. 👍

AskNYC,fpgh4qm,t3_gdb559,1588602597.0,"Short answer :NYC is closed for all of May 

Long Answer: Every time they extend the bag ban-the pushed back dates always line up with the new pushed back dates for “reopening”. Probably on 11 or 12 May they will tell us “NYC closed until 1 June except for limited construction projects”. Then prior to mid June- we will get pushed to 15 June. Keep in mind they are giving the $600 bonus on unemployment THROUGH JULY! This is so larger cities can stay closed through June if needed to lessen the death toll infection rate. I don’t really see NYC up and going until end of June/early July."

chickens,fpecs6k,t1_fpeafn5,1588544955.0,Yikes! Freezer Camp ? How about a proper burial. I just don’t understand how you can judge people that speed up around chickens when you also murder animals? I mean it’s not really a “grey area” killing other sentient beings who also desire to live (when you’re able to rationalize as a human) is very mean. I thought we were in agreement here about that? I am so shocked you eat chickens but think these other drivers are mean.
