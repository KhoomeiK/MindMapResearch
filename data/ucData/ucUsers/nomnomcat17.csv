NoStupidQuestions,fp4s2bd,t1_fp4l9zc,1588305966.0,Interesting. I guess this is all a result of Windows just not enforcing any control over the installation/uninstallation of applications (otherwise it could help keep track of shared files and stuff).

infp,foixcoo,t3_g7l1a4,1587800235.0,"If you find yourself being lazy and unmotivated, it‚Äôs probably one of the following:

1. You‚Äôre burnt out. This is hard to deal with, and I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve figured it out either.
2. You‚Äôre just not interested in whatever you‚Äôre studying. If this is the case, I would suggest trying to find a different field of study you enjoy more if it‚Äôs not too late. It might help keeping yourself motivated when you have a lot of work.
3. You‚Äôve got a fixed mindset. You‚Äôre studying because you want to get the degree, and get a job. Instead, try to have a growth mindset. Study because you‚Äôre interested, and you want to learn more. You‚Äôd probably be surprised if at how many things you‚Äôd find interesting if you keep an open mind. This is just a suggestion, however. It‚Äôs perfectly valid if you‚Äôre just going through college to graduate and get a job afterward, so it‚Äôs really up to you to make a decision about what you want in life.

From reading your post, I think your biggest problem is probably #3. If you love to read and learn already, use that to your advantage! Take studying to be a chance for you to learn more. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre majoring in, but whatever it is, know that studying doesn‚Äôt have to be monotonous. Study by learning more than you have to ‚Äî not by reviewing what you already know.

For example, if you‚Äôre studying something in the humanities, ask questions beyond what you‚Äôre assigned to. The internet exists, and you can find pretty much anything and everything there. If you‚Äôre studying something in STEM, do the same. A lot of people hate math, but in reality, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre only exposed to dry and meaningless formulas. Look further ‚Äî how did people come up with this? If you do so, there‚Äôs a lot of hidden beauty (in every subject really, this was just an example). And conveniently, if you study to learn more, the grades will follow.

And lastly, just know that you can be a hard worker. It might be harder for us INFPs to stay on top of things, but again, it definitely doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be a hard worker. You‚Äôd be surprised what you can do when you put your mind to it.

Sorry if this comment is all over the place. It‚Äôs late and I‚Äôm about to head to sleep, but I hope it was helpful :‚Äô)."
infp,foivoni,t3_g7nvrt,1587798577.0,"I find emotional intelligence attractive. I don‚Äôt think I could find myself attracted to someone without a high EQ, I have so many feelings that I need someone who can understand me. As for general intelligence, I still care because I do like having deeper and more meaningful conversations, but I think it‚Äôs a lot more important to me for someone to have an open mind than to be ‚Äúintelligent.‚Äù Also, if I may digress, as someone other people would consider ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù, I hate the idea of intelligence. You‚Äôre assigning someone a static label that is so general it can‚Äôt possibly describe just how complex we are. Everyone is smart in their own ways."

ucla,fnwnfb6,t3_g4cju0,1587321730.0,"IMO Corbin's more of a lecturer than a teacher. His lectures are really good and if you're actually focusing on learning why he is presenting the material in the way he is, you'll get a LOT better at physics. If your mindset is focused on getting a certain letter grade for your transcript (not that this is invalid), you're going to hate that you're ""memorizing"" confusing derivations to prepare for tests. I'd argue that Corbin's whole teaching philosophy revolves around you not mindlessly memorizing equations in comparison to other physics classes.

That being said, there's definitely a certain amount of interest in physics required to make the most of his class. Think of Corbin like a really good textbook, and learn to be your own teacher."

mbti,fmykejl,t1_fmy948q,1586488299.0,I thought your type having a P meant that you prefer perceiving over judging? Which is why J types are generally more organized and P types are more spontaneous? Do we tend to be portrayed more by our extraverted functions over our introverted functions?
mbti,fmyj9iz,t1_fmyalct,1586487501.0,"Hmm. I think this answers my question the best, thanks. So N/S is a perceiving function, and F/T is a judging function? That means that N/S is related to information gathering, and F/T is related to structure. Which is why J types will have a stronger extraverted judging function (Fe/Te) and P types will have a judging introverted perceiving (Fi/Ti) function (and the other way for judging functions)? Does that mean that P/J determines which function is extraverted and which function is introverted? And the one you ""prefer"" is the extroverted one?

Like how INFP ""prefers"" information gathering, so it'll have Ne (since N is related to gathering info)?? And since an INFP is overall introverted, it's dominant function will be it's main introverted function, Fi? But why is the INFP's main function a judging function if they're a perceiving type?

I think it's starting to make sense but I'm not sure if I'm understanding this correctly, lol. (Sorry I don't think this really makes sense... I'm kinda just rambling feel free to ignore me lol)"
