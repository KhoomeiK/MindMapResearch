infj,fo7ftrx,t3_g5pmxb,1587577611.0,Have you tried having an accountability buddy? I tried it for a few days and it really helped. You just have a friend or roommate and you text or tell each other when you are starting a task and complete the task. I find I stay more accountable when someone else knows I should be working on that task. You also will feel motivated when you can tell someone else that you finished a task or to hear that they accomplished a task.

CasualConversation,fn915oa,t1_fn77c92,1586756060.0,"Yeah, I like hitching a ride with a friend to the grocery story every once in a while, but it’s so stressful. When I’m by myself, I can walk through the aisles: comparing prices and seeing if anything inspires me to make a recipe or is on sale. I make a list before I go in, but sometimes you just gotta see what make the most sense in the moment. I can compare prices (there are so many tortillas and tomato options). I like to take a good look at the clearance/sales rack, too. But my friends usually takes half as long, so I feel like I’m racing to get the bare essentials and skimming through the prices as fast as I can."

BALLET,fmy98pz,t1_fmy2lez,1586480877.0,"\^\^Ditto on this comment about adjustable barres. Sturdiness is always more important

&#x200B;

Although like Kate said if you can make a sturdy collapsible barre that would be great more space efficiency, especially now that some online classes included center combos. 

&#x200B;

Double barres are useful in a studio setting where multiple ages are taking classes. However, for my own personal barre, I would prefer one height. Once you get to an advanced level and start doing turns at the barre or using your inside leg, then the lower barre just becomes a knee buster."
