I didn't give them a chance for a long time, but I'm starting to understand their music now. Bullet The Blue Sky is spectacular!"
Music,fp4pdc5,t1_fp4nkov,1588304156.0,Zero Seven! Great list
Music,fp4p91a,t1_fp4mj4v,1588304077.0,I know a few songs by him and I can definitely feel the vine the whole album would give off
Music,fp4p2z4,t1_fp4m8gs,1588303968.0,"Lol, this sentence out of context is strange..."
Music,fp4p076,t1_fp4lzvg,1588303919.0,"I was about -1 when it originally came out, so late teens early 20s was a good time for me to discover that album."
Music,fp4oskv,t3_gb4kzr,1588303779.0,"Note sure how others feel about this choice, but Coheed and Cambria's Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV... got me through some money times. If listen to that album front to back, often!"
Music,fp4ogao,t1_fp4kwws,1588303556.0,Thank you for listing Manchester Orchestra! Simple Math and Means Everything To Nothing are high on my list. Absolutely love this band.
Music,fp4ob52,t1_fp4km7g,1588303461.0,I'm surprised that this is the first incubus album I've seen listed. Good choice

Music,fp4gm3y,t1_fp4ghhy,1588298614.0,Totally agree with Wish You Were Here. Others were suggesting The Wall and I kept thinking of this album.

Music,fp4ffng,t1_fp48tmg,1588297890.0,"OK Computer, for sure! I almost added that instead of In Rainbows. I think OK Comp had a more succinct emotion/feel."
Music,fp4f6ht,t1_fp47pdh,1588297737.0,More than one person has listed Andreas Vollenweider. I'll have to listen to him.

Music,fp408a0,t1_fp3zjn6,1588289141.0,Is there any good fuck-the-system rock bands these days? Like System and RATM in the 90's/00's ? I miss that vibe.

Music,fp3ugsf,t1_fp3r1tb,1588286025.0,Older Cold War Kids has a bit more of an improv feel than newer Cold War Kids. Loyalty to Loyalty (2008) is another album by them that has some cool tracks too.

houseplants,fnulc3n,t1_fnuiz8z,1587264852.0,"I live in SD, so I don't need to use AC or heat, like ever. So my house is always relatively humid - my hydrometer says 45 - 50% regularly. Additionally, I spray the leaves at least once a week, sometimes even twice a week, with a spray bottle to give it extra moisture. 
The pot is placed on the perimeter of a East-facing window, so it gets a good amount of indirect light, but never ever gets full sun. 
Most people in my circle of friends don't spray their plants as much as I do. It may take extra work, but I think it's my secret formula :) 
Best of luck!"
