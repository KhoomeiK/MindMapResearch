berkeley,fpm1us3,t3_ge4hes,1588723850.0,"i imagine that your experience this year is not as largely tied to cal as it is to the acclimation of first year

establishing close knit relationships in a large space like cal is hard

cal is really hard - agreed and not sure if ucla will be easier (?)

if you decide you want to transfer, you want to consider the time cost of adjusting to a new environment again. you can also view it as a fresh start"
berkeley,fp509qb,t3_gb8bmn,1588312277.0,"1. natural recreation + strong outdoor scene
2. integration with city and opportunities in bay area
3. diverse opportunities! hang gliding coop, you can apprentice at gourmet restaurants nearby, visit world class museums, intern @ xyz. and we have so many clubs lol
4. Berkeley student cooperative. best residential life
5. world class education. undergrad learning can be hit/miss but there are so many world renowned professors, opportunities to listen to visiting scholars and engage with the graduate community. made so many friends from all over the world here :)

it's not perfect but those are the biggest perks for me"
berkeley,fp4oyl0,t1_fp403zc,1588303888.0,"they block the most sound for me and hurt the least!
they are also cheap!

the other kinds i've tried
silicon putty like ones blocked a decent amount of sound but felt stuffy
other foam ones but in different shape: doesn't fit in my eat as well?
silicon spiral ones were uncomfortable?"

I also use a noise cancelling headphones which I recognize is only a bandaid fix of the situation.

it's difficult to gauge what the correct next step is. everyone is quite stressed in these times..."
