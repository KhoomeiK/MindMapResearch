technews,fpmdilq,t1_fpjv8sn,1588730710.0,"That's a difficult distinction to make because there are just so many cases where one side feels the other is being intolerant.   


Should someone on Twitter be able to say that they don't like a certain ethnic group? Should a preacher be able to go to college campuses and say that they think gay people shouldn't be allowed to marry? Maybe you could make the argument that these beliefs only cause harm and should be disallowed. Would you disagree with a preacher going to a public park and saying they don't support furries? That's intolerant, but I imagine a much smaller portion of society would take issue with that over racial/gender/sexuality based intolerance. It's hard to draw these distinctions of what is/isn't intolerance without creating precedents that would stop every form of expression that could be construed as intolerance."
MadeMeSmile,fpmd38v,t1_fpjrins,1588730453.0,I think the truest lesson I've learned about coffee is that you need to find what works for you! I'm glad you've found a method that's easy and tasty to your palate.
MadeMeSmile,fpmcyar,t1_fpjq8or,1588730369.0,"I think the expectation for pre-ground coffee is that it will generally be used in a percolator (one of those things that you pour the water in the back and it auto brews 2-8 cups of coffee). A percolator is most similar to pour-over so it also needs a finer grind, or else it will be under extracted. You can use that pre-ground coffee if it's all you have on hand, but if you do decide to find/grind your coffee to a coarse consistency, you will taste the difference imo. That said, coffee is one of my hobbies and I drink/make a lot of different varieties just to explore that. You don't need to go down the rabbit hole if you just have your cuppa for the morning to wake up. :\^)"
MadeMeSmile,fpjpv4x,t1_fpje3ta,1588677363.0,"In coffee making, you're often balancing extraction and steep time. So far as I understand, by using a coarser grind, you can have hot water in contact with the beans for longer without over extracting. Over extracted coffee has a almost sour bitterness to it. You've probably had a cup before that tasted a big too beany and bitter. Note, coffee that's a dark roast will taste more 'burnt' but that's different. A pour over or an espresso will have fine and very fine grinds respectively because they're in contact with the hot water for shorter time. If you used a coarse grind you wouldn't get enough extraction in those brews. Plus there are other factors like getting the proper tamp for espresso. It's also as the other commentor mentioned with the metal filter not being as fine a filter as paper."
MadeMeSmile,fpj32mh,t1_fpim8xq,1588655220.0,"This is great introductory advice! If you do this you won't go wrong /u/whatevskiesyo. That said, to add a little bit more depth in case you're interested, here's how I prep my french press (that's what this variety of coffee is called):

Heat water to a low boil. The right temperature is right around the point where the bubbles are the size of a fish eye (this is around 200 degrees). If you have a temperature control electric kettle, that's even better.

I typically use about 30 g of ground beans to 350 g of water.

Grind your coffee coarsely as mentioned above. Visually, it can be hard to tell what is coarse or not. [Here's a comparison image.](https://coffeedorks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/coarse-ground-coffee.jpg) If you have a spinning blade grinder, it might not be possible to effectively get this coarse of a grind. Either, grind it at the store (e.g. Trader Joe's has coffee grinders, as do many supermarkets)  or don't worry too much about it (it will impact the flavor of your coffee though). 

Put your grounds in the french press, at the bottom, without the plunger inside. Pour in 50-100g of water and stir for 30 seconds with a plastic spoon. This is called blooming, it releases a bit of the CO2 in the beans. I don't totally understand the science but it makes your cup of coffee taste better. After 30 seconds, pour in the rest of the water and stick the top on with the plunger pushed down to the surface of the water. Wait 4 minutes, then slowly press the plunger through the coffee, taking about a minute to a minute and a half to fully press it through. This helps keep the sediment at the bottom of the water. 

Carefully pour the coffee from the press, taking care not to shake it too much. This way you'll minimize the amount of grounds in your cup. 

Congratulations! You've just made a good cup of coffee! :)"

It just feels antithetical to the idea of American exceptionalism to say ""well this thing has resounding success elsewhere but it would be hard here so let's not even try to move the needle.""

berkeley,fp040lt,t1_foxbdtd,1588202067.0,"I think that there's also a notable point that, as many of us will be privileged to good healthcare via our field of employment, we presume that that private healthcare *must* be better than a socialized healthcare system. It's not true! Regardless of if you're a liberal, conservative, etc, etc, socialized medicine means you will **pay less for better healthcare outcomes** in aggregate (and probably individually). Your taxes go up, your copay/deductible disappear (probably would cost you more than taxes), and you can now bargain for *different benefits* from your job in lieu of healthcare. [Our state would pay less for single payer than we'd save if we were to implement it.](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003013)  


If you can see the logic of single payer, please consider calling your state senator and assembly member [(you can find both here)](http://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov/). A simple script to give your support would be:  
""Hi my name is <name> and I'm your constituent in District <district number>. I'm calling to express my support for a statewide single-payer healthcare system.

todayilearned,fosfaah,t1_fos3gfu,1588029574.0,"Well, not quite. Can you figure out why private colleges don't want to use socioeconomic status as a determinant and would rather instead use race? The incentives are not aligned because colleges want more donations and money coming in. If they use socioeconomics, they risk cutting out would-be rich donors and potentially current rich donors. Colleges end up like any other private entity if you don't regulate them, so why wouldn't they maximize profits?"
todayilearned,forv2y7,t1_forpqkg,1588019027.0,"Every Ivy's incoming class is essentially a random choice among the top x% of applicants that apply. There's quote about how you could change one freshman class out for a totally different one from the same applicant pool and the quality wouldn't change. Considering that, and the economics/clout of picking who goes to Harvard (and then becomes a donating alum), using affirmative action makes sense. Affirmative action only makes sense if there's an incentive to have a diverse set of students and, at least currently, there is incentive to diversify. At the very least, colleges know that companies are looking for more diverse work-forces, e.g. many companies will have programs specifically to find woman/minorities, meaning these people have better shots at getting jobs than your 'typical' college student. Pair that with the added clout of being 'a college at the forefront of diversity', which, like it or not, is a pretty major thing right now, I don't see any reason a college wouldn't pursue diversity, at the expense of 'fairness' (in quotes, because it's a nebulous idea in the first place).   


People argue whether affirmative action is fair all the time. My take is that, in aggregate, someone from a white/asian background is more likely to have the resources to succeed and prepare for college applications than someone from a different background and males are traditionally more conditioned to go into tech/STEM than women (though this is certainly changing, which I think is a good thing). Considering that, isn't it sensible to contextualize the academic accomplishments of each student based on factors related to their background? I think so. Is it fair to do so based on race? That's a trickier question and my thoughts are that it's better than nothing. Ideally, in my mind, it would be a socioeconomic qualifier e.g. someone who's family who's made 20k/yr for the last decade (maybe working a job as well) getting a 2100 is more impressive than a kid who's family has made 200k/yr for the last decade getting a 2400. Sure, one scored objectively better, but the SAT is something you can game with private tutoring (that's usually very expensive). If you think about people's applications as a representation of not where they are in absolute terms but the delta from before high school to the time of application it makes sense. The kid who's from a worse off background who's improved himself 10x in high school is probably going to do more interesting stuff than the kid from a good one who's objectively doing better but has always done well (or, at least, that's the judging metric of the college).  


tl;dr: it should be based in economics; that said, it's better than nothing that it's based on race"

China,fogsb9n,t3_g7d5i4,1587756414.0,"Hi! Your story resonates with me in big part because I've experienced something similar in my (American) family. My mom is a somewhat hippie liberal, my dad is a moderate conservative, and my oldest brother is pretty far right, while I'm a leftist. I'm sure you can imagine that that leads to disagreement. I really am passionate about politics, I talk about it a lot and I don't really pull punches when it comes to what I believe, especially because I feel like I can talk to family in a way I can't talk to others. That said, I don't think I've convinced any member of my family of anything political. In fact, in the time I've known all of my family members, I've only seen them get more steadfast in their beliefs. Still, we talk about politics and issues we disagree. If you never spoke to anyone you disagreed with, you'd not talk to a single soul.

It sounds as though your mom isn't particularly unhappy and that there's no other major problems with your relationship. I'm not sure there's anything you can do to convince your mother that China isn't the best country in the world. I'm not sure it's worth trying even if there was an option. The most you can do is talk to her candidly about what you believe. If you don't think that you can, why is that? I understand that there's deferential relationships at play, but I would guess that that's not the reason you can't talk politics. Consider it good practice at improving yourself. At the very least, you will better understand what you believe and be able to vocalize it clearly and coherently.

My point is that saying that, because 100% didn't go to Clinton, Trump won, is a disingenuous argument implying the reason Clinton lost was in some way tied to this fact specifically, over much better explanations.

I doubt that 100% of any primary candidate's base ever goes to whoever is the eventual nominee (even if the nominee is the same person). I would guess that not even 100% of Clinton primary voters voted Clinton in the general, for whatever reason.  Considering all this, more Bernie voters went to Clinton in the general than we'd expect on past elections, i.e., statistically, it seems that Clinton was lucky to get as many Bernie voters as she did (or she would've lost by more).

Making 2016 retroactively about Bernie spoiling it, despite the work he put in to campaign for her and endorse her (which, again, counter to popular narrative that Bernie did too little too late, Clinton, iirc, also stayed in late in 2008 because to paraphrase her words,[she thought it was possible Obama might be assassinated, not shitting you, you can look up the quote where she describes a ""Kennedy"" situation](https://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0508/Hillary_cites_RFK_assasination_in_explaining_why_shes_still_in_race.html)) is only going to make Democrats hate leftists more and make them think that the reason they keep losing to those bad ol' Reps is because us leftists keep spoiling it.

The real reason is that the Democratic party would rather lose with bad centrists than win with leftists because otherwise the composition and hierarchy of the Democratic party would shift to the left and corporatist interests would lose out. If you need the proof, I honestly don't have anything directly tied to American politics (besides, I guess watching how the mainstream media treats left candidates vs centrist ones and the entire arch of the democratic primaries these last two cycles) but only a close analogue. Look at the Labor party in the UK and how the right-wing elements of this party sought to undermine Jeremy Corbyn. A leftist winning is always bad news for centrists. But centrists have never effectively stopped fascists which means the root cause of Trump won't go away, even if we ever do elect a Clinton or Biden type again."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fnnj66k,t1_fnnhsmm,1587093602.0,"It's a myth that protest voters were a particularly significant influence compared to other years. More Bernie voters went for Clinton in 2016 than Clinton voters for Obama in 2008, iirc. Clinton was doomed from the beginning because she'd been a figure of constant disdain from everyone right of center since the 1990s when she and Bill tried to change the role of FLOTUS by taking direct dealings with Congress and single handedly trying to shift healthcare policy. Pair that with her husband's neoliberal free trade deal, it's a wonder the formerly industrial rustbelt didn't swing more widely Trump. Say what you will about the intent (I can agree healthcare was fucked up), but Hillary Clinton was reviled and Bernie voters bit the bullet en masse to vote for her. You can blame Comey, you can blame sexism, you can blame Clinton failing to properly campaign, you can even blame what she and her husband did in the 1990s. You can't blame Bernie or his voters in good faith without acknowledging that other factors probably held far more tangible weight."

We'll see a similar candidate on the right every 4 years for the rest of our life if the Democratic party doesn't take a populist, socialist stance. Centrists have never stopped fascists."

politics,fnc7d5q,t1_fnbwsue,1586830193.0,"At the end of the day, if the best argument for Biden is the SCOTUS nominations, even if I end up accepting that (I personally don't really accept it), it's not going to inspire people to vote for Biden en-masse from the left wing. I'm not convinced it is as seminal an issue as liberals make it out to be (what did FDR do when the SCOTUS tried to block his progressive New Deal era legislation? he threatened to pack it and they got in line). I'm not convinced that working people will see it as meaningful or as a reason to turn out. If your argument is one of these people is less bad even though your life won't get meaningfully better, a simple cost benefit analysis tells you people won't put in any effort to vote Biden because there is no tangible benefit to their lives. I'm happy to continue this conversation via DM if you'd like."
politics,fnbr0be,t1_fnbjoa6,1586820605.0,"Biden enabled an absolute witch-hunt of a panel against Anita Hill by allowing ANY line of questioning as valid against her. If you think that his vote meaningfully changes the fact that he tried his damndest to get her allegations swept under the rug, we're in fundamental disagreement. On the noms, both of those nominations were in Obama's first administration, so yes, his second administration failed to get even a centrist. Whatever, the point is semantic. It's representative of a larger distrust in Biden and the Democratic establishment that must be acknowledged if your coalition wants any possibility of courting voters like me.  


You can shame me, tell me I don't believe in Democratic Socialism, but I promise you this will not inspire me (or many others) to vote for Joe Biden. No, I don't prefer Trump, that implies I've decided to vote for or support one or the other. I haven't, I plan to support neither, because neither espouses views that I agree with. You can try and logic this out and tell me I'm shitty. I don't care. I've told you what's required for me to vote for him (broad, progressive concessions). I don't care that you have a laundry list of irks with the current president. Trump is corrupt, sure. But he's just a mask off version of the corporate politics that Biden and institutional politicians are beholden to. Again, please tell me I'm shitty and my world view is wrong. At the end of the day, it won't matter because if that's the only dialogue that you and your coalition will have the left, then the left won't turn out for your candidate. Doesn't matter how much you will hate us for it, how much you will say we don't care about certain groups, how bad of allies we are, etc, etc. Look at what just about every major college group for Bernie has said about endorsing Biden (spoiler: they have refused to). Telling us to shut up and get in line won't work. If that's your only attempt, you've already lost."
