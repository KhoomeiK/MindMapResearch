I know some people interested in neuroengineering and AI research who are in the EE or CE major because it teaches the more applicable computer skills used to investigate this field. 

I’m not sure how difficult it would be to change, or whether you’d want to change. I’d point out that the information you learn on the neuro side for these kinds of projects is usually specific to the project itself, so you usually just need a strong basis in biology and basic brain sciences to contribute, not the thorough understanding you’d get from the biopsych major."
