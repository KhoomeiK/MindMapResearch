berkeley,fogfxn2,t3_g749mo,1587752074.0,The units have more private bathrooms on the ground floor of each hall building. They're also cleaned often!
berkeley,fo9sx2k,t1_fo9o6ip,1587630023.0,All the waitlisted folks are usually able to join the class a few weeks into the semester (it takes a while because CalCentral holds reserved seats longer than needed)
berkeley,fo9n10k,t3_g6hn0k,1587624415.0,"I can't speak on the MCB courses, but PH142 requires diligence due to the sheer number of hw and lab assignments. I can share the syllabus if you'd like."

berkeley,fo9mb34,t3_g6gvpa,1587623767.0,"It really depends on how you utilize your time and the difficulty of your classes. I used to force myself to ""study"" for so much of freshman year (very lame), so I didn't learn how to be efficient until sophomore year :/. Don't force yourself to study if you feel mentally exhausted, and use active learning methods instead of staring at a lecture slide!"
berkeley,fo5wzno,t3_g5rpwn,1587538457.0,I only took 13 units my first semester and I don't regret it. You don't want to be drowning in coursework your first semester--this is the time to adjust both academically and socially. Make some good memories to look back on heading into your second semester!
berkeley,fnz7t0k,t1_fnz00f6,1587388239.0,Yes you sort of missed the joke
berkeley,fnwtxj5,t3_g4chtw,1587325378.0,Nature is healing ❤️
berkeley,fnnt3ha,t3_g2tn4x,1587100910.0,"Since UMD has research opportunities available to you  + at a lower price, I would highly suggest choosing there! UCB has great opportunities, but there are also more people gunning for the same positions. You also mentioned that you wouldn't have time to pursue extracurriculars, so these opportunities wouldn't be highly available for you anyways.

Also, it's worth noting that a lot of the pre-med weeder classes are similar at every institution (which makes sense because these are literally the same subjects). For ex, the textbook UCB uses for its introductory Biology is the same one used at my local community college and likely other universities."

politics,fmsxfbz,t1_fmsx50u,1586363504.0,"I didn't say I wouldn't vote in the presidential election (I certainly will), but I'm tired of being taken for granted by the Democratic party"

berkeley,fjtdsrh,t3_fez648,1583606808.0,"The virus *likely* came from bats, who transmitted it to wildlife that are sold in wet markets (this is believed to be the case for SARS). Worrying about North American birds is completely unfounded."
