ucla,fpij60i,t1_fpihiui,1588642000.0,So you have absolutely no issue with how the DB talked about both candidates' lack of experience?
ucla,fpifhmx,t3_gdj169,1588639835.0,Obviously a transfer rep isn't going to have experience? It's just not possible?
ucla,fpifdvw,t1_fpie9wv,1588639774.0,There's 2 full comments talking about her other experience that was left out of DB
AmItheAsshole,fnp2p1q,t3_g2usa0,1587138179.0,"YTA. I would be more understanding if it wasn't clothes she bought. So at a bare minimum you stole from your own daughter and absolutely need to give her the money back. But anyways as someone who has strange phobias THEY'RE ON YOU TO HANDLE, NOT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO TIP TOE AROUND. Jesus my 17 yr old cousin with a phobia of dogs has more emotional maturity than you. (if ofc, this is even real)"
AmItheAsshole,fkbzjqv,t3_fh557k,1584042884.0,"NTA, also if I was the gf I would absolutely want to know about something like this because treating roommates like this (especially the lying) would be a massive red flag early in the relationship)"
