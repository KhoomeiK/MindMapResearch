MtvChallenge,fpk124p,t3_gdv33j,1588685807.0,She should come back based solely on the confessional of her and Bear (after he quit mid-challenge) where she rolled her eyes so hard that I was surprised they didn't break. That was gold
survivor,fpijurf,t3_gdiq2p,1588642409.0,"Matsing was just the gift that kept on giving. It's  a shame that they almost all got voted out early because they made for such great TV. Between Zane thinking he was a true genius, Russell's hilarious confessions (this, calling out Malcolm's showmance, etc.), Cookies, Roxy with her attitude and praying in tongues (a great combination), and the unlikely duo of Denise and Malcolm, I could've watched a whole season of just Matsing."

survivor,foyfms7,t3_gaae3j,1588171653.0,"yes and no for me. I definitely feel like the name itself determined a lot of their mindset (the Davids in particular talked so much about how and why they're Davids), but physically the Goliaths were so much stronger than the Davids (John, Alec, Dan, etc., and other than Natalie they had a lot of really strong girls), so I would've felt like an underdog even if the season wasn't called DvG"

survivor,foydekh,t3_ga0g2e,1588170474.0,"Duos are tricky. You have to make it far enough in the game to not get voted out solely for being in a too powerful of a duo. (As in, why Denise/Malcolm Nick/everyone kept their duo alliances secret). It did bite someone some people in the butt though when they turned on their duo in the end (like Ken/David- granted, if David had turned on Ken that would've been a different story)"
Bumble,foy92k7,t1_foxiu17,1588168013.0,I know it wasn’t a relationship or anything close to a relationship. He was the one who would send me good morning texts everyday and started the majority of our conversations. No need for you to be so hostile. There was nothing wrong with writing an “essay” length message talking about moving (which we had been talking about for weeks).

Bumble,fos6l34,t3_g9aa3y,1588024895.0,"I think it depends on what you're looking for. I'm looking for a relationship, so for me it would be a no, but I feel like if I was looking for something casual then it wouldn't be a problem"
Bumble,fos0p0c,t1_fos0aon,1588021847.0,"ahhhhh yeah, that changes a lot. I would say either quarantine fatigue or lost interest/someone else then."
Bumble,forufk8,t1_forthcr,1588018700.0,"hmmm that's tough then. I would maybe think that it's just quarantine fatigue. Or he could be trying slow things down since meeting in person is kinda out of the picture for a while rn. Or he could've just lost interest/found someone else (I felt this way when it happened to me, but I'm definitely hard on myself and jump to worst case scenario in these things. It sucks for us, but that's always a possibilities in these kinds of things). Unless you two are perfect matches and have the same exact interests/hobbies, it's really really hard to maintain something rn, so he could be trying to stretch things out too. Granted, I've noticed that I'm starting to becoming increasingly less motivated to do anything during this quarantine and it's hard to feel really excited about anything, so you might just be an unfortunate and accidental victim of that happening to him. I wouldn't keep asking him every week, but if this keeps going on, I would bring it up again. (Usually I would say that seeing how long it takes for him to text you first is a good indicator of interest, but these are some really stressful times for all of us)."
Bumble,forszi5,t3_g97jbt,1588017980.0,"Had the same exact thing happen to me (we'd been talking all day every day for a month until he started pulling away) and then 4 or 5 days later he told me that we should stop talking (He had a lot of things going on related to the pandemic, so at first I thought he was distant because of that. Plus he's in the medical field, so that alone is stressful enough rn. In the end, it was because he's moving a little farther away soon due to work, which is true, but who knows if there were other reasons). I really wish I would've just told him how I felt he was distant and asked him if he was ok/what was going on and then we could've talked it out instead of him becoming distant and then getting hit with an essay length ""you're amazing, but we should stop talking"" message. It could very easily be the pandemic, but it doesn't hurt to ask. Even if it's just stress, it's still nice to check in and make sure he's ok."
survivor,forr962,t1_fornnmz,1588017112.0,"Yeah, unless he really was like Cochran and came back for a second season with a different game plan, I question if Christian could ever actually win too. He was too nice and didn't seem to scheme as much as the other people on his season (unless that was lost in the edit).

I usually give people a bit of a grace period with their emotions in the beginning. I feel like we all think we would be totally fine and rational, but I guess you never really know until you get out there. She definitely would've been voted out for being too emotional in the first fews days though without Christian there. I think more so than her emotions though, she would need more charisma or ability to make friends across alliances. Especially at the tribe swap, she did befriend Allison, but she really relied on Christian to save her there (which goes back to your point about questioning whether she would have been able to do it on her own). 

I agree, at first I thought John was going to be really douchey, but he seemed really sweet! I even wish we could've just seen more of that in the edit. I do hope he comes back for another season, but his muscles alone do make him a big target come merge. 

The blurred line is definitely a problem. I think Davie's was actually quite fitting. He talked about being made fun of for being a nerd while growing up and throughout the season it was really nice to see him become such a good player physically and socially. Granted, he was a backup (they had someone drop out of the season at the last second and replaced them with Davie), so that could be part of the confusion about him not fitting perfectly. He did have experience with being outdoors a lot, so it felt like he was better at that than most of the Davids...
Alec was interesting. He originally gave me Malcolm vibes (cute guy, in good shape, bartender, says that he flirts with girls to get what he wants, etc.), but he didn't do as well as I thought he would. I still liked him though and I would guess that his looks, confidence, and physical shape were probably the main reasons he was Goliath. 

I'm skeptical too about it working another time, but we got such a good cast out of it that I would be willing for them to at least try it (and maybe bring back some of the original DvG players?). It would be really hard to do though"
Bumble,forp9ss,t1_forowti,1588016109.0,"idk a day seems a bit short for someone you just started talking to. If they had been talking for weeks I would totally agree, but they haven't. When I get really really busy with work, it sometimes takes me 2 or 3 days to respond to someone I don't have a really solid/long-standing connection with."
Bumble,fornv7v,t1_formkns,1588015409.0,"Yeah, I get that. It was just such a drastic change that I was taken aback (especially the selfies with really weird filters than make him look creepy). thanks"
Bumble,foretrq,t1_fore9n8,1588011021.0,"I totally get it. When I really like a guy and he starts pulling away I feel the same way (and have been guilty of double texting haha). It's just a tough time for all of us rn and being too aggressive isn't the answer. (It's also a tough time in general to be on apps, so none of us are really successful rn) 
Keep your head up, you'll be fine."
Bumble,fore0zp,t1_forc27e,1588010630.0,"It's a tough time to put time limits on people. I would honestly not say anything and just let her sit. Normally I would say give her a week at most, but you just never know what someone is going through rn. Messaging multiple times is definitely not the answer though. There's always other girls to match with. Don't stress out over one you haven't met or talked to for an extended period of time (as in weeks or something)."
Bumble,forbwo4,t3_g959be,1588009616.0,There's a possibility that they moved outside of your 8 mile radius (or at least the one person you saw). But I've also had Bumble say that I'm out of guys and then the next day there's somehow tons of possible guys for me to swipe through.
Bumble,forbe4n,t3_g93tx9,1588009368.0,"I (26f) definitely wouldn't send a reminder message or a follow up. As a girl using the app, it can be overwhelming with the number of matches, and during a time like this, I find it's harder for me to check my dating apps so often. Also, sometimes I'm stressed out and can't hold a conversation depending on work/grad school. Even the guys I really like, I've only been messaging once or twice a day lately. On days when I'm playing around on my phone more or have more mental energy, I'll text them often in a certain period of time. However, when a guy sends me reminder messages after a day or two, it's a huge turn off. We're all adults and have lives outside of apps. My career, friends, and family will come before a guy on an app rn especially during a pandemic with no real end in sight. (even outside of the pandemic, I still prioritize myself over a stranger I've never met.) Don't take it personally even if she does ghost you (it happens to all of us)."
survivor,foqoif1,t3_g8an23,1587997887.0,"I loved Christian! He was such a sweetheart and definitely reminded me a bit of Cochran when it came to talking too much and being a lovable nerd. But Christian was too nice and wasn't able to be as conniving as Caramoan Cochran (and Christian would've never been as sassy or mean in confessionals).

Gabby was an interesting player especially in relation to Christian. On the one hand, she started off very emotional (I don't really blame her though), but she still made some very good moves in the game. (One being figuring out very early that Bi and Jessica wouldn't work with her and being able to use her relationship with Christian in order to sway the votes to get rid of them.) I do think her timing was off regarding getting rid of Christian, but I can respect that she realized she needed to turn on him and she didn't just try and ride his coattails to the end.

I definitely agree that John and Dan did much better socially than I expected, but I wonder if that's because I liked the unexpected brochacho alliance. John was very good with trying to reason with the unreasonable Natalie (can't knock him for not succeeding haha). Dan's alliances were smart with the guys, but he definitely messed up when it came to his alliances with girls. Granted, I do give him credit for finding an idol and getting voted out in one of the biggest plot twists in Survivor history.  I would really enjoy seeing John and Dan on future seasons.

The theme is interesting especially regarding how they categorized some people (I don't think I would have put Mike as a goliath, no offense). I don't think it's the best theme in that regard, but the cast was so amazing on DvG imo that I would be totally fine with a DvG2."
relationship_advice,foolnkw,t3_g8lgby,1587941455.0,"1. I'm so sorry, but you are being raped. Him not stopping when you ask him to and you crying during sex is not normal and this is rape. Being affectionate afterwards doesn't change that. I really recommend talking to a therapist (alone) and leaving as soon as you can. There are so many people who can help you with finding help and resources for domestic violence victims.
2. It is not your job to have sex with a bf whenever he wants you to. That is not true AT ALL and sex is something that both parties must consent to (and therefore have to want to do). You should never feel pressured to have sex.
3. Even if he wasn't throwing you on the bed and pinning you and refusing to stop, a bf pressuring you into having sex when you're working on something important is not ok and is actually a form of abuse as well.
4. Him refusing to listen to your valid concerns and you being afraid to talk to him because he might become angry are very alarming. I really hope that you're able to get the help that you need."
survivor,fookhfv,t3_g8mx13,1587940766.0,"I love Christian, but he was too nice when it came to strategy.  However, Christian and Nick were both very good at moving between alliances and being able to adapt to the game. So I'd probably go with Nick honestly because he was able to survive a tribe swap on a tribe that kept losing and made it to the final 3 with 2 people who were on the original opposing side. (on top of all of the advantages/idols that Nick was able to get and use properly)"
MtvChallenge,foof8l9,t1_foko35o,1587937891.0,"I have a feeling that bananas is a little shorter or CT is a little taller than their ""official"" heights.

dating_advice,foo89k8,t3_g8l77f,1587934431.0,"Hey, I completely relate. I'm a little bit older than you (26F) and feel really insecure about my lack of sexual experience and experience with relationships. I haven't had a relationship in 11 years and I decided that I finally was at a place where I was ready to date and put myself out there. I downloaded my first dating app March 10 haha and clearly that hasn't really turned into anything. Don't put pressure on yourself to just lose your virginity. I slept with an acquaintance from high school just so I could have a body count, and I felt terrible afterwards and he made me feel really shitty. It's frustrating, but I know waiting until all of this is over will be worth it. I've been talking to guys on apps, but honestly I'm having more fun talking to friends rn and doing things that I want to do. The right person won't care about your lack in experience (that's what I've experienced with the people that I've dated), and anyone who makes you feel bad about it isn't worth it."
Bumble,fonwhts,t1_fonvvn3,1587927843.0,"Yeah, I wouldn't get too worked up over it. You made the right call not going on a date when he was pushing for it (for your safety and his) and who knows what's happened for him in that time frame. It just sucks that he didn't communicate that to you along the way and kind of blindsided you. You sound awesome though, so you'll have no problem finding someone else who's interested in you."
Bumble,fonpp72,t1_fonnhl6,1587924050.0,"Honestly, his loss. You didn't do anything wrong, but it always sucks when you feel like you wasted your time. How do you know he blocked?"
Bumble,fohe2ek,t3_g704dr,1587764396.0,"I think it depends. 3 days seems a bit too short for me personally, but I think it depends on what point you are in talking to someone For me, I've been getting really busy lately and I usually can't answer texts Monday-Wednesday because of work and grad school. If I'm kinda meh about a guy (we just started talking, he's not putting much effort in, etc.), there's no way I'm replying during that time because I'm prioritizing myself. However, if there's a guy that I'm talking to multiple times everyday, 3 days without hearing from him tells me that he's maybe not interested (unless he brings up how busy he is when he replies). Granted, during times like this, you just never know...."
Bumble,fo3mcs0,t3_g5i59a,1587489311.0,"Unless she's a crazy toxic ex who has been stalking you, intervening in your life, and will key your car out of jealousy, don't worry about it. (If she is, maybe online dating isn't for you rn....) Yes, she's probably seen it and you will probably see her profile again."
Bumble,fo3h4h0,t1_fo3drjw,1587486809.0,"Hmmm in terms of the last picture, I would say it might be fine if you had more clear pictures of yourself and your face. On the one hand, you probably want to get someone who gets your references, but when you really only have one picture with a clear shot of your face, a picture with a mask on doesn't help. If you had more clear pictures, one with a mask on would be fine. (And it's not a douchey shirtless shot, so I don't think it's really hurting you. I would probably think it was funny if I scrolled all the way down and saw it, and it wouldn't hurt your chances.)

I totally get the forgetting to take pics in the moment issue. I'm the same way and it was definitely a struggle to find good pics, but you've got this!"

survivor,fo3782m,t3_g53ma8,1587481841.0,"I agree with a lot of the points here: clean your room and maybe try to make the background look more interesting if you can, don't start with stills (instead you can cut to some of the stills briefly while you're talking), I would definitely lead more with your physical difficulties leading you to become such a good public speaker (and you're of course a really good speaker, but definitely practice more and get off your script), the background music is fine but a little loud, maybe talk a little bit about your hobbies and other interests to make you stand out, and I would definitely try to get you talking at different angles or different locations (since sitting for the whole video can be a little hard to watch). Good luck though! You seem really promising!"
survivor,fo2y1jg,t3_g58cun,1587476715.0,"I would say that Tony has the better edit, but I also question if that's just because Tony does so many weird/entertaining things that they have to put it in (ladder of death, hiding out all day for no info, etc.)"
Bumble,fo2tqht,t1_fo1jcgs,1587473861.0,"I would definitely get a different profile picture. One with better lighting and maybe showing more of your body (I don't  mean showing skin, but just not a selfie).  I also don't think that the picture of you doing a pushup in the water is doing anything to help. I would try to swap those two pictures out. Your bio also seems a bit too generic and the whole lift/laugh/love thing is unnecessary. Even if you're just looking for something casual, I would still talk a little bit about your interests/hobbies aside from the gym"
Bumble,fo2sxs8,t1_fo09nh7,1587473290.0,"I agree about the pictures thing. You're a cute guy, but your pictures for the most part aren't clear or don't really show your face. Even your first picture has a bit of a messy background which might be a turn off for some girls (regardless of whether you're actually messy or not). As someone who considers themselves to be a fairly nerdy girl, I think your content is fine, I would just change your pictures to have at least one that more clearly shows your face."
Bumble,fo0wzzj,t3_g51ug3,1587421355.0,My backtrack still works (just tried rn haha) so I'm not sure? Bumble has been glitching and crashing on me a lot lately so maybe give it a few days and try to reinstall it again?
Bumble,fo0vo88,t3_g4ylgq,1587420631.0,"As a girl, I'd definitely say Bumble. Initiating a conversation can be a bit intimidating, but it seems like guys put more information in their profile on Bumble and I can use two filters to block out guys who have different intentions/values than me. Granted, I don't really see a difference in the kinds of guys on the apps, but Bumble is easier to filter through."
UCI,fo0uynh,t3_g51dp2,1587420247.0,"Hey, don't beat yourself up too much. Open notes usually means it's going to be harder, and even studying a lot can still mean that you can crack under pressure. Especially during a pandemic, it's normal for grades to slip a little bit. It sounds like you're smart and this quarter is probably just getting to you, so I would take the p/np if possible and not get too down on yourself. Keep your head up and use this to prepare more for future exams!"
Bumble,fo0le7l,t3_g50d02,1587415227.0,"hmmm that's tough. On the one hand, you don't want to waste your time, but two weeks is maybe a little early to let him know you've done so much research (granted, any guy who thinks we don't Google them and confirm their identity is delusional. In this day and age we have a right to be safe and want more information). You definitely shouldn't blindly trust a stranger, but I would maybe hold off a little bit on the confrontation and ask him more questions about his work and school to try and see if there are any holes in the story? Maybe give it another week? Of course I wouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, but the Facetiming does sound promising?"
relationship_advice,fhbbdh3,t3_f1y4jw,1581438776.0,I don't think you miss her. I think you miss the routine of being in a relationship with her.  You should definitely talk to a therapist if even for the loss of your dog.
