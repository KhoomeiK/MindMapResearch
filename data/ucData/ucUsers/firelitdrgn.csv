Pets,fo0msxn,t3_g4xr4v,1587415942.0,"Hello, I also moved from California up to Seattle (from NorCal). We have one corgi. 

We had him in his crate and we brought along bully sticks, treats, poop bag, water bowl and bottles of water (placed in easy access spots). We also did our best to take him out for a long long walk before we made the drive. We did do the drive in one go (like we didn’t stop anywhere overnight) though. 

We stopped every few hours at a gas station or a rest stop to let him go potty and get water, stretch his legs, and walk/run around a little. When we moved it wasn’t particularly hot so depending on when you’re moving you’re going to want to stop more frequently for water and potty breaks. 

Google maps said it takes about 16 hours to drive from where we were to Seattle but I think it took about 20-22 hours if you factor in all the potty breaks and stopping for food (and small naps for us in between). 

Feel free to ask if you have questions about the drive or about Seattle in general."

Also you saying that psych is a worthless degree makes you just as bad as the Asian parents who forces their kids into STEM and to become a doctor/lawyer/engineer/financial guru because they think that’s where success and happiness lies (they are not mutually exclusive). If you don’t want to constantly hear crap about it from anyone in the family, then start with yourself and not give crap to other people and break the cycle."

Seattle,fl5zu78,t1_fl5mg6a,1584850155.0,Then fucking stay home and tell everyone you know to stay home or stay 6 feet away from people. If people followed the damn rules there wouldn’t be repeated posts about it.
