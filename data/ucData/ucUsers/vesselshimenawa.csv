UCI,fno03sv,t3_g2wo69,1587107291.0,Lol did you just tell people not to shove their beliefs down your throat then tell them they were wrong for not choosing your life path
UCI,fnipgy6,t3_g1yl1h,1586984054.0,"This is kinda petty and plays right into their hands by characterizing people against them as spiteful, this doesn’t help the toxic atmosphere around ASUCI right now."
UCI,fnip4pw,t1_fniolbm,1586983881.0,"Calling a budget under 3 million “multimillion” seems kinda misleading, but I guess if you want to take everything at face value without analysis that’s a reasonable conclusion. 


Many students don’t use all the resources on campus that they are funded, the only difference you seem to care about is the fact that it’s going to a space for women."
UCI,fnfjcgy,t1_fnffk8f,1586909174.0,"I agree and supported the referendum. Previous Senators spoke saying that they were planning on giving funding through the reserves, but are now complaining about the hub not giving equality to men for opposition. I probably phrased it poorly, but I’m poking fun at the “change” in thoughts over this."
UCI,fnfaybk,t1_fnesp9e,1586904653.0,"I thought Senators wanted to fund it, just not through an extra fee? That’s not very cash money of you"
UCI,fnat9ky,t1_fnae6y8,1586803430.0,Where are these posts
UCI,fmnam73,t1_fmn372x,1586221760.0,"No, I’m defending the students right to democracy. You’re setting an arbitrary number that you feel is alright to recall a senator. Since you decided that 10 people is too little to recall a senator, then why is 40 people enough to elect one? That number of 10 would be given based on the number of people who voted in the last election. If you feel that number is too low, where are your efforts to raise voter turnout? You also didn’t answer my question, how would you suggest students recall senators under the current constitution?"
UCI,fmn1bq5,t1_fmmrx8d,1586216139.0,"The solution to the 25% being too little is to get more people to vote. Senators aren’t entitled to power, it’s given to them by the students. The same students can recall them. It’s not on the current senators to decide whether the amount of recall votes is enough once they’ve satisfied the minimum. If the students are the respect the power given by elections, then the senators is to respect the means to remove that same power. Graduating also doesn’t have anything to do with whether there is potential for corruption in the constitution. Just because you don’t see it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. There’s also plenty of analysis in this article, it’s just centered around this one aspect of the constitution. In fact the entire article is centered around this aspect, because it’s a concerning aspect for many students. The same students who were dissatisfied with the actions of the senate and voted to recall them. Abiding by the current constitution, students have done everything they’ve been asked to respond to this dissatisfaction. Stop pushing back the goalposts, we’ve done everything we can to say we don’t want senators in power. What else would you suggest students do to recall senators under the current constitution?"
UCI,fmm18b6,t1_fmlyxg4,1586196907.0,"If you don’t want 8 votes to remove a senator, where are the efforts to improve voter turnout? Why do you get to decide that 8 isn’t enough, while sitting doing nothing to improve that number? If 8 votes is too little to recall a senator, why is 32 votes enough to give someone power? Why do senators get to decide how many votes are enough for a recall election? You seem to be involved in the senate, can you speak as to why the recall elections have not been approved by the senate? Why is it stuck in Rules Committee"
