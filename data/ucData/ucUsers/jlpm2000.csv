AskReddit,fp4aer4,t1_fp3fq7e,1588294903.0,I dont think this was an accident.
running,fotb3xv,t1_fosgvkc,1588048988.0,"Yea you're right, I should wait longer between PRs. I've been running for a couple of months now, but just recently started taking it serious so thats probably why I've seen improvement a lot faster.  I've seen that its all about upping your mileage and the pace will naturally get better, so I will try and do that for now."
running,forw0yo,t1_forn3yo,1588019496.0,Ive never ran an actual race so Ive never had anything to train for.  I should probably just set a date maybe two months in the future and train for that.  I definitely dont want to injure myself because I remember what it was like to have shinsplints a while back and how disappointing it was not being able to run.
running,forvmsw,t1_forl6qk,1588019301.0,Yea Ive never ran an actual race and I dont know when I will with covid19 around but I usually time my runs either way.
bowhunting,foo6fn4,t3_g8ddk5,1587933415.0,"This is so helpful. Im like you and was going to ask this same question sooner or later, now I dont have to."
running,fo8dw5u,t3_g6ac9x,1587594694.0,"All I can say is run it, dont walk it.  You will feel a greater sense of accomplishment if you run it all as opposed to walking even a small portion of it.  Try as hard as you can but if you feel like its too much and might have to walk then slow down and jog, just dont walk."

Ghosts,fncgyqa,t1_fnbnrmg,1586836505.0,I heard she built them like that because she designed it all herself without a blueprint and all of her workers had therefore no blueprint to follow so shit got messed up.  Don't know how true it is but it would make since for this to happen if there was no blueprint.
CAguns,fmrj4kd,t1_fmr6jr8,1586324774.0,Yea bear spray is probably best.
CAguns,fmrj0mw,t1_fmrfsd5,1586324678.0,Yea your not mistaken.  You can't have a single lead bullet on you while hunting.
CAguns,fmriso4,t1_fmrh6ku,1586324484.0,"CDFW definitely doesn't fuck around, I currently hunt with a rifle and have been stopped pretty much every season.  Sometimes they check ammo, sometimes they don't.  Definitely not worth the risk."
CAguns,fmrid94,t1_fmr5cl8,1586324112.0,"I definitely will give them a call later on to check with them, I was just wondering what people already knew because I didn't feel like calling right now and I was already on reddit.  I  also have been looking into bear spray and its probably best.  A bullet only hurts them unless its a good shot but the spray does mess with their strongest sense."
