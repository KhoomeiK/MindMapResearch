Are there any companies that actually will ship product for profit in a few years? This is not required for a successful tech company, and would be *extremely* surprising for a fusion company, so I'm just trying to suds out what you actually mean here, and maybe gain some information."
energy,fphyexh,t1_fpht9mx,1588630122.0,"I see where you at coming from, and thank you for bringing up that argument. It's a commonly held belief, and should be addressed. 

But I take a bit of issue with it, in the following way: the *actual* thing we care about is matching generation to the load in the grid. Constant, steady baseload power is not helpful for this, at all! The only thing that makes it helpful is if it's *cheaper* than dispatchable power sources. If coal and nuclear are more expensive than a more flexible source, then their baseload properties are actually a detriment, not a positive aspect for grid management. 

So ultimately there are two things that are helpful: dispatchability and cheapness. Being constant is not so great, but if it can be depended upon to be dispatched, that could be something worth paying for."

That you can even ask this question, without knowing far in advance that unsubsidized solar is profitable, and that the EROEI is gainful, says everything that I need to know--you are completely out of touch with the reality of 2020!  Time to catch up, especially if you are prognosticating 20 years into the future, but living 20 years in the past. 

Anticipating massive technological gains in one area (fusion), while not anticipating technological gains in a far more agile, iterable, and scalable technology like solar or storage, means that you have missed the boat. No need to read further, or address the rest of your comment!"
energy,fpha7ef,t1_fph53ex,1588617676.0,"Solar has clear and predictable ways to decrease cost, and is finally undercutting the alternatives as it's cost drops. There will be a floor, but we won't hit that floor for quite some time. 

Energy density has nothing to do with economics. Lithium's energy density is more than adequate for all purposes. Comparing lithium and deuterium this way doesn't even make physical sense. 

Pumped hydro, despite its super low energy density, is typically very economical. The limit is of course the geological features that allow it, and a reduced appetite for humans to massive change ecosystems to create more dams. 

Every time I have asked a fusion advocate for a reason to expect fusion to be economical, they have responded with this sort of dissembling.

Let's assume that the fusion heat source is 100% free, zero-cost. In 20 years, will steam turbines and cooling systems be more expensive or less expensive than solar + storage?  I'm guessing that solar+storage will be cheaper than steam turbines and cooling. I could be wrong.  But the idea that the capital cost of fusion reactor plus steam turbines plus cooling being cheaper than solar + storage?  That seems like an extremely far-fetched idea to me, and would require sabotage of both the solar and storage industries to keep them from developing technology at all."

LosAngeles,fo7sm7x,t1_fo7m696,1587583839.0,"That's simply untrue, Hong Kong has had four deaths, has massive density and public transit.

In NYC, the densest places have the lowest infection rates, and all the car-based counties outside of NYC, where only a tiny fraction of people even commute to NYC, have higher rates of cases. 

Sprawl didn't save anybody from this. You still go to big box stores, stand in lines, and get close to people when living in sprawl. Plus, you go lots more different areas.

Walkable, non-sprawl means similar levels of close contact with other people at stores, offices, etc. But maybe people are more aware of it and more careful. Also, I'm pretty anti-market urbanism, so I'm not sure what to make of this particular source, but there's some stuff from network analysis that may be applicable to these differences:

> ""There are two reasonable explanations for the likely fact that coronavirus spreads more along roads than rails. First, subway-dependent people may have cut their travel more than car-dependent people. Since travel brings us in contact with others at our destinations (stores, jobs, restaurants), the excess drop in travel may have made subway people safer precisely because the subway seems so dangerous.

> Second, and less obviously, subway-dependent people likely have more geographically-determined circles of contact. Car owners can move freely well beyond their immediate neighborhood. In the language of networks, non-car owners are more likely to approximate “neighbor flooding”; car owners to approximate “uniform gossip” (hat tip to Wesley Chow for this conceptual framework). That is, if a grocery store in a low-car-ownership neighborhood becomes an infectious spot, it is likely to infect a bunch of people who will all “reinfect” each other at the drug store and the park. In a car-oriented context, by contrast, infected grocery customers would drive off to different pharmacies and parks and infect other people.""

UCSC,fnimj4l,t1_fnhyqqr,1586982581.0,"Pretty much any single family home close to campus is around a million dollars. 

However, most of that is in land value, not the value of the structure. So there's a super super simple way to make that housing a ton cheaper: allow apartments to be build instead of only single family homes.

It's the city that bans apartments, or dorms, from being built in Santa Cruz. And because there's such an extreme shortage of buildable land, and such an extreme shortage of housing, if you only make tiny small changes to zoning to allow apartments, the value of that tiny upzpning will cause the value of the land to skyrocket. There's a huge bubble in land values because of high restriction on the amount of housing that's allowed, so unless you pop the bubble by hugely increasing the amount of buildable land, you get very little savings by upzoning small amounts of land. 

This method of downzoning everything to increase land values, then upzoning only tiny portions to maximize the profits for a few lucky landowners, has been used to disastrous effects in places like New York. So far in California, we mostly just do the broad downzoning part, and haven't done much for targeted upzoning, fortunately.

Popping the bubble of land valuation, equitably, is a tricky challenge.  Ultimately all our housing woes come from this highly manipulated ""market"" for housing where wealthy homeowners have full regulatory capture and are able to exploit those with less wealth and newcomers-- meaning anybody young or poor or from a background that's not wealthy, like most UCSC students."

bayarea,fndn6b6,t1_fnbe2xi,1586873677.0,"That's ridiculous, most UCSC students don't even vote here, and they are a tiny fraction of the county population, and widening 1 was a county level vote. Blaming UCSC for that is just another way that SC refuses to understand itself and the sources of its problems. 

And speaking of those problems... the effects of widening highways are very well understood, particularly when it comes to places that don't build enough housing. What happens is that as soon as the commutes improve, more people start to live further out where it's slightly cheaper, then in a small number of years we have the same congestion. More people are stuck in it, and more people can use the highway, but now we are stuck with far higher infrastructure costs, and people's lives are not much better, traffic is even worse (because everybody has to drive to their distantly located jobs, local traffic also increases by the same amount too!)

The only solution is to allow enough housing close to the jobs, so that people can drive less on their commute, which requires less road infrastructure to support each person. And even allow (some) people to live close enough to bike if they want, or if you're really living the dream, walk to work.  Which means finally allowing apartment buildings in the commercial corridors like mission st, Soquel, more housing downtown, and a ton more housing by the industrial parks on the far West side. 

And it also means supporting state legislation like SB 50, which would have forced Silicon Valley to house far more of its workers, and had almost no effect on Santa Cruz because we don't have frequent enough busses. But instead we elect city councilors that out of one side of their mouth complain about our housing problems, but refuse to do *anything* at all to improve housing. And in fact will fine any reason to block housing.  15% below-market rate units? Not enough!! 100% below-market rate units? We can't segregate poor people from others!  

When it comes to the horror show that is Santa Cruz politics, the problem is not from UCSC students or Silicon Valley, the problem is entirely our own refusal to take any responsibility. (Because it benefits the wealthy long-time residents that keep on raking in big bucks with no work due to scarcity.  They stoke the anti-UCSC and anti-valley sentiment because it helps them keep the current system in place.)"

Personally, I think we need a full land value tax, enough to end all sales tax, and possibly a vacancy tax on top of the land value tax for all the vacation homes. Unfortunately we will need to amend the constitution before something like that is legal. We have set up perverse incentives, meaning that towns that are run by landlords like SC and Capitola will do all they can to make the housing crisis worse.
