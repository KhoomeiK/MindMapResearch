Google Translation: 

\[Global Times-Global Network Reporter Bai Yunyi\] At the Foreign Ministry ’s press conference on April 9, some media asked about the recent discriminatory practices against Africans in the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic in Guangdong and other places. what opinions do the Chinese have on this issue? In this regard, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that he has taken note of relevant reports. The Chinese government treats all foreign personnel in China equally and opposes any differentiated practices targeted at specific groups of people, and has zero tolerance for discriminatory words and deeds.

&#x200B;

Zhao Lijian said that since the outbreak of the New Coronary Pneumonia epidemic, China and African countries have always supported each other and joined hands to fight the epidemic. Some time ago, at a critical time when the Chinese people were fighting the epidemic, African countries and people gave strong solidarity and support, and China remembered it. At present, China is also very concerned about the development of the African epidemic. China has actively taken action from the government to the private sector to provide assistance within its capacity to African brothers. Facing the severe test of the epidemic, China and African countries are more united than ever before, showing the brotherhood of suffering.

&#x200B;

""For the situation you mentioned, we have taken note of the relevant reports. I would like to emphasize that the Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally, opposes any differentiated practices targeted at specific groups of people, and has zero tolerance for discriminatory words and actions. Zhao Lijian said that at present, all countries in the world have adopted a series of control measures in response to the epidemic. The most urgent task facing China against the epidemic is to prevent overseas imports and domestic rebounds. This requires the common understanding, support and cooperation of Chinese citizens and foreign personnel in China. The Chinese side attaches great importance to some of the situations and misunderstandings that have occurred in the implementation of the measures, and will urge relevant parties to improve their working mechanisms and methods. At the same time, they also hope that all foreigners in China will strictly abide by the local epidemic prevention regulations and cooperate with and support China in the prevention and control work Through joint efforts to win the final victory against the epidemic."
