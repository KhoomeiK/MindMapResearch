>  lot easier to develop biology expertise with a strong computational / maths background than it is to do the reverse.

That's good to hear, as I am in a CS MS program and this is exactly what I'm hoping to do soon!"
slatestarcodex,fpm969e,t1_fpkqf5o,1588728119.0,Word!
slatestarcodex,fpm93vp,t1_fpllr26,1588728081.0,"Haha, LSD had that same effect on me."
slatestarcodex,fpm91gl,t3_gdyjck,1588728041.0,"I embarrassed myself in front of a few girls when I was in 5th grade. Nothing too bad, just said some retarded shit. But somehow that had a huge effect on me. It made me nervous about speaking to girls. Now I am in my early 20s and have had very little interaction with girls."
slatestarcodex,fpm8hwt,t1_fpkkg19,1588727725.0,"I assume you found biology and geology really interesting which is why you chose them. As a current CS major who doesn't find it toooo interesting, I would like to know more why you wish you did CS."
PurplePillDebate,fplaqrl,t1_fpkbe8n,1588709363.0,"Yeah but that's only according to your values. I think that double standards should change and that they should be the same morally, emotionally etc.

I think that visiting a prostitute reveals no more about a man than casual sex does about a woman, because the difference is only in the availability."
PurplePillDebate,fpl9r3r,t1_fpk90hd,1588708859.0,"My problem with this is that you are disqualifying the guy by his ability to get casual sex from other women. You're letting random women decide for you based on superficial criteria.

I don't think not being into the stupid casual sex game should be indicative of value.

At least you're not moralizing about it though."
PurplePillDebate,fpl8s13,t1_fpkiu1o,1588708376.0,I mean I did of course expect it to be the consensus of women outside of this sub in the real world. But not the women on this sub.
PurplePillDebate,fpk6gol,t3_gdt41n,1588688916.0,"I can't believe how many answers here immediately disqualify such men. How is it different from casual sex where often the man has to pay indirectly? Many men also have a greater physical urge for sex.

To me it reeks of hypocrisy and groupthink."

2meirl4meirl,fo4e49e,t3_g5dpwg,1587502777.0,"That's true. But there are also drugs. And love, friendship. And beautiful nature. And art/music/literature. And learning about the mysteries of the world.

Sadly most people don't get much of these things (myself included, so far). But if you do then life is a lot better. Maybe even worth living."

Guitar,fmy7tla,t3_fxsq28,1586479992.0,Honestly Fretjam is the best free online resource for beginners as well as intermediate. Steve Stine's YouTube channel is also really good.
