ucr,fowlcq9,t1_fowgxey,1588122048.0,"I'm really quite curious now as to how you'd define mansplaining and how it happens to apply in this particular situation.  Or sure, my bad, you just successfully trolled me, and I'm a bad person and should feel bad because of that.

At any rate, were a particular male employee I work with to tell me that their kid is ruining their internet connection by doing nothing other than playing fortnite, and were I to tell them that's likely impossible, and then give thoughts on what might else be going on, well, would that be me mansplaining as you put it?  Not that my thoughts are particularly well crafted or even great?  Or maybe?  I suppose I didn't even think about OP being on dailup.  And sure I might tounge in cheek throw in my Linux preference and whatnot.  But still, my serious thoughts and recommendations at the very least took a decent amount of effort on my part as tube things go.  And my efforts were far from disingenuous.

And yes.  I'm sorry.  I am a bit calloused to the suffering of US citizens sometimes.  I will remind you of places like Papau New Guinea, or even Indio.  To that I'd urge you to join the peace corps upon graduation.

But I do also get it.  Besides a new black plague, I'm sorry we're likely at the beginning of another great depression.  I really am.  But me trying to just be helpful in my round about way, and then getting shit on by you, well, I guess, do what you do.  Or fine job trolling me.  Or whatever.  Fuck it.  I'll go back to stardew valley."

ucr,fow1pqi,t3_g9uk7e,1588111396.0,"Playing a video game shouldn't take down the rest of your network.  Or I mean, sure, it could, but fortnite doesn't seem like a malicous thingy.  What sounds possible is that various machines on your network do have malicious things going on.  As in viruses and malware and whatnot.

But what seems even more likely is that your whole network isn't going down, you just have a bad wifi signal in whatever part of your dwelling you happen to be in.

If you need any help figuring that out then you are welcome to further hit me up for help and I'd be willing to oblige.  The first steps in such things of course are ditching Windows and installing Linux.  Ha, nah, I kid.  But really I don't, but still, I kid.  I realize people aren't going to ditch Windows.  So what to do?  Check wifi signals or just make sure you're phsically wired.  

Myself though, if I even remotely suspect malware I reinstall Windows on every machine that's suspect.  Again, I realize it's most likely not an option for most people.

So right, you're stuck with PCs that you might suspect malware on.  So now what?  Well, malware bytes is awesome.  Making sure Windows is up to date should be standard practice.  Making sure your web browser is at least not completely out of control should be a thing, so to that I say an ad blocker like ublock origin and a javascript blocker like noscript.

And not to take away from your struggles, ha, or who am I kidding, I'm totally going to do that right now.  Take a look at this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI\_zxZwC0UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI_zxZwC0UI)

Fell so bad now?  Ha, maybe.  Or maybe you're from north Indio.  In that case, well, sure, try not to die and shit.  But I'd still take North Indio any day over Papau New Guinea."
NoStupidQuestions,fovqbrf,t1_foum3gu,1588105692.0,Sounds about right to me.  Getting up and going to class should never be a thing if you're in school.
offmychest,fosp9mp,t3_g9122a,1588035239.0,"Ha, not that anyone will even read this probably, but none of these things ever happen in Lord of the Rings Online.  Or sure, maybe, But I sure as heck haven't ever seen it and I've been playing for years.  And there are female characters all over the place, voice chat and all.  I'm not sure why lotro is such a mature set of players, but it's how it is.  Ha, or well, there was this one guy Iathax who would spam world chat about how he was the one true king of middle earth.  But he was actually pretty funny.  Anyhow, that's my plug for lotro for what it's worth.

And shazbot I sure do miss playing Tribes.  But, you can never go home again Toto."

CampingandHiking,forle3w,t3_g8zk73,1588014191.0,"I'm seriously curious about this one.  But may end up sounding like a cunt perhaps.  But anyway, how do people get lost hiking?  I've gone on countless treks with absolutely no worry about where I was going or how I was going to get back and made it back fine without any chance of ever being lost.  I honestly don't get how it would ever happen.  Darkness?  I suppose, but it would have to turn to daylight at some point I would think.  Or is it just 30 day treks people are going on and those turn out bad?  I guess I could see that.  But still, I'm confused."

linux4noobs,fntt1ia,t3_g3vafa,1587248087.0,"Depends entirely on your goals.  Once upon a time I set about reading every man page.  Once upon a time I thought I could tackle the whole of the Linux kernel source code.  With all things computing learning about abstraction is a key element.  Or not all things I suppose if you're working on hardware, but still."
computers,fntry63,t1_fntr1xn,1587247541.0,"Ha, true story, my nutjob uncle was moving and decided it would be a good idea to turn the 120 volt switch on the back of his pc's power supply to 220.  Plugged the thing in and then fried the thing.  I laughed more than I shoulda because well, dude was sorta a jerk.

My tips though?  Supermicro boards put everything else to shame.  Double the amount of ram and disk space you budgeted for.  Nzxt make the best cases.  Rosewill make the best power supplies.  This is of course all my stupid stupid biases.  Still, I never found anything but supermicro boards in datacenters that mattered.  And smoke breaks confirmed that the people next door ran supermicro boards too.  Or dell sometimes and some nut jobs run windows even."
computers,fntqz2d,t3_g3qn4g,1587247056.0,"As always, given money to spend on a PC, I would go with a supermicro board.  If you're after something less hands on though, well, I'm not sure I can help you except to say that solid state drives, loads of ram, and loads of disk space help out so so much with virtual machines."

cookingforbeginners,fntpg4r,t3_g3sv7o,1587246267.0,"So searing meat is all about flavor.  That's it.  It doesn't lock in juices.  And it most especially doesn't lock anything in if you're doing a soup or stew.

Think about it like this.  You have a great steak.  You can do different things with it.  But my suggestion would be to grill it or cook the thing in a cast iron skillet or put it in the oven on full blast, broiler if you have one.   But then I could also cook it low and slow, or I could boil the thing, or I could microwave it, or I could sous vide the thing, or whatever.  So why would I grill it or fry it or whatever?  Why would I finish an oven roast or sous vide thingy on the grill?  The flavor you get.  So when you have stew meat, sure, it's not tender maybe.  But you still want the flavor that you get from semi cooking it like you would a regular steak or chicken thingy or what have you.  But you also want to tenderize the thing.  So you get the flavor out of searing the thing.  You get the tenderness by then throwing into a soup or stew or braising it or whatever."
cookingforbeginners,fntn3ob,t1_fnthtji,1587244979.0,I disagree.  You can dry out meat even in a soup if you cook it too long.  My take anyway.
gardening,fntlde7,t3_g3oudx,1587243982.0,"I mean, I like it.  But personally I'm not much for aesthetics.  My approach to gardening these days is to mulch everything.  Everywhere.  that grass and whatnot you have there?  Waste of ground.  Those bricks?  Waste of money, and possibly not good for your dwelling if it gets it all wet.  Hard to say from the pic but maybe you're covering up the weep screed? Ha, yeah, that's an actual thing despite the funny name.  The trellises too seem wrong to me, but I've never done them like that so what do I know?

Anyhow, were it my backyard I'd just start throwing mulch everywhere and then digging a hole in the places I wanted to plant stuff.  Then when the stuff I planted, sucessful or not, did its thing I'd turn that into mulch and rinse repeat.  Eventually you'll end up with some quality loom and plants will go nuts.  But for whatever reason though people like grass.  I myself do not get it."
ucr,fnthiet,t3_g3u1vg,1587241763.0,"Start doing drugs?  Ha, then you'll get loads of ""friends"".

I dunno, I mean, when I was at UCR I made friends by suiting up and showing up. I got a few different jobs at UCR.  I went to class.  Talked to randos about the homework or whatever.  Got assigned to projects with classmates.

Like the psychology 101 class that has 5000 students, you might not make any friends.  Or maybe if you sit in the same spot in the theatre every day.  But your upper division courses you should at least be making aquaintances I would think.  If not, well, try harder?  You don't win the lottery by never playing.  A stupid analogy I know, because playing the lottery is a bit retarded."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fntgbu6,t3_g3t0o6,1587241079.0,"So this is completely wrong.  you can't change the volume that some solid takes up just by dividing it into pieces.  Or I mean sure, if we're talking something that expands in liquid such as noodles or whatever.  Maybe?  I'm thinking yes, but that's purely intuitive.

As to whether or not you prefer items in a soup in smaller or bigger pieces, well, that's a matter of preference.  I do know my boss at one particular restaurant would get mad at me for not cutting up the soup items small enough.  So yeah, I get it.  Every spoonful should be having a bit of everything and it should all be bite sized.  Or not.  It depends on what you like.

As to whether or not you want more or less of a particular item in your soup is also a matter of preference.  I suppose at some point a soup turns more into a stew if it's over populated.  But I'm not going to skimp on a potato soup if potatoes are the star attraction.

Myself, I like a lot of broth and not much of other things when I'm doing soup.  So I'm with you on the being sparing about adding things.  But I mean, something being nutritionally dense isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It can be if you're getting morbidly obese or whatever.  But it doesn't have to be."
ucr,fntdjnq,t1_fnrytce,1587239501.0,"Just FYI, you can test out of a whole bunch of classes.  Just talk to your professors.  Perhaps typically geared towards grad students, it's still an option."

linuxquestions,fn8m4my,t3_g020p1,1586744806.0,"So like spend 50 bucks and get a raspberry pi.  Run Linux on that thing.  Then run Linux in a virtual machine.

Learn MIPS assembly.  Keep Learning.  Then learn Python Programming,  Then learn DNS.  Then set up Apache.  Then set up nginx.  Then set up Pyramid.  Then set up a whole bunch of other shit."
askscience,fmu7ksm,t1_fmtzrv3,1586386050.0,I don't know why you're saying what you're saying to be honest.  They're saying it could be as mutable as influenza and cyclical in the same way.
linux4noobs,fmizhsj,t1_fmh6u3d,1586120023.0,"Yeah, for sure.  What I get for being a jerk.  I read about 5 thingys up until just now.  Something like ""file"", ""command"", ""extension"", "".ima"", and ""dicom"".  And then I went about commenting.  But you're right, they seem to realize it aint Windows.

But so, back to me complaining.  Source code is an option.  Sure.  But it's a hard road for even the best of us.  And look, I think it's great to remind everyone that most Linux distros are completely open source.  But on a subreddit with newbie in the name, I'm still going to say that mentioning source code should be completely secondary to any advice you're going to give out."
