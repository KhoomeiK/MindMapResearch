betterCallSaul,fo1kj99,t3_g55a3g,1587435293.0,Isn’t that exactly how El Chapo escaped one time? He had a tub that popped open just like that. Or was that someone else?
betterCallSaul,fo1gvtm,t3_g55a3g,1587433018.0,The episode is called “something unforgivable.” Aka we’re getting commercials every 2 minutes because that’s something unforgivable.
betterCallSaul,fo1gt9b,t3_g55a3g,1587432974.0,Yep we have to be getting all the commercials at the beginning so the last 30 mins can be commercial free.
Dallas,fmw9lig,t1_fmw5caz,1586442405.0,Basically every church has moved to online worship. With <10 there also if live. He probably was implying that those 10 can still meet to do it live. We’re being careful and following orders to the T.
