Georgia,fp6pz6d,t1_fp6ia09,1588356581.0,"Depends which age group you're talking about. OP's age group has a very high mortality rate. People above 70 have a 10% mortality rate. That's a lot! The mortality of 50's is a bit lower, but still above 1%. 

And while the spread in general is still low, we know that this virus spreads very very well indoors. So opening up restaurants/facilities targeted at this age group is a disaster waiting to happen. Moreso that you can have you waiters not knowing that they are sick (asymptomatic spreaders)."
berkeley,fp4hv6k,t1_fp3y57r,1588299393.0,"Let’s hope so. Initial results that I’m reading about anecdotally seem promising.

So let’s hope to find something in the next year or two."
China_Flu,fp29vaa,t1_fp1p3jn,1588257975.0,"It is dangerous. A 1% mortality rate is super high, especially in a population that never saw that strain of virus. 10% if you’re over 70.

It has the capacity to shut down the healthcare system for months on end if spreads uncontrollable.

 Doesn’t sound like ‘not dangerous’ to me."

berkeley,fowwo5y,t1_fown9qn,1588128764.0,"Let’s hope so. I would 100% agree with you if we were sure that we find a vaccine. But we haven’t managed to do that for the more deadly SARS or MERS after decades, the coronaviruses family seems tricky.

If not, then steady spread is the only thing we could do and full lockdowns would not help us a lot.

We will also have to await the reinfection rates of people with antibodies in places like New York. Let’s hope that that number is very low."

careerguidance,fnnnw3t,t3_g2ods8,1587096908.0,"MD/PhD with a computational aspect. Of MD plus doing computational research on the side. Of just build/hack stuff on the side.

Tons of possibilities to combine, it’ll just be hard to be excellent at both."
neuroscience,fnnb4qh,t1_fnlv8bb,1587088387.0,"Absolutely bullshit.  The best time to start research as an MD student is after your first classes.

We need physician-scientists to bring scientific discoveries to patients. And you need to start training them early."
neuroscience,fnnatzs,t3_g2j3i9,1587088197.0,"Look into IFMSA. They do cool research exchanges  for med students all over the world every summer (except maybe this one?).

I’ve hosted a local group in the summer (Leuven, Belgium), best summer of my life!

Once you get your first experience it’ll get easier to get into other labs.

https://ifmsa.org/research-exchanges/

My advice is to start as early as possible. Went into med school with the same dream. Did research every year and it kinda got out of hand.. But loved the experience! PM me if you want to know more."
bayarea,fmxjoue,t1_fmxaai6,1586466258.0,"It's funny. If you quarantine well and early it looks like you overreact, and if you don't then it will look like you did way too little. 

If you look at early numbers the Bay Area was just a couple of days behind New York, but the shelter-at-home drastically reduced new infections. So I think the Bay definitely did the right thing!"

Coronavirus,fmhxfic,t1_fmh430d,1586096768.0,"Living in the US right now. Americans still think Trump is the disease. He’s a symptom guys, there is a lot wrong with your country, but trump is merely a symptom.

Look at the next presidential candidates.. they are elderly..."
