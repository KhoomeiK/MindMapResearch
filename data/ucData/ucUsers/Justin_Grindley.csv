UCSD,fpan84d,t1_fp5dlry,1588451651.0,"Did you confess to being the one that actually posted the questions or did Chegg staff rat you out? Either way, that some tough shit and I can’t imagine being in your situation. Granted, I somewhat am because I got caught Chegging a test, but I’m not the one who posted the questions so I got off much easier."

UCSD,fohqtfi,t3_g7hf1e,1587770865.0,"Anyone who calculates their potential final grade for a given set of assignment grades, determines a goal grade (typically a C- cuz fuck it), and puts the minimum effort into their actual assignments to barely get away with that goal grade. It’s all about optimization. That’s engineers by the way."
UCSD,fo0vw70,t1_fo0e9ws,1587420748.0,Mine have a 1-2-hour time limit even though I have no right to complain since they’re all already open book / open notes.
cursedcomments,fntq6lt,t1_fnqydvu,1587246649.0,Are you still talking about high school or now college? Cuz my high school didn’t have +/- 0.33 deviations in the GPA points for if you got +/- grades but my college does.

UCSD,fnma868,t3_g2b4e5,1587067799.0,"I’m straight up going to sit out the lab section of one of my classes and hope I still pass (C- is not only ok, but preferred since it fits one of many engineering student stereotypes) considering lab, as a whole, is worth only 20% of the grade and there’s a fuckton of easy extra credit opportunities."

UCSD,fmv85ca,t3_fxlelu,1586408679.0,"Try and appeal the suspension on the basis of a hardship it would impose on you. Maybe you have an off-campus lease that would be money flying away if you can’t even be in school for the quarter, you have classes to take this quarter that aren’t offered at other times of the year, etc. Actually, if you’re not taking classes like that rn, maybe review your class plan, consider summer sessions (most likely this year’s will be remote), and decide if a quarter suspension will even hold you back. If it won’t, it’s probably better to just accept the suspension, catch your breath for this spring, and try not to let it happen again."
UCSD,fmud6h7,t3_fxbibw,1586389086.0,No because my dad owns UCSD
UCSD,fmd8mb6,t1_fm8esys,1585961803.0,Dafaq for real? Is it just careers operating the facilities for now? I work(ed) at Foodworx which closed for the quarter anyways (and thus forever now) so I haven’t heard of that elsewhere.
