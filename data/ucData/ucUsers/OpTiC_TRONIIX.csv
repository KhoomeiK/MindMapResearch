ApplyingToCollege,fozu46w,t3_gaihua,1588196895.0,I don’t think it matters unless you’re a linguistics major or it’s explicitly stated as part of entrance requirements...
ucla,fosvk61,t1_fosigph,1588038937.0,"No screen sharing... and yes, it’s not that hard to copy/paste lol

I personally use my phone for Zoom and did the same during the exam; I placed it on my laptop directly facing me and it would have been really easy to check stuff online

Good luck with the exam"
ucla,fosg9bs,t1_forchc2,1588030116.0,"Well, I sat being watched on screen for 3 hours and did the exam - but what I learnt only a day before the exam was that I had 24 hrs to submit it (still, we were told that we had to remain on zoom until we submitted the exam before we could officially leave). However, my scanning app had issues and it took me a while to figure it out, and in that time the zoom call was ended; I emailed my TA and he said I should upload it before 24 hours is up. So, I got way more time to go over stuff and ended up submitting it way later...

As for how it went, we’d all be sitting in front of the screen (camera on, mic off) and the screens would shuffle from person to person. The prof and TAs also had a screen. If someone wanted to ask a question, you can do it privately, and if they wanted to leave for the washroom, they’d put it in the chat, switch off their camera and leave. It almost equivalent to an in-class exam for the most part...except that it’s online

Not sure if yours will be same format but yeah..."

yugioh,focn7pm,t3_g6tuul,1587673360.0,Holding arms and legs IBO; protection from battle and card effects and prevention of effects and attack seem way better than sending a card(s) to the graveyard just to have the opponent revive them again...

javahelp,fo1u5vv,t1_fo1tcj0,1587441578.0,"Nice one; For randomizing, I'm going to implement a Fisher-Yates shuffle and add some other stuff; right now though, I'm not sure why the MatchCardGame program isn't 'working'...

As I replied to the other commenter, when I run the program, it pops up ""which card to play?"" but after that, nothing happens...

Any idea what the issue is?"

ucla,fnvd2dr,t3_g43adz,1587288725.0,"I stayed in a plaza this year - well, 2/3rds of the year - and it’s pretty social... so I wouldn’t worry about that.

The classics are certainly more social in comparison but the downside is a lack of A/C! For me, that’s a big deal cause from experience and based on friends’ experiences, they’re really stuffy and the it’s not too big of a room...

In a nutshell, here are the pros/cons:

Plaza

Pros

1. Room size/space

2. A/C

3. Private/shared restrooms

4. If you’re in De Neve, you’re nearer to Bruinwalk, which means less walking up the hill...

Cons

1. More $$ for housing fees

2. Less social (but not antisocial)

Classic

Pros

1. Cheap

2. Pretty social; better for kids who party a lot

3. Nearby are most (decent) restaurants (Feast, Rendezvous, the Study) depending on where you are, making it less of a strain to grab food

Cons

1. Stuffy rooms

2. Less space

3. Communal restrooms (not sure if it’s a con but I guess it’s subjective to some extent)"
