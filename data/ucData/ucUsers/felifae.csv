bayarea,fpmjurj,t1_fpm2rh5,1588734667.0,From SLO originally. Miss it every day.
SLO,fp9u9dd,t3_gc4dl2,1588434678.0,Covid spike incoming...
SLO,fp3g166,t3_gb3d39,1588278665.0,Entitled people with the ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt happen to me‚Äù mentality.
SLO,fp2o4vx,t3_gaoug3,1588265070.0,"How will they regulate if 100s of people still show up with warning weather? I understand why and agree to an extent, but I feel it‚Äôll be hard to enforce."
SLO,fp0omnz,t3_g95bt0,1588213545.0,Really missing SLO right now!
cats,fovhgsb,t3_g9pvly,1588101385.0,Beautiful! My cat went through a similar transformation. The day we brought her home from the shelter she was so scruffy and scraggly. Now she‚Äôs filled out and a giant fluff ball! Her tail grew 3x as fluffy xD
California,forbao6,t3_g9463e,1588009323.0,Classic Central Coast. Miss living there.
California,forb8n1,t1_for9a59,1588009295.0,Yeah that aquarium is very sad. I know Central Coast Aquarium in Avila is raising funds to purchase / re-open it and make it much nicer.
California,fonofhr,t3_g8he4o,1587923354.0,One of the best field trips I had as a kid was to Hearst Castle! Lucky to be from SLO and so close to a cool place.
PeanutWhiskers,foneyag,t3_g8cg5n,1587918196.0,My cat will do this! Or she‚Äôll lick our nose / faces to wake us up. Lately she has decided that my boyfriend‚Äôs pillow is hers. It‚Äôs a battle every night.
SLO,foiiw2a,t3_g6ubwl,1587787753.0,"I'm surprised SLO hasn't issued the ""masks must be on in public places"" order."
UCSC,fo7xioq,t1_fo7s17u,1587586243.0,Amazing. I‚Äôm glad others have had similar experiences!
UCSC,fo7ajck,t1_fo74k49,1587575044.0,I also once saw someone plug a crock pot in at McHenry and they started cooking veggies in it! It was the spot to be for impromptu food prep I guess. I miss UCSC.
UCSC,fo6yi63,t3_g5vp04,1587569071.0,Seeing a woman casually talk to her friend in the McHeny women‚Äôs restroom while she washed a huge head of lettuce in the bathroom sink. After she took off her jacket and dried the lettuce with it.
California,fo0gf70,t1_fnwmxz7,1587412672.0,"I grew up on the central coast and had scrub jays in our backyard my entire life. They are so noisy and clever. They weren't afraid of my cat either!
We would get Stellar's Jays every once in awhile. Turns out they can mimic a hawk cry!"
food,fnxeyfw,t1_fnx868z,1587337244.0,I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs pretty easy!
food,fnx4z5x,t1_fnwp6iw,1587331576.0,It was really good! Tasted like pizza.
food,fnx4yh7,t1_fnwo5fl,1587331566.0,It was easy to make and a tasty bread treat!
California,fnwmgb7,t3_g4bthh,1587321193.0,One of my favorite birds. Too smart for their own good.
videos,fnmgs3r,t1_fnkpemj,1587071149.0,I saw them live a few years ago. I even got to go on stage! I sat on a Whoopie cushion. It was a good time.
sanfrancisco,fnj2fx6,t3_g1zbh3,1586990707.0,Nice gesture but still sketchy ü§î
television,fnabevy,t1_fna1426,1586794518.0,That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt watch the documentary. My heart breaks for those animals and I just can‚Äôt bring myself to watch. Joe Exotic is getting what he wants - publicity and popularity from all the jokes and memes being circulated about him.
westworld,fn90ayq,t3_g0algp,1586755300.0,Yes we‚Äôve noticed that too. The volume is poorly mixed. We have to turn on subtitles haha.
aww,fn71b3j,t1_fn700wv,1586711363.0,Even though a lady did call us and ask for us to Uber her a cat. She got mad when we said no.
aww,fn7186b,t1_fn700wv,1586711318.0,Yep it is good! Still coming in contact with the public isn‚Äôt the most ideal but we are making do. Lots of our animals have been adopted over the past few weeks which makes it worth it.
aww,fn6z9s3,t1_fn5r73k,1586710250.0,I work at a shelter. We are deemed essential and are still doing adoptions by appointment. So people are still coming in to adopt.
bayarea,fmywyj6,t1_fmyi65a,1586498357.0,It‚Äôs better to call the main line! You can DM me if you‚Äôd like.
EndangeredSpecies,fmwqydt,t3_fxur3e,1586451466.0,Was she on leash?
AnimalCrossing,fmt0bcp,t1_fmsacd2,1586364815.0,I still have only received 1 cherry blossom recipe and it was at the start of April. I‚Äôve been popping balloons to no avail.
AnimalCrossing,fmt05xr,t3_fx183n,1586364746.0,I‚Äôve only found 1 cherry blossom recipe. Every balloon I get either gives me more Egg stuff or random junk.
bottlebrush,fmregrd,t1_fmr9mmc,1586320864.0,She was woken from her nap...haha
bayarea,fmls9c5,t3_fvp5bz,1586192286.0,I work at Peninsula Humane Society in Burlingame. We are doing adoptions by appointment only. You can give the main line a call if you are interested. Be warned though - we have been consistently booked about a week in advance for adoptions so you might have to wait.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fmah4uo,t1_fmaacse,1585893960.0,"Manta rays don‚Äôt have stingers! They are a bit different than sting rays. Used to work at an aquarium and got this comment a lot, haha."
