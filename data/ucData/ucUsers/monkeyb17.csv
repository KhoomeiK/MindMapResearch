UCSantaBarbara,fpgyow8,t3_gcxzb6,1588611868.0,"i live there right now, and its not so bad. Not really a loud area, pretty calm for the most part. The building is owned by Harwin, only bad thing about them is that they lag for service requests. Sometimes it gets hot in the rooms cause theyre upstairs and the sun is hitting them directly, the laundry machines arent the best but they get the job done. Overall its not too bad, pretty chill for the most part."
