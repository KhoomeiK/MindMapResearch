LCMS,foyd738,t3_g9xbzp,1588170362.0,"I'm in my mid twenties and I couldn't agree more. I came to Lutheranism from the Assemblies of God and even when I wanted catechesis I found materials and information or classes hard pressed to find. I'm not talking one church I'm talking every church in a 40 min radius. I only found one church in that radius that had liturgical mass and taught classes regularly. It was amazing and I am very greatful for it. But I don't think it's common practice. There were several broadcasts that ""Issues ect."" did called paths to Lutheranism. Path to Lutheranism from Calvinism, or evangelicalism ect. ect. They were spot on and a great listen but maybe they should do a Paths to Lutheranism from Lutheranism."

I promise you 11-13 year olds can understand some of that nitty gritty if not all of it. I would rather give them something possibly beyond their reach at that time and have them grasp some, rather than not give it to them and leave them unprepared."

""If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.""
1 John 1:8

For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.  So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.
Romans 7:14‭-‬25 

So long as we are on this earth and in this flesh we are bound to sin and therefore sinners. Which is why we say we do no good work. We are incapable of doing good work. But any good work that comes through us is Christ in us not ourselves. For our own will is bound to sin. Even though that sin is forgiven and washed away due to the sacrifice of Christ. But I am a sinner and yet what you say is still true, 

>""it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.""

Yes it is and he has. But I am still a sinner who has been set free from it's damning power so long as I walk in faith of Christs all atoning sacrifice. But it's not because of anything I do or anyway I act or could act but purely because he called me and chose me and gave me faith (not something I worked to develop) and saved me and washed away my sins in the waters of baptism. Praise God for he is good. As for me? No I justly deserve his righteous and eternal punishment but he has chosen to save me none the less. Praise God."
TrueChristian,fmyychj,t1_fmy6dqm,1586499690.0,Well we are told to hate sin as God hates sin. But we're also told to love our neighbors as ourselves. And both me and my neighbors are sinners.

TrueChristian,fmuxcer,t1_fmuwk3z,1586400995.0,"You're absolutely right although the answer lied behind not in front 1 Cor. 2:7-9.But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written, ""What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him""—
1 Corinthians 2:7‭-‬9 ESV
So here Paul is referencing the fulfillment of prophecy not what we are to understand of heaven but that the Jewish rules of the time did not recognize the saviour when he had come, or, ""What God has prepared for those who loved him."" Thank you for pointing this out. But the question still stands can we truly know on earth what heaven will be like in entirety?"
TrueChristian,fmuruti,t1_fmun7wc,1586397518.0,"I agree with you ,"" no mind has imagined"" states that pretty clearly for me. We may have an idea of what we thought heaven will be like but it's doesn't come close in the slightest to what heaven is like.  Personally if it's all eternity face down worshiping in the presence of God I will be just fine with that."
