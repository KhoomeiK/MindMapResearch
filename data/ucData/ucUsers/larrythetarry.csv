oilandgasworkers,fpk69fh,t3_gdwn80,1588688805.0,I did my BS ChemE ( good opportunities but not in locations that I wanted) so I went back to school for my MS MechE and now I am working in Aerospace forgings as a QE. I would say most schools do not care what your BS engineering is as long as it is engineering. I would say do your MS in either Mechanical or Civil Engineering. Both are similar to your degree and have good markets to work in.

AskEngineers,fpfhe5z,t1_fpff4xy,1588571308.0,"> Had to work my way through school half the time

Hmm. This is actually nice. It shows grit. Working ( even retail ) while doing engineering in school takes a lot of time management. Sure you didn’t have a mechanical engineering internship but you worker while going to school. Did you work as a cashier and maybe get promoted to shift lead ? That would mean a lot. 

Also networking comes naturally to some while it’s outright difficult for others. I look at networking as increasing my friend circle. I don’t connect with an alumni or a student to get something out of them. I connect with them the same way I made friends when I was 5. I talk to them about their time, ask them about their family ( they ask about mine) and that’s about it. I may or may not ( depending on if I’m looking or not ) let them know that hey I’m in the job market so I’d appreciate it if they know someone to push along my resume. I don’t make a big deal about it, just two friends talking. I do the same for others as well. I’m about 6 years post my BS ( c/o 2014) so I have a bit more experience than you but hey we all started somewhere. For me i had a horrible cGPA for my BS but I love meeting new people and making connections and that has helped me a lot more than my schooling ever did."

changemyview,fnsd4ry,t1_fnrjx2n,1587218997.0,"Ok tell me this: when you went to office hours in person vs online, which was more productive? When you went to a TA with questions which was more helpful online or in person?  When you went to your university library vs your local one to search for a book, which had more resources?  How about when you’re looking for a job ? Virtual career fair vs in person? How about company info sessions? How was networking with your classmates? In person or online ?"
changemyview,fnscdyl,t1_fns0rpb,1587218496.0,"Yes but as an online student I don’t have access to my peers, career services , library, and ton of activities that in person students do."
changemyview,fnsc0ss,t1_fns6bge,1587218253.0,I was sleeping. Lol I posted this last night and now it’s morning. I’m not expected to be on Reddit 24/7.
LosAngelesRams,fnr0h91,t1_fnqzgxw,1587176346.0,I thought we have the LA Galaxy only. Also LA Sparks? I didn’t know we had a WNBA Team. TIL.

EngineeringStudents,fnq5hln,t3_g36wka,1587158056.0,It's a tough time to be graduating and/or looking for internships. Hopefully hiring managers and recruiters will understand
EngineeringStudents,fnq5aw3,t3_g35bv4,1587157955.0,Heck yea bro. 5 year plan is the best. I did one and was the only way I could do a year long internship before graduating.

AskReddit,fnpmh2k,t3_g310ac,1587148092.0,I actually do work out ( go on runs when I get home from work). I don’t see a difference but my shirts do fit better and have gone down 2 notches in my belt so that’s nice.
UCSantaBarbara,fnpjr33,t3_g343gw,1587146713.0,"I graduated in 2014 but from what i can tell, TAs make the course learnable. FWIW the professors teach at such high levels that it's hard to comprehend what they are saying especially at the lower division classes ( Ochem, physics, math). Plus some of these classes ( esp. ochem & physics)are so big that it is impossible to get your questions answered by the professors however their TAs are always helpful and the ones I had really went above and beyond to explain how orgo and magnetism work. I really appreciate my TAs ( more so than my profs. )

commenting on someone's physical features ( good or bad) makes them hate their jobs as well as discredits their ability. This can be a female TA getting: ""she's hot"" or a guy TA getting: ""he can't walk/ or he's ugly"". 

OP, I am sorry you are getting this and it sucks even more when you guys went above and beyond to try and make learning easier while juggling 20 other items on your hands simultaneously."
ChemicalEngineering,fnnnjdi,t3_g2sr85,1587096647.0,"Neither. Get your BS ChemE with the highest grade ( and most internships as possible ) and get out. No employer cares what you did your minor on. If you really want to do a minor, do a minor in CS"
OSUOnlineCS,fnnmj0s,t3_fx52wu,1587095924.0,"I got in Spring 2020 but due to the market situation, i deferred till Winter 2021 when things have calmed down. I am also working and will be taking the 2 year path ( hopefully will be applying to FT SWE after taken majority of the coursework by Summer 2022). I do not want to quit my current job for an internship."
oilandgasworkers,fnmalau,t1_fnlohsr,1587067986.0,"His son couldn’t run the business and when the other guys took over ( current C lvl executives @ BJ), there wasn’t much to be done. Now less than 5 years after sanjel was sold, BJ is looking crappy as well. 

I did a brief stint with Sanjel and learned a lot about fracturing and oil but it sucks that they didn’t last."
