Another thing is remember when cameras were film, and you had a ‘blooper’ moment where child nudity or something like that occurs? . those are valuable bc it’s not explicitly CP so if found, it’s not like a person can be charged bc there’s plausible deniability"

But you’re right, the difference is consent. It’s like the argument of people seeing a woman in her bra and panties versus a bikini (which often show more) but the difference is *consent* . People are consenting to being seen in a bathing suit."

I think there were 5 or 6 masks in the package? I threw one or two out because they were filthy, but then this covid stuff started and now I have a few perfectly good masks, BUT I wouldn’t know if they’re of the standards to medical professionals bc they’ve been in my tool box, dropped on the ground, etc... does anyone know if health care providers will still take them?

With that being said: is our school’s social life a little lackluster? Sure, but Jesus tap dancing Christ, THAT ISNT WHAT COLLEGE IS ABOUT! You’re paying out the ass to LEARN, not party. And there’s places to party, but I think if a school puts so much of their resources on making it a fun and entertaining place to be (like huge sports followings and events) then it’s possible they’re not as concerned with academics.

Before you do anything, look at a timeline that could make sense in finishing your course work. Get a date for when you would want to come back. I looked at old class schedules and the degree works page on the webreg to get an idea of when I could come back and get the classes I’d need.

But even the cdc recommends not testing for herpes bc the stigma of it is worse than the symptoms. Every doctor I’ve spoken to about it (including many doctor clients of mine) agree it’s over hyped bullshit to push anti viral meds. Plus most people who have it, never get symptoms and therefore are unlikely to ever test for it in the first place. Trust me, I’ve done the research on it. Herpes is not a big deal, it shouldn’t be stigmatized as much as it is. Over 20% of the total population are type 2 carriers. That’s billions of people. If something that over a billion people worldwide has that doesn’t do anything other than cause bumps every once in while (like many common skin disorders) the CDC wouldn’t be so ‘meh’ about it"

That’s it. It’s mostly Asymptomatic and doesn’t kill you. Drug manufacturers made a huge deal about herpes to sell medication and used shame as their main marketing draw. And now that shame is constantly being used to denigrate millions of people who have a fucking skin rash.   Also, if she’s a sex worker, I’m willing to bet her clients don’t give a shit about it either since they still book her. Statistically speaking, they have herpes too. Hell, most people get herpes.
