UCSC,fpmswlm,t1_fpmrw3c,1588740848.0,"Yeah thatâ€™s one of my biggest pet peeves about the CS majors at this school, thereâ€™s a sizable number of students who shit on UCSC and the CSE department and blame that for the reason why they canâ€™t get a 6 figure salary out of college. Iâ€™ve interned with other students from some pretty good schools and even they still put in a shit ton of work outside school."

UCSC,fpjbpb9,t1_fpjb62v,1588662797.0,"Yeah I think itâ€™s pretty likely assuming all the pandemic stuff dies down by the end of the year. 

Some companies are taking pretty big financial hits and are hanging on by a thin thread though. It really depends on if the company provides some sort of physical good or service tbh, like Lyft Uber and Airbnb all require people to be outside in order to receive their product/service. So right now theyâ€™re taking a hit, theyâ€™ll most likely survive and bounce back this time next year though. Pure software companies or tech companies that have most of their value derived from their software assets (amazonâ€™s aws for example) will be fine much sooner. Iâ€™d prioritize the latter type of companies over the former when applying for internships/new grad positions"

UCSC,fpiphhb,t3_gdoufz,1588645842.0,"If youâ€™re asking about the current state of CS/SWE opportunities, a decent size of tech companies like Lyft, Airbnb, Uber, and others have cancelled internships and new grad positions. Itâ€™s not impossible per say to find a new grad or internship but itâ€™s likely a lot harder given the pandemic. 

If youâ€™re asking about UCSC and Silicon Valley in general, a good chunk of students here end up going to some great tech companies over the hill. But they donâ€™t do it by simply showing up to class, thereâ€™s a lot of work they do on the sides like side projects, hackathons, interview prep (leetcode + CTCI), etc that makes them desirable to these tech companies."

My first two years at UCSC I got it all paid for through financial aid (including housing) and I still needed to get on calfresh (pretty much food stamps) to have food to eat. I didnâ€™t have enough money to afford my own internet connection so I pretty much did all my work at the library."

UCSC,fow6vys,t1_fovtl3k,1588114120.0,I can agree with pretty much the majority of what your sayin but saying a degree is dead seems extreme. The bare minimum has just been raised

UCSC,fnu74sw,t1_fnu6d8u,1587255905.0,"Yeah same here. I just wanted to point out that if everybody requests this fund, then the people who really do need it (people without a financial safety net) are going to receive very little. $513.88 in Santa Cruz most likely won't even cover one months rent. I would love to have an extra $500 in my bank account but I probably won't request it so that someone else who really does need it, gets it."
UCSC,fnu6pz7,t1_fnu68ui,1587255665.0,"Yeah I really hope that they prioritize the people who need it the most first! It's going to be real tough to distribute fairly because some people who look financially well off on paper may actually really need the emergency fund. And if they go case by case, then it's going to be a long time until everybody gets there emergency fund :/"
UCSC,fnu5zpt,t3_g3vzdg,1587255230.0,"According to the doc it says that UCSC's [""Minimum Allocation to be Awarded for Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/allocationsforsection18004a1ofcaresact.pdf)"" is $9,663,601 and with [UCSC's total student body population at 18,805](https://www.ucsc.edu/about/facts-figures.html), that comes out to $513.88 per student. Assuming every student receives the funds and UCSC only awards the minimum, $513.88 seems super low for an emergency fund. 

Even if UCSC uses the total allocated funds which is $19,327,201 that's still only $1027.77 per student. Again assuming every student receives this emergency fund.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding something but that's pretty far off from $3,000. Just trying to give y'all some perspective on what your expectations should be."

UCSC,fnalivh,t3_g0murv,1586799577.0,"The CS program here is fairly strong, thereâ€™s a decent chunk of CS undergrads graduating with good new grad offers. Really comes down to much you really want it, pushing through the bullshit like online lectures, tough housing market, no parking, etc. Every school has itâ€™s problems youâ€™ll have to deal with. If itâ€™s only between UCR and UCSC, Iâ€™d say go UCSC especially since youâ€™re close but you can succeed at both schools."
UCSC,fna4m0v,t1_fna3w9c,1586790926.0,Pretty much this. In the long run it wonâ€™t matter but if itâ€™s a matter of one more quarter itâ€™s definitely worth it.

UCSC,fn274zk,t3_fyvih7,1586579720.0,"Completely agree with most of your points and the classes you shouted out are on point but the problem with universities teaching specific technologies like react, node.js, etc is that the industry moves pretty quick. By the time universities try to design a course for the latest hottest framework, or language, it might be too late and the technology may be on its way to becoming obsolete. Also companies expect Software Engineers to be able to teach themselves new technologies all the time, so university is the time to teach yourself how to teach yourself new tech."

His passion for the subject also really comes out when heâ€™s explaining stuff. Talk to any of his former students and 90% will say very positive things about him."
