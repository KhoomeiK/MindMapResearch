berkeley,fp7ldfr,t1_fp7ibpd,1588372816.0,"Like maybe something with UX design. Another question. My current plan was to major in COGSCI and Media Studies. But I'm also looking into minoring in Data Science. My question is if I am not able to fit all three in my schedule, should I go with the two majors or Cogsci with data science minor?"
berkeley,fp7hvpi,t1_fp1adjb,1588370925.0,What makes you say that
berkeley,fp3u5jh,t3_gb48dk,1588285859.0,How are cog sci majors doing in this class?
berkeley,fodb7so,t1_foa5nl3,1587682497.0,"Ohh I do see that now. Thanks for clarifying. A question about the co-ops, what’s the best way to guarantee a spot. And is it too late to search for this fall?"
berkeley,foa3m0k,t1_fo9r1gs,1587638678.0,"Hey jack off,

I’m assuming you just live in Berkeley, and don’t attend the university because your research skills don’t show it. 

The guy went back to India to do his dirty work. Don’t call it the Middle East. Either call it India or call it Asia cuz that’s what it is. Just because you don’t wanna taint the idea of Asia that it’s on, don’t push the idea that this rapist is from the Middle East region. Cuz he is not. That area already gets a lot of racial discrimination and hate and does not need more. 

In other terms I do wanna know what your idea is. Tell us what us 18-24 year olds can do when half the goddamn city’s property is owned by him and there is a housing crisis happening. Cuz I’m all ears and need a place to live next year

Sincerely, 
A student at cal :D"

berkeley,fo7od9j,t3_g6641m,1587581769.0,Just say your parents are dead and put independent. You don’t have to be 24. You just have to be fully independent. The 24 thing is like a guideline to make it easier.
SkincareAddiction,fnwc3xx,t1_fnvx6bt,1587315532.0,ohhhh okay thank you. I’ve been using the night cream and it feels nice but for some reason my skin seems to get red for like a minute after I apply it.

frugalmalefashion,fng3s3w,t3_g1eh2i,1586921636.0,did you see the boneyard match they did. Maybe some work more like that would help in this time
frugalmalefashion,fnfxebv,t1_fnfw8ae,1586917515.0,"I think their winning right now financially. Sure they lost crowds, but they don’t have to rent out arenas for now and they are in a building that they own. On top of that, they’re one of the only sports still being televised, so that’s gotta be some growth right?"
frugalmalefashion,fnfx8t2,t1_fnfnzgg,1586917420.0,Lmao the other day he said he has $500 million in cash on hand for all his ventures. Look it up
SkincareAddiction,fn9b126,t3_g00uf7,1586765956.0,How are you liking Acure
ucla,fmxdrwb,t3_fxy4rl,1586463100.0,Bruh berkeley doin the same shit for our bus passes as if our “on campus housing” isn’t a half mile away from campus
SkincareAddiction,fmu33rd,t1_fmrtpbo,1586383671.0,I just see a whole lot of bumps on my skin which makes me think it might be oily. But I honestly can not tell
SkincareAddiction,fmrjuox,t3_fwtebm,1586325422.0,Okay thank you. I will attempt to find a hydrating toner
SkincareAddiction,fmrjb9p,t1_fmriasi,1586324937.0,Okay thank you. So should I continue to use my skincare that is intended for normal to dry skin (primarily just the face wash is because my moisturizer says all skin type. The cream I use at night I think is made for dry skin). Or should I switch to one for oily skin (like a foaming cleanser?)
SkincareAddiction,fmri64u,t1_fmr8k5d,1586323938.0,"So until I can get a new toner, do you think I should use witch hazel or use no toner? Toner is something that i recently added to my routine in the last two weeks so I don’t mind taking it back out"
SkincareAddiction,fmqn2i4,t1_fmqhvvv,1586302870.0,Wait so do you think I might have oily skin that is just dehydrated?
ucla,fmfq2yx,t1_fmcwnka,1586032493.0,"No reason really. I love berkeley, but wanna know the experience and the life of living in SoCal."
