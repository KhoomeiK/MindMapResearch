linuxmasterrace,fotzhaz,t1_fotyttu,1588071597.0,"I have the 12.9 inch iPad Pro, and I used to be a pen and notebook guy for years before. I found my note taking to become magnitudes more efficient after I got the iPad (and I use the notability app). First, my notes have become more organized. Previously I would either use a notepad or notebook to take notes and when I fill one up, I’d start a new one, and eventually I have a stack of filled notebooks where each contains a subsection for each lecture. When I’m working on homework and need to reference a page, that means sorting through every notebook to find a single page. With the iPad, each section is titled and searchable. Second, I always used a black ink pen and occasionally a highlighter. The denser the notes become, the more difficult it is to find important definitions or distinguish different sections. With the iPad I have almost a hundred colors of pen and highlighter to choose from. Third, drawing graphs and diagrams are so much easier when straight lines and curves are snapped to be perfect. You can also copy and paste, which is a huge efficiency improvement. Also, if it’s something too complicated to draw, just take a picture on insert it into the notes! You can also draw on the picture! Finally, I’d say the ability to open a textbook/web browser side by side to the note app is a game changer. I don’t need to lug around textbooks on campus, and there’s less moving my head/eyes while working. 

Bonus: I can export my notes as pdf"

edmproduction,fof8k1c,t3_g70f8r,1587729560.0,"Step away from serum and learn synthesis first. Then you’ll learn to appreciate all the features serum has.

Syntorial and Sylenth really helped me learn from a foundational perspective where I really learned how individual effects and envelopes can help me build that sound in my head. I really recommend it."

snowboarding,fmku22w,t1_fmk609t,1586168672.0,"Rip sticks are fun to ride, but I’ve always felt like they were limiting. There aren’t many tricks you can do on them and don’t even think about going downhill with them.

Skateboarding on ramps are the way to go for strength/balance training. Another option is longboarding if you want a mellower learning curve."
snowboarding,fmktxej,t1_fmk7h9j,1586168526.0,"Hey, no need to get defensive about it. I’m giving you my personal experience, and how it’s improved my snowboarding. We’re all trying to get better at snowboarding aren’t we? 

If you don’t want to skateboard, don’t do it. However, you can’t deny the fact that a very high proportion of professional snowboarders are also skateboarders, and they aren’t skateboarding because it’s another hobby. The best half pipe snowboarders are also crazy fucking good at vert skateboarding. Board slides on snowboards and skateboards are almost identical in feeling and upper body motion. 

Anyways, you do however you want. I’m just another stranger on the internet."
