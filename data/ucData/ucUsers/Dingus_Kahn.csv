when people say ""A wrap"" they mean that the T's are wrapping A, it's a call out that implies arch presence into A site"

Brackets control is what you mean. IDK what inferno you are playing, but brackets control 100% dictates your presence on the map WAY more than banana control. Watch any pro demo and the max they leave in banana T side every round is 1 person holding for pushes after showing presence."

VALORANT,forvnj3,t1_fopqv96,1588019311.0,"...

how much effort does it take to raze grenade a room and get a free >75 damage nade regardless, or forcing someone to swing an angle and die guarenteed?

It takes a lot of high intelligence to shoot a sova arrow over the map randomly to spot a site for free

It takes a lot of hard work to learn lineups, its totally not a 5 minute thing anyone can do in any game"
VALORANT,fonypvl,t1_fon8ycr,1587929098.0,">relatively low intelligence

What the fuck does this mean? People who played CS before Valorant was released are stupid? What goes through your brain to think like this"

LivestreamFail,fo5iuwg,t1_fo5h9kf,1587526714.0,"idk if we are watching the same games man, Valorant is so slow that it can be absolutely boring to watch every team drag out the clock for 2 minutes every round, at least in CS teams are forced to take space and run defaults but in Valorant all the space is essentially taken for you (besides lucky pushes). Overwatch has constant action and can atleast be visually stimulating as a viewer for more than 20 minutes."

Discord can't do more than 50 in one room, and it used to be 10 before COVID-19 hit. I have a class of 450 people, so how would that work. Even though it has the best text chat and voice clarity of all the options, who cares when it's only for lecture?

Skype sucks for everything

Google classroom is pretty scuffed if I remember correctly

Zoom works fine for me, idk what problems you could possibly have.

edit: zoom is definitely shady but it is the easiest platform in a pinch right now."
