I don‚Äôt know a single motherfucker who has died from the fucking flu. And those numbers of flu deaths are counted a different way using different algorithms. In laymen‚Äôs terms, if we counted flu deaths like coronavirus deaths there would be 3k-15k. Which is vastly less than the amount of deaths in a country, yeah?

Going outside for walks in some locations can *spread disease*, have you ever taken a basic biology class before? Where are you basing these claims of authoritarianism? This isn‚Äôt being done to compromise our rights, it‚Äôs being done to protect us from something that has infected literally millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people. The free market won‚Äôt save you from a virus, social distancing will. In fact, various models project that the economic downfall experienced in a post-COVID world will be greatly amplified if social distancing ceases - can‚Äôt have an economy if even 1% of the people actively contributing to it die. It‚Äôs a lot to ask a teenage redditor who knows relatively nothing regarding the world, but show me the vast research you‚Äôve done about totalitarianism, human rights, and virology that aspired you to make these baseless claims. Give me numbers, statistics that say that social distancing will kill more people than Coronavirus."

CoronavirusMemes,fp1q5pb,t1_fp1pld4,1588244282.0,"My man, I see you haven‚Äôt studied epidemiology, economics, or basic statistics. At some point, you‚Äôre right, people need income and we have to start cutting our losses. As of now, Covid-19 is the leading cause of death in America - we haven‚Äôt even hit our peak. If we reopen, 60,000 deaths will become 100,000 which will become 200,000. Telling folks to stay at home isn‚Äôt oppression, it‚Äôs the government trying to prevent as much mortality as possible. No one likes this, no governors/scientists/economists/federal officials/doctors/EDUCATED people enjoy telling people to stay at home, and they know it‚Äôs bad publicity. There isn‚Äôt a solution completely in view yet. However, most people including myself sorely doubt that 60,000 people are dying in the next few weeks due to lockdown. So, as politely as I can state this, try to inform yourself of issues you are vastly oversimplifying and stay home."

Let me just tell my President, Prime Minister, or King/Queen buddies to be more aware of human rights - everyone should take off their clothes and stop using technology because it‚Äôs made by practically child slaves in China!

Do I like either? Hell no. Back to DeSantis. He claims Florida is flattening the curve, yet they haven‚Äôt even hit their peak yet.
