berkeley,flspy14,t1_flshp03,1585447892.0,"I'm a first year right now who is not majoring in SED but in Urban Studies, but we all take mostly the same classes since both majors are in the College of Environmental Design (CED). 

Most CED kids take ED 1 their first semester. I took it last semester with Nathan John and I struggled a lot, mostly because I'm not very creative compared to some other people. However, most people seem to enjoy it. The class revolves around a final project where you have to carve a city you design out of a book. There's lecture where we talk about architecture and design over the years, although I found my professor's lectures slightly incoherent. I've talked to older students who took the class before and they had better experiences than I did. The class also has a discussion section where we discuss weekly readings (around 20-100 pages per week lol) for the first half of section and then discuss the weekly homework assignment for the last half of class. I personally enjoyed section more than lecture because you work with a smaller group of students and get to know each other more. 

The other courses that most first years take are ED 4A (Fall only), 4B (Spring only), and 4C (spring only). Of these three classes, you only need to take two. I didn't take 4A, but some people I know took 4A and enjoyed it. All I know is that you make some posters.

I'm taking both 4B and 4C right now and I'm enjoying both. 4B is split into three modules focusing on Architecture, Planning, and Landscape Architecture. I'm enjoying lecture much more than I did anything from ED 1. However, I will admit that your enjoyment really depends on the professor teaching that module. I was constantly bored during the Architecture module because the professor was very monotone while I'm enjoying the Planning module much more (we haven't started the Landscape Architecture module yet). The assignments in this class revolve around position papers. The first two are mostly about self-exploration while the last two focus on urban issues in cities.

4C, like 4B (and presumably 4A), is split into the same three modules. ED 4C is probably my favorite CED class so far. The professors have been excellent and like interacting with the students. This class mostly focuses on sustainability and ecologies, like how we can build net-zero buildings or plan for more efficient transportation. The assignments in this class revolve around diagram assignments where you create a diagram that conveys information in response to a prompt related to the module. For example, our last assignment had us creating a diagram detailing why one method of transportation is better than another. 

Although we're not in the same major, I hope you found this helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions!"
