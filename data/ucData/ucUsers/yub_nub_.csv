ucla,fp4kdee,t1_foxpy7r,1588300963.0,They are pretty respectful when I put the sign up. My building is just 2 levels in a U shape so it is a communal patio and people hang out outside a lot when it is nice out. Can get very distracting
ucla,forvzdj,t1_foru9os,1588019474.0,I have to put up a sign at least once a week for the rest of the quarter. Just trying to keep it fun while trying not to lose my mind :D
ChemicalEngineering,fogbu35,t1_fof9b8s,1587750573.0,"This is the book we use at UCLA. I usually just get PDFs of books, however my TA recommended buying it and his copy was barely holding together. I think that is the highest praise a textbook can get. I really like how they actually explain the examples and there is a lot of information explained well in the book."
GalaxysEdge,fo56qcy,t1_fo4nq0x,1587518710.0,Definitely a once in a lifetime experience
GalaxysEdge,fo4m4ld,t1_fo41e0z,1587506916.0,"We went day 1 of reservation period at 8 am, so first guests in. I still get goosebumps everytime I think about it. It was so amazing."
GalaxysEdge,fo3yot2,t1_fo3tgbw,1587495205.0,"I went during the reservation period at the beginning so it was very rushed, but it was really cool. We went at night and you couldn't really see all the options for the hilt builds so I probably would have gone with something else but I'm not sure. However, being in the room and building it was an awesome experience I must say. At one point I got goosebumps."
Nails,fo3fzxx,t3_g5ibve,1587486262.0,"Top coat glows in the dark too, although not very well unless you stick it under the UV light for a minute first"
Disneyland,fo3fedd,t1_fo12kl7,1587485970.0,They also shut down the app about a year ago I want to say. It was the best because then we didn't have to carry our purchases around the park with us all day as well. They just chose to merge the Disney store and the app so APs no longer get a discount anywhere online for merch.
Disneyland,fo11cgw,t1_fo10hf3,1587423782.0,I mean they took away ShopDisney over a year ago I want to say. So this was before the whole park closure stuff.
Disneyland,fo118rj,t1_fo107up,1587423724.0,"The discount for the Visa isn't that great, I've never really used it because my AP discount is better. I forgot about it TBH."
GalaxysEdge,fo0riax,t3_g51ruz,1587418418.0,"The purple is from Savi's workshop and the blue is the ""Rey's Lightsaber"" which should just be called ""Luke's Lightsaber"" and ""The Golden God"" painting in the corner. I love Ewoks!"
Disneyland,fo0h6mf,t1_fo0b25x,1587413067.0,If they were truly sorry they would change it haha
Disneyland,fo0h599,t1_fo0bf7w,1587413047.0,I feel like getting rid of it was just so disney could make a few extra bucks by denying APs discounts for unless they are actually on property. I just want the discount on things I can buy in the park. I'm fine paying full price at the Disney store in the mall or online for things I can't get in the park. Oh well
GalaxysEdge,fnzx2yz,t3_g4uq7a,1587402246.0,Wow! That's a lot of droids! How did you get the distressed/dirty look? and I love the custom paint jobs on the middle 3!
StarWars,fnz3epg,t3_g4qfbk,1587384941.0,"R series. I love mine! I've heard about so many problems with the BB series. My R series works just fine on the carpet, not as fast as hard surfaces, but still fine."
StarWars,fnz1i6x,t3_g4r5ct,1587383291.0,"The purple lightsaber was my own custom build at Savi's Workshop and the blue is the ""Rey's Lightsaber"" that should just be called ""Luke's Lightsaber"" from Disneyland."
ChemicalEngineering,fnz0up5,t3_g4lipr,1587382691.0,"I am a current Chem E transfer at UCLA and I have to say I love it. There are a lot of resources for transfers which I have found super helpful and I have a great group of friends, none of whom I knew before I transferred. I don't know how big the programs are at the other schools, but at UCLA it is a very small program so you have all the same kids in your core classes which makes finding people to study with easier. Feel free to message me if you have any questions about life as a transfer Chem E at UCLA, or any transfer questions in general."
