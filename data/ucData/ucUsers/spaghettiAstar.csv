So in context here, what he's saying is that the poster greentext image basically just said a version of the aristocrats joke, the ""punchline"" of the joke being ""And she was a good friend."" because it's out of place with all the weird sex stuff he has before it.

I never said anything bad about him, and have intentionally not done so in this thread because I am such a fan of his. It's why I'm disappointed in his opinion, I simply disagree with it, both in terms of his statement about Rian, and in terms of how Luke was portrayed. For what it's worth, in the Lucas ST Luke also exiled himself at an ancient Jedi temple while Kylo was out doing bad shit. Kylo was simply called Jedi Killer at the time, so we don't know how connected Luke was going to be to him, but he was going to be disillusioned with a lot of stuff, and self exiled. Story group members have said that TLJ Luke was very close to the characterization of Luke that George had, so to me, that says Rian did the correct thing. Sam can disagree, I disagree with him as a result, I feel like if it's true that George's Luke was similar, then that's enough for me to assume George would disagree as well. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't see anything to suggest otherwise, so why not.

Doesn't mean I like Sam any less or are any less appreciative about what he's brought to the franchise in terms of characters like Maul, and Starkiller. I hope they give him other roles to play as well so he can continue to be part of it."
StarWarsCantina,fpl3e4l,t1_fpkwqei,1588705659.0,"They *think* that's where he went. They are correct, but that's what they think.

So it would make sense that someone like Leia, Han, or Lando would have heard from Luke about how he found the first Jedi temple, but since Luke was secretive about some stuff, he probably told them that he would never tell anyone where it was to protect it. So when he goes into exile, Leia, Han, Lando, or those who know him best, figure he went to the place where only he knows where it is.

So they found Lor San Tekka (old guy at the beginning of TFA) who helped Luke with finding lost Jedi relics, who gives them a piece of the puzzle to the first Jedi temple. 

I arrived that the above spot before TLJ released, FYI, I figured Luke went into exile like Yoda did after TFA, there wasn't anything that suggested Luke was going away to find some MacGuffin that would be the secret to winning the day, that's never been what Star Wars has been about other than TROS, which obviously came after."

I think ideally, I'd have the next chapter focus on the Sicilian and Italian campaigns. Sicily can have the 82nd and Brits dropping in (a lesser known airborne drop, fits in with the theme already), and there are a number of iconic maps/locations from the Sicilian and Italian campaigns to work. Additionally they could bring the Italians in as a faction, which would be fun.

Then North Africa would be another interesting one for the completely different terrain that we'd get with it. It could have some tank heavy maps as well for an interesting dynamic.

Southern France would be interesting since I don't know of any games that have gone to that setting (I'm sure some older ones have that I'm forgetting, but I can't think of any major ones off the top of my head), and of course the Eastern Front or Pacific Theater would be amazing.

I have a theory that subconsciously a lot of people are jealous that Rian is the one fan living out his dream and that's why they get so pissy about him.

Rian has stated his love for EU books (which we saw he had a ton in his personal library), said that his favorite game is Knights of the Old Republic, watched all the movies, has openly talked about how he loved to talk Star Wars during the earlier days of the internet, etc.

Rian is a Star Wars fan through and through, from the very beginning.

And sure, if you're unconvinced, I can see why you'd think that.

Sidious has basically slapped him a few times here, so it would make sense that Maul would be building up Crimson Dawn before the Empire gets wise and shuts them down. That results in Maul trying to find a way to defeat Vader, and thus Malachor comes into play, because if Maul can defeat Vader he can possibly win back favor. Everything else he's done (including the Siege of Mandalore) has been about getting Papa Palpie's attention, and Maul thinks if he can kill Vader and all other rivals then Sidious will bring him back into the fold. Then Maul will eventually kill Sidious and take control of the Sith Empire. He's a good Sith afterall and that's what they do.

Wolffe didn't kill Plo and Gregor is MIA last we've seen so he may have never gotten the order at all. 

In the absence of information, make up your own head canon for how they come to be.

Mine is that Wolffe was injured at the time and missed the order. Since Plo was shot down, he basically fell through the gaps and when he woke up from his bacta bath everything had already changed. Rex, knowing that Wolffe was injured and under during Order 66 ""returns to service"" just long enough to find Wolffe and get him out before it's too late. In the medical bay, Rex has Wolffe's chip removed, and they escape. While searching for far lost planets to stay away from the Empire they run into Gregor Gregor, who's been MIA for a while now also never got the order, and Rex is able to get his chip out as well.

However, while getting Gregors chip, they attract the attention of the Empire. While able to conceal that they removed their chips, the Empire basically issues a threat in regards to them basically causing up any type of trouble at all and then leaves them be. The result is that Wolffe grows paranoid because he has only seen small bits of the Empire for his escape, or heard stories from Rex, which is why he's trying to keep Rex from contacting anyone that could be on their bad side. Gregor is a little goofy from the head injuries, but otherwise fine, and Rex keeps them gang together.

In legends they have Cody develop PTSD over it, and I would think that probably happens with a number of clones who served from the beginning.

Expect EA to pump out three Star Wars game right at the end of their license cycle (Fallen Order 2, Battlefront 3, and maybe a third one) in hopes that a strong finish gives them a renewal.

Right now they're putting all hands on deck for Battlefield 6 after Battlefield 5 tanked, which worries me a little.. Not for other projects, but the issue with 5, from what I could tell, was the completely flawed business model from the start. I didn't play it, because the game looked arcadey and not at all my style/ They basically screwed with the battlefield formula and nobody was happy. Nobody wants New Coke, they want Classic Coke.

Hopefully they're able to expand and grow on this foundation for future games, but my guess is they'll be moving to a new engine and will have to start from scratch in terms of content.

Interestingly enough, we saw the Rams start to incorporate that with Higbee late in the season, and he got some huge runs after catch as a result. I hope that's a result of McVay figuring out how to take advantage and the Rams can incorporate it more with both him and Everett.

The Director and the Jedi is just a really interesting look of how he made the movie, you see a lot of the process, and you get some extra little details and context behind scenes. It's really well done, and I can't recommend it enough, even for people who hate the movie, just to get to see how one is made.

The short The Balance of the Force is a great little thing where Rian talks about Luke and the Force, really gives you insight into what Luke's state of mind at this point.

The scene breakdowns aren't really relevant in terms of the story, but they're cool to see how they set up and did different scenes, just a good background thing."

Additionally in the last 5 years especially the home movie watching experience has significantly improved with larger, clearly TV screens at a cheaper price, better sound at a cheaper price, and things like backlighting being readily available at low prices, which has caused a dip in people going out to the movies in general. That's why streaming is becoming such a huge part of TV, and why so many companies are starting to invest more in lengthy high quality TV shows rather than big budget movies.

Rogue One and Solo also used more of Lucasfilm than TFA and TROS, but none of the Disney movies come close to the collaboration between the director/writer and Lucasfilm as TLJ.

Rian Johnson actually moved to Skywalker Ranch and met with Filoni and the story group multiple times per week during story development. He watched episodes of Rebels and TCW that Dave recommended to him, worked closely and developed a close friendship with the story group that he maintains today (same with Dave, they still chat today).. The story group and Dave were *all* over that TLJ script, and in fact there have been people who work for Lucasfilm who were present for the very first George meetings about his ST, before he ever sold to Disney, as well as in those initial Disney meetings with George and their meetings early on during ST development once they bought it. Their take? Rian Johnson tried to move the ST back closer to what George Lucas initially intended, while J.J. moved it more in other directions. Lucasfilm, clear by their media, loved working with Rian on TLJ more than TFA and TROS, shit the dedication sections of the visual dictionaries are enough proof of that. TFA and TROS get a nice generic letter of thanks from Pablo Hidalgo, with most emphasis on Lucasfilm employees and hardly any mention of J.J. and his crew... While the one for TLJ has a huge section where Pablo just lays on the praise for Rian Johnson.. Dave Filoni hasn't even made a tweet regarding any  of the live action movies other than a doodle a few days after TROS suggesting Ahsoka isn't dead as some fans were speculating after the movie.. Except he made a custom doodle about TLJ saying he hopes fans love it as much as he and the Rebels crew did.

Point is, Rian worked very close with Lucasfilm during production at every step. He moved there, became friends with them, and maintains that friendship. It's clear when LF employees do talk in more free environments that they have nothing but glowing praise for TLJ and just professional courtesy towards J.J.

Meanwhile J.J. refused to work with Lucasfilm, instead working with his own production company Bad Robot, took TFA script (already written) and re-worked it largely by himself until Lawrence Kasdan came in to help clean it up and Star Wars it, and in terms of TROS he and Chris were just writing it down in LA in coffee shops blabbing about plot points until they realized they should talk in code. Additionally. J.J. has had people who mostly work for/with him publicly trash TLJ and Rian Johnson in what appeared to be a strange attempt to make TROS look better. I don't think that J.J. sent them to say those things of course, but it's just a bad look all the way around when you work with people who don't understand that basic rule of thumb in Hollywood that you don't trash something you didn't work on.

That's not to say that TFA and TROS are bad and people can't like it... However, it's very clear from top to bottom that TLJ was the most that Lucasfilm was involved with a movie since Lucas was at the helm, and they have nothing but love for it.

Some students who are more interested in the subject have been following along textbooks and my original syllabus more, plus taking advantage of my extended office hours to virtually meet with me in smaller groups and one on one.

My favorite still is a student of mine who says that video games help him relax and take his mind off everything else going on around him.

I expect us to have our primary home be the light blue and yellow that they've been going with on the branding, and our away uniform be white tops with yellow pants.

“I’ve had trouble accepting what he saw for Luke, but again, I have to say, having seen the movie, **I was wrong**.”

>I said PC reasons because at the end of the day TLJ had scenes that did not make any sense in the slightest, the one i referred to was Holdo being in charge and not informing anyone of the plan just because, there was no reason not to inform Poe other than to blindly trust your superior, who in this case was Holdo with 4 FEMALE assistants all standing by her, no males, that was my issue

It makes perfect sense from a military perspective. Poe was recently demoted for making a tactical mistake. He was a combat pilot and Squadron leader without a starfighter to fly and a large amount of his subordinates recently KIA. He had no business knowing anything, she was clearly coordinating with other flag officers, to be honest I had no idea the gender of the others in the background because I wasn't paying attention to that. The fact that not only it stood out to you, but you are pointing it out as a *negative* does in fact speak volumes about your character. What the hell does the fact that they're female have to do with anything? They can't have a command role because they're a female? I've seen some pretty kickass females in the military serving in combat, the fact they're female means nothing.

>On the race thing you are just downright stupid, i'm British Asian and have long been vocal about ethnic minorities being represented in hollywood, and that's what SW is, a vast universe with different skin colours and looks so don't go playing the racist card when i did not mention race.

Oh and British people can't be racist? Neither can Asians? I bet it would sure be super difficult to possibly find any evidence of racism among either of those two demographics, huh? Racism crosses all barriers bro, where you are from, especially fucking Britain, for fucks sake, I've lived there don't try to paint a rosy picture, and what race you are doesn't magically shield you. But sure, you may not be racist, it seems clear to me that your issue with ""PC"" is the fact that there were females, not other demographics. Congrats I guess.

Keep citing polls that can be manipulated by people, and some that have openly been manipulated though. All the polls that have been out that didn't allow for that, you know the ones that are higher, sure didn't do that. As for your opinion, you can have it, never said otherwise. Your opinion isn't fact, so when you're trying to pull bullshit out, twist facts, and negate the truth, it sort of shows how popular of an opinion it really is.

>As an example, when Holdor went to Hyperdrive through the enemy ship, that is not how it works, you don't just go really fast in space, that is one of the many things wrong IN MY OPINION.

Yeah, see here's the thing. Your opinion is wrong. Like just wrong, full stop. It is literally Star Wars canon that the Holdo Maneuver became ""possible"" within the universe (meaning that hyperspace was established as working in the same way) during season one of The Clone Wars when George Lucas was still running the show. This has been repeated by *several* people who work for Lucasfilm, including the Story Group. The head writer for the season of TCW says it, the canon says it, it's all there and it's been there. Your opinion doesn't shield you from being wrong. You are the one that is incorrect and that is it, to argue otherwise is the same as arguing that the fact that 2+2=4 is wrong because it's your opinion that it's wrong. Life doesn't work that way.
