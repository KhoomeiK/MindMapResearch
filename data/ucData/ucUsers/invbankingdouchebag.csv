wownoob,foiumpt,t1_foisc0p,1587797559.0,I first got into WoW with my 2010 MacBook Pro. FPS and graphics were fine but my god did it turn into a military grade heater... I used to sweat when I played.
berkeley,fohk8vk,t1_fohgov1,1587767353.0,"I as a transfer highly dissent with a “loss of experience” at a CC. My 2 year cc experience was absolutely amazing and I made several of my closest friends there. I had made lots of memories and got the right foundation to transfer. The camaraderie in the dorms was great and it was nice to live in unit 3 with both transfers and freshman. Again, it entirely depends on the community college you go to, but for me looking back I would not be at Cal today if it wasn’t for me making the decision to go to cc. The professors were great and the faculty was amazing."
