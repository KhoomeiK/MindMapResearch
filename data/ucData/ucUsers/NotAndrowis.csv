She said, ‚Äú1 or 2 do not make a difference, it only matters when you have 10+ on your transcript because then when future employers see your transcript they are going to be like ‚Äòwhat is this‚Äô‚Äù. W and F both will appear on your transcript even if retaken. But a W looks 1000x better than an F."

UCSD,fp59rbt,t3_gb564t,1588321316.0,"I talked to them. It‚Äôs not like that. P/NP doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with GPA. So you can take all P/NP and still be fine. In addition, you can do all P/NP but on 1 class and that class will determines how your gpa for the quarter goes."

UCSD,fof8fth,t3_g6vn8v,1587729459.0,"I talked to a few people (some at this school and some elsewhere) who are in the same situation. They said that they were going to elect to take a few more classes to stay a little longer because of everything going on. With the covid crisis, the job market is crazy so they felt that they‚Äôd rather wait for things to get less foggy. I don‚Äôt know if that helps but it‚Äôs not the craziest of ideas."
UCSD,fof83p4,t3_g74t2u,1587729165.0,"No. 

First of all, I got accepted to this school without a major. So they accepted my application and I did not know I was majorless until the first week of school. School policy makes you apply separately for capped majors when that‚Äôs the case (some are lottery, some are finishing prescreening courses, and some are highest gpa get in). When I told them that, they said, ‚ÄúWell we tried to have some people spread the word during triton day‚Äù (a non-required random day for students that could afford the trip to come and see the school). 2 years in now, I‚Äôve had to complete change my major. I had an open door for me at a big military company in the event I got my bachelors (they were going to allow me to get my masters with them years down). Now, I am going to be forced to pursue a masters right away cause the firm was looking for a bachelors in a certain major. Anyways, that‚Äôs just my problem as far as school policy. There are so many other dumb policies that you‚Äôd have to be here to see. 

Second, the school is extremely depressing. There is zero to no social life and an extreme lack of diversity in regards to race. The thoughts that come to your mind when you hear ‚Äúfun college experience‚Äù is the exact opposite of what you‚Äôll see here. People I know literally go to SDSU or even as far as UCLA just to experience a lively campus life and have fun because UCSD lacks any of that. People will say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs what you make of it‚Äù... no that is stupid and illogical. If I throw a party and am the only one there, I‚Äôm tryna make something of it, but obviously there‚Äôs nothing there. This school lacks any social life. 

The school itself is okay. The location is absolutely amazing. Not too far the beach. And the weather in San Diego is amazing for the most part. The school is ironically listed as one of the ugliest schools in America but that‚Äôs just cuz they don‚Äôt have anything relatively interesting or appealing besides a library that looks like a spaceship and a random building with a fake house on the edge of it. 

As far as comparing to other UCs, UCSD is ranked around the 3-5 best on academic standards. I have family at other UCs and they seem to have a better time overall and even as far as quality.

A big issue I have with UCSD is the teaching system. They main reason they hire people is for their research capabilities. I‚Äôve had many instructors straight up say that in the first week. Many of whom are first time teachers or grad students who don‚Äôt have a clue about getting people to learn. 

Comparing this school to others overall... We are a quarter system which means we work on a 10 week schedule while a majority of other schools are semester system and they work on 18 week schedule. It is very fast paced and if you fall behind you‚Äôre screwed (spoken through experience of medical emergency). Friends I have at other schools seem to like the ability to get their degree in the same time but with a nicer and mellow speed. 

The school‚Äôs advisors never seem to be very helpful. Getting help requires going through multiple different departments instead doing the logically thing of having them work together. The school has 6 soon to be 7 and then 8 different colleges within the universities and all have their own system. 

I feel likes it‚Äôs an obvious thing that shouldn‚Äôt need to be said but I will say it. The school does not care about you. They care about money. They care about what they can bring in. That‚Äôs why they are a considered on the best research schools because they bring in people who can do research. Not the best for the students. Not the best for the quality. Only the best for making money and furthering their agenda. 

People might want to argue otherwise but it‚Äôs just ignorant thinking. Evidence with them being one the last of the schools to act on the Covid problems. They still wanted students to come and continue funneling money. Even with everything and all online classes we are still forced to pay full tuition for useless pre-recorded lectures, some of which were done years ago. 

Overall, going back to your original question. I would redo my decision in a heartbeat. I, along with and a lot of current students and alumni, believe that UCSD is a little bit overhyped. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it is considered  very prestigious by name but there is not much behind the curtain. I got accepted into Cal Poly SLO but turned it down for living situation purposes. Also got waitlisted then accepted for USC but couldn‚Äôt afford it. Biggest regret was getting into SDSU and even having them agree to pay most of tuition, but I turned it down for the ‚Äúprestige‚Äù of UCSD. Probably the biggest mistake I‚Äôve made in my (admittedly short) life was going to UCSD. Had I known what I know now, I would have rather saved the money and resources by going to a community college for a year or two and then transferring to an even better school."
UCSD,fo5n1ty,t3_g5u71p,1587529814.0,"International is the opposite of unique at UCSD. 40% of the school is international. Advice for getting in... first and foremost, get test scores up as high as possible. Work on GPA. Write good essays and get them proofread. I don‚Äôt know if you have an AP courses system or something similar but take a few. ECs (assuming extra curricular) are nice to have I guess. I had 2500 hours but they‚Äôre not anywhere close to being important as scores. Your major could also play a big part in acceptance. Common majors like Bio and MAE are highly applied to... what happens is sometimes they might accept you majorless or just send a rejection letter. You should pursue what you want, but that is just something that needed to be said. Also, fill in the 1st and 2nd choice for majors on the application."
UCSD,fnrxbs5,t3_g3e5bj,1587205199.0,Talk to the professor and see if they will sign off on a ‚Äúlate add‚Äù petition. Explain that you‚Äôve already been in the class. Worked for me once before.

UCSD,fn91gbq,t3_fzqi0x,1586756322.0,"The school when I entered had numbers of African American students that you could literally count. This year I saw a few more which is obviously great. It‚Äôs disgusting how undiversified the school is. I don‚Äôt have a problem with the Asian population. They are not bad people in the slightest and I don‚Äôt want anyone to think I think that. But a majority of the school is at least 75% Asian (international and American). I‚Äôm surprised this school hasn‚Äôt gotten in trouble with an Affirmative Action lawsuit. I‚Äôve had classes where professors break down how the demographics are. There were some that showed 1% African American rate. That‚Äôs crazy. Plus, to boost the ‚ÄúWhite/Caucasian‚Äù demographic and basically rig the system, they‚Äôll bunch up several other groups i.e. Middle Easterns to form higher numbers. As far as your fear of racism and oppression, I haven‚Äôt heard or seen any issues on campus (hard to oppress a group that isn‚Äôt well represented at the school). Again, despite the crazy high majority, the Asian population is pretty chill. They don‚Äôt make problems and I, at least personally, haven‚Äôt felt they‚Äôve done anything to infringe on one‚Äôs personal comfort. It‚Äôs just disappointing to see such a big lack of diversity for other groups at such a ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù school."
UCSD,fn8zsz3,t3_g0cb2p,1586754867.0,"Personally, being in stem at UCSD I can tell you that a majority of the professors do... well... suck. They are hired for their research contribution and are only there 2-3 and dip for that purpose. That being said, it is a good school to have on your bachelors. I don‚Äôt know much about grade deflating (think it‚Äôs mostly rumors though). Classes are hard in the sense that most these people aren‚Äôt teachers but people hired for research that do teach during their time spent. I‚Äôve had multiple professors straight-up tell the students at the end of the quarter that ‚Äúthey were hired for research not teaching‚Äù. It is hard to get an ‚ÄúA‚Äù considering the 10 week quarters are very fast passed especially for harder classes like OChem. I don‚Äôt personally thinks it‚Äôs hard to do well if you are a hard-working student, but the straight A‚Äôs you‚Äôre looking to get are not always going to be the case. From the people I‚Äôve talked to further in the medical career, a lot of them say this, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs better getting a 3.5 gpa at UCSD or a 4.0 at another university? Cuz there‚Äôs people who don‚Äôt necessarily go to UC schools and still turn out to be great doctors, etc.‚Äù Also, they‚Äôve all said that doing super well at any school along with a lot of volunteering and internship/shadowing experiences go a long way. Anyways. Just my two-cents. Hope it helps."

UCSD,fmnxi6z,t3_fwev8g,1586238239.0,"I came into UCSD pursuing Aero. First things first, go where you feel you will be happiest. Both schools are prestigious and you should be proud of yourself. Being in Sixth College, I feel that I got lucky because a lot of my GE requirements matched up with my major requirements. Comparing UCSD and UCD, I‚Äôve talked to a lot of people, who went to both UCSD and UCD, the general consensus was that UC Davis was the better school for the structural/geo route. A lot of people had the same idea as you where they felt they wasted less time doing unnecessary courses. Don‚Äôt get me wrong UCSD is a good school and if you are given structural engineering as your declared major (not undeclared) then there‚Äôs nothing bad about pursuing it. But again, people I talked to agreed that out of the two, UC Davis was the better school in the Structural engineering/geo route."
