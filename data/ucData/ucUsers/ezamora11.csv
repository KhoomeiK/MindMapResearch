ucr,fpm4gyl,t1_fpm0kux,1588725371.0,Is it an extra 600 weekly?
ucr,fplzuvp,t3_ge5qp7,1588722700.0,"Iâ€™m confused, I applied for unemployment and was told they would only give me 220 weekly, why donâ€™t I get the extra $600?. Also, after getting the award letter in the mail, how soon did you receive your funds?"

ucr,fo4q0ok,t3_g5nlyx,1587509004.0,Where was this announcement made? I didnâ€™t receive anything
ucr,fo4py09,t3_g5jmmo,1587508964.0,"This is dumb because this covid-19 isnâ€™t going to end anytime soon, thereâ€™s even rumors that fall quarter might be online too (which doesnâ€™t affect me) and it takes about 3 months to get the actual diploma in the mail so why would I want to come back for a ceremony if by that point I would have gotten the diploma already and Iâ€™m going to grad school starting in the fall at another school so Iâ€™m not going to stop whatever Iâ€™m doing just to go to a ceremony.   If it the postponement was for July then sure Iâ€™ll be excited, but the excitement is gone after august and later. Commencement feels good when you just finished finals and your done and your celebrated, but Iâ€™ll be over it after the first 2 months lol. And Iâ€™m not mad at the school for this, Iâ€™m mad at the students that opted for this idea. Half the class of 2020 isnâ€™t going to show up so wheres the excitement? We all are on a mission to find jobs and go to grad school afterwards, we donâ€™t have time for this. This is all sad for all of us but thereâ€™s nothing we can do, Iâ€™ve pretty much just accepted reality, give me my diploma, and my diploma book and Iâ€™ll be satisfied . Ok Iâ€™m gonna stop venting now. Love you all"

ucr,fmvab8i,t1_fmv3u6t,1586410467.0,"Yes! All you really need is to pass the cset in social science and cbest and your set! Besides, UCR is so much better!"
ucr,fmv34j3,t3_fxlcs0,1586404888.0,"By human development, are you talking about the BA in education? Yes you can be a teacher in that, it doesnâ€™t have to be in pre school. Every education student wants to be a math teacher, or psych teacher, or history teacher...etc. You can actually major in anything you want to be a teacher. All you have to have is a BA or BS in anything you love, take the CBEST, and then take the CSET in the subject that you want to teach which I believe psychology would fit under the social science subject exam.  The education is degree is actually a great one, itâ€™s my minor and I wish I would have chosen it as my major instead because the professors are amazing. If your interest is in psychology, you can even add psychology as your minor so it can prepare you for the cset exam."

ucr,fmf6yt3,t3_fur6ou,1586021181.0,"I did summer session last year and I loved it. Everyone says it affects your fin aid for the next quarters but thatâ€™s a lie. I took 12 units and I got the same amount of fin aid I get every quarter, and it didnâ€™t affect me at all for the fall/winter and now spring. Go to the UCR summer fin aid application to send the app"
