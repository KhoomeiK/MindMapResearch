dcanimateduniverse,fplu41p,t1_fplos77,1588719505.0,"Yeah it was a bit disappointing. First few minutes of the movie is the league discussing the plan to attack Darkseid, then title intro, flashes forward to after the failed battle. We only get to see glimpses of what happened in flashbacks. On the bright side, we may be getting a reboot ? The movies so far had pretty good action scenes and visuals, but the stories /plots were a bit lackluster if you ask me."
dcanimateduniverse,fpkb6eu,t1_fpk542j,1588691467.0,When he got depowered he fights some league of assassins ninjas briefly. He also uses lex‚Äôs suit when going back to apokolips. The only real fights he has are when Trigon controls his body and fights Darkseid and when he breaks free from Trigon (gains his powers and suit back) and pounds Darkseid. In this one scene Darkseid is about to fire his Omega beams and Superman sticks his thumbs in his eyes and ragdolls him (like Hulk does to Loki ‚Äúpuny god‚Äù. Other than that not really many fights for Supes.
dcanimateduniverse,fpjiv91,t1_fpjc4a4,1588670166.0,"SPOILERS (tbh u shouldnt even click on this thread if its titled spoilers)

I‚Äôll just put in the juicy parts, comment for anything specific u wanna know.

Darkseid has been conquering/destroying worlds.

Superman and the League form a plan to attack Darkseid headon instead of waiting for him to come to Earth.

Darkseid finds out about the plan by spying thru cyborg.

League goes to Apokolips but ambushed by Doomsday-Parademons. 

Aquaman gets bisected by omega beams, WW, mera, martian manhunter, hawkman get mutilated and turned into cyborgs. Batman is brainwashed and becomes darkseids intel guy with the moebius chair. Superman is poisoned by Kryptonite. Constantine runs away when Zatanna is getting eaten (turns out batman had zatanna put a spell on john to make him run away in case the plan failed). Nightwing is killed but damian throws him in the lazarus pit. However he is traumatized and in a straightjacket. Starfire gets bisected (u can see her guts) but is revived as a cyborg for darkseid. Superboy gets his neck snapped by a Paradoom. Shazam gets his right leg eaten (bogus if you ask me, he should be as invulnerable as supes, even if they are doomsday parademons).

John takes the gem off of raven trapping darkseid, trigon kills john (gets revived later by zatanna in heaven, as part of the contingency plan from earlier). Takes over supermans body, proceeds to pound darkseid. (Supertrigon, how cool is that?!)

Lois dies in an explosion from detonating luthors tower to take out the paradoomsdays, superman gets pissed and breaks free. Also from merging with trigon earlier he gains his powers back, but his sideburns are grey (kinda like kingdom come).

Raven and john then do something with trigon (i assume they make a deal with him) and he fights darkseid. Cyborg, who is bound to apokolips sends everyone home and opens a big boom tube to suck darkseid and apokolips into nothingess (trigon drags darkseid in)

In the end, everything is lost, flash runs back in time, and the world is erased.

My thoughts:

Imo plot is meh, but the action is great. Pm me if you want to know anything specific.

Darkseid (classic/pre52) is one of my favorite comic villains, but he was kind of an ass in the movie, I was rooting for Superman/Trigon to spank him. Though i think the film does capture Darkseid‚Äôs ‚ÄúGod of Evil‚Äù shtick very well. All the things he does were truly evil. 

Wonder woman screaming in pain when the paradooms rip her arm off... :((

Imo Darkseid was really only winning at the beginning because of his army of Doomsday Parademons. He doesn‚Äôt really do much other than Omega beam some lanterns/oans on oa and fight trigon/superman at the end. It seemed like Superman‚Äôs really the only being that can handle the Paradooms (in theory Shazam and Manhunter should too but they got massively nerfed). Also where were the other New gods ?!?!

And how tf did darkseid kill the guardians, they should be able to handle him.

Raven reviving damian with her tears was kinda cliche. Power of love?

My favorite quote (SuperTrigon): ‚ÄúSo you are one of the  so-called New Gods, I am unimpressed.‚Äù Shows how powerful trigon really is."

UCSD,fnk7r6b,t1_fnjxqto,1587017546.0,"2.988 overall or in the courses needed to switch? Your overall GPA shouldn‚Äôt matter, just the grades in the required courses. Also the site says 2.5 minimum. But I don‚Äôt think having a 2.5 + guarantees you get a spot, it depends how many people apply and how many spots open. However,bio is a pretty big dept and people come and go all the time so you might have a shot. In fact the site says that in the past quarters, the dept has been able to admit all the students who met the minimum requirements. Here‚Äôs the site with all the info you need.

UCSD,fnh5hxm,t3_g1o5hk,1586955343.0,Definitely very different. Imo 2b was also significantly harder. I got an A in 2a but a C+ in 2b üòÇ. Don‚Äôt sweat it if you don‚Äôt remember 2a material; 2b is something else lol.

gradadmissions,fmum5p2,t3_fxc4z9,1586394117.0,"Imo the increased competitiveness will probably be a result of less funding, more so than increased number of applicants. This probably varies by program, but if you have been preparing for the past 2+ years and get solid letter of recs for program X, you‚Äôre probably gonna beat the 10 applicants who suddenly decided to apply because of the current situation. For sure there would be applicants with outstanding profiles, but they would‚Äôve been applying regardless of CoVID or not.

Only time will tell for sure, but that‚Äôs just what I think."
