nintendo,fom8clr,t3_g7vuf0,1587881322.0,"I’m looking forward to spending time with my friends and family outside of the house! My friends and I have a tradition of getting in one car, driving to Barnes & Noble and walking around the store looking through everything and sitting to grab some tea and cheesecake from their cafe, all while talking about anything and everything. Then we usually head to a restaurant (Thai Jasmine or Wing Stop) and an arcade afterwards. If we are up for it, we stop at a gas station (usually Circle K) and grab some snacks and eat in the parking lot before heading home. With my family, I miss going to the farmers market on weekends!"
