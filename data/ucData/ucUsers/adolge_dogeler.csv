UCSC,fomjhl5,t1_fokow2p,1587892339.0,Yes you‚Äôre wrong. If classes are in person then there‚Äôs a point in staying on campus. If they‚Äôre online there‚Äôs no need to spend thousands of dollars on housing.
UCSC,fokou7a,t1_fokjdoh,1587846114.0,I can‚Äôt spend 4K on housing just cause
UCSC,foizdpb,t1_foh8mvl,1587802359.0,IKR I‚Äôm in 144 rn and I‚Äôm actually having fun in her class. Like she explains the concepts pretty well and I understand a lot through her explanation Idk if it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôve done ML before but she definitely helps in my understanding.
seduction,fo8ht88,t1_fo877nm,1587596827.0,Hey I mean I don‚Äôt think a woman isn‚Äôt attracted to success. He‚Äôd have a 100k job and a 100/100 gal. I‚Äôm a cs student btw and I met my current gf in a cs class

seduction,fmpkne3,t1_fmpjox0,1586282524.0,"1 girl that came onto me and she cheated on her bf with me (I feel bad for this because she was moral-less but I myself should‚Äôve had the morals to stop it). My DJ friend/roommate threw kickbacks a lot of times where we had sorority girls a lot of the times. And needless to say drink girls will come talk to you regardless of who you are and after that, it‚Äôs just you who can steer the convo in the right direction. So I used talk to them and not give a shit, then I moved away from them. I used to pull out my guitar or just go talk to my bros. If they follow you, then jackpot! But if not then it‚Äôs not worth your time. To answer your question 3 using this scenario, but the take away is that I wasn‚Äôt thinking about getting with them. It just sorta happened... anywho then I got into a relationship and I‚Äôm still in it rn. But to give you a perspective: 5 in 3 months"
seduction,fmpja3n,t3_fw93vx,1586281842.0,"Idk how much this counts but I‚Äôm 18 and I won‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the most attractive of the bunch or 6 foot or well... white. Anyways, I got frustrated with my love life (I had some girls in my life but it was hard to keep them). I said well fuck it I‚Äôm gonna be in this body and mind for the next 50-60 years, why not make myself happy. There is no guarantee that I would be happy when I get into another meaningless relationship, if I‚Äôm not happy by myself. So I decided to strap down on my major/classes and did extra reading (also my major is super lame: computer science so not a lot of scope to meet any ladies. This will change later in my story :)). I decided to workout for more than 2 hours everyday for 6days a week. Condition myself to conditioning for wrestling with an emphasis on strength training. I started gaining more knowledge about Quantum physics and math that I like. This happened during summer, so the moment I got back to my school. I had a slender waist with 6 packs showing, pecks popping off my chest and huge shoulders. Pretty much did a 180 on my look which was average looking with a little bit of pudge. I saw that I was just focused on myself and doing my own thing and not even thinking about the ‚Äúgame.‚Äù It went to the level that a girl who had a bf came on to me. So moral of the story: doesn‚Äôt matter how old you are, focus on where you want to be in your life and steer your life in that direction. You‚Äôll see that a change of route can give you... different scenery :)"
