UCSD,foq7fjy,t3_g8q16g,1587985670.0,"IKR this class is super crazy, I honestly wish I could go back in time and make my high school self take physics cause I haven’t been able to retain anything in this class. I end up staring at the homework for hours on end trying to understand it but just end up pulling some math outta my ass cause I ain’t gonna be caught dead cheating. Having to worry about a quiz almost every night is insane too. I just wish energy could be evenly distributed this quarter but if I’m being completely real 85% or my time has gone into this class while 15% has gone to my other classes (one of which is wayyyy more relevant to my major)"

UCSD,fn55k1f,t3_fzljj6,1586656447.0,"I decided to learn the summer before this year started for the same reason and because it seemed like a cool hobby to pick up. It took me a few weeks to learn and be confident in my skills but going back to school made me realize all of the things you gotta be aware of. I would say probably a month or two in I really was able to just weave through the crowds and control myself accordingly, not without a lot of practice and falling ungracefully a few times, but it all depends on how comfortable you are before hand! It's worth all the sweat though so just keep practicing and I wish ya luck!"
UCSD,fmrmibw,t3_fwtowd,1586327868.0,"I sincerely hope not, but it’s too far to tell atm. I feel like even if we all follow self-isolation for the time being, it’s gonna be a slow uphill battle getting everything back to normal again."
UCSD,fmnn6ct,t3_fw7kav,1586230043.0,"Yup, I already have a ton of stuff to catch up on and it feels like no time has passed"
UCSD,fmg61pf,t3_fuwrha,1586042009.0,Yeah it’s overall just really hard to be motivated this quarter
