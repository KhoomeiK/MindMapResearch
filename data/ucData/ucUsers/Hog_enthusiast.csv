frugalmalefashion,fpltor1,t1_fpj35rt,1588719272.0,Mine just came in today too
frugalmalefashion,fphagkb,t1_fph87ka,1588617804.0,I’ll probably do the same thanks
frugalmalefashion,fped4cw,t1_fnr57x8,1588545153.0,any update? Mine shipped around the same time and I haven't received them.
frugalmalefashion,fpeczk0,t3_fmexyo,1588545076.0,mine says shipped April 8th and I still haven't gotten them. Anyone else have a shipping date around that time? Should it be taking over 20 days to ship or are they lost? I didn't spring for the tracking number.

berkeley,fp418tj,t3_g8an1k,1588289701.0,"I’ve noticed this at my university in North Carolina. Really sucks. I had one class where a guy was complaining this girl got an internship “just because she’s a woman” and how he deserves one more than her. I was like bro you got a 39 on the last test maybe that’s why. People really treat the women in this major awful. That’s why there’s so few female software engineers. I think it’s less sexist hiring practices and more the fact that the men in this field are so awful to the women.

Not saying bad hiring practices don’t exist just that I’ve seen women leave the field because classmates and professors tell them they aren’t good enough to stay, even when they are"
AmItheAsshole,fp40sh9,t3_gagmvf,1588289449.0,"NTA. This isn’t a joke it’s just causing someone distress because you find it funny, like what is the joke? Your parents find your distress funny. That’s what they think the joke is. That’s awful. They need to apologize to you immediately"

I feel like “the point” is clear. She doesn’t feel comfortable with her nose and she’s been unhappy because of it for years, you describe that yourself. The chipping in is a show of support it doesn’t have anything to do with money. Your sister is making a tough decision. It’s hard to make a permanent change to your body, even to a part you don’t like. I seriously don’t understand why you wouldn’t support her. Just send a few bucks."
appstate,fob22vi,t1_fo9jm1f,1587655236.0,You could layer up most of the time. Plenty of people bike in colder weather. The main problem is everyone I know who bikes to campus has been hit by a car at least once
appstate,fo8ux9e,t3_g619xf,1587604360.0,"Everyone is saying fix appalcart, but they’re ignoring the fact that most students live within a ten minute bike ride from campus. If the roads were better lit and there were more bike lanes, less people would need to drive or ride the bus. The busses already come every ten minutes, the problem for me is they pass me by because they’re already full. If students biked we wouldn’t have full busses"
Warzone,fo8uj4f,t1_fo7irug,1587604126.0,You need to get the kills with a marksman rifle with a reflex scope
Warzone,fo7cgp2,t3_g63ltu,1587575977.0,"You need to get at least 5 kills in 25 matches, it might only be multiplayer not warzone"

replyallpodcast,fn5nqpw,t3_fz75jq,1586670027.0,HOLY FUCKING SHIT. It was BAT SALIVA think about it. This dude starts telling everyone to eat bat saliva next thing you know BAM
AmItheAsshole,flk9rav,t3_foo3cr,1585236794.0,"ESH she shouldn’t have been rude, and you did come in at an appropriate time, but not tipping her was rude. If you get bad service give a bad tip, like 10%. But waitresses make 2$ an hour. There’s no situation where you shouldn’t tip at all, they need that money."
