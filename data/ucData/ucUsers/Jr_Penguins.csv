UCSantaBarbara,fpjhmb3,t1_fpjgn6b,1588668815.0,Ahh I see. Your best option would be to contact the group you're trying to lease from and explain what's going on. I'm pretty sure they'd accommodate during a time like this since it's practically impossible to get anything notarized right now. I did mine way before covid-19 happened so I'm not sure what other advice I can offer you.
UCSantaBarbara,fpjhatu,t1_fpftu79,1588668468.0,"I will have to somewhat disagree on this comment. I did thorough researching and saw Meridian had bad ratings. But I also researched apartments as an individual and saw that some properties owned by meridian had decent ratings. So I decided to test my luck (I was already late to the housing game and most places were rented out) and lease at the best rated apartment from meridian.

I'm still currently leasing (going into my third year with them) so I can't comment on #1 just yet. #4 is inapplicable for me. #5 is a general thing with all property companies, not just meridian. #2 & #3 though... I have to say this must be subjective to who your apartment manager is and not by meridian themselves because it's the complete opposite at where I'm at.

To #2, parking restrictions are so lax where I'm at that I've actually had to make several complaints to the manager before any towing would happen. And our permits are with those plastic suction stickers so sometimes it naturally falls off and drops to the floor. Never was towed or warned for my permit not being visible when it fell off. To #3, if we had to move our cars for maintenance or whatever they'd let us know where we can temporarily park for the time being. We weren't left to scavenge for a street spot in IV. So I think it all depends on who your manager is. Not so much if you're renting from meridian or not.

I've only had one issue and it was at the very beginning when I placed a security deposit and when I logged into my account the next day it showed I hadn't placed any deposit. I looked at the bank statements and I did pay for the deposit. I lawyered up quickly and they were quick to fix it. No arguments. So overall I have been satisfied with renting from meridian."
UCSantaBarbara,fpjgar8,t3_gdsbjg,1588667410.0,"Yes, I have done it. The company I leased from accepted the guarantor form in person or by online once it has been notarized. Doesn't a notary have to be in person though? I notarized my documents in person at a notary and then scanned it in as a PDF to submit it. The alternative was to hand the notarized document in person or mail it."
UCSantaBarbara,fpc8moe,t3_gb67da,1588491369.0,Mailed mine the second week of April. Have not heard back nor received any refunds according to my credit card company. I'm lowkey worried because I noticed they took off the covid-19 refund info on their website... (At least I can't find it anymore)
UCSantaBarbara,fpc84l2,t3_gbz1xn,1588490855.0,"My TA's quizzes are pretty straight forward. Half is freebie questions about the lab/previous lab and the other half is conceptual ochem stuff.  
For the conceptual ochem stuff, I use the IR & NMR identification chart on the last page of the practice test file on gauchospace & the appendix of the lab manual while I'm taking the quiz. (I hope you know it's open notes fyi)"

UCSantaBarbara,fp1axki,t3_g9xcf4,1588229586.0,"Same position as you (going into my 4th year), though, an out-of-state. Currently paying rent for an unoccupied apartment which is very stupid. My current plan is that regardless of what happens for fall quarter, I'm coming back to either take online classes in IV or attend them in person. Unfortunately don't think I'm getting my job back. (I would obviously quarantine myself for 14 days before integrating myself in campus/public)"
UCSantaBarbara,fp1a6hh,t1_fp093nw,1588228926.0,"Wasn't the reason ProctorU was advised against because video surveillance was deemed creepy? They should just make it a timed exam, some people don't have cameras..."
UCSantaBarbara,fp19hyl,t3_gakxgg,1588228327.0,"Without trying to take any sides (because critical evidence is still lacking on both sides):

Perspective A: A group of ""predator catchers"" supposedly posed as someone underage(?) and attempted to meet up with him at Target. (This is where the youtube video begins) And then they basically interrogate him in the store while filming him threatening him, etc. Note: Question mark is there because this was never indicated to be true or not based on what's provided in the video.

Perspective B: Aldo's fb post claims he was harassed and these people who filmed him twisted his intentions of meeting and their accusations of him were nothing actually discussed in text messages. He said someone created a profile of him on an unknown dating site and made him to look like a predator. The catfish had his phone # so they chatted pretending to be him and then gave Aldo's actual phone # to switch over to texting. So when Aldo received a text message from said stranger to meet up, he didn't know any pretext.

So basically that's what's going on. I'm not taking sides unless more info is put in public. I'm just summarizing what was said in the youtube video & what was said in the fb post (has now been deleted). Both stories has unanswered questions."
UCSantaBarbara,foj5n8f,t1_foj4zku,1587809347.0,"I was paying $50 for a contacts appointment at my hometown so the doubling in price was kinda new for me. But I do not regret it at all. If you cannot pick which optometrist you will see at student health then you really should go to a different clinic. Doesn't have to be from my recommendation. This lady sounds scary after reading all of the student's experiences on here. My bad experience didn't come from the eye clinic, but from the main clinic for the common cold/flu. The doctor was dumb dumb and they ended up scamming me. (In case you were wondering why I dislike student health)"

UCSantaBarbara,foj4kb9,t3_g7k6hk,1587808110.0,"Geller is really sloppy (like super bad with tech) but he understands that and doesn't make us compensate for his errors. He extends sapling, takes out material for us to learn, and gives us multiple choice quizzes. All lectures are pre-recorded so there will not be any real time meeting. I will say that his quizzes are pretty poorly written but they're only 5 questions (10 points ea). They won't be making or breaking your grade. You just gotta set aside time for sapling and you're guaranteed at least a B in the class. So with this all taken into account, I'd rate him a 8/10 as an online professor."
UCSantaBarbara,foj3g4g,t1_fo3zer4,1587806840.0,"Sorry for the slow reply. For me, it was $25 copay for an general eye checkup (when I had bacterial growth).

I think it was a $100 copay (I think, can't remember for sure) for the contacts fitting appointment. Yes, it's a little high for contacts, but they do a really good job. It's a 3 visit series where the doc takes a ""rough"" (but still very accurate) measurement and gives you a sample pair to wear for a week. You come back after, give him your honest thoughts and then he'll decide if he needs to tweak them. If he does need to tweak your contacts, he'll send you on another trial for a week and you come back a third time. Hopefully by the third time you're happy with your prescription trial and then he writes you the actual prescription for your contacts. They do a thorough job making sure you're happy with your contacts. (And you only pay for the first appointment, those returning appointments are part of the initial copay package.)

P.S. If you want to get the exact quotes, you can always call their receptionist and give them your insurance info. They'll run it through and let you know how much you'd have to contribute as copay before you commit an appointment.

P.S.S. Because I really really really dislike student health, I will also throw in that their clinic is less than a 5 minute drive from when you leave Henley Gate. Very close to campus so Uber prices are reasonable if you do not have a car."
UCSantaBarbara,fo2b3zg,t3_g4h334,1587455739.0,"I made comment in your first post, but I thought it may be useful here. Reading these stories makes me never want to go to student health again. Going to post it here too:

""Reading this makes me cringe. As someone who is heavily near sighted, I have to see the eye doctor at least twice a year (check up, infections, contacts, glasses, etc.). Making trips back home is obviously inconvenient and I heard bad things already at the eye clinic (*actually never had good experiences at student health at all, I see a private physician for flu symptoms now*) on campus so I didn't even attempt going there for my eyes. If you have the ability to go outside of campus, I strongly strongly recommend Dr. Luke at **Eye & Vision Care Optometric Group** in Goleta. The receptionist has always been nice, the doctor's assistant (also very very nice) walks you through everything and gives you an option if you don't want your eyes dilated, and the doctor makes an effort to get to know you and has state of the art equipment (some machines I've never seen before lol). To top it all off, the front desk also has complimentary mints. And the wait time is anywhere from 5-20 minutes, never over 30. I actually thought my optometrist in my hometown was the best until I went here, now I made them my primary eye care doctor. So please, save your eyes and go somewhere better. I've experienced bad eye doctors that falsely diagnosed me with things and made it more problematic, please see someone who cares!!!

Side note: I don't know if this clinic takes gaucho insurance (I'm waived)"""
