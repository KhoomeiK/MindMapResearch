berkeley,fpgga8v,t3_gdbppj,1588602112.0,"just took 61A this semester with no prior coding experience. it's hard, for sure, but very rewarding. i think if you're coming in little to no experience you have to be ready to dedicate a lot of time to your classes and stay on top of things; it's very easy to fall behind and once that happens you're fighting a losing battle. don't let the difficult discourage you though, because i think if you take the right steps and build the right habits it's very doable"

berkeley,fotqr2p,t3_g9ie6a,1588062779.0,"i think first you need a general idea of what direction you're hesding in, even if you don't know your major. It'll help you pick classes that overlap as prerequisites for possible majors. For me that meant taking some Math classes, 61A this semester, and Data 8 next semester. And once you develop more of an idea for what you want to do, you can begin making a long term plan for which classes you want to take. I don't think you should be so strict as to know exactly when to take which classes since you need flexibility (like if you want to avoid a professor, a class doesn't fit your schedule, etc)"

MortalKombat,fo8e1p5,t1_fo8dtum,1587594777.0,absolutely not. they need a different reward system but i'm sure they'll figure out a fair way to get people their skins. i think a good way to do it woukd be to actually use the daily challenges to do stuff other than give us in-game currency
berkeley,fo8cuf4,t1_fo8cjya,1587594132.0,I understand that Sahai isn't in the best position either but what really got me was his 'perspective on your time'. I don't know about everyone else but to me it just represented a complete lack of perspective (haha) about the lives of students and what the purpose of college even is for most people

I recommend you make a plan for how you're going to catch, take it step by step, and if you're feeling demotivated, just know that there's less than a month to go before classes are over. I'm sure there's a lot of people going through the very same thing right now (I know I am) so don't forget you're not alone either"

berkeley,fnffu41,t1_fnffhp5,1586907241.0,Depends on how you are with math. I came in math intended (only decided to do cs because of 61A) and itâ€™s the only class Iâ€™m taking in the summer so should be pretty doable for me. Really depends on the person.
berkeley,fnf290s,t3_g1dna5,1586900076.0,"I'm in the same position as you (took 1B/53 though). I'm probably taking 54 over the summer, because I'm not sure I want to risk my declaration GPA by taking a more condensed version of 61B/70 if I'm not even on campus. If you're somebody (like me) that needs OHs, CSM, etc. then maybe just take a couple breadths instead."
berkeley,fnaodjs,t3_g0ngfi,1586800977.0,"I haven't taken EE16A yet, but I'm taking 61A right now. Though 61A is taught primarily in python (with some scheme and SQL at the end), don't underestimate it. It really forces you think deeply about computation and the way they ask you to answer questions (especially on exams) is not super natural. Even for people with experience, it can be challenging."
berkeley,fn9p3yg,t3_g0ekwf,1586780785.0,"attendance is only 10 points, so I wouldn't worry about it."

berkeley,fn0an6l,t3_fy8t4x,1586538458.0,"You can take a sem where you knock out common pre-reqs between ChemE and CS, plus some breadths. I did that when I joined (I wasn't switiching, but it's pretty easy to go from CoC to L&S) and I think it was a really good decision because it's freed me up to take just the minimum amount of units (or one or two more) and focus on rhe classes that matter to me. Even if you don't meet the GPA cap you can just major in DS (which can basically be a CS major with a different moniker if you choose your classes correctly)."

berkeley,fmxtdrd,t3_fy0bt8,1586471498.0,Just woke up to like 6 emails from Wood. That cease and desist one is funny but I don't envy him the task of organising the midterm for such a big class.

Whatever you decide, good luck!"
