UCSD,fo0wl4x,t3_g50qun,1587421130.0,I also got a random charge before. I didn’t get a response the first time and the deadline was coming up to pay so I put “[URGENT]” in the subject line and they replied within a day.
UCSD,fnfgxag,t3_g1frsd,1586907830.0,"Wait the MCWP TAs are saying these things or your classmates? ....That sounds incredibly insensitive and unprofessional on their part.

EDIT: Re-read your post it’s the TAs. Just wow..."
