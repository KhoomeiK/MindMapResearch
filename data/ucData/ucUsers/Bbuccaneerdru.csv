UCDavis,fpih4gj,t1_fpigmad,1588640792.0,God I genuinely hope the person who made this bot gets cancer or aids or corona.
truegaming,fp2rz4b,t3_gar85f,1588266903.0,"Holy shit, another god-awful survey full of obvious bias and academic laziness- and oh, wow what a surprise! It's from some shithole school that nobody has heard of or respects. Why do you academic failures always come to this sub looking for people to do your shitty surveys. YOU ARE NOT ACADEMICS. You're just a bunch of losers in an awful college who aren't smart or creative enough to actually go and design something useful, so you put together your trio of brain cells and wrote some survey that a high school sociology teacher would find academically dishonest. Fuck off with the surveys you fucking loser fucks."
truegaming,fp2r7x3,t1_foz7nif,1588266542.0,"I legitimately hate people like you. You guys are not academics. You're not uncovering any patterns. You created a godawful survey with a clear bias and now you idiots are patting each others backs at your shithole university that nobody's heard of. Get a real degree. You guys aren't even fucking game designers, you're game ""philosophers,"" but your philosophy is full of bias and the smell of your own farts."
truegaming,fp2qsul,t1_fp17tyc,1588266337.0,"Writing in a second language isn't an excuse when they're posting this on an english-language forum. Moreover, this is absolutely ridiculous; these guys aren't even game designers, their game ""philosophers."" My problem with this study is that responses to it legitimize these people's ridiculously stupid ""proffesion."""
truegaming,fp15zas,t3_gabevt,1588225352.0,"Why is it that whenever a survey is posted in this subreddit that survey is horribly worded, full of bias that would render it unscientific, and from a university that nobody has ever heard of?"
GameDeals,fp0l1xw,t3_gadao9,1588211416.0,"Ah, the reddit-certified intellectual gamers game. This game literally made me realize that war was bad."
Femdom,fokpb5p,t3_g5cld6,1587846372.0,Ulysses by James Joyce.
nfl,fogixzl,t1_foge3aq,1587753162.0,They play with a smaller ball and their 3 pt line is closer.

nfl,fodthoo,t1_fodon8b,1587689827.0,That's a flat fucking lie. Whole Foods starts at $15 minimum. I hope you catch Corona from one of them you hyperbolic cunt
UCDavis,fnah2eh,t3_fyo5s4,1586797382.0,"If you couldn't actually raise and support the cat, why did you get a cat? People like you are so incredibly fucking irresponsible. You treated this cat like a toy and now that you're done with your toy, you're going to throw it away to the first taker. I legitimately hope you get fucking Corona, because you are a piece of shit who shouldn't be wasting space on this campus.

Edit: also, yes, you are ugly as fuck. You're ugly on the inside, and you're especially ugly on the outside. Fuck you, you ugly freak, that cat was the only pussy you're ever going to touch. And you're not a filmmaker, retard, you're some ugly asshole who can't take care of a cat. Fuck you."
MorbidReality,fn9b1xx,t1_fn88n9s,1586765984.0,"Sorry dude, this reads like bullshit. If somebody threatens your life to do a crime short of murder, you can use that as an exculpatory defense. Either your brother had the worst lawyer in history or he's lying."
SandersForPresident,fn6ylyt,t1_fn6xsm5,1586709888.0,You are so full of shit dude. What you're doing is no better than what the Russians did for Trump.
SandersForPresident,fn6xf5z,t3_fzv4q4,1586709225.0,"Holy shit, you people are such fucking wannabe victims. The reason this story took time to come out is because it TOOK TIME to get all the information for the story:

 The Times has also interviewed lawyers who spoke to Ms. Reade about her allegation; nearly two dozen people who worked with Mr. Biden during the early 1990s, including many who worked with Ms. Reade; and the other seven women who criticized Mr. Biden last year, to discuss their experiences with him.

This is not a conspiracy against your overlord, it's the Times doing their due diligence."
nfl,fn6v7d2,t1_fn6jh1q,1586707996.0,That year was a fluke.

UCDavis,fmqwb4r,t1_fiyynok,1586308458.0,"Damn, just found this comment. Really makes me despise the TAs at Davis for being such hypocrites."
UCDavis,fmqvlko,t3_fwqcxj,1586308018.0,So did you guys stop asking for a 40% pay increase despite working a part time job?
UCDavis,fmqtn38,t1_fmqq35j,1586306804.0,"What exactly is his fucking problem? His syllabus says ""love what you do, or don't do it,"" and yet he's the smoothbrain running a required MEDIEVAL literature class, which nobody needs or cares about."
UCDavis,fmp7zsd,t3_fw8bx4,1586276125.0,Someone forward this to Matthew Vernon.
