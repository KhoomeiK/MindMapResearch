tumblr,fp1oxlg,t1_foz159t,1588243096.0,"Brazilian public education, at least in my town, is definitely something...lots of good and bad memories. My worst experience tho was from 5th to 7th/8th grade. My friends and a couple of supportive teachers are the reason why I still have good memories associated with it. The problem was that a lot of the adults treated us like shit. I had good grades and was a well behaved child so I didn't get scolded as much as some of the other kids but there were a few teachers and the school supervisor *especially* were complete assholes to everyone even if we weren't doing anything. 

I once got sent to detention for forgetting to do an assignment and the supervisor told me (who was ~11 at the time) that I was a failure and wouldn't amount to anything in my life. Looking back, that's an awful thing to say to anyone, especially a kid. But when you're a kid it is easy to blame yourself instead of questioning an adult. That's how she treated the students all the time. She was awful.

Needless to say, years of this type of stuff stuck with me for a really long time. I still struggle with dealing with failure but things have been improving with time. Moving to a new school environment and eventually coming around to talking to a counselor has helped *a lot*"
tumblr,foyy9vi,t1_foyvzuc,1588181416.0,"Same. I changed schools many times during my lifetime. Some of my experiences have been great, others have been horrible. I'd hate to have to relive the latter. Two decades later and my ability to stand up for myself still hasn't improved much so if I had a do over in the same schools with the same people, I don't think a lot would change"

I guess she isn't comfortable begging for food when it's someone she's not very familiar with. Instead she'll get the attention of someone from the family and then do *the look*. She'll look at us then at the guest's plate, then back at us again like ""please inform the new human over here about how it is house etiquette to feed the family pet"""

There were throw blankets over them which kind of helped but sometimes the blankets would slip off and the pieces of leather sticking out would scratch us.

OnePiece,fn031xw,t1_fmzzo7m,1586534548.0,"Not the person you replied to but anime/manga is pretty popular there, especially one piece, Naruto and dragon ball (at least when I was a kid). São Paulo especially has a large population of Japanese immigrants but anime seems to be popular in a lot of other parts of the country too. I remember watching some animes like dragon ball, inuyasha, sailor moon, Naruto (I think?) and a couple others along with morning cartoons on local channels. I think that's how they became popular all over the place and then as people grew older they moved on to other series as well. I know there are a few conventions but I don't know too much about them because I'm from a smaller town and only really started attending cons once I was a bit older and living in the US. I should actually look into that"
