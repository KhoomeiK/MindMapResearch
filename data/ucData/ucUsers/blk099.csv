UCDavis,foosj0z,t3_g8o6lb,1587945542.0,Transfer student here! I would definitley recommend to go through a juco and then transfer out. A community college is great place to get all your GEs done quickly and will save you a lot of money.

UCDavis,fof62rr,t3_g74tbl,1587727301.0,"If I could go back in time, I would not come to UCD. For me, my problems lie with the school because no one could tell me exactly what my grants would cover or why my financial aid is always being ""reviewed"" (reduced) every week until the last day to pay. Each quarter has been a surprise when it comes to my bill and instead of not reducing my aid they only gave me the option to take out these crazy loans that no one should ever take. 

As a transfer student, I absolutely love the library, the cats, the people that I have gotten the pleasure of meeting and even the quirky heads, but I am disappointed. I came to Davis because I was sold on the income based scholarship that ""covers everything"" and the academic opportunities that came along with attending. Its definitely an added stress that I could do without."

There is not a required time that you need to attend to graduate. As long as you not only fulfill residency, generally 64 upper division courses, your required major coursework and overall 180 units; you can graduate."
