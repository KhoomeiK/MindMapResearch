ucla,fnid04r,t1_fnibhdy,1586977919.0,"Right, and I think they're going to see the results of their argumentation style when the students vote on this referendum. The argument shouldn't have been ""How could you oppose a Black Resource Center?"" Instead, members of USAC should have worked to persuade people that funding a Black Resource Center (among other things) is sufficient justification for raising tuition by $45 per year during a time of sudden and severe economic turmoil.

For the most part, members of USAC have been conflating opposition to the referendum with opposition to the existence of a Black Resource Center. But I know my beliefs, and my beliefs are that it's important to have a Black Resource Center AND that we should fund it without raising the cost of attendance in the midst of a global pandemic. If USAC wants to convince me to vote for this referendum, they're going to have to make an argument that addresses that viewpoint."

ucla,fnh1phw,t1_fngny0v,1586952437.0,"I just hate the false dichotomy they're trying to create -- either you support the referendum or you don't care about minority students' needs. Personally, I think it'd be great to create a Black Resource Center and to create a prayer space for Muslim students, and I'm guessing the vast majority of UCLA students feel the same way. I also think it's wrong to raise tuition by $45 during a time where many students have been thrust into severe economic turmoil (and for those already in economic turmoil, conditions have severely worsened). Obviously, USAC couldn't have possibly foreseen the impact COVID-19 would have on the United States, but that's the reality. The members of USAC leave that out when they're talking about this referendum, and it's so frustrating for them to do that."

Sacramento,fncstkp,t1_fnciia4,1586846058.0,"The Republican Party isn’t comparable to the KKK. The KKK lynches minorities just for existing. The vast majority of Trump supporters oppose that. There’s a reason you’ll often see Trump fans trying to link the KKK to the modern Democratic Party: they hate the KKK and understand why they’re evil, just like most American voters across the aisle do.

I don’t think the mayor needed to resign for this; posting a “Trump supporters = KKK” meme shouldn’t be career ending. I think he should have admitted the meme was stupid and moved on. To be clear, Trump does a lot of stupid shit that deserves harsh and blunt criticism, but it’s simply ridiculous to act as if most Trump fans are equivalent to the KKK. Calling people snowflakes or saying that the mayor is “telling it like it is” won’t change that."

TheStrokes,fnbup8v,t3_g0sg61,1586822690.0,"I'll be honest, I didn't have high hopes for this album at first. I didn't give The Adults Are Talking a full listen, but from the intro riff I had (incorrectly) assumed the Strokes were going in the direction of ""let's remake Is This It/Room on Fire"" (great albums, but I like that the Strokes aren't stuck in the past). Then At the Door came out, and while it was clear that they weren't trying to replicate their first two albums, I didn't really get it at first. Fortunately, all of my negative impressions about the album were wrong, and the album just blew me away on my first listen. Every single song on it is great. I think it beats Comedown Machine for my favorite Strokes record.

In short, I have high hopes for the 2020s, at least as far as the Strokes' music goes."

TheStrokes,fn2p6ia,t3_fz0xxf,1586597672.0,"Didn't notice that on my own, but I hear it. That's pretty cool!

I wouldn't be surprised if that's intentional. Julian seems to have taken a liking for reusing past elements of songs over the past few years. The most conspicuous example of this is that The Voidz's One of the Ones reuses a riff from Dare I Care (with only a difference in rhythm distinguishing the two riffs). And then there's all the lyric-sharing and song references in Virtue (Bad Decisions even references Leave It in My Dreams). Even on this album, a lot of the songs from At the Door onward reference doors.

Another example is that the chorus of Permanent High School which sounds like part of the Drag Queen outro, although I can't say for sure that that's intentional."
