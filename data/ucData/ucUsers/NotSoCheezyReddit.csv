Back in high school, a friend of mine who was in great shape failed the BMI and Flexibility portions of the fitness exam and had to continue taking PE early in the morning despite a mile time less than a third of mine. Meanwhile, my chubby ass got out of it no problem and didn't have to wake up at 5:30 every morning for 3 years."

Futurology,fmq8ydr,t1_fmq2umr,1586295108.0,"How do you define value?

Say there's Person A with very little value and Person B with immense value. To simplify the example, these are the only two humans in existence.

If, one dies, what happens to the value of the other? This ""value"" as a concept only relates to humans. If there's only one human, their value is relative only to themself. So how would you measure it? If Person A remains and does nothing but eat stale Cheetos on a post-apocalyptic couch, they are satisfied in meeting their needs. If Person B remains and builds a statue of themselves with no one to see it, they are likewise meeting their own needs. In either scenario, the last human on Earth is satisfied with their value. By what metric is one better than the other when they will both die and leave no one behind to see what they have and have not done?

Person B cannot have more value than Person A unless Person A exists to observe that value. Therefore, Person A contributes the same net gain of ""value"" from existing as Person B.

Of course value doesn't mean a damn thing on its own. The full phrase is ""value to society,"" and we can measure that in loads of ways but by observing it we change it. If someone is statistically likely to fail and is assumed be a failure before they even try, they probably will fail because nobody gave them a chance to produce more value to society."
Futurology,fmo0ho6,t1_fmnvwfq,1586241004.0,"If humans don't have value, nothing does. ""Value"" is a fundamentally human concept. The universe doesn't care if we all live or die.

If you reject humans having value, you must reject value as a construct. The economy is no more than a collection of human acts."
