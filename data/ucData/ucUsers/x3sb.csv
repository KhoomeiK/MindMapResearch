Irregular bleeding is a very common thing on the pill, so bleeding doesn’t always mean you’re pregnant but it also doesn’t mean you’re not pregnant. It all comes down to if you’ve been on time with taking all your pills & haven’t missed one, then it is safe to assume you aren’t pregnant."

AskWomen,fpjh6lj,t3_gds1pi,1588668344.0,"Stop being nice to them. In fact if you just stop talking to them all together they’ll back the fuck off. Just keep in mind if these people are your friends & they’re toxic, they’re gonna be just as, if not more, toxic once you cut them out. From my personal experience, when I had cut some friends off due to their immaturity & toxicity, that was the opportunity for them to really show how they felt about me, & spoke badly about me & flipped the story to make it seem like I was the bad friend for cutting them off. This is when I realized that cutting toxic people off isn’t the hard part, it’s how that toxicity still may stick with you even when you think you’re done with it."

birthcontrol,fpjg0ik,t3_gdsda3,1588667113.0,"Bleeding isn’t really a indication of whether you’re pregnant or not. Withdrawal bleeding from taking an inactive pill doesn’t necessarily mean you’re not pregnant, the bleeding occurs during a drop in hormones, but isn’t a “real” period if you’ve been on the pill for a while now. & Bleeding doesn’t always happen when you take inactive pills. And if you’ve taken several pregnancy tests & they’ve turned out negative each time I think it’s unlikely that you are pregnant, but of course taking one more test will be your best bet to fully ease your mind. Any concerns you have with irregularities such as the unusual discharge is definitely something to ask your doc about!"
ONETREEHILL,fpjfnoe,t1_fpjfbbe,1588666744.0,Well yeah. All the characters do experience a lot of hurt. Just bc I’m acknowledging her suffering doesn’t mean I think she suffered “more” than the other characters. I just personally liked Brooke’s character & wanted to see her happy more.

I don’t want to spoil anything for you if you haven’t watched it yet but there’s a particular encounter between Brooke & a returning character in S9 & it’s actually so unnecessary & disturbing & I wish the writers would’ve just left that part out. it did nothing for the storyline besides make Brooke suffer one last time before ending the series lol

UCSC,fos1eko,t3_g95xde,1588022216.0,"It’s not necessarily bad, it’s just not recommended. Here’s what I got from the UCSC Econ department website:


“All classes included for major qualification determination must be taken for a letter grade. However, the Economics Department allows all other major requirements to be taken Pass/No Pass. We highly recommend no more than two in the major be taken as P/NP because graduate schools would want to see letter grades in most major-related coursework. Overall, no more than 25% of all classes can be taken as P/NP. It is not recommended to take ECON 100A, 100B or 113 P/NP.”

You should be good to take that class as P/NP, I can imagine it would only look bad if you plan to apply for grad schools but I’m sure they would take the pandemic into considerations when looking at grades for this year."

Just pack smaller bowls so you can kill the bowl & inhale everything more easily & there’s not smoke just lingering in your room. Exhale out the window. Have you tried making a sploof with a toilet paper roll & some dryer sheets? Exhale out of that & you’re solid. If you’re afraid of any smell lingering at all you should get some Ozium!!!!

When you’re nearing the last of your wax, the pod does start to taste burnt. Even if there still is a good amount of wax in there that will get you high, it may hurt bc of the burnt feeling/taste.

Normally I don’t care to listen or conform to any of that but I feel like when you’re constantly exposed to such toxic mindsets all the time, you’re bound to kind of subconsciously move toward having the same mindset... it really messed with my self-esteem & made me into an insecure mess that I’m NOT when I’m not consumed by socia media... needless to say I’ve deleted Twitter.

fitmeals,fnrrun6,t3_g3inci,1587199189.0,"I’m currently bulking & my go-to shake/smoothie recipes for breakfast are:

Chocolate Chip Banana Shake
• 1 cup whole milk
• 1/2 cup oats
• 1 scoop chocolate protein powder
• 2 tbsp peanut butter
• 1 tbsp olive oil
• 1 tbsp honey
• 1 tbsp chocolate chips
• 2 frozen bananas

Tropical Green Smoothie:
• 1 cup orange juice
• 1/2 cup oats
• 3 oz Greek yogurt
• 1 scoop vanilla protein powder
• 5 oz frozen strawberries
• 5 oz frozen pineapples
• 40g spinach
• 1 frozen banana
• 1 tbsp olive oil
• 2 tbsp honey

If you want it to be more filling you can top them off with some granola & fresh fruits & eat it like a smoothie bowl! I also like to freeze fruits instead of using ice, keeps the smoothie nice & thick & is also a good way to save fruits that are about to go bad. 

Of course adjust recipes to your dietary needs/preferences, but this is currently what I’m drinking for breakfast to gain weight/muscle. I struggle with having an appetite so using these shakes are a good kickstart to getting my calories in."

But I also said that we should be more aware of & more sensitive to it bc it IS a much bigger issue than just making over sims. And also just bc someone doesn’t verbally recognize they’re being colorist, doesn’t make it *not* colorist. Bc as I said, it’s usually *internalized* colorism, meaning it’s usually underlying & subconscious, especially if it was learned over time & if that person was surrounded by colorism they’re entire life. 

And you’re right ppl probably would say
*”I don’t care I just like to redo things my way”* Of course they would say they don’t care, especially if they don’t care to educate themselves. 

I’m just trying to bring some perspective into this discussion, because it seems like you have a lot of room for learning.

Definitely shows internalized colorism. If someone makes over a Sim and makes their skin lighter, it kind of implies that they think the Sim looks “better” with lighter skin, which is a deeper rooted issue than just wanting to give your Sim a makeover. if someone is truly upset about the “skin bleaching” aspect, we should be a little more sensitive to that & understand why one may be upset about skin bleaching on Sims!
