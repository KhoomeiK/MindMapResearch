UCSD,fn5ce2u,t3_fzljj6,1586661232.0,"I’ve learned how to skate on campus three months ago. My biggest tip is to learn how to brake cause there’s a lot of steep hills on campus. Once I’ve got used to the basics, I got comfortable with waiving through people but I don’t do it often during peak times cause it’s almost impossible. I usually pick up my skateboard and walk through crowds until I get a bit of space."

UCSD,fk3iyrt,t1_fk388wy,1583835747.0,But what if I have a lab I have to attended? Does that count as a physical course? It’d be really shitty to go back home and take online classes with a huge time difference
