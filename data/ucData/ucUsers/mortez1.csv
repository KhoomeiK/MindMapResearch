pelotoncycle,fpla7iv,t1_fpl65b6,1588709095.0,"I don’t mind the bike ones either (on demand) now that they have the target metrics on screen. I’ve gotten really good at drowning out the instructor unless they are giving real biking advice or instruction. It wasn’t the shout outs that annoyed me first and caused me to drown stuff out. It was some of the instructors “self-promotion” (their spirit, theory, whatever you want to call their “style”) that caused me to eye roll and kinda pay less attention to the bullshit."

virtualreality,fphxb26,t3_gdf8pn,1588629528.0,Forbes is one of the worst online media platforms around these days. They don’t sell news they sell headlines regardless of accuracy.

MMORPG,fp4hrf2,t1_fp4e6u0,1588299329.0,"Yup, exactly! And EQ was extremely social so not only were you twisting you had to chat (through typing, not voice!) at the same time. I still credit my super fast typing skills to playing a bard from 99-02"
UCSantaBarbara,fp2w96b,t1_fp2h0nt,1588268937.0,I dunno... if it states specifically not to use any online resources then no.  If they copy pasted an answer from an online site directly onto a test then I kinda think they deserve it. At least paraphrase or something!
UCSantaBarbara,fp2v09y,t1_fp2cbk7,1588268342.0,"Not even limited to just test taking skills. This will sound mean but, welcome to the real world! Personally, I think this is a great transition from an environment where you know a “perfect” answer exists to a more realistic scenario where the answer might not exist at all. Knowing where to best put your time (a risk vs reward type deal) is a very valuable skill in real world scenarios."
ethtrader,fou6zxt,t1_fotzazj,1588077821.0,They can’t read. I’m assuming they didn’t realize it said “mined ETH in 2020” and just thought they own 48% of all ETH.

mensgrooming,fook44u,t3_g8gweh,1587940552.0,The clippers aren’t that good then. Sounds like he will need higher quality clippers that have been taken care of. I’ve personally burned through multiple clippers doing at home haircuts in my time and I have thick Hispanic hair as well
ethereum,fohcznn,t1_foh5dyf,1587763897.0,"But your comments aren’t helping matters. You are relating yourself to a police officer but in reality you would be the police officer that doesn’t actually prevent crime but simply mocks someone you deem a criminal simply because they have a differing opinion than you.

I’m not debating ethereum with you because your behavior is confusing. Your sense of superiority and denial reminds me of those with addiction and/or rage issues.

Do you honestly think you’re changing anyone’s mindset here simply by yelling ‘SCAM’ in all caps all the time?"
ethereum,foh3dxm,t1_fogqy35,1587760077.0,Why are you here then bashing something you claim is a scam? Your behavior more closely resembles those that feel threatened and powerless.
ethereum,foh25ln,t1_foguqhu,1587759672.0,What? How did you get there from what he said? He makes perfect sense and I have no idea what point you’re trying to make. Are *you* claiming the internet is basically porn and marketing? Are you claiming *he* is making that claim?
pelotoncycle,focta7t,t1_foco6u5,1587675552.0,I’m sure the benefit of being able to claim they have X number of rides to select from far out ways a few TBs of storage space. Are you kidding?

everquest,fn0k5k8,t3_fykltc,1586543424.0,"I played a bard from release for like 3-4 years. Loved it! I’ve gone back and tried P99 and some free servers here and there and maybe got to 20s before stopping.

My question: what should I do?? Lol

My main issue is time, I just can’t dedicate the time to playing as much as I could back then. Right now I kinda can though with our current global situation.  Sounds like Mangler is where to go. I loved playing the bard but they were so reliant on groups, is that still the case? My other thought was wizard or Druid or just straight up Cleric because I really do love grouping!

I don’t mind spending a little money but have no idea what the packages they are referring to in the link. Is there a good bang for your back starter kit anyone can recommend?

Thanks for any suggestions for my wildly random and vague questions :)"
AlaskaAirlines,fmsxtvh,t3_fx8wig,1586363686.0,Can you rebook something and then request cash refund? Or will it only go to the form of payment which was a credit?

ShadowPC,fmllef7,t1_fml3s8j,1586188681.0,Are you using the new beta client for VD? He posted it a week or two ago. The new beta client (have to manually side load the apk and download the windows client from the beta site) is even better... it’s incredible. I was using the standard when I first started playing Alyx and it was great... then updated to the beta VD client and it was perfect!
