ucla,fn0q29j,t3_fxy4rl,1586546584.0,Listen guys let’s be honest here USAC is raising the price on there fees why do you think they are. You complainers man. All UCLA students is complain and protest like do you really think that shit is gone fix a damn thing. You guys want lower housing costs if not free housing lower laundry machine costs. Like damn I want a mansion on Malibu beach surrounded by black water ops with a damn top of the line car for free to but it ain’t gonna happen. Listen guys 15$ more a quarter for a total of what a little less than 300$ a year will not FUCKING kill you. I don’t wanna Pay fees either pero también NO MAMEN. Fucking whiners life ain’t fucking free welcome to the real world where life costs you an arm and a freaking leg where one trip to the ER costs about 15K just for the ambulance. Listen stop complaining like geez what do you expect with a multi million dollar school like UCLA. College costs money and if it doesn’t come out of this it’ll come out from somewhere else. The schools and the government ALWAYS get the money owed to them. Just like the IRS they will always get it back. So stop complaining and pay the 15 damn dollars every quarter. You can afford to not drink coffee for 3 fucking days.
