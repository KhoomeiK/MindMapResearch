I'm not going to stop voting but it just doesn't feel like it does anything anymore. Lobbying means many of our **elected representatives** are willing to sell out, sometimes for pathetically small amounts of money, their constituents. Many often respond to that by saying ""but then they won't get reelected"" but how often does that actually happen? I'm genuinely curious and I don't know where to look into that. It always feels like there are people who have disproportionate amounts of influence like Mitch McConnell or Fox News with how much they talk to The President.

~~~

I used to think the idea of a revolution was just a joke but the system has begun to spiral out of control and isn't going to stop anytime soon because of how rampant corruption is. Seriously though, how do you win a game where a bunch of people are cheating? How do you play it properly without sacrificing your principles while the cheaters are not only breaking the rules but rewriting them entirely to benefit themsel:es? The closest thing I've seen for something like this is the police force. Police are individuals who are given special powers not afforded to your average citizen as these powers may assist in suppressing potentially dangerous individuals. But how are we supposed to implement something like that at the highest levels of government where regulatory bodies can be ""captured"" or shut down entirely? Not to mention how risky it is to give any special powers to any group of people as power corrupts and is too easy to abuse.

~~~

Not to mention how much faith I feel like I have lost in my fellow Americans. And I don't mean it like that stupid ""faith in humanity"" meme. I can't believe Trump has any base left at all but I'm appalled that he was able to manipulate so many people in the first place. Is he a moron? Is he a genius? Is he both? I don't know! But what I do now is he's a terrible person, and somehow millions of people were still willing to back him. I've heard so many reasons for why that is too. People are disenfranchised, they're tired of being called racist, they're uneducated, they believed his lies, they like to have an excuse to feel better than others or look down on others, they like not requiring accountability, etc. To be clear, contextually-speaking these were isolated comments so every single one didn't apply to every single person but there was so much and it really doesn't matter anymore. The idea that a degenerate human being like Trump, an emotionally, temperamentally, logically, and morally reprehensible individual like Trump was able to become president is **incredibly concerning**. In theory, we could fix all of the logistical problems that plague the structural system but what do you do about human nature? We aren't as logical as we want to believe we are. We are certainly *capable* of it but that does not mean we are actually going to be utilizing that skill at all times and it definitely does not guarantee that an individual would have developed the skill to a reasonable extent in the first place.

~~~

Conflicts of interest are supposed to be taken into account but now it seems like everyone has their hand in the cookie jar but there's this weird extra level of mockery (for lack of a better) and rejection of anyone who doesn't have their hand in the cookie jar but no one is supposed to acknowledge it or do anything about it because they're happy that they can keep their hands in it.

~~~

People are too easily manipulated, there's too much misinformation, there's a ridiculous amount of corruption running rampant throughout every aspect of the government, the people are complacent or even complicit to an extent, no one wants to acknowledge the difficult truths, no one wants to take the hard way because it feels like it's not worth it and due to the busted system it might not be, and no one wants to or needs to be honest about anything anymore.

~~~

I just want to live a simple life. I'll admit, I've never been exceptionally passionate about money. My old boss once asked me how many tickets I bought (regarding the lotto when it was at ~$1.7 billion) and I told him I didn't get any. Not because I'm ""above it"" or any nonsense like that, I just didn't get the appeal. If it was a free raffle then sure, why not? But I could use that dollar (or however much a lottery ticket costs) for a donut or something. Maybe it's a short-term happiness kind of thing but it's guaranteed. I'm a big believer in investing for future happiness but not gambling for the possibility of it.

~~~

I've been trying to find simple truths(?) to live by and one of the ones I've been focusing on is ""if something is difficult and meaningful, then it's most likely worth the right option"". I don't know how accurate that is but I want to believe in it. The problem is even if it's an absolute truth, that doesn't make it worth it for everyone and that's oddly concerning to me.  
This section is weirder because I've had this thought bumping around my noodle for a while and I haven't been able to figure out what to do with it. It doesn't feel complete and I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing major components to properly understand it so maybe someone can enlighten me.

I don't know how much truth there is to any of this but these are my thoughts and feelings regarding our society. If you want to chat, feel free to message me. I'd prefer a private message because I'm not a huge fan of group conversations as they feel more tribal and less constrictive but that is also more of an in-person thing to be fair so if you just want to comment then others will be able to participate (I'm not trying to stifle that).

Be good, do good, feel good.

Have a wonderful day :)"
