Why? Dracula as a vampire is a sexual metaphor, and it becomes more apparent the deeper you look. He gets some schlub (Jonathan, played by Keanu) showing up at his place and finds that his girl looks like his old lady that bit it a while back. This puts the fire back into Ol' Vlad's life and he endeavors to steal his woman.  
ALL the dialogue FROM Mina (played by Winona) paints her opinion of him as bland and 'quite droll'... she's bored with him.  
You're supposed to be unimpressed by Jonathan. He's simply a well-to-do worker (not an aristocrat, fully) and not designed to impress, unlike ALL of Lucy's suitors...
