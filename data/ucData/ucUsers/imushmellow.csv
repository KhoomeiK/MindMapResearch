Sounds like you had a blast and were lucky enough to have lots of positive experiences. Kinda wish I knew that side of IV, but shit happens. Thanks for being so polite about it :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fpkxcry,t1_fphmpso,1588702672.0,"Never said I stayed home all day but there are fun alternatives to party jumping. I heard and saw the negatives really early, but everyone has a different experience. You can still party. I'm not anti-fun if it wasn't clear before.

If you really wanna drink and whatnot, you can throw your own party with people you know and keep it private or go clubbing on State Street (of course with above safety measures and always always in a group especially if you're a girl). 

If you have a special event and have willing participants there's something called a landshark that takes you on a tour of downtown. Essentially it's a bring your own drink party bus that is half tram half boat. 

Tons of fun things are part of the UCSB lifestyle, it can be more diverse than getting wasted every weekend. I only said it like I did above vaguely but a friend of mine really let loose and developed major health issues and failed out of their major when they couldn't control how fun it was for them. It was easiest for them to get access to alcohol by hopping parties that were lenient on letting people in as freshman or bragged about how they joined in when people were too drunk to care.This was during their freshman year and it continued into their senior year and it honestly was hard to watch. Many people have a good time and practice safety, but not everyone has self control when they're getting into the vibe of the party and intoxicated."

UCSantaBarbara,fpgwvcb,t1_fpgqfcs,1588610952.0,"I lived in IV 3 out of 4 years lol. I just never went out to house parties because I knew it wasn't for me. Hell I lived on Sabado for a bit and even woke up to people dancing on the roof of my room once while shotgunning beers(they were kinda rude when we asked them to get off too, damn drunks). I still had fun with people I knew, but the idea of getting drunk and walking around town seems kind of dangerous. In addition, I met a few girls freshman year who had bad experiences with groping and whatnot plus we were sent so many sexual assault emails, so yeah I wasn't interested after that."
JapaneseFood,fpfz1h8,t1_fpfyt2l,1588588826.0,I was wondering if covering it would affect the steam and therefore the cook of it.
JapaneseFood,fpfxzty,t1_fpfn5qe,1588587745.0,Is it necessary to cover with food safe wrap or could I leave it open air?
UCSantaBarbara,fpfxl0n,t1_fpey9xn,1588587323.0,"I graduated and am now in La Jolla and can confirm UC socially dead. At least for STEM, there's a few of labs that have undergrads working insane hours for their projects and generally have that insane work ethic vibing. For example, I know of some personally who go in on weekends."
UCSantaBarbara,fpfx714,t1_fpfktvu,1588586905.0,"I never went to a party either, but it's just because I never felt the need to go hop houses for a party. I heard the stories of freshman parade on DP and yeah didn't sound amazing when your roommates came back. As a freshman it was especially bad you lived in Chi 5 dorms: it's a 2 mile round trip walk to even get to the beginning of DP and back to your dorm. Sounded like too much effort to get wasted when you could just chill with your homies instead. You can still drink and have a good time without the party scene.

Edit: I say walk bc you don't exactly want to bike or drive back drunk. Not to mention your bike will get stolen if you leave it and there's absolutely no parking lol"

UCSantaBarbara,fpat9h8,t1_fparsoj,1588455241.0,"From what I remember, the TAs take each other's quizzes to see if it's doable too. I'm sorry to hear that it's going terribly this quarter, maybe they're not checking as thoroughly :("
Mcat,fpashta,t1_fpajegf,1588454785.0,"There's a blurb in the physics/math Kaplan Ch 10 ( basic math) about rounding up/rounding down trends. Seems like you're on an earlier chapter, but it does tell you how to approach it at the end. No idea why they ordered it like that."
Mcat,fpas6h7,t3_gcdpib,1588454596.0,"I was May 29 and it said in the email that it was based on regional guidelines. So if your state is in lockdown, then it's probably cancelled. Still, you should call and ask if you haven't gotten an email."
UCSantaBarbara,fpaqeis,t1_fpaeskz,1588453545.0,I thought the TAs wrote the quizzes? Or is that just 6BL?
California_Politics,fp1jabc,t1_fp1cg0o,1588237434.0,"When I was thinking about that, I was considering that the Chancellors in the UC system make an enormous amount. Techically they are administration, but they could also be teaching. You're right to say that it doesn't mostly go to teaching!"
California_Politics,fp1bzmz,t1_fp18qmt,1588230528.0,"That's another issue, but we still pay staff for working admin duties. The dean of each department still does their paperwork to keep it running and subsequently office workers and advisors. The issue is direct fees for unused/unrelated campus based activities."
California_Politics,fox22t0,t1_fowdu4n,1588132237.0,"Professors are still teaching. When paying for tuition, I would think that a majority of it goes towards paying experts in their respective fields to share that expertise, which they continue to do.

Edit: I think I am wrong for saying a majority of it goes to tuition as universities may pay administrative staff more as it is mentioned in a later comment."
California_Politics,fowa4ib,t1_fow72sq,1588115846.0,"Mainly student fees. For example, UC San Diego has charged students for spring quarter up to $1000 for campus facilities that they do not have access to.

recipes,fmrww1x,t3_fn8qy4,1586338462.0,"Since the original recipe only works with instant coffee, would using a matcha power mix, like ito-en sweet matcha mix, work? It's much less dense and is basically instant green tea. The reasoning for instant coffee has something to do with the dried crystal structure right?"
