I worked at a sandwich place and literally would eat 4 sandwiches a day and take one home and was working 30-40 hour weeks for like 4 months. You may have a stickler boss though. If you actually have some money set aside I’d say 1k> then you could also get into stocks, I’ve done long term holding, options, swing trading. Had varying success with all of them."

ucr,fn8wlfr,t1_fn8uvxg,1586752216.0,"That’s good that you’re hesitant, and while you may feel like a prude, nearly all of those other people are doing it because they “want to get it over with” and are just trying to attain what is sold to them as the best experiences, which if you’re not careful will lead you down a bad path. And not to sound like an after school special, but it’s best to do things at your own pace and when you feel it’s right, and to not feel pressured because that takes all the fun out of doing illegal things.

Definitely don’t get caught up in that shit, FOMO is a disease, focus on your life and career, then when you have a stable life get lit every day of the week and a paycheck rather than throwing away education and most likely not doing too well in classes."
