UCSD,fmxyl5b,t3_fxlnkq,1586474444.0,"If you are currently enrolled then you need to withdraw to drop your classes. The deadline to do so and get a full refund was the first day of classes. AT this point you will not get much money back. You can view the refund schedule here: [https://students.ucsd.edu/finances/fees/registration/schedule-of-refunds.html](https://students.ucsd.edu/finances/fees/registration/schedule-of-refunds.html) 

Refunds are calendar days, not school days."
