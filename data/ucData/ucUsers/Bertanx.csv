So the ones who do have the time for this or make the time for this, tend to be either students with big ""woke"" egos, North Campus majors, and in many cases, both..."
ucla,fph0nbg,t1_fpgc7tx,1588612876.0,Well said. Especially about the faux woke BS and fiscally irresponsible behavior.

The topic was about US involvement in WW2, which was something I was comfortable with, so I did it happily. Never thought it was inappropriate."

ucla,fn0fnpa,t1_fn08415,1586541070.0,"As the other user said, a bunch of professors are just posting their recorded lectures from 2-3 years ago and only doing office hours and replying to emails. It makes no sense for these classes to cost as much as the past quarters. 

Also, there are a lot of lab classes that have to buy and replace equipment every quarter. Since there are no physical labs with physically used components, those costs are gone. This should be reflected in the tuition."
LosAngeles,fmxb3gn,t1_fmxa4sl,1586461731.0,Makes sense. Thanks.
LosAngeles,fmx9m3q,t1_fmdbtye,1586460964.0,Do the waiving of late fees apply to non-RSO units as well?
mountandblade,fm5jpda,t1_fm5idwf,1585774219.0,I am still crashing when trying to load a save. Sent the crash log using the built-in tool so hopefully it helps.
