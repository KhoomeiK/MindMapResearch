NoStupidQuestions,fpm788g,t1_fpm6i8g,1588726979.0,"Well, you have to do it all in your head. Writing down anything would be an immediate red flag, which is why you use a simplified counting system instead of keeping a list of each card that came out. If you had that full list you could actually bet with much better accuracy, but nobody can keep that many things in their head. With a counting system, you only keep one number in your head at a time; you just add to it or subtract from it when you see a new card. 

I think they have a number of ways to catch people. The movie *21* shows a casino having a whole team of people watching players through cameras and using AI systems to predict when somebody is counting. I'm not sure how accurate any of that is, though. I'm sure that big casinos are willing to invest in stopping card counters though, since counting cards has the potential to cause pretty massive losses if the casino can't stop it. I wouldn't be surprised if dealers were keeping a count as well so that they'll notice if somebody only makes big bets when the count is high. They don't need proof, though; they're private establishments and can kick anyone off the tables at any time."
NoStupidQuestions,fpm63bw,t1_fpm4xpj,1588726321.0,"In the game of blackjack, the house (the casino) has a slight edge, meaning that their expected winnings on any game is slightly positive. So, while a single player may win and lose a roughly equal amount (so they stay at the table), the slight advantage adds up over many games and the casino makes money. 

However, the likelihood of the player winning depends on what cards are left in the deck. While it's difficult to track exactly which cards have already been used, there exist counting systems to get a rough idea of what's in the deck. Whenever you see a card come out of the deck (whether it's for you, the dealer, or another player), you add or subtract some number from a running total. The number you add or subtract depends on what the card is and what counting system you use. 

The idea is that the total count at any given time gives you a rough idea of how likely you are to win the next hand. So, you bet more on hands when the count shows that you're more likely to win. This system moves the edge to your side - if you're counting cards, *your* expected payout becomes positive and the casino's becomes negative. So if you play a bunch of hands while counting cards and betting appropriately, you will win more than you lose on average. 

Naturally, casinos don't like this and will usually kick you out (or at least kick you off of the blackjack tables) if you're caught."

LifeProTips,fnb67n2,t1_fnb5b46,1586809922.0,"From now through September, there's no interest rate on student loans. So say you want to pay off $500 of loans right now. Usually, it's better to pay it off sooner because interest is charged as a percentage of the amount of money left to pay off. So if you pay right now, then the next time interest is charged you don't have to pay interest on that $500 because you no longer owe the $500. 

Right now, you actually don't benefit from paying sooner because they won't charge interest until September. So if you just wait until September to pay what you were going to pay right now, you would essentially get an interest-free loan of $500.

worldnews,fn43hay,t1_fn415v9,1586633299.0,"Do you have a source on Republicans proposing removing a ban on Ozone-depleting chemicals? The US banned the stuff that China is pumping out back in the '80s and we seem to be getting along fine, so I'm confused as to why anyone is proposing that they make a comeback. Is there a particular application of those chemicals that would make production of something cheaper? Or are you just making the association ""GOP = destroy the environment"" and there's not actually a push for such chemicals?

Edit: so I'm getting downvoted, but does anybody actually have a source on this? If you're downvoting I would assume you know something I don't about this, and I'd really like to read more about it if you'd be willing to share. I don't live under a rock and am therefore aware that most Republican lawmakers don't care about protecting the environment; I'm wondering if there has actually been any talk of rolling back the specific bans on Ozone-depleting chemicals"
recipes,fn3zqen,t1_fn3wac6,1586631130.0,"Lmao sucks for you, ""Hank"" spent years tracking down the best enchilada recipe and he shared it with the world. But instead you got your recipe from ""Steve"", who goes by ""Marcos"" on recipe blogs so ignorant people like yourself can jerk themselves off to how ""authentic"" their shitty enchiladas are"
recipes,fn3zeq9,t3_fzbihv,1586630943.0,"I don't get why people are so snotty about this kind of shit, and no, it doesn't really belong here. How do you know where where somebody got their recipe? Why can't The New York Times, with their army of investigative journalists, find a decent recipe? People are so quick to judge people who make food just based on appearance, when for all you know the NYT got their recipe from the type of lady that's described here. 

I see it all the time with restaurants, and even the top comment has the same sentiment: ""no Hank, I don't want want your enchilada recipe because it's impossible to experience other cultures and learn from them, so I'd rather sit and eat enchiladas made by Mexico's worst cook than even think about letting a person with a white name make my food."" 

It kind of makes you look like a clown to judge the quality of a recipe or restaurant based on the skin color, name, or location of the chef. For example, there are two popular Mexican restaurants in my town and one of them is generally considered better (better reviews by far, more popular, actual seasoning in the food). The other one is owned by a Mexican guy named Jose who has visited Mexico exactly once, when he was a small child. Jose is a nice guy, but to be honest the food is about as Mexican as Taco Bell. Not bad, but there's more cheese sauce than seasoning if know what I mean. I know a solid number of people who refuse to go to the other restaurant, solely because that restaurant is owned by a white guy, and his (white-sounding) name is in the name of the restaurant. I have heard, from more than one person, that Jose's restaurant is ""more authentic"" just because the dude is Hispanic. Since this became a point of argument in my friend group, I once asked the white guy where he learned to cook. He said he that after high school he moved to Mexico and worked at a restaurant for about five years before going to culinary school in Mexico, and eventually giving up on ""finer foods"" to start a taco stand which he ran for several years before coming back to the US to take care of his mother, at which point he opened his restaurant. People can keep on eating their ""authentic cheese sauce"", I'll be at Honky's Tacos laughing at your ignorant asses"

Talent is everywhere. Anyone who has to work for a living develops talent pretty quickly. The reason rich people are less likely to have talented children is because they're spoiled and don't actually need to develop any marketable skills. I think that's a big part of why family wealth often disappears after a few generations; the original family member to acquire the wealth actually needed to develop skills for gaining and managing money, whereas their offspring don't. So the next few generations just spend money rather than accumulate it."
