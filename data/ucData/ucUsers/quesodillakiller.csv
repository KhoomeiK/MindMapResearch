berkeley,fpevr7g,t1_fpequ1j,1588555997.0,Are there any repercussions for having below 12 units besides financial aid issues?
berkeley,fp1pq4v,t1_foziv3l,1588243866.0,"How hard is stat 134? Surprised to see people go from data 8 to stay 134, I've heard 134 is quite hard"
berkeley,fp1p500,t3_gapary,1588243298.0,I've heard great things about des inv 21. I haven't taken any of the classes yet but I'm enrolled in art w23ac for the fall and plan to take the rest of the requirements soon!
berkeley,fot6wi7,t1_fot0bto,1588046013.0,"In any regular non-covid affected semester, if a student does not usually receive financial aid from the University, are there any consequences for taking below 13 units in L&S?"
berkeley,fof3yer,t1_fo9wo2y,1587725167.0,"Can you explain why those are good to take with 61c? I was under the impression that 188 is a lot easier than 170, and that 170 is very difficult and time consuming"
berkeley,fo4evas,t1_fo2a6f3,1587503156.0,What's the weekly workload like? In hrs/wk. Projects/labs/hw?
berkeley,fnydqif,t1_fnycmrf,1587360118.0,"I think the method length limits are fine bc it forces abstraction with helper methods so if we go back we can understand all the code without it being a giant 120 line block, which also helps debugging and shortening runtimes since it's easier to understand. I've been there before where im reading a giant enigma function (planning to break it up later) and I forget what each section of code does unless I made comments above each section. Readability helps for code! Just my 2Â¢"
berkeley,fny038a,t3_g4jk99,1587350203.0,There are single gender floors if you really are concerned. as someone with very over protective parents they were fine with it bc you'll realize it's not that big of a deal. Each stall is like its own room and you have complete privacy.
berkeley,fnk3blj,t3_g2856a,1587013737.0,"You don't need a CS degree to be a software engineer. I'm sure it helps, but at the end of the day, you just need the programming ability. Plenty of non CS people in cog sci, data sci, stats, or even applied math go on to become SWE."

That aside, this is iconic lol"
berkeley,fnixdnb,t3_g21i1l,1586988053.0,"Am also an average looking girl lol. Frats are easy to get into during the first few weeks since they want to get everyone to rush. Getting to know frat brothers in your dorms or people that go to the parties means bids will be easier to get. In general the frats are trying to get a lot of girls in to improve the guy:girl ratio so it'll be a lot easier for you as a girl than any guy. Not super hard to get into parties in general if you're looking for a party scene. Also every club on campus (besides the Christian ones) generally have a lot of parties or drinking. You'll find that once you get here, if you want to party, they're not hard to find."
berkeley,fmzjuju,t1_fmzhw2c,1586522580.0,"Thanks for the input, this is really helpful. For an average student / person who is not advanced mathematically / uncomfortable with proofs, what do you think a weekly breakdown of a workload for CS 70? Without sahai. 

I need an A- to declare and I'm not comfortable/good with proofs so I'm trying to take it as my only tech next semester."
berkeley,fmcvyjl,t3_fufu65,1585953917.0,"I haven't turned in the last two homework assignments nor do I think I will be able to for the foreseeable future. I literally know nothing and understand nothing past the linear algebra part. Discussions, even CSM sections, and review sessions go too fast and I don't understand anything. Yes I could ask questions but I'm at the level where I understand so little I'd be holding everyone else back. I wonder if I'll even be able to P this class. 

Hope this makes you feel a bit better, I think there's plenty of others that feel the same and just as worried. Wish you luck for Monday's exam!"
