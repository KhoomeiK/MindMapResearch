It sucks, especially considering how good our business program actually is, but we just don’t have the proximity to LA or OC like UCLA or UCI.

That said, our program is a good program and definitely on par with the other UCs. The School of Business has 7 concentration tracks - Finance, Accounting, Information Systems, Management, Marketing, Business Analytics, and Supply Chain. 

Management, Marketing, Accounting are all solid programs. IS is also good if you’re into CompSci, but there’s only so many people willing to teach it so the program is small and a little underwhelming IMO, but the professors who do teach it are great. Finance is ok but they teach more theory than application so you should supplement with campus orgs (Ex. Hylander Financial Group) if you want to learn more about career opportunities. BA is the newest program so its not too fleshed out yet but from what I hear, its IS but more statistics. Can’t speak too much on Supply Chain, other than its hard LOL, but you might have a different experience. 

At the end of the day, its what you make of it. Even though we aren’t a target school, we definitely make up for it in terms of accessibility to resources and supplying a quality education. Most of the UCR Business professors that I’ve had are really good to their students and don’t excessively charge for textbooks or other materials. My best advice is to join campus orgs and get on good terms with your professors asap. Building that network early on can help you in the future (;

I transferred from a CC into UCR so I can’t speak on the transition from Pre-Business -> Business, but PM if you have any questions about being in the School of Business!"
ucr,fg3ufzj,t3_ew8csa,1580489908.0,Not me but I have some friends living at Berkdale apartments (Iowa and Blaine) who have a 7 month lease! Same situation as you as they only needed it for fall and winter quarter this year. You can look into that. Otherwise you might want to look into subleasing
