I also took 54 first semester, wrapping your head around matrices is some tricky stuff. I started skipping the lectures a third way through which was a mistake, but usually 54 and 53 lectures were very abstract and hard to follow, but the better way to approach it, if you have the resolve, is to read the textbook/course notes first for what the lecture will be on. It takes some commitment but it's undeniably helped me, especially for any mathy course. I started doing this for cs70 and every time I did this I was able to appreciate and grasp lecture. However, I think most of the value comes out of doing the hw's. I usually turned them in without correcting them but looking back I would've gotten a lot out of knowing if the all the problems were correct. My discussion section had a thing where we would go over a few of the hard hw problems, and a mini-lecture on new material. Discussion was 100% worth it because it's more personalized.

If I have to end with one thing is that your brain really needs to practice it to internalize it. It varies from prof to prof, but usually there's 2 kinds. The ones who will test you mostly on the fundamentals but have a lot of them, and those that will throw like 5 hard curveball problems at you (and occasionally those that do both in moderation). Both of these will benifit from practice, and usually the curveball ones will make you resort back to the textbook or discussion notes and learn the material better so you can do the critical thinking on the curveballs anyways.

In the end, you only have so much time on your hands, it will be a learning process to see what works best for you, but you'll start making sense of it all as you go along."
berkeley,fosi0rg,t1_fosesyt,1588031100.0,"Ah yes, sorry I forgot that I've grown into these terms. OH means Office Hours. Normally a professor and GSI's (graduate student instructors - usually like a team of 3-12 undergrad students that help teach the course) each hold office hours for like 2 hours where they help students through hw, projects, and basically anything they need help on. GSI's also individually lead different discussion sections where they reinforce lecture material. 

As per practice tests, they are daunting at first but don't worry, you'll get into the groove of them. On your first technical class just find one, print it out, and give them a shot. Just take them one at a time and you'll be good. I usually only use 1 blue pen to correct but I think that's just person dependant. The color is simply to distinguish your original answer from the corrected one. 

Lastly, about headstuck (to be completely honest I just made this term up lmao), it's pretty frequent when you encounter like some long problem statement and then get to the question and start panicking. Or like you start trying a problem and you keep going down some long rabbit hole of work. Or when you just find yourself staring and thinking (and then rethinking, and just generally feel anxious and your head thoughts are swirling) for an unnormal amount of time. Or even just when you open the test and start the first problem and you just can't think. It's more a mental state. I think a better way to know what it is is to experience it yourself. The way you get around it is calming down and taking a few deep breaths and realizing you'll be fine, although this isn't always possible. Temporarily skipping the problem and come back to it later will usually keep you advancing through the test instead of getting stuck.

Best of luck on your first semester when you get there!"

My intention was to share my own experience, and people can try some of these out (if they don't already know what works) and take away and use only the useful ones to them. Thanks for the feedback, I'll try to make it clearer at the beginning next time."
