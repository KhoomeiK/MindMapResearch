nutritionsupport,fnkx5xh,t3_g2a9xo,1587042212.0,"This is a subreddit regarding tube feeding and iv nutrition, not nutrition supplements.

But in regards to your question: most people don't work out or train at a level where supplementation is required, especially if you are just getting back into working out (supplements as in powder protein, bcaas, creatine etc?)
