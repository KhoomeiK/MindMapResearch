politics,fp0n3df,t1_fp0hx4l,1588212618.0,"Approval voting definitely does allow people to support more extreme candidates without effectively voting for their opposition. However, *compared to RCV, * approval voting leans towards the middle. 

The reason for this might be unintuituve: if you can actually vote for your favorite candidate, then why would the system favor moderates? It's because of defensive voting, which is something that exists in pretty much every voting system - approval voting, RCV, what we have now - people tend to have a competitive candidate they are not ok with. How does each system handle this? 

First Past the Post doesn't, so we can toss that. 

Approval voting allows you to still vote for the most competitive, but less favored, option, while giving support to your favorite candidate. You don't lose any voting power from playing defense. 

RCV lets you do nearly the same thing, with the added caveat that you can flag your defensive vote to say ""only count this in the worst case, when my favored candidates have lost."" 

Between the two systems, though it should appear that RCV more closely aligns with the defensive vote sentiment, it's not immediately clear why there should be a difference in result. The problem lies in the fact that your defensive vote is given the same weight as your favored votes in approval voting. This favors candidates with the widest possible draw - naturally, more moderate candidates. 

It also favors candidates from parties who people already consider to be frontrunners; if we implemented this in the States, for example, nearly everyone would toss a vote to one of the two established parties, because it ensures the one you don't like is being voted against. Under approval voting, this guarantees the perpetuation of these two parties as the powerhouses of US democracy. Under RCV, this issue is mitigated (though unfortunately not entirely removed) by allowing your vote to go towards your defensive options *only if they need to.* 

While miles and miles better than what we have right now, the main problem with approval voting is it only measures approval - there is no mechanism to measure enthusiasm or preference. I think RCV does a better job allowing voters to precisely express their feelings on an election, and as such allows for a more representative democracy."
politics,fozekvo,t1_foz2uvx,1588189350.0,"That's true, but even with that boost they only have about half the support the Democratic party has. RCV lets you weight your votes, meaning smaller parties which more closely match voters' preferences can get a boost from higher weighted votes. 

That said, approval voting would still be a huge improvement over what we have now, and I'd be pleased with either system."
politics,foz22cs,t1_foyxvbz,1588183348.0,"I don't think so, because approval voting necessitates movement towards the most inoffensive candidate - movement towards the center. I also used to prefer approval voting due to ease of implementation, but RCV enables a wider span of the political spectrum, which I think has enough value to justify the extra process."
