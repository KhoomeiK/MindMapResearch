Axe guy goes in for a single killing blow, swinging it above his head preparing for one large swoop down. Of course this is a slow maneuver. Spear guy quickly gets a jab in axe guys stomach, stunning him. Then spear guy jabs him in the face. Axe guy goes down.

The moral of the story? Always use a shovel as a spear in a shovel fight."

Of course this has not always been honored. I think I remember when Alexandrr the Great laid siege on the island town of Tyre, the inhabitants killed his Messengers. This infuriated Alexander and they ended up getting slaughtered."
