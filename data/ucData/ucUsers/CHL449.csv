Here's my instagram art portfolio (@paidraws449) if you're interested.  It contains most of the work I've done for these creators:

I usually charge $15/art piece so $50 will get you 3 pieces.  Ill throw in an extra piece for good measure ;)"

Its best they wait and pull a ""Love so Life"" and have them date once Kyoko becomes an adult and has made a name for herself.  My prediction is that there will be a time skip!"

@Denliner made the quarry plaza and college 10 on his own in the old ucsc server.  It was epic.

Now hes in slugcraft building the Boardwalk.  Look for server details in the subreddit"

ENFP,fk7evf4,t3_ff2oca,1583934961.0,"Computer science.  At first i thought i might not be cut out for this major because mostly everyone i was friends with were more introverted types who didnt mind spending long periods of time alone at a computer.  It was weird because i almost felt judged for being too outspoken... as if being quieter meant that you were wiser or something.

Of course, that logic is already flawed lol although it took a while to sift past the self doubt.  But then i did an internship and realized that holy hell you actually talk to a buttload of people like every day in the actual field.  So i feel rather grateful to me being and enfp and being able to connect with people extremely well."
