berkeley,fonlx9k,t1_fomqwd4,1587922020.0,"yeah, sometimes there are homework parties or project parties, where you’re in a room with TAs and other students, working on that assignment.

and yes, lots of students have trouble doing some of the homework questions. that’s why piazza’s a really useful resource, it lets you ask staff about specific questions regarding the problem you’re on. people may also have the same question as you, so they may have asked it already. sometimes the staff will give you hints on how to solve a difficult problem."
berkeley,fonktba,t3_g8an1k,1587921402.0,"YES this has happened to me too. whenever I’m in discussion and working with guys, I’ll bring up my ideas, and they’ll just automatically say “no that wouldn’t work, that doesn’t make sense.” and mind you, it’s just one quick look, like they don’t have time to look at my solution bc they know theirs will be 100% right.

lo and behold though, the TA came around and told me that my answer was right. and then the guys were like oh. can you explain it to me?"
berkeley,focgulo,t1_focfstl,1587671177.0,"how did you discern which classes you needed to phase I & II, considering they only allow up to 17.5 units until adjustment? I really want to add the classes, but I’m scared they’ll fill up before I’m able to add on more units."
berkeley,foc9654,t3_fqdm9d,1587668572.0,how have people’s experiences been with 20 units? I’m planning to take cs61b and eecs16a in the fall with three other breadths. is this doable or am I loading up too much?
berkeley,fo2j6qj,t3_g568mj,1587464451.0,does anyone know if we don’t have to pay campus fees?
berkeley,fo13itc,t3_fqdm9d,1587425018.0,are summer sessions’ campus fees waived?
berkeley,fnm0fsd,t1_fnlty7a,1587062918.0,agree with that; midterms are heavy memorization. overall course assignments are relatively easy though
berkeley,fnkc755,t3_fqdm9d,1587021706.0,has anyone taken histart 186a? how was it?
berkeley,fnijqbn,t3_fqdm9d,1586981186.0,"is it safe to phase II eecs 16a and adjustment cs61b? (speaking as continuing student), just concerned about the lab times for eecs and discussion enrollment for cs61b"
