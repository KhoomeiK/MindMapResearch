As long as you applied before they changed it, they sent you $1k under the old rules, but if you were to call aid they told you you wouldn’t get it and to cancel your order. However, they sent you the grand and said you’d have to provide a shipping invoice for your receipt provided within two weeks or they’d charge you. So not only did they screw over students who were busy studying for a fucked finals week, but then they basically setup the students they gave the money to to get screwed too. Eventually they did give out money to people who didn’t qualify under their new rules that applied right after the change anyway too afaik."

buildapcsales,fpi5vxm,t1_fphdq19,1588634285.0,"Honestly, depending on your case, that $40 could 100% be worth not tearing down your build, plus getting a new board."
ucla,fphlxfn,t3_gdhmts,1588623598.0,"Honestly, given how the grading normally works for that class, I’d take that as you shouldn’t be too worried about it and to expect rather, uh, “holistic grading.”"
AskElectronics,fpehmln,t1_fpdhabl,1588547725.0,"You know, I originally was thinking that this was it as there’s a datasheet for 2SD741 too, but apparently it’s looking like it was a thyristor, and I’m as clueless as I thought. Thank you very much though!"
AskElectronics,fpehb4n,t1_fpcj68h,1588547546.0,"You know, you’re probably right. This is a speed control pedal from a sewing machine, and the only continuity I’m measuring would be from the gate to cathode pins based on the pinout of the one to-39 SRC datasheet I found. If it tests fine with the battery test should I just leave it as is and not open a can of worms?"
AskElectronics,fpdrvus,t1_fpdoxx8,1588532980.0,"Sorry, I should’ve mentioned that I’m already operating under the assumption that the caps on board are at least out of spec, especially the film one. I’ve already got some extra Illinois Cap films lying around from a tube amp rebuild to replace that one. :)

I was just concerned as it seemed that this transistor could be shot, but, as you probably gathered, I wasn’t even 100% sure it was actually a transistor."
ucla,fpdq7uw,t3_gcn7gv,1588532029.0,"Either develop test cases or take a more pragmatic approach to doing your assignments. Don’t start until you understand every inch of the spec, and reread the whole thing if you realize at any point you had a misconception. As an aside, using a text editor with extra compiler errors flags set can definitely help you get better at debugging vs. a full-on IDE."
ucla,fpdppxm,t3_gcisow,1588531744.0,"Besides the risk of infection and cost, I’m just going to throw it out there that Westwood doesn’t feel the same at all when UCLA isn’t in session (ie winter break or summer session A). Right now, Westwood definitely feels closer to that environment, and it’s not exactly the most fun place. This is even more significant if you lack a car/funds to afford longer distance ubers imo, because it can get really boring here being by yourself."
ucla,fpdooe3,t1_fpd8aee,1588531154.0,"Since when were we comparing ourselves to other UCs? Their systems right now are hardly better yes. Stanford 100% does have mandatory p/np right now, stop spreading lies.

AskElectronics,fpc90d4,t1_fpc6270,1588491758.0,"Well, I’m not 100% certain, but I did desolder it from the PCB right now and test it with the diode function on my DMM. The base to emitter reading was 0.61V, but the base to collector reading was 0L, so I believe I should be taking that as a failed NPN? Once again, feel free to correct me as all of my circuit knowledge is from one course. 

I was originally thinking that the transistor would be germanium, but I’ve realized that both the rectifier and zener diodes on the pcb are Silicon, so I’m assuming they wouldn’t have used a germanium transistor? The rectifier diode is rated for 1A average forward current and 50A peak to give you a sizing reference."
AskElectronics,fpc1i91,t3_gcldkw,1588484645.0,"I'm under the impression that this is a TO-39 NPN transistor, but I can't seem to find a match for any of the numbers I'm looking up. The transistor had a ""heat sink"" wrapped around the sides (secured with a snap ring), and it seems to have rubbed off the middle parts of the ID markings. The first two characters are ""D7, the last number appears to ""3"", and the one before that appears to be ""1,"" but it's rather faint. I thought that the whole part number was for sure D7413 at first, but I can't find much of anything for that search term. 

If it helps at all, this PCB is from a '70s Elna (Swiss) sewing machine pedal, and there is a red dot on the top of the transistor. The rectifier (I think? I'm not great with circuits) diode was German (ITT)."

I’d personally venture to say that there’s probably more unknown long-term risks associated with plastics and the aluminum dosing capsules than a simple combustion reaction, but that’s just me. Obviously, these points are moot if low-end butane or lighters are involved."

cars,fozpnfl,t3_gabmql,1588194673.0,"Cheap generic scanners generally aren’t going to have manufacturer specific functions; you’re going to be looking more for something along the lines of an Autel. It might be cheaper to take it to somebody with a DRB assuming you’re only going to need it once.

EDIT: apparently my knowledge of semi-vintage Chrysler’s is out of date and a DRB III emulator exists now. I’d recommend just looking into that as a lot of functionality on those cars is locked into the DRB."

The vagueness of that email made it sound like it was fully possible that winter in person won’t be a thing (if there is an upswing in the fall and no vaccine it’s sensible too :/), so I’d really think twice before trapping yourself in a money pit. As it is, I’m currently paying for a basically unneeded place and I’ll say it’s rather crappy. Although keeping a whole roommate group together might be hard, I’d venture to say that when you decide to back to Westwood there will be no shortage of subleases. Worst case scenario is you couch surf for a couple of weeks until you find somewhere, and even that’s better than being on the hook for half a year of wasted rent payments tbh."

If I was going electric, I’d stick to the newer 510 stuff (take your pick of design as there’s a ton) as you generally seem to get more bang for your buck with more user control over the durability of the power delivery. I’ve noticed that a lot of these smaller makers just aren’t as good at durable electronics design as they are at making physical designs for vaping (electrical engineering is obviously a different skill set).

Also, do note that I’d agree with you on the materials quality; I’m probably going to sell mine because I’m not a fan of how hot the plastic cooling chamber gets and the aluminum dosing caps.
