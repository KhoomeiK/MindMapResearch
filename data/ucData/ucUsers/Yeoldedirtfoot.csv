Are you taking Mauricio or Morimoto?"
UCSD,fmmov8h,t3_fw6p2b,1586209263.0,"I feel you, friend. Some of these classes are rough... Some of these professors clearly did the minimum to prepare for transition. Like, come the fuck on... Some of these older professors make over 100->400k... You telling me you couldn't take a few hours to get one of your TA's to help you unfuck yourself in regard to canvas and how to operate zoom?

 Ugh."
UCSD,fm8wtlf,t3_fts60e,1585857498.0,"Take a breath buddy. You are going to be fine.. It's the ideal time to learn this stuff. I'm a transfer as well, and even taking my first actual Matlab course was initially a huge slap in the face.

Tip number one is to not compare your coding knowledge to others unless as a reference for where you would like to be.  In other words, there are students here who have been coding since junior high. I started coding at 30. Trust me, the learning curve is real, but you need to set some time aside to learn it.

In your case, better earlier than later. There are plenty of videos to help, but they are wide and varied. Try to find a copy of Stormy Attaway's Matlab text book. Don't purchase, just find an online PDF.  Having trouble, PM me and I'll hook you up. Coding used to be a huge source of anxiety to me. Even now, it's difficult, but I understand that it ultimately makes our lives infinitely easier.

Keep your head up, pal."
