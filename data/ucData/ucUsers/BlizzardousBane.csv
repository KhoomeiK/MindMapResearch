No freedom at all until like 80% into the game. You don't even have any choice on party members. Then once you do, each time you switch party members, your paradigm deck gets reset and you have to redo it all over again, which was a huge fucking pain. So 13 ended up being the only RPG where I never shuffled my party members. Battle system is tedious, and instead of giving you the freedom to play your way, the game punishes you for doing it the ""wrong"" way by giving you a lower star rating. By the end, I mostly ended up mashing auto battle because inputting commands wasn't fun. By the time I got to Pulse, I was so bored of the game that I never bothered with the side quests and just finished it for the sake of finishing.

It's strange too, because the Crystarium and the linearity make it similar to FFX, which was my favorite FF. But I think FFX was executed better, because the gameplay was more entertaining IMO.

That was when I bothered to do most of the hunts and side quests, and I even got the Zodiac Spear (before they made it harder to obtain in the Zodiac Age.)

I would agree that it starts to pick up once you get Balthier and Fran. Then it'll get more juicy once you unlock your first Esper and quickenings. Make sure you do the side quests too, because most of the Espers are unlocked that way.

I'm still not that fond of a gameplay system where you just program the characters to fight and walk around, but I think gambits are okay.

ADMU,fotmjpp,t3_g9igex,1588058647.0,"You can. I don't remember ever having any professor who disallowed using tech for note-taking, although some of the older ones might be more technophobic.

Also, in my experience, the DISCS lecture slides are so good that I only ever needed to take notes in a few CS classes, and those are the ones with more mediocre instructors. Of course, depending on your learning style, you might want to take notes anyway"

ADMU,fot2306,t1_fot1c6j,1588042923.0,"Oh, plus since you're on the new curriculum, they won't even start offering certain core classes until enough new curriculum students are scheduled to take them, which poses additional challenges to taking core classes during the intersession"
ADMU,fot1c6j,t3_g9er97,1588042460.0,"You can use up an elective to take a second FLC, take extra units during the intersession, or overload during regular semesters.

If you want to take extra intersession classes, just let your department know during advising, and they can transfer one of your regular semester core classes to the intersession term, then add your 2nd FLC as an extra subject during the regular semester. It depends on whether your department allows this, though. Plus several core departments have gotten stricter over the years, and they now tend to restrict core classes during intersession to majors who have those classes in their original IPS.

I took a lot of core classes in advance during the summer to pursue a minor. 9-unit summers aren't fun, but I survived lol"

I guess staying in is only great if you have the option to even go out in the first place."

In TS2 you just had tops, bottoms, and full body outfits with a limited amount of swatches. If you have Bon Voyage, you have a limited selection of facial accessories. Plus hats and hairstyles are separate! I hate having to look for a hat whose hairstyle matches the length of my sim's ""everyday"" hair.

I have to admit that TS4 has the best CAS, and it's only missing CASt. Muscular sims truly looked muscular, and fat sims were fat. Plus you could mold their individual body parts.

Being able to visit your neighbors and the playable neighborhood areas were also nice."

ADMU,foq3f3t,t1_foq31g1,1587981572.0,"But yeah, in general, a formal email consists of these parts:

* Formal greetings
* Introduce yourself and state the context in which that person would get to know you (student, client, applicant, etc.)
* State your business
* Provide details in separate paragraphs
* Thank them for their time and some variation of you looking forward to their reply
* Formal closing
* Your full name

Also, you have to word your request in a way that doesn't sound like you expect them to go out of their way to accommodate you. Directness is vilified in Filipino culture, and my professor tore into me once for writing that way to one of her colleagues, even if I didn't intend it to come off like that."
