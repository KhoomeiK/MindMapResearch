ucla,fpm4lhf,t3_gduuyk,1588725444.0,"A classic “weeder” class has nothing to do with grades, but more about workload and perceived difficulty. They throw a lot of work at you and go really fast to really push the class, maybe have low averages on the midterms but then ultimately push the grade distribution up for those who decided to stay. The “weeder” aspect is designed to scare away people that aren’t willing to put in the work/really want it before the class is over
Edit: UCs get a bad rep for this, but they do this at literally every college. Just checking to see if you’re all in before you go ahead with your major/path"
ucla,fp8bygv,t3_gbyy6i,1588388515.0,Did we get any stimulus? Just curious

ucla,foztfld,t3_gaidj8,1588196550.0,I think I LA for the class all the memes are about lol
cottagecore,fosycao,t3_g9dryp,1588040623.0,"I would play Minecraft and animal crossing and study the game mechanics if you’re really serious about this sounds awesome. Minecraft is also open source so you could look at that and see how they set things up, even if it’s not directly applicable with the game engine you’re using"
curlyhair,fosxoi8,t3_g9ehru,1588040221.0,These are exactly the kinds of ads that made me SO insecure while growing up. I thought my hair was disgusting but really it was just this bullshit being propagated because someone has to sell everyone a hot iron and a curling wand
conspiracy,fogvzgt,t1_fog00qh,1587757586.0,"Ultraviolet light actually can catalyze ozone formation via photolysis, but still that’s not the main reason why it is dangerous as you said"
conspiracy,fogvl5e,t1_fofxoau,1587757460.0,"Nope, radiation by itself causes cancer. The stronger the radiation, the more likely it is to cause cancer. This is a very well known fact, and why you should wear sunscreen. Ozone can be created by photolysis, this is how it is created in the stratosphere and why the ozone layer absorbs UV, but the two effects are completely unrelated."
cottagecore,fob3phe,t3_g6ipnu,1587655785.0,Ever watched Lost and Delirious?

CoronavirusRecession,fo8bmbr,t1_fo8aitg,1587593470.0,"From the point of view of, the city is getting money from municipal bonds I guess it’s similar to a stock, but in a bankruptcy that’s not really relevant, what’s relevant is who is high up on the list to get paid out first, cities do have bond holders but no stock holders so there are less losers in comparison to a business going bankrupt"
CoronavirusRecession,fo8b6uq,t1_fo8aitg,1587593243.0,"Bond holders get paid before stockholders in a bankruptcy, my point was that pensions come before both. I would argue that with actual stock is completely different: people don’t usually lever up munis(in comparison to stock) so there’s less people losing a shit ton of money (because of the bankruptcy)"
CoronavirusRecession,fo888ia,t1_fo8353g,1587591681.0,"If an entity goes bankrupt, pensions are pretty high on the list of things that get paid out first, assuming the entity has assets that can be sold off. Stockholders are last, but I’m assuming since cities don’t really have anything akin to stock like a business that it’s a little different. Wall Street wants us to believe that bankruptcy is the worst thing that can happen for people, but really it’s the worst thing for people who love owning high risk/high reward stocks and unsecured tranches of debt aka hedge funds"
CoronavirusRecession,fo80k29,t3_g68lwr,1587587760.0,But companies and banks can’t go bankrupt! And we have to protect them before the cities! /s
Paleo,fo186ds,t3_g449lx,1587427723.0,"If you’ve only being doing it one day I don’t think there’s enough data to conclusively say you won’t be hungry enough every day to eat enough calories, I would see how you feel after a week and then if it’s still a problem add some healthy fats. But definitely don’t eat if your body is telling you not to"

CoronavirusRecession,fmnicno,t1_fml1xbj,1586226733.0,Really? because a 17 year old boy in the county I go to school in just died because he was turned away for not having insurance.
Old_Recipes,fmdu6ar,t1_fla6gpk,1585978061.0,"Cut the butter into the dry ingredients before you add the wet: make cubes of butter, about 1/4 inch cubes, they need to be just out of the refrigerator, then take to knives and cut them until you have a nice lumpy looking dough with even chunks. A food processor will do this even better. Now barely mix in the other wet ingredients ( I would suggest a recipe with buttermilk, they tend to taste the best) the butter melts while the biscuits are cooking and provides a place for the gas from the leavening to go, making a fluffy biscuit!"
