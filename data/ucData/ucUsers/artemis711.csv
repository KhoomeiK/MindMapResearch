medical_advice,fp50z8m,t1_fp4yrcm,1588312878.0,"No, that’s probably what caused it. I was drinking a lot of water while I wasn’t fasting, like a LOT. But my comforter was really thick and I would wake up sweating a lot, and it’s been really hot where I live, so I think that’s how I ended up dehydrated. I decided I shouldn’t fast tomorrow either bc I’m still light headed, hopefully I’ll be good to go by Saturday. Thank you :)"
islam,fp4re4x,t1_fp4r70b,1588305511.0,"I triggered something in you 😂 See, so don’t make assumptions that I’m the dumb one lmao. I’m about to graduate from a top university with a high GPA hahaha so I know for a fact I’m not dumb. Just because you leave a religion doesn’t automatically make you smarter. I respect your decisions to leave Islam but please respect mine. It’s called tolerance"
islam,fp4qwtx,t1_fp4qnbu,1588305186.0,"Doesn’t change the fact that you’re pathetic af. I don’t go on subreddits that will piss me off. I practice Islam the way I want to, now go get a life and stop being so bitter. I’m sorry your parents made your life miserable."

fauda,foifmnv,t1_fo6464b,1587785519.0,"That’s true but I feel like so many times we get introduced to a Palestinian character who seems normal and loving, and suddenly they say anti-Semitic stuff and are violent. They do a better job with the second season but speaking as an Arab, it really feels like the show gives the impression that most Palestinians are hateful and anti Semitic :("
UCSD,fodiigp,t3_g6vn8v,1587685115.0,"I’m graduating too. With a political science degree... I applied to a few jobs already, and I either haven’t heard back or I was told they’re no longer hiring bc of COVID 19. I’m still gonna apply to a few other jobs but I think I’ll just stay with my family and focus on studying for the LSAT and law school apps. It sucks though, it’s how none of us envisioned our post-grad."

My mom is a huge fan and desperately wanted to meet him, but had surgery so she couldn’t run. My sister and I caught up to him and asked if he could wait for a moment to take a pic with my mom, and he agreed. He was very nice and friendly about it. I hope he’s staying healthy now!"
