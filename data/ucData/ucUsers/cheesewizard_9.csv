engineering,fphivyl,t1_fpgp8cg,1588622069.0,The pipe must be perpendicular to the plate. Pipe clamps are the wrong direction.
MechanicalEngineering,fphitdk,t1_fpfpf5d,1588622032.0,It is not for plumbing. I need to just connect a metal pipe to a metal plate without solder or welding. Something mechanical.
MechanicalEngineering,fphir5l,t1_fpfg12o,1588622000.0,I cannot do either. Could you give a mechanical solution. This is not pipe for plumbing.
berkeley,fpeptle,t3_gd1i5f,1588552374.0,East schedule go for it
harrypotter,fp8fgwv,t3_gbznj5,1588390957.0,Dumbledore comes off a lot more intense which is great to watch
harrypotter,fp6feii,t3_gblf4e,1588351404.0,This is doodoo
EngineeringStudents,fp1fugq,t3_garl0s,1588234102.0,If you're bad at math you're fucked bro. Go to biology or something
PhysicsStudents,fnkdrur,t3_g0pemz,1587023309.0,Griffiths is pretty straightforward. Purcell is also a good book to use
PhysicsStudents,fnkdqc6,t3_g0z0q5,1587023267.0,"You're wasting time rather than saving. Read the book, write what's important, go through the derivations you need to, and don't shortcut it. This overly strict system is going to slow you down and you can study higher levels of physics like this. You don't have the time. Yea you can do this while taking 1 physics class but if you try to do this while taking 3 you're drowning in notes and losing time for practice and thinking about the material. Simple is better"
PhysicsStudents,fnkdjhx,t3_g1156i,1587023070.0,Focus on the intuition behind E&M and why the vector calc is used where it is. Don't be concerned about identities. Those can be looked up/written down. If you think physics is about memorizing math formulas you're doing it wrong
PhysicsStudents,fnkdbhq,t3_g1esdl,1587022839.0,Are you going to give the rest of the problem and/or tell us what you need help with?
PhysicsStudents,fnkd7xc,t3_g25m9o,1587022739.0,That's not enough time to get good at anything
berkeley,fn1j155,t3_fyn8ap,1586563046.0,What's the server
berkeley,flhr4g9,t3_foxfc5,1585167938.0,Were you born stupid or are you trying to get a degree for it?
