teslamotors,fp2lka9,t3_gar9us,1588263837.0,I wouldn’t buy it now. We bought our MX last Oct with the thought that when the (plaid) or 600 mile range model X comes out we’d trade it in. I’d hold off if I were you!
AMG,foz5qi4,t1_foz57hd,1588185134.0,"i agree the older one sounds better. but that’s it. 205 looks better in coupe form. 204 just looks like Merc cut the rear half off and glued it to the same 4 door car. The newer ones are faster, put the power down quicker.  etc. while still having a V8. therefore, perfect combo. The 204 is nice, don’t get me wrong, but unless you have a Black Series, it’s not better than the 205 (again, just MY opinion, before everyone starts downvoting me lol)"
teslamotors,fouz7k3,t3_g9os9x,1588092794.0,"Until Oct ‘19 Our RR, and Merc were at 51k and 30k respectively. (we drive about 10k miles a year)
we got our brand new Model X last October. It has 11k miles. RR is now at 52k and Merc is at 32k. 
The X has become the car that almost everyone in my family wants to drive."
AMG,fori14q,t3_g92nuo,1588012579.0,"I just hope they don’t use the 63 name and come up with something else. Honestly the 4cylinder it doesn’t matter much to me as this means that my car’s value goes up haha! Also, no one buy this car so that Merc sees what the problem is. thanks for coming to my ted talk"
AMG,fore0dv,t1_for4dn3,1588010622.0,"the w205 imo, perfect balance of tech and power. 204 is too old on the inside"
ucla,fohvldt,t1_fohv4sg,1587773495.0,"it’s unavailable, check back in a few hours, they’re probably uploading my rejection as we speak 🤐"
teslamotors,fogbyos,t3_g7ccx2,1587750619.0,i think its all Model S variants after 10/16 mf date.
teslamotors,foeikat,t1_foei7y3,1587704699.0,"fair enough. (if you care) for me, I recently sold my amg in order to either buy a MY Performance or a used MS P100D, since they both cost around $70k, i’m thinking about going with the MS, the only thing that stops me is that the design is older, & the fact that the Plaid MS is coming out anytime... that’s why I think I lean towards the M3 argument bc the MS is due an upgrade already from the facelift..."
teslamotors,foehvnu,t1_foehj98,1587704186.0,"idk man I just feel like buying a slightly used M3 even  would be better than an old MS that doesn’t have the same range. I agree the MS is much more roomy and has more usable trunk space, but I still think for someone who is buying their First Tesla, it should be one that shows off all the new tech in the car."
teslamotors,foegear,t1_foe5yml,1587703120.0,The ground clearance for cybrtrk is 16’’ do you need more than that?
teslamotors,foefvma,t3_g70go7,1587702759.0,I’m sorry but a model S60 for 35k is not worth it. Unless maybe if it was a P variant!! Spend a lil extra and get the M3. Feel like the M3 offers so much more in tech and it’ll be new/almost new whereas these Model S cars have been driven so so much
ucla,fo8tmhi,t3_g6c2ov,1587603585.0,Did transfer decisions come out? I don't see anything on the portal... :(
UCSantaBarbara,fo8ssnm,t1_fo8sqfk,1587603094.0,congrats!!
UCSantaBarbara,fo8sppx,t3_g68ggq,1587603045.0,I Got in!!! I'm so excited!!!
ClashRoyale,fo7qmks,t3_ejbeae,1587582867.0,the shittest fucking card in the game. this card has literally RUINED THE ENTIRE FUCKING GAME
UCI,fo5b59z,t1_fo56if2,1587521497.0,same boat! hope we both get in haha
UCI,fo4o7dz,t1_fo4o2rb,1587508017.0,dope thanks! did you get in or waitlisted?!
UCI,fo1yr9i,t1_fo1skmq,1587444800.0,weiiird! i’m guessing it’s still glitching out... hopefully they fix it soon
teslamotors,fo1o4ia,t1_fo07j8e,1587437587.0,"I have now had them check this out twice, as its getting worse as I put more miles on the car. Thank you for linking the NHTSA link btw, they also told me that they don't have a solution for it yet, but seeing that this is from DEC'19, seems like they just didn't want to spend the time to fix my car lol."
UCI,fo1kpzm,t3_g54wat,1587435411.0,"Congrats on getting in!! also, can someone explain what it means to be on the freshman waitlist? I applied as a transfer so I'm a bit confused. anything helps, thanks!"
teslamotors,fnj8nrv,t3_g1jaca,1586994071.0,It’s also got the shadow of the guy holding the stop sign :o
AMG,fngcyuq,t1_fng9rqw,1586928500.0,"I wouldn’t say that luxury is compromised because it has more stuff than normal C classes, but you do feel almost everything on the road bc of the suspension. If you want a daily driver, go for the E63, I only drive mine on weekends and use a Model Y for daily usage so for me, the C63s coupe is perfect!"
AMG,fng1gal,t1_fnb5y6j,1586920097.0,you looking for a 4D or coupe?
AMG,fng1c61,t3_g18zzp,1586920022.0,I’ve had a C63s for about 2 years now. ask away if you have any questions.
teslamotors,fna60z9,t3_g0ky5y,1586791695.0,i am in the same boat as you. difficult decision to make
AMG,fmx6je7,t1_fmx52ze,1586459366.0,"so 305’s on the staggered 20” rims should work! dope, thanks!!"
AMG,fmuxcx2,t1_fmrf5yz,1586401005.0,"I have the exact same car as you, need new rear tires soon, if you recommend the 305’s does that mean I’m gunna need new rims? sorry im a bit of a noob"
mercedes_benz,fmuwyl6,t3_fvkyvx,1586400747.0,can’t believe people are recommending an 8 year old car. W205>>>
AMG,fmlm630,t1_fmgkb1e,1586189106.0,i’ve owned both. The W204 was a better engine. but the w205 is a better car. steering is a lot sharper and the tech inside is pretty good. I’m actually thinking about moving to a different AMG by selling my C63s.
teslamotors,flytv0z,t1_flytpfi,1585608993.0,Performance?
