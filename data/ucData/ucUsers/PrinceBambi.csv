nintendo,foktn0n,t3_g7vuf0,1587848723.0,If social distancing ends in the coming months then i would definitely look forward to having graduation!! getting out of uni after struggling for so long will feel like such a burden off my shoulders... and then definitely going home and being able to enjoy food and the company of family and friends
nintendo,fob73zp,t3_g6aegh,1587656814.0,If i had to choose one game it would have to be monster hunter 4 ultimate! I played this game in high school with my best friend and we dropped hundreds of hours playing together and it was just a simpler time.
BraveNine,fnyctf1,t3_fsqd68,1587359374.0,"recently i’ve been seeing the blue mission achievements pop up, but i don’t see an exclamation point for it... what is it? the recent was for going to arena a certain amount of times. it isn’t the regular achievements which are normal like a beige color"
nintendo,fnukvhj,t3_g3ptch,1587264530.0,"In the past month, I was able to move in and quarantine with my girlfriend and she’s been able to help keep my sane with school and possibly my graduation being cancelled. We recently bought a switch so that we could play animal crossing together but it would be great to build a separate island and be able to adventure alongside her!"
