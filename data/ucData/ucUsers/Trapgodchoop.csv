Black students and offices were at the forefront of the origin of so many resources, ie: AAP, SIOC, etc. but yet our history and contributions are routinely disrespected in cases like the murders of John Huggins and Bunchy Carter. When you make up less than 5%, you’ll have one or two Black people in all your classes, even in Af am classes. We’re such a minority that our needs get overlooked 9/10 unless Black students and faculty handle it ourselves. 

Outside of that, I feel one of the biggest misconceptions of this referendum is that it’s a one being ran primarily by USAC, which isn’t the case. A coalition of numerous marginalized communities on campus are pushing for and have been pushing for this referendum."

From CPO to Kerckhoff and even in our off-campus apartments and on-campus dorms. In the past year alone, there have been multiple separate accounts where Black students were called a plethora of slurs, 2 of which occurred in University Apartments. We don’t feel safe or included on this campus, and to add to that we make up less than 5% of students on this campus."
ucla,fng48vi,t3_g1k19p,1586921953.0,Mhm I wonder if it has to do with the fact that a Black student who was speaking during public comment was repeatedly called a “nigger” by someone in the chat.
