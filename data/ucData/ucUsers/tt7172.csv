Sephora,fpf921r,t1_fpf8x57,1588564747.0,So dramatic😈
Sephora,fpf902j,t1_fpf8x57,1588564709.0,If I was banned why can i still order?
Sephora,fpf8osd,t1_fpf8liy,1588564490.0,Just letting others know they can get both their money and product taken if they return online☺️
Sephora,fpf8i0h,t1_fpf8fcr,1588564357.0,Not really~
Sephora,fpf8cvi,t1_fpf8b6v,1588564258.0,I purchased over 250 items:) in 5 months sis
Sephora,fpdvnnt,t3_gcg953,1588535154.0,Moral of the story don’t make online returns if you used a giftcard or debit.  Your possibility of losing both the money and the product is extremely high.  😫
Sephora,fpc76dt,t1_fpc6qwe,1588489907.0,Thanks babe☺️
Sephora,fpc47b1,t1_fpc3uwk,1588487044.0,"I’ve already received an email saying due to too many returns.  Funny thing is I’ve only returned 20 items out of the 250 items I’ve purchased this year.  After this I’m just going to shop at different department stores, I only order at sephora because they have so many brands together and 2 day shipping rouge."
Sephora,fpc3jfh,t1_fpc3ilt,1588486448.0,7000$ in 5 months yes.  Actually its 7288 lol
Sephora,fpbgtmd,t1_fpbgps1,1588469680.0,Yeah i would avoid placing high priced items because they can easily screw you.
Sephora,fpbgk8e,t1_fpbghp9,1588469508.0,I bet that defective dyson is someone who made a return and they resold it to you🙃
Sephora,fpbgc02,t1_fpbgam9,1588469355.0,Did you get your money back?
Sephora,fpbeyau,t1_fpbejrf,1588468454.0,I wouldn’t be surprised if they resold it to someone else since it was sealed
Sephora,fpbeh77,t1_fpbebfb,1588468142.0,"I used their label, it’s on their website.  You put your order# and zipcode and they give you a label"
Sephora,fpbe6s0,t1_fpbdg7s,1588467957.0,It was purchased online and I printed a label and sent it back
Sephora,fpb8a4g,t1_fpb867d,1588464237.0,Yes they said the system blocked it so I’m not getting a refund.  I asked for my product back and they said they cannot send it back. I can still order things.
Sephora,fpb6nub,t1_fpb6m3q,1588463237.0,That’s amazing! I love good sales and free shipping!

Sephora,fp6xvjh,t1_fp3ps2l,1588360500.0,Most of the reviews come from people who received it for free from the company
Sephora,fp6dseu,t3_gajt5t,1588350609.0,Does sephora look at how much $$you spend vs the amount of$$ you return or the ratio of the number of products you purchase vs how much return.  Let’s say you purchase 500 products a year and return 50. Would you get banned for that?
ApplyingToCollege,fp52k4n,t3_gbbfo9,1588314270.0,Is it harvard?
Sephora,fp4sy92,t1_fp4send,1588306587.0,You print it from their return site and it is free return.  I’ve returned something before and it took a month after it’s delivered for them to get processed...
