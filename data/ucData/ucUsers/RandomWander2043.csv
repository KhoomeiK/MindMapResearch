That is where you are dead wrong; some sufferings are definitely worse than others. I’m not sure how you can even come to such an illogical conclusion like that?

Far too many people are overreacting and making this kind of stuff too big a deal. I will admit I think the term “gender fluid” is downright retarded. Sure you’ll have a few that don’t conform, but they just go overboard with their supposed “awareness.” This conversation is one such example. 

My point is that you are obsessing over what should be a small issue, and you don’t seem very bright. Get an education, learn how to think critically, quit the weed, and actually make something of yourself. How are you actually making use of your life?

And you haven’t asked what position you hold at the hospital? You seem too dumb to be involved in all the life-saving that they do. 

Sure, I may be “just a kid” in terms of age, but that is irrelevant if I understand what I’m talking about. I do have Aspergers, but I don’t see any connection here. How would I have proven your point? I have been consistently disagreeing with your irrational mindset the entire time."

And I surely have no clue of the cost to go through the entire transformation, but this argument is out of principle from the social perspective so the amount of money is irrelevant (just the existence of cost is all that is considered). 

So if you see two car wash charities side by side, one to feed a clearly malnourished or underfed person versus a person in the midst of a gender crisis searching for the funds to have the procedure to change, who would you choose?

I do think the “grow up” still applies since you think it is so much more important than it really is compared to other common problems a simple donation could help towards.

For the most severe pain we choose morphine-based drugs over the entire fentanyl class because they are just better for overall pain mitigation. 

I’ve never heard of etonitazene? Gotta check out some of the more novel ones; I don’t give many a chance worth studying and never tried even tramadol. Etorphine in low doses does work as a strong sedative with far less euphoria and at a pretty good price for the medical field. However, the only issue is that the therapeutic index is very low. Any other novel ones worth looking into?

Even the acetylated oxymorphones would probably be very good if taken orally now that I think about it. They would also have a much slower come up than oxymorphone, maybe making it less addictive? The acetyl groups don’t typically add much euphoria to the effects anyways (but no guarantee with this case). 

Fascinating biochemistry and pharmacology...

Anyways, oxymorphone is definitely something to try at least once in your life. I snorted it, never shot, and the euphoria was incredible. It made heroin and weaker opioids seem like child’s play. It came on slowly, then hit hard for a while with a euphoria very similar to MDMA, then I began the best nod ever. The nod felt less intense but similar to hydromorphone while maintaining a very strong euphoria. My recall from those nights is not the best, but I know it was the best high I’ve ever had."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fnz03sx,t1_fnyysjb,1587381988.0,"But isn’t that statement about my opinion very hypocritical on your part?

It is an elective treatment for one’s own insecurities of whatever is between their legs. I would not call that “a good cause” the way that giving a girl money for a new purse is such. 

I’m not phobic of the gender crisis hysteria; you do you, but don’t expect support. No, I don’t understand, but I recognize that there are more important things in the world. Why do there really need to be so many different gender and sexuality identifications? It is so overcomplicated.

ObscureDrugs,fnyzzed,t1_fnyz4q0,1587381868.0,"Acetylmorphone is essentially just acetylated hydromorphone via acetic anhydride, so it would be pretty closely related in this subset of opioids. I’m sure the effects wouldn’t be very different other than potency and duration. What would be interesting is it is using the hydromorph base with an acetyl group, so the metabolism will be much more like heroin and acts as a hydromorphone prodrug with higher bioavailability than hydromorphone. 

The diacetyloxymorphone sure sounds amazing! I came across it online a while back. Since nobody can make it in a pharma lab it’d only be made in a clandestine lab, so I’d be way too scared to try it right off the bat with such a high potency. I’d dope up a rat first, haha. I’m certainly a fan of oxymorphone, but I’ve only had it five times. The idea of its diacetate analog is incredible. If that could be in the medical field, it’d provide a much more economic alternative to oxymorphone and provide effects for much longer. I don’t know why they haven’t done more research into it."

Which condenser are you using for reflux? There are numerous options, but I’m just curious. 

Once you have the product at the end of the synthesis, I’d recommend crushing the crystals, vacuum or heat drying, then washing with anhydrous acetone. Vacuum dry until it seems excessive (or heat, but it’s far less effective). Then get some hot anhydrous alcohol (seems like you have ethanol on hand) and add it drop by drop very very slowly until all is just barely dissolved. Then decrease the temperature over the course of a few days (fridge then freezer) and collect the precipitated crystals from the solution. It wouldn’t hurt to rinse with anhydrous acetone again. Vacuum or heat dry. You’ll get very pure crystals after that, and multiple purifications may be performed. I don’t have exact numbers, but you can assume ~20% loss with each recrystallization.

The drug purification is fairly simple and after the first time you’ll have it down. My typical methods are washes and recrystallizations.

Take amphetamine sulfate as an example (anything ending with hydrochloride, sulfate, etc works) and mix it in 99% pure anhydrous acetone, then run it through a coffee filter. After the stuff in the filter dries up (may be a few days for optimal dryness) you can consume. The acetone dissolves many impurities but the salts remain intact.

A recrystallization of MDMA would consist of dissolving the drug in the absolute minimal amount of 99% anhydrous isopropyl alcohol heated in a hot water bath. Do this all very slowly to avoid excess alcohol in the solution, which will drastically reduce the yield. Move it to the fridge for a day, then the freezer for a day or two. There should be crystals formed of high purity MDMA. You do lose quite a bit, but I think it is worth it. This technique works for a handful of other drugs as well. 

The “anhydrous” property is important. If you have 99% pure without “anhydrous” (cheaper than with that label), then you can mix in Epsom salts that were baked in the oven and remove after a while. It removes all residual water that may screw up dissolving compounds. 

I have played around with a “hexane wash” for cocaine, which is supposed to yield 99.9% pure when street stuff is on par with 50%. It consists of freebasing, then dissolving in hexane, creating a layer separation with water, evaporating off the solvent, then salting with hydrochloric acid. This one is advanced in comparison to the other methods, and carries some risk unlike the others. 

Hope this was a decent explanation! Feel free to ask questions! I began teaching myself chemistry after finding inspiration in drugs, and now I have a home workshop where I am looking at alternative energy sources and sustainable living."
ObscureDrugs,fn5p8ux,t1_fn5f7oc,1586671337.0,"Oh wow, that’s really crazy to hear. I’ve always held the belief that drugs aren’t inherently bad, and the street drugs with the worst reputation just lack the quality and purity to be used most effectively. Nowadays I purify substances before consumption and the difference is worlds apart. I haven’t heard of anyone actually being prescribed Desoxyn, so I deeply appreciate what you’ve had to say."
ObscureDrugs,fn45xs4,t1_fn3zhfk,1586634720.0,"Any conjecture on why street and pharma meth feel so different? Hypothetically if I had some from the street then recrystallized and washed a few times do you think it’d be the same? Is there anything else in Desoxyn that works in favor of the methamphetamine? I’ve eaten and snorted street meth a few times and hated it for those side effects even in 5 or 10mg doses. I currently use amphetamine that I clean at home and never feel anything negative from it. Never did think about cleaning the meth since it was already a solid chunk, as dumb as it was looking back."
ObscureDrugs,fn1f55z,t1_fn1eqyb,1586560720.0,"It’s just a gnarly crazy experience and I frankly don’t know why I enjoy it so much. Although this is not a great analogy you could say it is like alcohol with extra loss of motor control with a dash of bad trip mixed in. Ether is easy and cheap to make as well as nontoxic, so that does play into its favor quite a bit. Not something I do often, but it’s a novel experience that’s fun to have."
ObscureDrugs,fn1ej93,t3_fypo0c,1586560361.0,"Oxymorphone, hydromorphone, diethyl ether, 2C-B, and amphetamine. All but amphetamine are super great highs, but nothing has helped me succeed at work and school like speed so it gets a top spot. I’ve done over 25 different drugs and counting, however these undeniably stand out over the rest. Maybe a sixth would be MDMA although the hangover with the wait time is pretty rough."

It goes over very many in depth, but it was published long ago (70s I think). There aren’t many mentions of obscure drugs."
