UCSD,fphrs3i,t3_gcxj93,1588626622.0,"Definitely apply for grad housing. If you're not picky (e.g. wanting a one bedroom), it's pretty easy to get in. South/Central Mesa/OMS are the most affordable I believe, but Mesa is pretty old and bug infested (as is Coast, but that has the benefit of it's awesome location), so keep that in mind. OMS is kind of small. 

All of the grad housing except Coast is within about a 10-15 minute walk of Thornton hospital, depending which one you're in. The university has a shuttle that goes to the Hillcrest hospital from there too.

Being near nature and near the hospital simultaneously is not really possible, though it will depend on your definition of ""near"". Torrey Pines is not that far from the graduate housing if you have a car or don't mind a decent bike ride. Coast probably has the better location if proximity to good running spots is more important than proximity to the hospital."
UCSD,fphr20e,t1_fphh44d,1588626238.0,"Instructors don't have much say on these matters in general. I wouldn't read too much into the usage of the word ""choosing""... it's really gonna be up to the admin."
UCSD,fp71zzz,t1_fp6og8d,1588362598.0,"Posting a question on Chegg counts as contract cheating. You're getting somebody else to do your homework for you. I agree that it is a bit ridiculous for it to be classified as so much worse than copying a homework solution from a posted answer key, but it is."
UCSD,fo8ogb7,t3_g5x3pq,1587600595.0,"So, I'm a TA, and we were told you are absolutely not allowed to force students to show their ID on Zoom, and recording them on Zoom is a violation of campus privacy rules (and potentially state law). 

So you should absolutely complain to the department about this.

edit to clarify: recording exams isn't allowed. Recording lectures with students visible is allowed provided all students have given consent. The rules as written may actually be allowed because of the option to be proctored live instead of being recorded, so nobody is being forced to be recorded."
UCSD,fo5fz9i,t1_fo3zcx8,1587524724.0,"Why do you think this means their research is suspended? As a graduate student, I can confirm to you that it very much is not. If you're required to do lab or field work, certainly it can cause problems, but that doesn't apply to everyone."
UCSD,f94sny3,t3_e3quam,1575101421.0,"I'm not sure about the holidays issue, but if the mail room is open I expect they will sign for you. They do in graduate housing anyway. It is possible it's different for undergrads but I doubt it."
