If not, they can and are legally allowed to charge you every single montly rent payment of the duration of your lease.

If you don't pay, they will formally evict you and can put your non-payments in collections. This will make it very difficult to rent in that state ever again, and having debt in collections will ruin your credit score.

It could even damage job prospects, as some employers pull credit checks as part of background checks.

And if you don't pay, you'll be formally evicted, which will come up every time you submit a rental application in California from now until the end of time

AND they can send your missing payments into collections, which will destroy your credit score.
