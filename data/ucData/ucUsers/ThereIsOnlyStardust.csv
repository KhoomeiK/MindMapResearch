UCSC,fp6wsxi,t1_fp65q4f,1588359956.0,It is a societal issue. But that doesn’t mean people get a free pass to be shitty. It means that we just have to go out of our way to be better people and consider the impact our actions have on others.
UCSC,fp6m8dc,t1_fp6fxm4,1588354750.0,I mean both are relevant. They’re all just snapshots of a larger picture taken at different points in time
UCSC,fp6llif,t1_fp6begv,1588354438.0,"Yes, that was my point, because there are less minority students they tend to end up working with the same people over and over while a non-minority student can choose people like themselves and still have different partners every time. And that’s just for task where one has to have a partner.

Most school work such as studying and test prep does not require one to have a partner, however working with other students can massively improve the process. Having peers to help explain concepts or bouncy ideas off of can be a huge help. Non minority students tend to form study groups at far higher rates then minority students due to the clique reasons mentioned above. Minority students are tend to be far more likely to have to be holding employment along with school further reducing their ability to find time to meet and work with peers. 

Ultimately the culture within and outside of STEM can be much harder on minority students even despite the best efforts of faculty and staff. Randomly assigned partners and groups such a MESA at UCSC can be massively beneficial but at the same time they can only go so far and can’t address all of the facets of the problem."

UCSC,fp5bwsn,t3_gbatlh,1588323594.0,"While I do think Berkeley has a different environment then UCSC I have seen all of these examples occur numerous times in BSOE. In particular the cliquishness is real and impacts all minorities in STEM. I've been in situations where there has been, in my eyes anyway, blatant sexism that the men in the group seem to just not notice. I don't really blame them for it individually, its a societal issue around what kind of behavior we are conditioned to accept and what we are not. Hopefully by having post such as this point it out people will be more alert to it occurring."

factorio,foiwejj,t1_foiw6kb,1587799284.0,I think the rail block overlay would be far more confusing if it was all one color. The bigger issue I think new players have with the rail networks is not the colors but understanding the logic trains use when pathing / interacting with signals.

bisexual,foc7cge,t1_foc5r34,1587667956.0,"The amazing thing about gender is that there is a whole spectrum out there and that one doesn't really have to label themselves in it. At the same time of course I know that putting a label on things can be very gratifying / helpful. 

You could be a feminine trans guy, a butch woman, genderqueer, non-binary or any other manner of labels, ultimately its up to you to decide which, if any, fits. 

In terms of 'transitioning' theres also no real rules on that. I have an AFAB friend who identifies as a trans man but has chosen not to take testosterone at this time as they are a singer and don't want to affect their voice. I also know someone who identifies as non-binary and is micro-dosing testosterone in order to develop a deeper voice and some facial hair growth but plans to stop it once these changes begin. Lots of non-binary people only socially transition and do very little to nothing medically. There is no one size fits all transition; social or physical.

It's, of course, also possible that you may just be cis. If you can, once the world becomes more normal anyway, you may want to see if you can find a gender therapist or a gender questioning support group. They may be able to help you tease out some of your thoughts."
bisexual,foc5ake,t3_g6rr02,1587667274.0,"It’s very anecdotal but I feel like people who spend a lot of time thinking about sexuality tend to be more sexually open and comfortable around related topics. And, in general, people who aren’t straight have had to do a lot more thinking about sexuality then straight people so by comparison tend to be more open to talking about such things. Obviously this is a vast generalization but I definitely think there is a correlation."
bisexual,foc4uks,t3_g6s4te,1587667122.0,As someone who is bi and trans exploring my sexuality definitely led to exploration of gender identity as well and ultimately to me coming out as trans.

It’s a balancing act given that this sub gets a lot of new people looking for advice who aren’t always that aware of the greater LGBTQ issues and especially unaware of trans and non-binary issues.

The mod team removes such content and bans people semi-frequently over such posts. However, at least personally, the majority of such content I have dealt with was never reported and stuff I simply stumbled across while reading through the sub. Reports increase the speed at which we respond to potentially rule breaking content and make sure a human actually looks at it. We do have automated filters around common transphobic phrases but they’re only so good and a lot slips through.

Edit: To add onto this now that I’m more awake. The prevalence of non-directed anti-enby sentiments is an issue the mod team is aware of and has discussed internally. How exactly it will be addressed is still in the works; Covid and our ongoing rule overhaul have pushed back a lot of our plans in general. There is currently a draft post in the works similar to the “/r/Bisexual and Transphobia” post a while back which will be aimed at addressing non-binary issues specifically."
