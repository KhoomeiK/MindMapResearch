AskReddit,fpm7j39,t3_gdzb3i,1588727157.0,"In many, many classes in k-12, I would be literally the only student not talking, but consistently the only one singled out and punished. This had even happened twice in auditoriums with 500-1000 students. I was berated and kicked out despite the people around me saying that I hadn't done anything wrong. In classes, the students who defended me would be punished as well. 
Among the most absurd examples is this one day during middle school PE when we were outside by the track and I was once again being singled out for talking. My teacher (same guy from one of the auditorium instances) demanded that I sit down and read a book. A few of my friends protested and were given detention. Now, this was gym and I was in uniform and the lockers were really far away, so I started to head that direction and he starts yelling more saying that I can't go anywhere and to ""just read a book"". My only response was "" I don't have a book?"" and he gave me Saturday school. Some of my classmates got upset and called him out for always falsely accusing me so he threatened to suspend them and made them run on the track on this particularly hot day until they vomited or were bleeding from falling over in dehydrated exhaustion."

UCSD,fpbp9ks,t1_fpboxe3,1588475332.0,Maybe a better question is: are the people who try to apply right now able to schedule a consultation
UCSD,fpbp4ti,t1_fpboxe3,1588475241.0,But does that apply for people who had already applied and are just waiting for their consultation appointment?
UCSD,fpamz34,t1_fp952t7,1588451503.0,When did you fill it out and how long did it take to post?
UCSD,fpam886,t1_fp9oh9a,1588451059.0,Why is the money going towards summer students?
UCSD,fnpcnbh,t1_fno3bsd,1587143164.0,"Agreed, but side note: we already all had zoom licenses, most people just didn't know that. Everything else is solid because obviously students who *can't come back can't just be made into second-class students with less access to the prof."
UCSD,fnpav2b,t3_g2w79z,1587142273.0,"I took this class one summer and I suspect that it won't be much better in person. On the plus side, it sounds like she curves now, so that's a plus. She only had one extra credit assignment when I took it.

Edit: I should mention that the issue was that the labs are a lot of work over summer and most of my labmates were not helpful/didn't contribute."
UCSD,fnobcq1,t1_fnnz5vk,1587119204.0,"Right so, profs can do their thing and just accept the new students' catch-up work within a reasonable time frame. Otherwise, what would be the point of the week 3 deadline?"
UCSD,fnntwbq,t3_g2u02b,1587101593.0,"I did. I mean, you could just add them & ask for an extension if there are seats. I wouldn't have asked the prof first, but that's not really fair of them to say no.

The point is that we have to feel out how classes are going and have the chance to change it up, right? I've never taken polisci, but i added an ud cogs class. Prof just gave a very short extension like okay, catch up on assignments by Monday (this was Wednesday)."

Too. Many. Notifications. All throughout the day. × short-term memory= chaos. Normally, I hardly look at my devices when I'm not working which obviously isn't an option anymore. It's hard to manage due dates and work schedules. I can't simply silence canvas/email because I'll miss everything, but the sheer volume makes my schedule reminder notification system practically useless.

:A possible solution: filtering/flagging email messages with content that signals often, but isn't important so that it's rerouted to another folder. 

ಠ_ಠ
Canvas files all over the place. Please explain why my lecture slide files are in the syllabus tab in one class and under the assignment tab in another?

:my approach:  in my schedule next to items todo, I make a list of what to find where, but this is more steps and extra time, so idk if it'll help anyone especially considering one class has an inconsistent filing system. For this one, I only check the files tab and hope for the best.

(◎_◎;)
In-session-sourced distractions during lecture time.

:my approach: only watching the recorded versions...and then missing the '""office"" hours' by mistake. Woops.

(⌒_⌒;)
Tech issues while trying to access content then losing line of attention trying to email profs about it and then getting a response at night when it's time to try and fix my sleep schedule.

:my approach: slide the L into the there's-always-p/np-and-the-university-never-cared-about-my-education-or-wellness-anyway basket.

ಥ⌣ಥ
I've noticed that all the extra mental energy expenditure on top of all the regular extra energy expenditure to get things done has exacerbated my usual symptoms (especially working memory & sleep issues). I would imagine everyone is probably struggling with synching their perception of time as well. It's all quite the mess, but I'm trying to focus on wellness over everything else.


Wishing everyone well and the best of luck!!"

UCSD,fnamhzo,t3_g0f99c,1586800055.0,"This joke creates the risk of off-loading the responsibility of providing a decent education from the institution we have entrusted with that role. The picture is cute, but I am disturbed by the idea of students blaming themselves and adding stress to an already stressful situation. We pay the school to do it right."
UCSD,flsgwij,t1_flsdhj5,1585441855.0,"This has happened to me and several students I know, more than once. In one class, 15 students were not added.

But I agree, no need to worry and probably no action required yet."
