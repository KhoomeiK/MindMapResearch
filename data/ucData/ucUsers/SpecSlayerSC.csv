I did use math to speed up my pow sufficiently.

Mul is the problem for me. I'm using cache blocking with SIMD, and adding OMP/unrolling to everything. I keep seeing people talk about a special way to convert the matrix for using SIMD effectively, but still have no clue where to begin with that. Thanks though!"

One thing that is pretty awesome for getting my CFB fix is CFB podcasts. I personally recommend the College Football Bros Podcast. I actually subscribed to their Patreon which got me into their Discord and is a lot of fun.

Other ones (that are more professionally based) are Cover 2 from Athlon and Cover 3 from CBS Sports. CFB Bros is cool because they are funny."

The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie of all time in an era of superhero movies.
The Prestige is one of the most insane stories I have ever seen."
