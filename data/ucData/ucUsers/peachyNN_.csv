ucr,fpf4aiz,t3_gcy59o,1588561442.0,"I am in the same group chat, and saw your post. I think it wasn't really smart to be sending pictures of what the quiz consists of onto the GroupMe, because there is a TA there present. Also, there are square heads in there that will call you out on shit. 

Regardless, I don't think you have to worry so much about it, because the quiz IS due on Saturday.. you just wanted to have a conversation with your peers about what you got wrong and making sure you know the right answer, so you can learn from it. That would be my honest explanation."
ucr,fo5qsrz,t3_g4z500,1587532844.0,"I am going to have to go with a no. Do not take my guess too much into account, but schools are going to be the last phase to be open. First and second phase need to bypass first before the third. We have people protesting and going against the recommended guidelines... I wouldn't be surprised if campus closing goes into Winter 2021"
ucr,fo5qdsa,t3_g5mmvt,1587532491.0,"Pretty much, thought I would be a ""good student"" and visit my advisors to make sure my education plans and everything are top notch. Learned that they're pretty useless. You are better doing research and everything on your own. Unless its something that the advisors need to approve... good luck with that. 

My friend told me how her advisor told her to take certain classes because it was required. Next time she sees her, the advisor is asking her why is she taking a class she doesn't need.. what a mess."

ucr,fmkazez,t3_fvs7u3,1586149270.0,"Hi there, I am interested in helping you with this!!! I am looking for something to  that can benefit/help others during this quarantine period. The only problem is I have no experience in app developing whatsoever, nor am I a major in computer science (or any other major that has to do with program development). I do want to contribute in some way, so if there's a position for me to be able to help you with that, I would gladly!"
