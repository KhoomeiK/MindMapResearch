Like I want to know if 3 arrows is equivalent to 3 wins with 1 arrow. By playing a utility agent and trying to support my team, am I wasting my own time? 

From the initial release post, I really thought the system would be mostly win or loss dependent, with tracking on outliers (30 bombs or 2) only to catch smurfs or misplaced people, but I feel like it’s individual performance first and then win/loss subtracts/adds to your gains rather than the other way around.

As someone who likes to be a team player and make team player moves like baiting/pushing, staying on B solo when 3 are seen A, playing utility agents, it’s ironic that the more I rely and trust my team the worse my score becomes."
VALORANT,fph03hx,t1_fpg9wwn,1588612593.0,"I get that they want to reward individual play, but man the ranked system prioritizes individual play so much. If I was the Raze normally I'd take this trade 10/10 times, but after seeing how my personal performance affects my ranking I would do this once or if we're losing. I used to not understand why people got so angry about trading, calling it ""baiting"" or the sort and always said it was an essential part of the game. Now, I can understand why people are frustrated. Usually I don't mind it since sometimes you bait, sometimes you're the one who gets baited and it tends to even out but the mere knowledge of the system makes you less likely to be willing to take that risk. I suppose they try to balance it out by including first bloods into your score, but then it depends a ton on what agent you're playing and I don't want to play Phoenix just to have a good time."

smashbros,fpfq10h,t1_fpfjyhr,1588579367.0,"They're different enough to impact gameplay at a high level imo. Dark Samus has a lower chaining hitbox on her up smash, lower projectiles, longer dash dance cooldown, faster roll, and maybe a smaller f-smash hitbox I forgot. The first 3 are pretty noticeable and definitely change what options I go for depending on who I'm playing. I personally play samus because her tighter dash dance makes her ground game more controllable.

This difference even reflects in pro play when you see the playstyle of YB vs. Quik. Quik plays Samus and plays a ground game dashing back and forth and baiting close range charge shot cancels. YB plays Dark Samus and prefers aerial charge shot to b-reverse and mix up his landing with a lot of projectile pressure. He's also more willing to go for up-smash options, especially with smart bomb ledge traps compared to Quik."

Unfortunately, they didn’t make that clear at all. 

I think if they had a longer finale or double final episode, everyone could get what they want. One episode as a battle where the avatar is using force via all 4 elements finally mastered, and another spiritual battle between the two wills set aside as an internal strife in a different universe/plane. 

Instead, the pacing as it is would’ve made anything other than a short resolution a real mood killer after all that built up during the battle. There was no simple solution that wouldn’t have taken a long time."

VALORANT,fors0yq,t1_forohnv,1588017500.0,"IMO I think Phantom is better right now precisely because of the way recoil works in Valorant. There's way less incentive to one-tap in Valorant compared to CS:GO. Shorter range fights, increased movement/smoke options make getting the first tap much more complicated, and because of recoil reset/random spray mechanics, it's much better to have consistency where you can which the phantom provides. Headshot one guy, spray down the other is your only option it feels like when getting pushed by a coordinated team. Tagging is so severe in this game too, that if you hit a body shot and they miss their headshot, it's not nearly as simple as them walking away and coming back to one tap you again.

VALORANT,fo5np96,t3_g5uijt,1587530323.0,"Pick better spots to be in. You don’t fight these at this level, you prevent yourself from getting in that situation in the first place. You want to be at an angle where you can choose your fights, better yet, an angle where the opponents don’t know where you are.

If you’re retaking a bomb site, it’s about how you enter. As you walk in, peak the obvious spots where people might be lurking to get you before you even get to a spot to look on site. 

Once you’re potentially overlooking site, slowly check your spots. People tend not to group up in one spot because of abilities, and because it’s way easier for you to spray them down. This means you need to try your best to look at one place at a time. 

Okay site *looks* clear. Approach the bomb slowly, and get ready to shoot. Again, still employing this tactic of aiming at one potential peak at a time. If you know where they are, don’t walk into the shot. Break the silence and strafe out to avoid an easy headshot. 

Site is clear, and you’re on the bomb. Look at where it’s placed. Is it placed anywhere specific? Bomb placement at a decent level of play is either 

1.	The safest and fastest place they could plant.
2.	The easiest place for them to get the peak on you as you defuse.

The faster the plant was, the more likely it was 1. If you think it’s 2, fake a defuse and look at the area you think they planted for. If someone “plants for long”, it means they planted at a place where they could go far away towards the other side of long. They can peak out once they hear the defuse with a clear line of sight on the bomb. If there are 2 people and you haven’t seen them, this is the one exception where they may be grouped up in this area and this is where you most likely can not choose a better angle."

Cringetopia,fo069ud,t1_fnyobjp,1587406822.0,"Someone else already properly mentioned the two metas (video games vs self-referential), but the self-referential part is really hard to understand conceptually even for English speakers. He’s right, you’ll pretty much only understand it if you see it, which is luckily likely as it’s very popular for such an uncanny word. I’ll try to give some examples though. 

Many reddit posts, for example, are tagged as META because they’re a discussion about the subreddit itself, maybe the quality of posts or how to tag certain things. They break the typical content of the subreddit to discuss the content itself. 

Some jokes otherwise known as tongue in cheek, or self-aware, can also be described as “meta” because they similarly break the typical relationship between a joke and it’s subject. Usually you make a joke about rich people or something, but if you make a joke about your joke, it’s self referential and meta. 

Another term you’ll hear often is “metacognition”. Sometimes you’ll experience this when you read about a logical fallacy like the Fundamental Attribution Error, which states that people tend to attribute their mistakes to circumstance, their successes to their personality, while doing the opposite to other people. Then, next time you see someone acting like an asshole on the road, you might think to yourself “What a shitty driver... or actually, maybe this is that fundamental attribution error thing I read about. Maybe he’s actually just tired like I could be”, and in that moment you’re thinking about how you think which is what metacognition is. In this case it’s hard to fit the words “self referential” in describing this, but it’s the same feeling. You think about your own thinking, a joke about your own joke, a subreddit post about subreddit posts."

Sure, a lot of newer companies have since abandoned business casual for just casual but it’s not just a radical shift in paradigm, they’re different culture entirely. Agile startups are a different breed, and thus are able to get away with this sort of behavior because it’s “within expectation”, 

For everyone else, there are plenty of companies that quite frankly, are not agile enough to support this. There will always be large monoliths of companies unable to adopt such a shift, and for every monolith there will be a subset of other smaller companies that must follow this culture to appease the monoliths they must work with. 

No one shows up to anything at all in horse-drawn carriages, wigs, and a cane, but we do show up to weddings in suits and ties. I don’t ever see business casual being eliminated as long as some notion of formality exists imo, but I’m obviously just some random guy on the internet."

Seems like a decently low temperature, at least enough to balance out the yeast and the bacteria no? I’m having problems with my bread rising and wouldn’t the yeast be enough for that?"

Sourdough,fmxz4vi,t3_fx9iub,1586474760.0,"Having trouble getting my bread to rise. Here’s a few key problems

Sourdough starter peaking: When it’s doubled in volume after about 12 hours, the surface is generally lacking bubbles. Starts to deflate around 14 hours. Smell is not present if at all. Floats a bit and then sinks. Around 24 hours, the volume has decreased to around 1.5 its size but a lot of bubbles. Smell is good. Passed the float test.

Which one of these is right? Am I missing some magic middle point? 

Additionally (probably related to this) my dough will not be doubled in size but will be passing the finger indentation test. Which one do I trust more?"
HomeNetworking,fmxj8ma,t1_fmxj1ar,1586466012.0,Thank you so much! I will try to let you know how things go. The costs are starting to rack up quite a bit so I’m not sure now is the time but my wifi at home is so spotty that I may just bite the bullet.
HomeNetworking,fmxivlf,t1_fmxibmw,1586465820.0,"Sorry, last question. By saying instead of the ends, would I need to remove the plastic ends and wire it directly into the patch panel?"
HomeNetworking,fmxi63y,t1_fmxggtn,1586465442.0,"So it goes

Wires --> Patch Panel --> Switch --> Router?

Would I need to purchase another 7 ethernet cables to connect between the patch panel and the switch, or just 1?"

HomeNetworking,fmxascr,t1_fmxa9rm,1586461572.0,Makes sense. A proper store bought ethernet cable will match the T-568A standard correct? Or will I have to build one myself.

HomeNetworking,fmx5iti,t1_fmx22wr,1586458831.0,There are 8 in total I believe. Does this mean the wall outlets are for phone and not internet? So not possible?
