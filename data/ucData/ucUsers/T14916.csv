berkeley,fp7bjll,t1_fp783nr,1588367536.0,"Yeah, the logic doesn’t work when 99% of stem classes are curved, and people are willing to do anything to get ahead, especially if it’s a pivotal class for grad school/industry/etc."
enviroaction,fp65ygo,t3_gbj9yx,1588346679.0,"I mean considering that people are releasing guidelines on how to reuse masks as they are in short supply, I would say that it isn’t too bad? I know my dad has to reuse his mask, and he keeps three that he uses on rotation. Most of the hospital functions this way. They also reuse much of their PPE due to short supply. However, in general consumption has increased because that’s how we used up the whole supply in the first place, unless hoarders are really making that much of a difference. I’m not an expert by any means, just sharing some of my thoughts over the past couple weeks on this."
berkeley,fp0u5sm,t1_fp0bi4q,1588216987.0,"188 isn’t a high workload class in the first place. From those who I’ve talked to, 188 seems to be one of the more doable summer classes. Completely agree with the 61C point though, the projects in that class are long and hard as is, especially if you’re not used to programming at a lower level."
berkeley,fowo25r,t3_g9vxb0,1588123622.0,"What do you think about the Governor releasing the stages of social distancing, and that we may be weeks away from preparing to open school?  I saw your post on Piazza (not in the class tho), and was then saw an alert about the governor shortly after. Honestly, it doesn't seem responsible to open schools at any capacity so soon, for the safety of the parents if anything.

pathofexile,fo3bvvo,t1_fo3ayjg,1587484233.0,"I feel like there is a difference between what is technically an ""independent studio"" vs what the indie genre means colloquially.  I agree with your definition of indie, even if the formal term just means ""making your own games"" or something along those lines.  Calling a game ""indie"" always gives me a vibe that it's kind of against the grain or at least pushing what is mainstream, often refreshing, and not made by a large company known to the masses (like Blizzard, EA, Valve, etc.)."
todayilearned,fnw4rs1,t1_fnvdq6a,1587311423.0,"Not to mention, artistic endeavors in Japan's early history during the Heian period was entirely led by women. While they didn't have much control over society and power over government, a lot of important works like Genji Monogatari, Ise Monogatari, etc. came from women at the time. Even modern hiragana has its roots in Onnade, which literally means woman's hand."
berkeley,fnqgk3g,t1_fnpsqqa,1587164170.0,"Yes. 189 works off of 126, whereas 189 and 127 are more parallel."
berkeley,fnpl81c,t1_fnpk8xo,1587147460.0,"from what I’ve heard 126 is really hard so taking that with 189 would be tough. Also I think that the probability background in 126 is something you should know going into 189, although I haven’t personally taken either yet; what I’m saying is just hearsay from friends who have."
billieeilish,fmrcsow,t1_fmqm0xf,1586319560.0,"I feel like autotune gets a bad rep overall. While it can cover up someone being bad at singing, it can also be used to achieve a sound that isn’t possible otherwise. I think a lot of billie’s use of heavier autotune reflects this idea of autotune as a creative tool rather than a way to cover up mistakes."
berkeley,fmmjz4e,t1_fmmgdz2,1586206653.0,"If an RA in charge of the health and safety acts in such a way that he or she could endanger the residents of said floor, I would consider writing it in a feedback form. If her personal choices can have a demonstrable impact on her ability to complete her own duties she should be held accountable for it, in my opinion."
fountainpens,flr59gx,t1_flqyz75,1585413250.0,"Idk about organic studio ink, but if you’re having flow issues get the wettest ink you can. Personally I find waterman and pilot iroshizuku ink pretty wet. Try and stay away from quick drying inks as well. Noodler also has a lot of wet ink."
