1. Be considered a resident of California according to the UC system. 
https://admissions.berkeley.edu/residency-requirements

2. Attend a community college with a TAP (Transfer Alliance Program) curriculum. You can find them on https://cep.berkeley.edy/transfer-alliance-project-tap

3. Get a high GPA 

4. Do extra circulars with leadership positions: Student gov, honors society, advocacy (LGBT, lower income, sustainability, etc.) 

5. Make sure you’re interesting as a person. Have hobbies, life experiences, expand your knowledge outside of your person bubble, etc. 

6. Make sure you understand how Berkeley’s pre-major status works. There’s a chance you will be accepted, get to the school and not get into your desired major. (It happens quite often)

7. Start studying before you think you need to. Quite often professors from 4 year universities will teach the exact same curriculum at a community college and have the same expectations. Not all professors are push overs, but the teaching ability of professors, at well funded community colleges, is better at a CC compared to a 4 year.



Why is this downvoted? This is the best way to get into UC Berkeley. California community colleges have priority over 4 year students."

UCSD,fo06luf,t1_fnymka4,1587406987.0,UCSD does not really care about personal statements. They mainly care about GPA. That is how I was advised by a UCSD rep
