MoreTankieChapo,fp350st,t3_gay99u,1588273195.0,"I've been increasingly involved with black hammer recently but as a Jewish person this gave me huge pause. I emailed one of the other organizers I've been in contact with before with my concerns. The tweet has only been up for about 8 hours, let's hope they address this appropriately and take this as a learning opportunity and uplift all comrades. I see the point he's trying to make about revisionism and other genocides being ignored but this is NOT the way to do it. It's a shame that what could've been a constructive point is so deeply steeped in anti semitism. Very disappointing, but I hope to see a course correction from black hammer as they do good work."
communism101,fp066qu,t3_ga633l,1588203231.0,"I'm currently reading a book called America's Other War: Terrorizing Colombia by Doug Stokes. It goes into the formation of the FARC, their relationship with coca producers, and how they were villified by US foreign policy, which had a strong grip on Colombian politics at the time. It centers around US intervention and doesn't go into too many details, but I think it properly dispels any myths about them being terrorists"
communism101,fo3pp9u,t1_fo2kywq,1587490910.0,"Damn, I have never heard of that lmao. Is there good potential for leftist political action on your campus? I go to University of California, Santa Cruz, which was the epicenter of the statewide grad student strikes that started late last year. My experiences at the picket line led me to want to form a ""revolution club"" so to speak, as I met lots of budding demsocs, anarchists, and some genuine commies including our strong local chapter of Anakbayan. AB is cool, and I'm somewhat involved with them, but it's mostly for Filipinos who are already pretty staunch communists, so I wanted to create a more catch-all type club for any leftists interested in getting with the shits. What sort of organization did you have in mind?"
communism101,fo24mtb,t3_g4zdzf,1587449582.0,"I'm a university student in America, and I joined Platypus which is basically like am armchair commie book club. Good for reading and discussing theory, though. I was intending to start my own sort of club with a more action-based intention since nothing else like that existed on my campus. That plan got a little bit fucked up by Covid, but I still intent to do it as soon as campus reopens. Where are you located? Maybe you could do something similar."

communism,fmmwxpg,t3_fvo52i,1586213656.0,"I was reading about the Green revolution in the 70s for my global food systems class and it talked about how the more productive crop strains and advanced technology sharply reduced rural poverty and hunger in Asia but aggravated it in Latin America. It said this was because poor small farm owners actually owned their land in Asia whereas in Latin America they didn't and were beholden to large landlords. The wealth this created for rural farmowners was shared with non-landowning farm laborers whose wages increased as demand for their labor increased, due to the intensity of modern agriculture. Obviously a huge number of those rural farmers were Chinese, with it being the largest and most populous Asian country, so I think we have the great leap forward to thank for that, since otherwise those peasants would not have owned their land and fared similarly to their Latin American counterparts."
