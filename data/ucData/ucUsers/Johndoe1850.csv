I came from nothing, worked my ass off and if all goes well will be retired and comfortable at 45. Not a jet setting lifestyle but comfortable. Stories like these always lift my mood. We need more of them right now."
UCDavis,fnilp2q,t3_g1zque,1586982166.0,Everything happens for a reason. Feel free to shoot me a chat if you need to talk.
indieheads,fngbbjp,t1_fng7dm4,1586927146.0,"I totally hear what you are saying. Except all of the local venues I go to don’t use Ticketmaster. Being in the Bay Area, most local venues use eventbrite or brown paper ticket. The only venues that I know of that use Ticketmaster or Live Nation are the same ones who charge 15 bucks for a tall can and 10 buck for chips and cheese that they call Nachos. So you will have to excuse the fact that I don’t tear up for these venues. As really most of them are greedy ass corporations, that don’t pay their workers shit and rip people off to see a show or game (ie Chase Center, Levi Stadium and Shorline). So you won’t see my crying and as always the show will go on. Maybe consumers will have a fighting chance when the Phoenix of big money shows rides from the ashes of COVID. That is my only point. Treat people fairly."

Seems like little to nothing has changed."
indieheads,fng4h2m,t1_fndj0z2,1586922105.0,"So let me get your analysis straight. You hire me to fix your roof. But instead my roof blows off during a storm. So I used the materials and money you paid me to fix my roof instead. I then quietly change my policy that says once you pay me, if my roof blows off during a storm. I have the right to use your materials to fix my roof. So please don’t ask for a refund, since the storm exclusion applied. I hope you understand and just forget that I used your shingles for my roof and never fixed yours.

Oh yes by the way. Many roofing companies had their roof blown off during the storm. It is going to take months for all the communities to recover. So a lot of roofing companies that don’t have good customer service, will probably go under by the time everything is over."
StockMarket,fng2ze8,t1_fnftgtv,1586921107.0,It is exhausting. What we do know is no one knows what the market is doing. The world has never been on lockdown like this before. Closest thing we have to compare it to would be a world war. But the economies are vastly different now. So I say be like the Oracle. When others get greedy get scared. When others get scared get greedy. I think we are somewhere in the middle right now.
