engineering,foqnnfi,t1_fopnpka,1587997408.0,"> The reason why bridges arenâ€™t collapsing left and right isnâ€™t because of the rigor and licensure, and education. Itâ€™s because weâ€™ve gotten really good at doing it over the last couple thousand years and have developed good standards for it.

If only there was some way of spreading that historical knowledge and enforcing its compliance. Almost like education and licensure."

AskEngineers,fo5qth2,t1_fo4pw29,1587532860.0,"Design engineer here. The reason is almost always that management doesn't see value in serviceability and therefore I spend zero time on it. If people want serviceable cars, they should start buying serviceable cars. But alas, when consumers buy cars, they *say* they want serviceability but don't actually buy serviceable cars. Blame consumers."

SantaBarbara,fnpm65k,t1_fnp10nq,1587147939.0,"I know you think this is a joke, but I personally don't find people asphyxiating from pneumonia funny nor do I think relating this situation to the systematic genocide of millions is anywhere near on point. It sounds like you lack the maturity to take serious events seriously, and I'd recommend that if you decide not to grow up, that at least you keep your locker room jokes separate from your business.

I bought my first gun, an ar-15 from your store in 2015ish and a handgun relatively soon after. I've stopped by and bought ammo dozens of other times. It's a great store and everyone seems friendly.

I'll be going to another store for my next purchase. Guns are deadly weapons and I'd prefer to get them from someone who doesn't view death lightly."
