1. .06 seconds is definitely noticeable.

2. You don't use it on something like a Jaguar, you use in on a Gauss Saw. It is 200% noticeable there, and hilarious.

>If both you and the enemy take longer than 0.06 seconds to react to each other's presence, you already forewent the bonus.

This doesn't make sense, it means you are giving up X seconds from being slow; but it doesn't mean the Y seconds from athlete don't matter.
