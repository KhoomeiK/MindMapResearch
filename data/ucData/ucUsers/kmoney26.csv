UCI,fpj94rf,t3_gdr4xl,1588660387.0,homie had helped me save so much money. why would somebody report this guy for doing a service for all students..
UCI,fp7ospn,t3_gbrgnm,1588374731.0,Hereâ€™s to hoping he gives tons of partial credit and curves fat. Def was hella hard
UCI,fp0566t,t1_fotho5z,1588202687.0,"the social situation is def what you make of it at UCI. as scorcher said, if you take the time to go out, join orgs, and make friends, you'll find parties on parties wherever you are. at the same time you can also go the other route and find tons of studious people to grind with. the UCI social scene isn't smack dab in your face like a lot of schools, but it is most definitely there. Just gotta go and get it rather than waiting for it to come to ya"
UCI,fowwyup,t3_g9wa3m,1588128951.0,I would do digging to see how hard it is to switch into chemistry at UCSB and UCI. after that i would try to dig up more on the social scene to see which one you vibe with more! both are great choices and congrats!
UCI,fosxnsj,t3_g95j4i,1588040209.0,"Also a second year MSE, I love the class sizes, since you get to know people and make a lot of friends since you move through the MSE series together. Also, a cool thing about our program is that we can pick a concentration in electrical, bio materials, or mechanical which I think truly represents the interdisciplinary nature of MSE!"

UCI,foa0nmr,t3_g69y0h,1587636654.0,"have friends at both UCR and UCSC and they both are doing extremely well in terms of career and academics. If you're trying to get into tech, I would say Santa Cruz because it is closer to the Bay area so more opportunities are bound to come knocking your way."
UCI,fnurpbo,t3_g40xfn,1587269341.0,"People switch between the two all the time. You'll just have to fulfill the requirements found at changeofmajor.uci.edu and then apply through the portal found on Student Access. No interview/essay needed. Also the application is simply indicating what majors you're trying to switch between. Since you're an incoming freshman, I would also try emailing UCI through your freshman portal and also ask about them potentially switching you into mechanical engineering before coming to school as I have heard they do that sometimes. Otherwise, be sure to also ask at spop because i've heard some schools allow switches of major within their school. If both fail, then fulfill the requirements and you're all good!! 

Good luck!"
UCI,fnkdjj3,t3_g267ou,1587023071.0,"imagine your high school asb team but now with $2 million dollars (accrued through student fees) and with the power to distribute it to various clubs, organizations, resources, events, and more across campus. 

I think the primary difference between high school ASB and ASB at college is that ASB at college can create tangible change at a much wider scale, as shown by the amount of funding that they have to distribute/move around. As a result, when they make decisions that don't reflect the students who voted for them, it is felt throughout the entire UCI community on a macroscopic scale. 

Contrary to highschool asb, if left unchecked, ASUCI can essentially do anything with our funds and with 2 million dollars that can be a enormous impact. This year a lot of questionable decisions were made by members by ASUCI which drew much attention to our ASUCI elections. 

Asuci elections dont usually get this crazy LMFAO"
UCI,fnkcmef,t3_g26z70,1587022131.0,how?? kinda interested in doing it now

UCI,fnap5ez,t3_g0czus,1586801362.0,Make sure to talk to them at spop too because they sometimes allow major switches within schools! Also make sure to keep in frequent touch with your counselor along with everything stayed above!
UCI,fmau7yx,t1_fmapx75,1585908022.0,That's super interesting because my year Mesa Court was definitely more social than Middle Earth by miles
