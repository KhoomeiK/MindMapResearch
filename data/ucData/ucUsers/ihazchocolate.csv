UCSC,fn41m3b,t3_fys92s,1586632216.0,"If you want a little social but not to the point of partying I would recommend 9/10. If you want to be around other compsci majors Crown has the most engineering majors, I really enjoyed crown but it definitely lives up to being one of the least social colleges. Definitely join the clubs that you may be interested in you can make some great friends/connections that way."
