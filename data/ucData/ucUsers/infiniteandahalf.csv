ucla,fpiszvc,t1_fpirhpa,1588648032.0,"ASUCLA Comms has a budget but they do not go to the USAC council for all their funding. The editor in chief is usually chosen internally by members of Daily Bruin, and last year there was a bit of drama when the [Comms Board](https://dailybruin.com/2019/04/12/after-strike-daily-bruin-staffers-meet-with-communications-board/) chose to appoint a different person...DB writers greatly value their independence from council, and I'm personally familiar with the Opinion section. I seriously doubt there's underhanded stuff going on with the endorsements. They put them out every year after sitting down with each person who runs for council. Transcripts are a good idea though! I'd like to see that.

As for written statements, Election Board is required to put those on your online ballot, so there is a place for people to view those. Most candidates have social media where that can be found too"

The student newspaper is managed by ASUCLA communications, but has a number of departments like sports, entertainment, campus politics, etc. It's very similar to how the new york times would endorse a candidate for president. An expression of opinion yes, but voters still need to vote"

I am out of the USAC space but this is a provision that did not exist when I was active, maybe in the midst of everything being online now turnout will be up but the special election in fall had <10% turnout iirc"
