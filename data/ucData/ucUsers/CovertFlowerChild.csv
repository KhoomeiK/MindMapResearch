UCIConfessions,forc0kv,t3_g92otf,1588009669.0,"Im 27, had a coworker who was 20 years older than me. We worked at my old community college. She turned EVERYTHING into a competition: stress, achievement, school, parenting, money. To the point where she would always contradict herself. I could never express my stress because hers was way worse. I couldn‚Äôt talk about my achievements because ‚Äúif i was her age I would have struggled‚Äù or ‚ÄúI had way more help than she did.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt express my concerns as a parent because ‚Äúi have all the help in the world,‚Äù when in fact i didnt. I couldnt talk about my shitty family because her family was from hell.  I quit back in November of last year. For a few months she would constantly text me to ‚Äúcheck up on me,‚Äù but it was more on the lines of making sure I wasn‚Äôt doing better than her on her weird ass competitions. I had enough of her and told her a crazy ass story saying i was enrolled in 20 units, without childcare, with no job, paying a crazy amount of rent, still having a good amount of money saved, having a good amount of FAFSA left over, still managing to get good grades, idk whatever would piss her off. She hasn‚Äôt texted me since."
