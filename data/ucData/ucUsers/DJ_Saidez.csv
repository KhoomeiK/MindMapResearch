AskReddit,fp0v0so,t3_gamg4j,1588217546.0,"It depends on the second and third languages

My first language was Spanish, then I moved to the United States at age 7 with pretty much no English knowledge. Through language development classes and complete immersion, I was designated as sufficiently fluent (compared to peers) when I was 9. It wasn't so difficult once I got the hang of it, and now my teachers say that I'm better at it than many natives my age (came at the cost of effective command of Spanish)

My third language is Japanese. Self-taught. I don't have any in-person language partners. I've been at it for less than a year. I suck at it.

Japanese is much harder to learn for Spanish-speakers than Italian, and for English-speakers than Norwegian, due to the vast differences. And because of the lack of immersion, I'd say it's harder than when I learned English.

However, I'd say having the 2nd language learning experience does open the door to additional languages, since your brain is already used to working in more than one language"
