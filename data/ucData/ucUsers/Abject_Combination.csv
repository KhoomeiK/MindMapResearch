FragileWhiteRedditor,fplo10k,t1_fplne6h,1588716212.0,What do you get out of this? You can't properly defend your argument. I don't disagree with getting a degree in gender studies. I believe that you should be prepared to do something useful with it or learn something with it in order to contribute to society. The football coach makes money for the college.
berkeley,fpllg2f,t1_fpll2a1,1588714841.0,He didn’t even say bleach. He also suggested they look into it—still mind numbingly stupid don’t get me wrong. People are straight up lying about drinking/injecting bleach.

FragileWhiteRedditor,fpljli4,t1_fpljc0z,1588713875.0,"I wasn’t countering any argument, nor do I want an “engagement.” I just suggested double majoring and you’re pissed about it for no reason. Is there anything wrong with what I said?"
berkeley,fplirgj,t1_fplf7no,1588713450.0,"Also, looking through your post history, I’m genuinely curious why you think Trump suggested we inject bleach. Don’t get me wrong, that press conference was extremely stupid and short-sighted, but why lie to make him seem worse? He’s bad enough as it stands."
berkeley,fpligo7,t1_fplf7no,1588713294.0,"That may be true, but you’re arguing that this post is racist when it’s not. You’re the one who’s putting race into this."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fpli8wq,t1_fplfxa8,1588713183.0,"Dude it’s a thread. I’m not trying to hijack anything; you’re obviously free to comment on others’ ideas as well. I just think it’s irresponsible to spend thousands of dollars to work towards a degree that will not give you return on your investment. There are plenty of resources online to learn about these highly specific fields like gender studies. You were trying to discount these as mere “Medium” blogs. At least in the U.S., college is extremely expensive—especially for liberal arts. Studying a practical major ALONGSIDE a major you’re interested in makes more sense to me."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fpldayl,t1_fplanhf,1588710663.0,You can learn with 1 major and have another major as a backup. What’s wrong with that?
FragileWhiteRedditor,fpl9a9i,t1_fpkwt9e,1588708626.0,Which is why I said you can double major...
FragileWhiteRedditor,fpkwabk,t1_fpkvqtf,1588702140.0,There are plenty of reputable resources on the internet to learn. I personally believe it is foolish to major in one of these highly specific subjects for future job prospects. It's better to double major with something more readily applicable unless you're 100% positive on going to grad school.

I'm just saying that it's difficult for some—if not most—students to afford dropping thousands of dollars, even if it's only for a few schools. It sucks to pay that much and not receive an acceptance. Also, for the record, I don't go to an Ivy."
premed,fpiv6u1,t1_fpius1e,1588649473.0,"In undergrad admissions, interviews are conducted regionally. Granted, these are alumni interviews and are not very important.

This will obviously save money and time."
premed,fpii11n,t3_gdntqz,1588641324.0,"Why aren't interviews online every year? I understand that in-person events are more engaging, but spending thousands of dollars with no guarantee of a spot is very hard for some people."
