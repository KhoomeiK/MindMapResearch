UCSantaBarbara,fpmyzzx,t1_fpmu32e,1588745448.0,You’re fine; a lot of people (including myself) don’t take Econ 1 until winter quarter anyway!
UCSantaBarbara,fpmsrxv,t3_geddno,1588740753.0,"Hm, if I were you, I would probably wait. Econ 1 isn’t necessarily a very difficult course (especially in hindsight) but doing well in it definitely takes a high degree of focus and self-motivation because it requires a lot of practice. While you may already have that, it seems like it would be harder to be super productive if you’re remote. 

It’s 100% possible to do well in it remotely or to not do well and redeem yourself but I’ve seen with some of my friends that getting a good start with Econ 1 can be really important. It can be really stressful if you do poorly in Econ 1 and have to ace Econ 2 and 10A to get into the major. If you can do relatively well in Econ 1 (B+/A-/A), you’ll save yourself a lot of headache later.

Also, for me, in-person resources like section, CLAS and study groups were useful for Econ 1."
UCSantaBarbara,fplzzko,t1_fplzaho,1588722776.0,"Yeah, but 93% of dorm residents and 65% of university-owned apartments residents chose to move out because of remote instruction. So, if classes are hybrid remote/in-person with the choice to be fully remote, I think a lot of people would take it and cancel their contracts.

UCSantaBarbara,fphq0a8,t3_gdjgqr,1588625696.0,"I think it’s really hard to answer this question with any degree of certainty at this point. Other UCs have indicated that they’re planning to do a hybrid remote/in-person quarter and the UCs usually tend to be consistent in strategy across the system, so I’m assuming that UCSB is also planning to do in-person for now.

Also, 60k would be for the entire year and includes housing, no? We pay per quarter. So, if you were at home (not paying for housing) and fall quarter was online, it’d actually be more like 14k.

And it’s up to you, but I echo the other commenter’s point that it may not be wise to make a 4-year decision off of what happens for a 3-month period."

Econ 171 with Esponda might be a good class to look into for an elective; it’s not easy but it’s graded very generously and really fun. Also, you can do the problem sets in groups of up to 5 and there are no midterms. Probably my favorite class I’ve taken here!"
UCSantaBarbara,fp7blsx,t1_fp76nms,1588367570.0,"All over social media usually and you’ll see a lot of flyers in coffee shops and other stores around IV.

There’s a number of houses that are kind of “known” for holding a lot of house shows and some of them have their own Instagram pages where they post events. Also, finding some bands in IV on Instagram and following them is a good idea because they’ll post about upcoming gigs and most shows will have 4-5 acts so you’ll find more bands/people through that!

It’s a little hard to tell you exactly which bands or houses to look up, because those kind of shift year to year, but some popular ones that are on Instagram would be @extremophiles_, @jakobakira, @closeoutofficial, @pretty.cheeky and @tastegoodiv."

UCSantaBarbara,fp4n7z3,t1_fp4h0ls,1588302758.0,"Hello! This may not be a helpful answer, but I just wanted to note that the intro/beginning classes for these majors will be very similar so you will be taking the same classes for these majors anyway for your first few quarters. I would suggest not stressing too much about this choice right now; you'll be able to make a better informed decision if you wait to get to campus and speak to professors, advisors and other pre-med students."
UCSantaBarbara,fp46ndc,t1_fp40tp1,1588292744.0,"Quite a bit of an extrapolation to take one intro class and use it to speak to the whole department, no? Also, when you're noting financial aid as a solid point of UCLA, the Promise Scholarship at UCSB is literally a full ride."
UCSantaBarbara,fp46f7p,t1_fp1i60a,1588292616.0,"Regents is definitely a plus; priority registration is so useful and the cost factor is great. In addition, you'll have access to greater research, leadership and faculty interaction opportunities. Also, you'll just generally receive preferential treatment from admin and faculty, in a lot of cases. 

It's hard to ignore the prestige of UCLA though; as great as UCSB is academically, it's missing the reputation factor that UCSB provides. I personally turned down schools with a ""better"" ranking/reputation in order to go to UCSB because I thought UCSB was where I could experience the most personal growth. It's a special place. I am also planning on going to graduate school, so I knew my undergrad degree wasn't as important, even though UCSB has a good name, and I wanted to save money for that.

Reputation is a factor to consider for sure, but if that's one of the only factors driving you to UCLA over UCSB, I would tread carefully. UCLA has more of a city vibe, while UCSB is definitely more nature-y. UCSB is also a little more laidback and has less traditional school spirit than UCLA. If you work hard, you can be successful no matter which school you go to."
UCSantaBarbara,fp19ht8,t1_foxgmtg,1588228324.0,"Hey! It's hard to say whether this is enough because it really depends on how good your study habits. As an econ/math major, which is probably similar to stats and data science, I usually have lecture 2-3 hours a day. Outside of that, I'll probably spend 5-6 hours studying or doing homework."

I get that it didn’t work out for you and I’m glad you found something that works better for you, but I don’t think that’s a true statement for everyone and I don’t think it’s something to dissuade someone about when it comes to going to this school."
UCSantaBarbara,fp0s4zk,t1_fp057fq,1588215708.0,"Undeclared is good because there's a strong variety of classes and majors! I would recommend looking at a list of majors and at least narrowing down what you know you *don't* want to do. Then, look up the course catalogs for the majors you haven't eliminated (e.g. UCSB sociology course catalog) and pick a few lower division classes that sound interesting. Talk to your professors about their experiences and work hard in your classes; you don't want to mistake not liking a subject for not putting in enough effort to succeed.

I don't recommend listening to the other person who commented here; don't go to a university just because you have a major there when you don't actually know what you want to major in. Switching to majors within L&S is easy, for the most part."
UCSantaBarbara,fp0rgqf,t1_fp0jlg7,1588215288.0,"It's very easy to switch majors within colleges, Letters & Science! If you're interested in doing that major or something similar, I would recommend switching to it before you arrive to campus. You can always switch to something else and you'll have better registration priority for classes you need for that major. What I mean by that is that some classes are closed off to only the people who are required to take that class during the first round of picking courses, so if you're undeclared, there may be less ""first round"" classes for you."

I definitely think this class lacks transparency and accountability; it feels unnecessarily rigid during such a rough time. Lectures are so long and don’t really cover much, in my opinion..."
UCSantaBarbara,foweoer,t1_fow71b4,1588118309.0,"Yeah, I completely agree with how bland this class is. It bothers me that she doesn’t hold office hours at all and hasn’t responded to emails I’ve sent. I feel like I’m getting nothing out of this class.

I haven’t seen her defense, but honestly, I didn’t think it was unclear because the slide before said “growth will continue until the economy reaches a steady-state.” This made me think that growth stops after the economy reaches a steady-state, so the economy being on the left side of the steady-state was what made sense. Just my thought.

On the plus side, I think other professors in the department are working hard to create engaging and useful content."

One of my good friends is CCS math and she said that everyone would work through homework together in the lounges because they were all in the same classes, so it was a collaborative, friendly and intellectually stimulating place to live. 

On the other hand, living in Santa Cruz or Anacapa might give you the chance to meet people outside of CCS who you would not have run into at UCSB otherwise.

Both places would be social and fun places to live, though I know less about Pendola. Maybe you can get in touch with CCS and ask if they can connect you to some current students who you can ask?"

Now, students from low-income backgrounds likely have a considerably worse shot at getting into the major compared to the many middle-class and wealthy students at UCSB who have nice homes/work spaces, good internet, family that supports and understands the value of education, etc. On campus, it’s competitive but fair.

Also, compared to SD, there are way fewer grad students so it’s generally easier to get research opportunities — definitely true in my case.

I have a great work/life balance! Having a really beautiful natural environment helps with that. It’s also a very friendly and social school. I’d say I usually try to do all of my work on campus during the day and then relax when I go home in the evening. There’s a lot of fun outdoorsy stuff, like great hiking, surfing, biking, rock climbing, etc., which is something I do with a lot of my free time. Several clubs are geared toward this so even if you’re not big on it, there’s a lot of ways to try it out! There are generally many events going on on-campus at any given time to pick from. People go to parties or house shows (bands) in Isla Vista. There’s a cool downtown Santa Barbara area and great day trips you can take. Food is okay. Dorms are good, for the most part. 

I was really attracted to the sense of community here. Some campuses I visited felt like everyone was on their own and absorbed in their own bubble.

UCSB is ranked higher, has a better reputation, and is significantly more selective with admissions; while this shouldn’t make your decision, you might consider how this affects the people you’ll be networking with. Also, UCSB is awesome and offers a wonderful college experience. I doubt you’ll feel like you’re missing out just because sports aren’t huge.

I don’t know if I think there should be enforcement, but I think people should stop being irresponsible and selfish. Yes, it sucks that you have to stay inside, but it’s what’s the most socially conscious and considerate decision right now.

I’m in another part of California where it really feels kind of apocalyptic when you go outside and it’s barren. Everyone is wearing masks, keeping their heads down as they pass, staying away from people on the street, etc. I don’t expect people in IV to go this far but at least showing some restraint would be preferable; it makes me upset to hear that there were 100+ people at Sands.

You can make a to-do list for every class and add due dates. You can move things to a done list and you can click for a calendar view. The items on the list also change colors when it’s closer to the date and you can set it up so it sends you email remainders a day or two before a due date. I put everything from all of my syllabi on at the beginning of the quarter and it’s been great for organization. I also try to “self-assign” due dates e.g. I’ll add a due date for a reading even though there’s not technically one.

It’s flexible, organized and fun to look at. It honestly motivates me to finish things so I can drag it over to my done list. Every day, I’ll tag items to do tomorrow, so I know what I want to accomplish each day. I also usually do chunks of very focused work offset with breaks. This is a helpful method:

And an online timer I use with it: https://tomato-timer.com/

My last tip is that I’ve found it really useful to get contact info of people in my class and say “let’s do a Zoom call on Monday to talk about the homework.” Then, I’ll be a lot more motivated to get it done because I’ll feel a greater responsibility than just to myself."

I also have a professor who has assigned way more work than the class usually has, uploads lectures that are considerably longer than they would be in-person and refuses to answer emails on their personal address (but ignores emails sent to the class email they set up, including one about a technology access problem I have that I sent 12 days ago and have followed up on). They also don't. hold office hours. But they do pre-recorded lectures so they make it impossible to contact them. 

So, yeah, the chaos is not something they could have foreseen and I am cutting my professors a lot of slack. I love most of my professors and am not judging them for problems they're having. But the second kind of professor, who consciously makes life harder for students during a global pandemic because we ""have more free time""? That's who this meme is about lol."
UCSantaBarbara,fn1dsf1,t3_fya9h8,1586559926.0,"I also had a really tough time throughout my fall and winter quarter of freshman year. I felt like everyone else was best friends and it was too late for me to make friends. I almost transferred out of UCSB. Like you, I was super involved in fall and winter!

In spring quarter, however, I unexpectedly met some people I clicked with in a class for my major. Then, in my second year, I became a lot more involved in a club that I joined in freshman year and started hanging out with people outside of the context of the club. Now, as a third year, I'm so happy with the friends I have. I think at a certain point, the best friendships come when you're not looking for them. I would recommend continuing to put yourself out there and being proactive; if you meet someone cool, follow up with them and make fun plans rather than waiting for something to happen or for them to reach out to you! Also, be willing to be open and vulnerable so that they feel comfortable doing the same. Finally, go with the flow and say ""yes"" as much as you can. Don't stress about it and spend this time learning more about yourself and what you like to do.

It's sad that spring is gone but you still have 3 years! There's way more time to go than it feels like :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fmynt5u,t1_fmycxjy,1586490759.0,"Yeah, that’s true. For me though, I was planning to take classes and to have an on-campus job. If classes are online, I don’t really want to take out loans for that and I probably won’t have an on-campus job anymore. So financially, my best option is to live at home rent-free and get a job here."
UCSantaBarbara,fmwnvc5,t3_fxvj62,1586449916.0,"So we’re probably headed the same direction, which makes sense and which I know is for the best, so I’m not mad or upset.

Just a little disappointed because this was going to be the first and only summer I spend in IV during my time at UCSB and I was really looking forward to it."
UCSantaBarbara,fmlk518,t1_fmkslxz,1586187996.0,"Downtown Santa Barbara is fun! There’s a lot of shops and good restaurants there. There are some good music venues too. Also, in addition to the beach, we’re right next to the mountains and there is great hiking, camping, rock climbing, etc. In IV, there are house band shows, which are super cool, and other places that will hold community events, like the Biko House. IV also has restaurants and some shops. The campus is always hosting a huge variety of events as well. Also, this isn’t on campus, but there are some awesome day trips you can do from Santa Barbara. There’s definitely always fun stuff to do outside of class; I wouldn’t worry about being bored here, especially because you’ll probably be spending more time than you think on school!"
UCSantaBarbara,fmkj6vv,t3_fvta83,1586156784.0,"Gosh, I miss this so much, I literally teared up a little watching this. On the other hand, I’m glad I’ve been lucky enough to spend so much time in such a beautiful place and hope to remember the feeling I have now to take greater advantage of it in the future :)

Thank you for sharing!"
UCSantaBarbara,fmk40dv,t1_fmk3hbx,1586144001.0,"I’m not saying that’s what I think it should be lol. But I think the university’s policy during this time is that a decision made about P/NP should be universal across the department, and not apply differently to different classes. I don’t think that what the economics department is doing is right; I’m just saying that I don’t think the department thinks they’re going to trick us about the university’s updated policy on P/NP, as the original comment here interpreted it"
