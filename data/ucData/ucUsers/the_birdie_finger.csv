berkeley,folostv,t3_g81tsj,1587866974.0,My English professor who attended LA for undergraduate and Berkeley for her PhD said the latter has an incredible English department. She told me that Berkeley was by far her best college experience and highly recommends it for English majors.

YES THE CLAPPING HANDS. Those hands are no joke hahaha"

I'm still pissed about it 6 years later lmao"
berkeley,fo3zlpn,t1_fo3ytwt,1587495651.0,"Wow, that's crazy haha. You are also transferring from LAPC?

In terms of newer media, I absolutely adore Hereditary and The Conjuring. I also, controversially, think the Evil Dead remake is superior to the original. 

Horror video games are interesting too. In fact, I was watching the Silent Hills PT demo for like the thousandth time this morning. 

How about you?"
berkeley,fo3mx1c,t3_g5hni6,1587489576.0,"Major: Political Science/Data Science Minor (hopefully)

Transferring from: LAPC

Random: uhh lived in the same one-bedroom apartment since I was born"
cscareerquestions,fo1z977,t1_fo1z7nz,1587445178.0,But it is a minor. Do you think employers would look down upon this?
cscareerquestions,fo1yyu7,t1_fo1yvfx,1587444961.0,This is the reassurance I needed. Time to dive in headfirst.
PoliticalScience,fo1xng7,t1_fo1ccl4,1587443972.0,Can I ask what role you work?
ApplyingToCollege,fo0ly6r,t1_fo0anla,1587415508.0,Haha yes. I got in.
ApplyingToCollege,fnxywdk,t3_g4hd0x,1587349401.0,"So I was just admitted as a transfer student and my family is adamant about me going there. They've come to the point of completely dismissing UCLA, assuming I can get in, and I'm honestly not sure if Berkeley is the right fit for me. 

I get that it has the ""prestige"", and while I don't like to admit it, the name does carry substantial weight. I guess my question is what should I expect from the campus and the generally, the students/culture?"

ApplyingToCollege,fnk7fba,t1_fnk5poc,1587017248.0,Don't apologize! Totally a valid question.
ApplyingToCollege,fnk49hl,t1_fnk16m8,1587014521.0,Thanks! I was going to but I had a lot of family-related stuff to deal with. :( Wish I could've though.
ApplyingToCollege,fnk0g94,t1_fnjyeqm,1587011480.0,"Yes, of course!"
ApplyingToCollege,fnk0e75,t1_fnjykqj,1587011437.0,"I believe test scores no longer are required for the UCs. You do have to submit them for privates, but I do they think they are not weighted as much for transfers. That said, if the score(s) are on the lower on the scale, then retaking them is an option. Better scores, nonetheless, make for a better application. 

As for me, I'm actually considering choosing UCSD over a UCB or UCLA assuming I'll be admitted to all three (huge emphasis on the assuming). Admittedly, prestige does matter to me-- albeit it might be given my parents are adamant about Berkeley's prestige over other factors (i.e., fit, mental health). I do see how attending Berkeley may very well be an advantage if I do apply for graduate school or overall, looking for jobs. 

Are you thinking about the transfer route? I'm more than willing to give you some tips if you want!"
ApplyingToCollege,fnjvcwi,t3_g1as53,1587007872.0,"I'm a political science major and/or data science. I applied to UCB, UCLA, UCSD, UCI, Pomona College, and Williams College.

So far, I've been admitted to Irvine with regents and the honors program. I also was waitlisted by Pomona and rejected by Williams.

EDIT: Got into Berkeley!"
ApplyingToCollege,fnjv4qb,t1_fniy5xj,1587007717.0,"Generally, stellar transcripts are obviously substantial, however, extracurriculars still matter as a transfer. I think there is a misconception that transfers only need to maintain a certain GPA and that will ensure admission to a decent school. I'd argue otherwise since the more competitive universities (i.e., Pomona College, Williams College, Ivy's) want to see, similarly to freshmen, what is being done outside of school. Even with scholarships, like Jack Kent Cooke, grades are crucial, but even more so are the personal attributes and record of serving your field of interest or generally, volunteering, interning, etc for causes that matter to you."

Unemployment,fncca7f,t1_fncc2hu,1586833319.0,I have been on unemployment before and that card has since expired. I do have it still though. I hope it comes this week.

I am wondering why I have not received my debit card yet. I thought it might be because I said I was NOT looking for work, however, why would my status say that I was paid otherwise? Thanks."

Unemployment,fnc9cxa,t1_fnc7u1k,1586831448.0,"It just lists the two dates I mentioned in the previous comment as paid. 

And how do I get in contact with BoA? Do I just get in contact with anyone because their EDD line requires a debit card number?"
Unemployment,fnc7obd,t1_fnc7g1y,1586830385.0,"Mine says that I was paid for the weeks ending on 03/21 and 03/28. It already says they are both paid and every time I call them, I get redirected to an automated system and the call hangs up. I don't know what to do anymore."
Unemployment,fnc720t,t3_fzg4f9,1586830002.0,"Hey, when did you your first pay date end? I think I messed by certifying that I did NOT look for work, however, it still says that I was paid for the period ending on 03/38. I haven't even received my card yet since I was supposedly paid. :("
Unemployment,fnc6w2y,t1_fnc6n4d,1586829900.0,I still haven't received my card though. I don't know what's going on-- this is getting super out of hand.
