ucla,fnxwm0o,t3_g4fmzd,1587347911.0,"Can you please DM your email? A student who IS being bullied by USAC students, including being bullied by Robert, may want to email you. I know a gentleman who has screenshots and has USAC recording spots from the YouTube page on where you can hear Robert taking advantage of student body president. The woman being accused of being a racist (she’s not, she said “cuh” to Johana) that is getting cyberbullied has a screenshot where Robert states he loves being UCLA’s USAC president because he can get students expelled. DM me! I’m sure this can help. Keep in mind these students sent all the tweets, comments and posts to the deans at UCLA."

ucla,fnkdmtn,t1_fngdtfb,1587023165.0,She is cyberbullying a student and calling a student racist. The student said the word “cuh” on a comment Joana posted. Joana is just as guilty too
ucla,fnkdd44,t1_fnitxn7,1587022885.0,"He only abstained, which is respectable. But there was no need to use verbal harassment and no need to imply he’s a racist. In fact from what I’m hearing USAC members are accusing someone for being anti black for using the word “cuh.” They just have nothing better to do. I’m black and mexican and cuh isn’t insulting"
