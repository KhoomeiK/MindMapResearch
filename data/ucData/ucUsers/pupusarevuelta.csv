PS4,fpj4pb0,t1_fpj3evb,1588656532.0,Yes it’s connected to the PS4 via the Sony USB cable used to sync controllers to the PS4.
ucr,foo9f5w,t3_g8l5g6,1587935049.0,I’m also taking 4 classes during the summer but it’s my first time so I don’t know how bad it will be. I had the same question about the summer financial aid application and after emailing them they told me to submit a new application with the right number of units I’m enrolled in so they have it up to date.

ucr,fnxzc6r,t3_g4i3zw,1587349699.0,Same thing happened to me last year and when I emailed them they said an option to accept the award would be available sometime in July.

ucr,fn8vijw,t3_g0ast7,1586751356.0,"I feel the exact same way...this quarantine had me looking back at how I haven’t experienced anything that a typical college student talks about, I haven’t even made friends while living on campus. Next quarter is my last one at UCR and I’m scared it’s going to be the same. It sucks seeing my friends from high school living their best life in college with all their new friends and I’m still stuck in the same spot."

ucr,fmmjyf6,t3_fw22qb,1586206643.0,Will both sessions be asynchronous? I believe there’s a 2 in the CRN’s instead of a 3 or at least that’s what’s coming up for me.
ucr,fmie9j0,t3_fupfaw,1586107845.0,I went on Sunday to pick up some stuff from my room in Plaza and I was surprised to see a TAPS worker checking for parking permits. This was on 3/29 so I’m not sure if they’re still doing that.
