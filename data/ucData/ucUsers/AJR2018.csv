MortalKombat,fn55qpz,t3_fza9zr,1586656574.0,"MK has a weak foundation when it comes the non American demographic like asians

They should honestly get (pay/sponsor) a or multiple pro asain player(s) who plays things like tekken SF or smash to draw in players from other demographics who haven't really given MK a chance especially considering the balance of this game relative to something like MKX"

UCSantaBarbara,fn0tzzq,t1_fn0tgpk,1586548712.0,"Maybe switch carriers? ahaa idk I have T-mobile personally I would try to create the enviroment I need rather than quit altogether

I'm using the money I would have spent on rent at school as productive as possible, I bought a desk computer chair and a screen to use miracast on since I have no Wi-Fi and upgraded my phone plan, put some money into rent here at home and boxed up my ps4 so I'm not tempted to play it"
UCSantaBarbara,fn0t3ab,t1_fn0s16c,1586548214.0,"Why not just change your plan to a higher tier just for this quarter?

I'm paying for unlimited 4G LTE on my phone for this quarter only. And it comes with 3Gb of relatively quick hotspot so I can use my laptop too and also my carrier is giving 10gb of hotspot on top of that for free  because of the coronavirus situation so 13gb hotspot total, I haven't even used 1Gb for reference and we're 2 weeks in

I do all streaming like Zoom, Netflix, youtube videos for classes and TA and such on my phone while miracasting it to my bigger screen I use for studying

All studying stuff like gauchospace, powerpoints, kindle books, research, essay, I use hotspot on my laptop 

The system works for me haha"
