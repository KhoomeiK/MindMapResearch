UCSC,fpmjdlh,t1_fplk588,1588734361.0,Disagree. The designs have been good and it seems like enough people who CARE are participating.
UCSC,fpebiwl,t1_fpdbv3a,1588544223.0,I don‚Äôt know how I could‚Äôve passed without a curve. She did have that weird policy that if you got a B on the final you‚Äôd pass the class no matter what your previous score so maybe that saved me? Idk.
UCSC,fp8lzcd,t3_gbl9t5,1588395890.0,I relate to this hardcore. I feel like I work so hard and end up getting a 65 while my peers put in minimal studying time and get an 86... I just don‚Äôt get it.
UCSC,fp2k5g8,t1_fp1a0w3,1588263144.0,I was afraid of that lol
UCSC,fp2jdt5,t1_fp1i2hi,1588262768.0,Omg this is such a nice offer!! Thank you so much. PM me üòä
UCSC,fp13l3j,t1_fp13gqz,1588223458.0,Oh! I had no idea! I thought they were equally common! Good to know thanks
UCSC,fp13he2,t3_gai1ol,1588223379.0,Not a tutor but I was the only one in my section today üòï
UCSC,fp13efx,t1_fp10g7u,1588223317.0,I‚Äôve heard python is easier to start with. What are the big differences between them? I‚Äôm doing a project for a class that‚Äôs in Java so that‚Äôs just what I went with
UCSC,fp13b6c,t1_fp0tx7o,1588223249.0,Because I am baby beginner and know nothing lol idk I thought people might think I‚Äôm dumb for wanting to start in it. Lots of people in this subreddit are CS or CSE majors and I have mad respect for what they do. Never thought I could even understand it tbh.
UCSC,fozjjaw,t3_ga1vqi,1588191724.0,He‚Äôs so great!
UCSC,fopp8a1,t1_fopovqe,1587967802.0,You should be good cuz SIR‚Äôs are usually due June 1st (irc) And no problem! Good luck with your studies! Santa Cruz is a pretty cool place to go!
UCSC,fopkl7d,t3_g8tkt6,1587963991.0,"I‚Äôve heard 115 and 120 aren‚Äôt too bad! I took 115L which was very straightforward (not easy, but not overbearing)"
UCSC,foo1e2u,t1_fokox3y,1587930590.0,Yes you can! They‚Äôll have you rank your college affiliation (doesn‚Äôt matter if your a transfer tbh) and then when you indicate on campus housing you‚Äôll get to rank your choices of floor theme. I ranked sub free as my top choice and I got it. I think it‚Äôs kind of unpopular because of SC‚Äôs reputation that most people like. So you‚Äôre likely to get it.
UCSC,folf7zz,t1_folepyo,1587860949.0,Thank you! Good luck to you!
UCSC,fok2ehp,t1_foiuptb,1587834119.0,"You would yes. 
Kresge (about 5-7 mins to science hill), 9/10 (5 min max) and Porter are probably closest to science hill. But as a transfer you would end up in the transfer community at Porter. Small chance of Cowell but most likely porter. It‚Äôs about a 10 min walk from porter to science hill."
UCSC,foivrfq,t1_foio5wn,1587798651.0,"Have you seen this subreddit? 80% of it is people asking for advice, the other 20% is split between complaining about CSE12 and memes."
UCSC,foivjbp,t3_g7mj2a,1587798433.0,An extremely vague memory just popped in my head. I think (THINK) your blue password is your student ID and then you set your final blue password. Unless they got rid of blue passwords in favor of the god awful MFA system.
UCSC,foi6pmf,t3_g7ik5i,1587779855.0,"The likelihood you would get an apartment on campus as a first year transfer is very low. Unless you‚Äôre >23 years old then there‚Äôs Redwood Grove. Personally, I‚Äôd recommend living on campus if you can afford to your first year. It really helps with connecting to the campus and takes a little bit of the stress out of moving since you‚Äôll have a room and furniture and whatnot. Source: Am Transfer (2018), wanted apartment, was shocked when apartment was not offered. Bonus! Porter has a Substance Free themed floor and it‚Äôs where I lived last year yay!"
UCSC,foi6cbx,t1_foi2vrh,1587779633.0,"Always interesting stuff when you get to that point but I‚Äôve definitely had some imposter syndrome in my major this year. Everyone seemed to understand it but me. Felt weird because my major has basically been my identity (one of them) for the last 4-5 years and then suddenly I was thinking I‚Äôm not even cut out for this. Yesterday my professor had a lecture and talked about birdsongs and their relation to neuronal plasticity and it clicked: I don‚Äôt not like neuroscience, I just don‚Äôt like having to memorize 1,000 molecules and mechanisms. Anyway, that‚Äôs my vent for now, thanks for anyone listening!"
UCSC,fogze8p,t3_g7cwt7,1587758744.0,I rediscovered that I actually do like neuroscience yesterday so that felt good.
UCSC,fodq3pv,t1_fo5u6gl,1587687991.0,"That‚Äôs my whole thing. I already have test anxiety just taking a test by myself, having someone watch me would send me over the edge. My friend said one time he was using it and his mom called him from another room and he turned his head to answer and ProctorU booted him from the quiz."
UCSC,fodo4fp,t3_g6gob6,1587687083.0,"Porter Pros: Nicer dorms space-wise, close enough to science hill and the quad is so nice in the spring. Lots of art if you‚Äôre into that! There‚Äôs a nice computer lab nearby that‚Äôs usually empty so it‚Äôs a good place to study! 
Cons: if you‚Äôre in porter A building you have to walk to B to do laundry (it‚Äôs not that big of a deal but some people might be turned off by it). The quad has some AMAZING acoustics which is fine and dandy until you can hear someone‚Äôs normal level conversation from the quad in your room on the 6th floor. Dining hall closes early on weekdays and is closed on weekends. Lastly, The Porter Call ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"
UCSC,fo3wmgt,t3_g52zhq,1587494186.0,I get them weekly
UCSC,fnjo9t4,t1_fnjo2y2,1587003218.0,There was a rumor that someone had tried to start a petition to make sure she doesn‚Äôt teach again. I never saw it but I would have signed it. Yeah if your mindset is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stuck here teaching you all‚Äù you should not be teaching at all.
UCSC,fnjl529,t1_fnine7e,1587001265.0,Yeah I remember her giving us a list!! Kinda dumb üôÉ
UCSC,fnikbm0,t3_g1xmvr,1586981483.0,I can‚Äôt even log into my bank account rn.
UCSC,fnik8ia,t3_g1yhcn,1586981440.0,Oof Braslau?? Good luck... flash cards and whiteboards are your friend. Personally if you have the option I‚Äôd take it another quarter.
UCSC,fnggqoo,t3_g1l1w3,1586931711.0,I don‚Äôt really drink and don‚Äôt use drugs or smoke and I was fine. A few of my friends smoke occasionally but it‚Äôs not like their life revolves around it. You‚Äôll definitely find like minded people. And as a transfer I lived on the sub free floor in the dorms and it was cool.
UCSC,fnfptad,t3_g1hr13,1586912944.0,Not sure if this is entirely correct but I‚Äôve heard you can do a BA in biology instead and the course load is a bit easier to keep a high GPA.
UCSC,fnbuhhb,t1_fnbs064,1586822566.0,Was that CSE3?
UCSC,fn5ucl5,t1_fn5dh6s,1586676181.0,That too!
UCSC,fn4sgxm,t1_fn4h2i6,1586647984.0,They don‚Äôt mention it anywhere which is dumb. I remember thinking I was gonna live in the cute lil RCC apartments. I feel like the school kinda beats around the subject for whatever reason. I think it took me calling the housing office to get a clear answer
UCSC,fn4b4ib,t3_fyyy73,1586637752.0,Just FYI if you‚Äôre a transfer and you live on campus you will most likely end up in the Transfer Community at Porter regardless of your affiliation. They never explicitly told me this so I was really confused.
UCSC,fn3s9sn,t3_fz0r2g,1586626924.0,"I‚Äôve enjoyed my time here as a transfer. I can see how Fall ‚Äò19 transfers (and freshman) probably have a bad taste in their mouth but this past academic year sucked for everyone, not just UCSC kids. I would recommend dorming. Overall the Porter dorms (where the transfer community is) are probably the best ones. You can walk to any dining hall and it makes connecting with the school and resources easier in your first year. Good luck!"
UCSC,fn28bsn,t1_fn279qk,1586580696.0,Oh boy
UCSC,fn1bk86,t3_fym2dy,1586558642.0,Also shoutout to Joseph Connell who is teaching for the first time ever!!! He‚Äôs such a nice guy and is doing everything that he can to help students understand the material.
UCSC,fn0v85c,t3_fydnzy,1586549394.0,P good. The pianos are nice enough and usually in tune. The only issue I had was hearing wind players practicing next to the room but I really didn‚Äôt mind because it reminded me of the good ol band kid days (sad)
UCSC,fn0v1j7,t3_fy9wuf,1586549291.0,Gerallllllldd
UCSC,fn0uw7w,t1_fn0pfzq,1586549207.0,I loved him when I took him üòä
UCSC,fn0uv0m,t3_fym2dy,1586549188.0,Tamkun for BIOL118! Giving us so many resources to help with the upcoming midterm
UCSC,fmupfkn,t3_fx3b8a,1586396057.0,"If you go to your optometrist they might be able to add a coating to filter blue light a bit more. I have it on my current prescription and I DEFINITELY notice a difference with the headaches (aka I don‚Äôt get any when I wear them). Idk what that person was saying about blue-light filters being placebo, but fake or not it helps me"
UCSC,fmuowma,t3_fxh078,1586395743.0,"Take it from someone who was stuck between two schools, committed, uncommitted, then recommitted (üò©) and didn‚Äôt end up actually sending in that SIR until like 2 days before it was due... you‚Äôll get a room."
