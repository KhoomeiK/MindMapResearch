UCSD,fmvlbnz,t3_fx2sg8,1586421166.0,"Ece 108, 118, ece141a,  all require ece30"
UCSD,fmruykb,t3_fx30cp,1586336407.0,I think they said they are refunding housing and dining dollars. Seems like they are processing it currently or something
UCSD,fmruus4,t3_fx2sg8,1586336301.0,"I'm also a first year ECE major. I'm taking ECE 35, ECE 17, ECE199, phys 2b, math 20c, Doc 3 rn. Yes it is a lot and I am struggling to keep on top of everything but I am hopeful that I will kick into high gear.

I've taken Ece 5,15,25. 
Ece 35 is a prerequisite for Ece 45 and Ece 65 which are a prerequisite for a lot of upper div ece classes. 
Ece 30 is also a pre req for some upper div classes but not for ece 35, ece 45, ece 65, so it doesn't really matter when you take them.

Ps plz upvote I need 5 karma to post on the main thread I just started being active on reddit"

Dell,ff049i0,t3_eqzyb5,1579465034.0,I have a 7590 with a WD19TB dock and the Dell S2417DG monitor connected through display port to the dock. I can only set the monitor up to 100hz 1440p however I keep it on 85hz because when I change to 100hz the color changes from 8-bit to 6-bit and the color looks horrible. This is due to the physcial ouput port of the laptop being wired through the integrated gpu and uses nivdea optimous. Also g-sync does not work.
