All these zithers, including the western classical one are slightly different in tone and note ranges suited to their style of music. It's cool how they're so similar yet different."
berkeley,fpggd64,t1_fpgetks,1588602159.0,"Sorry if that came off as rude. Really didn't mean for it to be taken that seriously. The school is still paying salaries of those who would have been working in the facilities, at least for those who were working this semester. They're not profiting off it. You're completely free to take a semester off if you think you're not getting your money's worth. I can understand that you're annoyed but I hope this clears some misconceptions."
berkeley,fpgekbw,t1_fpf736t,1588601091.0,"If quality of education is solely based on the physicality of being at university then I think there's something wrong with your idea of education. 

Yes it's harder to learn and teach. It's frustrating that we're paying for things we're not using. But don't you call it a scam. Absolutely no one is benefiting from this."

berkeley,fp1nrlr,t1_fp1ms7k,1588241933.0,"1. On the course listing on classes.berkeley.edu in the description it says 'this course satisfies....' whatever breadth. 

2.Int students can enroll in classes in the community college in Berkeley. You can go to their website and it says how to apply. I haven't applied personally, but looked into it and it seemed pretty straightforward. Just making an account and giving some documents. Make sure to check on assist.org that the course you're taking satisfies whatever breadth tho.

Edit for clarity: also an international student trying to take cc classes over the summer but Corona happened so I'm home now."

And no matter how much I tried to keep following PST, the daylight and darkness just naturally make you feel awake and  sleepy. I've always been consistent with a routine and now all that habit setting hardwork has been thrown out the window."
