UCSantaBarbara,fopucq1,t3_g8ukkz,1587972415.0,Another overworked TA over here while also being international and the sole earner of my household and not allowed to have a job outside of the university. I’m pretty sure once Spring is over I will be homeless because I have no Summer funding from my department or TA opportunity in any department I could teach in.
UCSantaBarbara,fny9avi,t3_g4h334,1587356633.0,"I also had a bad experience with Heather Nichols, she was condescending, and ignored my concerns and questions. She rushed through the examination to determine my prescription, which made me feel insecure in my choices. When I asked about getting glasses done online she was rude, even after I said that was all I could afford at that moment."

The beauty of it is that you can use any type of beans and whatever vegetables you have at hand (I particularly have never roasted veggies or used kale but it sounds delicious and I will try next time I cook it). This recipe asks for specific ingredients but you can improvise a lot! I'm Brazilian and live in the US and this is my ultimate comfort food, and if you make a big batch you can even freeze some and have it later."
