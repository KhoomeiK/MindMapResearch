botany,fpmn3g4,t3_gechkl,1588736767.0,"Edible is a somewhat subjective measure, but generally refers to being able to be consumed safely while being palatable and able to give nutritional value. Even if you can safely consume something, it doesn‚Äôt always give us nutritional value due our digestive systems being unable to process it well. One of the classic examples of this is cellulose, which is a structural polysaccharide found in cell walls that contribute to how rigid and tough a plant is. As cellulose (and other molecules and developmental features) accumulate, the plant gets increasingly tougher, becomes less palatable, and contains less nutritional value due to being unable to be properly processed by our digestive track. My guess is this is what happens with more developed and larger fiddle-heads that lose nutritional value and overall palatability compared to their smaller, more tender counterparts"

The one thing I‚Äôm waiting for is the right courses to roll around. I would at the very least like to attend a quarter where there‚Äôs the general courses (so I can focus on plants) and at best attend when there‚Äôs the plant adaptations course. Though of course a lot of this boils down to circumstance. :)"

botany,fp33rzv,t1_fp1d5et,1588272588.0,"1) Yes, all plants have photosynthetic pigments‚Äîchlorophyll being the primary one (why most plants are green; chlorophyll‚Äôs chemical structure reflects green wavelengths of light). If they didn‚Äôt, they would be unable to split water into oxygen, protons, and electrons and be able to synthesize their own sugars.

2) Yes. Xylem and phloem are found in all angiosperms. Along with flowering being the distinguishing characteristic of angiosperms, they are also vascular.

3) Yup! That waxy layer you feel on the outside of aloe vera is the cuticle.

4) Yes. Roots are characteristic of vascular plants, which we know aloe vera is.

5) No. Angiosperms do not produce spores. Phyla of spore-producing plants include bryophytes (ex: mosses) and filicinophytes (ex: ferns). 

6) Yes. All angiosperms and gymnosperms (non-flowering, non-enclosed seeds) produce pollen as a means of reproduction.

7) Yup! Enclosed seeds are characteristic of angiosperms, and aloe vera produces them. 

Hope this helps!"

SuicideWatch,fow0st4,t3_g9tdho,1588110926.0,"Wow, I really feel this. I used to have a friend that I opened up about various mental health issues, one of which was paranoia about being a shit human and a bad friend always.

SuicideWatch,fovzz1k,t1_fovmvax,1588110508.0,"I think there‚Äôs probably two explanations for this‚Äîeither you haven‚Äôt found the right people to gel with, or your behavior is actually problematic. I know how hard the first one is to deal with when you deviate from what people typically are like. But that‚Äôs okay! 

If your behavior is actually an issue, you can always seek to change. You‚Äôre aware of it, which is half the battle."

plantclinic,fn6moqw,t3_fzx95q,1586702969.0,"Could be spider mites. I would wipe the affected leaves with neem oil and isolate the plant from others if possible.

plantclinic,fn6lpqk,t3_fzxee7,1586702351.0,"You might want to adjust the soil so it retains moisture better.

Additionally, I personally like to water orchids by soaking the pots in water for a few minutes once a week. Water when the pot feels very light and the moisture is completely gone from the soil. Make sure not to over-water, though!"
plantclinic,fn6lena,t3_fzxf07,1586702151.0,"Succulent roots are shallow, and your pot looks rather deep. This can result in the accumulation of water and less stable roots. You might want to consider transferring to a well drained, more shallow pot. Additionally, succulents tend to grow rather tall when there‚Äôs a lack of sunlight. Consider giving it more direct light to keep its proportions more balanced.

You may want to consider trimming the plant (and then use the trimmings to propagate new plants if you want!). I would probably trim it and move it to a more shallow pot while ensuring it gets a good amount of sunlight."
plantclinic,fn6k6ge,t3_fzwayu,1586701332.0,"It could be a few things, though I‚Äôd definitely recommend getting it as much sunlight as you can. Avocados love sun.

It might also be an issue with nutrients/drainage. Make sure the soil is well drained but stays moist‚Äîthis will also help if there‚Äôs salt buildup in the soil. There may also be a deficiency of nitrogen, so consider upping the amount you supply to the soil."
