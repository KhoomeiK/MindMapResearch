UCSantaBarbara,fpf2o8x,t1_fpeds7i,1588560372.0,Don't worry. As long as it's not Halloween IV is just how you remember it
PhysicsStudents,fp73mzd,t1_fp6ibaf,1588363445.0,"While it's definitely not the most elegant solution, couldn't you use conservation of angular momentum to hack an elliptical orbit out? I do agree, it doesn't sound great,  conservation of energy is much prettier here, but always good to see an out if you can't see the right one"
ShouldIbuythisgame,fp309l9,t1_foyw83v,1588270877.0,"Friendly heads up, NieR Automata is still the one I'd pick on that list (maybe barring persona, special place in my heart). Just gotta say it's an ARPG, though, even if it's still produced by Square Enix to help on the story side, it's developed by Platinum. Think Bayonetta combat with a relatively traditional square story."
ffxiv,fp18qu6,t1_fp17z3w,1588227669.0,"As a general rule of thumb, Fending is good for tanks/defense stats, aiming is for (physical) ranged dps, striking/slaying is for melee dps (and usually sam/mnk. drg/nin usually have their own sets)."
TameImpala,fogfcnf,t3_g7cp5h,1587751861.0,I would legitimately buy a print of this is you made a run of it. One of the classiest executions of this on this sub.
LethalLeague,fogc9tv,t1_fofqgs3,1587750730.0,"While your theory might make sense, no one has tried enough and I can't advocate anyone to without being prepared for failure. (And while all the models are technically broken up into parts, the rigs are pure chaos in most software)"
LethalLeague,foe9460,t1_fod4mtz,1587698562.0,"we overwrite the texture files, getting different colors on the outside like that isn't possible without overwriting the shader files.

making real stuff in game like what you've done to date is possible, there's a modding guide to get started in the discord. if you so choose."

Edit: always watch to the end boys and girls"
LethalLeague,fnqnrrc,t3_g3de32,1587168337.0,"Console's inactivity has been a feedback loop, unfortunately. PC still has a relatively active playerbase, but console players will only generally match you through the discord."

Bloom, on the other hand..."
UCSantaBarbara,fn92dm3,t1_fn91zo1,1586757143.0,"To be fair, I've rarely met anyone that did well in integral calc. Without spending more time than most are willing on it, at least."
LethalLeague,fmy3p5f,t3_fxxx9u,1586477448.0,"You gotta build your own servers from the ground up or spend money they don't have to get crossplay. You know TR is like 5 guys, right"
TameImpala,fmt889d,t3_fx6lsj,1586368433.0,"Just be careful with Eventually. I found it in the dusk of a relationship, a week before she broke up with me and couldn't appreciate that song for a year lmao"
UCSantaBarbara,fl4zb1n,t1_fl2ldld,1584824944.0,"Where most departments offered a replacement option of an (at-least optional) online final, chemistry only offered an in-person final that was slated for the finals week, and when things started getting serious, they cancelled the final altogether. Little to no accommodation atop, sure, I get it, it's a university and people should have put in work the whole quarter instead of just the end. But it's just irresponsible to try to bring together hundreds of people in spite of the knowledge there's a pandemic on the loose. And yes, that plan was made with the knowledge it was a pandemic spread here to America."
