rant,fp1qr10,t3_gasdvf,1588244851.0,"I've seen this a lot where people who get sick tend to manipulate their loved one's into acting like servants. It would be ideal to have an honest conversation with her on how she is affecting her family, however, I don't think that people like her (based off of what ur telling me) will listen. I guess what comes off of the top of my head is that you could threaten to stop paying the rent if she doesn't start to treat you right. My I ask why your stepdad isn't helping with rent if he is an independent adult that is living with you?"

UofCalifornia,fozybrq,t3_ga78em,1588199053.0,May I ask why she felt ambitious enough to get ahead in her math classes. Also I give her praise for doing such complex math so early. I couldnâ€™t do calc till junior year

rant,fopsvu3,t1_fopsexa,1587971039.0,"EXACTLY!!! They tell me to be grateful because they see the materialistic things that my parents do (ie a roof over my head), like providing basic essentials to your child isn't your job as a parent. They had absolutely no idea that the past ""relationship"" with my parents was a lot more morbid than they saw."
California,fokscae,t3_g7zddy,1587848013.0,WHY IS THEIS MAN BEING SUED THEN!!! The people that trying to sue Gov Newsom for closing churches are the same people that are likely to be receiving these meals. I am very proud to have a governor like him
UCSD,fojc8q5,t3_g7prls,1587816465.0,"Hello,
The only time you should ever feel like a failure is if you actually fail something. And I know that sounds very vague, but if you think about it, you are actually saving yourself from failure by switching to part time. Would you rather save your mental health by taking a lighter load,allowing you to calm down and focus, or would you rather take a billion units and mess up your mental space, risking a fail in a class and not graduating at all? We are all rooting for you ðŸ˜Œ also, I understand what itâ€™s like to go through depression but I promise you, it will surpass"
rant,foesee3,t1_foes6ey,1587713144.0,"Yea, meanwhile healthcare workers directly exposed to covid patients can only use the orange ones, which offer slightly better protection than a blue surgical. Honestly, we need to know where the government is storing all of the n95s because the people who need it the most (with an exception to patients) are getting very little"
rant,foerxg2,t3_g71wx8,1587712692.0,"Listen, as long as you are not price gauging real 3M masks, you can do what you want. The real issue is that people are taking ACTUAL N95s and selling them for 50 dollars a piece. Every day on my way to work I see people getting arrested because they have hundreds of masks in their trunk."
rant,foeqjh9,t3_g6xumt,1587711388.0,Has anyone thought about the possibility of making masks a mandatory thing?? A lot of private businesses and corporations are doing so. I think if we do this then we can get back out there in large groups

UCSD,fo8zwvw,t1_fo5v5zo,1587607419.0,"I definitely know for a fact that people are gonna try to protest, however, I don't think that it will turn into a Marshall Law type of thing. Most people aren't that stupid to the point where a mass hysteria of defiance will occur. I think that we will come out of this isolation and then go back in."

UCSD,fn7qxfl,t1_fn728mx,1586725828.0,"Hey!! I'm sorry that you had that experience during freshman year. I don't really see race as a huge factor when making friends, it's just that I know that the overall demographics were similar to my current high school so I was wondering if it was similar in regards to culture. I have been to a few white institutions where they are very welcome to all forms of culture"
