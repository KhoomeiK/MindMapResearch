These states will see another surge in cases  (prob not as big as first but significant). They will order another lockdown (prob less aggressive). These states will leak infections into neighboring states. Dumbass Trump will deny everything and blame in on the governors of those states. 

I don't want any of this to happen, but if you look at Nick's post (and other people who believe in stats), it's basically inevitable. Look out for your own family - stay home as much as you can."
