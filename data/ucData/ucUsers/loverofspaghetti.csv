UCSC,fp3an1f,t3_gb0ida,1588275997.0,i think for both classes you have to pick a section bc (at least for me) it was TAs who graded and they grade people in their section but when i took them neither section was mandatory. sorry i don't know anything about transferring but on my portal it just say may 1st and no time so i would just suggest being up early and ready :/ 20a was defiantly the hardest of the bio series for me but i think 1a was the easiest chem looking back! if ur ok at math then u should be fine in 1a and for bio i think it just takes a lot of time bc there's so much info! make sure ur solid on a topic before moving on bc it all builds on each other and if ur confused on something it will def affect other topics :p best of luck w everything and hope u r accepted!! :D
UCSC,fp2fnrr,t3_gaob08,1588260948.0,it had longo for writ2 and he was awesome! we had a short assignment based on a reading for every class and then like 3 or 4 larger assignments but he gave really great feedback and allowed us to redo them for a higher grade. i really liked his class and he’s really passionate (especially about rhetoric) so i’d recommend him! if u have more questions i can try to find his syllabus and get it to u just let me know! :)

UCSC,fn0on96,t3_fym2dy,1586545820.0,"professor bassi for lit61x and dr. dunkin for bio 20b!!! both have been recording their lectures and have worked to make the material really engaging and informative. they’ve also been leaving time for questions and adjusting their pacing based on feedback from the class. loving their classes so much! 

also shoutout to the tas bc they have been helping in lecture, section, office hours, and on discord and it makes asking questions a lot less intimidating!"
UCSC,fmny3v4,t3_fwak28,1586238776.0,i can give u the link to the discord if you’re not already in it bc people have been helping there! we can see if there’s a group who want to make a study session to work through the homework or examples if that would be helpful? also make sure u watch the webcast before lecture and i would suggest attending bc it’s pretty chill and everyone has gotten any questions they have answered! we will get thru this!!!
