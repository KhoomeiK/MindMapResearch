UCSC,fphw19y,t3_gdg2uz,1588628848.0,Hey! I worked at a polling place on campus on March 3 and am planning to do it again in November. PM me if you have any questions.
UCSC,fp59ksc,t1_fp48rz7,1588321124.0,I also got off the waitlist last year on May 31. I think it was the 2nd or 3rd and last wave of freshmen waitlist acceptances.
UCSC,fp559kt,t3_gb6o1x,1588316745.0,If you can put it off until next year I recommend LIT 112C. I got a 100% for very few hours of work.
UCSC,fp3mmdk,t1_fp3aew8,1588281984.0,Gotcha! Good luck.
UCSC,fp382u7,t3_gaob08,1588274723.0,"Unless you have amazing fin aid, it'll likely be cheaper and easier to take writing 2 at a CC."
UCSC,fp37csn,t3_gb0ida,1588274363.0,"Quick tip: see if you can take these classes at Foothill/De Anza Community College. Since UCSC is going online for the summer, you may as well save some money by taking it at a CC, where the classes are often smaller, instructors better, and tuition a LOT cheaper. Foothill, De Anza and Lake Tahoe Community Colleges are the only CCs in CA on the quarter system, so if you take it there it'll transfer in very easily to UCSC and set you up to take the next class in the sequence (if you want/need to do so)."
UCSC,fp36pjq,t3_gb0xel,1588274041.0,"I figure it this way, assuming you're talking about the 5 week sessions:

A ""standard"" course load during a 10 week quarter is 15 units. That's about 9-10 hours per week spent in a classroom, and according to the EOP website, around 35 hours per week spent studying and completing assignments. While this measure is flawed (hard classes might require more time, easier less, if taking a class P/NP it might also be less), imo it's somewhat accurate. That means during a regular quarter, one might spend around 45 hours per week on academics.

&#x200B;

In an accelerated five-week course, the time spent per week increases by a presumed 2x. Again, this measure is flawed: I've had profs explicitly say they've made classes harder or easier for summer session. But it effectively means that taking 10 units/2 classes over a 5 week span is equivalent to taking 20 units/4 classes during a regular quarter.

&#x200B;

Anything is feasible, depending on your time management skills and drive. Personally, I'm planning to max out on credits for summer session, but pay attention to drop deadlines. Since classes are all online, (as you're probably aware) a lot of profs are probably editing syllabi and revising expectations."

UCSC,fozlza2,t3_gafwdm,1588192889.0,Porter or Merrill sound like they could be a good fit.
UCSC,fowjq05,t3_g9zf63,1588121121.0,Sounds to me like they’re not going to open up the housing portal for incoming freshmen until fall is confirmed to be in person.
UCSC,fowj8ol,t1_fowgvop,1588120851.0,I agree.
UCSC,fovd6rk,t1_fotgkwi,1588099346.0,Especially with Sean/Gregg Hunter! He curves exams very generously.
UCSC,fovd3cp,t1_fotg3ii,1588099303.0,"LALS 15 Truth, Justice and Statistics for SR gen ed."
UCSC,fovcofd,t3_g9r3sl,1588099104.0,"Pretty different subject, but in high school I took enough CC classes via dual enrollment that I fulfilled nearly all my gen eds and lower divisions. I started taking upper divs my second quarter and gained junior standing. Now most of friends from hs who go to UCs (and some from private school) are reaching out to me to ask how they can take classes at CCs to transfer to their 4 year institutions bc it’s a ripoff to take (most) lower divs at a 4 year vs a CC. I highly recommend pursuing community college in some capacity, whether before or during UCSC."

Breadit,fn814sv,t3_g05cdj,1586731726.0,"If you live in the US, id recommend a kitchenaid mixer. I just upgraded from a trusty and affordable Hamilton beach stand mixer to a more expensive refurbished kitchenaid stand mixer and the difference is incredible. The kitchenaid can handle about double the amount of  dough the Hamilton beach mixer could and does it with ease, instead of straining and moving around. While it hasn’t been an issue for me yet, I really appreciated that the kitchenaid stand mixers are designed to have a small and easily replaceable part break instead of the whole machine. That being said, the model I bought is nearly 30 lb and isn’t easy to move around. The attachments also don’t reach the bottom of the bowl, so if I make something in a very small batch, I’d be more likely to hand-whisk.

Edit for specificity: in my Hamilton Beach mixer, I could make enough brioche dough for 3 babkas. In my KitchenAid, I can make eight. That being said, the refurbished KitchenAid cost about 3x as much as the new Hamilton Beach."
UCSC,fn7dka2,t3_fzlobn,1586718217.0,I like Ourtree and Reefside for prerolls. Kindpeoples is expensive but they hold promotions on edibles that are marked down enough to be worth it.

UCSC,fmynwfu,t1_fmykk2p,1586490825.0,Unfortunately it’s not heavily promoted so I think a lot of Sociology/other social science majors who might be interested in it aren’t even aware it’s an option. Since it’s such a small major I know many other community studies majors and the alumni community is super nice! I’m glad you know about it now so you can consider it. Feel free to reach out  if you have any questions about the program or UCSC as a whole.
Breadit,fmyexdi,t1_fmye4l5,1586484557.0,You can also mix it yourself.
UCSC,fmyaqgn,t3_fy10rz,1586481836.0,"I’m white but would say that the local YDSA, DSA and IWW chapters are pretty cool. Based off your academic interests, I’d also recommend looking into the Community Studies major. It’s an interdisciplinary social science major with a six-month field study that can potentially take place at an organization anywhere in the world, thus allowing you to leave the performative woke environment of Santa Cruz. It’s also pretty easy to double major with politics, Sociology, Latin American and Latino Studies and legal studies."
UCSC,fmyagps,t3_fy5158,1586481657.0,Tbh you sound a little weird yourself. Idk why the Asian population at UCSC matters in your decision to attend it for undergrad.
UCSC,fmuxtcl,t3_fx0ypu,1586401303.0,"Stevenson does not sound like the college for you. I’d recommend Merrill, Porter, Oakes or Kresge, in that order. I’d recommend 9 or 10, but a lot of the student body (not all though) is international/wealthy or STEM (especially engineering majors), which sounds like it might not be your scene."

UCSC,fmmffe2,t1_fmmenk0,1586204287.0,It’s a letter of continued interest. Applicants usually submit them if they have been deferred for EA or waitlisted. Idk how much impact they have at UCSC compared to smaller private colleges.
UCSC,fmmek1l,t1_fmmed7u,1586203844.0,My bad! I was on the waitlist for freshman admission last year and was unaware that was an option. I just sent an LOCI but ended up getting accepted anyways.
UCSC,fmmdzkq,t3_fw2z84,1586203558.0,"You technically cannot appeal a waitlist decision, only a rejection. I hate to echo the other people replying to this thread, but if your heart is set on UCSC, an aggressive TAG plan from a CC is most likely your best option. Anecdotally speaking, I have a friend from high school who was planning to attend a UC straight out of high school and even submitted an SIR, but his parents unexpectedly decided to stop financially supporting him and he chose to attend a CC and TAG to UCSB. Since he's following a very aggressive course of study, he took classes over the summer right after high school, took classes over intersession, loaded up on extra classes, and did a lot of research to verify which classes he needed/needs to take. As a result, he'll be attending a UC after attending community college for 4 quarters/one year, and be on track to graduate a year early. IMO one of the strengths of the TAG program is that even if you TAG to UCSC, you can still apply to other UCs and CSUs."
UCSC,fmkfv84,t1_fmkeygw,1586153554.0,"Yeah. Especially as a freshman who was living in a res hall on campus, my cost of living in SC is going from $4900 per quarter for a triple and a meal plan I barely used to $800/month for a large double and estimated $250/month for groceries (different units of measurement, I know, but either way my COL is going to go down significantly)."
