I can’t say that’s a bad thing though and the college is really nice as it has been renovated recently. I think Merrill would be a good choice for you too since the people living in Merrill and it’s sister college are known to be “squares” and don’t do drugs (nothing against people who don’t do them that’s just the stereotype). 

Also, look into one of the floors that is substance free I’m pretty sure every college has them."

UCSC,fpj4e09,t3_gdrolc,1588656270.0,"Cowell Stevenson dinning hall, sitting on the tables across the cash register close to the soda fountain because I always drink my pepsi too damn fast. The crusty desert box I’m next to swings open and I swing my head as I hear it only to see the decadent black forest cake UC dining has prepared for us. I’m done with my midterms and have nothing to do besides spend my day on the knoll, “can my day get any better?” I ask myself."
UCSC,fpiu2bg,t3_gdlvxa,1588648726.0,Just need a single major declared by 6th quarter. For double majors you just need to convince both departments that you can fulfill both requirements on time.
UCSC,fpe9jcn,t3_gck4t6,1588543074.0,"You must notify the office of admissions about any and all changes made to your class schedule. If you do not you risk your admission being revoked. 
I would contact them and explain the situation and ask if there are any exceptions that could be made."
UCSC,fpe50oy,t3_gbcnnf,1588540473.0,"Unless they changed it, the housing app asks what the most important factors of housing is to you. They ask if it is your room preference, roommate preference, college preference or community preference (like Rosa parks house).
They use this to prioritize where they place you on campus so if you really want a college put you college as your top priority."
UCSC,fp1g51u,t1_fp1fyca,1588234385.0,"That is true and I agree. Python is much more slicker and modern but I didn’t want op to think of java as some lost cause. Any popular and innovative language, no matter how old, is always relevant and worthy to learn."
UCSC,fp1flis,t1_fp13gqz,1588233864.0,"You definitely would not find java in a legacy codebase as that would imply [it is no longer supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_code?wprov=sfti1). The [last installment of java, Java 14](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/announce/2020-March/000282.html) was released on March 17 2020 and it includes a bunch of modern and sophisticated features which are keeping the language relevant. All I’m trying to say is that java isn’t as obsolete of forgotten as people think, it is a strong competitor to python and is still one of the most popular languages in the world. It’s going to take a long time before developers turn away from java so it’s not at all a bad language to learn. 
That being said java is not my cup of tea and op will benefit from learning any new language."

UCSC,fmtnj7t,t3_fx90yv,1586375788.0,"As of now there is no plan to cancel it or move it online but, as others have said, it will most likely be online. It’s highly unlikely they would cancel summer session as summer session is the only source of money for the uni during summer."
UCSC,fmtmvqd,t1_fmtihpd,1586375462.0,"Holy shit absolutely the fuck not. First rule about mountain lions: don’t approach them. Mountain lions see us as a predator and generally try to avoid us so if you approach them *they will see you as a threat and attack*. It’s also common knowledge *not to feed the wildlife* especially when that wildlife is near extinct.
I know this is a troll but just need to say it Incase anyone thinks this."
