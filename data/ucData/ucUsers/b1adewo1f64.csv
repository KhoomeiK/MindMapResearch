Bloom, Myxomatosis, 15 Step, How to Disappear Completely, and Ful Stop are also classic Colin bass lines for me. Radiohead’s secret weapon really is the rhythm section: Phil and Colin. Calling them strong players is an understatement."
MrFruit,fp3ztb3,t3_gb0qr9,1588288914.0,The content would love it. I’m not so sure their brains would though :/
AnotherEdenGlobal,fo8qbke,t3_g64t6p,1587601662.0,"Part of me wants to tell Galliard’s Japanese voice actor how much of a chad he is. On a serious note, I’m still waiting for Galliard’s supposed 5-star upgrade."

UCSD,fnqg8pq,t3_g39jb7,1587163991.0,"Hearing interesting stories (that I immediately forget) in Geisel while reading, coding, etc. I still miss being at the top floors. Studying is just not the same anymore (I retract what I said in a previous post that I deleted; thinking of posting something at a later date)."
AnotherEdenGlobal,fmz8lmc,t1_fmz814v,1586510693.0,"Easily one of, if not, the best valor chant in the game!"
AnotherEdenGlobal,fmz6voz,t3_fybqmk,1586508751.0,Should I mention that I had the privilege of pulling a 5-star Hismena during one of my first pulls during the initial global launch of IDA part 3? Best episode indeed :D
UCSD,fm9o1sq,t1_fm9nx97,1585872743.0,Indeed
