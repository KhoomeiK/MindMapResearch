soccer,fpag5q9,t1_fpafq4k,1588447481.0,Okay you can have that opinion but my point still stands. Being the best team in the world doesn‚Äôt mean you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù to win the CL. You either win or lose
soccer,fpafn0a,t1_fp93p8l,1588447175.0,Lmfao how does that matter in terms of the CL? Barca was probably the best team in the world in 2015/16 but they lost to Atleti so you can‚Äôt exactly say they deserved to win the CL can you. Same with Man City 17/18

Umtiti was genuinely world class for a few months in the 17/18 season but he had a bad stretch of form, got injured and hasn‚Äôt been the same since. Dembele just can‚Äôt stay fit to save his life.

I have small whiteheads like these on either side of my mouth and tinier ones on my nose. What should I do to reduce and prevent these? 

AM - Cerave foaming cleanser + moisturizer 
PM - Wash with cold water 

My skin is combination but mostly oily. Before getting on Accutane I‚Äôd tried practically every possible gel and cream, but my simplistic routine worked out well with the drug so I just stuck to it."

Had it counted we would‚Äôve won the tie. Barca vs Atleti 2014 when Messi‚Äôs goal was ruled offside and a win would‚Äôve won us La Liga. Refs make shit calls all the time, yet people stick to this weird narrative of only Barca and Madrid being favored by refs.

That being said, the RVP yellow was quite stupid, but I think we would‚Äôve won either way, arsenal had 0 shots on target the entire game"

For me it‚Äôs the people saying Sneijder or Iniesta deserved the Ballon D‚Äôor in 2010. I can‚Äôt believe this opinion gained so much traction that people just say it even though they probably never watched Barca or Sneijder fully that year.
