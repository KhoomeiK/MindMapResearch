trashy,foc1mac,t1_fobi563,1587666096.0,"As fucked up as it is, I consider this normal. If I want to go out to a club (or really anywhere there's alcohol + dancing) I expect to be touched inappropriately. It's an awful casualty but I'm (a) not going to give up dancing at the clubs because of a horny guy or two, and (b) usually shimmying away is enough to get them to stop."
