crazy_omegle_cat_lady,fpez454,t1_fpeyywh,1588558083.0,Specifically rami.nights Instagram live. I’ve been hopping from there back and forth to hear if anyone has heard anything... now it’s all furry porn on the live Instagram
crazy_omegle_cat_lady,fpez1b8,t1_fpeyywh,1588558034.0,She overdosed on some drugs. That’s what I’m hearing from live updates on Instagram.
crazy_omegle_cat_lady,fpey6pv,t3_gd2sh5,1588557500.0,Yeah some people are telling me that’s she’s not in custody but is under investigation who knows... then I heard she’s in the hospital

I hope you guys can see her username for those who want to follow still since she’s doing live with people 
@rani.night

I forgot pickles Instagram username but she’s the woman discussing the update"
SomeOrdinaryGmrs,fpehxtx,t3_gcgqpa,1588547893.0,Any updates about whether she’s caught or not?
Discussion,fp2aghg,t3_gav2q0,1588258288.0,As someone who used to be Muslim and then practiced Catholicism.... I wasn’t fond of it with some of their ideologies. On top of that when I was exposed to science and history that’s when I knew I was legit an atheist. I respect those who have their belief but it’s not for me. For me it’s like telling me to believe in Santa. The only good thing is this religion keeps some people in line with their morals so they don’t act out. Good for them. I just prefer a more scientific perspective.
PublicFreakout,fp29yzf,t1_fp29sy9,1588258029.0,Wait but you heard the guy repeatedly had done it right? The owner told him that he’s damaged at least twice
PublicFreakout,fp10du2,t3_gajz8k,1588221138.0,Wait she couldn’t get out if it? Was it by choice?
PublicFreakout,fp106d1,t1_fp0yql9,1588220991.0,Jeez that’s so sad... did he manage to keep his business going despite the losses?

TrueOffMyChest,fp0e7kg,t3_gab5xx,1588207553.0,I feel you... my ass is going back to work only for an extra $3 pay... tf is this bs. I’m sorry and I feel you. What’s worse is the scandals going on in these hospitals that are treating the patients too... I guess better in this shitty situation compared to that

So far I’m crossing my fingers it works otherwise... I have to find another drug to research on :(.  By means of progress I’m hoping they’ll post it soon since they started their clinical trial on April 3. 
What I mean by “they” I mean the pharmaceutical company Inovio. Who are funded by Bill Gates and all these other people interested and has the 💰"
Discussion,fos0h9k,t1_fos03v9,1588021733.0,"Yeah I mean the whole market was filthy to begin with. The Chinese government should’ve at least had something enforced about the cleanliness of these markets. However, Covid-19 pretty much shares similar sequences to SARS so it would be right to assume the origins are in a bat. Also, ferrets and cats are prone to catching it compared to other domestic animals as well as dogs. Must be due to some enzyme receptor that cats and ferrets share compared to dogs and other domestic animals. So anyone with a car and ferret... keep them quarantined too!"
TrueOffMyChest,fos03id,t3_g97woe,1588021538.0,As a student I feel you. Only issues is these online classes are a pain in the ass. But I have to go back to work soon so that’s a little downfall but at least I get paid
TrueOffMyChest,forzkq2,t3_g92fbj,1588021276.0,That’s good to hear that Reddit gives a more unbiased opinion than these mods
Discussion,forz9xa,t3_g95h1v,1588021124.0,Yeah I was reading a research article that the bats are the potential reservoir for the virus but the actual vector animal is unknown. It would be interesting to find out what animal did transfer it to us. Must be a mammal so your guess is as good as mine and those scientists
PublicFreakout,fojp5gq,t1_foj0wpg,1587826373.0,I know we already spoke about that... that’s just taking everything back to the ice age. Better yet everyone is from Africa when it comes to original human origins.

Canada has free health care too lol"
TrueOffMyChest,fohfvnw,t3_g76bcu,1587765263.0,Well I don’t think all of them are “self-proclaimed” victims. I’m a woman but I know when I’m being a terrible person to someone or that person is being a terrible person to me... I guess it’s more entitled if you come across “those” women. In all honesty we are all humans and we can legit be victims from someone else’s hands
TrueOffMyChest,fohfffu,t3_g70p1l,1587765024.0,Ooh my bf does it too!!! I don’t find it it’s weird at all honestly. I find it normal

TrueOffMyChest,fogxsfo,t1_fof5kyy,1587758200.0,I just saw an Aussie girl spit on a random Asian girl in Australia. And I’ve heard about some injustice of shooting down Muslims in Australia. It doesn’t sound as nice but I’ve traveled there before and it’s extremely beautiful as well as most of the people I’ve encountered were kind to me

TrueOffMyChest,fogx70z,t1_fofj38t,1587757995.0,Okay dumb question but can you really buy like legal goods on there? I’m just asking in case I wanted to purchase makeup or an outfit
Discussion,fofz8d5,t3_g72amn,1587745397.0,Yah also there’s this on couple on Instagram ... I forgot the name but if anyone knows who I’m talking about please verify it if you want. I just see that these two are always yelling at each other specifically the female while her man is acting like he’s talking to other girls. It’s funny for awhile but if it’s a reoccurring theme I just... idk
rant,fofyz16,t1_fofgib6,1587745270.0,"Jeez that’s definitely something for sure. But yeah for the most part i agree with you that it is ego. As for desperation... damn at least go for someone single. 

As for women who do that as well, I just don’t know what to say to them in all honesty and usually if they try I just trust my bf on handling them. Specifically one girl that tried to get him to go out and drink. I just found it cute that my bf gets admirers here and there, but I also feel secure when he responds to them with a firm “no” and that he’s happily taken."
PublicFreakout,fofyi86,t1_fofydv3,1587745038.0,Oh yeah if people in general are going around harassing others I don’t condone that but we should also see that they shouldn’t be an example of the entire population. It’s wrong.
PublicFreakout,foeoeju,t1_foeikyo,1587709459.0,OMG THANK YOU this is exactly what I wanted haha it makes sense now with all those loading to figure out why he’s stuck on some word 🙏🏼
rant,foeiuom,t1_foeipv6,1587704916.0,Okay because if you haven’t tried it I wouldn’t suggest right away to think that way.
rant,foeiguw,t1_foei7wu,1587704627.0,If you really think she’s like that... have you ever told her your issues? Does she listen to your troubles with the same care and listening that you do?
rant,foehrew,t1_foegsq4,1587704100.0,Ignore him/her. Honestly I’m sorry what you’re going through and I can admit I am like that with my bf when it comes to frustration with school and work. But I always feel bad about it when I get frustrated at him and I end up apologizing or balling like a huge ass baby. But if anything she should consider that you are trying with her but if you want maybe reassure her but tell her how you feel. That you do care about her but no matter what you do she makes you feel like it’s not enough. If that can get to her then hopefully she’ll realize something. But I wish this didn’t cause you anxiety. I’m sorry to hear that I really hope you two can work it out and if it doesn’t I also hope that you both find someone right
rant,foehc25,t3_g7213w,1587703786.0,Yeah I’ve had some guys disrespect my bf like that... honestly I’ve been ignoring at least the ones in my DMs but one guy that I met at this random party tried to get at me and at first I told him I had a bf but he didn’t believe me since I only went with my sister to that party. He kept trying to get me to dance with him but I just got annoyed and he killed the mood for me to enjoy this party so I left. It sucks because idk if it’s an ego thing or something else
DoesAnybodyElse,foeg5o7,t1_foeehyv,1587702953.0,That sounds terrible! My TMJ had affected me once at work but luckily I didn’t have to do much interaction with people. However now I have to avoid certain foods and also not bother talking anymore. I’ve considered some exercises and even started meditating and doing yoga. Stretching my body has helped but ughhh there are these random times at night where maybe I just roll on my side and that’s why my jaw starts to react... but it just makes really frustrated. I hope it doesn’t get worse
PublicFreakout,foe50tx,t1_foe4pe6,1587696156.0,"We all are because we all come from this planet. The fact that people are forcing others to leave as well as building walls to separate people is the reason for this. That’s where this group in the video see it’s a “right” for them to protest, telling others to go back to Europe. By recent historical time, they would be in fact indigenous."
PublicFreakout,foe0s03,t1_foe0ka7,1587693792.0,Lmao same! Plus I heard maybe corona? And asking for some help for his country. Overall it just seems like a rant.
PublicFreakout,fodw1wo,t3_g6pblf,1587691208.0,Okay if someone could translate this for me please?! Because this is hilarious
PublicFreakout,fodvzb9,t1_fobikw0,1587691168.0,I know you didn’t just use that... farsi and Arabic don’t sound the same. We use some words between each language but we don’t sound the same. Dialects and accents vary everywhere in Arab countries and that in Iran
PublicFreakout,fodvu9o,t1_fodvrri,1587691091.0,Okay then be off with your day
PublicFreakout,fodvota,t3_g6x7t7,1587691010.0,I couldn’t quite clearly hear what he said about accusing girls. And why did this happen?
PublicFreakout,fodv23p,t1_fod9npx,1587690667.0,I’m just responding because I want to know what’s happening too
PublicFreakout,fodtyqz,t1_fodtj7b,1587690077.0,So please have some respect and stop instigating someone. When I said stop it please do
PublicFreakout,fodttat,t1_fodsk26,1587689997.0,It does explain it but you had to mock me about my age and how my story has holes. I’m just telling you a general fact of what happened to my friend. Idk when and why she got deported other than someone reporting about her speaking in a foreign language. ICE came and deported her from there idk why she didn’t bother to fight and the fact her parents left from what she told me her parents had planned after retiring to move back to Iran. (Since they were the first generation immigrants who were originally born in Iran) I barely talk to her now but she told me she is much happier in Iran and is engaged now. I even asked she could go public to voice her own injustice but she told me that since her family is with her she doesn’t mind. The rest of the Iranians who are close to her and know are upset but they won’t do something to upset her family if they’re not content in their new life. If this isn’t enough for you then don’t bother pestering me anymore because something clearly is concerning here. But what concerns me is that you’re okay with ICE and their actions.
PublicFreakout,fodsdvq,t1_fodsbhi,1587689240.0,Which I did.
PublicFreakout,fodrn67,t1_fodrl5o,1587688840.0,Nope can’t do but do with what will help ease your mind
PublicFreakout,fodrjkl,t1_fodrgn8,1587688784.0,Take care :)
PublicFreakout,fodrao9,t1_fodr63z,1587688648.0,Okay believe what you want. Bye :)
PublicFreakout,fodqxnx,t1_fodqtjp,1587688448.0,That’s because her family ended up moving with her. They’re not leaving their daughter alone in Iran. Like I said I don’t want to further go into it. Thanks
PublicFreakout,fodqhrm,t1_fodcqy9,1587688206.0,Thank you that’s a first time for me to be told that! I just any future leaders will have that empathy towards each other that’s all
PublicFreakout,fodq04t,t1_fodpx64,1587687936.0,Sorry I can’t do that have a nice day
PublicFreakout,fodpxg0,t1_fodplr8,1587687894.0,I’m not mad at you I’m just concerned that you are okay with ICE. Like I said I don’t want to continue this and I didn’t make this up. It has happened to people who even got their citizenship here as well as to those who are native here. I’m not mad just concerned and over this
PublicFreakout,fodpevk,t1_fodp9mp,1587687614.0,Right so I’m going to make this up? Okay I don’t want to continue any further it just tells me that you’re okay with what ICE is doing
PublicFreakout,fodopi4,t1_fodojc4,1587687288.0,She didn’t do anything wrong other than be an Iranian. She was even born here yet got deported.
TrueOffMyChest,fodo1yn,t3_g6wczs,1587687059.0,"I remember I couldn’t stop crying when I accidentally stepped on my puppies paw. Even tho she was over it within five to ten minutes I felt so guilty, but when she would do it I definitely thought it was endearing because she immediately hops off thinking she hurt me."
PublicFreakout,fodnkm6,t1_fodnblw,1587686898.0,So you’re going to ignore the families that get deported and sent back to other countries is not tearing apart families? Which is what ICE is exactly doing. My own friend can’t return from Iran because of the same bs they did to her and you think it doesn’t tear apart people?
PublicFreakout,fodmlb0,t1_fodmc0c,1587686554.0,That’s true but it’s only fair that they respond this way now. It’s not hurting anyone compared to how the American government is allowing to tear families apart.
PublicFreakout,fodlbaq,t1_fodl274,1587686109.0,Not if the people who are suppressing them and telling them to get out is playing that exact game. Regardless they were there before the rest of us and had a longer amount of claim to those lands before the settlers and conquistadors came and trying to claim everything in the name of their country.
PublicFreakout,fodkygd,t1_fodkstn,1587685976.0,We aren’t going back to the ice age. Because that’s just like you saying that no one belongs here at all. It doesn’t matter
PublicFreakout,fodkg3w,t1_fodk6w4,1587685800.0,I’m referring to their Mayan/Aztec ancestors. They were pretty much indigenous to all parts of the west as well as any other Native tribes that existed.
PublicFreakout,fodjibc,t1_fod214g,1587685468.0,Yeah it’s the Land bridge you’re right!
PublicFreakout,fodj9pb,t1_fode2ez,1587685385.0,Yeah but their other ancestors are indigenous so they pretty much still belong here
PublicFreakout,fodiv81,t1_fodbey6,1587685243.0,They were here before the Spaniards came. They are the indigenous people of the west with other natives here
PublicFreakout,fodidqs,t3_g6rouc,1587685065.0,Well he isn’t wrong
PublicFreakout,fobnxh6,t3_g6ofuj,1587661772.0,I had broken my right radius before and the realization was scary. I couldn’t figure out whether I should panic or worry about the pain. I was just shocked.

PublicFreakout,fobmn31,t1_fobdmuc,1587661380.0,I agree. I’m not completely familiar with her either and yes I think what she is doing it outrageous from now what I’m looking at. But I think if there was a more civil or even mature stand and conversation with her at least we could get our points across. It’s not every day we get to see such civil interactions occur tho.
PublicFreakout,fobbevv,t1_fob7are,1587658103.0,Ahaha this sent me
PublicFreakout,fobaz66,t3_g6lgpj,1587657964.0,This is disgusting. My dad is a motorist and he tells me stories like this too. That people would try and race him or chase him down like wth why?!
