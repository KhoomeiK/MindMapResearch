worldnews,fp4jb9u,t1_fp4baqo,1588300297.0,"Just a reminder that the USA spends [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_government_budget_per_capita) to other OECD Countries, it just does a poor job of it. [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-spending.htm) if you switch the chart to Thousand US dollars/capita."

Hence, why a lot of them are still isolated in Academia rather than dealing with the real world. Stuff like this  is why I don't miss being a student whatsoever."
cscareerquestions,fouvyry,t3_g9q14u,1588091303.0,"You'll be fine. Realistically, they are looking for a few things. One is to make sure you don't have serious problems with the law e.g. Felonies or a pattern of Misdemeanors etc etc. Two  is to make sure that you can't be easily blackmailed / convinced to give over State secrets. This means things like do you have large gambling debt or  if you have done drugs in the past are you honest in telling the government that you did them so you can't be exploited. As far as the issues you mentioned, you'll be perfectly fine."
UCSantaBarbara,fnny8sh,t3_g2ui9b,1587105525.0,"UCSB has historically had a much smaller Engineering department than the other UCs you listed. For undergrad there would be no meaningful difference between the programs at the schools you listed, but I have no idea for graduate school.  What is your reason for getting a masters? Is it to make VISA application easier? If that's the issue then it shouldn't matter. Any of the UC's you listed will be good enough to get you into a Big N company with enough leetcode and general interviewing ability."

I'm 5'11 230 , a combination of lifting/bodyfat,  and that's what I wear. I don't know if it would be wide enough for you though as it has a waist at 38.5  . It does feel slightly short for me and would be perfectly fine for someone 5'9."

It's the right size for me in terms of wave catching ability, although I sometimes debate if a 5-7 wouldn't be better in terms of ride-ability and being able to throw it around. The board is really good at catching waves. For reference I usually surf a 45 liter 6'6 dominator. You need to get something way smaller. If you go too big, you'll be able to catch waves, but you won't have fun on small waves which is the whole point of the board."
