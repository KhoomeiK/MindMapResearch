UCSantaBarbara,fphq8s9,t3_gdj40p,1588625816.0,Is this all being done by hand? I feel like you could give some surroundings (while still staying spatially accurate) using world edit and save a lot of time.
UCSantaBarbara,forngmp,t3_g979up,1588015206.0,"Depends on a lot of things. Rigorous to pass? No. Rigorous to get a 4.0? Probably.

Also it depends on where you are from. I came from a more rural town that did not put as much pressure on education, and to me UCSB is much harder to get straight A’s. However some of my friends come from top schools in the Bay Area and UCSB is a breeze."

EscapefromTarkov,fohe3ao,t1_fohdpcz,1587764407.0,"Do you ever feel like you are stealing real life money from people?

Like if you kill a person with a kit worth a million rubles and then sell that million online, is that not similar to just taking something from someone in real life and then selling it? 

I’m genuinely curious not just hating on you."

LosAngelesRams,focikmm,t1_fochd51,1587671745.0,"The game is the most simple of all games. If you think of the game, you lose the game. If you are not thinking of the game, then you are winning the game. This means that the only time you are winning the game is when you do not know you are winning the game (and if you do know you’re winning the game, you’ve lost the game).

UCSantaBarbara,fnxgzzr,t3_g4hfl4,1587338440.0,"At UCSB we have quarters, not semesters. For example from the beginning of January to end of March is one quarter (winter), and start of April until middle of June is another quarter (spring). 

Spring quarter is when there is the most going on. We have Extravaganza, it’s like UCSB’s own music festival. In general, I’d say people are a lot happier during spring quarter, but maybe it’s just me."

LosAngelesRams,fnq3gln,t3_g3a7vr,1587156956.0,"Can someone read the article for me (locked behind paywall)?

The problem isn’t with the Rams being the 3rd most popular of all LA teams, that is to be expected. The problem is that the Rams are not the most popular NFL team of all NFL teams.

What I mean is if the survey said “Rank these LA teams from first to last,” there could be football teams outside LA that are more popular. Did they include the 9ers in the survey? Raiders?"

On an unrelated note, does anyone know how hearings with the Academic Senate will work on Zoom?"

nfl,fn3zher,t1_fn3sq2v,1586630985.0,"Not sure why you are getting downvoted. NFC West is so volatile year in and year out that, while I don’t expect it, it’s entirely possible for rams to not win a game within the division. 

Seems like so long ago that Cardinals were decent, but it really wasn’t that long ago that they went 13-3."
LosAngelesRams,fn24jb9,t1_fn1w6e3,1586577650.0,"Wait, are you saying it’s a bad thing to go all in with a rookie as a QB? Idk about you guys, but I’ll take a few years of mediocrity (if you even want to call it that) for a SB. I’d imagine most fan bases in the NFL would take that trade as well.

Hindsight is always 20/20, but every deal the rams inked made sense at the time, and it resulted in best string of 3 seasons we’ve had in a very long time, and a SB that we should have won."

At some point, all these guys did their job well enough to be a starter on a Super Bowl caliber team. Only thing Fisher couldn’t development was Oline, WRs, and QBs, which is what makes up most production in the league today."

UCSantaBarbara,fmyxegq,t1_fmyxb8k,1586498775.0,Thanks! Didn’t know they had already addressed this. At least they told us beforehand instead of waiting for people to ask.
UCSantaBarbara,fmyx4cj,t1_fmyx01b,1586498510.0,"Yeah, but the difference this time is that we might not have to pay the fee *before* learning we won’t be on campus. Maybe it’s a false hope, but it’s hope nonetheless."
UCSantaBarbara,fmywvjw,t1_fmyvy85,1586498281.0,Do you think that they might change that fee if classes get moved online? I believe that fee is mainly for resources that are only available if you are on campus.
