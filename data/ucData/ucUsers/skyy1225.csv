UCI,fo77apo,t3_g64976,1587573482.0,"I cant study at home. Everything is too distracting and noisy, and i never have this lack of self motivation ever. Im falling behind on all my classes and I have a hard time catching up, since the profs like to assign a bunch of work due in a short manner of time. Im exhausted and burned out. I just want a break. I miss all my friends, and being able to go out. Stay tf home people. Its not that hard."
