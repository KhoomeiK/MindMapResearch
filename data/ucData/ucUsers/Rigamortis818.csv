I've been trying to tell people on Reddit that the virus simply isn't that prominent here in Los Angeles; we've been on lockdown for 6 weeks and the virus hasn't affected many people here. That's why less and less people here have been wearing masks unless they have to to enter a facility, and more and more people are beginning to break the guidelines set forth.

I'm not necessarily saying this is logically sound, but at the same time I can't blame people for wanting to do certain things to return to normal considering things feel rather normal here. You wouldn't really know there's a pandemic going on here in Los Angeles...

Not everyone can do school online; some have limited computer time, WiFi, and necessary resources to succeed. Some live in small homes with no privacy or space to work productively in. Some live in abusive households.

School going online has already hugely dampened the education of many; not to mention it includes a demographic of people that are the least susceptible. It should be opened in the Fall.

I do agree that elementary school is a tough one, but so is the alternative of having parents deal with their young children needing homeschooling at the same time as working from home is next to impossible. If workplaces are opened up, its impossible for schools not to follow, as they are essentially day care services.
