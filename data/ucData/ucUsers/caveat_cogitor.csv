TrueFilm,fp3px55,t3_gb41bv,1588283667.0,"Hmm hard to find one because there's so many reasons for a film to appeal.

&#x200B;

A few I can always watch:

**The Princess Bride** \- sort of an 80's masterpiece. Nothing too heavy, potently quotable, influential, and most importantly accessible humor that stands up over time

**Edward Scissorhands** \- some similar qualities as The Princess Bride, but with a great gothic aesthetic clashing with atomic-era pastels. Great, sometimes dark humor, and I find it comforting as someone who often feels misunderstood and doesn't really feel like they belong. The melancholic tensions and bittersweet mood keep the overall mood of the film somewhat ambiguous, which I find to be stimulating.

**House of 1000 Corpses** \- just a great, fun slasher film. I love the psychedelic/comic-book aesthetic, the characters are great. Can kinda be watched casually or if you want to pay attention there's always something new.

**Synecdoche New York** \- this is a filmmaker's film (about a playwright making a play about their life and the play they are writing...) and one to discuss with your film buff friends. Definitely not a casual watch, it is long, dense, and for particular reasons it can be difficult to follow. Great absurdist and dark humor, some great quotes, and there's always some new detail or connection to notice when you re-watch it.

I think some things that tie together most of the films I really love are character driven plots (and well delivered!) and great cinematography. I could list so many more, but these are the ones that come to mind immediately, and like I mentioned are ones I am nearly always in a mood to watch.

If the loop really is useful due to some sort of asyncronicity or something, it's possible that the loop may succeed at creating the folder, but the permissions failed to set.

But electric guitar as a whole has become less prominent in music. It's more frequently used as background in non-rock genres. Guitar solos are mostly non-existant in current pop/Top 40/radio tunes. The songs and their topics overall have been played out on the radio ad nauseum over the years, and pop-party songs aren't really on my list of never-get-old tunes. And as a guitarist, while EVH's technical chops are impressive, they aren't particularly interesting from a long-term perspective. As a similar but way worse example -- DragonForce is a band I never liked -- they just play really fast and technical and that's fucking boring. If I want self-indulgent guitar soloing (and sometimes I do) then I can listen to Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn all day long and never want for EVH."

Your example of The Jealous Crow is certainly bluegrass-*ish*, but I think really it's a folk song and a lot of the examples others are giving are not bluegrass at all (1952 Vincent Black Lightening as an example) -- there's nothing wrong with that, but just want you to be aware that you might be looking for something broader than 'bluegrass', since that might help in your search. The core of bluegrass is usually a straightforward arrangement -- guitar, mandolin, fiddle, banjo, with vocal harmony -- and usually includes instrumental 'solo' sections for each instrument, and the structure usually follows certain forms. There is some flexibility, but for another example The Fox as played by Nickel Creek is really a narrative-driven *folk* song you might like, but it isn't strictly bluegrass... some of their other songs are however."

Was gonna say this. Also consult your teacher to see if they have a strong preference. But I think crossing your legs causes you to have to hunch over, which is probably leading to all sorts of other problems long term as your body tries to compensate.

I think the most common ergonomic problem I see with newer guitarists is their left wrist being severely bent and their left elbow causing this due to its positioning... you do seem to have this under control, so keep that up! If you look at any great guitarist (or other musician) you will see they are extremely relaxed (Zakir Hussain I find to be a hilariously extreme example... I swear he just floats away on clouds every time he plays Tabla) so pay attention and listen to your body. Also stretches and strength training can help, if you have access to a personal trainer they might be able to help in this area too.

In this case, additional context made it super interesting and you did a great job of explaining that. Then you provided a wide range of examples, which really gave a sense of depth and breadth... the way you presented this reminds me of when someone talks about a teacher that was really engaging because they were so personally excited about the subject matter.

I get the whole 'enjoy it however you like' but at least try and see why people think there's a right way.

On Windows 10, you can hit \[Windows Button\] + A to bring up a menu to see if you are in airplane mode, if wifi radio is on, etc, and you can toggle things there. It may help if you've inadvertently turned something off. If it's a laptop there could also be a hardware button to turn off the wifi radio and it may need to be turned back on."

I crush all the noodles up into crumbles and then add a bit less water than the recipe, and cook it for like 15 minutes until it is a thick porridge. I try to add some veggies either midway (small pieces of broccoli or other hearty veggies) or at the end (green onions) and top it off with sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds, and a tiny bit of rice vinegar (a little goes a long way, but it adds depth). I don't try to emulate proper ramen if I'm making instant."

tvtropes,fmuy4ko,t3_fwm524,1586401508.0,"Most sitcoms don't have high budgets or particularly skilled writers, which is kinda the point. If they were better they'd be writing for another show. Modern sitcoms are born from atomic-family-era TV like I Love Lucy (which was brilliant at times in its own right, but it was original at the time) but most of the content is recycled from then, or at best topical to current situations. Most are meant to be just entertaining enough for you to stay and watch the commercials so they can bring in revenue. In this way they are very similar to soap operas, only for a prime-time audience instead of stay-at-home moms. I feel they basically just want to distract/numb you enough so you feel comfortable spending your life consuming and reproducing without getting any fancier ideas about what life can be.

IMO sitcoms are basically the TV equivalent of Top 40 radio, which is compromised largely by what I call 'baby making music' AKA superficial love songs. I can't tell how many times I've been at a dentist/doctor or in a Uber ride and they play that awful radio drivel... bouncing back between annoying commercials and songs that are 70% about human reproduction. There's other topics man.

There are and have been alternatives. You could argue that The Simpsons is at it's heart a sitcom that grew beyond the medium and created the whole 'modern adult cartoon' genre, paving the path for South Park/Family Guy/etc.

Other shows include Arrested Development, which is definitely specifically about a family... and yet it explores a huge range of topics while actually being funny, unlike The Big Bang Theory.

Sorry for the rant lolol"
