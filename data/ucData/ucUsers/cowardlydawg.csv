QueerWomenOfColor,fpjk4mm,t3_gdsgil,1588671524.0,"thank you so much for writing this. it was a very important read for me. i never hear stories about it being liberating to stay IN the closet, but it’s the same sort of the mindset i have been adopting as well as of recently. we have very similar stories in terms of the conflict of culture and friends not understanding and the pain it would truly cause to come out. my mom said she wanted to die at the thought of me being gay too. it’s a jarring experience, right? still in the part where it makes me want to die too but the fact that you and your mom can still have a pretty good relationship and love each other and that you can stay connected to your culture through her is really hopeful to me. i’m so sorry for your loss, and i truly hope you’re doing well :) <3"

progressive_islam,fpihvmp,t3_gdjl6r,1588641234.0,"i know exactly how you feel and i’m pretty much exactly the same! i have a friend from armenia who’s talked about how just as a culture they’re christian and how she’s never felt very religious but still identifies with it culturally, and i feel pretty much exactly the same about islam. identifying with a religion in a cultural sense is very real and not uncommon. i think the way we feel about islam would be more common to come across in muslim majority countries, like how you find so many people who could be called “culturally christian” in western countries, who celebrate christmas and such. but like you said it’s harder to find people like us in western countries. i guess you’d have to search more specifically for people who were “raised muslim” than broadly muslims. there are lots of people in bigger cities that have been “raised muslim” and still acknowledge the connection to their culture but aren’t really practicing. i promise you that we’re all over the place dude. i just started a new job and someone i never would’ve guessed was muslim asked me if i was fasting for ramadan bc i kept on declining offers for food and they said that they were trying to as well but aren’t very religious. i’m sure the both of us will find our people dude, inshallah"

QueerWomenOfColor,fp8xbru,t1_fp8rx0k,1588406284.0,"salam!!!!!!! :)))) i didnt know that the bisexual has MENA rep!! i know one the main actresses directed the miseducation of cameron post, a movie i loveee, dunno how i never figured that her name was arab. maybe i’ll check it out now! i’ve also seen like an episode of The Bold Type, the show wasn’t really my vibe but there’s literally a WOC couple of a black woman and an iranian hijabi lesbian woman which is pretty unique and cool. 

having worn a hijab for about a decade of my life and only taken it off in the last month or so and having some noticeable arab features as well, i know what you mean about being clocked and stared at like you’re a threat to society. it’s hell. was called a terrorist for most of adolescence, by complete strangers, by friends and even teachers (as a joke, but still a bit uncomfortable). 

besides that, most of the arabs i spent my time around at the mosque/family friends were egyptians!! love my egyptian khaltis, love when we’d go to the park and order some bizza and drink bebsi and they would call you GAmil. you guys hold a space place in my heart, i love your dialect, and i’d love to spend time in egypt. 

i agree that there isn’t much of a universal culture, but i also feel that we’re all sort of just slight variations of each other and have a lotttttt in common. i’m hoping to explore more about arab culture outside of religion. of course i can distinguish the culture from the religion but the very few arabs i know are muslim, and it’s hard to find spaces to bond with other people just on the basis of being arab. hoping to visit casablanca after corona and find my place/connect with it all a little bit more. i wholeheartedly agree that there’s more to our culture than religion. i can see it, i loved it and identified with it in the very short amount of time i spent back in the motherland as a kid my dude. 

in terms of religion, i’d say i’m definitely closer to you in belief than any muslims i know personally. wouldn’t say that i don’t identify as muslim anymore, and i appreciate religion, i’ve been fasting this ramadan, but as a lesbian growing up i don’t feel that i belong in muslim spaces and i never have, doubt i ever will, dont even think i want to. i also wouldn’t necessarily call myself “religious” and that’s the biggest reason why i took off the hijab recently; it almost felt disrespectful that i was presenting myself this way and even identifying this way when i hadn’t been praying in years and barely agreed with so much of the scripture/ideals. i value the base stuff and i think i always will, but i’ve been hurt too much and spent too much time in fear to ever really be able to reconcile with traditional organized religion, i think. i enjoy the religious things i grew up with on my own for the most part, and have never had very close muslim friends outside of childhood out of fear that they’ll find out who i really am and tell my mom and i’ll get disowned or something. i spent most of my adolescence alone, terrified, and convinced i was the only queer person of color ever. it’s nice finding other queer people, but most of the time queer spaces are overwhelmingly white, and it’s been exhausting being literally the only brown/black person in the room for most of my life. not to mention the hijab until recently. i went to a small pride event in a hijab once, it wasn’t a comfortable experience for me or anyone else there. they felt threatened, and i felt bad. i’m sort of in an in between, where i’m striving to be more free but also still feel the need to be reserved and modest. not to mention i still live with my parents. i’m scared that i’ll never feel “normal” or really fit in because i’m so behind compared to my peers :(. hoping to figure it all out one day 

and i can only imagine how much worse everything would’ve been if i’d grown up back in morocco/MENA. i joke about visiting and being thrown in jail somehow, but sadly that’s a real threat for hundreds of thousands of our people back home. so yeah just gonna focus on finding my other arab-americans for now lmao. 

(sorry for all the rambling, i got really excited that someone who could relate responded. i guess i’m asking for advice/searching for a little bit of hope?) 

on a more positive note, i’m glad you’ve been expanding your knowledge on our culture and i’m happy for you! i hope to get there too!! i agree that it’s incredibly rich and i love to learn about our history and the diversity of language and thought and how passionate we are as a people. inshallah the world will see that side of us more in the future."
QueerWomenOfColor,fp840ck,t3_gbkp4u,1588382820.0,"i’m half black, half moroccan. my dad is from LA too and converted to islam when he was 14, later joining the nation of islam. my mom grew up in casablanca and wanted the american dream, she found my dad online, they got married for her to help him raise his kids from past marriages, and for him to help her reach financial stability. when my dad was at work my mom spoke to me in arabic at home, i still understand a decent amount and can form the simplest sentences. my dad always played motown, we watched roots while we were young, and my older (half) brothers showed us lots of classic 90s black content. i’d say most of the people i knew until i was seven were black. then we moved upstate. we’re pretty white washed now, my biggest connection to blackness is music and dealing with racism; my biggest connection to arab-ness is religion (? sorta) and dealing with racism. not much culture to me, kinda sad how much suburbia wipes away your roots :(. you can learn more about black culture through film and music and READING. there are lots of great black authors. dunno much about arab culture outside of religion. the food is delicious. you could also probably find some good books. ramy is a good show to watch about the arab-american experience."

BLACK is BEAUTIFUL. we’re strong, our hair is a force to be reckoned with, and our skin is beautiful. also, we don’t get sunburned lmao!! we have a rich culture and i hope that as you grow older you can surround yourself with more positive black spaces and recognize the beauty in all of us. it’s easier said than done, but it can and will happen. 

i didnt go through anything as bad, but it still sucks. my dads black and my moms arab/north african. i think she’s grown to really dislike blackness because it isn’t what she thought it would be when she decided to marry my dad after knowing him for seven days and coming to the US, she just saw him as a cheap way to get The American Dream. she doesn’t like our hair, hates when we say n*gga to each other, and prefers when our skin is lighter. she insists on us not marrying black, she wants arab grandchildren, she wants them to “look like her.” she says pretty often that if she’d known what it’s like to be black in america, she wouldn’t have married a black man. she regrets it a lot and it’s more than obvious. i think she has good intentions and she’s saying that she would’ve wanted an easier life for her children, but it also just kinda feels like there’s a lot of resentment towards blackness. she insists that we’re ARAB, and i agree but also correct her and say that we’re BLACK as well, which she likes to ignore. i understand why she’s bitter because my father is pretty absent and hasn’t helped raise us at all, so all she knows is that the stereotype of inactive, lazy black fathers is true. she’s been done dirty and has typical biases. it’s just sad because i identify much more with my blackness than my arabness :(. i understand a decent amount of specifically moroccan arabic and barely speak it, and outside of my childhood, i haven’t spent much time around other arabs (my arab family is half way across the world, we have black family members right down the street). that side of my race seems to be solely secured by shared religious beliefs (we’re muslim) but i’m not even very religious so i feel less connected to it and i think it’s obvious to my mom. tbh, my mom WOULD have had an easier time if she’d just married arab. too bad we’re black. :("

AskReddit,fnrzrkw,t1_fnrtqeb,1587207836.0,"of course i am not trying to excuse the rich or the powerful or the psychopathic narcissistic selfish people who take advantage of/create the systems that have failed us— actually, destroyed us. they often have little hands on involvement in the real world cruelties of war. they are often just removed from it enough to live lavishly with an unscathed conscience. however, the same most definitely cannot be said for who they send to do their deeds. 

there is a lot more nuance behind what it means to fight in a war/be a part of violence. often those most vulnerable are young and desperate. they need community, they need stability, and they are VERY easily brainwashed. no one really has the “moral high ground” when you just need to SURVIVE, when you’re starving and have been surrounded with war/violence your entire life and have to no real way to cope with the deeply ingrained generational trauma inflicted upon many by late capitalism. us humans are much more deeply flawed and rather clueless— not to mention downright animalistic— than we’d like to think. it’s reasons like this that i don’t quite believe that free will exists. 

remember, do not hate the people, hate the military-industrial complex, hate the institution, hate the systems we’ve created for ourselves and have failed ourselves with or, more classically said— don’t hate the player, hate the game."

SuicideWatch,fn60729,t3_fzt20n,1586682321.0,"hey man. i’ve been through exactly what youre talking about. honestly, what helped me most is finding some healthy distractions. find a youtube channel you think is really funny and watch all of it. find a netflix show. watch some movies, listen to some music. i also sleep a LOT. tea might help you calm down enough to. just try to escape your head, if only for a moment. and seek therapy. you may not be able to asap but many therapists are doing appointments online, if you can afford it. you’re going through a lot of anxiety right now and it’s a terrible feeling living that way. know that eventually you get control over it and it won’t feel so terrible forever. you can get through this. i believe in you. i’m sorry you’re feeling this way."

SuicideWatch,fn5zi4p,t3_fzt888,1586681552.0,"i know exactly how you feel. the people who love you most understand. it’s important to be patient with yourself. sometimes you feel like one more stupid mistake you might make will tip you over the edge, and then you make that mistake. and then you feel like pure fucking shit. and then in a day you’ve calmed down and it doesn’t feel like as much of a big deal anymore. life is so so so hard. but i guess we’ve just gotta take it day by day. maybe with time it’ll start to make sense. i believe in you."
