**[TCG]**

In an exciting update to the previous TCG drama, some cards from a future, unreleased set were leaked and revealed via people who stole stuff from printing factory, scheduled video uploads since NYTF, and retailers putting up product images. This angered some people from a certain group. Why? Because they outclassed many cards from before and has a massive powerboost. Due to distribution fuckery most people only have access to the first two sets, and other sets were distributed to swing state chains, influencers, and one LGS (more on this later). So a select few people are three card sets ahead of most  players. But that's not the main reason why the group was angry. They think this indicate the TCG won't live long, and more indication that the publisher truly thought the TCG as a side game. And now, the main social media manager is sick, so questions on the TCG went unanswered for almost a month now. And then...the LGS that actually can order product finally shipped out boxes. There was a massive delay due to, well, the world, and uncooperative publisher. Enough that the LGS declared they may never sell the TCG ever again. So who knows what's going to happen now.

edit: minor update!! another LGS that reached out got completely denied by the publisher to carry their games. This pleases no one, because that means only one LGS was ever carrying products, and we're about to lose that one too. Will the game survive this year?"

HobbyDrama,fo7epyo,t1_fo6b4io,1587577075.0,WW2 uniform drama is a rabbit hole. I remember someone local here got really angry when a con staff asked someone in full Nazi uniform to stop because it's not explicitly forbidden by the rules (and this is a con where wearing any current government clothing is forbidden).

In fact my problem with her isn't so much as these are inconsequential late retcons for points, but rather these are decisions made by other people like the casting directors and fandoms that she had no part in. You can't claim stuff other people did as you being inclusive."

HobbyDrama,fmqcwlw,t3_fv90ta,1586297253.0,"Another week, another minor drama in this [Name redacted] TCG:

To review, the publisher of the TCG has always maintained that the TCG is a side game and the main game has always been a toy game for kids. Several players in the community outright refused to take in that news, demanding anyone who bring it up to ""prove it"" despite the fact that the publishers actually directly addressed one of the players in their answer. Anyways, the card game depends on physical toys, and due to Trump screwing around a large wave of toys didn't ended up being made, but cards were already printed, so players have cards they couldn't use. To the rest of the playerbase this isn't a large issue because the cards that couldn't be used are mediocre to bad and doesn't affect the meta game that much, and unfortunately elections have consequences and this is one of the things the publisher doesn't have control over. Except for those several players mentioned before. This was a huge deal to them. For the past several months they have demanded the publishers to formulate a solution. Finally, the publisher said something last week, and the answer is no, because the TCG is a side game and it's not worth the effort to address an issue that doesn't affect the metagame. The players went ballistic with calls to drop the game. The rest of the players didn't care that much because well, there's a pandemic going on with juicier, more important drama. Truly a hobby drama, indeed."
