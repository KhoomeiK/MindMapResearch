I'm trying to figure out how much in student loans I'll need for the entire year and am unsure if I am reading it wrong. Does this cost include room and board?

I was awarded a Cal Grant for the amount of $14,242 and am wondering how that will play out for the total cost.

Can someone help me with a breakdown here?"
