COVID19positive,fpefxs7,t1_fpddx2m,1588546784.0,"Is being tested for antibodies and being tested for covid19 the same thing? I live in Los Angeles and we can get free tests now, regardless of your status as an essential worker and/or showing symptoms for the virus. I'm curious if I have the antibodies. I don't suspect that I've had covid19, but just curious. So my question is, if I go to get tested, does it say if I have antibodies?"

In order to get accepted, I did a master's at a local 4-year institution, where I had to hustle, get straight As, attend conferences, push out publications, gather research assistant experience, get awards and scholarships, and generally kick ass. Without doing this, there would have been no way I would be in my current PhD program. It's possible!!"

sociology,fni0g4i,t3_g1rr66,1586971883.0,"It sounds like she's mad that you're using your education. No? Maybe your citations are challenging her and she's not comfortable with that? 

Though you could be talking about the debate between agency and structure. As examples: a person might argue that it's up to the poor to work hard, go to school, and you can get a better life. This is taking your own agency into hand to succeed. Some people argue that there are too many barriers in place, like racism, lack of health care, and other structures in place that make climbing out of poverty a problem. One is a debate for agency, one is a debate for structure. 

Or, if you want to delve even deeper, you can [check out this podcast](http://sociocast.org/podcast/neurosociology-with-rengin-firat/) on neuro-sociology! It explains how our brains are indeed hard-wired to think certain ways -- yes, you can be hard-wired to be a racist! But, even the wirings in our brains can change if you try to change yourself. Listen to the podcast, it's fascinating and Dr. Firat is doing some crazy things in sociology using MRIs. (crazy good). 

Also, if I read between the lines here, maybe you're talking about all the dead white-dude classical theorists? I mean, their works are still relevant, which is why we read them still, BUT they're also written to be Euro, white, male-centric., so there is a lot missing from their conversation. It's okay to take the good and leave the bad when it comes to the classical theorists. In fact, if you want reading lists that showcase intersectionality and are inclusive, just holler and we can all help you find articles that you can agree."

sociology,fnfqf9u,t3_g1gd6j,1586913308.0,"Everything is political these days: gender and sexuality could be political, race and class could be political, criminology or even med soc (medical sociology) could be political.... Your question could be a bit more focused on what exactly you're interested in learning.

But, in sociology, there's a sub genre called **Political Economy.** There is another sub genre called **World-Systems.** The first is more focused on transnational politics (think globalization and social change). The second is a more historical approach to understand how political regemes come to be. 

For example, read the chapter titles of this [book, called Social Change.](https://books.google.com/books/about/Social_Change.html?id=mv1YCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button) As you see, this textbook outlines the politics of the world throughout history (it's a world-systems book). 

I'm a PhD student of sociology and I specialize in political economy. If you could tell me what you mean by politics, I could recommend some authors or articles and point you to where you're thinking.

--also, lots of the comments say to read Max and Weber. This is classical theory, and they can certainly be applied to politics and be political, just like race, gender, crim, labor, blah blah..  all the sub genre of sociology *could* be political, but classical theory is classical theory (yes, I'm looking at you du Bois and Goffman and functionalism and positivism and all these recommendations). They're not the same thing as *studying polity.*"
PhD,fnagon1,t3_g0jw15,1586797189.0,"Vocabulary.com has GRE vocab word lists. Play when you're on the couch watching Netflix. Also, I made flash cards for vocab and carried them everywhere and used them any time I wasn't doing something important. I also did the $199 4-month GRE online practice test account thingy from The Princeton Review. I called them up and said I couldn't afford the $199 and they gave me a $50 discount. I shared this account with 2 other students and we split the costs. The only way it helps is if you actually spend the time practicing."
sociology,fn9dx7l,t3_g04asn,1586769207.0,"Formal can be as simple as making an outline of basic info you want to grab when you go into the field. Things like: date, time, place, who are the people there, what are they wearing (is that relevant?), Weather, duration of visit, actions of participants there, what did you capture, which tools did you bring, blah blah blah... Whatever's relevant to your observation. You create a template and use it every time you go. Depending on your field, maybe you're a geologist and you need to record rock samples, or maybe you're a sociologist doing observations of a roller derby and you need to record the teams and scores or how many times you witnessed an offensive tackle. I'm making stuff up. Point is, formal observation has a structure. Put whatever info you think you need to gather onto a list and leave room to fill it out when you're in the field.

Informal observation can be simply going and recording notes of what you see without having this template in mind beforehand. 

I find it's easy to just say you're doing ""semi structured observation"" and still have an outline of what info you want to grab and still have wiggle room to add to it as you go. This way you're not being unethical either way."
