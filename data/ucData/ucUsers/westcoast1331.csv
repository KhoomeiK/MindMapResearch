LawSchool,fpaume8,t1_fpag7d4,1588456044.0,"Thank you for your thoughtful response. However, I find her reasoning to be very simplistic and fails to really deal with the repercussions of her ""tiger-style"" parenting. Specifically, in my own experience, I've seen this style of parenting lead to heightened anxiety, severe bouts of depression, very low self-esteem, and lots of unresolved emotions. Further, her advice seems against the overwhelming majority of the field of child development. 

I have a small daughter (post toddler) and it's just hard for me to imagine making her cry simply to teach her a lesson. However, I do try to balance that against me trying to have high expectations and embuing a 'can-do' attitude in her.  

In sum, I think you can get the same result with more positive parenting, which can limit the said implications of her parenting style."

The jobs that the protesters are aching to return to, don't really care about their person or their family.

news,fowm5ol,t1_fouyueq,1588122512.0,"That's absolutely not true. The whole field of psychiatry has not reached anything even remotely close to a consensus. There's actually a whole slew of credible researchers who have found that these drugs have some pretty devastating effects over the long term. But that doesn't fit the narrative of there being convenient solutions to mental health issues. 

These drug therapies are barbaric and operate on very flawed science and assumptions. The brain is not so simple that you can just add some serotonin and reach an optimal outcome. The pain and trauma that caused the unrest and depression will remain with you until you work to resolve it.  

I am glad that those drugs helped you through a rough period and they kept you alive. However, in my own life, they just repressed and allowed the underlying trauma to fester. I was on them for 3 years of my life and in that time my life was ruined. One year later and I'm still picking up the pieces and trying to forgive myself for the things I did to many people who I loved and lost. 

I will never get those years back. Unfortunately, many of those who are put on antipsychotics will suffer in ways they never thought possible."

The NCBE has said that they are uncertain that they can provide questions for an online bar, so we have to deal with that uncertainty. 

Also, the elephant in the room isn't being addressed and that's students who are going to have every incentive to be dishonest.

During any given bar administration, it's inevitable that a small number of students are going to cheat. However, I think it's very reasonable to assume that a much-much larger number of students are going to cheat on the exam this time around."
