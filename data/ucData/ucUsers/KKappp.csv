CallOfDutyMobile,fmwuzit,t1_fmwofyl,1586453506.0,"That’s not the definition of a prequel. A prequel has to be set in the same universe and before the main events. Modern Warfare 2019 has nothing to do with the previous MW games. Okay, we still have the same characters and similar storyline aspects but it’s a re imagined universe (MW 2019), so it can be called a reboot. Check out Taylor Kurosaki or Joel Emslie’s  interviews, they keep using the word ‘re imagined’ to tell us how it’s a reboot. And have you even played the campaign or the game? You might understand what I’m saying if you give it a shot."
