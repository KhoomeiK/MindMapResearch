MERS, SARS, and COVID-19 are all from the viral family, Coronaviridae, so considering vaccines are not developed for them yet it is understandable for you to doubt the process. However, the comment on Common Cold is incorrect. It is often caused by the family of viruses, Rhinoviridae, and yes we do have vaccines for it, but this viral family has hundreds of strains you would need a vaccine for each in order to ""cure"" the common cold, thus we don't have all the vaccines needed to rid get of it. 

For the flu, often coming from the Orthomyxoviridae family, they also have a vaccine, hence why you get your yearly shot. But the reason you get it yearly is because it's all based on which strains the CDC believes will become an issue, and thus they distribute a vaccine for those specific strains and hope enough people get vaccinated so it doesn't spread.

Now mind you, viruses can mutate, and thus even if you vaccinate once for a strain, there is a chance it will mutate, become different, and become an issue again. Everytime that happens, you need to make a new vaccine, which can be a pain in the ass to do depending what you are working with. As Jeff Goldblum put it best ""Life, uh... finds a way"""

I took the class and ended up with an A-, and all I did to prepare for midterms was study up on the statistical formulas Prof. Matthieu mentioned and remember basic matlab commands. Application of them was kept pretty basic, and as long as you understood the broad concept of what was being tested you should be fine.

Send me a direct message if there's something specific you don't get. He tests to see if you understand the formulas and when to use them, while overlaying a simple situation to make it applicable."
