ucla,fp8cvgh,t1_fp7w6es,1588389147.0,"I don't know what the technical issue was so it's hard to answer, but it sounds like it didn't submit until after the deadline so there is a chance something will go wrong. You're not necessarily doomed though."

ucla,fow3xt3,t1_fow0y2q,1588112560.0,Is there any event in particular that you want to find? Or are you just salty that one number is larger than the other
ucla,fow3qds,t1_fow12nw,1588112449.0,Major? (at Cal / UCLA)
ucla,fot8obe,t1_fot4h9s,1588047229.0,you might have trouble if you're above some credit maximum. More information specific to switching into the major should be on the department website
ucla,foozvdl,t1_fooe20e,1587949997.0,Probably not.
ucla,fokjbfa,t1_fok0ntc,1587843124.0,There's pretty much a 100% chance this is off the table
ucla,fohpnwo,t1_fohp64j,1587770226.0,"I have no idea what you mean by ""target school,"" but UCLA is considered one of the best universities in the US so you definitely will have that as an advantage in the job market. More important though is that you actually work to build your resume while in college, as course work != work experience."

ucla,focs8z7,t3_g6ueox,1587675167.0,"Bro it doesn't even say that. 

""We are working closely with our local public health officials to determine when we will resume in-person instruction. At this time we donâ€™t have an estimated date."""
ucla,fo3odx2,t3_g5bcsd,1587490281.0,"A USAC opinion that doesn't implicitly call me a racist? I can't express my relief. 

I'm glad to see with my own eyes that fiscal responsibility and the want for social change can coexist in USAC."

ucla,fnohhis,t3_g2z1uh,1587125182.0,"If they are truly your friends then they wouldn't push you to the brink of financial collapse. I'd say go for it, feel free to say no to spending money going out, and worst case scenario you'll just find friends elsewhere. It's very rare to have friends to dorm with as a Freshman anyway, at least your roommates will be friendly."

ucla,fmabfy2,t1_fmaa1sr,1585888911.0,"That's actually a myth that it shows up as a C. It isn't that simple in reality. They will consider whether the class it was relevant to your major or to their program, whether you seem like you can handle that course or if p/np was your only choice, as well as your course load that quarter and other factors.

They would obviously also consider if there was a global pandemic and you might have had more on your mind than class."
