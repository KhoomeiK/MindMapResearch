A little bit of sugar is not harmful, but there is no way to know what a safe sugar allocation is for your bun. Therefore, if we want our rabbits to be healthy and happy, alternative treats like fresh oregano or parsley, or the leaves of carrots are better, than sugar treats"

Instead, if things seem particularly hairy I reach out to the student and ask how I can help. In undergrad, I needed help because of my mental illnesses. I try to return the favor in these trying times.

I’m thinking about polling my students on how they feel right now using google as an anonymous poll.

Things that work in vitro often don’t work in vivo. Also, we need to weigh the impact of the drug’s side effects on someone with Covid-19 before deploying anything. 

Yes, we need emergency fda approval when a drug is more likely to be able to treat Covid-19. 

This is still early days. And deploying a drug that doesn’t work or just barely works too soon can lead to more deaths than not doing so.

CollegeRant,fnau62l,t1_fnatdk7,1586803883.0,"Well an AA is for transferring, so depending on the caliber of the school less than a 3.5 is sometimes fine. 

That depends on you. It depends on your aptitude compared to the average student. It depends on your intuitive talents in those fields. It depends on how quickly you assimilate and apply info. 

So here’s a checklist for UCLA 3.5 High Probability: Also, note this is for political science and economics 

Do you feel you get high grades without studying? 

Can you study and have the humility to study?

How creative are you? 

Do you feel you’re more academic than your peers? 

Are you actually more academic than your peers? 

Do you enjoy or feel overwhelmed by loads of assignments? 

How good of a writer are you? 

Do you love your major?"

CollegeRant,fnapgw3,t3_g0n5cy,1586801520.0,"I go to UCLA. In my field we have this distro most commonly a or a +, 10%, a-20%, b+ 10%, b 5%, b- 5% , c+ 5% c 25%, c- 10%, d 10%, F not sig 

Or for popular classes around 50% get some type of A and the scale ends at C. 

There’s a lot of competition, but frankly getting above a 3.5 is easy as long as you do a little critical thinking and answer the prompt with what professors are looking for. 

Even people at top universities lack creativity and intuition. Even if they can memorize answers. Btw this is only true for the humanities. 

High paying Employers generally care about how your ba taught you to think more than how much you know about x y z. 

So they’ll use a gpa filter to recruit candidates with the best critical thinking and ingenuity. 

Or they don’t and one has below a 3.5. As long as they see these qualities in an interview it doesn’t matter what your gpa is."
