I don’t think it’s spam if it fits in each community he’s crossposting to. LinkedIn is literally about self-promotion. Having a Patreon is not a bad thing, and if you think it is, you should be angry at a LOT of content creators. And that doesn’t read like a threat to me, it seems like he’s saying don’t be an asshole to people online because they might be your mom or some shit - and he didn’t even delete it?

He seems like a typical YouTuber. And it’s kind ironic that you spam this on all his posts lol."

UCSantaBarbara,fmloa2l,t1_fmjvlrz,1586190192.0,"Yeah, for real. I’m not even Econ, I have no stake in this, and that’s a fuckin bullshit email. They’re trying to pin blame on policy and the university. This is an exceptional time and the university has offered a blanket alternative. They need to at least take responsibility for their decision."
