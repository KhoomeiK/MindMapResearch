It allows those that are struggling with whatever to focus on their life without the pressure of keeping grades up. Will this lead to grade inflation? Yes, but this isn’t a normal quarter. It isn’t a normal quarter for most university students in the country. Grad schools will be aware of this, and many have already acknowledged that winter/spring 2020 will be handled differently due to the circumstances."
