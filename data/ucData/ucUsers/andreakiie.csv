ucr,fpie2mo,t3_gdlazq,1588639002.0,"Like what everyone said, and this applies to every school not just UCR, its what YOU make out of it. I did not like UCR in the beginning but I came to love it in a few months and now I miss campus :,( definitely recommend being involved, in anything that interests you. Whether that is a club, organization, program, job maybe? but yeah, ucr is also really diverse, which was one of the reasons why i chose this school, lots of people from different backgrounds. when i was an incoming high school student, this is what people told me and its what i’d tell anyone now"
ucr,fpapepn,t1_fpakp8v,1588452951.0,"yes, this was the end of fall quarter, going into winter quarter. once your proff submits the grade change, it will take about a week, thats how long mine took. i contacted my advisor too and he said he couldn’t do anything unless the proff submitted the grade change, but my advisor was kind enough to say that if my proff didnt respond, he will reach out to my proff to make sure he wasnt being salty lol, but just know if you have proof, then they have no reason to not submit a grade change"
ucr,fpadd9f,t3_gcapz9,1588445825.0,"This happened to me before, if there is proof then contact her. If she does not respond, contact registrar? i believe only the teacher can submit the grade change form, but definitely keep contacting your proff, maybe even attend her office hours lol"
ucr,fp8w6fu,t3_gbbjyv,1588405107.0,"i was on the waitlist last year as well, heard back in may. don’t get your hopes up! if you’ve already emailed and called, i think its just the waiting game now"
ucr,fp8d8d0,t1_fp8a838,1588389395.0,"you get it even if you’re a dependent :) , i was sad i didnt get the stimulus bc i was filed as a dependent but hey, this CARES act is good enough"
fatestaynight,fowg852,t1_fos042y,1588119165.0,"English lol, uni to be specific"
fatestaynight,fot21p6,t1_fosge79,1588042901.0,"Thanks! Yeah rider said it in episode 2, but as i watch, i see its not just one power, but maybe they’re just separate skills, like someone mentioned"
fatestaynight,forujb1,t1_fortivf,1588018753.0,"Thanks for the clarification. My project is about choosing someone (real/made up) and making them a heroic spirit. The thing is the person i chose is a superhero and has multiple powers (flying, super strength, telekinesis, mind erasing ...) so idk if that broke rules for powers, because when i was watching, Rider mentioned servants cant have more than one noble phantasm. But it makes more sense now with everyone’s replies."
fatestaynight,fortlrk,t1_fort382,1588018289.0,Ohh okay that makes so much sense thanks!
fatestaynight,forrorb,t1_forqwp7,1588017331.0,where can I find that? sorry im new to this
fatestaynight,forrmkp,t1_forqln0,1588017300.0,just fate zero please :)
ucr,forpa28,t3_g8yd4o,1588016113.0,"say it louder for the teachers in the back :,) all the things he mentioned are so valid. so many students are struggling with everything that has been going on on top of the pandemic. many, like I, are struggling in an environment that we can't study in. shoutout to this guy"
Tenant,folk97k,t1_fol534z,1587864045.0,"Nothing plugged in, we turned off all the switches in the breakers so we should not be charged. On my bill theres a city fee of about $30, and im just assuming thats a mandatory fee but the rest, im just confused because our bill is pretty much the same as we are usually charged when we are in the house. Im a college student, no job, paying for this myself. I just dint know if it is reasonable that i am being charged all of this and its normal or if i need to consult my city utility center"
ucr,fnx9q66,t3_g4e0lh,1587334274.0,"im under their contract too. still paying rent even tho i dont live there smh, i worked on campus too so now im not getting paid but im still obligated for rent."
ucr,fnsys8v,t3_g3bx54,1587231365.0,"do you guys remember what was on it, like concept wise. like was it just really knowing all the stuff he talked about and applying that to the questions, type beat?"
ucr,fn2kvw5,t3_fyv5rt,1586592798.0,It’ll be a lil easier for u since you’re already in bcoe but yea CS is competitive but as long as you’re taking the classes needed to switch im sure you’ll be able to
ucr,fmu0me2,t3_fxe9m5,1586382376.0,"depends where your planning to live and how often you go out. if you live on campus i think you’ll be fine. if you live off campus, and plan to go out a lot for lets say groceries and stuff then you will want to be more safe, carry pepper spray ya know. i live off campus from UCR, but close enough i walk to school. i have my car and go out like 1-3 times a week usually to get groceries/shop/ eat out... and I have had some instances where i did not feel safe. One time, i was getting gas and i got back in my car and was leaving the gas place, i had my windows rolled down bc it was a hot day and these two guys in skateboards (maybe like 25 years old) started basically cat calling me, then i started rolling down my windows bc i did not feel safe and as they skated past my car, they hit my windows bc they were “offended” i had started rolling up my windows. if you are going to live off campus always be safe and cautious, especially at night. try to have someone with you when going out."
ucr,fmlnuez,t3_fvtpgi,1586189974.0,"ucr also has a tutoring program called the ARC, i went there all the time the past few quarters. you can get tutoring and help from any subject, i always went there for math. its usually in skye hall, but this quarter they’re holding sessions on zoom. highly recommend, they helped a lot and got me through classes! take advantage of free tutoring! i took 9A last quarter, and if i’m not wrong you guys are using the APEX textbook. its accessible online as a pdf, just look it up, and read the book"
ucr,fmlngw7,t3_fw1bre,1586189784.0,"the well, i believe you can go there for self care stuff. they offer workshops on general wellness, mental heath, sexual health, drugs/alcohol, counseling... etc. ucr also allows for i think 8 free sessions to talk to a psychologist. i’m sure theres more haha but those are some i know. oo and ARC tutoring, for almost any subject, its usually in skye hall but now they’re doing it on zoom"
ucr,fmaqte8,t3_fty2k5,1585904147.0,"this is my current situation rn too, i have the exact classes just diff math and english. I just added my english this week, but honestly chem and bio seems already stressful so idk if i should drop my english and take it at a later time and just focus on the three"
