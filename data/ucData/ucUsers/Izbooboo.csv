berkeley,fnjx2yp,t3_g25g45,1587009055.0,Talk to your landlord. I was in an identical situation and my landlord amended my lease and allowed me to get out early. It was one act of sincere kindness and she just as well could’ve legally held the lease.
berkeley,fn2jk7r,t3_fyv3hp,1586591359.0,"All admissions are conditional. Run it by your admissions officer before you make any choice. In your email, don’t blame the professor. It may come across poorly/as immature. Make sure it doesn’t affect ur igetc also. Berkeley can be a stickler on that one"
berkeley,fn2jd1j,t3_fyveg5,1586591147.0,"Plenty of incredible students get rejected in college admissions. Honestly your resume sounds too good to be true. The number of activities seems astronomical.  They may have seen your application as spreading yourself too thin. Many high schoolers have trouble presenting the depth of their activities. Which may or may not have been the case in your application. And to be honest, in your reddit post you come across as entitled and possibly a little privileged. It sounds like you’ve had access to a lot of incredible things so your essays regarding overcoming barriers may have come across as disingenuous. Regardless, I would appeal and see what they say. 
I understand you might take offense to some of the things I’ve said. While hard to hear, it may have been what the admissions office saw in your application. You sound like a hardworking person who pulled the short straw when it comes to admissions. Same shit happened to me with my freshman admissions decisions. It sucked and REALLY hurt. I felt like I had lost my identity as a good hard working studious person without a prestigious admission under my belt. Frankly it took me a long time to bounce back. But, now I’ve transferred into Berkeley. Freshman admission is not the only road to Berkeley. Don’t give up now."
