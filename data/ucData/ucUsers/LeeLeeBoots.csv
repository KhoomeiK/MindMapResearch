I do think so much of the switch to online learning has been poorly done by universities, & some of the professors from what I hear on Reddit have been real jerks about it, so maybe you are just already so done with it all?

I'm an educator (not at university level) & it has been incredibly challenging to learn new platforms, & to find people in my home to video me (when it is not screencastify). Sometimes I am almost through recording a 20 min lesson, and at the very end I misspeak or think I didn't press record & I gasp (and the gasp is on the video!!) & I must delete & start all over. It can take me 2 - 4+ hours to create a 20 minute presentation. So if I ever were to go over by 10% of my allotted time, but that was the take where I finally got everything right & explained the concept(s) really well, I will be uploading that slightly longer one."

DixieFood,fn2bh4o,t1_fn24139,1586583424.0,"His version on the Rock Island bkog, he changed the crunchy shell to a shiny ganache (smooth bit gooey chocolate glaze), he said to be easier to slice - and he also wasn't a fan of the crunchy shell, I think. Here's a link to his recipe:

I hope I'm allowed to post links? His cake looks so good!"
DixieFood,fn230t0,t1_fn22klm,1586576502.0,"Well, others say MA. Maybe I got mixed up, proabbaly. Maybe that Vermonter just perfected the recipe or headed the company during an expansion? I remember vividly because I took a photo of his ""famous"" star photo/clipping, since our 10 year old daughter is obsessed with marshmallows!"
DixieFood,fn22rrk,t1_fn19kkv,1586576315.0,"Oh, that's a good story! Thank you for sharing."
DixieFood,fn22qlt,t1_fn0egdv,1586576292.0,"Oh, weird. I saw the inventors photo in Vermont on a Wall of Fame. But maybe he lived in MA when he invented it? Or maybe he was the guy that perfected itnor renamed itnor something?"
DixieFood,fn22klm,t1_fn0trep,1586576170.0,"Yes, that is what everyone is saying. I actually know where it is invented, I think. We visited a private school in Vermont, and on a wall with famous alumni there was a photo of an older man (next to another photo, that one of a famous rock star alum), but this guy being famous for inventing marshmallow fluff! 

But I didn't know what region it is most commonly a food people eat. Now I'm sure it is Canada and New England :-)"
DixieFood,fn227k1,t1_fn0vii6,1586575909.0,"Thank you for your reply. I am going to categorize it as New England, most likely, but maybe Canada. Thank you again for your help."
DixieFood,fn21h97,t1_fn1ypfa,1586575368.0,"Thank you for your reply.

New England it is."
DixieFood,fn21fqx,t1_fn1ncx0,1586575337.0,"That is a very good reply!! :-) For sure I am not categorizing it as Southern now! I just know Southern people like sweet things, so I guess I assumed. Gonna go with New England, I think."
DixieFood,fn217wa,t1_fn1bshz,1586575180.0,"That makes sense. The blog that sent me searching for fluff recipe is by a Newfoundler. He had a copycat or reinterpretation recipe for ""Jon Louis cake"" that he said is like our ding dong min-chocolate-cake. Did you grow up eating that?  

Thanks for the info! :-)  I have a ""Canada"" category too."
DixieFood,fn20lqa,t1_fn16cxy,1586574733.0,"Oh, thank you! I didn't know that!"
Costco,fmwsimd,t3_fxp17z,1586452253.0,Love it!!
