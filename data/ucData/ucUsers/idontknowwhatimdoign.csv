ucla,fpjb2g9,t1_fpj5h70,1588662184.0,"This quarter for PhySci 5, we can‚Äôt even turn in the workbook and reading the course reader isn‚Äôt that great either. I essentially had to pay 100+ for an online program thats like 30 bucks. What a scam. I hate that place tbh"
ucla,fphdhyn,t3_gdhnkg,1588619338.0,"It‚Äôs not necessarily about taking core classes in the summer, it‚Äôs about showing that you‚Äôre able to handle a large workload during a regular quarter. Med schools generally don‚Äôt like you taking core classes during the summer because they think that you‚Äôre doing it because you want to spread out classes and aren‚Äôt able to handle a large workload. As long as you show that you can handle a large workload, you should be fine taking core classes during the summer."
ucla,fpdxk71,t1_fpdwl18,1588536241.0,"I mean, I don‚Äôt regret choosing UCLA at all, but I do regret choosing my major just because it means I have to take the harder chem and math series. If there‚Äôs anything I wish I knew it‚Äôs that you should choose a life science major to keep your GPA higher. Try to take the Chem 14 series and LS 30 Math series, they‚Äôre soooo much easier than the Chem 20 and Math 31 series I had to take. 

Volunteer opportunities are abundant too. I was going to start volunteering at three hospitals before the quarantine and I was doing research on neurons in lab. The research portal makes it a bit easier to look for research opportunities, and the prime time to apply is during spring/summer of freshman year because you have a bit of lab experience under your belt and you‚Äôll be able to be in the lab for like three years if you want"
ucla,fpdvfig,t3_gcwlxh,1588535025.0,"Honestly, as premed, I would say to go to the school that gives you the highest GPA. There are a bunch of opportunities for volunteering and research here, and most students probably end up being involved in one or the other. Having a hospital on campus helps, and you can def find a professor to do research with. I‚Äôm not sure about the opportunities at UCSD, but if they‚Äôre comparable, I would say to go to the school that you think you would get the better GPA at"
ucla,fp77tbt,t1_fp77alz,1588365617.0,"Just don‚Äôt worry about it. Sociology 1 is intro to Soc, you‚Äôll be fine. Chem 14A is basic gen chem, way easier than Chem 20A already. Just enjoy your time before you start classes. If you really really want the syllabi though, you can find them online"
ucla,foraa1r,t3_g94p9l,1588008831.0,"Majoring in music takes a lot of time. There‚Äôs a lot of time that you need to put into your classes and practicing outside, but it‚Äôs doable if you really want to do it. Applying to double major in music is different from other majors. You can only apply during the normal undergrad admissions time, you still need to interview and audition, send in samples, and do all of the other music application requirements. The music school is separate from Letters and Sciences, so it‚Äôs basically like applying to UCLA all over again, except that the music school is more competitive in terms of talent."

ucla,fo9fo3d,t1_fo9f3og,1587618220.0,"Three week summer session. Yes and yes. It still has all of the same material, just paced much faster. Might make it harder to understand if you don‚Äôt like bio, and you probably won‚Äôt remember much for the MCAT, but it‚Äôs still an option if you‚Äôre up for it."

ucla,fo0z9jg,t3_g52jyz,1587422615.0,It depends what classes. Are they major classes or GEs? Are they known for having a large workload or are they easy? Taking two GEs is super different from taking a CS and Chem class in one session

premed,fnfaegi,t1_fnf8fzy,1586904368.0,"We had an online orientation this morning, and they all basically involve some sort of patient interaction. ‚ÄúMenial‚Äù probably wasn‚Äôt the best way to put it, but I meant stuff like brining water to patients and checking in on them, asking them if they need anything, just generally talking to them. They also have more general programs that aren‚Äôt specific to departments, like a comfort dog program and a program where you take grieving families some comfort items when their family members pass away."
ucla,fncoe4b,t3_g0yvn3,1586842150.0,Why not just do Biochem? I‚Äôm not even sure you can double major in bio and chem (might be wrong though). There‚Äôs a decent overlap between upper div classes/electives so it will probably be a lot of work since you‚Äôll need to take separate courses

ucla,fn43otb,t1_fn41zlz,1586633418.0,"You can, and it will probably help you out if you take them in college. I know some schools require a year of Calc and a stats class, almost all of them require a year of English, but not many list psych as a requirement, the schools that do mention psych usually have it as a ‚Äúrecommended for the MCAT‚Äù course. You don‚Äôt need to take the classes, but it might be good for undergrad admission and just to get a rudimentary understanding of the topics."

It‚Äôs hard to train people in what they should be doing when the work is being done remotely. You can email them something about hopefully when the quarantine ends in the summer(? just to make it more general, and hopefully it does end in the summer) if you can join their labs. Don‚Äôt email them with the intention of starting during the quarantine; email them with the intention of starting as soon as the quarantine ends."

Sometimes lectures get confusing, but that‚Äôs philosophy for you if you‚Äôre not a philosophy major. The readings aren‚Äôt terrible, although I did stop reading around week 4 because I hardly understood anything and he goes very in-depth during lecture anyways. Discussion sections/TAs are very useful for the essays and they also go over the text very thoroughly! 10/10 class, would recommend. Kinda mad it didn‚Äôt count as a Writing II class that quarter though since I wrote over 20 pages worth of essay. It was pretty easy writing though!"
