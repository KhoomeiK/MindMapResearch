UCSD,fnqm7nh,t3_g39jb7,1587167430.0,One time during my first year it was raining insanely hard. I was in PC and had to get all the way back to revelle (without an umbrella). I remember throwing on my head buds and sprinting through that rain back to my dorm having so much fun even though I was soaked to the bone
