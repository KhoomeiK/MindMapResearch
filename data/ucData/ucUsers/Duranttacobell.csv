berkeley,fpeh1xo,t3_gcvqov,1588547400.0,"Okay, so, given that we're at a pretty special and reputable university, one of the best in the country, I have found it common to observe that, regardless of where I go outside of Berkeley, people generally react with admiration and praise upon learning where I go to school. For instance, it is not uncommon for me to observe in folks displays of pleasant surprise, rising eyebrows in admiration, or for them to mouth the words ""wow,"" denoting, obviously, an acknowledgement of Berkeley's academic pedigree, reputation and all the implications about one’s personal ability, intelligence and IQ that accompany attendance here.

I've grown accustomed to these reactions. I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel little endorphin rush each time I received such praise. If I’m being completely honest, I seek opportunities where I can name-drop Cal into conversations with individuals whom I’ve just met so that it raises my personal stock in their eyes. After all, it feels good to be smart and be acknowledged as such. Usually, simply uttering the name Berkeley is all it takes for the person I’m speaking with to change their disposition and begin treating me with a little more respect.

This is the case about 90% of the time.

The other 10% can be divided into two cases: people who don’t know much about college rankings or colleges in general, and the second group is UCLA students. Typically, these people will learn that I am a Berkeley student and not bat an eye or show any added respect. The person in the former group will simply ask what I'm studying, usually. I don't take offense to these folks because I attribute their reactions simply to a lack of information. The latter group, however, the Bruins, tend to say things like, “Cool, what are you studying there?” or “How do you like it there?” or “What’s your major?” without any facial expressions that convey acclamation for the fact that I attend Cal.

In fact, I can’t think of a time when a Bruin treated me with the same instant high-esteem I’d expect from 90% of people I encounter. This is starting to bug me more and more given that they're obviously familiar with UC Berkeley and what kind of institution it is. Whereas the first group's excuse is that they are simply ignorant on the subject, I haven't figured out why UCLA kids don't react the same way as students from other UCs and the general population.

I have probably encountered dozens of students, throughout my travels across the state during my three years at Cal, from every UC campus. All across the board, from UC Merced to Riverside and even UCSF, students from these campuses show instant respect and display kudos and are generally impressed when they learn that I’m a Golden Bear. This is true for every campus except UCLA.

And I’m left wondering: Do you think they do this on purpose? What possible reason could they have for not reacting like 90% of the population does? It’s pretty perplexing. It’s been bothering me lately—particularly because I went back to visit my grandparents in SoCal over break and ran into UCLA students all over LA county. Their reactions, upon hearing what school I attend, showed the same neutral faces or light smiles as before I uttered the Berkeley name. Their orientation to me didn’t change at all. There were no raised eyebrows accompanied by ""oohhs."" To be honest, I'm not used to this.

When I meet a UCSD student, for example, they typically show a lot of respect and their faces light up. Many of them become excited with lots of questions about attending Berkeley; barring that I have somewhere to be, I tend to stick around, sharing what life is like at Cal. But with UCLA students, I never experience this at all. I feel like maybe they don’t know their place in the pecking order? I understand if this comes off as super petty and perhaps a little pretentious, but I wanted to see if anybody has had a similar experience. If so, what did you do about it?"
