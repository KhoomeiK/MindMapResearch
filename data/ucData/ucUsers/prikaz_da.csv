If we were to do this in English, we'd write things like _The man, I met yesterday, is named Michael,_ with commas on either side of _I met yesterday._ We consider this wrong, not because it is universally wrong to put commas in those positions, but because we aren't taught to do it or exposed to that usage in the sources we take as models for our own usage."

For now, I'd second /u/freezoneandproud's recommendation to not worry about the meter. Solo auditing _is_ a thing, but not one you can do easily at this stage. To give you some context, in the CoS, you don't learn to solo audit until you're either Clear or very nearly there. At that point, you have to do TRs and either the HQS course (an optional, introductory training course) or Academy Level 0 (the first ordinary learn-to-audit course, which requires TRs and a metering course) if you haven't already done them.

You can also find metering course materials online (surprise!). An independent org called the Advanced Org of the Great Plains has put out a [free video](https://vimeo.com/65361540) that shows what the different meter reads look like. This won't be of much use to you yet, but you can bookmark it and save it for later.

If you're curious, another independent Scientologist who went by 'The Pilot' put out books called Self-Clearing and Super Scio—don't read this one yet—that you can find online. Obviously, these are not used in the CoS, and even most independent Scientologists don't attempt to go from square one to Clear on their own. Both have received considerable praise. Super Scio assumes you are farther along and contains a lot of OT-type materials. You will be better off not reading it until you're eventually ready to work with them. Self-Clearing is safe to read now. You can try it without a meter, as it doesn't even mention the meter until chapter 22, and then as an optional (but helpful) tool."

>I was going to start Self Analysis after finishing Dn but I'm not firm on that plan.

Self Analysis is a good book. You'll likely revisit it often, alone or with someone else who could benefit from it. Lists from the book are used in metered auditing, too, but it's designed to be easy to do without one.

If you don't know your Study Tech, take some time to learn it now. Much of it seems simple—because it is—but it'll help you work your way through lectures and books. You don't want to spend an hour reading, pass something you didn't really get, go on autopilot, and come out realizing you learned nothing. The Scientology Handbook website has [the essentials of Study Tech](http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/study/sh1_1.htm) for you to read. It's a CoS site, but it's free and it doesn't ask you for any information.

>as an essential worker when dealing with others trying to focus on ARC 

That's good. Are you familiar with the TRs? If not, you probably have already downloaded a TR course pack. They're drills to teach effective communication. Even if you don't have someone to practice them with at home, read the materials on them.

OutOfTheLoop,foetuk6,t1_foe9npk,1587714554.0,"There are actually broad spectrum disinfectants that kill many viruses and bacteria in one minute. Certain AHP (“accelerated hydrogen peroxide”) products do this. Use solutions of hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectants are very safe—for cleaning surfaces, not for drinking.

EDIT: I assume I'm getting downvotes because people think I support Trump's proposal to use disinfectants internally. I don't. I posted this because it seemed to me that some people didn't believe disinfectants could act that quickly. Disinfectants are for surfaces, not your lungs. Don't start inhaling AHP solutions, quaternary ammonium compounds, or any other surface disinfectant, folks."

Yes, put “wow” in the title. Everyone searches for that to filter out unimpressive items. /s"

russian,fob1j8l,t1_foauc6v,1587655053.0,"> I think this is quite similar to what Americans call ""coat check"".

Not at all. _coat check_ refers to a counter or small room in a place like a museum, theatre, or (upscale) restaurant where patrons can leave coats and other items while visiting the place. It is usually staffed by an attendant, who keeps track of the items' owners and ensures that items are returned to them when they leave. They usually also accept items like handbags.

The definition you copied is for a department or large room in a place like a TV production studio, playhouse, or opera house. It is not publicly accessible. Actors, TV presenters, and the like go there to retrieve the clothing they'll need for a performance or appearance. The performers in a play don't take their costumes home after the show—they go back to the _wardrobe._"

You seem to have figured out a bit of the structure of the window, since you know that `window 1` contains `scroll area 1`, which in turn contains `table 1`. I wrote a bit more about exploring the UI hierarchy from a script in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/applescript/comments/ezf14o/how_do_i_know_what_actions_an_application_can_take/fgor56o/?context=3). To refer to a UI element by name, you have to also know the names of all the objects above it. Here, you cannot simply

    click button ""Mouse Options…""

You must instead

    click button ""Mouse Options…"" of tab group 1 of group 1

If you had not nested the other actions in the `tell window 1` block, you would also need to add `of window 1` at the end. The sheet that comes down when you click the button is then `sheet 1 of window 1`, which contains your checkbox."

applehelp,fo6u7nu,t1_fo6tbml,1587566814.0,"No, the SMC reset requires holding down keys with the power button. The support page you linked even prefaces that step with “Before resetting the SMC, try these steps” and follows it with “If the issue persists, follow these steps to reset the SMC”. 

What’s interesting is that Apple recommends holding down the button *with the computer off* in that article. I was assuming that OP held down the button with the computer in the state shown in the photo, to force it to turn off. The fact that Apple then provides explicit SMC reset instructions means that merely holding the button down (and no keys) with the computer off doesn’t reset the SMC, so I wonder what that actually accomplishes.
