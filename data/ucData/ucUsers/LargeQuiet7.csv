UCSD,fp9kpjq,t3_gbyfmp,1588428627.0,I had several W and F grades from many years ago on my transcript and got into grad school just fine. One P/NP will be ok. Not everyone applies with a perfect 4.0 and not all perfect 4.0s get accepted. You will be ok.
90DayFiance,fp9jwtd,t1_fp8sqzu,1588428069.0,Pregnancy doesn’t give you baby hairs per se but you don’t shed as much hair when pregnant and many pregnant women say their hair is thicker and fuller because of it. Once you deliver it is common for hair to fall out in clumps over the coming weeks and months due to the hormones shifting back to normal especially if you breastfeed on top of that your hair is fucked. All my friends and I went through it. It sucks.
90DayFiance,fozt93l,t3_gahfu3,1588196461.0,I think it’s tribal differences. Michael is Yoruba and Usman is Hausa. Also Michael and Angela have talked about a surrogate which is probably an ok compromise for Michael’s family.
relationship_advice,fovdlxx,t3_g9pbol,1588099548.0,LEAVE. No questions asked. No excuse in the universe for a grown ass man beating a tiny dog to the point of breaking its bones. And for him to just let it suffer after and not get it help immediately shows how sick and callous he is.
90DayFiance,fovcgro,t1_fouls1r,1588099003.0,"Same. My son is my life now that he is here and everything I do is to make him happy, but if I knew then what I know now I would've never gotten pregnant. 

Its a thankless job and the most stressful, exhausting thing Ive ever done and my son is only 6!"
90DayFiance,forhj6g,t3_g95yeh,1588012334.0,She's a national treasure.
relationship_advice,for6cyv,t3_g8zgs7,1588006933.0,"4.5 is very extreme to not be potty training. CPS would have some questions about that honestly...its heading towards neglect. My son is 6yo and still wears pull ups to bed but stays dry at night 50% of the time. We're working on it. Not working on it at all is failing to address and meet a childs emotional and mental growth and needs. Its like saying ""Im not working on teeth brushing yet""...its a health issue its not really optional after a certain point.

Edited to add: my son has ASD"
90DayFiance,foquzrh,t3_g8uw54,1588001304.0,The mucinex blob isn't a germ...its a phlegm which is think is much more fitting for Ed.
Divorce,foqofop,t1_fooj7v9,1587997844.0,Thank you for reminding me it ok to be alone! It’s not a sad thing it’s just an individual choice. It sounds really great and I’m looking forward to it very much once this process is over :)
Divorce,foqobpg,t1_fop3b5u,1587997784.0,"Thank you. This was really helpful. I want to be my sons biggest advocate and not let anyone make him feel less than because he is different. He really is amazing. A very silly, whip smart kid and he deserves to be happy and have a happy mom."
Divorce,foqo542,t1_foofqba,1587997682.0,Thank you for the kind words. Yesterday was very raw but I woke up today and immediately read these comments and feel better about my decision. There is no playbook for life or love and I am just doing the best I can.
90DayFiance,fop9hzq,t1_fop5z58,1587956094.0,I was going to say this. She looks uncomfortable just having her hands on Erika at all.
90DayFiance,fo7iaow,t3_g61sdi,1587578807.0,"Fuck this guy.....thats rude as fuck.

He hurt her feelings and tried to pretend like it was her best interest.

Im fuming."
UCSD,fnzw6wy,t3_g4r2to,1587401807.0,You're 3000 and late.

90DayFiance,fnnhb1b,t3_g2hxx9,1587092364.0,"I would want to meet Pedro because I low key think he's really hot and I hate myself.

Alex and Loren (and BabyBrov)

Honestly, now that I think about it I think my dumb ass would legit like this."
relationship_advice,fnn7bs1,t1_fnn4500,1587085990.0,"I don’t know. He doesn’t really articulate it well. He has said “ I expected marriage to be like a 90s R&B song”... wtf does that even mean? 

I put on lingerie on occasion I bought 2 different sexy pieces for Valentine’s Day and brought one out a week or two early just for fun, I do go into the room where he is and sit next to him and snuggle up if we’re watching Netflix. I hug him randomly throughout the day it’s not like I am completely hands off and checked out I just don’t think I’m living up to this ideal in his head and it’s affecting both of our self esteems."
90DayFiance,fnn3h9w,t3_g2ompu,1587083606.0,BIG 3 kinda mood lately.
relationship_advice,fnn317r,t1_fnn2ahx,1587083339.0,"You just gave two wildly opposite pieces of advice. What kind of compromise would you suggest? I feel like no matter what, someone is going to feel shorted. Ultimatums are rarely good for relationships so I'd like to avoid that if possible."
relationship_advice,fnn2nv3,t1_fnn267q,1587083113.0,"He can't really explain it. He has said he had an ideal in his head from childhood about how marriage would be, but he never told me this for the entire 5 years until recently so I feel pretty bait and switched."
relationship_advice,fnn2fud,t1_fnn1zwg,1587082979.0,"I am very ""into him"". He is my husband. I've been devoted to him and we have built a great life together. What are you trying to say?"
90DayFiance,fnmlso5,t3_g2lxaz,1587073749.0,This is a MAJOR BOP. 100% Banger.
90DayFiance,fnlume3,t1_fnlht3h,1587060005.0,">Jenny is once again ready to move back to India for the love she believes is real.

This just sounded like suuuuuch shade to me. I almost spit out my coffee."
90DayFiance,fnfqab8,t3_g1hq0h,1586913224.0,its like a fucked up last supper.
90DayFiance,fnfp1ce,t3_g1gqnh,1586912485.0,"Thank you for sharing that. Its very valid and it shows you care about the situation, so I want to say I appreciate the validity of your concerns and sharing that with me because it shows you care about the situation."
90DayFiance,fnblc46,t1_fnb2swk,1586817574.0,Good lord the caption on one of the pics says Tom and Sister Tom are only 10 months apart in age!!!!! Irish twins! Their poor mother.
90DayFiance,fnbbnfv,t3_g0pm5i,1586812672.0,"I think its just their way of being passive aggressive like how in office emails ""as per my last email"" means ""can you fucking read you idiot?"". ""Best, Darcey"" really means ""Die Slowly, Darcey"""
90DayFiance,fnbbc5c,t3_g0ndv1,1586812513.0,Love some soft butch energy....looooove it.
NoStupidQuestions,fnb1zcf,t3_g0d2vv,1586807811.0,Literally why I can never finish watching Inception....its sooooo annoying to be straining to hear then having your eardrums blown out over and over again for 2.5 hours.
90DayFiance,fn8ogw5,t1_fn8o75t,1586746314.0,im def not on her side....shes been a frigid bitch the entire time. No ones saying eat Erika's box at the airport terminal but damn be nice and show a smidge of enthusiasm.
90DayFiance,fn8diey,t1_fn8d5dh,1586739223.0,I think the general consensus is that they put their finger over the phone camera to block the tv cameras and mics that have to inevitably be in the shot to film a FaceTime convo.
90DayFiance,fn59det,t3_fzn094,1586659098.0,"This seems to be basic human decency, but sadly its not."
UCSD,fmu39yg,t1_fmt8amc,1586383763.0,Someone in my cohort was just actually just on Jeopardy last month.. we were going to watch together as a class at Rock Bottom which shut down and then Corona happened so most of us watched it on YouTube tv with a free trial if you're interested in streaming.
90DayFiance,fmsmw9e,t3_fx2a12,1586358537.0,The family Chantel totally feel that because they have a bit of money they can treat people however they want. Money doesn't buy class and they are a perfect example.
FreeKarma4U,fk93mek,t3_fh2fvp,1583968035.0,upvoteeeeeee
