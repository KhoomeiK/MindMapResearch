Word from the inside is that the budget was deep in the red before COVID even hit, so I suspect the university will be doing everything it can to avoid staff/faculty cuts, with student support being a lower priority."

IMO it really highlights the Strength of the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  Data source is SODA3 ([https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds650.0/](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds650.0/)).  Visualization tool is NCL ([https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/))."
askmath,fibmhet,t3_f74gb4,1582325156.0,"So it's basically saying ""show that R\_ijkl as defined below satisfies R\_jk = g\^il R\_ijkl.""  So if you contract the below equation with g\^il show that you recover R\_jk.  Since I find it's often confusing to simultaneously contract two tensor indices, you might want to contract it with g\^ml at first then contract it with delta\^i\_m."
