UCDavis,fpjneug,t3_gd6xk4,1588674958.0,I'm a senior expected to graduate this Spring but I might have to take both summer sessions to graduate now. Lmao. I'm on the verge of failing all my classes this quarter.
UCDavis,fpjn7u4,t3_gdrpv3,1588674761.0,"If you want to spend every waking second of your summer slaving away to lectures and assignments, then yes.
Otherwise, it is generally not a good idea.
Unless you're really smart and on top of your shit, then maybe I guess it is manageable."
UCDavis,fpcetgd,t3_gbz4gw,1588497881.0,"Seems like UC Berkeley staff,chancellor,etc. are on top of their shit, already sending out info. on what is the plan for fall."
UCDavis,fpcemlo,t3_gcmt2e,1588497669.0,Bump. I'm using nasal spray and taking zrytec but sometimes it doesn't work. Willing to try out local honey.
galaxys10,fp9yati,t3_gbpiz9,1588437068.0,Have same issue. Most likely have to exchange the motherboard.
UCDavis,fp9xp0x,t3_gbon6n,1588436711.0,Allergies. It quite atrocious during spring quarter.
UCDavis,fp9wwqr,t3_gc8le0,1588436251.0,Au revoir!
UCDavis,fow6jal,t3_g9r3rx,1588113934.0,"Cheers for the useless update, Emily."
UCDavis,foszkfx,t1_forgpdq,1588041378.0,"Bro, I know, bro."

UCDavis,fopiz3p,t3_g8mkqt,1587962731.0,"Am not happy with the way ecs152a is being taught/run. But at the same time, I understand it is difficult for prof. and TAs given the current circumstances."
UCDavis,fop0xcy,t1_fonxwum,1587950652.0,"Story of my life. Always tell myself, ok, next time don’t procrastinate but I always find myself back at stressing over finishing assignments in time.
Rinse and repeat."
UCDavis,fon1kp1,t3_g76boe,1587910056.0,Weather in SB is really nice. That’s also one thing you shouldn’t underestimate. Weather in Davis is absolutely atrocious.
UCDavis,fon1aoj,t3_g88dhr,1587909853.0,Not a huge fan of this school but what choice to do I have when I’ll be graduating this summer.
UCDavis,fon179y,t3_g84sxq,1587909784.0,You’re not alone. I have 2 assignments dude tomorrow and I haven’t even started on them. Those two were assigned 2 weeks ago...
UCDavis,fo6kvon,t3_g4nhv0,1587561302.0,"On top of what liquefied-sky mentioned, given that UCD is a decent Bio school, CS with Bio would be good if it's not too taxing."
iran,fn8fifp,t3_g019vq,1586740483.0,California. Wasting my life on Reddit.
UCDavis,fn8f3pi,t3_fzndd2,1586740225.0,Linus Torvalds dislikes this post
UCDavis,fn8ezc7,t3_fzq5k9,1586740145.0,I personally code on a text editor and compile and run via terminal. But VS code is fine.
UCDavis,fn8ev2o,t3_fzq9eb,1586740067.0,I too am not really happy with how Trump is handling this (but s/o to Dr. Fauci) but my man taking matters into his own hands. Respeck!
UCDavis,fn8emqf,t3_g07cs1,1586739920.0,"CS != programming. That said, most cs classes require programming. On top of that, math. After all, cs is applied math. For ecs 120, 132, 122a/b, 127, 171, etc., they involve quite a bit of math. Classes like ecs150,140,154a,etc., not so much.

Since you’re bio systems eng., I suppose it’s not as difficult as switching from, say, psychology."
UCDavis,fmu7984,t3_fwhv86,1586385881.0,If I were you UCI. UCI has its own college called ICS.
UCDavis,fmttre2,t1_fmp1yty,1586378861.0,"A couple of reasons, but mainly due to the fact that I lack self-discipline."
UCDavis,fmttop4,t1_fmnx86r,1586378824.0,Lol. Sorry.

UCDavis,fmnsmp8,t3_fwcqn2,1586234144.0,I haven't joined any of the zoom meetings for my classes last week. I don't even know what is happening. I'm scared. It still feels like spring break.
UCDavis,fmjgxts,t3_fv94aq,1586130102.0,It is pretty time consuming if you're not well versed in those topics and if you're not familiar with MATLAB. If I were you I would either drop 171 or 174.
