UCSantaBarbara,fpc0j02,t1_fpbztyx,1588483811.0,"Doesn't seem like I'm getting through to you about the whole 'caring about other people's wellbeing' thing, so I'm not going to bother carrying on this conversation further. I hope you'll never have to watch a loved one suffer or watch someone mourn a loss due to this virus. But I'm sure it would change your mind."
music_survivor,fpbzi9i,t1_fpbz8ko,1588482945.0,"It seems like we have pretty different taste in general lol, didn't really like Magdalene much either but Igor was up there for me as well."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbzfth,t1_fpbz53t,1588482889.0,"It's not about ME being at risk. I'm one individual person taking my own precautions (getting groceries delivered, limiting my time outside and abiding by social distancing when I do so, etc.). The people who aren't social distancing are putting everyone they may be living with at risk even if those people are, like me and the majority of others, following the necessary precautions. You can't escape the virus when it's brought into your home. Innocent people who are following the rules we are supposed to be following are falling sick and dying because of people with your mindset."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbz2ow,t1_fpbyxvs,1588482588.0,What about putting other people at risk do you not understand?
music_survivor,fpbyvj1,t1_fpbycbd,1588482424.0,"I respect your opinion as well, but I just don't see it. I was hoping it would grow on me but it hasn't up to this point sadly."
UCSantaBarbara,fpbytm4,t1_fpbyev2,1588482380.0,"You and I may be fine, but there are people who go out and come home to their roommates or their families. They put other people's lives at risk, not just their own. That is why this is everyone's business and everyone's responsibility to keep people safe. Not everyone has a fully functioning immune system, not everyone is young like us, and it's frankly selfish to enable and accept the behavior we've been seeing. Heat may slow down the spread of the virus but it will certainly still thrive regardless of the summer. It's far too infectious for that to be possible."
UCSantaBarbara,fpby2cw,t1_fpbtcxo,1588481772.0,"I can't stand this mentality. It isn't snitching when the literal physical wellbeing of the community is at risk, it's a safety concern."
music_survivor,fpbxgyq,t1_fpavpf1,1588481306.0,I love Peggy but Cornballs was so underwhelming tbh
UCSantaBarbara,foxdfwq,t1_foxctdl,1588140678.0,"It's still one of the top UCs, and it's continuing to climb national and state rankings. The audience of students they're typing to largely shares a mental lexicon of current slang, so most people would understand that the comment isn't meant to be taken seriously. To be honest, a lot of what is said on this subreddit shouldn't be taken seriously because it's reddit, even if it's a school-based niche. Maybe slang like this doesn't resonate with you because it isn't what was used ""when you attended UCSB"", but it's a valid way of speaking. There's no point in acting holier-than-thou. I hope I was able to get my point across in a way that's eloquent enough for your standards."
UCSantaBarbara,fox4lyu,t1_fox4inq,1588133943.0,Because it's not more than one cause? It's one cause under a bunch of different names just so you can seem like you have more support than you really do.
UCSantaBarbara,fox3lw8,t1_fox2zpx,1588133265.0,"And all you wannabe revolutionaries really think having multiple ""alliances"" helps your cause? If anything it just proves how much of a half-baked, disorganized, and frankly idiotic shitshow your cause is."
UCSantaBarbara,fox2s2a,t1_fowzt8j,1588132707.0,How much you guys wanna bet this is one of OP's alts
UCSantaBarbara,fowjgzq,t1_fowguoj,1588120981.0,What do you gain from being judgmental toward someone using commonly used slang on reddit besides coming off smug?
music_survivor,fovh9ij,t3_g9eue9,1588101290.0,"Aw I love Submission, Iâ€™d take it over Hallelujah Money and any of the bonus tracks (and probably Strobelite or Charger tbh)."
AskReddit,fovgv0i,t1_fouct8w,1588101093.0,Found mine.
farsi,fosaksq,t3_g9a7yy,1588026989.0,"Age Ye Rooz by Faramarz Aslani is a great song with a lot of verbs in the subjunctive tense. It could be pretty useful for you to hear it used within the song's context. Bogzar ze Man by Aref is another gorgeous one, it's not on Spotify but you can find it on Youtube easily."
UCSantaBarbara,fom913y,t3_g879dq,1587881927.0,Godspeed
UCSantaBarbara,fodowtk,t3_g6q9ki,1587687366.0,"I'm not sure if she's still teaching it but Patel was such a good prof. If you have the option to take it with her, I'd highly recommend it."
music_survivor,fo9phpm,t3_g6ee3a,1587626677.0,Pleeeeease consider doing the survivor including the deluxe edition songs!
UCSantaBarbara,fo47xx9,t1_fo3nby1,1587499736.0,"Exactly, it's frustrating to not know anything about the structure."
UCSantaBarbara,fo2b45e,t3_g5aihi,1587455743.0,"I still need to watch from lecture 3 on, been trying to persuade myself to get it done. Art is cool but learning about art history in this format is so fucking tedious."
UCSantaBarbara,fmu06br,t3_fxfeyr,1586382144.0,Salty are we?
