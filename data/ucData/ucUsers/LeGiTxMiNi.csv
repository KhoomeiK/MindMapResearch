TheLastOfUs2,fpft16o,t3_gd6gl5,1588582414.0,I wonder how big this sub will be in June.
TheLastOfUs2,fpc80zi,t3_gcgx6o,1588490750.0,"Ultimately get the console that will be more fun for you. I’m getting a ps5, playstation has been fantastic this generation and one misstep with the TLOU2 will not change that no matter how bad it is. Both consoles will be extremely powerful, the differences probably will not be noticeable. Xbox seems like they are getting back on track so if you like them more then go for it."
TheLastOfUs2,fp77xab,t3_gbm7yb,1588365673.0,I think that you are right that gameplay and environments will be top notch. I think it’s just frustrating that such a well made game could be completely over shadowed by not just a poorly written story but one that destroys what many people loved about the first game.
TheLastOfUs2,fp52326,t3_gbbbda,1588313842.0,This is the truth. This game will probably be ground breaking in the gameplay and environment departments. It’s extremely depressing that all of that will go to waste if the story ends up being this bad. It’s actually kind of painful to think of what might have been had they gone in a different direction for the story. Obviously we don’t know everything but it’s terrible right now.
TheLastOfUs2,fp51aoi,t3_gbc70b,1588313152.0,That’s a good idea.
TheLastOfUs2,fp50yxp,t3_gbcmur,1588312871.0,"I feel the same way. At first I was bummed especially since I just played the first again recently and was really excited for the sequel but now I just get a kick out of the memes and people’s reactions. I have friends who have not been spoiled, and don’t want to be. I’m extremely excited to see their reaction when they play it or get spoiled eventually lol. Part of me is definitely disappointed though."
TheLastOfUs2,foyw9h3,t3_ga9y1v,1588180350.0,"Also to add to your point, I see a lot of people say how there are no heroes or villains in the last of us, everyone is in this moral gray area. Here’s the problem I have with this. We watch Joel and Ellie the whole game, we care about them, we sympathize with them, and more importantly we play as them! They in turn become our heroes. You can’t just switch that around or pretend like it never happened."
PS4,fox8yyn,t1_fox6gyx,1588137103.0,"Just watched it. I’m going to be honest, the way he talks makes it seem like the game will be very different to the way the leaks make it out to be. I don’t trust him."
PS4,fowi5i1,t1_fot4ruv,1588120240.0,"I’m in the same boat, but one of my friends hasn’t seen the spoilers and he expects me to get the game because I told him I would before I saw the leaks. Now I’m stuck in this weird position because I can’t tell him I don’t want to get the game because that would spoil that the story is bad lol."
uncharted,fnwdaiv,t1_fnvga9k,1587316189.0,"Ya the rain looks like a texture, as if this was painted or something."
PS5,fnptk5t,t1_fnpqu7l,1587151743.0,Only the best for such a masterpiece!
naughtydog,fn2dewm,t3_fyri1j,1586585177.0,"I actually think it would be really interesting to see Nathan Drake in the last of us, he would probably be a really different person. Joel in uncharted would just be Joel before everything went bad."
mw4,fn1vmyf,t3_fysxsn,1586571196.0,"I was using the AK-47 with no attachments on hardcore today and I got 85 kills (was playing headquarters) lol. It mostly one shots, if you put attachments to make it faster (ads) I imagine it would destroy."
ac_newhorizons,fn1gdet,t1_fn10ewb,1586561448.0,He elevates their debt...
ac_newhorizons,fmv5fb2,t1_fmv47ck,1586406560.0,That’s exactly what I thought of.
UCI,fmmx402,t3_fw6t6x,1586213751.0,That’s hilarious
PS4Dreams,fm6rlwb,t3_ftcf9x,1585801298.0,"That’s awesome, I’ve never seen anything like that."
