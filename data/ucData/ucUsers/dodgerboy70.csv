Riverside,fpmj03x,t1_fpmf7om,1588734126.0,"I'll concede the point to you that we are a consumer economy that thrives on people buying stuff and working but economist have never really seen anything like this before where unemployment is not necessarily caused by economic failure but in economic stoppage. Another aspect of this  failure comes in government that did not stop mortgage collection, rent freezes, debt payments, because it is asinine to stop Americans from working but continue to ask them to pay for things."
Riverside,fpmbb6o,t1_fpkx44y,1588729388.0,"The economic consequences are already here, economic recovery is dependent on functional and responsible government stimulus towards effected markets. It's not really dependent on how fast we reopen.

Riverside,fpm6e6j,t1_fplwhbe,1588726495.0,"I agree that we can't live our lives in shelter forever but I think  our government has failed us. Out of a population of 2 million people in Riverside county, only 56,000 have been tested. There hasn't been enough tests, tracing, or antibody's tests conducted to warrant a safe transition into ""normalcy"". I don't necessarily think this stems from cowardice or fear but more of caution and uncertainty. What if you were to get sick and not die yet you get into a car accident and cannot receive adequate medical attention because most medical workers are working a surging covid 19 ICU. Social distancing, masks, staying at home is like having a couple beers and saying it's ok to drive home cause you're only buzzed. It would be your decision to drive but it affects and endangers the people around you."
