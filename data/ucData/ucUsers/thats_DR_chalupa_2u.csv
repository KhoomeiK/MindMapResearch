If your advisor is like mine, who is supervising a dozen or so students, constantly rolling out grant proposals, and traveling out of the state seemingly every month -he's likely expecting you to be more proactive in steering the project.

GradSchool,fnp3ug8,t3_g32l4r,1587138738.0,"Having a healthy work-life balance should not in itself be construed as apathy, nor should having diverse interests. I've only been in one mid tier PhD program, and most of my cohort do not exude the kind of personality that had a discouraging discouraging effect on you. I'd hardly say any of us are apathetic, rather, moving along in a sustainable manner."
