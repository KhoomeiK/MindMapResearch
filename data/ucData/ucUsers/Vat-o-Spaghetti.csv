UCSD,fnwugpe,t1_fnwtx2a,1587325677.0,"Yea, most CS classes are structured to be just difficult enough to get a normal distribution of grades. Definitely recommend looking for poli Sci - I’m not super aware of what classes are being offered over summer session but I can tell you that the vast majority of poli Sci classes aren’t too difficult to get an A in if you just complete the work on time. As far as the subject matter, some classes will be more difficult (game theory, security, quasi-law classes) and some far easier ( -insert nation here- politics, classes on development politics, international political economy or trade politics, etc). If you list out some of the classes you’re looking at I can try to tell you if they’ll be difficult or not :)"
UCSD,fnwtc90,t3_g4cs0l,1587325047.0,"What’s your major? That pretty much determines what catalogue of classes you should be looking at, unless you’ve already finished your major requirements."
UCSD,fn3uvzi,t1_fn0dcnp,1586628377.0,"I think they wanted to avoid unnecessary panic or the chance that students could be targeted or harassed. Blanket notice is one thing, but I think that they didn’t go far enough specifically in notifying individuals that they may have come into contact with the individuals being quarantined, and they ABSOLUTELY should have alerted residents of the housing about to be used to house quarantined students in full about the situation, and what measures were taken to keep existing residents safe."
UCSD,fn3um1q,t1_fn0x7dp,1586628220.0,"They housed quarantined individuals in the same building, but not on the same floor as current residents, so I don’t think they lied - at least as far as I know. Nowhere in the article does it mention quarantined students placed on the same floor as current residents. Either way, they should have done more to communicate."
UCSD,fn06yo1,t3_fydo0c,1586536545.0,"While they should have notified other residents of what they were doing, I think people misunderstand what procedures are put in place to keep these quarantined students isolated. 
Knowing someone who was placed in quarantine there, they were placed in an empty apartment and given only a few minutes to pack things from their original housing and move to the isolated location. They aren’t allowed to come close to the entry to the apartment once they are inside, and aren’t even allowed to touch the windows! All of their necessities are brought to them (food and such) and they have no face to face interaction with ANYONE until they receive their test results, or even longer if they test positive.
The university, while not doing its due diligence in notifying residents, is taking every precaution possible to make sure these individuals pose no threat to the community or to fellow residents. Anything that portrays them as such is disingenuous."
JoeBiden,fmf7mbh,t1_fmf5534,1586021551.0,"I think the impact of the progressive wing of the party has had on the positions of the Democratic Party has already been profound. While Biden may be helping to raise up what the rose gang labels “moderates,” the truth is that some of these people (definitely not Klobuchar, but certainly Buttigieg) are far to the left of any successful democratic presidential candidate EVER. Regardless of an appearance to not be taking progressive ideas to heart, they know that in order to keep voters they have to balance the interests of progressives with those of the swing voters that actually get democrats elected nationwide, and this has resulted in a leftward shift of dem politics over the past several decades. 
If you ask me, the progressives who show willingness to get things done and who don’t try to purity test long time Democrats out of the party (conciliatory but principled progressives like Warren and AOC) will do just fine, and I fully expect them to be some of the leaders of this party in the future. I’d say there’s less of a chance for people like Rashida Tlaib or Bernie who tend to be a bit more “my way or the highway.”
I think he will raise the profile of any democrat who wants to work to get things done, whether they are progressive or not. Realistically, you’ll see the rise of some new moderate icons - icons which the party has been largely lacking in the Trump era, people who can change the national understanding of the Democratic Party to aid electability. Alternatively, you could also look at Biden raising the profile of moderates as a way to force compromise, helping lead the party to an eventual consensus around a relatively electable centre-left candidate who doesn’t piss off swing voters OR progressives."
