acturnips,fpeevoc,t3_gcma35,1588546184.0,I love the animal crossing community so so sooo much and it breaks my heart hearing about bad apples üòû I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. That is so frightening and I‚Äôve encountered a lot of disgusting people who tried taking advantage of me as a minor as well. I hope you never have to experience another creep again! Happy crossings ‚ù£Ô∏è
UCSantaBarbara,fp11inw,t1_fozx3qt,1588221925.0,"While I was walking with the lady to the church I saw some people come out of a bar and asked if they had the Uber app. This was like the fourth group I came across who had said no (like.. just download it pls?? I said I‚Äôd use my card) and I was literally sobbing. Right before I left some guy who was outside minding his business said ‚Äúhey, I already got you a Lyft, they‚Äôre on their way‚Äù and then I sat with him and made small talk for a bit. Well, tried. I was still blubbering the whole time."

UCSantaBarbara,fonl17l,t1_fonkgzc,1587921523.0,"I thought maybe I was just a miserable failure when i was feeling overwhelmed with this class, but I think overall most people agree that 134A has been a shit show in every aspect. I hope there‚Äôs some TA‚Äôs/ or other Econ faculty on here that can send the message that this class is being extremely harsh on students during a time of such instability. The Econ department in general has been so historically apathetic to its students.

Edit: so basically what I‚Äôm saying is that you‚Äôre not trash, the Econ department is and I‚Äôll say that with my whole chest"
