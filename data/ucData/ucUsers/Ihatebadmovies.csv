UCSD,fnrkg0d,t1_fnlqe3u,1587191800.0,I’m an aerospace engineering major at warren. The thing I like about being an engineer in warren is have way less GE requirements (especially if you have ap credit). If you like skipping classes and possibly graduating early (or just having a more manageable work load) consider going here!

He has decided to assign double the amount of math hw he gave out Additionally, my teachers have essentially doubled the amount of lectures by assigning prerecorded lectures and then using the actual lecture time for something else."
