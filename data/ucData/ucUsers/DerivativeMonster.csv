SouthBayLA,fos75i3,t3_g8tcws,1588025188.0,"Oh wow, I haven't been here in ages. I loved the udon place that used to be at the end until it closed! Then I moved to the westside a few years ago and I haven't been there much since."
UCSD,fohgvvh,t3_g74t2u,1587765791.0,"I had a wonderful time at UCSD and don't regret going. I had an active social life, got really in shape, partied a lot, had a great student job, learned a lot. Howevever, I really felt my area of study was lacking, and sometimes wish I had gone to a different school to study. I graduated and struggled for years to find a job in my field, while some of my friends went to a 'less prestigious' CSU with a similar degree and got awesome jobs almost right away because the way the program was structured."
UCSD,fohg8bj,t1_fogcz81,1587765450.0,"UCSD is fine. I worded it poorly, I should've said 'doge it by going to a UC'. Just avoid a private school that's giving you nothing, I can't speak in general for the CSUs."
GirlGamers,fodpdyo,t3_g6moqj,1587687600.0,Y'all should look into [Habitica!](https://habitica.com/) Definitely helped me a lot when I was really depressed.
UCSD,fodp76r,t3_g6vn8v,1587687497.0,"I graduated into the 2008 recession. If you can, doge it by going into grad school, preferably into a UC that will pay you / give you a stipend so you don't have to take out loans. Loans will not be worth it. Don't go to a private school that's offering you nothing. I can't speak for the CSUs. 

edit: clarity"
acturnips,fo963w8,t3_g6edtr,1587611410.0,I dm'ed you.
AmItheAsshole,fo14a2e,t3_g4tk89,1587425447.0,"NTA. It's essential medication. My room mate of four years was T1, I would've been horrified if she felt she couldn't keep her life saving meds in the fridge. I get asking to do injections alone  - personally I'm afraid of needles, but my room mate used an insulin pump and I made sure to never make her feel badly about it.   


Have you asked her parents what they think? Can you keep it in a paper bag or something 'so they can't see it'?"
femalefashionadvice,fo0t8ce,t1_fo0svzg,1587419323.0,"I've never used a dryer sheet and I'm not really sure what one does. I mean I literally don't have space to hang a full load, did you run wires all over your ceiling and walls to hang clothing or have a yard? Just curious about your setup!"
FrameByFrame,fo0skw7,t3_g4ny9x,1587418982.0,This is dope
femalefashionadvice,fo0s70x,t1_fnzph4t,1587418782.0,How do you not use the dryer? I am in a small apartment and there's no way I could hang everything to dry!
AskLosAngeles,fnxg6f8,t3_g4c623,1587337951.0,"Dang if you weren't looking to live alone I'd ask you to come check out my place - I'm moving in with my partner and I have a room mate in my place of four and a half years in Mar Vista. Love the place, great location, sad to leave it."
1200isplenty,fnq0k34,t1_fnp5rjs,1587155399.0,As someone who is not italian this also sent me into a panic.
findapath,fnnkpsr,t1_fnn9r6g,1587094660.0,"My major is weird and university specific but can be boiled down to human-computer interaction, like cog-sci but more design focused. I have no yachts."
1200isplenty,fnnkd37,t1_fnndkzd,1587094418.0,I was pretty mad at him. We're both trying to lose weight but decided to 'treat ourselves' and I made a ton of veggies to go with it but.... emotional eating won out on his end. So it goes.
1200isplenty,fnn3nmr,t3_g29rr1,1587083712.0,"Ugh, my partner and I got pizza a few days ago. I ate two slices and planned on eating the other two the next day and he ate the other six :("

Cooking,fnb2h4m,t1_fn8w9qf,1586808053.0,I'd imagine marinating them adds a lot of flavor in addition to that?
Cooking,fnayy0u,t3_g0o98n,1586806282.0,Was it his first time roasting steak in the oven? The first time I did it I definitely overcooked it. There's hope!
LosAngeles,fn4ewre,t3_fz7dig,1586639975.0,My old neighborhood was like that. I loved hearing the music at night. I miss it!
Cooking,fn1le60,t1_fmzpl45,1586564500.0,I just don't like the idea of cooking food in plastic.
Cooking,fn1jw61,t1_fmzvirc,1586563570.0,Can you elaborate more on this? I know you grate carrots into some kinds of sauce. Always looking to improve!
AskLosAngeles,fmxqg1l,t3_fy1hvb,1586469885.0,What are your motivations for moving to LA for college? Have you gotten into a school yet? Do you plan on a few years of CC to establish residency? When do you want to move here?
AskLosAngeles,fmxq2x5,t3_fxlh5f,1586469682.0,I'm in the middle of moving and it's stressing me out that they're gonna flag me :(
AnimalCrossing,fmn992h,t3_fu44cs,1586220904.0,Maybe a dumb question but how do you find Zipper again? I think I have all of the recipes and I think I crafted them all!
