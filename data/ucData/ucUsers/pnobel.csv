CS170's approach to the FFT assumes a fair amount of understanding of the DTFT taught in EE16B, and CS189 does have 16AB as pre-reqs.

The practice of putting off 16AB seems to be going out-of-style, especially as the department makes it increasingly difficult for people to get into the class after their first two years."

You've got a ton of time to build a strong portfolio that isn't dependent on your grades for this semester.

My research advisor told me I should take everything P/NP and that it wouldn't matter much as the rest of my portfolio and my previous grades will give them assurances that it was largely the impact of this semester that shaped my P/NP grades."

I personally found 113 w/ Lovejoy pretty easy (and still learned a ton to be clear) and would highly recommend it. My friends highly recommend Math 104 w/ Etorvic, but at least for me the material in 104 is harder then 113.

110 is also highly recommended as a first upper div by most of my math major friends. It's also the last math class which will be a large lecture similar to the lower divs, so one friend said take it early before you get spoiled. If you're really comfortable with proof-based lin alg, you might just want to Math H110.

Also, what conjecture is your username about?"

I also got a solid A+ in 16A, so I'm not the best for this advice, but I'll try my best.

> How did you prep for 16B?

I think the most important thing to understand going into 16B is linear algebra and diagonalization. Understanding the concept of change of basis and how that relates to Vector Spaces is all really important and probably the most key thing to come into 16B with. Sharpening your circuit skills is good, but there's actually much less nodal analysis.

I would strongly recommend going through Khan Academy and some Math 54 textbooks focused on linear algebra to try and strengthen and support your understanding. 

> Which professor did you take it with?

I took it with Maharbiz and Roychowdhury. Highly recommend both."
