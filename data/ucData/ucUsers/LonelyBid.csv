UCSantaBarbara,fpensd7,t3_gcyvek,1588551139.0,I’ve never had issues with the party school rep and it’s actually helped me network. the reputation definitely improving
UCSantaBarbara,fp19x5t,t3_gamau7,1588228698.0,You should be able to switch during your online orientation or be able to sign up for the courses needed to switch.
UCSantaBarbara,fozdw72,t3_gad7tb,1588189025.0,"No. I’ve seen people of all body types here. But like others said, people care more about their health than looks. Well the most I heard was the one time I was called short but like I can’t fight that because I’m tiny and I don’t care about it.

But I’ve never seen any body shaming here unless it’s been internalized and there’s workshops/mental health programs around campus that do address this."

UCSantaBarbara,fnxd6ve,t3_g4fe3d,1587336253.0,Hmm...I don’t know if they’ll kick you right away. My cousin didn’t meet the gpa requirement one year but she wasn’t immediately removed from the program (this was the old system). It wouldn’t hurt to email them though
UCSantaBarbara,fmixulg,t3_fvk0le,1586119095.0,Always chunk. Makes life easier. I used to rely on the rstudio website tutorials.
