UCI,fmpby95,t3_fwnbka,1586278111.0,"Its a joke when recalled senators (""Faith Chua, Ryan Pavey, Joshua Wolfe, Gabriel Zanipatin, Nicholas Ortiz, and Logan Taylor Knight"") support the constitution that makes it harder to be recalled in an election they are running. Its a joke when they use part of the new constitution that seems good at first as the main advertisement to hide the other parts that don't make sense like 3k students to recall senator who got voted by 1k students.

tldr: Recalled clowns attempt to make it harder to be recalled lmfao"
