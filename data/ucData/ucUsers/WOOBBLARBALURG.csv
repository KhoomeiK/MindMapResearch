PrequelMemes,fp72nw6,t1_fp6z4ej,1588362937.0,"Oops, yeah you're actually right. I forgot how much he was younger in TPM. However, I think I read that at the end of the Clone Wars, Episode 3, he was about 37-39. And since it's about 20 years until he trains Luke in Episode IV, that makes him late 50s , around 57, which isn't too far off from Alec Guinness's age during filming. He was 62 years old, only about 5 years difference from Obi Wan's estimated age, so I do think he looks about as old as he should be, if only a little worn down from being homeless and living in the desert sun."
ACNHTrade,fp4ctbl,t3_ga5smn,1588296317.0,Hi! Do you still have the bamboo-grove wall?
PrequelMemes,fp45vtr,t1_fp40g9o,1588292310.0,Not true. He's in his 40s when training Anakin in the Clone Wars and mid/late 50s when killing Maul and training Luke.
ac_newhorizons,fopsgxu,t1_fopj0ry,1587970661.0,Oh that's great to hear! I just got the game last week so I was worried I'd be missing out on making all these limited time recipes.
ac_newhorizons,fooql02,t1_fm0gmwe,1587944365.0,"Do you know if any seasonal DIY obtained will expire when the season ends? Like, on June 1st, will I also no longer be able to craft anything using young spring bamboo?"
AnimalCrossing,fom4npc,t3_fobrh4,1587878214.0,Great list! Are migratory locusts really available right now in April though? I can't find any info on where to find them
AnimalCrossing,fo5yf9v,t1_fo5lscy,1587539848.0,What's the benefit of not getting pushed back? I saw someone else dig holes when hitting rocks but didnt understand why
UCSantaBarbara,fo1uu2z,t3_g51m2k,1587442006.0,I wanna visit your island when you finish it!
Music,fnnyft1,t1_fnnwo5l,1587105708.0,"That's interesting, because I dont actually have any interest in stocks/ business beyond just learning about their current events. So I guess that's why it works for me, because I listen to the pod for a morning news update. And when compared to other news podcasts, they all feel too serious to start off the day with. Life is already serious enough. Snacks is peppy enough that I kinda forget how much the world sucks lol."
Music,fnnmt1h,t1_fnnfmyt,1587096118.0,"Same! I love their humor about it too lol. One of the recent episodes they mentioned that they were gonna cover Corona beer, being the only podcast out there talking about a corona that had nothing to do with the virus. They've got a great energy that's really helping things feel normal."
Music,fnnetfq,t1_fnlw38i,1587090724.0,"I guess everyone's not into Snacks right now, so I'll just to go against the grain here, I gotta say I enjoy the pod. It's the only news I can listen to anymore because of how optimistic they keep their stories. Even when the subjects they talk about are heavy or serious. It's refreshing compared to what's out there, so I respect it."
Music,fnnegc2,t1_fnm8g3t,1587090489.0,Snacks Daily? l've never got that impression. If anything the hosts are sometimes too pc. But I guess one of them is from NY so maybe that's the sense you're getting.
cringepics,fnm1nuj,t1_fnlqpvo,1587063529.0,"Yeah this isn't really cringe. It's supposed to be a low effort, kind of funny meme."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fnayp47,t1_fnaxlgm,1586806156.0,"Yeah that is bullshit. I'm just glad we have this work around! Thanks for all this info, it really helps. I'm gonna get it right now."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fnahtac,t1_fn95hvr,1586797754.0,"It's a complex system, but we do what we have to so we can get the best price lol. Just to clarify though, I don't need to make multiple accounts, but is there a benefit to having separate regional accounts versus just having my one account and switching regions?"
StarWarsBattlefront,fn9b2tz,t1_fn8q5nc,1586766010.0,"Wait, the update is going to include extra campaign missions?? I didnt even realize. I'm so excited!"
NintendoSwitchDeals,fn90xh8,t1_fn8z5ij,1586755857.0,"Got it! And were you able to switch your account back to its original country and still keep playing the game no problem? 

Also, I'm realizing, I'm a bit worried i'll lose my old saves.. do you know if having a different country's version would affect the existing, original saves because they were from the US version?

Thanks for the tip, I appreciate the help."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fn8nvjv,t1_fmz34cv,1586745943.0,"As of today, is it still possible to do this? I just lost my physical copy a few days ago and finally gave up searching for it today, only to find out I missed these deals lol"
diabetes,fn5neao,t1_fn3qf7o,1586669740.0,"Yeah, that's a great drop! Congrats and keep up the good work."
diabetes,fn3q5ag,t3_fz2sew,1586625746.0,"I know you said it's because of what you eat, but have you tried messing around with your basal? I feel like you could benefit from increasing it quite a bit if possible"
AskReddit,fn04xu7,t1_fn03fj4,1586535517.0,"Oh okay, interesting. I didn't think about that. How long do people have to stay in purgatory until proving themselves and ultimately going to hell or heaven?"
AskReddit,fn01cgk,t1_fmzyz4s,1586533636.0,"What about the billions of people born before Jesus, or born where his teachings never spread, i.e. all of North America before the 15th century. They didnt have their entire lives to contemplate God if they've never heard of him. How is that fair?"
pokemon,fmvgdjm,t1_fmvdc30,1586416037.0,"Cringe is subjective mate. Someone could find it cringe that you and I are arguing about the use of pupper on a Reddit thread dedicated to Pokemon. 

Life is harsh enough, dont make it harsher for yourself and others by criticizing something so lighthearted. Its not all that serious."
pokemon,fmpr08b,t1_fmpq497,1586285754.0,"Haha, man, that's sick. If kid me had the luck or patience to find a bagon, I'd beef that sucker out too."
pokemon,fmpponv,t1_fmp7b3b,1586285086.0,"Same! Blaziken with Sky Uppercut was unstoppable. Plus an Aggron with thunder, earthquake, ice beam, and surf. Those two were my entire Emerald team."
u_clayblood2,fmgpw54,t3_fv68s9,1586054724.0,This is fucking hilarious. I hope Luke's a good guy because I'm rooting for Aurora now.
