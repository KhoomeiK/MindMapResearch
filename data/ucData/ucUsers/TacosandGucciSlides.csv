UCSD,fphm1wk,t3_gd74pf,1588623662.0,"I would post this outside of Reddit too. Reddit is pretty biased just in the nature of the website. It is anonymous and does not require having existing friends to make it worthwhile. There is also a segment of the population who is perfectly happy with their friend groups and do not feel the need or desire to join an anonymous community like Reddit. They are fine with just their friend groups on FB, IG, etc. I am not saying everyone falls neatly into those two categories, but those categories can very easily skew results. People are also more likely to fill out surveys when they are unhappy vs being happy. So surveys are always difficult. 

Also, people are  going to feel more alone due to being physically disconnected from their social groups."

UCSD,fpaxekf,t1_fpalevc,1588457702.0,"So true. I don’t understand how my classes that cost $150-$180 had nicer rooms, less students and better professors."

UCSD,fp1sb94,t3_garycm,1588246304.0,I would choose a different major. I am Business Psych right now and having a psych degree isn't really worth much. It would've been wiser to do Econ or Management Science with a psych minor.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fozq3xg,t1_fozcw6s,1588194904.0,Phishing attempts are a lot less successful when your password only works on one website. People buy data leaks and run bots to test them on various websites.
UCSD,fozpuee,t1_fow4f4p,1588194771.0,I’m not attending regardless. Having a graduation ceremony is one of the most moronic things the school could possibly do. The 6 feet distancing applies to indoor distances. Diseases can travel further with the help of wind.
UCSD,foxkwo8,t1_fowjsta,1588147246.0,"35k tests every two weeks is a lot of money. This does not include professors, administration etc.  Once you factor in the labor to administer,  to analyze and interpret the data, it gets very expensive. They will also need to set up places to send people for 2+ weeks if they test positive and live in campus housing. This is just not feasible without a lot more money than students would be willing to pay."

Target,foen661,t1_foeljt7,1587708397.0,"Alright you are right. I’m sorry about that I looked into it and target does use a decentralized system for storing inventory. I feel bad for you guys dealing with a crappy inventory tracker and decentralized inventory. 

Target.com really did run out of Nintendo Switch Lites to order. Idk how to prove it to you. They have been sold out on Target’s website for the majority of last week and this week. They have some in stock again which is why I want to swap it for a different color."
Target,foela0q,t1_foel0fv,1587706819.0,"If it is shipped from a store, why is the mailing address for a target return center?

That is definitely a warehouse.

Target,foekdwr,t1_foej4wh,1587706099.0,So Target will let 100s of people buy a product they do not have in stock? I know the the in store tracker is way off. I know that after visiting Targets that said they had them in stock. I bought these through target.com which shipped them straight to my house. I don’t think they are updating the in stock counter for online orders hours after selling out of a product. There would be been people complaining anytime a limited stock item is sold online.
Target,foehyqo,t1_foeh83f,1587704251.0,"There was a minute gap or so between me placing my order and placing my friends. I have the target app with Apple Pay and a target account. So it was a quick process to order a second one. I texted my girlfriend asking if she wanted one, and she didn’t reply for 20-30 minutes. When I went back to the Target app, it was sold out. There is a very high chance of a Nintendo Switch Lite’s inventory draining to 0 quickly.  It is sold out on Target’s website constantly, and the order limit was 3 per person."
Target,foegigm,t1_foe3va8,1587703202.0,"I shouldn’t have to explain why I need to return it, but angusboompants is exactly why I wrote out part of my story."
Target,foegav2,t1_focpsfp,1587703054.0,Thank you. That narrowed it down to two.
Target,foeg72b,t1_foeccee,1587702981.0,"Calm down man. I bought one for myself. I was in a discord chat with some of my friends when it happened. I was excited and told them, because I’ve been looking for a while. One of my friends asked me to grab him one too since I had the page opened still. So I ordered one for him. I texted my girlfriend if she wanted me to grab one and they sold out before I could order her one. Then they had more in stock a couple days later, and I ordered her one. 

I shouldn’t have to explain my story to you. You should really find something else to do besides getting mad at scenarios you make up in your head."

Target,focmush,t1_focmiyp,1587673232.0,"I am going to take a wild guess it is actually the people who are hoarding necessities that are causing that problem. Not a person who wants to return 1 item. 

It’s brand new and from an online order. Online orders can be returned."
Target,focmr7b,t1_focmjqc,1587673197.0,The Switch is unopened. I meant when I start a return with Target. I'm not sure which receipt to choose.
UCSD,fobjufb,t1_fo9l6ln,1587660550.0,This is super helpful. You deserve to get into whatever program you're going for.

UCSD,fo2bpx9,t1_fo2awz1,1587456370.0,"I would learn some basic programming using languages utilized by bio labs at UCSD. I'm not sure which ones are common, but that is probably the best thing to learn. Any class that isn't required or recommended on assist for your major isn't going to help you out. You should join a club and get some leadership experience."
UCSD,fo2alxq,t1_fo28a64,1587455236.0,"Finish your IGETC for sure and every transferrable course if possible. It is better to have as few classes to take here as possible. This allows you to take fewer classes per quarter which is great for internship possibilities and general well being. It is nice to have extra time to explore SD and etc. 

&#x200B;

Revelle is probably the best college for Bio majors. If you finish your IGETC, I think you do not have to take any college GEs. Im not 100% sure though."
UCSD,fnynx43,t1_fnymdk2,1587369227.0,I misread. I thought people were just inconsiderately leaving their stuff there.
UCSD,fnyks96,t3_g4nm3l,1587366184.0,70 units is the cap that will transfer over. It does not hurt your application to have more than 70.
UCSD,fnygof1,t1_fnyfu7w,1587362538.0,"When I lived on campus, I would move someones stuff to a counter if they were not there in 15 minutes."
UCSD,fntsb9x,t1_fnnsng0,1587247723.0,"I'm not sure if they changed the process since I went, but it might worth exploring. There's a good chance you will need to be tested again though. They were very picky about testing when I went, and I didn't have the money to get tested. They recommend a very narrow network of doctors with a very high out of pocket or they are covered by ship. They are booked up for weeks in advanced so you might be approved and not get accommodations to week 8-9.

&#x200B;

I shit on them anytime they are brought up which might not be fair anymore. I think everyone should at least try to work with them. The difference in my academic performance from when I had accommodation vs now is night and day. If I had the money at the time I would've taken the test again and worked with them."
UCSD,fnlz806,t3_g2kbio,1587062313.0,They might have ran out of space. You should definitely check multiple times on Friday.
UCSD,fnlycsk,t3_g2in72,1587061880.0,"I took a course unit limit exception. This is not going well. im glad 5/1 is the day to drop without a w.

Get a browser lock and make a set schedule. Such as I will attend class from 11-12:30, I will take a break until 1, I will study for this class until 1:45.

Shout out to the complete shit show of OSD at UCSD. I attended numerous community colleges and UC Berkeley. Never have I ever experienced such rudeness, unnecessary hurdles and underfunding as the OSD here."

Also remember they have to accommodate international students who can’t be left scrambling to get here due to last minute change of plans. They need to get visas, find housing etc. They have to give students a pretty big heads up to accommodate everyone."

Did you check to see if your college's advising tried contacting you through VAC or email? It might've got caught in the spam filter."
