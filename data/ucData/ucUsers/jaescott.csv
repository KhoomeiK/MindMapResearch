SMC,fp08opa,t3_gaj1ef,1588204565.0,If you‚Äôre a hardworking student and you aren‚Äôt someone who really struggles with math a ton then you should be fine. Try to get the best professors (RMP / grade distributions).

SMC,fo7enjy,t3_g6589e,1587577041.0,"I took Math 15 with Maldague and I really liked him. He‚Äôs a UCLA grad student so he‚Äôs more new to teaching but he‚Äôs very smart. He uploaded the lecture notes (most of them) and doesn‚Äôt care about attendance, so some people like that. Two important things to know about his style... 

1. The exams were very difficult and scores averaged around 50-60% but would get curved drastically (sometimes people got over 120% after the curve). 

2. Do all the practice exams until you know it by heart, best way to succeed.

My friend enjoyed Pachas for math 13. I have heard Rodas name more than Soleymani but it‚Äôs not in a bad or good way, just seems to be a more popular professor? PS If you ever have the chance to take Herichi, I highly recommend him."

SantaMonicaCollege,fn3r42n,t3_fpy2ne,1586626286.0,"If you‚Äôre determined to go to a good UC, I would say give it your best shot. Research the top feeder schools for UCLA and UCB, which schools offer the most classes for your major, and choose school based on a plan. I chose SMC but it didn‚Äôt end up having any of the highly recommended classes for my major. Besides that though, SMC gave me great opportunities, and it‚Äôs close by to where I grew up too. I recommend becoming a Scholar at SMC if you go here, the TAG/TAP programs greatly improve your transfer odds. On top of that try to get a leadership role in a club, do an independent study with a professor, and have some side work like an impressive internship / job or at least community service. Maintain a good GPA, check in with your advisor frequently, and I think you will have a great chance at all UCs for any major.

Oh and make sure you have a plan right away to finish ALL required classes (assist dot org) for each specific UC you apply to. And I recommend you complete IGETC.

It should take 2 years, but if you are determined, you can get in the school of your dreams!"

cgrpMigraine,fn2fpgs,t1_fn27p1l,1586587389.0,So do you just get a prescription once and that's it? The refills last all year? Or did you doctor need to renew your script every month / couple months?
cgrpMigraine,fn2f3qt,t1_fn21txo,1586586803.0,"Thanks! That's really helpful and kind. Sorry, I didn't mean to come off weird or pretentious about my insurance being 'better' or anything; I honestly just don't know much about it. I am very very grateful to have insurance though, don't get me wrong! I have anthem blue cross, and my copay is usually about $5 for most medications so it seemed 'good' to me. It's the neurologist office visits that add up. Maybe I should find an in network doctor.

So, if I get a prescription for Emgality, for instance, is there a limit on refills? I was hoping each visit would last me 3-4 months before I had to return for a new script. That is how my gabapentin works, and I didn't know if CGRPs are the same."

I went to McGill ('Harvard' of Canada) after high school and it was hard and depressing and I dropped out. I went to rehab for depression. Maybe, if I went somewhere else I would've had a healthier experience. I don't know if I regret choosing McGill, but I am now at community college at 25 years old trying to transfer to a good UC. I chose prestige over happiness (I really liked UCSB), and it turned out to be a huge mistake. Think hard about if you can endure 4 years at MIT and if that would be worth the opportunities a degree from MIT can open up for you. If you got in, you got in for a reason and are smart enough to be there. But sometimes, there's more important things than rank and competition.
