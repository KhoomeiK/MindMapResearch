On average the first three phases (00-02) she has made 4.6 comments. Definitely need to do some digging but not at the top of my list.
hogwartswerewolvesA,fpm875k,t1_fpm5mqc,1588727549.0,"Yes, the flavor text roles CAN be assigned to multiple people. They don't necessarily have to coordinate their powers.

The majority of players will PROBABLY be a mass of nobodies, but not necessarily.

Folks were talking about neutral wincons after Phase 0 because a neutral died. There COULD be four or six neutral players but from the way those roles read I don't think it's likely.
> TheFork101 has disappeared from Cantaloupe Commune, they were a Neutral.

One of the reasons I really like the games HWW puts on is because we never have a full picture of this game. Hidden information is a REALLY FUN mechanic in games when I go into not expecting things to be perfectly balanced. Roles can change and things can happen that flip our ""worldviews"" on their heads.

As an example, I played in the Epidemic game in 2018 as a Chicagoan (town affiliation). We were told that if we get infected (die) then we go into quarantine.
>they can no longer win until they get cured.

We played with the expectation that being cured and coming back from the dead was a possibility so we were a bit more cavalier about dying. After many rounds occurred with nobody coming back we started to suspect something was off. It turned out that there was no cure and we were just dead!"

**Methodology:**
I'm basically using ctrl-f and subtracting the number of instances of a player's name WITH the ""u/"" from the total number of instances of their name. I'm matching the case so 'casual' mentions in conversation are less likely to come up and it only picks up the 'official' username spelling that reddit associates with your account.

The biggest benefit of this are speed compared to manually counting, which STINKS. Drawbacks of this system are mispellings of usernames on my end (I copy/paste from my spreadsheet to the search bar) and the counts are slightly higher for players where their name is mentioned in comments WITH the right spelling and capitalization but WITHOUT the ""u/"" tag.

Please let me know if you find errors or discrepancies.

That special role changed hands every round and only a couple people can be eliminated by the end of the game. 

It may be worth dropping $20 to explore how Tabletop Simulator works since they have a pretty good system to play virtually.

Maybe a floating video feed where each player sits."
DnD,fonkx0f,t1_fojmm1m,1587921458.0,"What about doing a combination of attack rolls, graduated success/failure, and then dexterity checks? Mini-golfing is more of a Dex skill than a Str skill since most people don't have a problem hitting the ball the full distance needed but the golf club can be considered a finesse weapon as there are obstacles that require strong and accurate hits on occasion. Unless the PC has proficiency in golfing, their proficiency mod wouldn't be added to their rolls. 

As an example: 

PART 1: The PC first makes an attack roll with the golf club on the ball. The AC is low (1-5) to almost guarantee they'll hit the ball. The DC of the next part of this check scales with the difficulty of the shot. 

Straightforward shot (DC 10) and the PC rolls a 15? Great! They exceed the DC and proceed to the next section!

Hard shot with a ramp or corner to go around? Set the DC high, like 25. Now instead of having to exceed 25 on one roll, the PC just has to hit the ball multiple times until their roll exceeds 25. Maybe they roll a 15, 6, and 12 (total of 33) to finally make it to the next section! This simulates people eventually getting the ball to the hole even if it takes them a while. 

PART 2: Now that the PC got the ball close to the hole, they need to sink it. Set another DC, such as 6, for them to roll with a d4. This simulates the shorter, more-precise shots they may take. For this PCs can add their Int or Dex mods to the roll and, similar to part 1, they add their rolls together to see how many shots it takes to sink the ball. 

Natural 20s obviously count as hole-in-ones. Each die roll counts as a swing so you can track scores that way. The ""par"" can be calculated by taking the averages of the d20 and d4 and comparing it to the DCs you set. 

Downsides to this system is it favors Dexterity-based characters. The only way I can think to balance this is to remove finesse from the golf club which would make the initial section favor Str and the second section favor Dex and Int. 

Thoughts?"
