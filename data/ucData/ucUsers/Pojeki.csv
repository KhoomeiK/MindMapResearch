GearsOfWar,fontx8s,t3_g8jahm,1587926390.0,"Don’t quote me on this, but I believe down is actually good. 44% is lower than 80%, which means you’re now in the 44th percentile. Which is better and closer to top 1%

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has responded. I understand the frustration now. I didn’t understand there was a glitch when I originally commented or did the ranking system make sense to me."

UCI,fnnjmxe,t1_fnnj9fr,1587093921.0,"Bro, I was gonna call him out too. He’s making himself seem like this great guy. I was in the audience the meeting where he voted for the audience to no longer speak and where he helped vote in all the money for engineering. Now he says he has to fund the clubs? Man, you can’t hide the weapon, I saw you literally shoot the student body (FBI agent, this is a metaphorical statement)."

AskReddit,fmkof5c,t1_fmkkhay,1586162306.0,"Best Case Scenario:
You didn’t specify what kind of dollar. The genie gives you 1 billion Taiwan Dollars, you now are the happy owner of 33 million instead of your expected 1 billion. 

Worst Case Scenario: 
You are stuck in a single moment in time that you can not move within think within or nothing. Since nothing in your life can change, you are out of luck and never moved past the moment you asked for this wish."
