SanJoseSharks,fmj7lap,t1_fmghozp,1586124650.0,"I think it's too early to say he's saved Jones' career, honestly. Jones has visibly improved and I really hope that the upward trend continues. I'm firmly in the Jones camp, and if he plays the way he has played in the games leading up to the season suspension (like his excellent game against Toronto), then we should be in good shape, but we only have about half a season to determine this. That said, I wouldn't be opposed to keeping Nabby around to keep the trend going the way it is. It's more Boughner that I'm concerned about. The team seems to like him, and he's been good for the young guys, but he doesn't exactly have a record of success at the NHL level. 

I honestly don't know enough about Ricci's coaching as to whether or not to keep him."
