Like y’all are really willing to ruin a mans life and tarnish your own reputation if you’re wrong just to put on dumb AS events and put it on your resume? the guy who was accused had a very professional, effective response back to them though, good for him. we been knew ivp is the most cancerous group on campus bro"
UCSantaBarbara,fokl32q,t3_g7lthc,1587844073.0,"I did this exact thing (by accident in high school before I knew I wanted to be an Econ major), and my pre-major GPA will be based only off of 1 and 10A, which I actually prefer, as Econ 2 here is rather hard compared to econ 1. Keep in mind you only have to get at minimum a B and a B- to get into the major. Also, I believe someone mentioned your grade is based off of math and such, it is not. It’s only your core Econ classes. I would say take Econ 2 cause it saves you a lot of time and effort in taking it here while getting a pretty much equal education in the subject. Good luck!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnmgg1i,t1_fnlwh2b,1587070975.0,"And the portion of the wages student workers are being paid is incredibly inadequate. Personally, I worked about 15-18 hours a week at my on campus job and I am getting only about ~$380 in compensation until my place of work opens again, which likely won’t be until fall quarter or beyond. Keep in mind one of my biweekly paychecks was around this amount and I have to pay for my own rent and tuition. I feel majorly screwed over by the university between this and not getting a refund."
