Preserve the infrastructure my ass--half of it is being torn from construction projects anyway. I really wish there was something we can do about this because it makes my blood boil üôÑ"

UCSD,fok86v2,t3_g7xbcw,1587837207.0,does he give partial points for wrong stereochemistry cuz if not then riiiip
UCSD,fngbteq,t1_fnfi8pv,1586927553.0,They just repeated to me what was in the mass email which says that it'll take 3-5 weeks for financial things to be processed üôÑ
UCSD,fmvv6vp,t3_fw6cr1,1586432036.0,"This might be a bit late, but here is what I do.
Instead of watching lectures every other day, I watch half a lecture per day because my attention span is too weak for a 1hr20min lecture.
I also keep a physical calendar in front of me on my desk at all times with deadlines filled in. I highlight each assignment/task I've completed, so seeing unhighlighted bits stress me out until I finish them hahah
I've found that comprehending assignments as I work on them saves me a tremendous amount of time otherwise spent cramming for quizzes. We'll see how this goes come midterms ü§ûüèº
Best of luck"
UCSD,fmvufjx,t3_fwxota,1586431282.0,"Same. I'm sure they're still just trying to sort everything out.
Nonetheless, I sent an email to make sure so if you want I'll let you know what they say."

I had no research lab experience before I inquired about a lab position. The only experience I had was an introductory biology lab course (BILD 4) hahah. My PI asked for my CV where I listed my academics and extracurriculars for what they're worth. Got interviewed by my mentor then PI before they accepted me as an undergrad volunteer researcher. 
Lab hours can vary with which lab you're in. I am very fortunate to be a part of a lab team that's extremely lenient regarding hours per week. Since I'm still in my second year taking a lot of classes and extracurriculars, I agreed to go in about 6 hours a week (3 hours/week during midterms or finals). 
Other labs might require you to go in at least 10-15 hours per week regardless of exams, in which case I wouldn't recommend starting until the summer between your second and third years--mainly because the first two years are extremely busy with weeder lower divs like organic chemistry and math (at least for me; I took 17-19 units each quarter for my first two years on top of other commitments). 
If you also get a position with lenient hours, feel free to start in your second year. I recommend spending the first year slowly acclimating to college life; maybe join a club or two. Regarding summer things, there is a fellowship that's geared towards undergraduate researchers. I don't recall the name, but I believe it gives 5k or something for students who find a lab to research in over summer. I believe about half of those who apply get it."
