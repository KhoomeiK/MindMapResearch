I had changed my tune before Stay in Place was ordered and left the Bay for a farm in Tejas. I harp on everyone here to be more germaphobic. 

I don't regret being wrong. If I regretted every stupid thing I said or did, I'd never get out of bed. Luckily, my being wrong about this doesn't actually affect anything."
