UCSD,fobbiy4,t3_g6m1ej,1587658134.0,"You did NOT fail yourself at all. You did just the opposite. You took care of yourself in order to stay on track in your other classes. Failing yourself would have been to ignore that voice in your head telling you this workload is too much right now, putting yourself through hell for the rest of the quarter, possibly failing all of your classes, being put on academic probation, and spending your remaining college years digging your GPA out of the gutter. You did the right thing. ðŸ¤—"
UCSD,fo4zrmq,t1_fo4tsny,1587514472.0,Congratulations!!!

UCSD,fo4zns9,t3_g5m1sd,1587514409.0,"I think they will wait as long as possible to decide in the hope that we can do as many on site classes as possible in fall. Nobody (students, faculty, staff, administration) likes this forced virtual school."
UCSD,fntms56,t3_g3fmg3,1587244795.0,"Depends on your professor. If it's not indicated in the assignment instructions or on the syllabus, check with the TA or professor."
UCSD,fntlrfy,t3_g3nkv4,1587244206.0,3 classes in summer session is equivalent to 6 classes per quarter during the regular school year. Could you handle that workload right now?
UCSD,fng56yu,t3_g1h8ja,1586922597.0,There's one available on Wednesdays at 6 pm with a student who already completed the course. https://aah.ucsd.edu/supplemental-instruction-study-group/study-group-schedule.html
UCSD,fndqx62,t1_fnd3ynk,1586875789.0,Agree. Every LMS I have ever used includes these analytics.
UCSD,fndqr7z,t3_g119bw,1586875698.0,"You have until the end of week 5 to drop the course without a W and week 7 with a W, so you may want to see if things get better for you over the next couple of weeks. Change is hard and it takes time to adjust to it. Do your best to force yourself into a routine. It will be difficult at first, but if you do it, studying will become easier. 

If you are truly only struggling with motivation, this may help (it's helped me): If you are waiting to feel motivated to do something you don't want to do, you are going to be waiting forever, No one ever feels motivated to do the shitty things [studying, exercise, housework, taxes, etc.] in life. I can't find the exact quote but I think it's from Mel Robbins. Check out her TED Talk on youTube if you need a kick in the butt to get moving!

However, if you are struggling with depression or low self-esteem, you need to seek out professional counseling. A motivational talk is NOT going to help. Call your healthcare provider or CAPS."
UCSD,fncojol,t3_g0whst,1586842281.0,There's a study group on Tuesdays at 1:30 on zoom. https://aah.ucsd.edu/supplemental-instruction-study-group/study-group-schedule.html
UCSD,fn3j3v4,t1_fn1pbxz,1586621767.0,"He's correct. 4 unit classes are supposed to equate 12 hours of class work (lectures, assignments. studying) per week.  If you're not getting that in other courses, those profs are the ones not following Academic Senate policy, not him."
UCSD,fn3hgdw,t3_fypjpx,1586620815.0,"The TA should be able to mute the student if he won't moderate himself. I suggest sending the TA an email asking him/her to do this. If the TA doesn't know how to use the mute function, they should email servicedesk@ucsd.edu to ask for directions."
UCSD,fn3gjbc,t3_fyvuh2,1586620284.0,"Some professors are not handling the switch to online very well. Most are concerned that their students won't learn what they need to without traditional in-class lectures so are assigning extra reading and videos to close any gaps. 

They've also heard students concerns about the stresses of being watched during proctored exams. Research shows that students are less likely to cheat on ""lower stakes"" assignments and quizzes, so faculty are using more of those in place of, or in addition to, proctored exams.

My best advice is to keep posting your concerns on Reddit and other social media. A lot of staff and admin are checking r/ucsd at night and reporting trending topics to a UCSD coronavirus task force. They can't tell faculty how to run their courses, but they can let professors know that students are finding the workload unmanageable and recommend they reduce the number of assignments."
UCSD,fn3e4i1,t3_fyytb8,1586618861.0,"Congratulations on graduating! What a milestone!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I don't know the answer, so I suggest asking your question on the VAC. The advisors should be given this info as soon as a decision about commencement is made.

My guess is at least some of these fees will not be refundable because they will be related to degree verification and paperwork. For example, at least 2 staff members need to independently go through your transcript to make sure all degree requirements have been met - for your major(s), minor(s), College g.e.s, as well as general UCSD requirements. I know at least one external vendor is involved in graduation paperwork. There nay be other costs I'm not aware of, but it can't hurt to ask."
UCSD,fn3cmwy,t1_fn24ltj,1586617950.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you. I know the stress has been really high for a lot of students. 

You can get a loaner laptop from UCSD if your computer isn't working well enough for your classes. Just fill out this form. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072VRK55D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 

Can you take your remaining classes P/NP to help ease your stress level? I know it's difficult, but try to cut yourself some slack. If you can't, please reach out to CAPS to discuss your concerns with them."
sandiego,fmgbnco,t1_fmfts28,1586045449.0,That's fine. A cop car drove by me today when I was out for a walk. I waved. He waved back and kept driving.
