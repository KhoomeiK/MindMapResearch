berkeley,foozm0i,t1_foo2qka,1587949842.0,"I fear you're right. Honestly I entered community college with a Berkely-or-bust mentality because I wanted a good job in the valley, but a lot of the stuff I've read here and heard from friends who transferred about the nature of Berkeley engineering is starting to change that.

I've always had a lot of stress over keeping the near perfect transfer GPA in order to be considered for EECS. Feels like the only way to get recognized for my ability is to throw away a bit of my humanity, take easy As instead of quality professors and drop my non-CS hobbies in favor of building a dozen projects. Which i guess is pretty effective grooming. If I transferred to an environment like you described I feel I'd definitely end up in a dark place like those people you know."
berkeley,fontw9n,t1_fonjpp6,1587926375.0,"Yeah, I like that the school has a big focus on raw ability. But it's a shame that it can inadvertently lead to toxicity."
berkeley,fonc0ri,t3_g8an1k,1587916560.0,Question from a prospective transfer: How is EECS riddled with guys like this with no communication skills? Don't they heavily factor in outgoing activities for admission? Or do they but it's just not that good of a metric...

privacy,flch1mg,t3_fnt0ok,1585030563.0,"I just saw an ad like that, searched the app on Reddit and only found this thread.

Now I'm just dying to know more. It is brand new but there's no mention anywhere about this app. I might download it later."
