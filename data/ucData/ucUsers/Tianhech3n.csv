The three you mentioned are all battle royales with inherent design flaws and developers who have, in the case of pubg and fortnite, trashed the game at some point or another. Also, both of those games are still very popular. In Asian countries, pubg has two times the playerbase at least. 

It's not really outliving, it's surviving. All of those games are still super popular, just not at their peaks."

The display's power consumption shouldn't be significantly more than the old one considering the small resolution change and similar brightness levels, not to mention optimization over the years of production and software changes."

If I joined the program, do I just sign up for any summer session classes available to freshman?"
berkeley,fojso97,t3_g7nbm8,1587828564.0,I've become my own worst enemy: a self-proclaimed movie critic. There's just so much shit I can't let slide anymore now that I have more time to see the same cliches over and over again.
explainlikeimfive,fojn9jb,t1_fojmyew,1587825154.0,"Okay perhaps radiative heating was not right, but it's still using electromagnetic waves to heat food. 

Regardless of if it's heating directly or not, the resonance is just an increase in kinetic energy no? Isn't that the same thing as increasing temperature (and therefore ""heating"")?"
explainlikeimfive,fojly65,t1_foj39yl,1587824278.0,Well hair dryers are kind of inefficient since they use energy in both heating and moving air. A lot of them use resistive heating which uses more energy than radiative heating since it's not a targeted heating (why resistive space heaters are technically efficient but costly to run compared to IR heaters). Microwaves just use radiative heating to blast everything.

mkbhd,fo5kar2,t1_fo4l1n9,1587527738.0,"Yes actually. Since the percentages are based on the voltage curve of the battery. Li-ion batteries (actually pretty much all chemical batteries) drop in voltage as they are depleted. I'd imagine this is NOT what happened here (especially since that difference is huge, and definitely too much to be from an improper calibration of the voltage curve)."

I know this changes based on the person, but where is this line drawn? Is it based on previous discussion with the other party? Or is it based on how familiar you are with them? A third option?"
paydaybuilds,fmzv5n6,t3_fyaql2,1586530186.0,"I prefer anarchist over armorer when I know I have to carry the team (low level teammates or they're just incompetent). Armor gets killed quick yes, but it regens all the time so every other shot is absorbed. With bullseye, you can make that even faster. 

You're right about fire, it's awful for specials. However it works very well with anarchist if you do choose to run that since you can stun basic enemies as well as trigger armor Regen. Usually I take a primary fire shotty and something very high damage for secondary like a grenade/rocket launcher. That's entirely my preference though. Some choose a HE judge secondary with a high DPS primary in order to kill shields/dozers. 


No strong feelings on the m308, it's a good rifle."
