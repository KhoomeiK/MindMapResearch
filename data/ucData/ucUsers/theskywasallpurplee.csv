UCSantaBarbara,fo8s7ys,t1_fo7cs7t,1587602754.0,"I will agree with you on most of your points although I do not for a second regret transferring to UCSB. My education (minus the sheer fuckery that is online school this quarter) has been incredible. And I LOVE SB. Yes it's potentially  harder to make friends, and you have to hit the ground running for extracurriculars because you are late in the game than freshmen. I didn't even really understand the honors process until it was too late so the learning curve is real. Was also dissuaded from certain majors but actually with good reason. The research difficulty is definitely a thing. But courted the shit out of professors and got into 2 labs and built a relationship with 2 incredible mentors so I'm lined up well for grad school. You just have to hustle, bottom line. But I think that's true of most transfers at schools."

I am a straight A student and I did not receive an A in this class despite valiant efforts. Maybe you will have a better experience than me, genuinely hope so and genuinely hope she gets fired, and I've never said that about a professor. Last day of class she said ""well I don't know about you but I'm so glad this is over"""
UCSantaBarbara,fo8p64v,t3_g66541,1587601009.0,"Past 106 student here. Horowitz is the absolute worst Professor I have ever had hands down. No curve, tricky questions, went to see her multiple times with concerns to no avail. Multiple students complained to no avail. Search other reddit threads for Horowitz horror stories. Best of luck to you."
