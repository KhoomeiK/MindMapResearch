No one dies from a virus. They die from the secondary effects of the virus. In this case, people are dying from respiratory failure, clots, renal failure, heart failure, and liver failure caused by COVID-19 infection. 

This is the first time this disease has been seen in humans. We have no immunity. Unless you’ve had the disease in the last four months and recovered, you are susceptible.

>Its more widespread than we thought (14% in NYC have antibodies

There is some concern that the antibodies are not currently effective at measuring previous infections, because some of the tests show they are not very sensitive or specific, and may have both large amounts of false positives and false negatives depending on the test.

&#x200B;

>\- Its not going away with the heat so its not going to be seasonal like the flu

The heat is not really what seems to cause the greatest decrease in infectivity, we believe it is the humidity. However, the virus seems to be slowing down, in part due to physical distancing measures, but also possibly because of changes in humidity. While there is no reason to think it will go away in the summer, the disease might decrease in incidence during it. The CDC is currently preparing for an increase in infections in the fall.

&#x200B;

>People seem to get reinfected

Citation needed. I have yet to see a case of suspected reinfection, although I have seen several cases where someone was infected, thought they were all better, but still tested positive. I have also seen several cases where someone was tested multiple times, tested positive, started to get better, then tested negative, and then tested positive again later (still with no further symptoms). The question is whether the negative test is a false negative in those cases, which we don't yet know. We simply don't have to data yet to say if reinfection is possible. The antibodies we are testing are also not perfect measures of immunity (for the same reason that we don't regularly measure antibodies for measles, for example, in your average vaccinated person).

&#x200B;

>Anti virals like Remdesivir are beginning to show some promise and along with anti inflammatories like Actemra it seems we may have a treatment regime which would mean very few deaths and few ICU admissions

Unfortunately, I'm not really seeing any of these treatments panning out significantly in the ICU. They may work to some extent, but the number needed to treat may be very high.

>We have to let it wash over the population and infect everyone. The vaccine is a wild goose chase. its not coming.

We have over a dozen vaccine trials currently in progress. Luckily we have bent the curve significantly and hospitals will be able to tolerate small reopening little by little in most areas of the country very soon.

Specifically, the Imperial College estimated up to 2.2 million US deaths if these suppression measures were not taken. The CDC measurement has us at over a million deaths within a year.

Physical distancing was one of the measures used in this report."

For example, this is a report I and many other international agencies utilized to decide whether physical distancing and shut down of nonessential businesses would be worth the associated harms. 

Here is a month by month projection of deaths without intervention from the CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/images/US-observed-and-forcasted-cum-covid-19-death.png As you can see, they were anticipating upwards of 300,000 deaths within a matter of 3 months. 

These numbers aren’t being made up. They are complicated projections. They aren’t perfect, but they have a lot of utility in helping us to understand the risks we take with opening up too quickly."
CoronavirusCA,fo4frlw,t1_fo4en1d,1587503616.0,"What makes you think that? You’re clearly not getting that idea from our public health officials, scientists, epidemiologists, or doctors. So what gave you that impression? A blog post? A news article?"
CoronavirusCA,fo44p9z,t1_fo42xdj,1587498152.0,"You are suggesting that we “grow up” by sacrificing millions of lives so you can stop being bored. The goal was to slow the spread pf the virus to prevent healthcare overload and deaths and allow for time to develop a vaccine. Yes, the goal IS to prevent spread to everyone. Getting everyone sick now will only mean many people die right now. It doesn’t even guarantee there will be no reinfection, because we have no immunity data."
CoronavirusCA,fo3wd1l,t1_fo3d0nf,1587494056.0,"If they saw the inside of the hospitals in person right now, I think they would apologize publicly. Unfortunately, due to HIPAA, that can’t happen."
CoronavirusCA,fo3vfd2,t1_fo3ekim,1587493603.0,"I am telling you right now that we would not normally be able to handle these extra cases. It is not overkill. We don’t need a crystal ball. We don’t need a parallel galaxy timeline for “what ifs”. What we have right now would not have been manageable in a normal setting.


I also need you to understand that you are advocating for many innocent people to die. I’m assuming this is because you are bored and want to leave your home, or because you are out of money. I’m assuming you wouldn’t normally advocate for the death of others to make your life easier. Either way, I hope in the future you vote for the exceedingly wealthy to have slightly less money so that the average person can safely and comfortably quarantine for as long as they need to in an emergency. Then we wouldn’t have to trade lives."
CoronavirusCA,fo3b4f7,t1_fo3an0q,1587483855.0,"What exactly do you mean about strain projections being off? If we hadn’t shut down, there is no way my system would have had the resources for the cases we actually have right now, let alone an increase in the cases we would have seen if we hadn’t shut down, plus the regular cases we usually see (postsurgical cases, auto accidents, etc.) that aren’t in the hospital system right now."
CoronavirusCA,fo2vlsu,t1_fo26by8,1587475156.0,"What on earth are you talking about? The number of asymptomatic or low symptom people have nothing to do with the strain on the healthcare system from this disease. Right now, with the shutdown, my county hospital has 50% of its totaI ICU beds taken by COVID-19 patients. Normally we would have those beds filled with car accident victims, workplace injuries, gunshot wounds, etc. Because of the shutdown, we are able to accommodate it. If we hadn’t shut down, we would already have been overrun weeks ago."

CoronavirusCA,fnwaiyk,t1_fnw7smg,1587314662.0,It's mostly a function of population density. More SNF residents= more staff exposed. Many staff do shifts in multiple facilities. More exposure = more infections elsewhere.
