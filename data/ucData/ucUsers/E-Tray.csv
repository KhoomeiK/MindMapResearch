COMSOL,fpfe89e,t3_gd5cyw,1588568674.0,"Hey there COMSOL community :)

I'm super new to COMSOL and new to the physics I'm working with so with that comes a lot of unknowns. I am trying to heat up this tissue at the focal point with ultrasound coming from a piezoelectric material. For the most part, I'm mimicking the sample that is provided by COMSOL but is not seeing the same results.

Possible problem: I haven't set up the physics correctly and the Biotheat is not partially dependent on the Pressure Acoustics

It would be extra helpful if someone can assist me in setting up and understanding the modules more one-on-one(able to compensate).

Thank you in advance!"

TooAfraidToAsk,fp7rhc4,t1_fp598hy,1588376276.0,I’m legitimately curious here. What do you mean by this? Or do you have an example?
TooAfraidToAsk,fp7r5yo,t3_gazx4k,1588376091.0,"Think about tribes of people in remote places. Most of them have their own religion or belief of a greater power. Many may sincerely have that belief and it isn’t to control anyone. 

As for large religious groups it’s not the concept of “God is watching you” but more like “Here are the true and good morals. Follow them to fulfill your purpose but if you don’t, realize your mistakes and ask the God who made those morals to forgive you for breaking them”
Differences come down to what those morals are, who the “God” is, and sub-beliefs within it. 

Speaking about Christianity here: many churches become legalistic and and start to impose the Big Brother aspect more than they should. Although people should be held accountable for their actions it is not intended to make someone worried about doing wrong, but to encourage them to do what is right or good.

TooAfraidToAsk,fo3r555,t3_g5e0a9,1587491595.0,"No. As a person, I don’t like him, but as a president I’ll vote for him because of his more republican views. Yes his tweets are sometimes bad but I’d rather have a president that actually does something and has the charisma and confidence to take charge rather than one who feels nice but does nothing. 
Overall I’d say I like Trump. It’s hard to hold that idea when I haven’t heard a single positive headline from a non-conservative news source or Reddit. 
Keep this in mind: conservatives tend to be conservative people (less vocal with their opinions on social media) 
Liberals tend to be more liberal people (posting on Reddit, very active, and vocal with opinions) 
I think this is why it seems like no one is on trumps side when in fact many of the prediction polls were always around 50/50"

AskReddit,fnurl6h,t3_g3yyu7,1587269258.0,"Really amazing. My parents put rules down in the house just like normal parents but religion helped me discern right and wrong for my own. Now off at college with all the freedom in the world I know what’s good for me, good for my friends, and good for my community. Church and religion has really made me have a optimal life. Rather than feeling guilty for doing something wrong, it’s more of like a personal obligation to do something right. 

It’s sad to see many of the comments about people who have gone away from religion because of their parents. This is one reason I love my parents even more for raising me right because I am happy with my life and I’m happy where I am."
