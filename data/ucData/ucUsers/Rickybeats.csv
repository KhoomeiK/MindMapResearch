PS5,fpmk1nt,t3_ge95a1,1588734792.0,I'm on my 5th watch-through. How about you guys?
apexlegends,fplxr40,t1_fpl7gph,1588721514.0,Hmm. I was taking a guess. I run Gravity star mostly.
apexlegends,fpkwxmo,t3_ge23lb,1588702462.0,Satchel from titanfall?
PS5,fpipy0v,t3_gdp957,1588646128.0,"""Keep your expectations low, and you will never be dissapointed.""

PS5,fphmoe4,t3_gdhmf2,1588623982.0,Kingdom Come Deliverance
penspinning,fphfudw,t3_gdfpdj,1588620538.0,Isn't there direction change in this combo?
ghostoftsushima,fpe0ag2,t1_fpe007z,1588537798.0,"In all seriousness, many games don't have a hard waypoint system. Don't underestimate level designers. They are good at suggesting pathways but still allowing freedom of movement. Dark souls and bloodborne come to mind as examples."
ghostoftsushima,fpe007z,t3_gcu560,1588537637.0,Anyone complaining just needs to git gud.
apexlegends,fpc8iqh,t1_fpaujlh,1588491255.0,She def looks like a soul snatcher
XboxSeriesX,fpbeh8j,t3_gcgxjo,1588468143.0,"For sake of accuracy, PS5 is confirmed to support 120 FPS and does support ray tracing."
PS5,fp586x8,t3_gb97no,1588319696.0,"It definitely looked great. However, Ubisoft does an amazing job with their cinematic trailers. The game won't look like that but I'm sure it will look pretty good."
PS5,fp57y0i,t1_fp4m2rj,1588319448.0,This had me busting up for some reason lol
PS5,fp57uml,t3_gbdh37,1588319353.0,*busts out the music sheets*
PS5,fp4wwez,t1_fp4w3vi,1588309545.0,"Interesting point. I'd say there isn't much ground for either game to claim confidently, IMO. We shall see (hopefully soon)."
PS5,fp4uiw3,t1_fp4p8qg,1588307738.0,"Isn't it all just speculation due to the cryptic tweets that bluepoint posted? If I remember correctly, the tweets had a lot of suggestive language to point towards different games, including Demon Souls and LOD."
PS5,fp04rmp,t3_gafqlq,1588202470.0,I definitely expect 60 FPS gaming to be more common next gen given the massive improvements in GPU and CPU power.
PS5,fozjiqi,t3_ga5g7p,1588191716.0,"This is a good render, but, if I'm being honest, the all black renditions seem kind of bland."
PS5,fovd13g,t1_fov7hvk,1588099273.0,I think it's just my network environment. Lots of walls and lots of people connected to Wi-Fi at my house.
PS5,fov1ejc,t1_fotsopt,1588093816.0,That's interesting. My speed gets doubled with Ethernet.
PS5,fotq2my,t1_fotmgka,1588062090.0,I recommend using it. Once I went wired I never looked back.
PS5,fom365e,t3_g824uj,1587877040.0,Mountain Dew.
PS5,foh70ou,t3_g7g53n,1587761237.0,Saving my money for PS6 Pro. Walmart is taking pre-orders already.
PS5,foh6gia,t3_g6ypy9,1587761062.0,Any of these (except The Order) would make me want to buy day 1.
PS5,foh676y,t3_g7fmuk,1587760983.0,Got excited then I saw what the website was and then I saw where they got their info from. The article also says PS5 is scheduled to release sometime next year...wtf?
PS4,foh4598,t3_g6senc,1587760323.0,Thanks
xboxone,foh3rx6,t3_g7bhd3,1587760200.0,Hope everyone is safe and gaming!
PS4,foh3kio,t3_g78r2x,1587760134.0,Even though times are tough...backlogs will finally be tackled.
XboxSeriesX,foh15zi,t1_fog9xi6,1587759341.0,"You are right. This gen, in terms of the enhanced consoles, the differences were no where near ""staggering"". Most of the difference was pointed out in 400x zoom by digital foundry."
PS5,foehjmx,t3_g71366,1587703941.0,Take everything he says with a HUGE grain of salt. Tidux too.

apexlegends,fo9ui5s,t3_g6ac8u,1587631629.0,Oh my god lol
cyberpunkgame,fo820bq,t3_g65664,1587588493.0,I'm gonna be playing witcher 3 nonstop until release. Already on 3rd playthrough as of now. It's the only game I own but still...
ucr,fo5rdp6,t3_g5mmvt,1587533332.0,Victor Moreira was my advisor for a bit and he was amazing. The he got moved to CHASS advising and all my advisors after him were so trash.
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fo55ui4,t3_g5jmkb,1587518161.0,Who is Klobrille and why should I take their word ?
apexlegends,fnxjsre,t1_fnxf4x8,1587340112.0,"""Or really any game sense"" Jesus lol"
PS5,fnv72bb,t3_g41mme,1587282476.0,But why?
PS5,fnv6xd1,t3_g42yny,1587282339.0,"You're starved for information and you're hooked on an already debunked rumor (more like fan fiction) regarding heating and redesigns. While Sony's marketing campaign for PS5 has been kind of trash, you cannot deny that the reveals they have done have made people hyped as hell i.e. most liked gaming post with logo reveal, dualsense reveal garnered hundreds of thousands of likes/retweets/etc and had everyone talking. Just chill. We will have information soon enough."
PS5,fntkm4y,t3_g2rukb,1587243547.0,"Never understood why people think only Sony is being affected by COVID. And Redesign ? If you're referencing that fan fiction that was circulating a while ago, it has been debunked."
PS5,fntixvv,t3_g2w647,1587242587.0,"What the hell even is that video? That camera placement is so terrible, it's even clipping through the walls. Try looking at the Divison 2, 30Fps vs 60fps. I've rarely had an experience where 30fps is better than 60fps (and I'm a lifelong console gamer) the recent star wars (fallen order) game is a good example. I played it on PS4 Pro and while the performance of that game was awful, there were moments where the frame rate would be high and stable...it looked and played so much better. Smoother, more responsive, and more exciting."
PS5,fntht0c,t3_g38qpi,1587241933.0,Watch Cerny's talk. He explains clearly how the BC in PS5 is different from the PS3.
PS5,fnri72q,t3_g3bjac,1587189719.0,Lol were you around for PS4 launch?
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fnmb6vy,t3_g2iyd9,1587068289.0,Very soon
PS5,fngudhl,t1_fnapjoi,1586945302.0,"My god, thank you! There's so much misinfo going around (especially about that last part) and this post clears it up nicely."
XboxSeriesX,fngtnuk,t3_g1hatg,1586944542.0,What? Sony has been getting shit on all year because of their terrible marketing campaign. I.E. everyone mocked the Cerny talk and so many people have been voicing their concerns about the controller.
Tekken,fngsu52,t3_g1lnr9,1586943666.0,"This will fall on deaf ears in this sub, unfortunately. Defending paid frame data is mind blowing but it was done."
PS5,fn5l139,t3_fz51hl,1586667765.0,"Honestly, the next God of War alone is enough to get me on PS5."
PS5,fn1wqqd,t1_fn1v1lg,1586571964.0,"Honestly, this^ 
Have silver, man."
PS5,fn0vrfp,t3_fydc79,1586549695.0,Garden tools mad
PS5,fn0ul61,t1_fmziugx,1586549034.0,They are right.
PS5,fn0tdin,t1_fn0rcx4,1586548370.0,Hmm..we shall see.
PS5,fmrs384,t3_fx1i2p,1586333434.0,Lol what? It's so useful for in-game screenshots or clips. It's one of my most used features on the controller!
PS5,fmrctzu,t1_fmrc2rr,1586319586.0,"We haven't seen anything else from Sony though. MS has taken the time to show a lot off already, while Sony hasn't even shown off the console yet. The two companies have completely different strategies for revealing next gen. So I'd say it's not fair to do a comparison and think Sony is ""Failing""."
PS5,fmrbzco,t1_fmr48sc,1586318937.0,That's a bit of an overstatement.
PS5,fmr2ou4,t1_fmr14vw,1586312481.0,Don't get your hopes up.
PS5,fmqfvtm,t3_fwty9g,1586298827.0,Probs not. That would drive up the price a bit.
PS4,fmmatve,t3_fw1kha,1586201952.0,Thanks!
PS4,fmkad0t,t3_fvqo0m,1586148762.0,Thanks!
