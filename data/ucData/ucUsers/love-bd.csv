ucla,fn2lp5l,t1_fn1xne2,1586593689.0,U shouldnâ€™t pay for the bill. The subletter should pay all of it. Everything else is the risk and uncertainty u signed up for when u decided to live in a double.

ucla,fmyytnf,t3_fy3crj,1586500163.0,"Definitely go to UCI. Ur own work(projects, research, papers...) is so much more important. And u donâ€™t have to stress about the tuition. Especially during hard time like this, u donâ€™t want to worry about money"

ucla,fmpbzwu,t3_fwnqh7,1586278135.0,I donâ€™t think writing class in summer is a good idea. I did that once and had a paper due every week.
