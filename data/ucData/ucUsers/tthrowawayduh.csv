berkeley,fpn1ez6,t1_fpmx8yx,1588747340.0,"Actually I don’t stand by it anymore, since the University gave out the CARES award this morning, which covers the campus fee if you would’ve had trouble paying it. Berkeley recognizes that in a pandemic, some students are having trouble paying off “their debt”, and they have a solution. So I’m satisfied. 

My problem with the campus fee was that it might be the last straw that prevents low income students from continuing school because our economy is basically trash right now. We can’t just act like everyone is still financially able to pay for all kinds of fees. They might’ve committed to Berkeley thinking they have enough money without expecting a covid pandemic coming. One of the things the campus can do is to lower tuition so students stay enrolled. Where can the tuition cut happen? Obviously not letting the faculty take the pay cut. Not the facilities staff either because if I remember correctly Berkeley has a contract where they can’t lay off people or something. So the only place it can happen is if Berkeley goes into its emergency fund to pay for its debt instead of forcing everyone to pay a blanket fee, regardless or how youre impacted by the current situation. They’re still enforcing no tuition reduction, but I believe the CARES award really helps the student retention rate so hey, I don’t mind if we have to pay the campus fee (since it’s covered by the award if you would’ve had trouble paying it)"

berkeley,fplo4nc,t3_ge0yo0,1588716266.0,"I took 134 with Lucas and CS 70 with Song.

Lucas’ lectures....have the special ability to put you to sleep, lol. Maybe it’s just me, but he talks really slowly and to me its like a “so many words to say so little” vibe. If you take 134, MAKE SURE YOU SIGN UP FOR THE ADJUNCT WITH MIKE, that’s how my grade got saved.

Song is a good lecturer in my opinion. One of my friends said song is confusing but I thought he was just fine. Not amazing but still good. Although I took 70 with 134 under my belt so maybe I’m biased."

berkeley,fpjedrv,t1_fpjdc5w,1588665447.0,">	all tuition

We’re still paying tuition, it’s just the lower sproul fee I’m talking about here. And yes, Berkeley should’ve had some sort of emergency fund in my opinion. Having back up money is basic financial advice applicable to almost everyone. 

>	If you want to “get out of your contract” with Berkeley, you can withdraw for a semester.

Fair point. However, does Berkeley realize that if a lot of students do this, then they might end up losing more money than not charging the campus fee to begin with?"
berkeley,fpj339c,t1_fpin5wr,1588655234.0,">	the debt payments have nothing to do with usage

And the debt is the school’s not the students. I get your argument, but the school should’ve looked at it’s budget before taking out a loan they have no way of paying off unless they continue to milk their students in a pandemic.

>	everything to do with COVID

Yeah, maybe in a turbulent time like this the school would at least make it easier for students financially but no we have to pay off their debt instead."

Why I’m so concerned about this? Because it’s dumb to help them pay off their loans towards a service nobody is going to use. Also, shouldn’t they have an emergency fund or something similar for this?"
