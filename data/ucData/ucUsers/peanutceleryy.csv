SDSU,fp7hcay,t3_g9qo9h,1588370633.0,"The college of science makes it clear on orientation that if you cannot graduate within two years, they are not going to let someone change majors. So if you can graduate within two years then most likely. I will try to take summer classes right now at SDSU."
Disneyland,fp4hehd,t3_gaxr5d,1588299105.0,I thought it was overrated.
SDSU,foshi7i,t1_fos594z,1588030813.0,"Yes computer engineer is most useful in San Diego with Qualcomm, defense industry, and some biotech companies"
SDSU,fosh4le,t3_g9aa1e,1588030601.0,Is it for the GWAR?
SDSU,fopms9h,t3_g8u17g,1587965755.0, Computer engineer program is in the engineering college which I heard is better than the science college.
espresso,fop4q2a,t3_g8mf7p,1587953035.0,How is the major Dickson supposed to taste like? I’ve tried to dial it but I can never get a taste that I like.

espresso,fo7oswa,t1_fo4xshy,1587581971.0,Yup. It’s a great starter machine. Will show you if you like the hassle of pulling a shot with the modifications done. I’m looking to upgrade soon.
SDSU,fo5hezh,t3_g545zz,1587525706.0,"At SFSU they have A,B,C and NC which I think is way better"
SDSU,fo5gnsy,t1_fo3v1np,1587525191.0,"Just take ones with no essays needed and that they’re online like AMIND 440 ,WMNSTD 325, also SDSU tuition is not based on credits like community college. SDSU’s tuition only has two tiers of tuition payment: full time tuition (12 units and above) and part time tuition(less than 12 units). You pay the same in full time no matter if 12 units or 19."
SDSU,fo3pupg,t3_g5hcxp,1587490983.0,No. All GE explorations are upper division courses. You may take it online at another CSU if you get approved from an advisor.
SDSU,fo1fmu0,t3_g53ik7,1587432248.0,Damn how long ago was that?
