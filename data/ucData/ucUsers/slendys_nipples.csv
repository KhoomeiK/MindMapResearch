UCSD,fopueex,t3_g8t59o,1587972460.0,6B is regarded as the worst gen chem class in terms of difficulty. I would just say do as many calculation and word problems from the book and review the Sapling questions so that you know how all the information relates to one another.
UCSD,fopu8iq,t3_g8q16g,1587972305.0,"yeah I dropped his class after week 2 because the amount of work required was such BS. It should be illegal to have students have to watch multiple 30-50 minute videos a week while also having to attend his less-useful ""pickup"" lectures 3 times a week. Don't have both... have one or the either. And 4 quizzes per week? One of which is weighted essentially like a midterm? AND a bs writing assignment once a week... for physics? And homework all on top of that... Burgasser was out of his mind structuring the course like this.

I really didn't want to drop the class either because I had heard such great things about this professor and thought I would be doing myself a disservice by losing an opportunity to learn from him. But nah, seeing this post reaffirms my decision. This man has gone dark knight dummo. Maybe someone can send this post to his twitter?"
UCSD,fo78znt,t1_fo630kp,1587574300.0,"the email the professor sent us started with them thanking the person for coming forward.

then prof immediately proceeded to say they got a zero on the assignment and was reported to academic integrity.

UCSD,fo61nwa,t1_fo60ka8,1587543172.0,"basically,

there was a homework assignment from BILD 3 that someone posted on Chegg. The professor found out, got butthurt, and announced via email that it was reported to academic integrity, and the person came forward shortly after and, for a lack of better words, got destroyed.

Now the professor is warning that Chegg is going to send a report of anyone who contributed/***VIEWED*** the answers, and anyone caught is also going to get destroyed. I ask of r/UCSD, is that even possible?"

UCSD,fnvapfa,t3_g3ygxw,1587286225.0,"something to think about. You may want to switch majors later on, and majors like chemistry, data science, mathematics, any sort of engineering/physical science major will likely need you to take the 20 series. I started out as a pharm chem major so I did the 20 series. It hurt my GPA because it was my first time taking any form of calculus, which sucks because I ended up wanting to switch to a major that only needed the 10 series. So if you think you'll only need the 10 series because you don't anticipate wanting to switch to an engineering major EVER, definitely go for the 10 series. But if the opposite is true, you should take the 20 series as it will open up any engineering/physical science majors to you."
UCSD,fnk86x5,t1_fnk7r6b,1587017946.0,thank you for this! i was talking initially about my overall GPA but I think my GPA for the prerequisites is much higher :)

UCSD,fll8r4o,t3_fp48l3,1585255707.0,"just finished 20C, I'm not sure how different 10C would be in terms of class content but I would recommend you to look over your derivative and integral rules like craaaazy"
