UCSantaBarbara,fplfu6n,t1_fpleqo5,1588711950.0,I don’t know anymore! I see them ticketing a lot lately!
UCSantaBarbara,fpl4jqy,t1_fpl3wbp,1588706240.0,"At first I thought these people are smart. But then I saw that one car with three tickets, and each ticket was 88 dollars. Hard pass.

So for him, was it really cheaper??"
UCSantaBarbara,fpgwtpu,t1_fpfu1ow,1588610928.0,"I saw this, but this post was 5 years ago. I thought maybe they would upgrade by now, with technology changing and classes going online :/ I’ll send them an email."
UCSantaBarbara,fpgwpgb,t1_fpfzq1c,1588610868.0,I will. thanks for the suggestion.
UCSantaBarbara,fpdl6au,t3_gcjipf,1588529159.0,"Yoooooo!!!! I had them!! My housemates didn’t believe me when I told them it was spicy, because they said nothing from portola is ever spicy. So I gave one of the enchiladas to someone, and by nightfall I saw him throw them away. Shit was spicy."
UCSantaBarbara,fp8mgxa,t3_gbzbku,1588396289.0,"Totally doable. I took summer school from 8-11 am, and emt course 1-11pm every weekday. Did this for a month, was pretty draining but the emt course is so cool it makes it worth it. Learned a lot about how far I could push myself (was pretty lazy before doing this). It’s not easy but the emt course teaches you such cool material."
UCSantaBarbara,fozl4a8,t3_ga5m14,1588192475.0,"Just got off the phone with the BARC. They said the money will be sent tonight or tomorrow, and will be received in bank accounts 2-3 days after that."
UCSantaBarbara,fozkvq4,t3_g9zkza,1588192362.0,"Haha. I personally get confused by it. It’ll show me almost full bars, but internet will feel really slow, especially around chipotle and target area. It’s alright, not amazing. Works better than where I’m from though. Wouldn’t say it’s the GOAT."
UCSantaBarbara,folbmw3,t1_folbium,1587858803.0,That I will 100% agree with you on. Hard to get help and TAs are unresponsive/unhelpful sometimes.
UCSantaBarbara,folbar4,t1_folay91,1587858606.0,"Okay low key still hard. But I would say better because the labs take 15 minutes instead of 4 hours, and not graded on purity."
UCSantaBarbara,fmjmdsu,t1_fmjbg5y,1586133240.0,Thank you :) I think I will do 8 just to stay above the 6 credit limit for financial aid. Sad it probably won’t be on campus but I understand.
