AskMen,fph9975,t3_gd7lzi,1588617201.0,"So one time, I went to an interactive play with some friends, there was a main character that started talking to me during the show, and I completely lost the ability to speak. This girl was the prettiest woman I had ever seen in my life, I am talking complete love at first sight kinda shit. She asked me a couple of questions and I could only do hand signals, no sound would come out of my mouth. Eventually, a question she asked was yes or no, and I gave her a thumbs up and to this day I am forever mortified that I could not talk to the girl on stage."
raisedbynarcissists,fph1gf6,t3_gd46w7,1588613283.0,"Oh my god are you me? Because I also was not allowed to wipe myself until I was 11, and I couldn't shower by myself until I turned 14. I had no privacy at all in the house, changing or using the restroom. Although, this was how my sister and I were treated.

When I talked to my therapist about it, she said it's sexual abuse, so take that as you will.

I'm so sorry you had to go through this, I know how hard it can be to grapple with. Stay strong, and feel free to DM me if you need to talk."
AmItheAsshole,fp69ici,t1_fp5lw5v,1588348488.0,"This guy sounds exactly the kind of guy I had to deal with in highschool. Except I was the girl he decided to harass. He always made comments about how he was gonna shoot everyone in the school but me, and how he was gonna be a drink and smoke his life away when he gets older. I was always polite to this kid, cuz ya know I'm nott gonna be a dick to the guy with a disability, and he took that as advances I guess. Every time we were in class he would sit next to me and throw a fit when he didn't, and continued the fit until he got his way. Every day he would hug me, I said no each time and he kept hugging even after I asked to let go multiple times. This was a clear ""B I need you to let go of me. It's time for class."" This was no ordinary hug either, it's like this man was trying to snap my spine. If I didn't have a text book covering my chest, he would hug from behind and try to squeeze my chest. 


One day he didn't get his way and a substitute said he can't sit next to me, as his seat in the seating chart is somewhere else. He started yelling and screaming at the sub and said that if he can't sit next to me then he would break up with me. The whole class looked shocked and looked at me, this was the first time I was hearing of this, and the first time he had said this to anyone as an excuse to sit with me. I was shocked that's what he thought this was. I said ""B I'm not your girlfriend. We are just friends."" Cue an even worse fit and the sub had to call security and they took him to the office and I think he got sent home.


He was still in my class and allowed to sit next to me for the rest of the year after that. Making kissy faces at me and trying to put his arm around me, claiming that one time I ""embarrassed him in front of the whole world"" was just us having a fight that day. It never mattered how many times I said no, or told the teacher that he makes me very uncomfortable because he says these things, I was always treated like the asshole.


Moral of the story, people with disabilities can 100% be an asshole like everyone else.

starterpacks,fozo9gv,t3_ga9pee,1588193987.0,"I mean, my sister and I would usually trade off taking the smaller or bigger piece. I don't remember when it started, but when it came to sweets, one of us would be like ""yeah sure."" Instead of a ""hell yeah"". Whoever said yeah sure usually got the smaller piece because that indicated that we didn't want alot of it."

AskMen,foooyif,t3_g8asyd,1587943399.0,"When I (20) go home in the summer from uni, I am the oldest so if I'm not working I'm usually taking care of my cousins while my aunts and uncles are at work. I go to one of my aunts houses and everyone drops off their kids and I'll watch them from about 8am-7pm, and they pay me for it too. At the time it was my second summer back, so I was 19.

This aunt's house has a large front yard with fence about 3ft high, and is a corner house near an on ramp to a popular freeway. The oldest kid I take care of is my sister at 16, but the second oldest is my 10 year old cousin, we'll call him K. Now K is a kid that has alot of energy to spare and maybe some anger issues. So K decides to be mean to his little cousin C (6F) and steals the ball she and my sister were playing with and throws it in the street and laughs. As I was going over to him to talk to him this kid sees me and full force runs at the gate, swings it open, and bolts into the street.

Now, I am not an athletic guy, especially not at the time. But the kid was in the middle of the street and I see this thic ass truck come turning the corner, and I swear the spirit of Barry Allen himself possessed me because I was able to run and pull the little fucker out the street seconds away from getting hit. I brought the kid back and made sure he was okay, and talked his ear off for a solid thirty minutes about how he ain't supposed to go into the street. I felt like a God for a solid week. But also a dumbass for not locking the gate."

Not only did I not know how to eat after I left home for college, but I also could eat an entire cake for a meal by myself. Nothing about not teaching kids what's bad and what is good is okay."
unpopularopinion,fob8gs7,t3_g6hhjc,1587657200.0,I (20M) understand your pain. It's hard as a gay guy to find someone who isn't just looking for dick. Like I want to find someone who I enjoy spending time with and could potentially be a long term partner. It might be worse since in college everyone is only looking to hook up.

And they would usually say it was a dare, lost a bet, or 5-20 bucks. I know at least some people felt bad for doing it, cuz I  found out from one of them about a year ago. I sometimes volunteer at my old highschool for my old choir teacher when I'm on break for uni, they were helping that day too and they apologised and said they knew it was fucked up, and they hope that I can forgive them. I did cuz kids do mean stupid shit, and he seemed genuinely sorry."
AskReddit,fmvkcp9,t3_fxjqxa,1586420124.0,"I taught middle schoolers for a summer at camp. It was a high end STEM camp for kids, this kid P was really young for this class, he was 9 and did some really good work when it came down to it. The usually super happy go lucky kid one day comes in looking super down, so I ask him how he is doing. He said that his younger sister J didn't like the eggs he made this morning and didn't want to eat his cooking. I told him it's ok that she didn't want to everyone had their own tastes, it's awesome that he knew how to cook. He turns to me and says ""yeah I cook because mom and dad usually aren't home, and Sitter isn't always around."" I asked what he meant by that and he said that his parents are often out of the country, sometimes for long periods of time, and the babysitter they pay for is only from after school to bedtime. I asked how he and gets to camp and he said the neighbors drive him, but when they don't answer the door he Ubers.

I almost cried then and there. I told my boss about it and she handled it from there. I don't know what happened to that kid but I really hope he has all the love in the world."
