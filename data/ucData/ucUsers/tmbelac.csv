UCSantaBarbara,fpmh2d2,t3_gebh5y,1588732918.0,Meh. This was expected. Hopefully there will be better news for Fall.
TikTokCringeAnarchy,fpey4bm,t3_gcm7nn,1588557457.0,thanks for ruining one of my favorite songs
UCSantaBarbara,fpa4wwn,t1_fpa26td,1588440880.0,"it took about 4 days. I had my first pass time on the 27th, my next one is on May 4th."
UCSantaBarbara,foue6tn,t1_fotg7lu,1588082348.0,"Yes I did. After you submit your SIR and you activate your U-mail, you can apply for summer sessions [here](https://www.summer.ucsb.edu/college/transfer-edge/application-fees). Then in a couple of days they send an email with the next steps."
UCSantaBarbara,fonhi28,t3_g8g84k,1587919593.0,"no offense, but a petition won't do much"
UCSantaBarbara,fol9m8g,t3_g831g5,1587857623.0,"if you look at some previous reddit posts, an incoming freshman got an email from the school that basically says to plan as if fall was going to be in person."
UCSantaBarbara,fojzmsq,t3_g7wb7k,1587832584.0,"I relate to you, I can't stand being at home anymore, and I'm also an incoming transfer. If summer session B goes online, they will not offer housing for new students. But, what you could do, is sublease an apartment. I've been looking and you can get a single for about $700 -$800. You can see the rooms that are available for subleasing on facebook if you search ""UCSB housing""."
UCSantaBarbara,fo9ll17,t1_fo9bfth,1587623124.0,I will!
UCSantaBarbara,fo9b98c,t1_fo95o22,1587614941.0,it was supposed to open today but i don't see a link to apply.
UCSantaBarbara,fo8jt9r,t3_g6bfhp,1587597945.0,"i was wondering this too, im going to email UCSB and ill pm you since your post might get taken down

edit: not sure why im getting downvoted if i asked the exact same question and my post got removed by mods"
UCSantaBarbara,fo8hufd,t1_fo8gvk1,1587596846.0,Thank you for your help though!
UCSantaBarbara,fo8gaae,t3_g3x6oh,1587595988.0,Got admitted today as a transfer! Iâ€™m interested in taking summer classes so how would I do that?
UCSantaBarbara,fo8ehae,t1_fo8edqj,1587595011.0,isn't fssp for freshmen? I'm a transfer
Transmedical,fo7wpsz,t1_fo7wfkv,1587585846.0,True
Transmedical,fo7uuqa,t1_fo76eu5,1587584937.0,That makes me really sad :(
Transmedical,fo5setx,t3_g5vcn9,1587534215.0,If I remember correctly Cavetown said something like that which made me sad because he has a huge platform to educate people.
UCSantaBarbara,fo5mnzw,t3_g5too3,1587529512.0,Fullerton starts in August so I think thereâ€™s hope.
UCSantaBarbara,fo5mm6h,t3_g5pslr,1587529473.0,Fullerton starts in August so I think thereâ€™s hope.
UCSantaBarbara,fo0q4g8,t1_fo0poyb,1587417696.0,"Thank you so much for your help! And UCSB will most likely have housing next year. The only issue I have is for summer sessions because if you are a new student, you can't get UCSB  housing if summer session B becomes remote. Anyways, thank you for your responses, I really appreciate it."
UCSantaBarbara,fo0p4xt,t1_fo0oeu1,1587417173.0,both. I think I've read that students lease their apartments?
UCSantaBarbara,fo0obag,t1_fo0nrhw,1587416735.0,sorry if this is a stupid question but how do I do that ðŸ˜…
TikTokCringeAnarchy,fnxzcea,t1_fnxz9mj,1587349703.0,Haha youâ€™re right I just didnâ€™t know where to put it
UCSantaBarbara,fnxkgpf,t3_g4htum,1587340505.0,Hopefully fall 2020 because I canâ€™t learn like this. If possible Iâ€™ll take a gap quarter and take classes at a CC because Iâ€™m not going to pay thousands of dollars for something where Iâ€™m not learning.
TikTokCringeAnarchy,fnxdoys,t3_g4h53i,1587336530.0,"Sorry for the cropping, I thought I had cropped it through my phones camera roll but reddit undid it"

UCSantaBarbara,fncntgg,t1_fncbfc1,1586841674.0,I know :( hopefully itâ€™ll be over soon but itâ€™s better we stay at home and are safe
UCSantaBarbara,fnbp9rc,t1_fnboajd,1586819652.0,true
UCSantaBarbara,fnbo0xr,t1_fnbnhub,1586818979.0,"same, I was looking forward to spending the summer in Santa Barbara. On the bright side, there's a possibility of session B being on campus since it's in August!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnb6pkr,t3_g0pn4r,1586810172.0,"they updated the site today, it says session A will be online. We won't know about session B until June."
TikTokCringeAnarchy,fn7ht2j,t3_g02nf5,1586720606.0,This man is trying so hard to flex his muscles heâ€™s gonna shit himself
4PanelCringe,fn73n7i,t1_fn6znsr,1586712655.0,I posted it in r/cringetopia a while back. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/byoibx/throwback_to_2012/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
UCSantaBarbara,fn233y1,t3_fyu5yw,1586576568.0,Iâ€™m also interested in it. I think you have to submit your SIR first but I emailed someone that works for UCSB summer and they said that the day we submit our SIR we can apply for housing. As for applying for the the program idk because I think itâ€™s new.
UCSantaBarbara,fmzn6kd,t3_fyb31t,1586525119.0,I feel you. Maybe session B will be in person and we can get housing then?
UCSantaBarbara,fmyt8gh,t3_fy8iwq,1586495059.0,Probably not if itâ€™s less than 6 units because you wonâ€™t get financial aid
TikTokCringeAnarchy,fmx9hxb,t3_fxyd47,1586460903.0,this is what turned him gay
UCSantaBarbara,fmwqe8z,t3_fxvlyb,1586451183.0,"hopefully session B will be in person, but it looks like Session A will be online."
UCSantaBarbara,fmsg8su,t1_fmsafhg,1586354832.0,that is not the way to do it. Getting into large groups right now is not safe.
UCSantaBarbara,fmr6zqh,t3_fwygdn,1586315355.0,that is fucked up
UCSantaBarbara,fmq7bib,t3_fwsubb,1586294217.0,They give financial aid (idk how much) but the campus based fee for undergrads is $490.50. The fin aid estimator comes out on the 15th.
UCSantaBarbara,fmfduri,t1_fmf9f2d,1586025179.0,if you don't want to come back to campus until fall either take online classes or don't come?
