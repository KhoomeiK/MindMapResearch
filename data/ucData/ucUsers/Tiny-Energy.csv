berkeley,fnr78gh,t3_g3drtx,1587181021.0,So pretty!
PMDD,fnk3xfb,t3_g286q1,1587014241.0,"Mine was really great about it. She suggested coping strategies and making a “mental toolbox” of activities to do when I know it’s coming and they’ve been helpful to mitigate it - like reading, focusing on your thoughts and being kind to yourself and your brain, going for a walk and focusing on the senses like touch and sound. And recognizing that you can’t do your normal level of activity and that that is completely okay."
berkeley,fn5ddww,t1_fn29mze,1586661952.0,Yeah for sure. You can message me
berkeley,fn229z6,t1_fn1t7y1,1586575957.0,Hey! I also got accepted to UCSD for biochemical/chem in Muir and ultimately chose Cal for a chemical biology degree in the college of chemistry (classes are pretty similar to bio chem in L&S though). I really like Cal because the chemistry faculty are so passionate and excited about what they do. I also liked the professors that I’ve ultimately gotten to do research with. I chose Cal because it felt welcoming and personal and I looked at the department and liked it better. I think one thing to consider is thinking about quarter system vs semester system.
berkeley,fmnrkki,t1_fmnntbb,1586233314.0,Also didn’t put me at a disadvantage for 4B at all
berkeley,fmnriur,t1_fmnntbb,1586233277.0,"No my advisor said it was fine. Never had to take anything extra. Just 1A, 4B, and moved on to the 12 series no problem"
berkeley,fml1hnh,t3_fvub5g,1586176046.0,"I’m chem bio too (was admitted directly) and I took 1A (cause my HS didn’t have AP chem) and 4B. That option is still available if you want to do it. Took chem 1A with Giessler and it wasn’t bad at all, just gotta do the homework and they’re super generous on grading because there are so many people."
