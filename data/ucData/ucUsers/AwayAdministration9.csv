UCSC,fp6et48,t1_fp6bm68,1588351111.0,The show has a cool concept (Like most shows).  The only thing that brought me back was how cool our campus looks and Nick Offerman
UCSC,fp69fcv,t3_gb8vye,1588348447.0,What are everyone's thoughts on the show?
UCSC,fp64pw9,t1_fp3ki99,1588346034.0,Last quarter 140 was project-based.
UCSC,fp648hw,t1_fp447n0,1588345775.0,Your right Peter! Here you go OP it is May 29th!!!! Hope that was a timely response.
UCSC,fp3bwb5,t3_gaxthp,1588276619.0,"I have taken both. Personally, 140 teaches some topics you might not expect to be in an AI course.  If you are interested in what you hear in the headlines 144 is your best bet."
UCSC,fp3bggr,t1_fp0rm5w,1588276401.0,I was expecting a reply that would show me why asking Reddit is better than looking at the academic calendar.
UCSC,fp0nmie,t3_galkqc,1588212937.0,Why ask reddit this question?
UCSC,fp090dd,t3_gaj27j,1588204745.0,Just filled it out.  It had an option for two majors.
atheism,fov1szw,t1_fouhidz,1588094001.0,Same.  Some marking that will identify the true believers or some shit. Idk
UCSC,fouuy4q,t1_fouum5z,1588090825.0,well good luck to them
UCSC,fouu364,t1_fourlbj,1588090420.0,Are you talking about the covid-19 situation specifically or even before that?
UCSC,fourc1n,t1_fot8y47,1588089114.0,do people believe this?
UCSC,foreu99,t1_fokyem9,1588011027.0,"144, but this is only because we are online"
UCSC,foh8mvl,t3_g73mvr,1587761860.0,I took cse 140 last quarter and am currently in 144.  I  like her teaching style.   She teaches of her slides and writes over them with a surface pro.  The class converted to online fairly easily.  This quarter there is no major project.  Neither course has had a midterm or final just multiple quizzes that are fair but difficult.  I would take 144 over 140 because I think it is the material most people are expecting.
UCSC,fmpcpbd,t3_fwdk8c,1586278496.0,This may be a long shot but . . . I saw a lost poster for a black cat at the Bend Lomond feed store.  It was on a power pole on the left side street.
UCSC,fm1dyon,t1_flwb69v,1585676677.0,"Awesome, thank you for your help"
