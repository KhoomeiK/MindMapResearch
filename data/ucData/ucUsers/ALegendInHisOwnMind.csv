PublicFreakout,foyohcq,t1_foycg5p,1588176225.0,"Ok, so the thing is that there are certain times, especially when it’s nearly closing time, that the machine has either 1) already been cleaned and they don’t want to use it and have to clean it again or 2) it hasn’t been used all day and then some fat fuck comes around and asks for a McFlurry 2 minutes before closing time. In either scenario the person working for a shit wage is going to be like “naw, fuck that” but instead hits them with the “sorry, machine’s broken.” Can’t say that I blame them."
AskReddit,foxlwe9,t3_ga4gjx,1588148169.0,"Once on my birthday I was in the kitchen and was reading some schedule on the fridge when all of a sudden I heard the birthday song being whistled really nearby, like almost right behind me and very close to my right ear. I mindlessly began to hum along. Then it hit me. I was all alone at home and I had no fucking clue where, who, or what it came from even to this day. I ran out of my house and didn’t come back for the rest of the day."

berkeley,fonlv15,t3_g8an1k,1587921988.0,"It’s Cal. Most people have a chip on their shoulder or are socially awkward, which explains pretty much the three points you’ve made. A) they have to make it seem like they’re smarter than the next person (guys do it to each other, too); B) they’re scared to be alone in such a demanding major (this applies to pretty much any major at Cal honestly); and C) these are awkward people that have only ever hugged their moms and so don’t know how to be chill and subtle around women (some won’t ever learn and same applies to some females). 

Overall, I’m sure that there’s some really cool people out there regardless of gender. There has to be. You’re proof that there are. However, again, this is Cal and the majority of people here are so fucking awkward it’s hilarious."

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fnwact2,t3_g46bij,1587314569.0,This is most likely a violation of the Dr.’s 4A rights. That cop likely did not have any reasonable suspicion to ask him any questions and the Dr probably told him to fuck off and the cop didn’t like it.

MemeYourEnthusiasm,fn8z6hp,t1_fn89kzq,1586754335.0,"Also, “come on, man. I heard that you liked me.” Sounds like something someone came up with after thinking: what would Biden say? And hit it on the head, but that line just sounds so fabricated. Still, i believe that this could be 100% true, just not 100% convinced that it did."
