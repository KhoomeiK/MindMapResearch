Better than saying goodbye to a family member because of the times we’re in.

IRS,fofuky3,t3_g1puwz,1587743088.0,"I am happy to report that as of today the status changed to ""you qualify for this, but we need your bank info"".  It asked for the filing status and AGI from our *2019* return - so they must have finished processing it.  We only filed on the 14th.

FYI - we owed for 2018 and 2019 (my husband is self-employed) - we file married filing joint.

Good luck to everyone!"

IRS,fnqug17,t1_fnqu6hc,1587172477.0,"No dashes.  Upper/lower case doesn’t matter.  It’s just glitchy as hell and no one in this administration is willing to admit it. We just have to wait until it’s quietly fixed.  

There isn’t even a way of contacting anyone about it."
IRS,fnqsyxu,t1_fnqstqa,1587171562.0,Oh that’s really good to know - those on SSI should probably have been one of the first disbursements.
IRS,fnqk42w,t1_fnqjkun,1587166204.0,"Yes - when I enter her social / dob / address -it takes me to a screen that says ""Need more information"" - asks about her adjusted gross income / whether she got a refund or owed / how much she got back / had to pay/ routing # & checking account #

She didn't file for 2018, and in 2019 she only made $5000 at her first job in college, so she didn't even have to file, but we filed for her so she could get the stimulus check.  Obviously she didn't owe anything or get any kind of refund, but there is no option for that.  When you choose one, and enter the amount as zero, it just glitches up.

Apparently there is no such thing as 0."
IRS,fnqils2,t1_fnqi6xj,1587165343.0,"I did. I used Turbo Tax.  The issue I’m having right now though is that I’ve been locked out for “24 hours” for the last 48 hours.

Also, in trying to help out my daughter, I’m trying to put in her banking info, but since she didn’t need to file in 2018 and in 2019 she neither owed nor got a refund, we keep getting a “technical difficulties” screen.  It absolutely will not take “0” as an answer"
IRS,fnqha28,t1_fnqgzzt,1587164583.0,"I’m so glad that you finally got a result!

Hopefully it won’t be much longer for the rest of us"
IRS,fnqc4vh,t1_fnq95ki,1587161743.0,You can.  My daughter didn’t need to file a 2018 return.  The problem is you just haha was to wait for them to process the 2019 return and that could take a while
IRS,fnqavu1,t1_fnqach1,1587161052.0,"Also, if you don’t need to file for tax year 2018 you can use the IRS non filers tool to enter your banking info.

IRS,fnq8ioa,t1_fnq8c20,1587159728.0,"Yes. It might be delayed but once it is processed you can check the portal and it should have your info - it may ask you for your banking info.

This is the situation my daughter is in too"
