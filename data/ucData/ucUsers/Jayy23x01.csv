For 2 years I heard great things about it, a cinematic treasure apparently but when I saw that scene I was completely dumbfounded to how god awful that scene was... the dude looks nothing like Freddy, I have to commend the set and the accuracy of it but my god was that dude ugly, and the facial mannerisms were cringeworthy. This is a very unpopular opinion but It discouraged me from watching the movie."

UCI,fp0e6b3,t3_gadmnb,1588207535.0,"Past 2 weeks I've done not a single assignment, have not logged in to a single zoom session, haven't even seen a single word of material. Needless to say, I can't do this shit. I'm taking the L this quarter and couldn't give any less of a fuck about it. Fuck this shit."
UCI,fothzij,t3_g9hbph,1588054509.0,I don't have experience at all but I heard from a friend that yes Korea is very popular for study abroad but don't let this discourage you!
Sleepparalysis,fothvmh,t1_fosyz3o,1588054414.0,"Same here, the part I mentioned about my mind being fully awake but not my body I felt that a bit as I was initially falling asleep as well. However, I was pretty tired I had woken up at 6 am it was 12 pm and I had only gotten 4-5 hours of sleep so I needed the nap but of course this experience ruined the nap haha. I'm just glad I didn't see demons or feel the pressure on my chest as others describe. Hope this doesn't happen to me or to you again. Stay safe man."
Sleepparalysis,fosy0nl,t3_g9d879,1588040427.0,"The same thing happened to me today during a 10-15 minute nap beside the footstep part. Before the nap, I was trying to keep myself up because I was doing something on the computer but I fell asleep and when I tried to wake up I felt awake mentally but couldn't move and my eyes weren't opened yet but I could move my eyeballs. I can describe it as the way it feels when you say ""your leg is asleep"" and it's just numb, I was trying to move like my brain was sending the signals to the nerves to move but I couldn't. And as I started waking up I could feel my body wake up as if the numbness was going away. It started at my fingertips and went up to my arm and to my body and the same with my legs then I fully woke up. It was a weird experience but its the first time I've ever experienced it. Just hoping it doesn't happen again tonight or when I wake up in the morning."
modernwarfare,foi8ghw,t1_fo62d9q,1587780906.0,"Update: I just got into the queue for the chat and all that happens is they ask you for your Activision ID, Gamertag, and console and try to clear the cache. Once that doesn't work you send them a picture with the receipt of the purchase and make sure you're Gamertag/email is on screen as well to prove it's your account and they send it off to the higher-ups and give you a case number. So now I just have to wait to see if they can fix it or not but the guy told me its gonna take a while so probably not gonna get resolved too."
CODWarzone,fo57mup,t1_fk64i9r,1587519272.0,"Hello, I bought the battle pass edition of MW on Xbox about a week and a half ago and have not received my COD points, operator skins, or xrk weapons pack. Any resolve to this??"
modernwarfare,fo577xt,t3_g3wh8i,1587519012.0,"I'm having the same issue I bought it on the 14th and still no COD points, I have the operator pack downloaded but nothing in-game, no weapons pack, it's ridiculous. Can you update if your problem gets resolved?"

xboxone,fo56rst,t3_g5kvbn,1587518734.0,Ill try my luck

Sneakers,fnk8xx0,t1_fnk2x6v,1587018637.0,"On their website, it just says to contact them if you never receive your package but I don't really trust that, I might just deliver it to a relative's house in a safer area though."

xboxone,fn4qo7x,t1_fn2rpol,1586646897.0,"You're right, couldn't really tell from the video my bad."
xboxone,fn2pnqe,t3_fyztdk,1586598231.0,Is that decorative cover blocking the holes that are on top of the console? I can't tell through the video but if so then that where the hot air is released from the fan that cools the system which may be the cause for the noise and it may even slow down the system so you may want to uncover that :/ Cool design though.
xboxone,fn2phrc,t3_fz0buk,1586598037.0,Thanks :)
xboxone,fn2pflm,t3_fyh1ux,1586597966.0,Thanks OP!  :)
UCI,fmxzme0,t3_fy13k3,1586475041.0,"I'm worried about the deadline as well, I have to submit a document that I have to get from the IRS but their system isn't working so I can't even access the document."
UCI,fmu5ib7,t1_fmt54ba,1586384964.0,For a long time that is the exact thing I thought was going on every time I came back home but I never gave it attention because I didn't have work to do then :/ thus I haven't thought of associating a certain place with work for me the only place was the BioSci Library and the desk in my dorm room. But I like that approach of establishing a new place a lot it's very logical. I'm going to give the kitchen table another try without the presence of my phone or anything distracting or maybe even my garage if the kitchen table doesn't work out. Thanks for the suggestion!
UCI,fmu4otx,t1_fmsyc74,1586384526.0,"I'm going to need to look into the P/NP option for this quarter for some classes, but on what you said about the kitchen table I haven't given it a try because I just know it won't go well but I'm willing to try again. Someone else mentioned how the brain associates certain areas with things like work and relaxation. I'm going to try to make the kitchen table or maybe even my garage that designated area for work and see if it works out. Thanks for the suggestion and good wishes! I hope you are doing fine in this whole ordeal as well."
UCI,fmu4124,t1_fmsbqmk,1586384168.0,"I've been wanting to try this for a while but of course, haven't gotten the motivation for it ahaha. I've also heard of something similar called ""dopamine fasting"", I'm not sure if it works but I'm definitely willing to give it a shot. Thank you!"
UCI,fmu3ln1,t1_fmsssvc,1586383937.0,"Same, live lectures at least give me some sense of going to class but pre recorded classes just make it seem like it's optional when it's most definitely not ahaha."
UCI,fmu38zv,t1_fmso5f2,1586383749.0,"I've actually never thought of rearranging the room, that's actually a pretty good idea. I'm already getting ideas on what to do with it, hopefully this changes the feeling of being here. Thank you!"
UCI,fmu2pqy,t1_fmscucs,1586383464.0,"My family is just way too loud, nosey, and in my business that I just won't be able to concentrate if I do it there :/ and that's pretty much the only table in the house so the only ""workspace"" available to me at the moment is my bed which kinda sucks."
