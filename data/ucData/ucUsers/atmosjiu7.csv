UCSD,fpmv5jg,t1_fpmuqb3,1588742586.0,That is some great information thank you! Are you in the Scripps institute?
UCSD,fplqbo5,t3_fi9kzn,1588717442.0,"Hey y'all. 

Im an oceanic and atmospheric science major transferring from a CC. I have to choose between UC Berkeley and UCSD. The difference both schools are obviously location and the social life and prestige. My main concern is that UCB's atmospheric science program is a BA and UCSD's Oceanic and atmospheric science program is a BS. Ive heard that BAs in these degrees make significantly less (we're talking 50k compared to 90k), so thats something to consider. I'd like to know if anybody can confirm this. Also, is Scripps institution a world renowned institution as they say? 

Consider me a noob on this info. 

P.S. im not too worried about social life since im not a party goer or bar goer. I dont drink or smoke. I prefer school clubs, nature, and travel.

Thank you!"
berkeley,fpf0qg5,t1_fpezfod,1588559112.0,I usually tell them “La Universidad que está cerca de San Francisco”  LoL because they wouldn’t understand “Berkeley” either
ApplyingToCollege,fp4z29d,t1_fp4u7yo,1588311276.0,what school?  That’s intense
berkeley,fotboas,t3_fqdm9d,1588049407.0,"Anybody with knowledge on the Atmospheric Science program! 

It’s tough to find anybody majoring in atmospheric science at Berkeley. The website seems pretty vague on what the program is useful for in a career sense. I can’t tell if I can pursue a career in meteorology or not. I’d also like to know what other career potentials are possible and how the atmospheric science community is at Cal. Could I pursue a research path? What internship and study abroad opportunities are available?

I’m sorry if I sound a bit pushy, I’ve just had a tough week doing research on UC Davis, UCSD and UCB and it’s pretty draining and stressful. I appreciate any responses given. And I’m not as grouchy as this post may seem haha.

Bless your hearts!"
ApplyingToCollege,fok8tf8,t1_fok8p5m,1587837542.0,Thanks for the felicitations! Yeah I’ve no clue either lol. It is a state school.
ApplyingToCollege,foibcur,t3_g7cmkh,1587782738.0,UC Berkeley gang!! I’m fine with that.
UCSD,fo81bii,t3_fi9kzn,1587588144.0,"So I will be transferring into Oceanic and Atmospheric science. Of what I’ve seen, it appears to focus mostly on the ocean (reasonable since it’s on the coast). What kind of courses can I expect? Also, Can this major land me a job in Weather forecasting or NOAA research? I’m not too sure how all of this works. Thanks."
UCDavis,fnyex92,t1_fnyevc8,1587361085.0,That’s epic. Well probably end up linking up some way or another!
UCDavis,fnydbrk,t3_g4gm5u,1587359786.0,Hey I just got accepted on Thursday as a transfer too (From SoCal) and I’ve decided to go to Davis! I love music too! Especially classical. Hope we meet each other there randomly haha.
UCDavis,fnifbaa,t1_fni7udt,1586979021.0,Exactly. I agree. I can’t go visit any school to make a decision. I’m just blindly choosing a school based on anecdotes and virtual tours (which are not the same)

und,fnbj7bt,t1_fnbj10o,1586816484.0,Haha I think I’ll be good at complaining at the cold. How are the snow storms there? Are they substantial or just like a couple of hours of snow
und,fn8ph17,t1_fn8papd,1586746961.0,Thank you that helps a ton!
und,fn8ja8f,t1_fn8iwo3,1586742928.0,That’s awesome. I’m a transfer from Cali considering schools
und,fn8ir1n,t1_fn8gvcf,1586742584.0,I’m sure race relations have gotten better so I’m hopeful with that answer!
und,fn8ioc7,t1_fn8hypi,1586742535.0,That’s definitely reassuring thanks
oddlyterrifying,fn7hnc9,t1_fn7hf6c,1586720516.0,I feel ya. Went to Phoenix last summer. 114 degrees. You win there bro. But at what cost
