If greater, replace change with range and set person = student. Then you can return the “person” after the loop."

[Age as Integer](https://imgur.com/CURPKq4)"
codehs,fnrb3z1,t1_fnr7a9h,1587183863.0,"Oh. Then it is very simple.

Python does not require that you define a variable type. So just set name equal to ""Arthur"". The quotes are important because that is what tells the compiler that this is a string. For age, you can go one of two ways. The first is save age as a string (i.e ""62"") using quotes. This is not the standard way to handle printing an integer within a string. The other way is to set age equal to 72 (no quotes to let the compiler know that it is not a string) and convert to a string in the print statement.

I will reply to this with the solution but you should try it on your own first."

The JavaScript equivilant to read an integer is readInt(). so it would look something like:

var d1 = readInt(""Enter the value for the first dice: "");

Do the same thing for d2, just change the prompt to match.

The input validation should be similar. Just change ""and"" to ""&&"" and add brackets around the if statement. 

Then the only thing to fix is ""print"" becomes ""println"".
