UCI,fpj80ag,t3_gdhoxb,1588659362.0,"I'd talk to someone in the Humanities student affairs office about deferring your enrollment. Transferring is a big accomplishment, and you deserve the full college experience, especially since you only have two-three years here."
UCI,fp8v8nb,t1_fp8trml,1588404144.0,"No, it was last quarter, so this quarter their circumstances might've changed, but who really knows. Like for example, the whole ""P/NP all quarter"" thing is supposed to help students out who may be struggling with focusing on their classes, but since it is past week 2 there's still a possibility that they will reject applications for P/NP depending on how many exceptions you've asked for in the past. So yeah, it might seem like they'd be understanding and flexible and aware of everyone's situations, but you never know."
UCI,fp8qqfk,t3_gakbt2,1588399913.0,"UCI's film program is structured by the Film, & Media studies major in the School of Humanities with a minor in Digital Filmmaking in the School of the Arts. The FMS major, like already said, is emphasizing study and research and not production. Digital film is more hands on and is a great addition to the major, but from what I understand the humanities and arts do not really work together much, so you might feel kinda separated"
UCI,fp8q3ge,t1_fp4b4fw,1588399349.0,"Seriously. At this point, grades are just measures of how someone's mental health is coping, not about who actually has the motivation to learn. Super unfair."
UCI,fp8pj1i,t3_gbwh1e,1588398861.0,"I've heard of someone who was taking a class for a minor, but decided to drop the minor, so they wanted to drop the class but they weren't able to. Not sure if they were a senior though."
UCI,fp08kng,t3_gadmnb,1588204504.0,"I JUST emailed my professor a question i had about something from our practice test and I completely forgot that I asked him the SAME question in a discussion forum that he already answered, stating it wouldn't be on the exam. My brain is so wiped I'm dead and embarrassed."
UCI,fp06j5f,t3_ga76ur,1588203416.0,They will most likely allow people to cancel their contracts like they did for spring
UCI,fp06dv1,t3_ga13h2,1588203335.0,I miss going on runs around there ;(
UCI,foxasva,t3_g9wa3m,1588138529.0,"In terms of the area, I go to UCI but my hometown is by UCSB, and I much prefer SB. It's not a major city or anything, but I think it has more character than Irvine. In Irvine, it's mostly just shopping centers  and places to eat, and some nature preserves, and the beach in Newport. Santa Barbara/Isla Vista is gorgeous compared to Irvine, and there's much more charm and more interesting things to do. Though, Irvine is closed to LA and Long Beach which are bigger cities than those close to Santa Barbara, so you're not totally isolated, but you'd really need to have a car."
UCI,foxais9,t3_ga0iln,1588138305.0,"If you're asking about SPOP, they've already started training and are working on doing online workshops w freshmen"
UCI,fotk7n7,t3_g9ghti,1588056490.0,"Yeah, same ;( I just got a C on a one page paper that I thought was easy, and the TA said it was fine before I submitted it too. Really disheartening, and hard to want to try anymore."
UCI,fop0s19,t1_fonxinh,1587950560.0,"That's true, but the first death from the virus wasn't until February, so it's a different timeline."
UCI,fonw03x,t1_fonb5y5,1587927562.0,"Enrollment starts in mid-May, so professors who were planning on in-person courses (specifically for labs and performing arts) need to know something by then."
UCI,fomaf7t,t1_fom9za3,1587883198.0,"Arts in general. A lot of people aren't fortunate enough to have spaces at their homes, especially if they've moved back in with families, where they can dance, make art, or perform. W/ art it's flexible, but dance, drama, and music can't do anything to the fullest capacity. They aren't getting the experience they need and aren't going to learn as much. Paying thousands of dollars for basically nothing. Not to mention that any gigs they might get after graduation are totally blown due to inability for large groups to gather."
UCI,fom6hwo,t3_g7njdl,1587879723.0,Reach out to your academic advisor asap
UCI,fom60du,t1_fojw1qi,1587879320.0,it's been really difficult for people in the arts tho. Paying thousands of dollars to basically...not be able to do your major.
UCI,foevz0z,t3_g6e4tc,1587716681.0,"Right now it seems likely that UCI will be going online for the fall, so getting housing at ACC might be really easy or really hard. Easy because people might be getting rid of their leases if the university doesn't offer to pay the cancellation fees like they did this year. Possibly harder if they want to reduce as many people in the complexes as possible."
UCI,foevt5w,t3_g6dcv0,1587716516.0,"Best case scenario is that in person classes would start in winter quarter (if there isn't a second wave like the news is saying :c ) and then they would resume dorming and guaranteed housing. After all the money they've lost this quarter, they would not want to miss out on a chance to opening up housing again if they can do it safely."
UCI,foesf05,t3_g708o5,1587713161.0,Can't say I'm surprised :(
UCI,focat9j,t3_g6rl93,1587669130.0,"Yes, allowing yourself to feel the emotions is really important to help you accept the new reality. It's all really scary especially when we all still have school, but if you can try and take a few hours for yourself so that you don't get too stressed with constant school work."
UCI,fo90m5y,t3_g5z6g2,1587607868.0,"From what I've heard from our academic counselors, grad programs will start raising eyebrows when you have around 2-3 P/NP grades and it really looks like you're ""hiding"" something. One P/NP grade, especially during COVID, will not rub them the wrong way at all. I'm sure they understand that many other students got put in the same situation as well."
UCI,fo901k5,t3_g64976,1587607502.0,"Cried in my first zoom meeting last week yippee. It was also in a one-on-one meeting w the partner of my (former?) ab*ser. Long story. At least she was nice about it, though."
UCI,fo7pl7s,t1_fo7owm5,1587582353.0,"I have a lease with ACC the upcoming year, so they'll probably only give us a certain window where we can cancel our leases. If I do keep it and it turns out the whole year goes online, then I'm out of luck. I'm also an art major, and doing art online classes are basically total bs and a waste of tuition."
UCI,fo7osgm,t3_g5sw3h,1587581966.0,"As the other person said, if fall goes online and possibly winter as well, the school will do their best to allow people to get out of their leases. It's scary, I know, but they wont leave the students stuck, especially since so much is unknown right now."
UCI,fo7oloa,t3_g5mvto,1587581874.0,"If fall AND winter are going to be online until there's a vaccine, I'm just going to drop out and *hopefully* come back next year."
UCI,fnaumfa,t3_fx91yd,1586804109.0,"Seriouslyyyy. One of my professors assigned 150 pages of reading over the weekend, like ugh. Why assign more work at a time like this."
UCI,fn8pe6e,t1_fn7yei4,1586746910.0,I would say email one of the academic counselors.
UCI,fn5oh6h,t3_fzjvgv,1586670655.0,"You can make a mask with a t-shirt and rubber bands. You should be able to find a tutorial online. Yes, it's not as effective as a medical grade mask, but those are reserved for medical professionals and essential workers, so just with the state of things, fabric is the best you can do."
UCI,fmvchgx,t3_fxlz0h,1586412346.0,"You can look at the major requirements for each through the general catalogue, or through DegreeWorks and the ""what if"" option"
UCI,fmvcege,t3_fx91yd,1586412271.0,yeah one of my classes that was going to drop the lowest quiz score is now counting all of the quizzes with the change to online....like how does that benefit us during this stressful time
UCI,fmuj67q,t3_fxfss3,1586392450.0,"im in soc sci 10C and we still haven't gotten our first lecture yet, so you never know. You might be able to catch up."
UCI,fmuj0zd,t1_fmu2pqy,1586392367.0,"if you need help tuning out noise, I've always listened to white noise on my headphones. There are apps w different white noise options, or you could look some up on youtube. Unlike listening to music, it shouldn't distract too much from your homework."
UCI,fmmolq9,t1_fmmnnps,1586209122.0,The mesa towers and the mesa classics are in mesa court. The ME towers and ME classics are in Middle Earth.

This is from the Orange County Health Officer from March 17th. I'm pretty sure it was forwarded to all VDC residents too, so they should know what they're risking by having parties. Who knows if people will actually get arrested, but yeah"
UCI,fmiyt5h,t1_fmiwpu7,1586119643.0,My roommates from VDC had a party last night. Saw it through their snapchat stories since I went home.
