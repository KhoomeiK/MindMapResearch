AskAnAmerican,fondu9c,t1_fol9wmw,1587917583.0,"To add to u/cmdrcaboose2 point, Trump is an elitist looking out for his fellow elitists through his policies. His tax plan and his deregulation ensure the American dream is harder to achieve by this disadvantaged. 

I would also argue Trump‚Äôs nomination demonstrates the influence of celebrities. In the last 50 years, Trump, Regan, and Schwarzenegger were celebrities leveraging their fame to successfully run for public office."

screeps,fnk3ijc,t3_g251so,1587013896.0,Thanks for the great video. I took a look at your Screeps tutorial series. I'd love if you did a topic on room expansion. I was into Screeps for a few weeks a few years ago trying to fully automate my bot. I found the concept of expanding into another room too difficult to integrate with my existing code base / screep logic. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject.
