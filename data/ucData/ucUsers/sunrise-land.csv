Geffen Playhouse, next to Ralphs. They have the best live shows this side of Broadway, and UCLA students can get [same-day tickets](https://www.geffenplayhouse.org/tickets/special-programs/) for only $15. If you don't go to UCLA, you'd be paying $100-150 or more for a good ticket. It's a great date idea, or place to go with friends."

ucla,fphqibs,t1_fphjf8f,1588625950.0,"You can run a referendum; referenda can either increase or decrease fees. This mechanism is already in place.

The downside: USAC would not vote in favor of putting the referendum on the ballot, so in order to get it onto the ballot in the first place, you'd have to collect signatures from the student body instead of going the ""easier"" route and requesting USAC approval. This means you'd have to run two campaigns: one to get the referendum on the ballot, and another to make it succeed during the actual election."

ucla,fois9i2,t1_fois19g,1587795365.0,"Have you asked the sublessor to release you from the contract? If they end up keeping the half-month's rent, that may just be the cost of having them hold the place for you."
ucla,foiro3y,t3_g7ob3t,1587794828.0,What's in the contract? Did you pay a deposit? Many subleases in Westwood aren't even technically allowed under the original lease.

ucla,fnuesg6,t3_g3y27y,1587260443.0,"Note that the referendum gives $45 to ASUCLA, and some amount of it would go to a Black Resource Center. It does not specify how much of the money would go to this center... most likely, $4 or less per quarter (assuming the resource center takes half a million dollars to run each year). The rest would go to ASUCLA."
ucla,fnt8p3y,t3_g3qwtt,1587236767.0,"I believe the ballot order is selected based on a process overseen by the USAC Election Board. The election board is appointed by USAC and has to answer to USAC, but their members are semi-independent insofar as they aren't involved in any USAC offices. The shortened referendum language also has to be approved by the UC Office of the President for no clear reason (if students wanted to challenge this restriction, they would probably win)"
ucla,fnlpeyl,t1_fnkeco1,1587057457.0,">Or am i missing something?

OP is a novelty account that isn't tied to the Daily Bruin. Judging by the other comments, though, it seems like OP succeeding at making people think they're real. cc u/espntheocho4"
ucla,fnjn9lz,t1_fnj8omc,1587002577.0,"In fairness to UCLA, nearly all of that money is highly restricted in how it can be spent based on what the donor requested at the time they gave it to the university.

That said, it's time for Gene Block to call up every billionaire in LA County and ask for them to pitch in for COVID-specific assistance."
ucla,fnb4jdw,t3_g0pz3d,1586809085.0,"Some of these fees, like the Kerckhoff Seismic Fee and Wooden Center Fee, are repayment of construction bonds from years ago. I don't know if ASUCLA has tried to defer bond payments due to the pandemic, but if not, they're still on the hook for paying (and their funding mechanism is student fees so you're on the hook for paying ASUCLA)"
ucla,fn7x117,t3_fzr5ac,1586729343.0,"Unfortunately the UC still has to pay professors' salaries, health insurance costs, repayments on bond debt for past construction, etc..."
ucla,flhkf1q,t1_flhhtpr,1585164344.0,You can always try to sublet the apartment for a couple months to recoup some money. I'm not sure how many people will be moving into Westwood for the time being though :/
