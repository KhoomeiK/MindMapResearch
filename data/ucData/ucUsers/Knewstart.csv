Oh wait, no you didn’t read it.  You blatantly did what you are accusing r/politics of doing. 

It’s kind of funny except for the obvious uneducated stance."

There’s a phenomenon called the illusory truth effect.  The more you seek out information about conspiracy theories the more likely you’re going to believe them.

worldpolitics,foyi2my,t1_foyh0hu,1588172911.0,"I’m asking for 10 very clear lies from a single person like I can find from President Trump easily. 

Going back 4 years and looking over multiple people I’m sure I can find “dozens” but if I did the same with President Trump I would find tens of thousands.  And quantity matters. 


So I ask again, can you take one elected official, Pelosi or Schiff works, and detail out 10 lies that you say are so easy to find from the last 3 months and post them here. 

You sound very upset and I’m not meaning to upset you. But I couldn’t find 10 lies in the 6 months from Pelosi but I could find 10 lies in the last six months about Pelosi from Donald Trump. 


If you can’t find those lies, I understand."

I’m not trying to be difficult but I guarantee I can find that many from Trump easily so if it is so bad, you should be able to find 10 on Pelosi or 10 On Schiff (I don’t mean ten on random Democrats all over America both Elected officials and administrators, but specifically one elected official)."

However, we don’t know what they knew. They were involved in private congressional meetings about the coronavirus. So does it give a bad impression?  Yes.  Is it Prosecutable (I know big word)?  That’s why we need an investigation.

Can you tell me why you are so certain that these Congressmen and senators weren’t privy to information the rest of us weren’t?  Republican Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) unloaded up to a million or more dollars’ worth of stock last month. Reports suggest they **publicly expressed confidence— while privately voicing alarm — ** over the nation’s ability to handle the covid-19 crisis. Reporters have raised similar questions about stock sales by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), although it is unclear whether they personally directed those trades. 

Wouldn’t the proper thing to do when something looks like a crime is to take the time to investigate it?"

You forget that at this time the government AND these officials were telling the public it wasn’t a big deal. If it wasn’t a big deal then why did they stock up on medical stock?  And what they knew is not public knowledge. 

Seems to me you aren’t thinking clearly. You might want to research the Stock Act before you continue to hurl insults at others’ education."
