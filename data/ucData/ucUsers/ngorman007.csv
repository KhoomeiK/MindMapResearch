I had never programmed in R before, but I did have experience with Python (Data 8, CS61A)!"
berkeley,foe8wze,t3_g70ufy,1587698441.0,"I can't say anything about 131A (because I haven't taken it), but I am currently taking 133 right now, and here are my thoughts:

Stat 133 is not a very big time sink. During a ""normal"" semester, the final exam is worth 50% of your final grade (now it's 40%), the rest being homework and lab. Prof Sanchez is a pretty good professor....nothing special, not too memorable, but solid overall. He is very approachable in OH and on Piazza (the later less so), and is good at answering questions. The biggest problem with 133 is the grading structure. The labs are graded on ""sincere effort"" (i.e. completion), but the homeworks are graded *very* harshly, and the grading criteria are not clear *at all* to the students.....it's been pretty frustrating at times. The homeworks are sometimes not written very clearly, so there have been some discrepancies in grading. Besides that, it's a good class, and R is a cool language, and I found the course material overall pretty useful. If you do decide to take 133 (either with 131A or not), make sure to be very meticulous when doing the homework!

P.S. note that I am taking 133 this semester, so take my advice with a grain of salt :))))"

As others have said, Econ 140 is a very stats-heavy class, so having knowledge from Data 8/Stat 88/Stat 20/Stat 135 is quite necessary (unless of course, you want to self-study to beef up on stats)."

berkeley,fo0y14r,t1_fo0wgvf,1587421924.0,"Just look at your APR dude....it's pretty clear that what I said earlier is the case.

As an example, I am declared in both Econ and Stats, and my two intermediate Econ courses (micro and macro) satisfied the 6 UD units outside of my major for Stats, and Stat 133/134 did the same for Econ."
berkeley,fo0uc70,t1_fo0hxft,1587419912.0,Your advisor is incorrect. Your first major's UD courses count for the 6 units outside of your second major (and vice versa).
berkeley,fnxwegx,t3_g4hs6k,1587347785.0,"Can't speak for Haas, but for Econ, lots of those upper division electives have 100/101A as a prereq (obviously not a strict requirement, but you have to know some micro). It seems like it would be wise to take 100A as soon as possible. 

Also, are you struggling in Data 8 because of the coding or the stats component?"
berkeley,fnvvwrq,t1_fnuxi04,1587306018.0,"Second this...Econ 100A/B only assumes some math knowledge (basic derivatives, LaGrangian Optimization, etc)."

berkeley,fng6cwa,t3_g1f9xd,1586923407.0,"Haven't taken 141, but I know that the Econ department in general does not enforce prereqs. If you've taken Stat 140 and Math 54, you definitely have the proper background for Econ 141! From what I have heard, 141 is very statistics-heavy, so the knowledge from Stat 140 will come in handy. Additionally, least-squares and SVD from Math 54 will likely be useful. 

Again, haven't taken the class, so I'll leave it up to someone else to comment on the class workload!"

**However**, Econ 2 is only taught in the Spring, so if you absolutely need to take the Econ prereq now, go for Econ 1."

Also, don't underestimate the behavioral questions that they will likely ask you. 

Most importantly, though, be prepared to accept the fact that they won't accept you solely on the fact that they don't envision you as ""TBG material"" based on your personality. As such, apply for multiple groups (even though it's hard because all of the infosessions/workshops are during the same week). Good luck!"

berkeley,fmsyeyq,t3_fx9ba6,1586363952.0,"I'm no CS major but Math 54 is much better at teaching LinAlg (though it also has DiffEqs, which is, for the most part, superfluous for a CS hopeful such as yourself). On the other hand, EE16A has the circuits section, which is important for 16B, BUT apparently circuits is taught extremely poorly in the 16 series. Overall, it would probably be better for you to take 54 and learn curcuits by yourself in prep for 16B. 

The 16 series is an absolute mess, so it's probably best to avoid it as much as you can (unless you are interested in EE)."

You'll be taking the same courses (except for CS61C, which I don't think is a requirement for DS), and your opportunities post-graduation will not be impacted in any significant way. The only significant difference is enrollment priority. As a DS major, it's going to be more difficult to take UD CS courses (the popular ones like CS170, CS189, etc) as declared CS majors usually have prioritized enrollment."
