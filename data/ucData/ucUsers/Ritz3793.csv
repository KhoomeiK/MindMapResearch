UCSD,fp05sfx,t3_g9zmsb,1588203018.0,"I’m at the Village and I haven’t stepped outside except to go to the market once a week. Ralphs delivers groceries for a $10 delivery fee and that’s still cheaper than on-campus markets. There are a few students here, and I seem to hear someone screaming at least once a week. Other than that, it’s pretty dead."

buildmeapc,fof6dew,t1_foepsnf,1587727582.0,How?
AskReddit,fnlz2vz,t1_fnjoeut,1587062243.0,"Try out My Plate, it’s a calorie tracking app. Honestly your diet decides most of your weight. You really cannot outrun a terrible diet. The exercise is for further toning, but focus on diet first. It’s not the teasing that should bother you the most. The biggest concern is the fat choking your organs and blood vessels, till they degrade and stop working. I’m 20, but since my dad’s diabetic I make sure to come back to a healthy BMI right after I realise that I’ve touched overweight. Do the transformation for yourself and your husband, so that you can live longer and healthier. Screw those people."

MonsterLegends,fn5u5qu,t1_fn1dttj,1586675994.0,"Ah sorry then. Also u don’t have to be good at it, just make sure you increase the number of islands and habitats and breed all the breedable legendaries. That should give you enough monster power. Generally having high monster power means that you have a lot of monsters and habitats and farms, which are needed for most quests."
MonsterLegends,fn1299t,t1_fn043fe,1586553345.0,"Look up “Goddess of fire”, if u have over 10k Monster Power and can cross 1k points and do wars you’ll fit right in. We always get the monster, and ppl are only kicked for not participating."
OnePunchMan,fmvkt0r,t1_fmvgr53,1586420608.0,Lol yeah
memes,fms1dnk,t1_fms0qaa,1586343221.0,I mean...if ur not using anything that’s connected to ur bank or professional accounts then there’s not much they can do...also what was the result of the breaches? Did anyone lose important information?
OnePiece,fms11zi,t1_fmqg6fj,1586342886.0,"Or should’ve just put “pre-timeskip” in the title. But hey it’s still Luffy, and a good imitation too."
memes,fmrxj9u,t1_fmruxyh,1586339165.0,"Yeah, I guess that’s what they’re talking about...the original still doesn’t exist."
memes,fmrxgb0,t1_fmrw4zh,1586339076.0,Well CP rewritten is pretty safe...also just don’t respond to personal questions and don’t use your primary email...they can’t get any more info out of you. You can even use your phone’s hotspot or a public wifi network if you don’t want your location recorded.
MonsterLegends,fmnvx0n,t1_fmnvm94,1586236840.0,"Ah ok...just thought that since you paid for katufo you would have definitely gotten a free mythic like cyberiel. I’d recommend checking the super effective type chart...even a metal legendary with strength runes would be a good counter, just pair it with a massive tank."
MonsterLegends,fmnvbfr,t3_fwc19u,1586236328.0,Why didn’t you use Cyberiel? The two single target metal moves are enough to take out a wyrmlad if you use strength runes(lvl 6+). Also why no tank? Or was Gadaigo the tank?
UCSD,fm6h3d0,t1_fm4k9uv,1585793913.0,Thank you
