UCSC,fniy34t,t3_g20zkq,1586988420.0,"my friend who was in his class like fall quarter or something had the same issue & iâ€™m in the class right now too!! i think that writing more and writing as much as you can based on what you think heâ€™s asking has been helping me??? because thereâ€™s so much, pick out key words in the question and figure out exactly what is he asking like explain or analyze or whatever, otherwise resort to the thing above. write full & complete sentences too!!! and make sure your answer is coherent and not all over the place! if it gets confusing, itâ€™s harder for the TAs to understand what you mean & itâ€™s especially harder for TAs with english as a secondary language to grade it! itâ€™s not much but thatâ€™s at least what iâ€™ve been told from past students :)"
UCSC,fkzd8zq,t3_fl2bvw,1584668301.0,"donâ€™t do kresge theyâ€™re remodeling and itâ€™s gonna be a mess there, especially next year considering current circumstances. iâ€™m a porter first year affiliate & i came in w/ almost no skill in arts or whatever & everyone was super welcoming! i actually learned a lot, like the uke and some art stuff. porter is super drug friendly like i donâ€™t think i know one person in my building who is against stuff like that. i originally did summer academy and everyone shat on porter for some reason but i honestly fell in LOVE with it. the porter meadows are right behind it & itâ€™s literally the most beautiful thing ever (especially if you ever plan on doing any sort of psychedelic LOL)! sometimes the people in porter can be irritating bc some of them are HIPPIE hippies like they be smelly (at this point i make it a joke but itâ€™s not really that huge of a deal) but iâ€™m honestly so thankful i choose porter as my number one! i met the most genuine people at this college because everyone is so accepting and really just be minding their own business iâ€™m really sad i had to change my affiliation so i can do an apartment with my friends on the other side of campus but iâ€™ll always be a porter kid at heartðŸ˜Ž"
