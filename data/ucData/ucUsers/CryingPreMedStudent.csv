UCSD,fpe5i9n,t1_fpdcby8,1588540754.0,I love Tsai man. He’s busting his butt in order to provide his students as close to an in-person experience but virtually through his physics lab videos. Bless his soul. He’s one of the rare professors that dedicates himself to the education of his students instead of doing it for the money.

UCSD,fp4dko1,t3_gb7pw3,1588296770.0,"I’m currently taking chem 143B with ternansky, and it’s hell for me. The workload isn’t even too much but class itself sucks being taught online (and other reasons, someone posted about it on here). I took chem 100A with slader during the winter, and if you personally prefer spending time in lab like I do, I’d wait and do other courses you need to take before taking chem 100A. 
Chem 100A with slader had lengthy lab reports though. Just a precaution. Really great professor tho."
UCSD,filaory,t1_fikvqek,1582497324.0,"I mainly looked at hybridization of the nitrogens, what functional groups are near the nitrogen, and the resonance for conjugate acids. 
But yeah I thought it was waaaay easier than the first one. I felt so underprepared for the first one."
