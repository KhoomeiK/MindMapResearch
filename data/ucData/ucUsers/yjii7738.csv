ucr,fp8hbhe,t1_fp8g2ri,1588392297.0,"Whoops, I didn't see that. I also used this to see how much we're supposed to received if it was a fixed amount. It was: $1,242.98. Now my concern is where the leftover money will be allocated in. The fund was supposed to be 50/50 between school and students, and we are not getting the fixed amount, so where is it being distributed? idk lol

Also, UCR is not dry.

VT is cool and all but out of state tuition isn’t. With UCR, you’ll be more flexible with spending without worry as much about loans or whatnot. Out of Campus housing is cheap here too."

ucr,fnmeweo,t3_g2mwrd,1587070184.0,"Depends on what other classes you might need. I’m a transfer student who got into CS but then switched into CSBA (more requirements). I took 4 classes every quarter since I transferred, 5 last quarter, and expected to take 2 in the summer. I had an internship last summer, so I didn’t take any summer courses, but if I took summer courses, I would’ve been done Spring 2020 instead of Summer 2020. 

So yeah it’s possible. My advice is to have fun in college haha. Enforce time management and balance your activities. CS gets rough, especially as a transfer you are making a huge transition. Also, find internships! Involve yourself in organizations, and eat healthy haha"
