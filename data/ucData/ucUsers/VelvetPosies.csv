Only one of my four professors understands this, and the rest of them are just increasing the workload. It just feels chaotic to me idk"
ucla,fonmcdl,t1_foiw8aa,1587922246.0,Congrats!
ucla,fonlrs6,t1_fonfc92,1587921940.0,"I can see that, but my major is something that is highly interesting to me, and so are the elective/major classes. It’s just a general “slow” feeling that I’m experiencing this quarter, that I haven’t experienced in the past. With everything in the world looming over my head, it’s hard to prioritize. 

I also used to live in the dorms, my life was more routine there, studying in the study rooms was my thing, and that has been stripped away. Now I’m back to my cramped house with more distractions and zero focus. It’s not a good situation but I’m pushing myself now to see this through."

My question is, what is your idea of a woman? And second to that, what is your idea of a black woman? What does a black woman look like to you? And how do you align yourself with that vision. If you aren’t aligning yourself with that vision, of course you don’t feel connected. 

It’s easy to not accept yourself as a woman, as well as a woman of color in this society. There’s a lot of forces working against you. Although when you consider how resilient and strong we are despite of adversity, you learn to appreciate yourself and your culture. 

I’m a bit like you. I never found myself getting along with other black woman; I wasn’t like my peers. It was a journey of my own, I became educated, I accepted my beauty, I did some spiritual work, I travelled outside of the US (this is important), and I explored my sexual being. By learning myself, I learned to appreciate others and their place in this world; I loved myself and loved others simply for their presence. I became who I am now, and started to attract black women who were just like me. 

My advice to you is first, accept yourself as a black person: we have a deep history, we are the first humans, our culture is so interesting it’s mimicked constantly, we are strong, we are original, we are real and truthful, we are unapologetic, we are leaders, we are talented, we are proud, and we are beautiful. 

Second, accept yourself as woman: you carry feminine energy that is captivating and powerful, you’re beautiful, you’re a mother, a sister, a daughter, you’re capable, you are strong. You can move mountains. Last, learn about yourself: learn who you are, travel, connect with others, develop your spiritual self, develop self care, and be healthy. 

It’s a beautiful journey. There’s something magical about being a black woman, and it’s exciting to discover that."
