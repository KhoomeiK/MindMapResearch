UCSantaBarbara,fpl2f4d,t3_ge1gux,1588705173.0,one person's GEs are another person's major classes :/
UCSantaBarbara,fpejnn7,t1_fpe5b5h,1588548844.0,"yeah, but the school needs the tuition money as revenue. once you kick someone out, they're unlikely to keep paying tuition-- it's not favorable for them to purge their biggest income source

in this way, tuition money is like an undergrads' bargaining chip."
rutgers,fpc5dbs,t1_fnsrp96,1588488149.0,"""There is nothing wrong in taking pleasure in catching students who choose to cheat.""

it really sucks that college professors are not required to have any kind of pedagogical training whatsoever"

UCSantaBarbara,fnpu7cr,t3_g1c6qa,1587152080.0,i think a lot of departments changed their policies after students emailed in complaints
UCSantaBarbara,fnptcdj,t1_fnmrcbv,1587151632.0,"Undergraduates at UCSB work more full time hours than faculty members. While their salaries are minuscule, the number of undergraduates employed makes it a not-insignificant sum."
UCSantaBarbara,fmp7ttp,t3_fwc60f,1586276042.0,follow up with your TA- there have been a lot of issues with eGrades and GOLD and they might have missed your email. also lots of NGs being assigned for late grades submitted b/c of coronavirus. i would email them again
UCSantaBarbara,fmp6h8k,t3_fwaq7l,1586275327.0,a group of undergrads are trying to connect with each other to respond to the forced apartment relocations-- email [ucsbcoronahousing@gmail.com](mailto:ucsbcoronahousing@gmail.com)! There will also be a town hall meeting about the relocations on Wednesday (4/8) at 5pm! RSVP: bit.ly/UCSBtownhallRSVP
