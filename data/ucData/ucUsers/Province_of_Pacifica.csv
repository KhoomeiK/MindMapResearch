The government had transitioned into what I like to call ""a sort of realistic exaggeration of the current situation"" where the US has become a dystopia (or more so depending on your political views). It reached the point where a few weeks before the pandemic reached critical levels on the left you had socialist and communist forces and on the right, you had the forces of a Christian nationalist group and various militias who were at risk of being disbanded by force. Basically, the revolutions occurred literally right as it reached the US, making it one of the hardest-hit countries in the spring and summer of 2040. The fallout from the nuclear bombs detonated by the nationalist group and the federal government alike certainly didn't help that."

I don't know exactly how to describe it but there's already a similar thing going on with modern hunters. A lot of them use a combination of modern equipment and technology to make their lives more comfortable, but still, use traditional knowledge and techniques to hunt and survive when on the land. Also, on the topic of building survival in that environment, structures, if left untouched, would most likely stay rather preserved.

Genre: Sci-fi 

Humans were not the only species affected by the warping effects of the HEF-40 Nanobots (originally believed to be some sort of nearly impossible virus). Dolphins as well were affected, treated as a ""secondary intelligence"" by the creators of the nanobots. They developed greater intelligence, as well as gills and the ability to grasp and operate objects with a form of hands. This went unnoticed by Humans and the various other new species generated from them as they had bigger issues to deal with (such as the fact that 50% of the infected population was now dead). The dolphins were unaffected by the death rate, and to humans, it became known that they had been infected, but the increase in intelligence was not known. Dolphin-themed amusement parks such as Sea World at this point have been almost universally closed as of decades ago, and the dolphins have repurposed old human technology and gotten covert help from the nanobots, allowing them to quickly advance (the point of advancement is up for addition)

The first contact between civilizations and realization of the newfound intelligence was in mid-2053, 13 years after the pandemic occurred. Technology is moderately near future, with large amounts of remote-operated technology development occurring as the infected individuals remain infectious, and the only way to go to nonhuman or human countries for either side is via robotic or drone counterpart.  There is no magic, only a godlike extra-dimensional alien race that, for lack of a simpler term, has done this to earth for kicks. They don't reveal themselves until much later. How does the first contact between the land-based sentient species and the sea-based ones play out? Also, what were the reactions of each civilization?"

The reason for the mass death is because of the loss of virtually all basic infrastructure. No water 
filtration or pumping due to lack of electricity means almost no clean water. Loss of trucks built post-1990, most large ships, and planes built post 1960 means no large quantities of food or other sorts of essential goods getting very far. Even the vehicles still able to run are limited by the finite and rapidly decreasing supply of gasoline that would almost entirely expire after 6 months. Lack of electricity leaves fewer options for heating. Important medications almost entirely cease production outside of a few select areas, and hospitals are unable to conduct most treatment due to doctors relying so heavily on computer-aided devices.
