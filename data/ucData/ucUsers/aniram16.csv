ACTrade,fpkohwu,t3_ge0uhh,1588698287.0,I’ve been playing for 6 days and have been dying to find Celeste! Your other offers would obviously help a ton too. This game really has been the best escape as it’s taken my mind off being trapped at home
ACTrade,fpkfqn4,t3_gdthpe,1588693869.0,"I recently discovered the villager Marina and I’m dying to find & buy her. Not only because my name is Marina, but because the more I learn about her the more I realize she’s the addition my island has needed since I started playing 13 years ago! With the rest, I’d probably do a giveaway similar to this."
