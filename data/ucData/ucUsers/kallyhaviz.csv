travel,fpgynlo,t1_fpeasev,1588611850.0,"who books flights 12 months in advance? lol. OP clearly stated ""covid allowing"" and they're asking specifically for general advice about two different potential trips, NOT ""does anyone think I should book tickets?"" Take your doom and gloom ""can't travel until 2030"" nonsense out of here, I'm so sick of comments like this when people are clearly talking about potential, far out trips."
travel,fpgxw29,t1_fpfalzy,1588611466.0,How much is standard to tip them? and do you think it's better to give one porter a sum to split or just tip each person individually?
CoronavirusUS,fpgx47u,t1_fpg2fl2,1588611078.0,yeah you'd think that protecting other people's lives would come first in this case

I think it seems like the verdict is we have to offer alternative accommodations (outside, curbside pickup). I really think she was making it all up though bc she forgot a mask, because I feel like anyone who actually has a condition where they have such a difficult time breathing they cannot have a mask, would be genuinely scared of getting covid and would WANT curbside/ not to be maskless around a bunch of people."

solotravel,fpfjk1g,t1_fpfh2ha,1588573203.0,I second this! It's likely you could individually book transportation for about half the price of the Eurail.
UCSantaBarbara,fpfj1zy,t1_fpf6s4m,1588572760.0,"SO TRUE. cannot stress this enough. KOTO is absolute garbage though. Kamap is 10/10. expensive, but so worth it"

solotravel,fpdda5c,t1_fpazqfg,1588524723.0,"I completely agree with what they said. I'm from the US, and our public transportation is seriously lacking compared to what you're probably used to in Europe. Also, rental cars are insanely expensive. My coworker literally paid $1400 for 2 weeks with a rental. Even if you don't decide to live in the van, you should definitely buy a car if you'll be here for an extended period of time. I'm not sure if it's hard to buy a car if you don't live here, anyone will sell to anyone on Craigslist, but the issue you might run into would be insurance/ the title. Maybe check out like the DMV website"
backpacking,fpdbldp,t1_fpd6aju,1588523770.0,"Actually, I got absolutely destroyed through my blue jeans in Big Sur, Ca as well as all over Italy. The big sur ones were MASSIVE and hurt really bad, the Italy ones were way smaller but equally aggressive.

UCSantaBarbara,fpc42rw,t1_fpbzwp6,1588486930.0,"Your comments are honestly kind of elitist. You're assuming that people who stayed here have safe, accepting, conducive to college studying homes to return to and are choosing not to. Many people, including myself, do not have that or have jobs here. A large majority of IV has gone home, but no, ""everyone except international students"" can't just ""go home."""
UCSantaBarbara,fpc3f9z,t1_fpbznrp,1588486343.0,"The SB county parks website specifically says that “while beaches are open, please do not crowd in areas like stairs, etc”.

You lingering on the staircase makes it difficult for people to maintain social distancing while passing you. Carrying a float or not. So yes, there is an official “rule” in addition to the common sense aspect"

I actually intend to get my MFT, and a counseling degree, and I'm not picky about where I get it from. Part of the reason for this trip is to reach fluency in Spanish and I think that can only help my application. I believe that in certain fields it probably is harmful to take significant time off. But from what I have learned from speaking with professionals in the field, this does not seem to be the case.

Not for advice on whether or not people think traveling will negatively impact grad school / job prospects.

solotravel,fp76j18,t1_fp769s1,1588364956.0,so true! thanks a ton.
solotravel,fp75rad,t1_fp73fiy,1588364557.0,"Thank you! I'm planning on letting my younger brother borrow my car while I'm gone so I will actually have a car when I come back. I've also worked at a few restaurants/ surf schools in the area I'm planning to move back to, so I feel like I'd be able to find a job relatively quickly. Of course better to err on the side of caution with that one. 

5k I agree would definitely would be comfortable, with the current rental market in the area being about $800/month for a room, and I don't have that many bills fortunately.  I'm tempted to set aside as little as $3000, so I can extend the length of my travels but I don't want to come back and be totally broke. 

Thanks for the point on spending money to meet up with friends btw, after being gone for a super long time you're totally right, first thing I'll want to do is go out to eat/ for drinks with friends/ family."

UCSantaBarbara,fp739lx,t1_fp72m0o,1588363251.0,"I agree! The only thing that was nice about the triples though was the diffusion of awkwardness if my roommate had a guy over. Like when I was in a triple in the dorms, if one roommate had a guy sleepover it wasn't that awkward because it wasn't JUST me and them, there was another person. Then sophomore year I was in a double and it became sooo much more uncomfortable if she had a guy sleepover bc it was JUST me, and them. lol."
solotravel,fp6gbdg,t1_fp45zzw,1588351850.0,"Yes, however this was mostly a response to the ehunke's comment saying just because they CAN rent to 18 year olds, doesn't mean they will. The ""adult age"" of 21 really only refers to voting, and running for politics and whatnot in Singapore. The contractual capacity, IS 18 so you can indeed rent hotel rooms and the like."

Ugh I know, I'd love to be there when it's warm but unfortunately I'm taking a gap year between undergrad and grad school so it's looking like winter / fall for this trip. The plus side is I've heard Dubrovnik gets overrun with tourists from cruises in the summer so at least I'll get to see it without all the tourists, even if I'm missing out on nice weather.

I feel like the cutting down a day in Dubrovnik seems to be a general consensus in this thread so I think I might make that change."

solotravel,fowgjgh,t1_fovetfj,1588119342.0,"Thanks for the concern! I've actually done extensive planning, and I know about how much I spend traveling, as I spent all of last summer in Italy.  So I think my budget should be fine- also I should mention I'll be staying with my college roommate for 2 nights and my friend in Athens for another 3 so that cuts down on accommodation costs.

I'm planning on budgeting around $75 USD per day in Western Europe, and $40 per day in Eastern Europe, which is around $4,130. I have a separate budget of $600 for flights/ buses between cities, which puts me at $4,730. I set my budget at $5000 for a cushion for other unexpected costs. As I mentioned in the original post this is the first trip of a year RTW, so I have plenty more $$ saved, in case I go over that, so I have no need to cut a few weeks off this trip. BUT I want my money to last so I'm trying to stick as close to 5k as possible. 

I agree though, if I were ONLY doing this trip, I would definitely give myself at least a thousand dollar cushion."

solotravel,fotgtbs,t1_fos9y8p,1588053504.0,"Wow, thanks so much for such a thought out response! I'm curious, what do you like so much about Mostar? I couldn't find a TON of information online but I was instantly intrigued when I first heard about it, so I'm very interested to hear first hand perspectives!

I should have mentioned, I'm deadset on seeing Nazare, super stoked on it, glad to hear that you agree it's great. Where would you recommend pulling days from to spend more time in Portugal? I'm kind of locked in on the number of days for the trip as it is right now.

Thanks for the advice about Cordoba! I was mostly thinking about Cadiz because of the beach, but I'm not super set on it so I'll definitely look into it. 

I agree, it does seem fast paced. Ugh I tried so hard to slow it down, initially I had Paris in there too, and decided to cut it for that reason precisely (plus the financials). I feel like almost ironically, it is the hardest thing to not just cram everything in there. Luckily, I do feel like the two weeks in Italy will be a bit of a rest period because I'll be staying in the same town, in the same accommodations taking language classes, and not planning on doing any traveling outside the city I'm in -which I'm hoping will make the pace seem a little slower and give me time to breathe!"
solotravel,fotfysj,t1_fotajyd,1588052806.0,"Thank you! If everything goes as according to plan, I will be in Budapest in December, would you still recommend adding more time?"

And you're right it does look like it's on the way to Split so thanks for that insight, good to know that it actually isn't. And I'm not that interested in the war so I think I will make that change to the itinerary:)

Why did you like Mostar so much?

I think I might also be leaning towards Bologna too- I feel like a lot of merchants in Florence would immediately try to speak English to me, and I want to try to get away from that.

Thanks a ton!"

But if you travel for 5 weeks you're at $71 per day, and of course you'll have more per day the less time you travel for.... It seems like with your budget and factoring in the price of the flight you can definitely swing 3 weeks easily, 4 weeks is comfortable, and 5 is probably pushing it.

That could make a big difference depending on how much your flight costs. I'm budgeting about $5000/$5500 for a 10 week backpacking trip in Europe for next year, and last year I spent about $3,500 in Italy for 7 weeks (not including my flight) and was able to eat out quite often and even do a weekend trip to Amsterdam. 

I think a good daily budget is around $45-55 for Eastern Europe, and $60-75 for Western Europe per day!"
UCSantaBarbara,fmq8ufp,t1_fmq0j5t,1586295047.0,"That is actually incorrect. you are eligible for a tuition fee reduction for under 10 units and it is a sliding scale the fewer units you have. However, you do have to petition for it. AND you only lose financial aid if you drop below 12 units before the census date. But if you have 11 units you will lose some financial aid and not get a fee reduction either so I suggest you wait to drop until after the census date if it's still an option (during winter quarter it was January 28th).
