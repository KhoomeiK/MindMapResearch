The part that got me was when he used the words ""unhappy family,"" because most folks with normal, functional families aren't always conscious of the fact that there are people out there who don't have an ideal family life. And these people are now sent back home, where they are still expected to continue perform academically as normal. And him both acknowledging that this is a tough fight and telling us to keep going was uplifting."

Because most of requirements were similar, a lot of my hallmates and I happened to take the same classes, so getting together to study was easy. I know this year they couldn't do it, but they try to do field trips for the LLCs."

Assuming that you're getting a bachelor's degree:
