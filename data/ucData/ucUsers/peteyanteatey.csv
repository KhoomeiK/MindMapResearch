If you live near a really good CC (Santa Monica College for example) I would go there instead and take advantage of the many opportunities that these community college at the cost of 0.00 (CC is free for all first time students for the first two years).

I don’t think think there will be a lot of employers will be looking for only math undergrads for their jobs as well. Unless you have internships and teach yourself a lot of the data science concepts, a math bachelors by itself will not take your very far (if you’re looking for something that isn’t just data entry or sales oriented) I know a lot of people say that a math undergrad is very valuable but a lot of the cooler things that involve math in industry will require some form of a graduate degree. it’s kinda like the coding boom where people who just learned coding could make six figures with just a high school diploma, clearly you can see that isn’t the case anymore. it’s the same thing for math, particularly data science.
