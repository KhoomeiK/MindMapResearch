I'm paying for an off campus apt that I don't even live in while everyone who lived in the dorm got their rent and meal pay refunded. we're all being fucked one way or another, life isn't fair and right it's even more fucked than usual. You can't expect them to fill every single room in the dorms next year. I don't think you realize how fast sicknesses spread in the dorms, every year when it gets around Midterms and finals entire floors get sick.

ucla,fpmq0s9,t3_gduuyk,1588738756.0,"are you talking about ls7B? Only a couple years have had something close to 50% As. You're gonna have to take LS7A first and that's known to be harder, LS7A seems to have more typical distributions where 20ish% of the class gets As. A lot of people take LS7A and realize they don't wanna stick w/ a lifesci major/premed cuz it's definitely a ""different"" type of class. Wait till you get here before you start getting skeptical. I've often found that grade distributions do not correlate to class rigor, except for classes where it's something extreme (e.g. 70%+ As or <5% As). But I've been in classes that w/ 8% As that were much easier than classes w/ 50% As, the grading scheme and detailed reviews give you a better sense of the class' rigor rather than grade dist. imho."
ucla,fpmpacf,t1_fpkt59u,1588738235.0,"yeah but you also have to consider that freshman are new adults, many of them have never had jobs before and overall finding a place off-campus is way more difficult for an 18 y.o vs. a 21 year old.

makinghiphop,fpck6gk,t3_gckp54,1588503603.0,"some assumptions here that kinda tell me you're not fully aware of what's going on in the industry. This is okay, we all obviously learn. 

""Most rappers aren't great, and when you're starting out, that's going to be your target audience. All of the technically gifted rappers are working with producers way above your level. "" 

This isn't true as a whole. technically gifted =/= popularity anymore, and the most popular rappers are not necessarily working w/ the producers that make the best beats. These days it's more about having a brand and connections, guys like Wheezy, Murda, Southside, Jetson, etc. are not necessarily the ""best"" producers per se (tho I love their beats personally), they have amazing brand recognition (people know right away who it is when their tag drops) and they've built a solid network of rappers, A&Rs, and engineers. But most of the ""best"" producers I've seen are guys you've never heard of w/ <10k followers and only a handful (if any) of placements.

Also if we're talking about pure technical skill as a rapper here, most rappers want to pick the right producer for themselves. So in that sense, they'd rather pick someone who simply matches their sound rather than the most talented/skilled producers. Rappers have to be able to see themselves on your beat, that is the most important thing. Also, for those who are the most ""skilled"" and want to show off that skill, they usually go for simple beats. In that case, it's difficult to reason that they'd be using the ""best"" producers.

Regardless, it's good that you found out the fact that making the best beats FOR artists is ideal, rather than just making the best beats period. At the end of the day, a good beat doesn't mean shit if no artist wants to use it."
ucla,fpcbkmt,t1_fpcb7sn,1588494397.0,"yeah i think adding a failing grade to go along w/ the double A system is more reasonable. As far as the argument that this offers an unfair advantage for students in this quarter versus previous/future students, well we're also going thru something that they didn't have to experience while being a student here. Also, plenty of classes last quarter gave everyone 100s or As on final exams, so you can apply the same argument there. All in all, whatever decision is made there's always a camp that suffers, but I'd argue given the circumstances it's better to make extra adjustments for current students going thru the pandemic"

ucla,fpby9yl,t1_fpbvcrh,1588481940.0,"yeah i prefer that too tbh. Tho I may be biased cuz this is my last quarter and essentially all I'm trying to do is maintain by GPA for law school rather than raise it. But b/c I'm going for law, I'm heavily discouraged against using P/NP for most or all of my classes, cuz I'm afraid that'll look bad. Making it mandatory relieves that pressure.

But then you have the other side who say they need this quarter to raise their grades. but when you really look at the situation, who is to say those individuals are even guaranteed to get those good grades? idk, it just seems like we're trying to appease a small minority given the circumstances, as many students are having a hard time adjusting to the new system. Maybe the school can make it so that if you receive an A as your final grade it automatically converts to a LG or something, idk"

AcademicPsychology,fp8he1b,t3_g83muc,1588392350.0,"confirmation bias and a need to feel unique. Problem w/ the internet these days is you can perform research that is totally biased to one side, and it has created a larger sense of polarization. Of course they had biased books back in the day, but before the Internet when you had to do research you were generally required to look into multiple books and different sources to come to your conclusion. Nowadays you can go on youtube channels and sites that are completely biased to one side, and you may not even realize this. 

Personal experience also plays a big role here. If you've been lied to in the past, or betrayed by someone, you're more likely to be skeptical about authority figures, and to assume ulterior motives. But yeah i'd say confirmation bias is the biggest factor, they perform research w/ the conclusion in mind and work backwards, and the internet has allowed us to do that very effortlessly w/o even knowing"
AcademicPsychology,fp8gveo,t3_gb0pql,1588391970.0,"for people who argue against psych being a ""real science"" I often find 2 camps 

One camp consists of uneducated people who have this classic idea of the psychiatrist being this evil guy in a white coat pumping patients w/ Xanax prescriptions cuz he's too lazy to do his work. These people often never went to college, and use movies and Facebook posts to ""research."" Many of these individuals will use the term ""it's all about energy bro"" w/o even fully understanding what energy means. 

the other camp consists of people who have experience in the sciences, particularly in the physical sciences. They cite legitimate concerns, like the use of self-reports and the subjective nature of studying human behavior and emotions in the first place. Also a lot of people studying physics tend to think that all sciences but their own are illegitimate, so their arguments are not exclusively against psychology per se. 

I find that those in the first camp are harder to argue against quite frankly, simply b/c you can't win against those individuals. I forgot who said this, but a popular quote is ""it's difficult to win an argument against an educated person. It's impossible to win against an ignorant one."" I fully agree w/ that notion 

To me the biggest challenge to psychology is operationalizing concepts that are naturally very difficult to quantify. You often may find yourself going into never-ending loops of trying to justify an operationalization of ""happiness"" or ""subjective well-being"", because those in the ""psych is not a real science camp"" can constantly bombard you w/ questions about it"

Of course you can be cheeky and be extra creative in some portions, but the meat of hip hop beats is this repeatability aspect. The rapper has to be able to listen to your beat, and instantly think of some lines to say. He isn't gonna be able to do that if your beat is too complex and has a shit ton of switch-ups and shit. As you make more beats you'll develop the ear for this. Sometimes, you beat may even sound a bit dry but you have to understand that the rapper's voice will ultimately be the main instrument.

chances are slim of course but doesn't hurt to try"
ucla,foxaln8,t1_fox9zk9,1588138369.0,"you should be fine then cuz the average gpa for philosophy majors isn't that high, so if you aced everything else even w/ this C you should be above or at 75th percentile"
ucla,foxaj0u,t1_fowashl,1588138311.0,"everyone who gets into UCLA is admitted as a pre-major. You have to finish some classes to get major status, but the ""applying"" is literally just handing in a form after you have finished the necessary classes (w/ the appropriate grades of course)"
ucla,foxacan,t1_fow71co,1588138163.0,"double majoring in art history and something like bio or physics is gonna be tough cuz those majors are impacted and you're gonna have to do a lot more prereqs. Bio seems more likely cuz if you're taking pre-med reqs than there is some overlap in the lower divs pre-bio majors have to take. Still, it's gonna be a lot of extra classes you have to take if you wanna double-major. If you're going the pre-med route, I'd fully recommend just sticking w/ art-history and just taking pre-med classes. You have a better chance for a higher GPA this way, and you don't have to do all that extra schooling. med schools literally dgaf about your major, and if you can ace all your pre-med reqs as an art hist major you actually might have a tiny advantage cuz your major is a rarity of med school"
ucla,fox9vlh,t1_fox98ap,1588137800.0,"No it's not even impacted. You should be fine, and again worst case scenario you have a very good appeal"
ucla,fox9ssr,t1_fov2ysm,1588137740.0,"do people really care about honors? not even trying to ask in a condescending way but I've never found the appeal to an honors program, unless the honor school is ranked significantly higher (Like in ASU). 

Generally they say CSU tries to prepare you for a career straight out of undergrad whereas UC is more research-focused. But I'd imagine if you're trying to find employment right away, a UCLA biz econ degree will hold significantly more weight than CSUF. Also there are so many business opportunities in Westwood/LA"
ucla,fox9l7g,t1_fovdwiz,1588137578.0,"for your situation, I'd go w/ the prestige since you're likely trying to find employment straight out of undergrad. The department's ranking for undergrad doesn't mean anything, it's only something to be concerned about when you're in grad school. And even then I think UCLA's Anderson is ranked higher? 

Also as a UCLA student whose family lives in irvine, I much prefer Westwood over irvine, and I think it has better business opportunities as well. Don't go w/ the ""I'm not smart thing"", cuz both schools are challenging and full of smart people"
ucla,fox9a3a,t1_fox40i3,1588137341.0,"very hard to quantify this. But UCLA obviously has one of the best hospitals and med schools in the country, and there are other clinics/hospitals nearby. I'd imagine UCLA would have a bit of an edge of UCSD in this regard, but obviously can't say for certain"
ucla,fox961y,t1_fox8kj7,1588137255.0,yeah you can
ucla,fox94au,t1_folw59g,1588137218.0,"UCLA normally doesn't but w/ the current situation a lot of majors are accepting major reqs P/NP. Wouldn't hurt to email them and check 

What's your major? Cuz If you're in something super impacted w/ a high gpa (e.g. comp sci, biz econ) there's a higher chance they can rescind. But generally I don't think they rescind in these situations, as a C is a passing grade after all and even if they do you have a good appeal cuz of the current situation"
ucla,fox8qy3,t1_fowxpb8,1588136931.0,"wow, great insight boss I never realized this"
ucla,fox5an7,t1_fox57ra,1588134422.0,ahh ls7a is always like that tbh
ucla,fox54xm,t1_fox0dp1,1588134309.0,"not the commenter you're replying to me but nah med schools don't care about your major. The only way they'd care is if you have a high gpa and a conventionally tough major in the physical sciences, as physical science pre-meds often have the best MCAT scores. Life-science majors test about the same as social science and humanities. Either way tho, if you're set on pre-med you're better off picking something easier than neuroscience, like maybe psychobio or you can even just major in psych and take the med schools reqs (lots of psych majors do this). Because med schools have pre-reqs, GPA is way more important than rigor of your major, as even if you picked something like musicology, if you aced all your prereqs then that shows you're capable 

the good thing about picking neuro tho is you never know if you're gonna stick w/ pre-med thru college"
ucla,fox49ug,t1_fox47am,1588133717.0,"nah, I heard that midterm was brutal tho and I'd imagine with that class being as big as it is there were probably ppl doing the same"
ucla,fox3j6c,t1_fox20sq,1588133215.0,why do dumbass mfs keep posting on chegg? also was the midterm super easy?
ucla,fox32cu,t1_fox159n,1588132901.0,"my lease is uber fucked. Like an idiot I barely read it cuz I signed w/ the same company, and of course back in July I had no idea this would happen.

But if I break the lease it literally says that not only am I accountable for the rest of rent, but I have to pay for any advertising and cleaning fees to improve the apt if they want to, and I likely will not get my deposit back. Fuck premier student housing"
ucla,fox2x3c,t1_forrk62,1588132802.0,"did your syllabus say that all the readings are fair game as well? 

at this point being a 4th year I kinda know how these psych tests go. Whenever they tell you that everything in the book is fair game, they almost always stick to the lecture material. And when they do pick book stuff it's usually something related to class that was hard to miss in the text

still, I'm a bit worried just cuz we have so much reading and I've never taken Smurda before"
ucla,fowzcy1,t3_ga1k0x,1588130446.0,"tbh not sure if it'll be THAT hard to sublease a spot starting winter quarter, but you'd probably have to ditch your roommates. For me personally I'd do it, the 3k is a lot of money to throw away. Everytime I have to pay rent for a place I don't live in, I feel like part of me is dying. And I still have several months left on this current lease fuck me"
ucla,fowz5cf,t3_ga1kpp,1588130315.0,"lol it's week 5 for one class and I just started watching lectures. Luckily the professor made the upcoming exam next week open-note just the other day, or I would've been royally fucked"
ucla,fowz1ox,t3_ga11sn,1588130249.0,"ehh Idk if that many people will do it tbh. Taking a quarter off can potentially delay a lot of things, I know it would for me if I wasn't graduating this year"
ucla,fowyupn,t3_ga0j8c,1588130132.0,sucks for people who not only paid off-campus for this year but signed a lease for an apt for next year as well. You guys have to literally pay for about half a year of rent for no reason
