UCSantaBarbara,fowsks4,t3_ga00sy,1588126245.0,"Why live alone? I was in a San Joaquin triple and I liked it. Best case scenario you make friends, worst case scenario you just coexist and respect boundaries. Most other transfers are going to be good natured and respectful. They had to work hard to get to this point too."
UCSantaBarbara,foth3tt,t3_g9h660,1588053748.0,"I transferred last year, and overall I like it. The campus itself is honestly kinda mediocre (most buildings were built around 50 years ago), but the location is wonderful. I lived in university-owned apartments and had a great time. I lived with other transfers and everyone was very friendly towards each other. Rent in Isla Vista is not bad for a college town, especially considering the location. I've had no problem getting the classes I need/want, but this hugely depends on your major. If there's anything more specific you'd like to know about just ask"

UCSantaBarbara,fogar88,t1_fofy0pv,1587750179.0,Idk if living in Davis is really much cheaper than Isla Vista. For example my UCSB-owned apartment was less per month than the cheapest UCD-owned apartment. Davis is expensive for being in the Central Valley and Isla Vista is inexpensive for being on the coast. Overall I'd say they are roughly the same.
UCSantaBarbara,fnxjan7,t3_g4htum,1587339808.0,If we go online for fall I'm just going to find something else to do with my life until classes go back to in person and hopefully UCSB lets me be readmitted. I can't do this online stuff for more than a quarter.

UCSantaBarbara,fncsa2d,t3_g0yxru,1586845553.0,"I don't mean this as an insult, but have you considered going to a CA community college and transferring to UCSB? Tuition is free and you can guarantee your admission to UCSB (Look into the TAG program). I know a bunch of people who've done it (including myself), and everyone was glad that they went that route. It's half the price for the same degree."

UCSantaBarbara,fmt48k8,t3_fxajtl,1586366612.0,I was in the same situation as you last year. I liked both campuses but I ultimately picked SB because they had a much bigger and better department for my major. I'd look at what sort of classes each school offers and also try to get in touch with people at both schools to get their thoughts. Either way you'd be at a great school.
