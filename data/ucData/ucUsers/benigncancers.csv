nextfuckinglevel,fpb7ppn,t1_fpax6cc,1588463883.0,Here's the [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/gcenfv/the_perfect_cosplay_doesnt_ex/fpay1mn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that cleared it up for me
Harvard,fpb6vx3,t1_fpal72x,1588463374.0,true enough lol
Harvard,fpacav4,t3_gc6o2z,1588445193.0,This guy thinks he’s Mark Zuckerberg - except without half the talent.
self,fp7gri9,t1_fp7dd78,1588370325.0,Yeah sorry if that wasn't clear - I mean that numbers aren't inherently important but they represent a lot more. Definitely something to be proud of!
self,fp6r6ch,t3_gbmktl,1588357182.0,"HEY that's awesome! GPA is honestly just a number, but it represents all of the hard work that you put into your classes and the long nights you've spent studying for exams, so know we're really proud of you!"
PrequelMemes,fp08563,t3_gaf2we,1588204269.0,"My opinion is that characters shouldn't be brought back from the dead because it cheapens the story, but if they are brought back, do it like Maul (to improve and develop the story) not Palps (to just use as a stupid plot device)."
Harvard,foznyeq,t3_gaaqk5,1588193836.0,"To be honest, I think there unfortunately will be a decease in admissions for the Class of 2025 because a ton of '24s will take gap years and join the c/o '25. While optimally they could still accept the same number of kids, there are limits with dorms and class sizes so they will keep that class at the usual 1600."
Harvard,fov7w7a,t1_fot05ki,1588096822.0,"why join our subreddit if all you're going to do is shit on us for our ""entitlement""? OP said something that is perfectly reasonable and should be implemented in all schools - take your hate somewhere else"
self,fopuw3z,t3_g8qsho,1587972929.0,"VOTE VOTE VOTE
also volunteer for joe if you care and if you have time. he’s not the best candidate but he’s a far step away from this assclown"
UCI,fnxc56m,t3_g4gp2m,1587335657.0,what's the server?
self,fnudjel,t3_g3urtu,1587259709.0,"holy shit that's awesome man

keep it up and don't waste your hard work!"
PrequelMemes,fntl1bu,t3_g3oruc,1587243789.0,"Don't you think that they'll meet again at the finale? Perhaps it's just wishful thinking, but I believe that Anakin and Obi-wan will come to Mandalore to help out and then run off to ""save the chancellor"" in their ships => ep 3"
dune,fne4lmg,t1_fndetuv,1586882960.0,"Agreed. That being said, the response to this movie so far has been WAY more positive than expected. I thought that a lot of people would be complaining about the little details already, but it seems like the subreddit is all behind Villeneuve"
dune,fndcqtl,t1_fnd9tiw,1586866621.0,"yeah agreed, it was a wtf moment for me. that wasn't a quote from denis or anything though, just the author trying to make this relatable"
dune,fndclr6,t1_fndahbo,1586866506.0,"honestly, i kind of liked the glow bc it made the transformation more distinct, but i totally get what you mean by this"
dune,fndcgum,t1_fndamcf,1586866397.0,"i agree with this - i think it's mostly an aesthetic choice for the audience. not complaining at all though, since they look badass"
dune,fndcet6,t1_fndbnsc,1586866348.0,just guessing or is this official?
dune,fndcb09,t3_g13ufq,1586866261.0,good shit.

AskReddit,fn6v6ks,t1_fn6a01f,1586707984.0,yes please! how much would you estimate it costs?
AskReddit,fn61nq6,t1_fn58b1x,1586683928.0,"I'd love to do this, but the equipment seems super expensive. Do you have any experience with it?"
AskReddit,fn54ovy,t1_fn54ll9,1586655852.0,i haven't seen this around before - is it just making bonsai trees with wires?
AskReddit,fn54nxf,t1_fn54l2c,1586655834.0,LMAO do i want to know what this is

Harvard,fm5rii0,t3_ft23w7,1585778515.0,"I thought comping would be difficult, but it's mostly been tedious from my experience. I feel like the clubs make you do a lot of basic work to teach you basic skills, but 80% of clubs aren't competitive at all.

There are some clubs (like consulting, business, finance) that are more competitive, but it's not like their comps are the MCAT or anything. Just put in enough work during the comp process and I'm sure you'll do well!"
