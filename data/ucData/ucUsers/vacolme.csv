UCSD,fpltxp6,t3_ge5i0x,1588719406.0,"Ok i had a similar experience this year, i got an email saying that i qualified for it but when i asked fin aid all the lady told me was “you won’t get it”. Even tho she had no more answers or explanations I just let it go (I’m on the higher end of middle class so it wasn’t as much and i’m already in debt so whatever) and a few weeks later the scholarship appeared on my account. I think they don’t process it until late Fall/ Early winter and it’s more of a federal govt thing than ucsd"
UCSD,fpe2rzv,t3_gcxj93,1588539207.0,"Have a few friends who are living in The Villas of Renaissance and it’s very nice! They have a gym,  multiple pools, parking and it’s about 30 mins from UCSD on bus. It’s near the UTC area. I think it might be less pricey if you rent it with roommates since most apartments and studios have 2-3 bedrooms. I think they have a lot of availability right now because when my friends moved in they were told that many people cancelled their contracts due to online school:-)"
Vent,fotirfu,t1_fothy13,1588055184.0,Thank you!! I hope you’re doing good during the pandemic!!
UCSD,fosz4kq,t3_g96ypb,1588041108.0,I know by ERC’s Ihouse there’s a pump for bike tires. Maybe that’ll help?
UCSD,fofz7p3,t3_g74t2u,1587745388.0,"No. I am having a great time though. Classes are interesting, the people and friends i’ve met are amazing, the campus and location is pretty and the social life and school events(while not as big) is really nice for me and my friends. However, i never saw UCSD as one of my top choices. I really wanted to go to a CSU but because the majority of my class was going to private or UC’s, i felt pressure to not be the only one in a CSU, which now i understand it was complete social pressure and some BS about superiority and feeling “special”. If i had to choose i’d definitely go to a uni that i actually wanted to attend rather than one of my last choices, but ucsd is a great place overall, just make sure it genuinely is somewhere you see yourself at!"
Vent,fo7j88o,t1_fo7fngi,1587579258.0,Omg yes! Someone posted in my college reddit an anime version of our mascot welcoming the class of 2024 and i commented “this is actually really cute” and it was down voted so much??
college,fo24vt8,t3_g4zy7d,1587449807.0,"My parents fortunately understood very easily, but something that changed their perspective was showing them my physical work. I gave them a copy of my class+ schedule and every day i tell them the amount of things i need to read or assignments/ projects i have due every day. It gets annoying sometimes but they learned that i’m not in my laptop all day just for fun and that them adding me extra chores just made me more stressed.

A lot of people seemed to have recommended it here, and i do too!! They also will eventually get tired of you reminding them or explaining them what you’re learning and they’ll leave you alone:-)"
UCSD,fnkaqtc,t3_g25tap,1587020305.0,"I go into Club Penguin and immerse myself into the penguin life. No responsibilities, just walking around with other penguins, playing, spending money and overall vibing in the outdoors"
UCSD,fnkal6n,t3_g28zyj,1587020162.0,"I was feeling great until i realized that the work is never ending. On campus, i had time for myself, mess around with friends and do fun activities. Now i haven’t even touched my hobbies because i am doing lectures, homework and my job from 9am-9pm, literally all day every day. The weekends i’m not even motivated to do anything bc of how tired i am. It’s so frustrating because i feel like as much as i work ahead, i’m always JUST caught up and profs can’t/ won’t do much to help us"
college,fngiex3,t3_g1fs1o,1586933223.0,"Yes! I was talking to it with my boss and he was like “professors are mandated to give the work equivalent to lectures, discussions and homework, so it isn’t a lot more, it’s just distributed different”. Well, on campus I could to all of that plus go out, work out and be lazy.

Now i work 9am-9pm in hopes of “working ahead” but i am never ahead, i am always JUST in time and i don’t procrastinate nor do other non academic activities. I am feeling fine now. But i know in a few weeks i will be burnt out. I hate it and i don’t think the staff realizes it"
UCSD,fncsc8k,t3_g0r57u,1586845608.0,"Southwestern College (Chula Vista, CA) is doing online summer session. Since it’s a cc it’s way cheaper and you won’t have to commute:-) I’m sure other cc’s probably closer to home are also online. Same as ucsd’s summer session but a cheaper option!"
sandiego,fncs6i1,t3_g0ztpf,1586845463.0,"Thank you very much for this! It hurts to see our neighbors suffer due to the lack of government action. My friend’s uncle died and he was a doctor in TJ. It is hitting close to home for many San Diegans.

UCSD,fn5uunu,t3_fzqi0x,1586676692.0,"Many people have given you the general answer, but the majority of the student population is really nice and welcoming. There are not a lot of brown and black people, but those fee stick together, specially in places like the resource centers. I (am not black) went to a black resource center event and all the students were super super nice! Even when i was very obviously not part of their social or ethnic group, they made me feel welcomed, made me laugh and taught me a few things. So, if you decide to come to ucsd, even thought there are few black students, the have a very strong and close community that will welcome you with open arms :-)))))"

UCSD,fm5zul7,t1_fm4tfn4,1585783343.0,"Hey! The sections times don’t matter anymore! You can have any prof, any discussion time because everything will be online and at your own availability:-) Vitkus still has a few spots in webreg, so I recommend you enroll in those! You’ll get the same as if you were in A19"
