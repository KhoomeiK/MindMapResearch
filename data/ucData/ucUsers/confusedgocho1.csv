UCSantaBarbara,fpisyh6,t1_fpipn3x,1588648008.0,How are the labs for 126 A-B? They looking intimidating just cuz of their sheer length
UCSantaBarbara,fpbuunu,t1_fpbrxf3,1588479313.0,Yeah dont you just love how we get penalized if one of out attempts is incorrect. Love that for us. Ochem is a bitch
UCSantaBarbara,fp7aeqr,t3_gbq5vi,1588366946.0,It looks so nice! It always looked so gloomy and depressing heading to my classes in the morning and having to see the entire gated up area.
UCSantaBarbara,fp5avon,t3_gbe7cp,1588322497.0,"1b isn’t really hard its just very math heavy. Like you are gonna be doing alot of calculating. If you stay on top of the class and DO BOOK PROBLEMS, i cant stress that enough, you’ll be fine."
UCSantaBarbara,fowhw24,t1_fow8r5a,1588120097.0,My orientation leader last year told me to take a econ class as GE since I couldn’t find anything else with space. Im a fucking bio major. Worse advice i have ever got.
UCSantaBarbara,foqk3l9,t3_g8vf28,1587995330.0,Congratulations your in! And you will definitely be granted the major change request since you are still staying in the college of L&S. I did the same but switched from chem to bio.
UCSantaBarbara,foohxlb,t1_foodfrh,1587939297.0,No yeah im not to surprised. Me and most of my friends got like right around the average
UCSantaBarbara,fodwxv3,t3_g6yf3v,1587691693.0,You are literally asking to get rammed. You are taking the dreaded winter quarter for second year bio majors and taking it to a whole other level.
