I didn't tell my age to my classmates, was super insecure about it (in MechEng we have a lot of mature army vet transfers), but eventually I came clean to some of my classmates at 2 in the morning while doing homework together and they thought I was super cool and we are still friends to this day :)

Just be yourself and enjoy the ride, go Bears!!!"

One of the most famous professors in EECS (our top ranked department), Claire Tomlin, is a Waterloo grad! From what I've heard from friends who work at various tech companies in the bay, Waterloo kids are always in high demand cos of their coop experiences and the MIT of the north reputation. Some great professors in my department did their PhDs at top US universities and hey they decided to be a professor at Waterloo cos it's a great place to do research."
