ucla,fpiyoug,t1_fpi296m,1588651926.0,"I look over the UCLA thread daily and I've never seen anyone spewing hate speech here. Sure there were some bigots from USAC and general students making ridiculous claims for both sides, but nothing from the people you claim. If anything some of the folks who support USAC were the ones making idiotic posts claiming anyone who votes against the bill is a racist. Btw, my friends and I voted against this USAC fee increase to save money. Go ahead call me racist or whatnot, everyone is entitled to an opinion ;)"
ucla,fpixnsy,t1_fpishha,1588651183.0,"It is $15 per quarter, therefore $45 for the year. Nice try, but I'm going to vote NO to anything that increases fees. If there was a vote for the sports fees I would do the same."
ucla,fpix53e,t1_fpioa2c,1588650814.0,Gotta get rid of the trash somehow Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
ucla,fphyk12,t1_fpgy44h,1588630199.0,"Cool, so from what I'm understanding vote for someone else besides Aniq"
ucla,fphy2mo,t3_gdkfxq,1588629937.0,Comes to show how pathetically desperate they are. Make sure to let them know (if your ok with it) that you voted for none of them :)
ucla,fphq95j,t3_gdjy6y,1588625821.0,No idea. The best response would just be to just vote \[NO\] for the referendum
ucla,fphpxag,t3_gd6c0j,1588625652.0,Just wanted to share that I voted against the $C$U$B$ referenda. USAC come at me
ucla,fphojws,t1_fphm3qo,1588624933.0,Same. I can't vote \[YES\] to the $C$U$B$ swindling too
ucla,fphodj3,t3_gdhuos,1588624843.0,"Ah, I see now. The correct voting option for $C$U$B$ is to vote \[NO\]. Never cared for what $C$U$B$ was for, but I am not wasting money for nothing and so should every student on this campus."
legostarwars,fpepapz,t1_fpdr11u,1588552058.0,Very nice dude. You should advertise your model to prevent people from getting ripped off lol
legostarwars,fpep6kk,t1_fpe99na,1588551989.0,"No. Also, he didn't design that, in fact, he didn't design any of the models (the designer is David Buchholz). And it's dead obvious that his model is a simple recolor of the set."
ucla,fpbq5cq,t3_gcisow,1588475952.0,"If we have the option for online, then I think I'd just stay home unless I have to dorm to have a place to stay for Winter and Spring (if I can get a spot on the Hill). I'm not really that outgoing or active to be at school. And not having to pay for housing is a great burden to not have as well."
ucla,fpbpjeb,t1_fpbm6jj,1588475519.0,"Ah ok, that makes more sense, my bad. I misinterpreted the post to being ""20% of voters saying \[YES\] to pass"". I still hope our votes will make a difference at least."
ucla,fpbigo0,t3_gchpwa,1588470762.0,Why wasn't it supposed to be 50% from the beginning? The fact that it's not means it IS rigged. Isn't the point of voting supposed to be a way to see what the majority of people want? What's the point of having a vote when it is already one-sided from the beginning?
legostarwars,fp6lcwm,t3_gbj778,1588354319.0,"Nice! Obviously better than the LEGO one (even if it was UCS this would be far better still), I hope a lot of parts from the new AT-AT can be used in this one lol"
legostarwars,fp413nb,t1_fp3xtjh,1588289622.0,Definitely. The legs need to be thicker by around 1-3 studs to look better and accurate. At least the figures are really good.
legostarwars,fp3zmu4,t3_gb6hxr,1588288816.0,"Figs are great, but the build not so much. The legs are too skinny and the main guns are short. Honestly, LEGO hasn't been able to make an AT-AT better than the 4483 AT-AT from 2003. I hope this has good pieces to use for better AT-AT MOC's"
ucla,fp17upg,t3_gapr22,1588226907.0,"No need to read the picture folks, USAC shill post."
ucla,foyywni,t1_foxuz5u,1588181744.0,"Nice try, but this COB is still not getting my money and support :P"
legostarwars,foe2dlp,t1_fody370,1587694676.0,"Sounds like a good plan, but whenever you do I'd recommend the dropship to put with the AT-TE or the AT-AP (coming soon)"
legostarwars,fodx9gj,t3_g6xs71,1587691869.0,"Nice, I'm going to build mine tomorrow whenever I have time! Any plans for building other ones as well?"
ucla,fo3qf7y,t1_fo1knh7,1587491257.0,Sucks being revealed huh?
legostarwars,fnpjitp,t1_fnockm1,1587146594.0,"Eh saying it's incredibly accurate is an overstatement and so is saying its completely inaccurate. If you want actual hyper accuracy then look at MOC builds. UCS sets, in general, are accurate but lack finer details and usually captures the general shaping."
legostarwars,fnpinqg,t1_fnnftax,1587146168.0,Exactly. It'll have to be around 18cm in length for minifig scale.
legostarwars,fnpi8pc,t1_fnn5a4v,1587145963.0,I get that. That's why I usually make the MOC versions of a lot of ships/vehicles that are around minifig scale. The thing with UCS sets is that have they are not made with a certain scale and a lot of them don't scale with each other.
legostarwars,fnphuin,t1_fnopxzx,1587145768.0,"Well for a ship that small and at the scale Jerac made, it's obviously unnecessary to use 1000+ pieces."
legostarwars,fnn3vsg,t1_fnmrp29,1587083848.0,US Price: $199.99
legostarwars,fnn3tgn,t1_fnmyaex,1587083810.0,Hey just because you don't like minifig scale stuff doesn't mean it's sacrilegious because liking minifig scale and/or big UCS scale is a stylistic preference. If you like it more power to you dude!
legostarwars,fnn3ln9,t1_fnmx9bo,1587083680.0,"I can assure you his A-Wing is very **good**. It's really sturdy, detailed, and uses some fun techniques too."
legostarwars,fnn3fxc,t1_fnmqr86,1587083584.0,"You should check out MOC's by Jerac or Inthert. Lots of there MOC's are minifig scale, have just as good or better detail than UCS sets, and are quite sturdy (especially Jerac's)"
legostarwars,fnn38wz,t1_fnmmpq7,1587083467.0,"I agree. I don't get why people expect UCS sets to be minifig scale, especially for a ship small as the A-Wing. Sure I prefer minifig scale stuff, but just because a UCS set is not scaled doesn't mean its bad."
legostarwars,fnmuuwk,t1_fnmp9mv,1587078601.0,"That is true and Brickvault claiming ""perfect"" minifig scale is quite misleading, there is no true minifig scale because of the disproportionality of the minifigure to humans. For me at least, I don't mind if it's a bit too large/small as long as I have a well-proportioned model with accurate detail."
legostarwars,fnmtupn,t1_fnmo2y5,1587078053.0,"Interesting, but either way it's still an incredible MOC that we won't get from LEGO."
lego,fnmfus5,t1_fnm9qah,1587070675.0,Thanks! It's roughly close to scale. The Nebulon is a bit too big to be scaled with the UCS ISD.
legostarwars,fnmbbzc,t1_fnm9n9d,1587068361.0,"Not really. LEGO doesn't have a ""standard"" scale and just make sets that are big enough to play with that won't completely break down. There are only a few sets that LEGO actually made minifig scale like the UCS Falcon or Slave I."
legostarwars,fnm4b4q,t3_g2l8j7,1587064852.0,"Interesting how LEGO is starting to utilize the 18+ age recommendation more now. This set is an easy pass. I got an amazing minifig scale A-Wing MOC by Jerac, no need for this."
ucla,fnicch3,t3_g1xxup,1586977600.0,"If you guys are radically pro-black, as you supposedly claim, then why not allocate the extra millions of dollars you stole from students for the black community? Quit making conspiracy style claims and make proper arguments for why we should give more money to USAC."
ucla,fngiciw,t1_fngf772,1586933161.0,That has to be one of the most ignorant and false claims I have ever read.
ucla,fnghi9j,t1_fng5l3j,1586932403.0,Are you serious? What a bunch of swindlers...
lego,fnen5zm,t3_g1c10k,1586892344.0,The one on the way left is my reverse engineered attempt on 2mpaireds tantive and the other two are slightly modified ones from LEGO sets.
lego,fnem2dr,t1_fndp9x1,1586891786.0,Too spooky for LEGO ðŸ‘»
legostarwars,fneb2n1,t1_fncw1qa,1586886187.0,"It's too small for minifig scale. Check out these other minifig scale Turbo tanks. But either way, this needs to be bigger to be considered minifig scale. Its a good UCS scale though.

lego,fnct2sy,t3_g0ip0u,1586846296.0,Happy birthday man and enjoy the build! For my late bday I'm gonna build an AT-TE MOC by David Buchholz since I finished my 19k piece ISD a bit too early haha.
legostarwars,fncsspv,t3_g10f1c,1586846036.0,The Tantive IV on the very left is my reverse-engineered version of the Tantive IV by 2mpaired. The other two are slightly modified ones from LEGO sets.
lego,fncskeh,t3_g0vgaf,1586845823.0,"Hot dang, forget being set for quarantine, your set for the rest of the year lol. For me, I've been building other builders MOC's lately and most of it is waiting for parts to come. But the MOC's are far better than most LEGO sets. Built a 19k piece ISD, so much better than the UCS ISD in every way asides from the price but I spent close to the UCS MF price for it. Either way, I still need to get that Pirate Bay haha. Have fun building"
legostarwars,fncbkon,t3_g0ik3s,1586832859.0,"Nice, but brickpukes Juggernaut is quite far off from being minifig scale, which shows really how big the turbo tank was in the movie. There is a builder who was able to make it close to proper minifig scale on flickr and has 15k pieces with two levels of interior. Anyhow good luck on your project dude!"
ucla,fn5mn4x,t3_fzpo51,1586669098.0,"Your right, I would rather spend more money on drinks for friends than have it go ""missing"". Great so were now at a point where if I don't give money I'm racist? Looks like I've been a racist my whole life guys. I'm sorry."
ucla,fn5hof2,t3_fzfnjv,1586665141.0,"Ugh I feel you, my TA's had an asinine idea to force my class to make a group video for each of our homeworks. And it's only for one freaken question and groups are randomly assigned by RNG. Like first of all, that is one of the worst ideas for ""group work"" and just obviously unnecessary. What was wrong with doing homework regularly?... (Yes I am quite salty about this, but it was a pretty absurd idea I think)"
ucla,fn29noi,t1_fn1a79w,1586581825.0,"""Think about this"", ""think about that"", blah blah chitty chit chat. Do you really think using religious groups, transfers, and other minority groups as a reason for the USAC's actions? We already waste around $200 for USAC to ""mismanage"" it. And I'm certain the $9 million dollars is MORE than enough to getting everything well supported while giving every USAC member a fair pay. Learn budgeting or some form of financial planning, it'll do wonders.

Also, it's very pathetic to beg for votes for a friend by one's personal view of them. Why not list accomplishments that person did, unless they did nothing..."
ucla,fn0h6qd,t1_fn0ekzk,1586541867.0,Apparently we vote through myUCLA. Idk where in myUCLA though :/
ucla,fn0gn97,t3_fyjyls,1586541584.0,You know its really funny how a Reddit post seems to have offended the entire USAC folks. I like it!
ucla,fn0fww1,t1_fmyxki7,1586541202.0,"Oh, it'd be great if I was that so-called privileged, too bad I'm not. Not sure if you can tell the difference here, but I actually get something in return when I pay my taxes. Unfortunately for you (and USAC), I don't get anything in return, which means I spend money for nothing. And I'm pretty sure there are A LOT of students who get nothing from your precious corpora.. err association. Sure call me cheap, but I'd rather spend money on something I get a return on."
ucla,fmytjwj,t1_fmx7qtf,1586495330.0,You should make another post to remind us to vote a couple of days before the vote
ucla,fmytgh8,t1_fmyiv79,1586495248.0,"I can honestly care less about where this money goes to. All I care about is that I have to waste more money on something I haven't even heard or cared about until now. And don't think I say this because ""USAC is full of \[insert insult\]"" if I had to pay more for tuition or housing for whatever reason I will still react the same. But the one difference here is that USAC folks seem to be overly sensitive over a Reddit post."
ucla,fmysrtu,t1_fmyhxry,1586494667.0,Correction: Future politicians.
ucla,fmyspya,t1_fmyas7s,1586494623.0,"And if you read the response of your friend here, they made no reasonable counter-arguments and rather made childish comments about OP. I respected your comment above but looking at how you seem to ridicule other users for not wanting to agree with this cash-grab, it seems everyone in USAC are the same."
legostarwars,fmyr1vm,t3_fy3mlt,1586493248.0,That would be absolutely great to get. I'm pretty certain it will not be in the UCS Gunship because it makes no sense to have them there and getting them in a battlepack is just ridiculous (those are the worst/lamest battlepacks). I think they would be in a $50-$100+ set assuming LEGO would put all four in one set.
ucla,fmy77xb,t1_fmxudt9,1586479616.0,Sure stealing our money is definitely something not shameful.
ucla,fmxvkix,t3_fy298p,1586472728.0,"Sorry, but what's the USAC? You know for $15 dollars I can go to In n Out and get a good meal there. Actually in fact, if I didn't waste $200 for some self-proclaimed organization, I could buy school supplies and/or buy a good amount of food."
ucla,fmxu75s,t3_fxy4rl,1586471948.0,"Yah even if I actually got $200 worth of service rather than nothing, I still would never waste more money for a program that didn't seem to exist. Heck, I would rather not give them any money at all."
ucla,fmxssg1,t1_fmxqj21,1586471171.0,"Your arguments remind me of certain political debate. Anyways, why don't you give some reasons to why we students (whom the majority are not rich) should have to spend an extra amount of money AGAIN for something I didn't even know existed. Either way, I don't care what ""good-willed"" resources this program does, I've paid more than enough money for school."
lego,fmr8bld,t1_fmqwmp8,1586316280.0,Sort of like half and half. The interior parts where you can't see I just used real bricks since the color won't matter and most of the exterior I did on [Stud.io](https://Stud.io) to buy the pieces on BL. Also a lot of experimentation on certain parts to get the shape or connection to be strong.
lego,fmqwivt,t1_fmqgh5k,1586308592.0,"Thanks! I guess I just winged it haha. Dan has quite a few pictures of his progress designing and making the Pave Hawk on IG, which helped out a lot. The exterior is pretty similar, but much of the interior was guesswork."
lego,fmgyw71,t3_fv6aox,1586061633.0,"I see you're making Cavegods AT-AT. I recommend having someone help hold the body up when attaching the legs for an easier process haha ;) 

Best of luck!"
