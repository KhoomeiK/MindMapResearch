As for the others, I think they just don’t see me that way."

Example:

Complimenting their choice of shirt? Nice. 

Complimenting each part of their outfit and how nice their bone structure is? 
Not as nice"

The entire story you explore alongside your partner, you go through trials and struggles and exploring new places. But at the end...ugh, when you sacrifice yourself in order to restore the Temporal Tower...yeah that made me cry

Like the music is so heartwrenching and just seeing the ending be you and your partner that you’ve been playing alongside this whole time have to say goodby forever is just...sad. Like you read their thoughts as they realize their best friend is fading from existence...ugh

Yeah I cried when I played that game. Hearing the soundtrack still tugs at my heartstrings"

AskWomen,fmabfcl,t3_fu0yen,1585888898.0,"I always bring a first aid kit and wipes with me. First aid kit was real nice, I felt like a wizard pulling it out whenever my friends needed a band aid. The wipes have less of a thrill though, but it’s always fun to watch people be surprised that I’m super prepared. 

As for super super useless...I keep pressed and like dried four leaf clovers in my bag. I like to think they give me a lot of luck :)"
