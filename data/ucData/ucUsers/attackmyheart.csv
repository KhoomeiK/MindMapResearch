ucla,fn101i4,t1_fn0zixw,1586552090.0,oh that's totally fair i'm just responding to those that talk about student government not doing shit there is DEFINITELY misappropriation of money
ucla,fn0z4hh,t3_fyoclz,1586551580.0,"yknow what would happen if there were no more usac fees or usac? clubs wouldn't get funding, there would be no enormous activities fair, no bruin bash, no guest speakers,  laundry costs on the hill would be crazy, and the list goes on and on and on"
ucla,fmxmph8,t1_fmxm74o,1586467875.0,but... from what i've gotten from db articles is that they have no way of getting that 2m bc it's a different entity that uses it. and i'm pretty sure they never found out where it went so like... i don't think they can do that
ucla,fmxjql1,t1_fmxjl6b,1586466283.0,also i didn't realize that wanting a black student resource center + spaces for marginalized communities on campus was a bad thing? if you're going to say usac wants to raise fees at least say what they're for
ucla,fmxjl6b,t3_fxy4rl,1586466203.0,wait i'm confused?? i read the referendum and one of them is allowing the redistribution center to get more funding which... i didn't realize is a bad thing....?  and it's 33 cents...??
