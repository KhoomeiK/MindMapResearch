Not only are you home, where not everyone around you is mutually pursuing the same goal (a mfing degree) but you don't go to a certain room at a certain time to a certain seat on certain days to learn about a subject with likeminded people. The interface switch is hard as it is! Focus on what you can do right now in 5 minutes. Set a timer. Build up your tolerance(: take breaks because your daily schedule no longer provides them w/ zoom uni. And because you're allowed to take breaks. 


I feel you. There's no one answer and we're all out here doing our best, with varying degrees of success and varying difficulties. I'm sure you are doing your best! 


One thing that helped me is i finally got a lock for my childhood bedroom ðŸ‘Œ i'm sure there are small things in your environment that can be shifted, removed, or added to support the work getting done, you may not have found them yet is all."

In MMW 122 I recommend the easy writer unless you're proficient in MLA format or have another up to date MLA manual. 

History of World Societies is also optional IF you do group study or internet reading on the time period the prof specified. If you like to study alone, you should have it from MMW 121 anyway so just keep it and use it.

I don't know who you're taking but IF there's a reader for your MMW: get it. And more importantly read it. Getting through the class without it will shoot your grades down a notch. Personal connection to the material will help strengthen your memory in what is not a rote, but associative memory based course.
Hope that helps."
