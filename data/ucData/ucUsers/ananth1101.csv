As other posters have said, top companies related to finance/banking, economics, IR, business (which are mostly consulting careers) hire exclusively from a few elite schools. For people with these majors, this can mean the difference between getting a job, and your starting salary (read: difference between $70k and $150k salary). However, for STEM, your major is based on skill."

That UCM, UCR, and UCSB use non-holistic and point based essays and their emphases can be found on [askmssun.com](https://askmssun.com) and college essay reading rubrics from the UCs themselves. Try googling UCSC's admission rubric:  [https://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cafa-committee-on-admissions-and-financial-aid/cafa-admissions/Holistic%20Review%202015%20FINAL.pdf](https://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cafa-committee-on-admissions-and-financial-aid/cafa-admissions/Holistic%20Review%202015%20FINAL.pdf) .
