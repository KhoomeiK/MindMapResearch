Don’t disturb me in my reverie  
Go back to the party

Let me sit here with my drink

UCSC,forc6je,t1_fora4p9,1588009747.0,Even reaching the point in the conversation where I am explaining this is something I’d rather avoid. Too much of a hiccup when I’m just chatting with a stranger

Economic interests may force politicians to open the world up prematurely, and it's likely infections will spike again and we'll have to start distancing over. I think this is gonna be around for a long time.

oldfreefolk,fnf2gxt,t1_fncyq4t,1586900191.0,"It's appalling. I think their philosophy in making these mistakes is that a large TV audience wants big action sequences and clever taglines, not high fantasy or abstract lore. In trying to create what they thought people wanted, they lost sight of what ASOIAF is, and what the show already was. There's hardly anything left of this series without the history, folklore, and magic of its world. Brushing those things aside because ""who cares,"" because the crowds are hyped and we can't let them down, is how the showrunners dug their graves."

It’s inactive now, but it’s a proof of a concept for what could be a cool sub. The idea is to create and share transcripts of conversations from real life. Originally it was intended as a study tool for writers, but I think it’s fascinating for anyone curious about the dynamics of conversation and the variances in people’s mannerisms."

Now is a good time to eat healthier, too. Quarantine restricts the freedom to move from place to place and interact face to face. These are huge ingredients for feeling energetic, happy, and relaxed. Quarantine has been getting me into a slump too but looking out for my health in other ways has kept me going"
