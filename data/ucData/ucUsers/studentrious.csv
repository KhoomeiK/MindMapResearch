UCSD,fpitjwk,t3_gd74pf,1588648392.0,My biggest obstacle to caring about showing up and maintaining friendships is literally that: showing up. Parking is actually a nightmare and i’ve given up to the point where I only take classes that don’t require attendence and if they do I only show up occassionally so I can still maintain an A. I shouldn’t have to give myself a grade handicap because UCSD is grossly negligent about commuter life.

UCSD,fpb8hbl,t3_gcaa40,1588464361.0,I prefer it. A paper once every 1.5-3 weeks for 10 weeks is more annoying to keep up on than a paper every 1-2 weeks for 5 weeks. weeks weeks weeks weeks
UCSD,fp5nzow,t1_fp4fxau,1588335607.0,It’s worse than any business. Businesses would get sued into the ground if they tried this. Payments made for services not rendered is fraud/extortion if you’re not apart of the aristocracy.

Is there a more immoral financial act than squeezing financially poor students in the midst of a pandemic? I mean what absolute scumbags. I’m lucky enough to not be of that demographic either. Just a witness here. Imagine not even being able to make your car payment but getting extorted by your university for a gym that might aswell not exist?

I’m not an anti-institution type of guy either. This kind of shit is exactly what’s wrong with our country. Gigantic institutions waiting to be sued for their immoral acts rather than not commit the act in the first place."

UCSD,fp0c2oz,t1_foy7rrb,1588206395.0,You simply reiterated what you already said. The NY stats suck because if 20% of NY has it the disease does not warrant lock down as we're impeding herd immunity more than we are stopping CV19 entirely (which would be completely and utterly impossible to stop if 20% of NY has it). Looking at CFR is the wrong stat in that context.

UCSD,foxzpi9,t3_ga5c63,1588161493.0,"This guy has never heard of overreporting or comorbidities. A CV19 death is counted regardless of comorbidity status (die with a heart attack, revived cia cpr, catch cv19 in hospital, die next day, counted as a cv19 death because test is positive).

UCSD,fo6juun,t1_fo65neh,1587560607.0,"I have no idea and that’s why I feel like there’s so much thats being hidden from us. 

I think the testing hysteria is incoherent. If we don’t have a cure or good treatment what use is it other than to congregate people at testing centers and spread the disease more? 

The response does not meet the actual data. There’s likely to be a similar number of suicides as the global death count due to unemployment and this house arrest we’re all under. Especially in poor countries where unemployment = death/starvation since there’s no bailout money to be had. 

If you do the research on unemployment and suicides you’ll see what i’m saying isn’t as crazy as it sounds.

It kinda feels like there was a Wuhan strain with a much much higher CFR.

UCSD,fo63gaw,t1_fo5y231,1587545071.0,"There’s a weird brand of anti-intellectualism in media. It’s not outright populism though. It’s more of a ‘only our selected experts are credible’. 

Some of the studies on HCQ have been purposefully constructed to fail. One didn’t even include Zinc which is like air dropping a bomb with a grenade payload, another administered it to a small sample with many complicating and obfuscated comorbidities and mediciations. 

There’s something weird going on but it’s not apparent exactly what. I think it’ll all be overridden and forgotten when states open back up. It feels like there’s so much we don’t know about the virus (such as if it was made in a lab, why/how 1%> cfr? Footage from Wuhan from January and December was much worse)."

Turns out the Scythians of ~500BC were some hardcore motherfuckers. Had practices including but not limited to: Quivers made out of defeated enemies skinned arms including the hand and fingernails. When their kings would die they would kill and then taxidermize 50 of his best horses in a running position, kill a few of his wives, kill and then mount 50 of his attendants/slaves onto the taxidermized horses in a circle around his grave.

The Getai (same time period) had a practice where they would sacrifice people to go speak to their god. They would sacrifice them by throwing them onto 3 spears and if it only maimed them without killing them it was considered the sacrificed individuals fault and they were cursed and a coward then they were exiled.

This is borderline unintelligible. Please stop deflecting. Skepticism or critiques of the quality of China's exports has been grounded in evidence for decades, on top of the existing evidence from recent events. The rest of your comment is unfounded and unsourced deflection. Equating a test with 70% accuracy rate (which you don't even cite likely because it's not true) with completely faulty ones is at minimum intellectually dishonest.
