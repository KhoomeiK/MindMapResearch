Even if we argue that she doesn’t fit the rectangle, keep in mind this is about most common body types, key word here being common. Uncommon body types still exist. 

And true, we can halve that 420 billion genetic variations to be 210 billion genetic variations, but that is still a gargantuan number that even I can’t wrap my head around. I mean, there’s plenty of guys out there that have what people perceive to be “feminine” characteristics; what’s stopping the opposite from being true?"
Gamingcirclejerk,fpib5bb,t1_fpi8ygm,1588637305.0,"I mean, there’s ass loads of phenotypes that women can possess that determines how their shoulders and torso appear. You’d be surprised to know that women don’t all have the “pear-shape”/“hourglass” body types that I’m guessing you expect out of all women; some can possess the torso/shoulder build that are similar to men as well. There’s 420 billion genetic variations possible in the human race alone, so a woman that looks like the character in TLoU2 isn’t exactly a surprise."

ucla,fmyqqpz,t1_fmxqj21,1586492998.0,"Honestly, I’d rather put stock in a guy that admits to cheating on a math test and whacking his pickle off (seriously, what even in the fuck was the point of putting that second quote in there?) than 2-bit wannabe politicians with superiority complexes that guilt trips a member of the community, in a passive-aggressive manner no less, because said member called out their lack of transparency."
