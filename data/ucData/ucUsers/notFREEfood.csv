Right now you're telling me that issues with law enforcement in areas that have millions in population are just isolated incidents?  What about all of the incidents involving the NYPD?  What about the Chicago PD?

Maybe you've been blessed by having saintly police, but those of us who grew up with corrupt cops don't see it that way.

If you share the general area where you live I'm certain I can come up with police misconduct near you.

Now those incidents clearly don't speak for all law enforcement, but that's exactly why the fucking ""thin blue line"" is bullshit that needs to be stamped out.  The ""thin blue line"" creates an us vs them mentality that leads people like me to not expect cops to do the right thing.  An otherwise honest cop that comes to the defense of a dishonest cop is no better than the dishonest cop he defends to me because his defense may allow that crook to keep abusing people under the color of authority.

There is zero proof Zoom has acted maliciously, and saying that they have to be serving the CCP because their CEO is Chinese is racist.

That FBI warning?  It's about people getting their meetings interrupted by malicious third-parties.  This happens because the meeting organizer didn't secure the meeting.  The AG of NY suing Zoom?  That is over them leaking data due to a facebook connector.

And the Chinese companies?  They're subsidiaries of Zoom, and Zoom says they own them wholly.  Zoom also has 2500 employees in the main company, more than its Chinese subsidiaries.  When I point out that other companies also use China for development work, it isn't whataboutism; it's pointing out that this practice isn't uncommon.  And because these companies haven't had noticeable issues with these development practices, Zoom sharing them isn't de-facto bad.

As I said earlier, I work for a federal contractor.  We use Zoom.  Our cybersecurity group's stance is that they know of no reason to even evaluate alternatives to Zoom."

Google has made forays into the Chinese market, though it hasn't had a sustained presence there.

Zoom is first and foremost a US-based company bound by US laws and beholden to US investors.  What you're suggesting Zoom is doing is highly illegal.  Now that's not proof they're not doing it, but it's strong evidence against them doing it.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  If Zoom were sending data to China for the sake of interception, it likely would put them in breach of contract with all of their corporate clients.    This also contradicts official statements, so they would be violating false advertising laws.  It also may result in investors suing for a breach of fiduciary duty as no business would use a system that they knew was sending data to a third party.

The only ""evidence"" for data exfiltration is that the client talked to servers in China though.  But if Zoom truly was a covert front for the Chinese government, this would have been a monumental fuckup and should never have passed review - it's easily detectable.  If Zoom were truly interested in doing this, they would just have their servers silently make copies of your data.  You can't have a company be simultaneously competent enough to hide a conspiracy where thousands of workers in the US are working for China and incompetent enough to allow idiotic exfiltration schemes.

Crypto AG is the counterpoint to Zoom not being a front for China, but Crypto AG was privately held (making ownership much easier to conceal) and an order of magnitude smaller (making the conspiracy easier to hide).  The signs pointing to Crypto AG being compromised also weren't that the machines were talking to others unexpectedly, but that encrypted messages using their machines seemed to be known too easily."
networking,for90vb,t3_g943ox,1588008227.0,"Hire a MSP that knows how to set up wireless networks.  Unless you aren't going for full coverage, 1 AP per 25,000 ft^2 is extremely sparse.  Your devices may be having issues because they can't get a strong enough signal.

Beyond that, I'm surprised I didn't see you mention a firewall at all either.  Manufacturing equipment needs to be behind a firewall, period, and that's assuming it can't live on an airgapped network.

My guess is that your ISP router has a single /24 configured on it though and things aren't working because you are running out of IPs.  Again, you should be talking to a MSP because flat networks are a security risk."

Can't answer the first part, but sharing passwords via plaintext is generally discouraged.  Email is especially bad because it may be transmitted in plaintext if the mail server doesn't support encryption, and even then it lives in plaintext on the mail server.  Your alternative option isn't really much better however as text messages have the same fundamental flaw of being plaintext.  The best way to share these would be for the company to give you a public key that you can then use to encrypt a file containing the account data.  That said, they should absolutely be changing any password that you know, and so it wouldn't be bad to send them via an app that provides end to end encryption (provided that you emphasize the passwords should be changed)."
