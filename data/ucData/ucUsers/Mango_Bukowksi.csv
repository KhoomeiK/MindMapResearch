23andme,fpe3uio,t3_gcjxbv,1588539808.0,I came back to read the rest of the comments on this thread. I posted here earlier with a book recommendation. All i'd like to say now is that I would like to send extra kudos to you for handling with intelligence and grace all the bigots who showed up here. I wish you good health and fortune!

23andme,fpc3ode,t1_fpbtuw0,1588486571.0,"Thats awesome. If you are ever interested in learning about some African History, I would like to recommend you this book called The Civilizations of Africa: A History to 1800 by Christopher Ehret. Its very good stuff. Kudos!"
23andme,fpbxefd,t1_fpantg9,1588481251.0,Do you think you can share the sources of information you mention about those Spanish settlements and Ottoman slaves in the Appalachias in the last 400 years? I'd like to learn more about what you're saying here.
ucla,fpbm72m,t3_gchpwa,1588473248.0,Its a very curious thing that the people who will fuck around with our money in the future get their practice in real early.
LosAngeles,fpag8rz,t1_fpafuml,1588447532.0,"That is true. Just yesterday, some reporter from the LA Times interviewed a few of these people who were shouting outside City Hall with their MAGA merchandise, and some of these people said that they were from places as far as Huntington Beach and Lancaster."
LosAngeles,fpaaejt,t3_gca1le,1588444076.0,"Some of these people, perhaps most of them, don't live within LA city limits. In this picture they seem to be on a bridge just nearby City Hall and the Court Houses. I'll bet you serious money that you would likely never see these shameless faces walking the streets of Downtown LA, or have any business to do there for that matter on a regular day."
LosAngeles,fpa9n3n,t1_fp9siik,1588443625.0,That man spent as much time with his sign as he did with developing his ideas.

These people are up to no-good."
ucla,fp3u32q,t3_gb4akm,1588285822.0,I just want to say that you have a cool name. That is all.

23andme,fn8ysu4,t1_fn8yjhz,1586754013.0,"Hey man. I said I agree to disagree, it is a step in conflict resolution. If you'd like to continue to disagree with me, bicker by yourself and I suggest that you don't continue this conversation especially by offending the length and breadth of my historical understanding. That goes for any conversation really. If you are genuinely interested in continuing this conversation respectfully, than I ask you to source me the history of south asian servants in New Spain. 

As for the question of the posters heritage, I have only made suggestions. You are asserting things. I think the former is more responsible than the latter."
23andme,fn8y0p3,t1_fn8xvxk,1586753368.0,I agree to disagree.
23andme,fn8xafz,t1_fn8x09o,1586752773.0,"Well there is no amount of confidence that can prove what you say without stronger evidence. Jalisco, Mexico does not even have a coastline on the Carribean to begin with. If you can explain how english speaking south Asian servants made their way to New Spain, by all means. Also, i am suggesting that her Romani heritage, if there be any at all, might be very distant. Perhaps it is not attributed to recent immigration from the late 19th to 20th century, but perhaps earlier given that it was not uncommon for the Spain to deport romanis to the Americas in the colonial period."
23andme,fn8wo22,t1_fn8wak6,1586752275.0,"Oh, well i saw that she had recent ancestry from Jalisco, Mexico. I think that was part of the Spanish Empire. Its not uncommon for a lot of results from Mexico and South America to have this central and south asian ancestry, including mine. I dont see how it could have been south asian servants brought by the British --- or perhaps im missing a major historical fact which is odd since i am a student of history myself. Perhaps so."
23andme,fn8kaie,t1_fn82yzi,1586743579.0,The Central and South Asian is probably Romani? Think gypsy. Lots immigrated to Latin America. What years does the timeline date this part of your DNA?
23andme,fn44aze,t1_fn3vumu,1586633773.0,Perhaps one of his ancestors who is native American and Spanish was from the U.S. southwest before it was annexed by the U.S. from Mexico. Just a thought.
