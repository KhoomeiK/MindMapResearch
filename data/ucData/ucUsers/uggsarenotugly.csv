As a former IA and student who has experience in failing classes through the drop w/o W deadline, I will say this: you cannot do more of what you have been doing in a class and expect that to work. You have to actually change your behavior. Doing more of the same thing that hasn’t allowed you to be successful won’t help. I do not mean for this to sound condescending at all, OP, because trust me, I have had professors come chasing after me to start passing their classes. Oftentimes, it has nothing to do with you not being capable/smart enough. Sometimes, it’s just the wrong approach, and some classes (maybe like this one you’re struggling in) don’t give students much room to make mistakes. You may need time to reflect on your progress and why you are not where you want to be in that course.

I think that dropping the course now will save you stress moving forward this quarter. If I were a grad school admissions officer, I would be impressed to see those wonderful letter grades you earned SP20. You’d be saving yourself 6 weeks of stress AND an undetermined amount of stress that could ensue from a NP. The harsh reality is that poor letter grades and NP will still be scrutinized despite current pandemic circumstances. You would likely have to explain the NP. 

I hope this helps. Always remember to do what’s best for you and that your opinion matters the most. Keep powering through the quarter, I’m proud of you and the efforts you’ve made in your classes."

I decided to hop on the bandwagon and take 5 classes (letter grade for med school purposes) this quarter. can anyone else relate to me? I feel like I'm behind my peers bc everyone else seems to have so much more time to study and I feel like that's just not the case for me. I feel like I'm at a disadvantage and really need some motivation, thank you."
