food,fp9ry96,t1_fp9niac,1588433298.0,"Mayonnaise is a magical ingredient. It makes the outside of your grilled cheese extra crispy, your chocolate cake extra moist, and your tuna/chicken/potato salad sing. That being said, not all mayonnaises are created equal. Sure, you’ve got your standard Hellmann’s, your Duke’s, your avocado- and olive oil-based fares. But in the gastronomical kingdom of mayonnaise, only one reigns supreme -- and its name is Kewpie.

You may have seen Kewpie mayo before. It has a distinctive baby for a logo (lifted from the works of cartoonist Rosie O’Neill) and comes in a spectacular soft-squeeze bottle. It’s the creamy concoction you slather on your okonomiyaki, squeeze onto your temaki sushi, and dip your karaage -- Japanese-style fried chicken -- in. It looks more yellow, and dare I say, golden, than your average mayonnaise and it has a much creamier and luxurious consistency.

Kewpie mayonnaise -- which was invented in 1924 -- is now a household staple in Japan."

At the beginning of this decade Earth was almost under siege from Visitors not from this planet.  Especially in the US.  The media was perched to investigate the phenomenon and make it household news.   But those dark secret forces we’ve all come to know changed everything.   Instead of UFO facts, we were given UFO parody.   I also think this was the time when those dark agents realized they were not dealing with just one or 2 species of Alien visitors.  Imagine disclosing to the circa 1950 Earth population that multitudes of Alien beings were invading our space with impunity and that we had no way of communicating with them AND the Aliens were not communicating with us on a global level.  Scary stuff!"
