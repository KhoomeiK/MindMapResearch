superman,fnjzubm,t3_g25idj,1587011026.0,Cavill was never accepted because his origin ends with him abandoning what the movie was preaching. His dead space dad AI gave all this dramatic exposition about how he was destined to do great things and how every single person has the fundamental capacity for good and how that would lead humanity to follow him into the sun or whatever. But then movies central conflict ends with him proving the villains right. He accepts the villains terms of “defeat” and then executed on those terms (literally). Why in the world would anyone trust this guy’s leadership? He can try to preach be good to others all he wants but when the chips were down he abandoned his sacred morals that he supposedly wants everyone to live up to. How is humanity supposed to join him in the sun when that sun is a lie? That just ain’t Superman to me.

I also do agree I want a more idealistic and less uptight Batman. One of the co-writers of the script is a huge fan of TAS so there's a small chance we might see that bleed into the movie itself."
