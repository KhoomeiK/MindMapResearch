EDIT: I apologize for my ignorance I just saw the comments and realize they haven’t been called “murder hornets” until a few days ago by the news"

memes,fp76fda,t1_fp70id1,1588364904.0,"Oh well when I said I just use my thumb I never look down I can search with left thumb without looking and work on the test with my write hand so it doesn’t look like I’m doing anything. Although I’ve only cheated when the prof is unreasonable. When i did this it was for a stats class and the prof gave us 80 mins for 50 questions half were free response problems and he didn’t give us the Z-value chart, said “you should be able to figure out the z-values without a chart.” Like yes but on a timed exam and real life application why would someone deprive you of a calculator and tell you to figure it out in your head?"
memes,fp6yyxa,t1_fp6wnn3,1588361055.0,I have thicc thighs so I keep my phone between them while im taking a test and I learned how to search things up with just my thumb. To everyone else it just looks like my hand is resting on my lap or I’m scratching an itch.

AskReddit,fom0tdt,t1_fom0hsh,1587875253.0,"I think I hated hearing, “The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal” as much as the test itself."

UCI,fn7xssl,t1_fn7q7qy,1586729787.0,"Yup college apartments and dorms aren’t really that spacious. Although to be fair I’ve seen friends hanging out together as well, but whenever they come across others they maintain the 6 feet distance. I guess what I’m trying to say is, if you stayed on campus and have a friend you’re always with I don’t think the risk of contagion would be any different than being at home with your family who most people don’t keep 6 feet from. Especially since in both cases you’d have to eventually go out for food or water."

UCI,fn11ld7,t1_fn0wv5r,1586552967.0,"Ya I’m not too sure about the cap, but if you’re planning on double majoring then make sure you don’t finish one major let’s say your 3rd year and focus 4th year on the second. The reason is because financial aid will only help you until you have a bachelors so you won’t receive aid your 4th except from outside scholarships. At least this is what the advisor told me when they saw I was double majoring so I’m leaving 1 class left for one of my majors for later."
