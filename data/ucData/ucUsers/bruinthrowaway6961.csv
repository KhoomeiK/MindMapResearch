ucla,fpezha7,t3_gd2snf,1588558317.0,I am so so sorry. This is a very difficult situation and there's no other way around it. Remember you have permission to grieve through emotions... What you feel right now is perfectly valid and reasonable. I wish nothing but the best for you and your family.
ucla,fos44np,t3_g97l42,1588023628.0,"This video needs to go viral. There's so much good in this man and everything he said. Education in general is so focused on assessment that we compromise our learning for the sake of just getting a good grade. Formal education has lost the thing that made it so valuable. Even outside of COVID-19, this has been such a fundamental flaw in education.

Grading schemes that are high-stakes for having 1-2 exams or projects count for a vast majority of the grade are incredibly toxic to students. And then colleges sit there and wonder why mental health in schools are so bad and why most students hate school. It's literally sitting right in front of them. I've taken several classes at UCLA that have this grading scale. We are human and sometimes we have off-days. Especially at UCLA on the quarter system, it's so unforgiving to the point where if you fail a midterm you can basically say goodbye to any chance of getting an A and have to claw your way back up to even get a B. And then if you talk about it to a professor, it's \*YOUR\* fault for \*NOT\* working \*HARD ENOUGH\* to get a good grade the first time.

Taking an assessment of learning shouldn't ever be scary. It should be informative in letting us know how much we know, and where we can improve and grow in our knowledge. If education is about learning, then why does it care so much about assigning us a ""grade"" that carries with it value? We just get letters on a piece of paper that we use to assess our self-worth (the fault of our society valuing the result over the process, ingrained in us at a young age.) And we keep doing that until we get our degree, another piece of paper, that gives us value somehow. Something needs to change, and this professor sees it."

I know people that got into both, people that got into one but not the other, etc. It's very heavily dependent on the program you're applying to (the schools may be more selective for the programs you applied to).

Edit: You'll just have to wait a little longer to find out the answer for sure!"
ucla,fo8ytmr,t3_g64b9o,1587606738.0,"I remember when I received my transfer acceptance in 2018 and how excited and nervous I was!! Good luck to you guys. And just know this: Don't let the institution define you. That goes for if you don't get in, and even if you do get in. You can find success REGARDLESS of where you are :) It is up to you and only you!"
ucla,fo63m0r,t3_g5wkgc,1587545241.0,"Yeah no you have every right to be stressed and upset about this. Your emotions are completely 100% valid. I've always thought that the out of state tuition, particularly for international students, was absolutely insane and just overall ridiculous. But especially now, when we're in a pandemic and our classes have been moved online via Zoom? Anybody trying to say that we get the same quality of education we would get if we were in person is deluding themselves (and no students seem to be saying that anyways.) You have a great point..."
ucla,fjuyoh0,t1_fjuybm1,1583621527.0,ok you have a point
