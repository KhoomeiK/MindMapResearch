headphones,fpfdwkh,t1_fpf256l,1588568412.0,">If you think that I'm a ""gatekeeper"" and that what I am saying is ""bullshit"". Then you are a fake audiophile. You are what will eventually destroy proper mastering technique, and create products that are obscured form the real empirical objectives.

This is honestly hilarious. The irony of this comment just writes itself. A perfect example of gatekeeping.

>What I am saying is that until you have heard your favorite music on a pair of loudspeakers... you don't know what the differences are between headphones outside of their very limited scope of constraints. Because... You have not referenced the ""reference"" if that makes sense.

This is where your logic died. If you can hear the difference in the sound of the same track across a range of different headphones then you will eventually be able to characterize the differences in tonality between them and classify their sound based on that.

Therefore, hearing that track through a loudspeaker is irrelevant for 2 reasons:

1. Headphones will never share the same characteristics of speakers, and to compare them as such is foolish.
2. Loudspeakers, like headphones, also each have their own unique tonality, so it's impossible to use one as a universal reference.

>This is the true meaning of ""reference"". You are trying to create equipment that can be an accurate reference to the musicians original performance

I'd also argue that this notion is irrelevant as well due to the digitization of music production. Artists have much more freedom to place instruments and sources wherever they want within the soundstage, and many modern artists, outside of EDM, do this. Plus, like you said, headphones will never be able to do an accurate forward image anyways. So why would I compare the capabilities of a headphone to the capabilities of a loudspeaker? There are also things that headphones can do much more accurately than loudspeakers. It wouldn't be fair for me to judge a loudspeaker based on the performance of a headphone in many regards as well.

>If thats how you feel, You are no friend of a real audiophile and you should just FUCK RIGHT OFF

This part was just cute. You are welcome for spending the time to correct you. ðŸ˜˜"
HeadphoneAdvice,fpbsuzg,t3_gcg5v8,1588477862.0,"Sound signature is basically talking about the personality of the headphone. So all sounds that humans can hear are divided into three ""categories""(bass, treble, and midrange). You seem to already know what bass is, so I'll skip that. Midrange is mostly made up of vocals, so like the singers voice. Upper midrange is usually female vocals. Lower mids are usually male vocals. Treble are the high pitched sounds like bells and that kind of stuff. Sound signature refers to how the headphones represent each of these categories. Warm headphones, for example, tend to have elevated bass and midrange. Bright headphones have really high treble. Dark headphones have elevated bass and reduced mids and highs. Mid centric headphones usually push vocals more."

headphones,fpag61r,t3_gcbso9,1588447486.0,"Imma be real honest with you. To me this just sounds like more gatekeeping bullshit that audiophiles like to do. It's just more of that perceived superiority crap and false equivalences that people in this community just love to throw at eachother. It's stupid and it's pointless. What's the point in going onto a sub based on peoples love for headphones, and then shitting all over their preferences? 

Each hardware format produces sound in a different way. They each represent music differently depending on their individual characteristics. Therefore you can critique each based on its characteristics within its category using whatever music you have.

At the end of the day this is all about enjoying music. Telling people that they aren't allowed to enjoy their music and critique their platforms based on that music unless they've heard it through a loudspeaker is ignorant and pointless. It's the same elitist mentality that gives audiophiles such a horrible reputation to the outside world.

Moral of the story: let people enjoy what they like, and stop gatekeeping what's correct and what isn't.

HeadphoneAdvice,fp935pk,t3_gbsqit,1588412519.0,"I want to point out that there is a huge difference between the volume of bass and the quality of bass. Planars are known to produce high quality bass, but they tend to not produce a lot of it. Dynamics can more easily produce bass but not at the same level of quality. It's hard to get good quality bass and high volumes unless you pay a premium for it. 

It sounds like you care more about volume than quality. For that reason I'd recommend you save yourself some money and buy the Philips X2HR. They have the perfect sound signature for EDM, and you won't be sacrificing much quality with them.

The m1060s have better quality bass than the 58x, but the 58x actually produces louder bass. The m1060s are the better headphones in terms of sound quality, but that doesn't sound like your primary concern. The X2HR has higher bass volume than the other two, and it isn't very far behind in terms of clarity and detail.

Personally I think you'd enjoy the X2HR much more than the m1060s."

Switching to lossless streaming or playback may help a bit. So would getting an external dac/amp. As the others said though, it's likely mostly because the shp9500s are much more bass lite.

You could certainly go for a cheaper amp and spend more on the headphones if you want. I personally use an Aune x7s that I got for $100 used.

I'm not super experienced with headphones in that price range so ill let other people give you suggestions on that.
