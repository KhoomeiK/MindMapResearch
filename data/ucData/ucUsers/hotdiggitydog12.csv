UCSD,fpm8ru6,t3_ge9a8w,1588727886.0,"I was answering multiple-choice questions like in 20 seconds each at the end.  I wasn't even reading all the answer options, does anybody know how much the grade it gave us immediately was out of?  This was my second midterm today and 3rd one this quarter and honestly they have all been like this.  I haven't had one where I feel like I had enough time to answer all the questions all quarter.  I'm hoping I did okay on this one though all things considered."

UCSD,fma2ih2,t3_ftza7m,1585882210.0,saaammmeee!! So much better honestly. I'm taking an extra class this semester cuz I have all this extra time that I would have spent commuting.  So much less stress.
