Otherwise I would just move to a new place whenever the chance comes. A new place means new adventures, new experiences, new people. 

I found my life partner and have been living together for 8 years in total. We married last to years because we were confident we are together for the long run. 

We didn‚Äôt want kids because we didn‚Äôt feel ready. However, I had grandiose career ambitions that led us to move to states every 2-3 years. 

At the end, she wanted to stay close to her family and aging parents. I wanted to continuing pursuing my career goals.
