InlandEmpire,fpm03xg,t3_ge8v7p,1588722844.0,"Someone post this on the FB riverside page, yeesh those peeps"
ucr,fplence,t3_ge2qmd,1588711349.0,"Thanks, needed this. 

Currently living by myself while all my friends were able to go back home to their families. I know a lot of them have troubles with the families but I get jealous that they get to at least be in the vicinity of people. The isolation has brought back so many bad/sad flashbacks to times I rather let go of. Whenever I try to focus the silence/lack of eople around me just brings the memories back. 

I know my situation is lucky tho, trying to keep my head up. Hope everyone else can too"

InlandEmpire,fp7kjet,t3_gbjhmq,1588372357.0,"Can someone help me understand why Riverside is like this? Full of idiots like this? I'm from the bay (not to say there are no idiots, there's a ton too) but down here they seem to be more of the majority/louder. I've heard SB isn't like this as much?"
Riverside,fp063cs,t1_fp059zf,1588203181.0,People on the riverside county Facebook definitely have their heads in the sand about this whole thing.

sociology,fodwc1e,t3_g5pjfe,1587691364.0,How did you turn your grades around? I have extremely poor grades right now (2.89) and the idea of an academic career has popped into my head. I'm still somewhat early into my path but we're inching towards the halfway point.
