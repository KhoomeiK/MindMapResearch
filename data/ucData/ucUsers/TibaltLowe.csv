Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fpn3zb4,t3_gedzps,1588749465.0,I was laid off on March 15th so I’ve been at home almost two months now. With all of this time on my hands I’ve picked up making terrariums and mixology/bartending. I’m typically passing the time playing video games or Netflix. I cannot wait to be able to go bouldering again when this is over.

history,fpmewn5,t3_gdyamp,1588731572.0,"Let’s take a look at this from a historical perspective.

Time was not standardized until the late 1800’s. Electricity wasn’t standardized until around the same time, or maybe a bit later.

Life before the alarm clock was just that, life. People were acclimated to what was expected and the norm. Priorities and expectations were different. The natural human “alarm clock” had been waking people up at their “programmed time” for ages by this point.

With this in mind, let’s remind ourselves of the general day-to-day lives of the masses before alarm clocks:
Long grueling hours working farms, mines, lumber mills, etc. you wake at the crack of dawn, work until the sun goes down, and do it all again the next day. A reliance on candle light meant night life for the average person didn’t usually include staying up very late. Priorities were different too. It was a matter of survival to get to work to provide for your family. 

From the outside looking in, this may not seem relevant, but I assure you the more you consider these points, the more they factor into this long-winded historical perspective into waking up before alarm clocks."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fpmczu4,t3_geaa24,1588730395.0,"Money goes a lot further when you’re buying fresh Whole Foods as opposed to processed/frozen foods. Vegetables, fruits, beans, rice, chicken, oats, yogurt, etc are a good starting point. 

Breakfast: 
1.) oatmeal and/or yogurt with fruit.
2.) Eggs with beans, tortillas, or toast. 

Lunch: 
1.) chili with crackers
2.) spaghetti with meat marinara or Alfredo sauce

Dinner:
1.) chicken with rice and broccoli
2.) chicken fajitas - tacos or bowls

There are endless combinations just find what you like, is easy, and affordable."

Significant financial set back is people like me growing up to divorced parents living on food stamps and government aid not knowing when your next meal will be.

It’s being embarrassed pulling up to school in a crappy beat up piece of crap car and being bullied for it. It’s the uncertainty of whether your power is going to be shut off this month.
