ucla,fozs5v1,t1_fozn3ja,1588195922.0,"I didnt sign it fortunately, as i would've paid for a summer place that i wouldn't live in at all. Luckily my family lives in OC, about 50 mins from campus.

 I figured that if worst comes to worst, i would just end up commuting for the fall, and since it seems like at least some classes will be online, the commute shouldn't be as bad."

ucla,fohkbwe,t1_fohcb8f,1587767392.0,"Lease starts in July, so I'd have no need to be there until the quarter starts in late September. Im probably gonna send an email tomorrow detailing all my concerns, I just don't see why I should drop 4,000 dollars rn, especially when it would just be for the first 3 months, when I'm not even going to be living there.

I think the negatives outweigh the positives here, since I assume I can always go looking for a place later on? Hopefully its not too hard.

Just wish UCLA would say smth already, thanks for the long response, i really appreciate it"
