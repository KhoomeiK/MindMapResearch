UCDavis,fpl137a,t3_gdppgh,1588704514.0,"The question we should be answering is what exactly do you use your computer for. A lot of people buy expensive Macbooks just to type word documents. I have an hp because Macs may not be compatible with some of the engineering software I use. My advice would be to think about what type of programs you'll need to run for your major and also, get something light. You don't wanna lug a heavy machine while riding your bike everyday, trust me."
UCDavis,fpl07d3,t1_fpj7kha,1588704076.0,It's pretty spot on from my experience. It just doesn't matter though because usually only one professor teaches a certain class per quarter so bad professors are unavoidable

AskEngineers,foxfx5p,t1_foxfaj6,1588142772.0,"Tbh you could probably do it 2 years then. I didn't take Calc 2 and mechanics until my 2nd year at community college. But since transferring depends heavily on GPA, maybe spreading out over 3 years is better so you don't overwhelm yourself"
UCDavis,foxflgm,t3_ga053m,1588142489.0,"I don't wanna sound harsh but I wouldn't recommend biomedical engineering unless you plan on further education after undergrad. The reason is that biomedical engineering goes through a lot of different topics, without going into a lot of depth. For example, you'll take basic mechanical and electrical engineering classes, but not enough to really know it compared to ME/EE engineers. Just my 2 cents, don't take it as an absolute truth"

AskEngineers,foxeu45,t3_g9ypdq,1588141840.0,It took me 3 years and that's very common. It also depends on how much math you already know.
California,foxdmw1,t1_fox9ynt,1588140838.0,"My point is that it's futile trying to hold our government accountable. Our government is corrupt and there is practically nothing we can do about it. The fact is, Americans are willing to put their own health on the line to pay bills and put food on the table. It's unfortunate, but it's our reality"

nba,foi6znf,t1_fohz8ye,1587780024.0,"I would argue Klay's 3&D style was influential. A 2nd option scorer who shoots 3s and plays defense is sought by so many teams. It's why Lakers went to get Danny Green, and Rockets got robert Covington, even though they're not as good as Klay"
