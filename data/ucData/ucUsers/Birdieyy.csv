UCSantaBarbara,fopuegl,t1_fopp8s0,1587972461.0,">That's a shitty situation for sure. If you're on a 50% contract and spending more than 20 hours a week on TAing then you in theory have a course of action you can take to address this with the course instructor/department/union/ombudsman etc. You're under no contractual obligation to do anything outside that contract regardless of the current shit storm, and the department should draft someone else in to help. I also recommend talking to the instructor and other TAs in your department about how to mitigate common issues ahead of time so that you don't have to deal with them. Easier said than done sure but it's useful to hear about strategies other people use. If you're having trouble with classes, say something to the powers that be, and/or get other people to say something too. There's power in numbers.

Second this. If you are TAing over 20 hours a week go to our union! You can either have the hours reduced or get paid more. santabarbara@uaw2865.org"

UCSantaBarbara,fnnwllb,t1_fnnurcq,1587103996.0,I think its higher for grad students in my experience.
UCSantaBarbara,fnkcged,t3_g27usl,1587021962.0,My understanding is the USSA fell apart twoish years ago. The fee is currently used by the EVPSA and Lobby Corps to fund lobby trips. Its kinda deceptive how its being advertised in this election.
