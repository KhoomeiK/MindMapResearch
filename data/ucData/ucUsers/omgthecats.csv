It feels so shitty that I’ve sacrificed so much (hanging out with friends, visiting family, having a good night’s sleep, I even quit my job so that I can focus on school and spent almost all of my savings) just for this to happen. It’s so unfair. I’ve tried bringing this up to my professors, different departments, and even one of the deans and people have actually responded saying it’s way too early for me to be complaining and I’m probably exaggerating. “You’re a good student, I’m sure you’ll be fine” or refer me to counseling. NO. I’m telling you I’m NOT fine because I’m being overwhelmed with the amount of work I’m being assigned and the lack of actual teaching and tutoring. REALLY makes me feel supported by the school. I feel so angry about the whole situation and start crying whenever I think about it..."

UnsentLetters,fp6htcb,t1_fp6enl3,1588352584.0,"I agree with this. The last time I was truly in love was a few years ago (I was pretty young in my defense) and when I realized just how strongly I felt about this person, I completely withdrew. I’ve experienced SO much loss in my life and being that vulnerable, allowing myself to lose someone again, was too scary. I feared of going back to the dark place I had barely gotten out of. I can agree that means I’m not ready to be in love but I don’t think that means I don’t DESERVE love. That’s a bit of a stretch. A painful one lol especially because I used to struggle with the thought that I don’t deserve love."

offmychest,fob2b1p,t3_g6jrn7,1587655329.0,"I think people who are claiming you shouldn’t be together is a bit harsh. That may be true but only the two of you know, not anyone on here. Every relationship has its hardships, unfaithfulness being a common one, and they would never last if we didn’t work through these hardships. We are only humans. We make mistakes. Sometimes huge ones. As long as it isn’t a pattern and he doesn’t repeat himself, and you are otherwise happy in your relationship, then you should definitely continue with how you are and rebuild your relationship. However, if you find that this is negatively affecting your mental health long-term, then you may want to consider working through it with your husband and/or getting a divorce. Regardless maybe seeing a therapist will help because it sounds like you are being really hard on yourself. If it’s any consolation, I don’t think what you did makes you a terrible person at all. You made a huge sacrifice and did what was best for all of you and I think it took a lot of strength to do that. If anything, I’ve gathered that you are a very brave, logical, and considerate person from this post and an amazing partner. I wish you good luck :) <3"

UCSantaBarbara,foai0mz,t3_g04tzv,1587646881.0,"Not gonna lie, it’s ROUGH especially if you’re not used to the quarter system. My advice: spread out the more difficult weeder classes, take physics at SBCC over summer (transfers directly and the professors are amazing vs. I hear the physics series at UCSB is pure torture), take ochem with Lewis and go to CLAS every. damn. week."
UCSantaBarbara,foahkk1,t3_g6ei8o,1587646631.0,Honestly call the police when you see this. I know everyone hates to be a snitch but there’s a huge consequence to letting this happen. IV is such a small place so the coronavirus would spread quickly. Not to mention that there is a retirement home in IV AND in general there’s a ton of older people in SB and Goleta. So upsetting to hear that so many people in IV are this ignorant and selfish... I want to say that they’ll get what’s coming to them but I feel bad for everyone else who will be affected...

Hair,fo30zo9,t1_fo2mt5n,1587478453.0,"I mean technically if you use any dye, you don’t get the same precise color every time. It depends on how you apply it and the hair color you’re applying it on. The thing is oVertone advertises that as long as your hair is light blonde and you follow their directions, your hair will become one specific color (or close to it) and you have to reapply their “dye” ~weekly and buy their other dye-infused products to keep up the color. But my hair barely picked up any of the dye despite using so much so many times and for so long AND it turned a completely different color. I feel like they should refund me for that but like I said, they won’t get back to me no matter how many times I reach out to them :/"
UCSantaBarbara,fnylu4u,t1_fnwd1l3,1587367179.0,THIS HAPPENED TO ME TOO! I ended up having to miss a quiz because of this! There are only 2 optometrists. Was she white or asian? The white woman is Heather Nichols (everyone is complaining about her and she was the one who didn't tell me I was having my eyes dilated) and the asian woman is Corinne Chick.

offmychest,fnfrdhr,t3_g16zbh,1586913873.0,I totally understand! I recently tried to “fix” my sleeping schedule so that I would wake up around 8-9 AM because I thought it would make me more productive and BULL SHIT! I got so little done during that entire week! I decided to let myself have a “cheat day” and stay up late and I finished over half of the things I needed to do for the rest of the week! Definitely going back to my natural sleep schedule and not letting anyone tell me otherwise! :)
relationships,fnfpibo,t3_g1gj2a,1586912762.0,"This sounds like a really tough situation for everyone involved. I can’t imagine how betrayed you must feel. You should definitely take some time to yourself to accept the situation, allow your emotions to settle, and decide what your next steps are. It is always better to calm down before dealing with a stressful situation. A few things to consider are: 

1) Although it hurts a lot that his family didn’t tell you and lied when you asked why your husband stormed off, it wasn’t their place to do otherwise. Many of them probably did want to tell you but they did not want to damage their relationship with your husband, maybe they were told not to, they didn’t want to break up your family, etc. There are plenty of reasons and you may never find out what those reasons are. Ultimately, your husband was the only person who should have told you.

2) Obviously your husband made the wrong decision but remember that he initially made that decision when he was just a child (probably scared, not very knowledgeable or mature, perhaps his parents did not allow him to be involved, etc). Perhaps he believed in abortion before and does not now, for example. He could have wanted to reach back into his son’s life but felt like it was too late to do so or felt like it wasn’t his place to do so years later. Maybe he just didn’t know how to begin that process. Maybe emotionally it was better to pretend it just didn’t happen (remember the mind will do crazy things to preserve your sanity and survive). Also, remember that you do not know who this woman is or what she was like when they were 16. Of course, none of this is okay and I’m not trying to justify it or place any blame on the woman, it is especially unfair to the woman and his son, but I’m just trying to *understand* what could’ve been going on in his 16 year-old mind that caused him to do so... Obviously it does take an emotional toll on him if he ran out and got completely wasted. Perhaps he exploded when you asked about the woman as a defense mechanism (a poor, immature one but we all make mistakes). He could regret his decision and feel really guilty about it, he could be scared about how this will affect your family, etc. However, he proves not to care about this other woman or his son, I’d say goodbye to him! 

Like I said, there is a lot to consider about why things played out the way they did but more importantly, there is a lot to consider about how you want to move forward. Although this must be especially difficult for you because of your beliefs, how you decide to handle things will affect your entire family. Your husband made a huge mistake but maybe he wants to make things right and you can help him do so. Maybe he could see a therapist about this, you could help him ease back into his son’s life and develop a relationship with him. Every relationship is about support and it sounds like this may be the thing he needs the most support with. It is completely understandable if you choose not to, but it would also make sense to stick by him for the sake of your marriage and your family. Everyone makes mistakes and a lot of people make huge ones like your husband did. Emotions can completely screw logic and rationality and cause you to do some stupid shit (some people more than others). What matters is what he chooses to do now. Also, I’m not trying to say this is all on you, your husband will definitely have to put in a lot of work to gain your trust back and make it up to everyone. If he is not willing to put in the work, if he does not show any compassion or remorse, then it’s good riddance to him. This is such a tough position to be in and I wish you the best of luck! <3

Edit: Again, I’m not trying to say how your husband has dealt with the situation is okay and I’m not trying to make excuses for him — I’m just trying to understand why he could’ve behaved that way. And I’m not trying to ignore how much this affects the other woman or his son, this is completely unfair to them and I can’t imagine how much they’ve struggled as a result of his decision. But you can’t change the past. You can only change your future. Let’s just hope your husband wants to make things right and everything works out for everyone involved in this terrible situation."

trashy,fnaxbp6,t3_g0h8kx,1586805470.0,But did you call the cops?
relationships,fn8a425,t3_fzz0db,1586737130.0,"Okay, I feel like a lot of people here are being harsh. Everyone has their flaws and it looks like your boyfriend’s is that he does not take care of himself. This usually stems from having a low sense of self worth, depression or other mental illnesses, or maybe even having parents who didn’t take care of themselves so you never learned how to. Recently losing friends will definitely make that type of behavior worse... Many therapists are having their sessions over FaceTime during the pandemic so he should definitely look into that. 
In general though, you should definitely encourage your romantic partner to work on their flaws but you can’t force them to be a different person. It can be frustrating for you and feel rejecting for your partner. A part of being in a long-term relationship is learning to accept these flaws and loving them regardless of these flaws. But like everyone else is saying, you’re only 23 (so am I actually lol) — You’re supposed to enjoy your life and freedom, find yourself, etc, not take care of another person but it’s totally up to you. It sounds like you just need to take a little time to yourself to think about whether or not you want to be with this person long-term. I will say, loving and being with someone who is mentally ill can be difficult at times. It takes a lot of patience and understanding and it can often have an impact on your mental health as well... But many people do it. It’s your decision!"

UCSantaBarbara,fmtvygo,t1_fmttcbg,1586379962.0,Are we reading the same email? He opens it by mocking all of the students who have been complaining about him assigning over two times the amount of work than he usually does during a normal quarter. He is ignoring basic grammar rules while explaining extremely difficult material. Students repeatedly keep asking him for more clarification and all he says is that he thought he explained himself well. Things could be easier for him if he took the help/advice from other faculty/students but he refuses to. Now his students are pretty much screwed. How does that make sense? How is that fair? You gotta feel for the man because he’s older but he’s making things way more difficult than it needs to be for himself and his students. You don’t know the situation.
