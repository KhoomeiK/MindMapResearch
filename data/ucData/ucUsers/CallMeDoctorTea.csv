I took Sato last year before graduating and went to every in person office hours. I left the office hour with an answer to my question, but since he spent the entire time asking follow up questions, I didn‚Äôt get time to ask my other questions since other people needed to get their questions answered too. His way of teaching goes way too in depth on 1 topic, which is fine for someone majoring specifically in molecular biology, but for the majority of us who are required to take this class to go on and take the MCAT (which I already have), I‚Äôll say that his way of teaching is pointless for us because as you‚Äôll see when you study for the mcat, none of those ‚Äúin depth‚Äù follow up questions will help you. You really just need to know the general concepts, specially on the biology portion where biochem also combined into it. In my opinion, your GPA will go down from his teaching style which, sadly enough now a days, is more important to med schools and more valuable than your in-depth knowledge of molecular biology. That‚Äôs my reasoning of why his teaching style just doesn‚Äôt work in the grand scheme of things. Anyways, regardless of what happens, power through his class and things will get better after. Trust :)"
