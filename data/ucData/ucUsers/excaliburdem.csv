CoDCompetitive,fpm32u4,t3_ge8vj9,1588724561.0,Funny that both LA NBA teams are really good right now but the LA CoD teams suck lol

unpopularopinion,fpbzvzc,t3_gcjma7,1588483268.0,"I think if the season was continuing you would see a lot less of such posts. It is exactly with ""everything going on"" that people have less to keep themselves occupied with and talk about. And its likely that many of these people haven't experienced real loss before. And even if they have, cultural figures are important to people even if they've never met. The combination of these leads me to say ""let them post."" But I will concede that there is some abuse over his death for clicks."
UCSD,fpbpi3z,t1_fpbp3on,1588475494.0,"the class had been run very poorly for the first 5 weeks. there were posted readings and assignments but no proper lecturing or office hours of any kind to help us with anything. Monday of this week was when things were supposed to get on track, but the department decided to intervene and get a new professor to teach the rest of the quarter from scratch. so not an error."
elo,fpbo9qj,t3_gchhww,1588474644.0,"i like it and prefer it to the original. not a huge fan of early ELO cuz of the production, but the 2012 version does a good job of cleaning up"
panicatthedisco,fp6wm2u,t1_fp6ju9r,1588359859.0,really? I always thought that the studio versions were far superior to the All my friends were glorious versions because of how Brendon had to change his voice. what do you folks like more about the live versions?
UCSD,fp6tagi,t3_gbh0k9,1588358220.0,"One of my classes literally hit reset. Wiped all the readings and modules and put a new one with the header ""***Welcome*** to SOC144."" Truly mindblown."

FallOutBoy,fnu5abp,t1_fnu4ega,1587254826.0,"The reasoning you gave for why you like TTTYG checks out from what I've seen others say about it. I guess I would qualify under that second wave of FOB fans; (pop) punk was fading away when I was growing up. But I do appreciate the older stuff. While SRAR is my personal favorite, I really like IoH and FaD, definitely more so than AB/AP and Mania. Furthermore, I would never go so far, like many newer fans, to say that Grave and Corktree are ""OK"" or ""bad."" I like them each album enough to call them at least ""Good."" The older albums evoke different feelings for me than the newer ones, which is not a bad thing. Boils down to tastes in music & upbringing, truly. But I can appreciate the ""punk"" aspects of the older stuff even if it isn't my preference."
FallOutBoy,fnu41ke,t1_fnu3r4u,1587254122.0,"Personally I don't understand why some people DO like it so much. I like it, and find it to be decent, but, compared to the others, I just don't find it to be particularly inspiring, musically. Just boils down to tastes in music I guess."

panicatthedisco,fm5l6kj,t1_fm5kdyk,1585775007.0,"Maybe its not grand. Maybe it is just the style after all. I'm new to Panic so i'm still evaluating my feelings towards everything, but DOAB just works! Still love every album, though."
