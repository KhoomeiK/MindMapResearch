cscareerquestions,fpltn55,t1_fplmyn4,1588719248.0,I'm in a similar boat as OP. My internship this summer got cancelled and i'm supposed to graduate sp2021. a lot of MS programs i know about are research based and I dont have research experience. any advice or thoughts on still applying to these?
berkeley,fplneb8,t1_fpjaa25,1588715873.0,Same. My landlord pressured me to renew my year long lease in feb and now I’m stuck paying for rent on an empty room.
berkeley,fp3i3dx,t3_gazqcb,1588279688.0,i did it over last summer. it was fun
berkeley,foxh45w,t3_ga1xmt,1588143815.0,do we have to apply for it?
berkeley,fot7c6g,t1_fos66kz,1588046303.0,^^^ tried cancelling and then tried negotiating lowering and landlord wouldn’t budge :(
berkeley,folknu8,t1_folfqkf,1587864298.0,"makes sense that they won't be able to do away with triples logistically, but maybe that's why in the email they recently sent out, they can't guarantee housing for freshman anymore."
berkeley,fnjkyts,t1_fnjktx5,1587001159.0,Thank  you! this was extremely helpful. I'll talk to my parents about this.
berkeley,fnjksp5,t1_fnjkhfg,1587001057.0,"I plan on talking to them soon, but I just want to know more about this process (and what i have on my side) since they will obviously not be happy that i want to cancel and I want to remain on good-terms if i continue to stay here."
berkeley,fnj74f6,t1_fnj605m,1586993227.0,yes!
berkeley,fmydstk,t3_fxq4av,1586483820.0,"Not only tuition, but for off-campus housing the adminstration should be clear in communicating this early. I've signed a lease for jun 2020 - may 2021. As of now, i'm already paying for an empty place during April, May, June, July part Aug. i would cry if i'm stuck in a lease during fall for a place im not living in."
berkeley,flygq59,t3_fqvplz,1585601837.0,"If I were you, I would go to UCLA because you seem like you would be much happier there.  


In terms of job prospects, I used to think that cal (especially EECS) would help me find jobs/internships easier. Now having gone through 2 recruitment cycles, I can tell you that in my personal experience, it doesn't matter too much. You just need some projects on your resume and do leetcode -- getting referrals also helps. I have friends at UCLA (who have similar background to me in terms of cs experience) who were able to get internships at microsoft their first year. Similarly there are people at cal who struggle getting internships at those big flagship companies in their sophomore/junior years. My point is, both schools are good enough that how you do in the job market will depend on the cs experience you curate at whatever university you go to. Also, even if you go to UCLA, you can apply for internships in the bay since most interviews for internships are done remotely  


As you stated, the UCLA student life in general is better-- i guess that y the rankings say it's #1 public :(( . Idk if you've visited Berkeley, but the surrounding neighborhood is sketchy and as a girl, I always have to find someone to walk with at night when I have to stay out for club activities and midterms are all at night. The food is not as great as UCLA and you have to find off-campus housing after your first year -- and landlords charge high prices and provide really old houses (mine still hasnt fixed the broken shower)."
