Detroit,fpku92y,t1_fpk8xlq,1588701132.0,"I‚Äôll stand firmly in the line of defending that Chicago pizza is not pizza. My partner and I went for the best deep dish pizza in town, Lou malnati‚Äôs. While we were waiting in line at the bar, we saw people sitting next to us chomping away at the thick-as-fuck dough and scooping off the tomato sauce... no thank you. We ordered thin crust instead.

Plus chicagoans are adamant on eating pizza with knife and fork for some reason- that says they really do know nothing about pizza. 

Can‚Äôt bash on their caramel popcorn though. Shit‚Äôs fire."

formula1,fnm8ttc,t3_g2kua7,1587067094.0,"Ok I'll be the devil's advocate then. I don't like Silverstone. I appreciate the heritage, the history, and the new Silverstone Wing facility looks fantastic. The fan turnout has been great. And if they have to have 3 races somewhere, being at a track within an arm's reach of majority of the team HQs probably helps a lot.

That said, the track itself I'm not a fan of. New Abbey and Copse felt the same. Club feels like one of those corners you're waiting forever to open up- and so is Brooklands-Luffield. Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel is great, but ""into Maggotts"" always reminds me of those small creepy crawly insects. Worst of all, being a WW2 airfield, the track is fucking flat- there's no elevation. And the scenery is meh. 

I'm very aware this is an unpopular opinion and I apologize for that. I'm emphatically not saying Silverstone sucks; it's a great GP, just not for me. But might as well double down then. If I have to choose a place in Europe to have 3 races, I would have gone for Austria, or Belgium, or Germany even."
