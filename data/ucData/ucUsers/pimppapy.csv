I used to think and agree with your mom's mentality, but as I'm in the second half of my thirties, I've come to realize something about *us* (Westernized Arabs). Our compatibility with our Arab and Western side varies per person and there is no clear cut way of how to handle our situations. There's a lot of *ideas* that I've come to think about regarding our situations...


* If they wanted us to live 100% arab based lives, they should have raised us in an Arab country

* **I choose** where I park my penis, not them!! (This one caused sandals to fly at me. . . rude/harsh, but true!) 

* What they consider the path to long term happiness doesn't apply to me because My mind shaped differently. (See first bullet) 

* Islamically: Women have just as much a right to choose who to marry as do men. It is a huge sin to force or even attempt to guilt a women to marry someone she does not want, but obviously, our people don't really abide by it and cultural honor trumps the basic understanding of the religion. 

Don't let it get to you. It's your life, your happiness, your body and most importantly, your future which your parents won't be apart of forever. In my case I married outside my race and religion twice and I somewhat normalized it. My sister married a White American guy too. Good for her!"

In a way I’m glad to see he made it to a UC, but after seeing this post, I think it’s safe to say, he never really cared about teaching and his endgame was always getting into a Uni for some kind of prestige/tenureship.
