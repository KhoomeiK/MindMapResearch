Also as an observation, the truly talented EE/CS guys that I've met are the most down to earth, humble, and kind men I have encountered in my life. It's typically the dudes who don't have substance to their personality / aren't actually super good at CS that feel a need to overcompensate with an inflated ego."

>Long story short, because of the situation we have fluctuations in enrollment and can't yet hire at full capacity. We've conducted interviews with an initial group of candidates but don't want to rule anyone out yet because of the ever-changing situation. Now that the class is definitely online over the summer, we hope to get a better idea of enrollment soon, which should help.Â "
berkeley,fmq2od8,t3_fwpnvg,1586291774.0,I've lived in the Bay my entire life (fremont --> berkeley). I've only felt the Alum Rock earthquake (2007) but it was just some mild shaking and nothing serious.
berkeley,fmq2dp5,t3_fwqd81,1586291620.0,"My friend tried doing this fall semester last year and it was a no gucci time for them, so they dropped 61b pretty soon into the course. Like the other commenter mentioned, deadlines are around the same time, and on top of that I think you have both signpost and midterm 1 pretty darn close together. Both classes are extremely debugging/project heavy, and on top of that 61c has a conceptual component that is a much greater load than 61b's. I think that 61c and 70 together are a much better idea. You can always take 61b afterwards (what I did)."

berkeley,fmn4wp3,t1_fmn4rne,1586218276.0,"CoC --> L&S

I was able to switch during my first semester. like I was a regular fall admit and I submitted my app around sep/oct fall 2018, and a few weeks later my calcentral showed up as ""undeclared L&S"" . No GPA requirement, no essay, just had to take a workshop and write down some administrative details. It's not particularly well known because most people don't make the decision to transfer their first semester, but it's a special clause that is explicitly written into the guidelines for advisors. My advisor didn't know about it until she combed through the files."

personally it's nbd for me, if you pursue the teaching community like CSM, course staff etc the ratios are pretty balanced. The only time where i've experienced the ratio being a thing is when i walked into my 61C final last semester and it felt like 70% of the people there were the same dudes in black north face / patagonia jackets and rectangle framed glasses."

berkeley,fmmxeia,t1_fmfdmtx,1586213911.0,"Life hack: CoC to literally any other college is doable your first semester. Just take classes as if you wanted to be in whatever major you were looking at. Talk to your advisor, there's a special pathway for first semester CoC freshmen to transfer to another college without ANY sort of GPA/essay requirement."

If you stay on top of a consistent schedule (ie study every day, not just when there's hw) and adequately prepare for exams and such around a week before, you won't end up as one of these horror stories."
