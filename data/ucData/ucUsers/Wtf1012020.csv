UCSC,fplzr9q,t3_ge2f1d,1588722643.0,What if we've already signed a contract with them?
UCSantaBarbara,fplzaho,t1_fply6v3,1588722383.0,"Alright. In the case of the 2 and 2 program, in which students are GUARANTEED off campus apartment housing, what do you think happens here? They cannot cancel contracts, especially since some students have no where else to go"
UCSantaBarbara,fply0jc,t3_ge6px1,1588721663.0,This means that freshman and transfers are screwed right? I can't see them cancelling contracts of returning student who have already signed one
UCSantaBarbara,fplar5w,t1_fpl64tm,1588709368.0,Then don't

Coronavirus,fonyqh1,t3_g8f0j1,1587929108.0,"Lol so much of this sub advocated for measures like these before this went down, ironic to see the majority consensus turning the other way"
Coronavirus,fomc957,t1_fom59mg,1587884906.0,"Lol u make so many assumptions. First of all, 80% of all infected people show little to no symptoms, let alone needing to visit the hospital. The sub you're referring to is a false sample size, if I were to put the tens of thousands of car crash victims in a room to show the perils of driving without showing the millions that are fine, the perception of driving dangers would be skewed as well. I'm so touched your concerned about me getting bankrupt from a hospital, yet ironically the prospect of no job, income, and dried savings are lost on you. I guess the best part of this will be not having to deal with people outside who always smugly think they know what's best for others and anyone who thinks contrary is an idiot. But here's the beauty of the situation. We're both free to do what we please. Just as you're happy to stay in all you want, others of us will start going out responsibily and neither group can force the other to differentiate. Good day"
Coronavirus,fom2yzc,t1_folml9u,1587876885.0,"Would rather be sick for 2 weeks than locked up for 2 years, so I'm more than happy to take my chances. Don't believe in handouts, so don't be too sad when you eventually stop getting yours and have to go to work again"

Coronavirus,fojwtn2,t1_fnzbc8t,1587831001.0,"This was never to distance until a vaccine was made, it was to buy time to make sure the health systems aren't overloaded and find better ways to quickly isolate cases. Stop moving the goal posts"
