UCSantaBarbara,fp3jxum,t3_gb34s8,1588280614.0,I am really trying to give them the space they need and time but itâ€™s week 5 and I havenâ€™t gotten a lab report back... the only thing I have graded are the computer graded quizzes.....
UCSantaBarbara,fn8a6zf,t3_fya9h8,1586737177.0,Hey I 100% get you. Iâ€™m also a freshman right now so hit me up if you want. I tried a few times to get involved but then I got intimated. I didnâ€™t go out because I didnâ€™t know how to. And I agreed to go out for Deltopia and now were all home. I spent the entirety of my winter quarter stressed about making friends yet im still going to go into sophomore year with a single college friend. I think it just comes easier to some than others.
UCSantaBarbara,fm9av70,t1_fm90u25,1585865035.0,I had purposely planned for my spring quarter to be easier and more itâ€™s day 4 and it feels like week 9
