leagueoflegends,fpmja4s,t3_ge0l62,1588734301.0,Tbh I think the punishment for verbal offenses is already working pretty well (maybe a little too well). I agree with what Dunkey had to say with verbal toxicity versus inting a game. I think that people who grief games deserve to be put with other griefers in longer queues.

I only used it for about 3 months and it crapped out on me. Key presses didn’t go through, keys clicked once gave 10+ inputs, and very laggy inputs sometimes. It is worth noting I got a refurbished one, so maybe just a dud. However, Velocifire wasn’t really that helpful in solving the problem."

However, if just look at the majority of people who make over 100k, and the majority of people who make under that, you will pretty easily see a pattern. Financial security and access to your wants have huge impacts on your happiness."
YasuoMains,fo4jndy,t1_fo49da9,1587505633.0,Nah his autos become dashes and they are reusable on the same target. Throw in some percent health dmg and a reset on duration every kill and you got a *balanced* rework.
