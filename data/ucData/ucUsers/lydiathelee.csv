berkeley,fo8nera,t1_fo7v0ms,1587599996.0,"That was around when I was an undergrad too. I don’t think anyone (or at least no one I knew) took it to mean, “You need to do these things in order to even have a chance of succeeding here.” Maybe we were simply insulated from the people who felt that way, but if anything it became a bit of a meme in a not-sarcastic/dark/angry way, e.g. “Lol Sahai”"

berkeley,fo5yqo9,t1_fo5qqrf,1587540162.0,"Out of curiosity, why is there so much dread surrounding Sahai teaching classes these days? In my undergrad (CS70 Fa14) his problem sets were time-consuming, sure, but he strongly abided by his philosophy of “tests should be easier than the homework.” His reputation was definitely more positive from what I remember, but maybe it’s because I wasn’t on Reddit then :P"
badroommates,fo5xpew,t1_fn4scyp,1587539157.0,"Yeah, it was only after a couple months of basically playing custodial staff to a walking, talking (lying, shedding, shitting) disaster that we sort of realized that it couldn’t be chalked up to “she’s never lived on her own before.” Yeah, nope, never again.

After she moved out she left a few things behind (a face towel, the odd knick-knack). She never ended up asking for them back, so when the usual housemates came back we had a lot of fun violently destroying it all!"

Don’t walk alone with your face buried in your phone at night (that’s also a great way to get hit by a car or bike regardless of where you are, though if you’re in the Bay it might be one of those motorized unicycles or a Lime scooter). Don’t leave your front door wide open. Don’t leave valuables in a parked car.

berkeley,fnbj6x0,t3_g0qees,1586816478.0,"Favorite:

* AAADS141 with Tom Fleming. Took this to fulfill a requirement, ended up loving the class even though each class was 3 hours from 18:00-21:00. Fleming is great at weaving in his own relevant experiences in a way that isn't self-aggrandizing or ""Back in my day...""
* Physics 137B with Müller. Took it for funsies because I liked 137A (Hedeman). At one point in the semester, he goes, ""I told you that you were going to have a second midterm...so uh, when do you want to have it?...(student gives a suggestion) Mm, that's the same week as Thanksgiving, maybe another time."" The test ended up being optional, take-home, you could work in groups, and you could use whatever resources you wanted as long as you cited.

Least Favorite:

* CS61C. And this is speaking as someone who's in grad school for EE. All of Dan Garcia and Miki Lustig's enthusiasm couldn't get around the fact that the class for me was miserable (one of the midterms was two questions long, and staff figured out that one of them was undoable *after* the test). I also made the mistake of taking way too heavy a courseload that semester, which definitely made things worse. The one good thing to come of that class was this gem: [https://imgur.com/x15TMrR](https://imgur.com/x15TMrR)"

berkeley,flt72p4,t1_flt6cmj,1585461379.0,"Previous semesters are sometimes used to calibrate grade bins. Given this semester’s extenuating circumstances, there’s basically no precedent for how to distinguish an A- from B+. This is especially true now that there’s pretty much no way to proctor exams."
