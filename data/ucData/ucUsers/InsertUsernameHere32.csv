Idk about that. It was a good episode but then the mirror plotline would drag on too much. I really hope it gets resolved by episode 19 or at least have Iris come out of the mirror before then. Eva isn't that compelling to have a cliffhanger like that."
FlashTV,foxgaim,t1_fox1hac,1588143097.0,I think it had something to do with Eva escaping. Extra fighting power if she needed to fight Barry.

FlashTV,fovu1ba,t1_fov6m46,1588107514.0,It’s too slow. It’s facing the same issue as Savitar. They took so long to reveal him and they’re taking too long to reveal the mirror master plan and release Iris from the mirror verse

PS4,fosjcpz,t1_fosgetp,1588031846.0,"Ok yes. I admit. In a world like this maybe calling people ""heroes or villains"" is wrong but I've seen the cutscenes. The way ND portrays Abby (at least in the first half) through some major fights and plot events is as an antagonist. That being said, maybe she can be redeemed in the second half, but cutting the game in half with two protagonists, one of which kills the others is just plain stupid. It's like if in GTA V, you started out the game as Michael with Franklin being an antagonist, and then you play as Franklin for the second half and choose the ending where you kill Michael. It's pretty fucking stupid. And even with Franklin being the game from the start, no one chooses the endings where you kill Michael or Franklin. It's fucking dumb.

It's one thing to make assumptions which I admit I was doing by calling her the villain but I've seen some leaked cutscenes from the first half which do show her as an antagonist which you can't deny."
PS4,fosg33s,t1_forw499,1588030021.0,"Yea I'm pretty sure since after Uncharted 4, they've been having leaks on the crunches and bad management. But to be fair so has CDProjekt Red."

Yea I'm glad I never got into the LoU. I would be fucking furious with ND after this garbage they put out."
PS4,fosfbpc,t1_fosenbx,1588029597.0,"Same. It truly is a disgrace to all the fans, Sony, and especially all the developers who went through a massive crunch to release the first game and then have to program this abomination."
PS4,fosez9r,t1_fosd72e,1588029405.0,">To play it and become emotionally invested in the story as you’re spending time with it.

Yes but it doesn't work that way when you make the player play the first half of the game as the main character and then make them play the second half as the villain. If we played the whole game as Abby going after some terrible enemy with a big reveal at the end showing that she was going after Joel and Ellie the whole time, the twist would have been much better. Here we only play as Abby in half of the game and not even the beginning which is frankly just fucking stupid."
PS4,foseozb,t1_fosa09q,1588029247.0,"To be fair in Mafia 2, you do end up killing the main character in Mafia 1 but that was already initially shown way back in Mafia 1, and the main characters of Mafia 2 are so much better.

What ND is doing is so fucking retarded. It's as if in RDR2 you play as Arthur and the game ends with you killing John Marston. Like wtf??? If you wanna kill your main character, let them die respectfully; don't make your player kill their favorite character, especially as some random nobody not in the first game."

This Abby shit was so fucking dumb and I lowkey hope LOU2 tanks in sales cause of it."

FlashTV,fo6f5y3,t1_fo5q3ne,1587557038.0,What were you guys excepting? This episode is a filler because it was supposed to come out weeks ago. There wasn’t supposed to be any break but COVID-19 ruined the schedule. The artificial break created a not intended cliffhanger and I think increased your expectations for something that was not going to happen. Also I’m pretty sure the mirror story is the main plot of the season so it won’t go away anytime soon.

First of all, doing Crisis without the show that started this all would be stupid and secondly they did this stupid AF. This was Amell's last big crossover and he was basically in it for only like 2 episodes. He was barely in episode 3 and not at all in episode 2 and they cheapened his death by killing him off twice. It's a fucking sham what they did."
