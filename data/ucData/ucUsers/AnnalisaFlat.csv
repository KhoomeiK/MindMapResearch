berkeley,fo5weca,t3_g5und9,1587537889.0,"Just a heads up, I talked to my advisor (bio-business advisor, who works very close with haas) and she said that haas will only be considering Spring 2020 so far as to make sure you have crossed off prerequisites- they will not account for grades, since it would give those who opt for a grade an advantage over those who didnt if grades were considered. However, using the semester to boost your gpa is/was not a bad idea, i dont think they are factoring out spring‚Äôs impact on your gpa."
berkeley,fo56m7v,t3_g5rpwn,1587518638.0,"Cap yourself at 4 individual classes- i had 13 units but it was four classes (chem and chem lab are separate) and I had a really successful first semester that boosted my confidence going into second semester. You‚Äôll be getting involved in a ton of new things and living on your own probably for the first time, which takes a lot more mental energy than you might think. Listen to the L&S recommendation!"
berkeley,fo4rria,t3_g5p2r6,1587509952.0,"The program is relatively new so the first batch of applicants ever got acceptances this February. Not gonna lie, I‚Äôm pursuing Bio-Business (current freshman) and the numbers are kinda discouraging. To estimate the applicant pool, people have to take a seminar freshman spring to qualify to apply for the major- there were about 100 students in the class, all talented in their own right. One day in class, they briefly mentioned how many kids were accepted: it was a number between 10 and 20. In official news on the Haas website, they said they were aiming to admit a max of 25 each year. At best, the acceptance rate is 25%. To be fair, I do not know how many kids took the seminar last year and how many quit the program before the application process ultimately occurred, so the percent may be higher, but getting into Haas is really not guaranteeable."
berkeley,fnqtpy6,t3_g3e6cl,1587172011.0,"I cancelled my Physics C exams and sent in a form (I think it was on the map@berkeley portal?) and I was 100% good- your admission shouldnt be revoked. And keep in mind, that was a year when we DIDNT have a Pandemic and I didnt have a good reason to cancel my exams (it was the monday after prom and I was too lazy to study.) so especially this year, they‚Äôre likely expecting students to cancel some of their exams. the form has an option on a drop down menu for what type of admission update you are giving, so its probably a common update they get and I promise it WONT be an issue. 

As far as worth it, I‚Äôm pretty sure like you already said the Physics 1 and 2 exam fulfill no requirements, you would just be getting empty credits towards your degree. It helps with ‚Äústanding‚Äù - basically if you have 30-60 units or so you‚Äôre sophomore standing, 60-90 junior standing, 90-120 senior standing. It will mean you get a better enrollment time relative to people with less standing than you (with the exception of those with priority enrollment.) Gage that how you will

If you have any doubts at all I would call the admissions office, but you shouldnt have a problem cancelling those exams as long as you submit the update form!"
berkeley,fnjwd51,t1_fni5vhc,1587008561.0,"My favorite chegg entry I saw when I looked today was ‚Äúone hour thirty minutes to complete‚Äù as a header for multiple pages of exam questions

Very stupid that one not only consults chegg but makes it blatantly obvious they are participating in some sort of timed assessment

Also loved ‚Äúplease show all steps with arrow pushing plz‚Äù

Yes by asking chegg nicely with a ‚Äúplz‚Äù you‚Äôll definitely get the answers you need lol"
berkeley,fnixoqz,t1_fnix2t2,1586988209.0,"I can‚Äôt tell, maybe its a paywall situation or maybe Vollhardt and the GSI‚Äôs investigated with Chegg directly and thats why there was such a delay in hearing about this? Couldnt tell ya"
berkeley,fniwxez,t1_fniuiw0,1586987822.0,It was a B-course announcement and it looks like it was sent to all sections so you should have received it if you‚Äôre in ochem
berkeley,fnids6s,t1_fnid64z,1586978289.0,"Not just word for word, straight up screenshotted questions from the exam pdf

I get it its ochem its hard but dang how does one still feel the need to cheat with an OPEN NOTE midterm that is already 4 hours instead of 90 minutes?? I guess people ARE that dumb"
berkeley,fnicn9s,t1_fnice0z,1586977747.0,"You have to buy the subscription to see the actual answers, but you can see all the questions that are asked. I just typed chegg question answer into my search bar and filtered to the exam day in the chemistry category to see the madness"
berkeley,fni4rki,t1_fni4b5s,1586973964.0,"You can view all the questions and answers submitted, I just looked at the chegg submissions from April 4th its so baddd"

berkeley,fni3kyi,t1_fnhy67x,1586973387.0,"‚ÄúHaving said this, I was disappointed to discover that a limited number of students cheated on the exam. Armed with our formidable TA and computer power, we monitored the internet during and after the test, an effort that immediately revealed that some of you consulted with a number of web-based outfits (for example, Chegg), by submitting selected problems from the exam and receiving corresponding answers. This information was then disseminated to others. Ironically, most of the answers were wrong and, indeed, diagnostically ludicrous.

To those of you who engaged in this activity (you and I know who you are), and for the reassurance of the vast majority of the class who worked honestly, let me say this:

You broke your pledge from page 1:
 ‚ÄúI pledge to maintain the integrity of this exam. As such, I pledge to abide by the exam instructions specified and to withhold communication through any means with anyone about the content of the exam until the entire class and I have completed it. I understand that breaking this pledge constitutes an academic transgression that will be reported to the office of student conduct and will result in an F grade for the course.‚Äù

I will withhold judgement on you until it is time to assign grades, but the options that present themselves are (with increasing severity of the transgression):
A zero in exam 2.
A grade of F for the course.
A grade of F for the course and dismissal from the university.
I am also considering administering an oral final exam to a select few.

I would be happy to entertain your explanation for your actions by e-mail and/or Zoom.

P. Vollhardt‚Äù


TL:DR people screenshotted literally every page of the exam onto that chegg study thing where an expert will answer the question for you and expected not to get caught lol and now Vollhardt is laying it on them"
berkeley,fn5ol4y,t3_fzqsjf,1586670750.0,"I wouldn't recommend putting the Blackwell single- there are only a couple in the building so it is very unlikely, and especially since you're coming in with a roommate it is a waste of your #2 priority spot. Even though you have regents (which unofficially gives you a good chance at your top housing selections) a ton of regents scholars gun for blackwell, so you will have a ton of competition for maybe 10 or 20 single rooms, not to mention people with disabilities or special accommodations who will get these rooms above all else. No harm in putting the doubles though.

Other than that it looks good!"
berkeley,fm9u3y3,t3_ftx7ax,1585876609.0,SAME. All the GSI‚Äôs are also giving people 3a midterm review as if we didnt have these 3 labs on a subject we‚Äôve never seen due at the exact same time üßê
