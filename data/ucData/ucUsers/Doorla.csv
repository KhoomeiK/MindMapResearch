I think its just how their trainers, peers and environment nurtures them to become excellent in their craft.

I'll call that a win.... fits the concept perfectly LOL.

I thought the choreo looked weird the first time I saw it, but it grew on me. It is so different, which makes it memorable. tbh if I was in a game of Kpop charades I won't know how to convey fire truck or Simon says (maybe the 'my my my my' part?). 

Nowadays since we have so many Kpop dances it is hard to stand out, but I think 'Kick it' really did that well (whether it is in a good or bad way).... so I think that's all that matters. 

Also I guess we can all agree that Taeyang can make any choreo look cool, even ones that are ""chicken -like"" LOL. Now I really want him to try  'Feel Special' dance break and see if can pull it off! :D HAHAH"

unpopularkpopopinions,fopyoza,t3_g8us6o,1587976661.0,"I disagree... I think you're reading too much into it. A lot of groups have members that have a special persona that the company assigned to them, besides it will be kind of psychotic if a company pushes a completely different personality for an idol to put on... 24/7. I think that's not realistic and its more risky if they 'slip up' ever so often. I think what the company does is look at the personality of their idols and pick up certain traits that they want them to magnify for the audience. 

Also it is not only YG that does that. For example, Jaehyun of NCT has once said on a Vlive that it is a little exhausting to put on his ""prince"" image that SM has given him.

unpopularkpopopinions,fod2pem,t3_g6khkt,1587679098.0,"THIS! I am so sick of people saying that Way V is the best unit and that 127 is the worse. I As a 127 fan, I just think that it is impossible to compare them. Yes you can say you prefer C-Pop over hip hop/trap style Kpop but you can't just say one unit is better than the other

Also comparing them in terms of visuals is just ridiculous. this doesn't make you a 'better' group. Also beauty is VERY subjective. (I am Chinese myself and prefer Korean visuals. \*^(Jaehyun.).. I guess the grass is always greener on the other side)

In terms of dance, there are weak links in every group and also standouts. personally I prefer groups that have people that showcase a variety if style, like seeing Haechan's smooth moves next to Yuta's powerful move is just \*chef's kiss\*. And even if they are ""weaker dancers"", everyone being too good actually bores me? I don't know if anyone else feels the same.

personality wise, if someone says another thing about 127 being awkward with each other I will personally slam them against the wall. the other groups being loud and goofy together doesn't mean they have the best relationship with each other. We also don't know about their private lives. rather than focusing on their relationships with one another, I like to appreciate their each individual personalities and work ethic. I really like 127 because I see them as very considerate, hard working, young men and I really like how they each contribute such a different color to the group."
