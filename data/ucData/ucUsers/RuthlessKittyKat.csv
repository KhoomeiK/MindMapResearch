Just be like hey, we are having this problem and I'm wondering if you can help solve it. You may get farther than you think. Even better, you can get together as a group and ask for help. It's best to frame it in that way so people can save face.

There's a few things that I find interesting. You say she ""admitted"" she wanted to eat healthier. What led up to that exactly? Did you make comments about her weight to her? How did she come to think of herself as fat?

Also, just for reference, ""if she had lost 1.5lb or more she  could have a cheat and the rest of the time we would eat healthy food,  get plenty of exercise, etc."" this is dumb as hell strategy. Really sit and think about what you are doing there. 

And yeah, you picked the wrong time to do this. You know, better yet, have a conversation with your family before or encourage your daughter to do so. Number one, you're daughter should be leading the way with her choices. Don't embarrass her yeesh. But also, your relatives should not be shutting out a child based on her mother's mistakes. That's also not cool."
