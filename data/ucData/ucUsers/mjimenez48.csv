ucr,fp6fl1v,t3_gbfik4,1588351493.0,"Well I lived in building A and itâ€™s one of the older buildings. I think A-D are the oldest one but Iâ€™m not sure. 

I absolutely loved living in A building though. I didnâ€™t mind that it was older than the other buildings or that it was more of a walking distance to campus. Scottyâ€™s, the laundry area, and the game room are right downstairs so it was super convenient. 
I loved my room and I loved that I had an actual closet and not a dresser like the new buildings have. Also the bathroom area has drawers under the sink and my friend who lived in J said they didnâ€™t have those anymore. We had enough space in the common areas and I thought that my room had enough space too. 

The only thing I didnâ€™t like is living next to the field. They made so much noise at night sometimes!!!!"
ucr,fp427vn,t1_fp3z3n0,1588290244.0,The dining halls! But Bytes or Scottyâ€™s by the HUB has some sometimes!

ucr,fovgm2u,t3_g9q9q3,1588100976.0,I didnâ€™t get this email. Should I contact someone?! ðŸ˜­
ucr,fotlw4u,t3_g9iezg,1588058031.0,In the same boat!!! Had so many plans for this quarter and with this quarantine I havenâ€™t been able to do anything. Feeling more lost than ever.
ucr,folq4rq,t3_g7z3o3,1587867854.0,No no the templates are for the pathways that she will teach you! Donâ€™t worry sheâ€™ll upload the templates and you can print them out. And no sorry I made actual flash cards and hand wrote everything ðŸ˜”
ucr,foklmwr,t3_g7z3o3,1587844372.0,"Unfortunately I didnâ€™t complete a word doc because I wrote out all the learning objectives as a quiz and thatâ€™s how I would study before the exams. 

Best advice I could give you is practice the templates over and over! Spaced repetition and studying every day for her class is a must! Know all your amino acids and all the sugar structures. Do flash cards for them. Also I used a white board to practice the structures and the templates.  

Practice the templates at least 3 times a day until you can do them in your sleep! Forwards and backwards.

Make sure you understand all of the concepts and be able to fully apply them to any situation she may give you. 

I know it sounds a bit extreme but if you understand the learning objectives, the homeworkâ€™s, do well on the quizzes, and know the templates you should do well in the class. It was definitely exhausting studying for her class but itâ€™s worth it. Her exams are long but pretty straightforward. Best of luck!"
