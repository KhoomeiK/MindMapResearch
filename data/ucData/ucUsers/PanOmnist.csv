CSUS,fp9y062,t1_fp9mcw2,1588436894.0,"That’s the Declaration of Independence, not the constitution. All rights are conditional. During World War II we rationed food, redirected industry and limited freedom of speech in the face of existential crisis. The government can limit non content specific speech if it has a compelling overriding interest. Mass death, exponentially larger than 9/11, seems pretty damn compelling. You sound like a child throwing a temper tantrum."
CSUS,fp9wyr0,t1_fp9nx3c,1588436285.0,"They government is saying to stay inside to curb the spread of the virus. You can still go outside, enforcement has been light so far. They’ve appealed to common sense and respect for the life of your fellow citizen instead of the coercive power of the state. So your freedoms not really under assault, you’ve been told the course of action that is in the best interest of your community and country and asked to do your part.

But ironically by ignoring the reality of the virus these kinds of gatherings increase the spread of the virus and thus how long we will be in a state of quarantine. Apparently respect and common sense is in short supply. Patriotism is about responsibility, this video is an exercise of entitlement. They are increasing the length quarantine will be likely have to be in place."

GradSchool,fol66jy,t3_g801gl,1587855659.0,"In papers you can organize your thoughts and address succinctly all the various facets and nuances of an idea. In Auditory communication you have a few sentences before it’s the other person turn. In some academic conversations there is always a tension between trying to communicate that you’ve considered the question from multiple view points and just s-ing tfu so the other person can also get a word in edgewise. Additionally making sure that what you mean and what you are say line up is more difficult on the fly.

So you’re not alone. I think more is less. Don’t be afraid to stop talking even if what you said didn’t come out correctly."
UCDavis,fogxe4i,t1_fogln9y,1587758060.0,"They didn’t know how long or how bad the wildfires would be and there was no legal precedent for canceling a whole quarter. So either they’d be criticized for cheating students out of tuition or snd maybe sued, or for not knowing the future. They chose to based on early evidence to keep the campus open. So they had a choice of bad options and chose what made the most sense at the time. When the virus started they moved to online well before the state and US issued the stay at home orders. 

But yah, I do think your generally negative and fact resistant attitude might account for how you’re painting UCD to prospective transfers."
UCDavis,fog4wig,t1_fof1xtb,1587747927.0,"This is hot noise and just factually untrue. 

Davis has a lot going on, the clubs at night are fun, the and the bar culture is really healthy. For parties you have to know people though. It’s not a house party scene. So you’ll need to make friends if you want to “rage”. As for the chancellor UCD is usually the first to react to situations and took the led on the covid response. Campus was literally JUST renovated so I don’t know what you’re talking about. I reviewed some of your previous comments. Missed passed times, what to do if you don’t meet a deadline ect ect. 

I didn’t get the feeling Davis was the cause of your problems."
