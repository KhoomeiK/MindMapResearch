UCSC,fny9pe9,t1_fny657r,1587356942.0,It was supposed to but I’m not sure given the current stuff going on. I was in RCC this past year and I loved it though and based on your interests I think you might too

surfing,fnr8sji,t3_g369rt,1587182141.0,glassing question: I just finished the deck of my board and there is a small area where the lap never made it over on the rail(6oz) but it is covered by the glass from the bottom of the board(4oz). Will I be fine if I just add a hot coat and polish coat on top of it without adding more fiberglass?

college,fncuwu8,t3_g0qbye,1586848042.0,"If you can afford it, I would dorm. Dorm life during freshman year is pretty fun and getting to meet so many people and live with them is pretty great. If after your first year you really need to save money, moving back home could work or you could find an apartment or house with friends you meet as well for cheaper than the dorm prices."
