However, I believe the question would have been better served by saying ""natural growth"" rather than just growth. Growth can and does occur past the steady state, albeit at increasingly inefficient returns. If it didn't, then there wouldn't be a reason for us to discuss how economies slide back down towards the steady state.

I hope that doesn't come off as hostile. I just wanted to clarify my issue with the question."
UCSantaBarbara,fow7ne0,t1_fow7c45,1588114521.0,"I totally understand that things are different bc of online classes, but the way this class has been handled so far is just pants-on-head dumb."
UCSantaBarbara,fow71b4,t3_g9xigd,1588114198.0,"I think the tipping point for me was Question #4 on Lecture Quiz #7. She (or the TA) made zero reference to which side of the steady state the economy was on, which turned the right answer into a 50/50 guess. Then, she goes on to defend it in the next lecture! Bruh moment.

EDIT: Also I just realized that this has become a rant post"

UCSantaBarbara,fo7kmbn,t1_fo7eqrr,1587579936.0,"Did he say that the gladiatorial fights impeded economic progress or that forced servitude/slavery impeded economic progress. Morals have jack shit to do with economic progress, but slavery and forced servitude does impede economic progress by distorting the productivity and labor cost of the workforce. Why put effort into the creation of more efficient machines when you can just shove a bunch of slaves out into the field?"

UCSantaBarbara,fniagb4,t1_fni6njc,1586976702.0,"> I have lectures that are supposed to be only 50 minutes that are now consistently well over an hour long and in the long term this adds up


Dude, I'm taking C LIT 30C and we were assigned 4-5 hours of lectures in Week 1 and ~3 hours per week afterwards for what was a 50 min per week class. I feel you."
