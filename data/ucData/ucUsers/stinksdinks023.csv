Even though I didnâ€™t apply to PV, Iâ€™m sure a lot of the stuff you said is pretty uniform across the other ACC buildings :) really hoping I get into one of them! I also applied to the on campus graduate dorms but the ACC ones are furnished and have AC so Iâ€™d much rather get one of them but Iâ€™ll take anything at this point ðŸ˜‚"
UCI,fo45npd,t1_fo3ph6v,1587498613.0,SHE GOES TO UCI?!?! Omg Iâ€™m starting my masters program this fall in the business school and now Iâ€™m always going to be looking for her haahhhaa
UCI,fnzrtzv,t1_fnzqswi,1587399638.0,Okay! I was thinking itâ€™d probably be around July so Iâ€™ll just wait :) how did you like PV? Iâ€™m regretting not applying there and I think itâ€™s too late now haha but Iâ€™ll just be glad if I get one placement. ðŸ˜„
