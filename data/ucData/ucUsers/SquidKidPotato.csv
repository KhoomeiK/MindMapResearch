berkeley,fou8vpd,t3_g9avi4,1588079091.0,"I think a post about the logistics and when to take what class would be very helpful. 
As an incoming CS hopeful freshman, I’m also very interested in knowing how to approach projects and hw. That’s a great topic idea!"
berkeley,fou8l0v,t1_fosojsz,1588078898.0,Hey I’m an incoming student as well. I’m pretty clueless about summer classes. How did you go about signing up for one? Are registrations closed?
berkeley,fop4mx1,t1_fop0swi,1587952980.0,I was looking forward to some club penguin bangers
learnprogramming,fooh6b4,t3_g8lhp5,1587938889.0,I’m currently a beginner learning python as my first language. Could you give pointers on how you went about learning how to do that? Maybe even share a link to the code?
learnpython,fo30ehr,t1_fo2vwa0,1587478114.0,"Thanks for the info! I’m on Mac, though I’m sure the process should be similar to windows."
learnpython,fo2rgje,t1_fo2j4v8,1587472194.0,Where does the file need to be in order to be usable by pandas or the included csv package? Like can my csv be saved anywhere on my computer or do I import it somewhere or something  like that?
learnpython,fo2rclt,t1_fo28o0b,1587472108.0,I have pandas installed. My main question I if I download a csv from online and try to use it in pycharm as df=pd.read_csv(“nameoffile.csv”) how would the program know where to look on my computer for that file? I’m in Mac
learnpython,fo1rh3i,t1_fo1psr6,1587439787.0,"Thanks for the help. I tried doing what you said, but I guess because I'm using a mac your exact answer won't work. I'll have to play around with it to get the file directories to work."
learnpython,fo1n9cx,t3_g4iiwc,1587437027.0,"This is a pretty silly question but, how do I use a csv in pycharm? I've tried looking for answers but somehow can't figure it out. Python is my first language ever, and I started learning a few weeks ago so please explain as easily as possible."
berkeley,fmqan04,t1_fm9tsxi,1586296030.0,"I'm definitely not ding math just for the name. In fact, I've always wanted to be a math major, and only over the past few years have I gotten into CS. Could you give some insights on what the pure math prereq classes are like? Thanks so much."
berkeley,fm7p9m0,t1_fm6vnea,1585833675.0,Thanks for the answer! That sounds insane. Is it alright if I PM you some questions?
