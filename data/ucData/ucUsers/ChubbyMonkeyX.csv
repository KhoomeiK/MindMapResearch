Unless people are hunting wolves, the population is probably at it’s carrying capacity even if it’s a mere 3 and 4."

bayarea,fohhzak,t1_fogk73k,1587766293.0,Yeah and who lobbied them to write the tax laws?  The problem isn't the government OR corporations.  It's both; the revolving door and the system that allows consolidation of power is really to blame.  Corporations are the sycophants and the government is the enabler.

media_criticism,fm22rto,t1_fm205el,1585689563.0,"I feel like this is the correct definition. A lean—whether it be dramatic or slight, right or left—doesn’t exclude a particular source from being part of MSM.  I think it’s high ratings that make it part of the mainstream, a common underlying thread being that they’re owned by money and corporate power rather than being truly free press."
