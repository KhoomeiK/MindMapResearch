ucla,foshl03,t3_g6skad,1588030856.0,"60s cluster provided a lot of the highlights of my first year! Fink and Vavreck in particular are great lecturers, and the seminar I ended up in basically kept me sane during spring quarter(it was on sci fi but I‚Äôm pretty sure the seminar subjects change every year. It was very freeform and we watched lots of movies.) I think it is considered a lighter cluster. I don‚Äôt recall having to write a paper that was over 5 pages long, but the kind of papers we wrote were pretty different from what I was used to in high school, so keep that in mind. My TAs (at least the ones I had) were very understanding of how new we all were to this and made sure the clusters felt like transitionary classes. Honestly, choose a cluster whose content you‚Äôre already interested in. If you‚Äôre not into it from the get go, you‚Äôll probably start hating the class due to the workload or feel burnt out on the subject itself. Clusters get hella sold to you at orientation, but if you‚Äôre not feeling any of them, choose other GEs. However, it did make me worry a little less every time my enrollment pass came around."

Honestly, the biggest factor in not thinking your cluster a slog is already liking the subject taught in it. The TA you pick for fall+winter and the spring seminar also matters a lot. You might end up with weekly course reader assignments, a participation based open ended discussion, or not having to speak up in class at all."

writing,eq0dt0q,t3_bvdoic,1559682822.0,"It‚Äôs my first time submitting any kind of writing for publication. I submitted my story to some magazines a few hours ago. I‚Äôm not serious about becoming a writer as anything other than a hobby, I just did it as a ‚Äúwhat do I have to lose?‚Äù thing. Problem is, I confused ‚Äúsimultaneous submission‚Äù with ‚Äúmultiple submissions,‚Äù and ended up sending my story to multiple publishers that don‚Äôt allow that. I know I should have looked this up, but I‚Äôm feeling very embarrassed right now. I sent out emails asking to withdraw my submission with my ID number from the online portal they use. I didn‚Äôt see a ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù button on any of them. I doubt the story has been opened by any of the publications. Will my request be honored, or is my amateur writing stint over before it has begun?

EDIT: I‚Äôm not trying to come off as arrogantly assuming that two publishers will want my story and problems arising then. I‚Äôm more concerned that the similar online submission portals that the magazines use have some way of notifying other publishers of similarly titled/authored submissions to auto-reject or something, and they‚Äôll know to keep rejecting me without reading if I try submitting other stories in the future."
