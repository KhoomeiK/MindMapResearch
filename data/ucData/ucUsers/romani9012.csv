It‚Äôs comforting to learn that study abroad can actually help anxiety no matter how intimidating it may seem and difficult it may be at first. I‚Äôm also happy to hear that there are health services that include therapy while abroad, and that people seem to make use of them.  And yes, planning for the worst is such good advice given what is going on right now. All of this information is very helpful!

I‚Äôm so sorry that you had to go through that experience, and I sincerely hope you‚Äôre doing much better now.

berkeley,fnq9lb4,t3_g3aprh,1587160327.0,"Hey, congrats on Berkeley! I‚Äôm a 2nd year poli sci major so perhaps I could give you some input:

1) My experiences so far have been in the middle (like lots of other departments). Some professors are amazing- experts in their field, great lecturers, approachable and engaged w/ students. However there are others that can come off a bit stand-offish, or just aren‚Äôt interesting lecturers. Same thing with classes. Some have been really enlightening, while others I felt like I could learn the material from Google if I just put in the time. And for the notorious PS3 class, it isn‚Äôt bad at all until the last few weeks. If you‚Äôve never taken a stats class in high school, you might struggle a bit for the last few topics that they cover, but it wasn‚Äôt impossible to get an A. 

2) Intro classes tend to be the biggest with the most at 200+ people, but otherwise upperdivs can range from 50 to 150(? Not too sure- with classes online I forgot how big my lectures were lol). Luckily there are discussion sections for most PS classes, and those range from 20-30 people, maybe less, so no need to feel nervous about big classes.

Hope this answers your questions. Feel free to reply or PM if you have more !"

I‚Äôve had shortness of breath/have been hyper-aware of my breathing the past week because of COVID scares, but in reality, it‚Äôs tricks your brain can play when in a fight-or-flight state. One of the best things you can do is to exercise. Not only does it release endorphins, but it will refresh both your mind and your body (and it‚Äôs healthy of course). Unfortunately, anxiety can work in crazy ways and have really terrifying physical symptoms that go along with it.
