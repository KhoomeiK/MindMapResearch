aggies,fp8vij0,t1_fp8uggk,1588404424.0,and you didn't either bud. stop making yourself feel good. we're all in the same boat
aggies,fp8uvmp,t1_fp89k66,1588403789.0,"Where the fuck did I mention a ""high failure rate"" in my post? I'm saying the quality is much better over there because it is a significantly more challenging and theoretical academic experience, which obviously means the classes are going to be more difficult, and this is also the same for other top engineering schools such as Caltech and MIT. If you think these top schools have shitty teachers, you're only clowning yourself bud. The academics at these schools are brutal, but students will have so many more opportunities and are usually hired at the best tech firms and attend top grad schools consistently upon graduating. Please learn how to read."
aggies,fp8twp8,t1_fp8tj61,1588402850.0,"ok sure bud. and I'm pretty sure berkeley doesn't give scholarships nor grants to oos students, which implies you don't even know what you're talking about."
aggies,fp8t6wu,t1_fp8hkeb,1588402172.0,you couldn't either. also our egos should be the same since we go to the same school.
aggies,fp55bid,t1_fp54qzh,1588316797.0,"b/c this was only one of the only two schools I got into, the other being ut Dallas (which is too close to my home to my liking)"
aggies,fp549id,t1_fp53b08,1588315814.0,"If that way of thinking makes you feel better about going here, go for it, b/c it's not making me feel any better about my college choice. Also no matter how much I'm swayed into attending a certain school, I can't attend if I can't even get in you know what I mean?"

aggies,fp4yx6h,t1_fp4xld6,1588311161.0,"In general, UCB students are much stronger than A&M. Just look at the rankings in engineering and CS, almost insurmountable difficulty of classes over there, and the career outcomes and starting salaries of their engineering grads (which are typically six figures). Of course, there's probably a handful of Aggie engineers that would do well in Berkeley's rigorous academic environment, but that's not the case for most Aggie students when in fact the academics over there is too strenuous for many Berkeley students . I'm not trying to bash A&M's great engineering program or its students, but there's a reason why Berkeley was one of my top choices, but unfortunately I wasn't able to get in."
aggies,fp4xgwi,t1_fp4wp8e,1588309992.0,How's this a contest? I'm about to go here too.
aggies,fp4wilj,t1_fp4voak,1588309246.0,An alarming concern from aggys too incompetent for berkeley engineering
aggies,fossi58,t1_fosm6ua,1588037131.0,That's just your opinion bro - you can't generalize that to every UT student.
aggies,forvguz,t1_forg3pq,1588019220.0,What year are you if you don't mind me asking?
aggies,fork7jg,t3_g95iwk,1588013617.0,Damn all of you downvoters are hella salty y'all didn't get into UT as well bc I know for a fact that was your dream school and now you gotta settle for A&M

berkeley,fnn385x,t3_g2r86e,1587083455.0,"It's harder to transfer from another UC compared to a California community college because Berkeley aims to prioritize the latter group of students in transfer admissions. So if you really want to transfer to Berkeley, you realistically have a better chance of at a CCC. However, I do personally know people who transferred here from other UC's."
ApplyingToCollege,fn8zzc7,t3_g0ccw7,1586755019.0,"I don't think your instagram following will mind at all because things like this happens all the time, including myself. It's a very natural situation and you don't need to feel any need to explain yourself to them if you don't want to; they'll understand, especially with all the uncertainty happening in the world right now. But if you want to, maybe you can make a post or add a story to let them know about this change. BTW, what two colleges if you don't mind sharing?"

berkeley,fm4ml9r,t3_fswmz7,1585756915.0,Dm me. I'll take a look.
