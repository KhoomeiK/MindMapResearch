ac_newhorizons,fonu3iz,t1_fomg3on,1587926487.0,"The museum is on the 3rd level. So the lowest level of the dog site is on 1st level, and I’ve built 2-levels of cliff from the center. That makes the tallest one the same level as the museum. Hope this helps!"
ac_newhorizons,foj0i5i,t1_foizjqs,1587803566.0,"My theory is that you will eventually get access to all the fruits and flowers but it would take a long time. My native fruit is orange, my sister fruit is cherry and mom sent me apple. Then two weeks ago Daisy Mae sent me some bamboo shoots and my villager randomly supplied me with some peach when I talked to them. Same thing with the nook’s. There are 3 flower seeds that’s super common in their store but I’ve seen 2 more showed up randomly, and Leif is supposed to carry the seeds that are rare to your nook’s store. But obviously all of those are random and depending on your luck, it could take you a long time to get all of them."
ac_newhorizons,foiqtyn,t1_foimuou,1587794085.0,"I don’t think so. They said in their official guide that each personality actually has two variations. That could be why they act slightly differently.
It could also be that stitches is just randomly awake this one time. I’ve had some of my villagers getting up extra early or staying up extra late, and when this happens they actually comment on that"
ac_newhorizons,foiqmdq,t1_foip4da,1587793901.0,That is cool! I’ve heard people saying their villager jus randomly moved to their friend‘s island but I’ve always assumed the game just acknowledge that they know you somehow. I didn’t know they would actually have the furnitures and clothes you gave them!
ACTrade,fo58zii,t1_fo58a0u,1587520117.0,Interested! I have an extra Pear dress diy. Or I can bring some hybrid pansies!
ACTrade,fo3afx0,t3_g5al1b,1587483511.0,"[CLOSED] He stopped! Thanks all for stopping by :).

Leopold making golden armor shoes DIY. 
LF: cosmos seeds, lily seeds, NMT, but only if you have those and willing to spare some :). Not mandatory! I‘m trying to set up my flower garden and find a cat villager.

The other to his house is fenced off. Feel free to use the nook‘s though there’s nothing interesting there today. 

I am standing next to leopold‘s house but will be mostly AFK writing my report. Enjoy my island :)

Also, DIY next to nook‘s are free to take. Most of those are useless though.

ac_newhorizons,fo1oa5h,t1_fo15e4l,1587437689.0,"Maybe the island she landed on was on a Sunday? So the game counted her turnips as having experienced two Sundays, hence should have spoiled.

Also can confirm the date difference between islands doesn’t usually spoil turnips. I’ve travelled to my friend’s island constantly and her island is 15hr ahead of mine. So most of the time, I’d be going to an island on a different date. But I’ve never had this happen to me."
ACTrade,fnwg78e,t1_fnwfx57,1587317776.0,Ok Thanks!
ACTrade,fnwdsnb,t1_fnwc9jl,1587316463.0,"Can I come over? I can bring you a NMT. Also have the following spare DIYs for trade: light bamboo rug, basket pack, hyacinth crown, green-leaf pile, iron garden chair, pear dress, stacked-wood Waal, rustic-stone wall."

ACTrade,fnpm4x2,t1_fnoysyn,1587147922.0,Closed! He stopped. Thanks all for stopping by :)
ACTrade,fnoysyn,t3_g2x2q2,1587136165.0,"\[CLOSED\] Leopold is crafting ironwoodbed! Disclaimer: I don’t know when he‘d stop.

I‘ll be mostly AFK but will check occasionally.  Nook‘s upgrading, local time 8am as of now so I don’t know that the tailors have. His house is the one across the bridge to the ~~right~~ **LEFT** (sorry I'm horrible at left/right) of the map, on second level, above vending machines. Or you can check the map.

Flick is here. Not sure if you can interact with him.

There’s a bunch of DIYs and an item outside of the tailor, feel free to take what you need. You can also add to the pile if you want.

Seeds/plants for Roses, mums, lilies, cosmos appreciated but not necessarily. Regular ones are fine. Tips/randoms items appreciated. Please leave/plant those in front of the outdoor band.

Be nice to others! Limit time of your stay. Leave through airport. Don’t pick flowers or shake trees.

Dodo: ~~MQLW4.~~

Will update if I found out he’s stopped, or the game crashed or something."
ACQR,fnltznp,t3_fyqw8e,1587059696.0,Ohh thanks!! I was going to make my own for mine but now I don’t need to! Excellent work!
cats,fnjm3v2,t3_g25dcc,1587001859.0,"You are not doing anything wrong!! There are many cats who are strictly indoor cats and have enjoyed/is enjoying a long, happy, healthy life. The average Life span of indoor cats is longer than their indoor-Outdoor counterparts. If your cat is naturally an outdoor cat, then sure, you can let him/her out. But other wise, I‘d argue letting your cat go out unsupervised is a very irresponsible thing to do. 

For one thing, it is bad for your cat‘s health: you don’t know what he/she could have eaten when he’s out alone, you don’t know what plant he could come into contact with while he’s out alone, he could be run over by a car, he could be taken by a coyote, he could get into a fight with another cat and get injured, he could got caught by a psycho and tortured, etc, etc.... my cat got out once and caught a bad allergy reaction. She had a rash and lost patches of hair. We had to take her to the vet, and was informed we were „lucky“ in the sense that she could have caught something a lot worse than that (ear mite, flea, etc).

Also, it is bad for your health. Just like you have no idea what disease your cat can contract while out and about, you also have zero idea of what your cat can bring back to your Home and pass it to you. Some parasite and diseases can pass from cat to human, especially with covid19 out there and reports of tigers and lions catching the disease, it is a really bad idea to let the cat go out on their own and come back cuddle with you in your bed.

Lastly, it is bad for the other animals in your area. Cats are marvelous/notorious killers. The oatmeal has an excellent comic talking about this, see [here](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/cats_actually_kill) . They don’t just kill mites and rats. They kill birds and rabbits too. Cats killing birds is a big problem in New Zealand to the point they actually considered banning them. That’s just an example on how bad it could be to let your cat out.

So if your cat isn’t naturally thrilled about the outside world, there’s no reason why you should force/encourage your cat to go out. Especially if you are not comfortable to do it. Let them out in the garden and/or out for a walk on the leash is good enough."
ac_newhorizons,fnixk56,t1_fniq3qg,1586988145.0,"Be patient. It‘s been the same way for me until today. Prior to today, they‘ve just changed the available colors for me once in a while. But today they actually changed a type of flower."
ac_newhorizons,fnhjrfs,t1_fnhee6e,1586963693.0,"I just got a new type in mine today. I was under the impression it will always be the same 3 types too, but I guess they rotate the seeds every now and then."
ac_newhorizons,fn8jeu1,t1_fn8g7r8,1586743010.0,"Yes! it is hard to navigate in some areas. My priority was to have easy access to my house, shops, and beach. I’ve found myself not waking to the other places very often, so it doesn’t bother me if they are a bit hard to navigate."

UCSD,fn11s73,t3_fynvyw,1586553076.0,"I’m pretty sure that’s not the case. You are billed  on a quarter-to-quarter basis, so there’s no way for them to charge you extra tuitions after you’ve graduated.

Besides, one of my former roommates was from Europe and he did his BS-MS program in 4 years.  He only paid 4 year’s’ tuition, but the last two years was very, very brutal..."
