Unemployment,fpfvock,t1_fpfv2ca,1588585254.0,"I only say I don‚Äôt have the time because I‚Äôm a full-time student and my class lectures are during the very narrow call window. I‚Äôve emailed, I have attempted to call at least 30 times, I‚Äôve used AskEDD, I‚Äôve even contacted my assemblywoman and she said she‚Äôll get back to me. I didn‚Äôt mean it to come off like my time is more valuable or whatever, I‚Äôm just pretty busy still."

ucla,fpe9f7h,t3_gcvuja,1588543007.0,Did the Big Dicks meme come from Dickson Court being dick-shaped or did we discover Dickson Court was dick-shaped after the fact?
ucla,fpc8592,t3_gclyjz,1588490875.0,"It‚Äôs probably screen-related but make sure you‚Äôre drinking enough water as well. It might be hard to gauge how long it‚Äôs been between sips, since the passage of time is really wonky rn! It‚Äôs helped tremendously with my headaches. Also use a pinch of pink salt if you have any to keep your electrolytes up!"

fasting,fpae1ol,t3_gc2uua,1588446225.0,"- Day 2 of a 3-day fast (although I might go longer if day 3 doesn‚Äôt absolutely suck)

- Planning on doing an integrated approach: Day 1, only water. Days 2 and 3, water and unsweetened non-caloric green tea. Days 4+ if I persist, add on 1 hour of walking per day.

Decided to do this fast because I‚Äôve put on about 7 pounds since quarantine started and I felt really shitty about it, especially since it felt like I was just about to break through my plateau. It threw my BMI out of the normal range, which I fought tooth and nail for all last summer. Fasting always seems to reset my taste buds so that I don‚Äôt crave highly processed junk food and don‚Äôt feel perpetually hungry.

I‚Äôm currently 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 162 (might be a little lower since I weighed myself pre-fast) and my lowest weight within the past year was 149. Trying to see if I can get back to that before my birthday at the end of this month, although it‚Äôs doubtful that I‚Äôll get to show it off. 

Day 1 sort of sucked, I‚Äôm not going to lie. Luckily I was able to lay in bed most of the day and write a paper for class, so I wasn‚Äôt super winded. Just kept thinking about food. I will say, I‚Äôm going to pay more attention to my electrolytes today because I had a splitting headache last night while I was trying to go to bed. I woke up this morning feeling pretty okay though!"

ucla,fp4rx9b,t3_gb9rea,1588305871.0,I am so incredibly sorry that this is happening to you. I really truly believe that you‚Äôll get through this my friend! My well wishes and hopes for your speedy recovery will be in my mind and in my heart üíô
