I also wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t change anything before this midterm, I just wanted to throw that idea out there too for others who are trying to formulate emails to reason with him."
UCSC,foxbyan,t3_ga1bfw,1588139449.0,I’m writing my own email right now :)) thank you for also writing one! Every little bit helps I hope we can convince him.
UCSC,foxbved,t1_foxb01l,1588139383.0,"Technically he didn’t... and it’s also not outlined in his syllabus it just says a “proctoring service” which could be anything. Additionally, he posted his syllabus in Week 3, meaning even if he had included it and we didn’t agree with it, yes we could have dropped the class, but what class can you switch into and catch up on when you have been out for 2+ weeks already. And even if I were to just say drop the class and not go into a different one, I’m no longer enrolled full time, meaning the 6 month grace period on my loans will start to be used up and that’s something I can’t afford right now, and probably a lot of other students can’t either. Not trying to be rude to you, this is just another thing I’m going to bring up in my email. I hope this helps other as well."
