videos,fp6il01,t3_gbienw,1588352959.0,"LOL. His neighbor is Jeff Lewis from Flipping Out?  That is amazing.

For those that don’t know, on his show Jeff was a very stereotypical Type-A personality who didn’t seem to always have a lot of fun. That was his reality TV show character so it was probably bumped up a few notches but I’m sure in real life he is about the polar opposite of MGK."
videos,fp6idnq,t1_fp6hhon,1588352859.0,He is indeed an expert and famous. It looks like it is Jeff Lewis who had a (reality) show on Bravo or some other station where he flipped houses.  He is a (fairy) big deal not just some nobody.
Sacramento,fp4kkd5,t1_fp4jfq2,1588301084.0,Don’t fucking bother man. He doesn’t want a real conversation. He just wants to play the victim.

If you don’t want to answer my question that is fine. Have a great day."
Sacramento,fp4g9jg,t1_fp4egvf,1588298398.0,"Ok. I am just trying to understand your point of view. You are fine with him punching the kid in the face and slamming his head into the ground? (Once again, this is a serious question. To me it seemed unnecessary. He had top mount and looked to outweighed him by at least 75 pounds.)

I would only be fine with that sort of force being used if the kid was posing some sort of imminent threat. I didn’t see that in the video but I understand that is relative."
Sacramento,fp4cw8y,t1_fp4ch8y,1588296366.0,"Sure. Smoking a joint (or even a tobacco product) while underage probably contributed too. 

Does that somehow mean what the officer did was ok?"

Coronavirus,foek5wr,t1_foe34vc,1587705920.0,"r/running is a great place to ask that question. I first “broke the seal” by signing up for a race and doing a training program. That gave me specific tasks instead of the more ephemeral “I should go for a run.”

Now that the seal is broken I find myself able to go back and do some running whenever I feel like it. Also, figure out what you need during runs. I listen to mashups, my wife listens to podcasts, my other friend likes silence.  Figure out what works for you and it will help a LOT!"
DisneyPlus,fo81obo,t3_g5qyin,1587588325.0,I’m just impressed with the digital removal. Was there no blurring at all? That means they had the original footage to work with. Crazy.
Coronavirus,fo7ucl4,t1_fo6oby5,1587584691.0,"Just for the sake of clarity, I answered your original question, correct? You asked how other’s actions could possibly affect me while I am home and I told you an example. 

Now you are asking how likely it is that exact circumstance will happen, correct? The odds are just the same as every other day. Probably minimal.

Do you want another example? My sister is high risk and is staying at home. Her husband is “essential” so he has to work.  The more people that are out, the more likely there is community spread. The more likely there is community spread, the more likely he comes in contact with someone who has it. The more likely he comes in contact, the more likely he gets sick. The more likely he gets sick, the more likely my sister gets sick. If my sister gets sick, it is very likely she would have a very serious complications.  Her health is not insignificantly increased by the actions of others."
Coronavirus,fo5mhlt,t1_fo5lzwv,1587529375.0,Slip and fall? Heart attack? Lightning bolt? Broken arm? Car accident while picking up supplies? Same things that cause people to go to the emergency room on a regular basis.

But Dave’s first big TV appearance being against the brother of the co-creator of his show and it being totally unrelated is a pretty wild coincidence to me. Especially since many (most?) of the contestants probably peaked on the show.
