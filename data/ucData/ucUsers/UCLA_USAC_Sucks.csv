tbh the department's policy on lower div classes ain't making it any easier either"
ucla,fpf631e,t3_gd2snf,1588562670.0,"Thank you for the outpouring of support.  However, with all due respect, as an POC, female, and first-gen STEM student, I NEED to do well.  I need to do do well in classes so as to not disappoint my family, my community, and myself.  Especially my now-late grandparents, who immigrated here with very little in their pockets.  The grading system is absolutely fucking bullshit this quarter.  I'm just  angry and sad.  I feel like I'm not gonna make it."

We just don't want the stress of dealing with a harsh grading system as it exists now and are here to learn."
ucla,fpc3x1f,t3_gck03j,1588486786.0,"IDK how many times I'm gonna say this.  As an economics major, my econ 11 prof is a newb absolute garbage exam writer (at least he tries though) and I've heard horror stories about my friends taking 41 and 101 right now as glorified youtube videos.  PLEASE FUCKING CHANGE TO P/NP UCLA.  PLEASE.  MY GRANDPARENTS ARE LITERALLY DYING RIGHT NOW, MY WIFI CUTS OUT DURING EXAMS, AND MY PARENTS ARE FIGHTING.  Please help yo boi out.  Please.  I'm begging you."

Signing petitions and canvassing online won't do shit unless their money supply runs dry.  The only way moving forward is to de-enroll or declare non attendance en masse.  Otherwise, the Regents have their money and we have luxury car price Khan Academy video equivalents."

ucla,fossu07,t3_g9cfrw,1588037328.0,"Also econ; lower div profs are complete dog shit and for classes like 11/41/101, grades are VERY important"
