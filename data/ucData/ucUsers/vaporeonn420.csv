UCDavis,fpm9v9z,t1_fpkeuld,1588728530.0,Wait only upper division units overlap? So the 20% overlap doesnâ€™t include lower division units overlap?

Most of my finals were cancelled, so thank god or else I would probably have done bad in them. This quarter Iâ€™m taking about the same amount of units and Iâ€™m doing so terribly ////////////:"
