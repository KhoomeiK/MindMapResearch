UCSC,ecadm5o,t1_ecaa4ad,1545439046.0,"It’s broken up into 2 five week sections. 

The first five weeks is how hip hop has progressed from its very beginnings in the 1970s through the 2010s (the present). The next part of the class consists of listening to music that’s more focused on specific subjects such as international music or music that speaks about the LGBTQ+ community. There’s some readings sprinkled here and there that aren’t too bad to read (there was one with Angela Davis and Ice Cube that’s wild). 

The midterm/final/2 papers are all super easy and straight forward! The prof will give you a practice midterm/final to practice on that’s almost exactly like the actual midterm and final. The papers have a topic you can choose to write about but I can’t remember exactly what they are, but they’re super simple and the prof will help you out if you have any questions or want feedback. 

In all, it’s a really laid back class that’s fun to go to if you’re at all interested in music or want to learn more about music. "
