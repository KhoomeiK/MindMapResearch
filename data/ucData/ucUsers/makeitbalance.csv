UCSantaBarbara,fobwui6,t3_g6r5eg,1587664553.0,"a few things:

the math itself is not really what‚Äôs difficult about econ classes. it is moreso the concepts that are associated with the math. the most stressful part about the econ major is achieving the 2.85 GPA requirement in pre-major classes (ECON 1, 2, 10A)

the economics major at UCSB is not a business major, but it will land you a lot of the same job opportunities, and likely more than a management major. to be completely honest, business management is not a very marketable major, but SDSU does have a good business program just like UCSB has a good economics program. we also have the Technology Management Program which allows you to earn a certificate through courses like marketing, persuasion & sales, management, etc

tons of companies come to UCSB to recruit students for internships and full-time positions, mainly companies from LA, SD, and the bay. majoring in economics will not prevent you from landing a job in the business sector by any means.


SDSU and UCSB have two very different campuses in very different locations. you should check both out and make a decision based on which one you like more, because both will give you good opportunities. i‚Äôm from san diego and was admitted to both schools after majoring in Business Administration at CC, but i immediately fell in love with santa barbara and am very glad i picked this major. BUT if what you want is a pure business program, UCSB does not have that"

SLO and UCSB are in two very different areas. i think the choice will become clear once you check both of them out. they‚Äôre only about 1.5hrs away from each other too, so you could always visit your friends or your friends could visit you if you choose to come to SB.

i know a good amount of people that go to UCSD. it‚Äôs in a nice area for sure but it‚Äôs an old community and there are a lot of social restrictions. i have had a couple friends from UCSD visit santa barbara and they say they wish they went to UCSB lol


job opportunities are plentiful at UCSB, also. don‚Äôt listen to that other commenter. companies come from all over to recruit UCSB students (especially LA and SF) and there‚Äôs a very good chance you will have a job offer before you graduate, provided you put in some effort.

since the struggle didn‚Äôt really come from the quantity of information but instead the application of a relatively small amount of material, i think you will be fine taking it over summer as long as you practice.
