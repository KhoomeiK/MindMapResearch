It’s exactly like seeing in the real world but with the opacity turned down but obviously not with my eyes so I can still see in the real world while I’m visualizing. This is most evident when reading- I can still see the words on the page and I’m reading them but I get so involved with the images in my head I forget they’re there and I’m totally absorbed by the visual imagery, almost like I’m there and not just reading. 

Most of the time my visualization is involuntary. That’s not the case for everyone, my mother can visualize very well but chooses not to so she’s a very fast reader. When I think about something it’s always visual, whether I’m trying or not. Even just typing this brings up images.

So I ask “are you Skai Jackson?” And she says yeah. And god help me, all I could do was laugh. I don’t know why I did it, I don’t know why I didn’t say anything after. But that’s all I did. And then I went back to reading. My parents were PISSED."

But I would like to note that they didn’t have a contract signed by the end of the first movie. In fact I don’t think Ana ever signs the contract. They just had a safe word in place. And Christian already does a bunch of creepy abusive shit that would probably violate the contract if not explicitly then in spirit if it was signed anyway.

EDIT: just to add to my first paragraph since I realized I didn’t give much context, she was described as a nightmare to work with because she literally wouldn’t let stuff that needed to be changed to make the story better get changed. The books are written as fan fiction originally which means the author writes it usually weekly chapter by chapter without a lot of thought to narrative structure. This doesn’t work well for novels or movies, hence changes needed to be made. 

The only reason the second and third movies got made was because the studio hired her husband as one of the writers and fired the two women who worked on the first movie."

One of the writers for the first movie actually suggested that Christian not stop when Anastasia used her safe word at the end of the first movie since she freaks out and breaks up with him anyway and it would have been a good scene characterization wise but the author flipped her shit and screamed at the writers for an hour in front of the whole cast and crew so no go."
