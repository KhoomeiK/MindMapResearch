ucla,fphomyz,t1_fphk7sn,1588624977.0,"The [Election Code](https://96b7a0d8-9741-4cad-9213-4f1e4396c386.filesusr.com/ugd/85d9e4_9e7d9a2767b044879f93f819a5287c83.pdf), Article XII (page 45), has details on vote tabulation. General Representatives use single transferable vote and all other positions use instant runoff, but the two systems are very similar.

In both voting systems, if your first-choice candidate is eliminated during the ballot counting process, your vote is transferred to your second-choice candidate. If you do not have a second choice candidate, your vote doesn't count for anyone. As a result, I encourage you to **rank all the candidates you support, but don't rank the candidates you oppose** (unless you believe that certain candidates you oppose are better or worse than others).

ucla,fphk45c,t1_fphejex,1588622682.0,"The [Social Media Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14-zQud4NvevJtLeuqGPG0eyQfH835tg-7mpMu5DjP1k/edit) for campaigning, Regulation 2.1.a.i, state that campaign literature cannot be sent to email lists that all students are required to subscribe to.

Campaigning is defined in the [election code](https://96b7a0d8-9741-4cad-9213-4f1e4396c386.filesusr.com/ugd/85d9e4_9e7d9a2767b044879f93f819a5287c83.pdf), section 8.2.1.a (page 27) as:

> [A]ny effort by any individual or group to influence the decision of any student in support of or against any USAC candidate, slate, initiative, referendum, recall, or constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot in the next election through the use of verbal or nonverbal interaction, electronic correspondence of any kind, or the use of physical materials.

I believe this is a gray area. The email is allowable if Robert is making a nonpartisan announcement against racism, and does not express support or opposition to a referendum. Navi, who chairs the Elections Board, signed the email thus expressing his approval.

That said, if you believe a violation of the Election Code has occurred, the Elections Board website (below) has a report form.

ucla,fp4lldm,t1_fp3mls7,1588301737.0,"I respect their goals of helping out marginalized communities on campus. However, particularly for the CUB referendum, I do not believe that such a large increase in student fees during this pandemic is appropriate.

I’ve stated that I’m a big proponent of efficiency. $15 per quarter for all 31,000 UCLA undergraduates ($1.4 million yearly) is a lot of money, which makes me question how efficiently they will use all these funds. I would like to learn more about the other options they considered and why they think increasing fees by $15 per quarter is the best possible plan, but until I hear convincing evidence, I’m voting no.

Remember, though, that all of you will ultimately decide whether this referendum gets approved or not. So make sure you vote!"
