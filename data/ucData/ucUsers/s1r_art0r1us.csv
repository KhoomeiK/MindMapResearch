ChemicalEngineering,fp6qqfm,t1_fp6kpdr,1588356955.0,In the old days they would cut out a plot and weigh it compared to weight of a known area to calculate area under the curve. A Levenspiel plot is what you’ll need.
ChemicalEngineering,fozd0lo,t3_gadazk,1588188605.0,I think that’s pretty normal. Maybe you could review reports from the Chemical Safety Board. It’ll help you bring in “real world experience” to any safety discussion with some serious credibility. And walking around the plant and asking questions of operators/engineers about the function of some things is a good way to kickstart some of the concepts you learned but may not have had to apply.
UCSantaBarbara,fojt33u,t3_g7iotp,1587828809.0,Just imagine how it feels when all the classes for your major are easy. Nice GPA but didn’t learn anything.
ChemicalEngineering,fog0149,t1_fof9b8s,1587745786.0,Great book! Have it on my shelf at work and still use it as a reference.
engineering,foej33k,t3_g6sexn,1587705091.0,"Josiah Gibbs for chemical engineering. 5th PhD granted in the US, and a founding father of thermodynamics."
CoronavirusCA,fo1tce5,t3_g55xsz,1587441043.0,CA data looks like testing is getting better. Suspected cases is going down but confirmed COVID-19 is up. Both are much better than a line going straight up!
ChemicalEngineering,fnis1l0,t3_g1zbcf,1586985360.0,Yikes! Need some valve labels and a good P&ID
AskEngineers,fnelw9g,t3_g17dpk,1586891700.0,Install new high purity components for redesign of vacuum line for HF condensation and transfer and setup a production process.
UCSantaBarbara,fmfgvp7,t3_fuw1kk,1586026979.0,"I had no loans leaving UCSB. About 45% was paid with scholarships, 25% with savings from my parents, 20% parent out of pocket, 5% other family members, and 5% my own out of pocket."
