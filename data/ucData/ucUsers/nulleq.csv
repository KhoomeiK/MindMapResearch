berkeley,fpdyxkt,t1_fpd18io,1588537026.0,"> Mat-mul is the bottleneck here. There are crazy ways to do Mat-mul which will speed it up. Look up Strassen's algorithm if you want to reduce your runtime from O(n\^3) to O(n\^2.58)

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. OP don't do this. The O(n\^2.58) hides the crazy multiple in front. 61C is not an algorithms course.

The easiest speedup is to re-order the loops to benefit from better cache locality from the row / column orderness of matrices."
NotionSo,foxuwwq,t1_foxsdo9,1588157127.0,">Yeah, but someone is putting in hundreds of unpaid hours to get it to a usable state (and before they can make any money off a open-source project).

This is arguably what happens with most projects, open source or not. See Typora or Inkdrop as examples.

>So you mean open it up now for help?

It'd be useful for community feedback on what people want out of an API, and also helpful for people already building on top of Notion."

I actually think Notion would benefit from Open Source considering how many people are already trying to hack add-ons and CMSs on top of Notion even without an official API."

berkeley,fooi1ks,t1_foofc2z,1587939360.0,"That's a pretty individual decision. Ask yourself what hobbies or free time activities you enjoy; and then search for clubs in that area. For example, if you like tennis, join a recreational tennis club. If you like chess, join a chess club. Etc."

discordapp,foo76d9,t1_fonfw3i,1587933828.0,Confused by what you're trying to do in the gif. Does [https://www.slatejs.org/examples/richtext](https://www.slatejs.org/examples/richtext) have the same problem?

berkeley,focpkab,t1_foc8cu4,1587674191.0,"That's a different argument of what should be the rules (what constitutes cheating) as opposed to what should be the punishments. Here, if understanding course policies and what is defined as cheating, and then signing a pledge of academic integrity, was all part of the [first homework](https://www.eecs70.org/static/homeworks/hw0-sol.pdf), then the punishment makes sense since there is no ambiguity.

Note that the example you brought up, does not count as policy violation in certain cases:

>Erin finds a solution to a homework problem on a website. She reads it and then, after she has understood it, writes her own solution using the same approach. She submits the homework with a citation to the website.   
  
>  
>No, this is not a violation of course policy. Using external sources to help with homework problems, while less encouraged than peer collaboration, is fine as long as (i) the student makes sure to understand the solution; (ii) the student uses understanding to write a new solution, and does not copy from the external source; and (iii) the student credits the external source."
berkeley,fo8ip73,t1_fo8cbrn,1587597321.0,My controversial take: just don't cheat and you'll have nothing to worry about. This policy of broadcasting that a cheating scandal has occurred and that guilty students should turn themselves in isn't limited to classes taught by Sahai; it's happened multiple times through the lower and upper div CS classes I've taken. The difference is that Sahai has stronger rhetoric about the consequences of cheating.
