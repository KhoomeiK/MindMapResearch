both groups here DO NOT LIKE THE POLICE. Do you need me to explain why black people tend to not call the cops for stuff? 

Do you know what's reliable? Word of mouth. AKA community, which seems to be a concept that's foreign to you. When an old gramps or granny gets attacked or beaten, they tell their family, and the news circulates quickly through the Chinese community in Chinatown, because everyone knows each other. 

Data and statistic can not be used to explain certain cultural behavior if the integrity of the data can not be verified. In this case, the only conclusion you can make is REPORTED CRIME GOES DOWN.

Why would reported crime go down? See again-- you're are not from the Bay Area. People here do not trust the cops. It takes hours for police to respond. Over the years, peoples' trust in law enforcement erodes. Just like after the Oscar Grant killing. 

Why do I know this so intimately? I am a local. I have lived in over 6 cities in the Bay Area over 22 years. I get to know my community that I live in.

A bullshit claim. First of all, crime statistics don't fucking matter.

1. Marginalized AA, the chinatown grannies and grandpas do not speak much English. They do not call the police. This is due to cultural perceptions about not wanting to seek help combined with the Chinese notion of ""saving face"". Many crimes go unreported and unnoticed.

Coronavirus,fpdx24p,t1_fpdo3ou,1588535956.0,"NYC got fucked because they didn't shut down early enough.

Bay Area is very much OK and thriving and set up for a successful reopen in June, because one of the doctors here pushed SF leadership to do a shut down early. Too bad SoCal is full of low IQ mouth breathers. Good job owning 40k/50k cases."

bodybuilding,fpduu5p,t1_fpdik2u,1588534687.0,"deads are fucking GREAT for back. Are you aware that back is more than just lats?  what are spinal erectors, traps, rhomboids.

Like have you ever seen a guy pulling 500+ that didn't have a thick lower back?

How the FUCK does this comment have POSITIVE upvotes. Most bb programs always add some form of deadlift (stiff, roman, conventional). This sub has gone to shit.

jesus christ people like you SHOULD NOT be doling out advice."
bodybuilding,fpduiyn,t1_fpdhcgf,1588534506.0,"I am surprised that you got to a 4+ plate pull while thinking lats translate to pull strength. Yeah you need to flex your lats with your  set up, but pulling is a primarily a hip hinge at the bottom, and traps at the top. Lats are only there for stabilizers.

Anyways, if you want to be better at pull ups you need to do more pullups. I didn't do much pullups in my gym workout, but since lockdown started, all I do for back are pull ups and band rows. Went from 12 to 25 PR in 6 weeks."

bayarea,fpdh6jz,t1_fpdg4hn,1588526911.0,"Wrote a previous comment—

stuff like banning cockfights is akin to how California banned stuff like nunchucks and bo staffs during late 19 early 20 century. 

If the rules are gonna be applied be consistent. It’s an indisputable fact that most roosters in cock fighting rings are treated like royalty. It’s super popular in Philippines and Mexico. 

America is famous for making laws to punish marginalized people, while white rich people are immune.

Does that give my comment more context?"
bayarea,fpdf5dj,t1_fpdamjd,1588525776.0,"Lol that’s a bit of a far stretch to imply that. Don’t have the time to write why, but stuff like banning cockfights is akin to how California banned stuff like nunchucks and bo staffs during late 19 early 20 century. 

It’s not about animal cruelty here— why aren’t the same rules being applied to factory farms.

Ain’t an animal activist either I love eating meat"
