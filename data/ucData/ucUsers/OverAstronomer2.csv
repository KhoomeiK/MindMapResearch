UCI,fo8wk9v,t3_g6bxzy,1587605345.0,"I think what they mean is much like the current housing situation for dorms, people will be placed into single rooms in order to accommodate for social distancing, meaning dorming will be available ATM, granted following social distancing policies. What this means is that there physically aren't enough dorm rooms for every single freshman to have their own room. Additionally, since our school has new towers with more private bathrooms with bathrooms shared between rooms, while the older dorms have bathrooms shared with an entire hall (i.e. not connected to the room), everyone will have to dorm in the towers as single rooms. In terms of freshmen vs rooms, there aren't enough rooms for each student to live in a single meaning yes, dorming is an option, but no longer are you guaranteed. However if Fall Quarter is offered online, some freshmen will choose not to dorm and if you choose to, you will probably get a single dorm room."
UCI,fo5f7vu,t1_fo5ebup,1587524199.0,"The situation for you can be worse, there's nothing beneficial towards being cynical and hating your home, enjoy every moment and make the best out of bad situation. Being mean and rude during this pandemic does nothing but create a more cynical world, by being positive and joyful will make the world a happier place while we face the uncertain."
UCI,fo4zb9g,t1_fo4z40o,1587514204.0,"I understand, sorry I was confused makes sense, then yeah BELIEVE in yourself and your abilities and that's why you got in. Who cares what others think, you do you bro."
UCI,fo4z671,t3_g56raz,1587514122.0,Respondus does something to my camera that completely eliminates it from my laptop until I restart or shut down. This makes it so Respondus can't find my webcam when taking the exam so I literally had no idea how to fix it so I had to take it on my other laptop that was older so I don't like Respondus.
UCI,fo4yw1z,t3_g5ith1,1587513958.0,"Bruh you have to be friends with some persons who are current RAs. Theres no decision process, its a popularity contest. Just get buddy buddy with some current RAs. That's it."
UCI,fo4yr79,t1_fo4jxhg,1587513880.0,"By International, do you mean your friend was implying your race/ethnic background, because international means you applied from a different country and will be moving here to attend school and will be paying a very expensive tuition."
UCI,fo4yk1o,t3_g5md7w,1587513764.0,"It may have played a role, but ultimately this is the exact reason they keep these decisions hidden. If they release it, they are at risk for getting sued. I firmly believe that you got in based on your academic success alone and that's what you should think as well. On a blank canvas, keep faith in yourself and if your friend can't admire you for your worth, then they are not your true friend."
UCI,fo4yc70,t3_g5ksom,1587513633.0,"Bruh Disney is hella expensive and not super close. Especially since there's really shi\*ty public transportation in Irvine, Disney ain't possible without a car. Weather wise is amazing here, I love Irvine weather its an average of 80 year round with some exceptions exceed 90 degrees."
UCI,fo4y3r0,t1_fo4hber,1587513497.0,"Please do not be cynical for staying at home, be grateful for what you do have, your health,and a roof over your head during this troubling time."
UCI,fo4xzlm,t3_g5mvto,1587513433.0,"It too soon to say, but I mean until we get mass immunizations via Vaccine or other method, we cannot forgo social distancing and other safety precautions we are currently taking because schools like UCI are home to international, interstate and intercity students meaning even 1 student with the virus in the fall could cause something severe. Universities more so than any other kind of institution are at risk for another wave just based on how many people we each interact with directly or indirectly. At work, you only interact with those you work with within the vicinity of the company, while at school you literally walk among random individuals, any of which might have the virus. Again we are not the highest demographic for dying from it, but again the young people must stay healthy in order for hospitals to remain not busy in order to take care for people who need a lot of attention."
UCI,fnrjx95,t3_g3ihnf,1587191306.0,"Might recommend pushing all your GEs to Summer of 2020, seeing as your already paying for WR 39C, might as well do the pay for 8 and get in your 16 units at the cost of 8. Since all courses are online, try n find the easiest GEs as to not overwhelm WR 39C."
UCI,fnrjs1a,t1_fnnz4c2,1587191164.0,"Thats so sh\*tty tbh, ACC is really an arse for requesting money from the Uni in order to let us break our leases. That's really upsetting, the one thing I was really happy about this quarter was the fact that ACC was about to lose quite a bit of money, but I guess they aren't which is truly upsetting ACC will never learn. And even with this ACC will increase rent next school year due to ""COVID-19"" related losses :(."
HIMYM,fnrgjke,t1_fnol57w,1587188289.0,"Stella was a horrible person, the fact that she was going to force Ted to move to Jersey, but then moved to New York with Tony. TBH in the fantasy sequence where Ted tells Stella off should have been included, Ted was left at the altar. It is one thing to sit face to face and call off the wedding, but to run off from the wedding, DURING THE WEDDING, is a terrible move, no matter what. Cold feet does happen, but what doesn't happen is leaving a man at the altar having then to explain to literally everyone at his OWN wedding that his wife ran off and not just run off, but run off with her Ex husband. Also the Wedding Planner movie was distasteful, Stella was the real villain not Ted, nor Tony."
UCI,fnjcmmb,t3_g23zd3,1586996279.0,"Bruh UCI is a business at heart and with the corona virus situation, UCI is hemorrhaging money via lost rent from ACC (say what you will UCI most definetely has ownership in ACC in some shape way or form in terms of stakeholdership), lost money from shops and food on campus and on UTC. The government is giving UCI the money cause otherwise UCI would die. You think one dollar of that 39 mill is going to us students, HA no, that money is to help the business that is UCI."
UCI,fnetqrm,t1_fjcdfph,1586895696.0,"screw you, guess you should've been more careful, fearmonering my a\*\*"
UCI,fn84dbo,t3_fzocq0,1586733644.0,"HA you think the government gave that money for students LMAO, UCI and all other colleges rn are hemoragging money from the lost income on the rent, the food shops and other things that college students would be paying for if they were living at College. Please none of us are going to see one cent of that money, its going directly in Gillman's pocket."
UCI,fkv9un9,t3_fkr2tl,1584564950.0,"If you are staying, please move out of ACC and find cheaper housing elsewhere, ACC exploits students and this is our chance to ""revolt"" against them. Even if you are deciding to stay, don't stay at ACC housing please."
