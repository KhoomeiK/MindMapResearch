TheSilphRoad,fpl3dz2,t1_fpl2yhv,1588705657.0,I thought whiscash was expensive too but it's also a 10k second move.
TheSilphRoad,fpl2bpd,t1_fpl1n4b,1588705126.0,"Altaria needs to be around lvl 26-30 and costs 10k for second move. Same applies to the starters. Building a whole team in GL could easily cost less than a single second move for Masters.

I hear you, but if you don't want to be left out there are very cheap options."
TheSilphRoad,fpl0hwm,t3_ge3f22,1588704221.0,You don't have any swablu? Marill? Barboach? Hoppip? Jigglypuff? Community day pokemon? Hell even hoothoot or zigzagoon?
ucr,fphvd64,t3_gdjwnt,1588628496.0,I don't disagree with you but god damn 15k a quarter?
Costco,fpgt4e5,t1_fpfq9nk,1588609031.0,"If you read the paper by the WHO you'd note they tested particulate that made it to the other side of the mask and not necessarily made it airborne. They swabbed both sides, the mask was never meant to be touched on the front where it was swabbed on the outside. People need to learn how to read papers carefully because typically they do mention important flaws that could undermine the entire study, like this one."
Costco,fpf2cih,t1_fpf18i1,1588560162.0,"And the CDC recommends wearing cloth masks. But we all pick the evidence that's supports our narrative.

Costco,fpbh9fp,t1_fpbguej,1588469970.0,It's honestly such a pain in the ass to cook the breast in a way that I can enjoy. But with the limited shopping runs I decided to grab a bag of frozen breasts just in case and I found sauce heavy dishes have been amazing like oyakudon and tiki masala. Or just beat it senseless and go the fry route.
Costco,fpasm5w,t1_fpar7ft,1588454857.0,"He's right, if someone gave me a chicken breast I might cry a little. Everyone know's the thighs are what us millenials like."
ucr,fp8p2io,t1_fp8ou3a,1588398467.0,Oh fuck I found it. You just made my night.
ucr,fp8o1pv,t1_fp8nntc,1588397609.0,You're very right. Their averages may be similar.
ucr,fp8is1l,t1_fp8i879,1588393382.0,"It was an email to grad students. Itll be the 6th post on the ""hot"" tab."
ucr,fp8hrzv,t1_fp8hbhe,1588392638.0,"I kinda dont understand where that $1200 came from. $14.8 mil divided by 24k students is like $600 each. Then they stated they will be allocating 14% of the overall funding to grad students so the grad student average grant is much higher than the undergrad average grant.

Edit: they got that $1200 by assuming all $30 mil would be dispersed to students. Which of course it was not."
ucr,fp8g2ri,t3_gbzpa2,1588391392.0,"I think a lot of people were also misled on reddit from a comment that said ""$700 minimum"". This was never said in any official statements and now some may have been relying too much on the average that was predicted to be dispersed"
ucr,fp8993c,t1_fp85hs6,1588386691.0,Same question. It wont even ley me view the aid year
ucr,fp7m87e,t1_fp7b4ty,1588373289.0,Were there any stats on what grad students got? If it was any different?
ucr,fowwqfz,t1_fowlxyi,1588128803.0,"I agree the statement ""700 minimum"" is a little optimistic. Who knows how/if it'll be dispersed. Still spending $700 regardless"
ucr,fow66vg,t1_fow5o4d,1588113753.0,Top tier comment. Hopefully this gets recognized and those that did get the email can confirm they didn't have direct deposit set up.
ucr,fow1ku8,t1_fow19ng,1588111326.0,"Just like OP I'm super skeptical of the email let alone actually receiving any amount of money over $12 from the school.

Thank being said, I will still fuck up and spend $700 like it's already in my account."
espresso,foh8zk5,t3_g7fb92,1587762025.0,Little did they know Biosphere 2 only failed because there wasn't good espresso to complete the balance
ucr,fo4vk13,t1_fo4py09,1587512058.0,"10/10 vent. Although this is a real pain and probably upsetting to some, it is important to make sure you don't stress too much over the things you can't control. Also, love you too."
ucr,fo3vyq0,t3_g5jmmo,1587493862.0,"I agree. This whole situation is tricky, and I really wonder about the out of state/country students who may be on to their next steps in life by the time we hold our commencement."
ucr,fnplstf,t3_g2oahe,1587147751.0,"Maybe I'm just bad at reading, but I have yet to see anything announcing a full on cancellation. Last I saw the counsel was submitting options on the 15th.

Would you be able to link me to where it says commencement has been cancelled? Thanks!"
ucr,fnfhlj3,t1_fnfhawz,1586908200.0,Can't see em therefore they don't exist.
TheSilphRoad,fn96rff,t1_fn951qi,1586761396.0,There are so many togekiss leads at 2100ish that I can tell if I'll get one or two blaze kick off based on the first charm. We need more viable options for sure.
ucr,fn1w423,t1_fn1ugha,1586571522.0,I'm a fucking moron actually. But thanks!
ucr,fn1smgz,t1_fn1rdsc,1586569155.0,"I'll focus on the polygamy part since that's what you're focusing on.

Latter-day saints historically practiced polygamy, and although not a large percentage, it was a notable portion that would practice this. In our current time, polygamy is practiced by less than 1% of mormons, but a majority of their population is in Utah. I was linking the high rate of Mormonism and polygamy to Utah. Which is why I said ""Oscar"" should move to Utah, because this is where there is both a stereotypical affiliation as well as some historical background of polygamy. Hence, why ""Oscar"" should move there, so all of the women that love him oh so much for his online-protection, could also marry him. I did not make note of the bylaws or any logistics if marrying multiple women because those facts are not humorous in this context.

Hopefully this clears it up!"
ucr,fn1eof0,t1_fn1dznc,1586560444.0,I can explain the joke if you'd like.
ucr,fn0v1sx,t3_fym1li,1586549295.0,"You can tell this guy fucks OFTEN. I mean honestly, he's gonna have to move to Utah so he can legally attain all the wives he's acquired from all this unprecedented online defending. Never change my guy."
Costco,fmixpc8,t1_fmiaeui,1586119013.0,I have no dog in this fight. But I am somewhat confused to what the problem is. Please don't shame me
