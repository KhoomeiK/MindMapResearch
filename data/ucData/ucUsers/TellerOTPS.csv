OnePiece,fpfegm2,t3_g9h5is,1588568867.0,I hope we never get spoilers this early again. This comment section has devolved into a bunch of ‚Äútheories‚Äù with no basis such as Sasaki being Jimbei‚Äôs brother or just jokes about Gin (admittedly some of them are hilarious)
OnePiece,fpevv3g,t3_gd1odc,1588556064.0,"Mostly because they don‚Äôt sign up with the intention of protecting the World Nobles, they do it to fight for peace, much like how people in the real world who choose to join the armies of their respective countries don‚Äôt do it to fight for their corrupt governments, they do it to defend their homelands or fight for peace for themselves and others (even though it‚Äôs an arguably misguided way of thinking... not trying to get really far deep into the ideology of war)."

OnePiece,fpbk923,t3_gbyssr,1588471940.0,"I get what you‚Äôre saying, but also keep in mind what Ace‚Äôs death means for his own story. 

In choosing to die the way he wanted (saving Luffy, defending Whitebeard‚Äôs honor) rather than executed on the platform, Ace was able to free himself from the burden of having his entire life being decided by others (whether that means being hunted down ever since he was in his mother‚Äôs womb, judged by others for being the pirate king‚Äôs son, used as a bargaining chip for warlord status, publicly executed by the government merely as a show of power, or hell, even having to rely on the Whitebeard pirates to save his life.) Everybody‚Äôs efforts to either condemn, kill, or save Ace (all things he had no control over) did not end up defining him in his final moments: he was able to choose the circumstances of his own death and therefore become free.

It‚Äôs very subtle since we did not have very much time with Ace before he died, but his character really did come full circle, and it‚Äôs beautiful if you really take a good look."

Pretty much, if that‚Äôs your only reason for not going with UCSC then don‚Äôt let it outweigh other preferences in different categories you might value since you‚Äôd definitely be able to work in industry right off the bat (at least, having attended UCSC wouldn‚Äôt prohibit you from doing so, and that‚Äôs the route a lot of people take).
