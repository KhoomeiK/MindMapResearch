As far as academics, a degree in engineering here is extremely prestigious and pretty much guarantees your future. UCLA is a worldwide known school; Cal Poly SLO, not so much. 

Plus, UCLA has a way better campus culture than SLO does, you’ll find UCLA more inviting and it tons more to do around campus. Not to mention, SLO’s food sucks. I highly advise you not to settle for Cal Poly SLO. Thats just my opinion though."
ucla,fphm7qh,t3_gdhuos,1588623746.0,"Just because I don’t want to spend my financial aid/loans on a referendum, doesn’t mean I am racist. It just means I’d rather spare the 50 dollars I’d otherwise have to pay per year.

That could be money I spend on textbooks, on transportation to see my family, medications, or food because I’m not even sure if I can get enough financial aid next year. As a former foster youth, my funds are extremely limited- I don’t have the money to freely spend, as some pro-CUB people try to say “It’s only 15 dollars a quarter...” With all the stupid fees we already have to pay with no benefit, another one just doesn’t appeal to me. If others want to pay, sure! But ME? I can’t afford that. 

Everyone has their reasons to vote “no” on CUB Referendum. Associating someone saying “hey, I don’t really have the money to do that” with the idea that they are racist is so ass backwards and hypocritical of what the CUB Referendum is supposed to stand for about inclusion on campus.

EDIT:

If the GCGPBN Referendum was 15 dollars a quarter, I would vote No too. *Many times, and some people need to understand this- the reason we do something is not because we hate others, but because we are trying to save money. It’s purely financial. Those of us who vote no on CUB don’t have a vendetta against you. We just can’t afford it.*"

However, not even the students who chose their exact room know where they are going, because UCLA Housing cancelled our housing contract guarantee."

AskReddit,fnyp8yr,t1_fnxe7nx,1587370562.0,"When I was in high school, we had a “career day” where people from different careers came to present their careers and what they do. A forensic analyst came in, and told us he worked on many cases and worked with many detectives/police departments, including cases like JonBenet and a few others.

I asked him what he personally thought happened, and he confirmed he thought that the parents were 100% involved. He, as well as the entire team he worked with, believes that the parents were involved, and the brother knows about it. But due to lack of CONCRETE evidence, they could never really make a claim- it was based on evidence that was “common sense.”"
ucla,fnxm4jh,t1_fnxlhd7,1587341518.0,"I did back in winter quarter and it ended up fine- it’s how I got my MacBook. What I did is went to the UCLA store, had the computer put on my BruinBill and then the Financial Aid office reimbursed me the money once I showed them the receipt as a refund- like paying housing. 

But because of the coronavirus, I recommend you send them a screenshot of your cart and combine it as one PDF with your application. 

As far as it being a loan or not, I think it depends on your EFC, maybe? 

My EFC was 0 and I got fully reimbursed up to 2,000."

ucla,fnn1r9l,t1_fnmaz84,1587082572.0,"If you need a laptop you don’t need to rely on the BTG!! Have you heard of the budget increase request form? Basically, you go to [this website](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/Forms-and-Publications#495951591-2019-2020-academic-year-appeal-forms) and go under 2019-2020 appeal forms. Complete the Budget Increase Request form, and select “purchase of computer” as your reason to increase financial aid. Also, send them an estimate of your shopping cart online (save as a PDF) and what you would be buying. Compared to 1000 with the BTG, I believe you get a limit of 2000!!! Once that is over, they will give you the money you need via a refund of financial aid within a week or so. Best of luck, and update me if you continue with that!!! :)"

I wouldn’t doubt if more than just that one person did it, too.

More regulations are needed to prevent this, because I myself saw people who already had a MacBook before the BTG in line to get another one. Sad."
ucla,fnm7ysn,t3_g23hf6,1587066669.0,"I really think UCLA should have handled the BTG a LOT better. As someone said on another post, it should be for people WHO DEMONSTRATE FINANCIAL NEED. Not people who hear about it first. I saw a line literally out the door of the UCLA Store for the laptop, but I guarantee you, 25%, if not 50% of those people did not need it, and just finessed the system. Welcome to systemic failures!

Unfortunately, it’s common nowadays, *especially*  what I have seen with the Bruin Tech Grant, that people have been taking advantage of the system. 

If you need a computer, I suggest going to the Financial Aid website and requesting a budget increase using the Budget Increase Request form (should be on their website) and selecting “Laptop/Computer” as your need. 

I’m sorry this happened to you. Us folks with an EFC of 0 usually get taken advantage of, it’s just the way of the system I guess. :("
