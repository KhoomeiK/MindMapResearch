chess,fmz48r5,t3_fyb2j3,1586505788.0,"Being good at solving tactics puzzles does not equal being good at playing a chess game start to finish. You need to have a good opening knowledge base, solid positional sense/ strategy in the middlegame after the opening, ability to play endgames precisely, and above all that control your game losing blunders and have a keen tactical eye to be able to exploit any mistakes that your opponent makes. A good general rule is that if your opponent's position or last move doesn't feel right, and your pieces are well placed, you should probably be looking for a decisive shot. Otherwise, just continue improving your pieces."
