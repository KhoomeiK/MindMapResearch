Vivarium,fp1d69x,t1_fp0ucac,1588231599.0,"These like pretty dry conditions in my experience, and the thick succulent trunk stores water. They require good airflow and substrate with excellent drainage to prevent roots rotting. This doesn't really match tropical vivarium conditions.

With that said, I have seen them grow in Hawaii, so if you research the situation well maybe you could make something work."

IndoorGarden,fnykw6v,t1_fnyipmr,1587366288.0,"Several of mine are from the Violet Barn as well -- they do an excellent job. The rest I started from seeds from the Gesneriad Society. I don't know if you have done it, but they grow really slowly from seed compared to most plants. I think it's worth it though because you can get some really rare stuff and it supports a good cause.

It is indeed ""Salmon Sunset"". Very good eye! The one behind it is ""Wow"", but it isn't blooming at the moment. Streptocarpus have really impressed me with how they are almost constantly flowering.

Yes! I do know about repotting phals, but it is a good reminder nonetheless. :) When I first got each of them, I repotted in long fiber sphagnum and orchid bark. The roots were a mess. However, I just realized I never repotted the oncidium and that is probably why it isn't happy enough to rebloom. I will do that this week.

I'd love to try paphs! I think I'm intimidated by the more challenging orchids because I live in a desert climate with harsh winters and intense sunlight. It has been a constant fight to keep all my tropicals happy and the humidity up. Do you think 45-50% humidity is too low for a paph? I've always wanted to try a vanda orchid but there is just no chance I could keep it alive here without a greenhouse."
IndoorGarden,fnyhj74,t1_fnyghfb,1587363277.0,"And that's an awesome recommendation! I do love orchids, but so far only have phaelonopsis and one oncidium. The phaelonopsis rebloom between November and about now most years, but I have not gotten the oncidium to rebloom yet.

Do you have a lot of experience with orchids? If so, any tips, or species to try (in addition to paphiopedilum)? (The maximum humidity I can keep our house at is 50%, as the climate outside is quite dry.)"
IndoorGarden,fnyh0n4,t1_fnyghfb,1587362827.0,Thanks! Gesneriaceae is my favorite family. I wasn't sure if anyone would notice them amongst the more popular plants. Glad you did!
IndoorGarden,fnygqg1,t1_fnydzfl,1587362585.0,"Hahaha, oh no! This was a good way to explain the horror of painting walnut/maple/etc. to me. My spouse enjoys woodworking and I assure you he would never let that happen in our house (whether I notice what type of wood it is or not)."
IndoorGarden,fnyafal,t1_fny5inj,1587357491.0,"I'm stupid, they do just have a clear coat. I asked him and they are maple (not walnut). I know plants but not wood apparently, lol.

They just look painted because of the lighting!

2. Take a gallon of raw, filtered goats milk and gradually warm it to 80 F stirring continuously. 
3. Take the milk off the heat and add 2 drops of liquid rennet mixed in 1/4 cup of water.
4. Sprinkle in 1/8 teaspoon mesophilic culture and stir thoroughly.
5. Cover pot with saran wrap and let sit 12-18 hours or until it looks like yogurt (I did 13).
6. Line a colander with cheesecloth and strain out the curds. Let it drain naturally (about 4 hours)  until the texture is like cream cheese.
7. Mix in 1 teaspoon cheese salt and any seasonings you would like! (I mixed in crushed blackberries.)"
