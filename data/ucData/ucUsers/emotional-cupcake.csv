morbidquestions,fo2lmhn,t3_g5cyd8,1587467002.0,"actually? i know having someone you dont trust/dont feel comfortable with topping you can feel torturous. the pleasure pain brings has to build up. when you want to submit to a specific person, the more pain they give you and limits they push, the greater the euphoria feels. even if youre crying it’s cathartic. but when you dont want someone playing with you, your mind cant produce that euphoric sensation and it just feels awful"

antidepressants,fnd5dgn,t3_g0bxpn,1586859411.0,i feel like starting off by microdosing is a good way to test the waters
therapy,fn9ovvm,t3_g0b0zf,1586780591.0,"the only time a therapist has to break confidentiality, and they will tell you this before starting, is if you are stating that you WILL hurt yourself (i want to kill myself, i have a plan, im doing it on this day) , if you plan to hurt someone else, or there is unreported abuse going on (for example u talk about ur little sister being physically abused by ur parents) . 

my therapy session are over video calls now so sometimes ill smoke a cigarette. im 18 (legal age to smoke is 21). my therapist doesnt say anything. there is nothing ‘to report’ so you are safe to discuss your drinking . 

as for finding a therapist, you can ask your primary doctor how to be referred to see someone. tell them that you want to keep it ‘off the radar’ theres a teen privacy thing i believe. but until you turn 18 theres always the chance ur parents find out. i think its worth it if youre struggling and need the help."

you deserve to be heard and i hope you can find the comfort & voice to speak your mind. definitely find another therapist. best of luck"
Advice,fmtujes,t3_fxei1s,1586379250.0,"just the fact that youre questioning it tells me youre not ready to have a child - and thats completely okay and normal ! youre so young. i think you should plan things with the assumption that someone wont be taking care of you. so if living with him didnt work out or something were to happen, what would you be doing to take care of yourself? are you going to school ? getting a job ? etc etc

having kids can be awesome but once you feel safe and ready to do so. do you think you can emotionally & financially provide for a child right now? and do you believe he could do that as well? dont be afraid to let him know if you want kids but it’s something youd imagine happening in the future . please put serious thought into it because both of your decisions are going to shape that childs life"
