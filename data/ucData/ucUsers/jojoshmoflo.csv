ucr,fn1dznc,t1_fn0v1sx,1586560044.0,Polygamy is illegal in all 50 states. Not sure what you mean by “legally attain”.
NoStupidQuestions,fn16sy7,t1_fn16h9e,1586555929.0,"Ok mod, thanks"
CPA,fn15kpk,t3_fymor3,1586555237.0,They should let us test now wearing these. I wouldn’t even flinch at the chance.
CPA,fmzxxz6,t3_fyar2t,1586531776.0,CBA said for now they aren’t receiving any applications. They are shut down :(
PresidentialRaceMemes,fmt3dg2,t3_fx8w7b,1586366217.0,Glad to see the bastard out of the race
CPA,fmr22u5,t3_fwxp7m,1586312087.0,"I had simulations on my FAR exam that covered consolidations and intercompany transactions. I feel like Becker was enough to cover what I was tested on. If you need to supplement the explanations of the MCQ’s, I used Farhat lectures and he did a better job explaining things."
CPA,fmqldkp,t1_fmqkfc9,1586301902.0,Everyone is in the same boat. I think they will have to make up for the lost testing opportunities.
CPA,fmqlb0l,t1_fmqk8gk,1586301861.0,AUD and BEC are short enough that the total content between the two exams is like FAR or REG separately. Wouldn’t recommend studying for two at a time for the other sections.
CPA,fmq8py8,t3_fwt3wz,1586294979.0,This is a total game changer on so many levels.
CPA,fmq7vl4,t3_fwliuz,1586294519.0,"Stick with REG. Do some MCQ sets to keep it fresh, but you will forget everything once you move on to FAR."
CPA,fmq7frj,t3_fwo140,1586294281.0,"Basis inside and out for every type of corporation. If you are using Becker, Chapters 3-5 are the meat of the exam. Individual tax is fairly straightforward and there aren’t as many rules, just bulleted lists of details, so chapters 1 and 2 are easy to get through quickly. Blaw is important, but is tested very high level. You can rely on MCQ alone to drill in the most important concepts. Don’t get lost in the lectures that go way too deep into detail. Chapter 7 is important, Chapter 8 can be skimmed, just drill MCQ and know bankruptcy."
CPA,fmq4lq2,t3_fwqkex,1586292769.0,I’m stuck studying for AUD and BEC and I can only do the same MCQ’s over and over again so many times. It’s hard to keep it all fresh as I wait for the Prometric centers to open up again.
CPA,fmozk8q,t3_fw6sps,1586271563.0,"I’m glad they’re extending Q2 and bringing in continuous testing as a result of all this. I’m not ready to take the exam now anyway, so it’s nice to have the extra testing time open. Doing away with the windows is a total game changer too."
CPA,fmiausv,t3_fvgq2d,1586105891.0,Keep moving forward. I found it best to get through all the material at least once before going back to review.
