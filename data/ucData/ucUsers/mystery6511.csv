ncdinos,fpjf4e7,t1_fpjf2m6,1588666203.0,Agreed! Just happy that baseball is back!
ncdinos,fpjerz7,t1_fpjeqnc,1588665846.0,No problem man. Imma try and keep this place alive and well
baseball,fpjd579,t1_fpjczsm,1588664209.0,/ncdinos gotcha boss
baseball,fpjcn7u,t1_fpjckw4,1588663708.0,Yo that’s actually so sick. Hawaiian burger?
baseball,fpjb9ze,t1_fpjb5kv,1588662384.0,"Obvious stuff: no spitting, no crowds
Less obvious: shorter porches, not as juiced balls
What I like: it’s baseball
What I dislike: the broadcast"
baseball,fpj7pv9,t1_fpj7p9q,1588659097.0,Lmaooo
yugioh,fp4q8iy,t1_fp4nsr7,1588304727.0,"As said earlier, I haven't really kept up since Synchros. But it's great to know that HEROs are pretty good nowadays having received different archetypes WITHIN the archetypes (i.e. Evil HEROs, Masked HEROs, etc.)!

That being said, I'm just now getting introduced to Shaddolls and Invoked through Legacy of the Duelist: LE haha"
yugioh,fp4q0xx,t1_fp4nkfv,1588304588.0,"Which archetype that uses fusions is the most fun to play in your opinion? And which one is currently best in the meta? Also, I absolutely love your flair haha"
yugioh,fp4pvoy,t1_fp4n9m5,1588304489.0,That's awesome! I'm currently playing Legacy of the Duelist: LE to try and get back into the cycle of dueling. Seeing Prank Kids and Shaddolls are new to me but they seem like fun!
yugioh,fp4prs8,t1_fp4nhoi,1588304416.0,Thank you! Do you think pure Fusion decks by itself (as in no synchros/Pendulums/Links/XYZs/etc) are viable in today's meta?
yugioh,fp4pmwt,t1_fp4o9h3,1588304327.0,Would you mind telling me what it is and what its effects are? And is it probably going to be banned/limited in the near future?
yugioh,fp4pjtg,t1_fp4nja0,1588304272.0,"Wow! That's good to hear! I thought that after all of the changes the game has gone through, fusions would become obsolete.. It's nice to know that fusions are constantly being upgraded."

claremontcolleges,fnt64fn,t3_g3sds0,1587235344.0,CMC Parents Field
claremontcolleges,fnkikr7,t3_g1srjf,1587028411.0,"Although I attend CMC, I’d say that Pomona’s Math department is better. However, both schools are great choices and you can take math classes at any school you’d like to complete the degree. Pomona is a bit bigger as well. Though if you like to party (which shouldn’t sway your decision), CMC is the way to go!"
StarWarsBattlefront,fney6ir,t1_fne8g95,1586898017.0,"Probably Borderlands 3 (exclusive to the Epic Games Store) whereas the 1st and 2nd we’re both released on Steam. They made a last minute deal to be an Epic exclusive release like a month before release, which really killed the PC player base hype, at least for me."
claremontcolleges,fm288y2,t3_fsjsme,1585692409.0,"I play a sport for CMS at the moment. 

1. Balancing the school workload and practices is tough, but it depends on many other things as well (which school you attend, what major you are, which sport you play, etc.). I (as well as all of my teammates) have the utmost respect for anyone going to HMC AND doing a sport. For my particular sport, you have to invest about 3-4 hours a day in the spring whether it be for weight training or a practice. On the flip side, I invest maybe 6 hours per week during the fall semester and most of those hours are invested into the weekend for scrims and longer practices. 
2. You can definitely make time for it during the off-season, and occasionally during the season, but you better be prepared to organize your schedule well ahead of time because of schoolwork and practices. 
3. The D3 experience is what you make of it, honestly. Academics are definitely the priority at most of the colleges, and will accommodate you based on your academic schedule. You aren't ""technically"" required to be at practices, but try not to skip out on them. Same with games. 

If you'd like more specifics, then just PM me!"
