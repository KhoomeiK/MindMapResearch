TMJ,fpdqhap,t1_fpddcn6,1588532178.0,"I did it in the Bay Area, [here's a list of dentists that practice it](https://cnotmj.com/). I'd say it lessened the muscle tension by maybe 50%. That was (and still is) my main problem, the constant muscle tension (mainly in the temple area). You're right to look for practitioners that take the occlusion seriously, it's behind a lot (some would say a majority) of TMJ cases."
TMJ,fpc0o0s,t3_gci2v4,1588483931.0,"There is a treatment called DTR that works by making small adjustments to the teeth in order to reduce strain on the jaw muscles. I tried it, I still have a significant TMJ problem but it's a good deal better than it used to be. There's been a lot of work done with this treatment, with both patient testimonials and medical papers to back it up. It's not perfect, but from what I can tell it's the best treatment out there both in terms of efficacy and methodology (other methods are very ad-hoc in comparison). Please lmk if you have any questions."

TMJ,fnu0v27,t3_g3t2r6,1587252363.0,"DTR helped me significantly. I'd say it reduced my symptoms by about 50%. I still have a good amount of tension, but it's made a world of difference as far as productivity and mental state."
