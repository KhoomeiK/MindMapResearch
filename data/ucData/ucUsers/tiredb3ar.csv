berkeley,fkl4yh8,t3_fimk06,1584298579.0,"I'm a haas student and I just found out all that the Haas administration has allowed for courses to be attendance based again. For my classmates living in other countries, the time difference makes attendance to zoom classes difficult. Is there some way that major requirements can be waived this semester and give the students the option of a PNP grade?  In regards to tests, would it be possible to convert them to group assignments or group exams? This is because students, one way or another, will always figure out how to cheat on exams - wouldn't it be better to just convert them to group tests?

Personally, I've found it horrendously difficult to stay focused to study for my midterms and complete my assignments - I'm prioritizing saying goodbye to my senior friends and other friends whom I may not see for a long, long time."
