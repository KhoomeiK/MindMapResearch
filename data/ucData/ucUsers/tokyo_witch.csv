UCSC,fogy19c,t3_g7cwt7,1587758285.0,Me too! I think maybe itâ€™s the weather or I just got a good amount of sleep. Happy for us!
UCSC,focf07j,t1_foceman,1587670552.0,Thanks for explaining in detail! I really appreciate it so much :)))!
UCSC,fo9dk26,t1_fo9d3a3,1587616613.0,"Thanks, same to you!!"
CollegeRant,fo5d9t3,t1_fo5cg17,1587522899.0,"Thank you for this advice!! Iâ€™m definitely gonna look into other schools at this time, but I also think I really do need to take at least a semester off. Regardless, thank you so much. I really needed some kind of reassurance because it feels terrible"
StardewValley,fnqun54,t3_g3a576,1587172600.0,She gave me an ancient doll last Winter lmao
Dyshidrosis,fnhdlam,t3_g1rbvj,1586960361.0,"Iâ€™m in the same boat as you. Iâ€™ve never had my eczema become this bad on my hands before and Iâ€™m struggling to manage, but the one thing thatâ€™s really helping me right now (and helps on my feet too) is using a cold compress to soothe the itchiness. Another thing I like are really thick and creamy moisturizers. I get a lot of mine from Lush because theyâ€™re relatively inexpensive. I hope this works for you. Good luck!"
thebachelor,fn3qi6u,t1_fn393u9,1586625947.0,I was about to say this! The reason terrace house is such a success is because the culture in Japan is so different and you can really feel the authenticity of the contestants! If we had a terrace house in America I donâ€™t doubt that it would be absolutely butchered.
piercing,fn2amux,t1_fn2aiaw,1586582677.0,"Ugh yeah I was so terrified when I realized I had to wear a mask!!! But Iâ€™ll definitely start cleaning it twice a day and altering my mask, thanks so much for the advice!"
piercing,fn27zto,t3_fywnpx,1586580420.0,"My piercing is three months old, barbell, I use a saline spray once a day, and itâ€™s titanium. It wasnâ€™t this bad yesterday but I went out for groceries and wore a mask so Iâ€™m thinking thatâ€™s the problem. What should I do??? Thank you!"
thebachelor,fn1uaf0,t1_fn0yr08,1586570271.0,"Lmao, someoneâ€™s from the town where I went to high school !! Holy heck"
college,fmvq1kk,t1_fmvpo05,1586426467.0,"Great, thanks for the explanation. But I donâ€™t think most people are throwing a tantrum. As I said before, we arenâ€™t prepared for this, we didnâ€™t sign up for this. Even if someone did throw a tantrum itâ€™s justified. Secondly, a lot of people simply donâ€™t have the time to look up self discipline methods or read books. A lot of college students are still working and are stressed beyond belief. I get what youâ€™re saying, but come on. No need to subtly belittle people for being upset at how their routines have changed."
college,fmvp5fd,t1_fmvoxaz,1586425452.0,"As a former teacher, you should be more aware that people have different learning styles. Secondly, youâ€™re really making an effort to forget that these arenâ€™t just regular times. We are in a pandemic, in case you forgot. A lack of effort to adapt on external factors is more than understandable at this time and people shouldnâ€™t have to deal with the burden of adapting to an online course that they didnâ€™t sign up for. Sorry that youâ€™re stuck in a mentality that dictates that people are lazy or whiny for not being able to do something they arenâ€™t prepared for. Have more sympathy. Youâ€™re not better than someone because you have good self discipline. People are allowed to complain, you know."
college,fmvlb5r,t1_fmvjujg,1586421151.0,"I love khan academy but for some reasonI havenâ€™t looked at that for this class yet, but I definitely will! Thanks for the suggestion!"
college,fmvl9uh,t1_fmvkyfj,1586421113.0,"Yeah, Iâ€™ve taken this professor and I trust him 100%! Iâ€™m just have a difficult time cause Iâ€™m trying really hard to adjust to having to learn at home :/ itâ€™s such a shock to have to transition to video conferences!"
college,fmvjk4f,t1_fmvjaky,1586419282.0,Elementary stats :( math is my worst subject by far
college,fmviwew,t3_fxo6t8,1586418599.0,Definitely feel like Iâ€™m gonna fail my stats class AGAIN which sucks so bad because I was trying my hardest and had it down but online classes are so hard for me ðŸ˜”
college,fmvinvj,t1_fmudcrm,1586418356.0,No amount of self discipline can help someone who simply canâ€™t learn in an online setting. We didnâ€™t sign up for online classes for a reason. Nowâ€™s not the time to blame someone for being uncomfortable in a completely different setting than they anticipated to be in.
thebachelor,fmjlz3h,t1_fmjlura,1586132999.0,"LOLLLLL SO TRUE

This gives me 60â€™s vibes tbh"
