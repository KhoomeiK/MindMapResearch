berkeley,fp4gu56,t1_fp46f6j,1588298752.0,"There are countless other lines of work for essential workers which are required to run a society other than just doctors that you probably have never noticed. Maintenance workers, grocery workers, electrical workers, food production facility workers, transportation workers, truck drivers, and much much more. So, again, your decision doesn’t just affect YOU, so stop acting like it does.

And to your second point, in your mind, is the virus just going to go away? We lift the restrictions and it’ll just stop being there? A 3% death rate (which certainly will not be the case due to strains on the healthcare system) seems like nothing until you consider that it would leave 5 million people dead in the US. I’m not sure if you’ve had the privilege of taking an economics course, but suddenly taking out 5 million workers and consumers abruptly out of the system and telling the rest of the consumers to ignore the pile of bodies in the corner is a sure fire way to destroy an economy. And by the way, now there’s 5 million dead people to tack onto the economic decimation. All lifting the lockdown will do is delay any hope of an actual economic recovery."
berkeley,fp450jd,t1_fp44kpn,1588291812.0,"“No one is forcing essential workers to go to work”

How naive are you? While other people have the luxury of working at home without losing their jobs, you know, the thing that keeps them alive and fed, essential workers do not. If they do not go into work, then they will not be able to feed their family, to survive. So no, that’s not an option they have.

“If they didn’t want to work in these conditions they could have chosen any career path”

Ignoring the fact that most of these workers come from low income backgrounds thus this idea that they could have chosen “any” career path is obscene, so because they ended up in a lower career path, they should die because you want to go out and hang out with your friends? Now we see that you’ve completely abandoned the precept that it is an ‘individual choice’ because that’s so clearly untrue, so instead now you’re arguing that these people deserve to be exposed to the virus.

It positively boggles the mind the selfishness of some people.

And of course you ignore the health care system because there is absolutely no counter argument to that and no way around it. Lifting restrictions before the data shows it is safe to do so will cause a health care system collapse, the science is quite assured on that front."
berkeley,fp43xhg,t1_fp4361p,1588291196.0,"Did you ignore everything I just said? It’s not as simple as “stay the fuck home” if you don’t want to get it. Essential workers have to go into work, people
Working minimum wage to subsist have to go into work, healthcare workers have to deal with you. Your “individual” choice affects all these people around you (and will aid in the collapse of our healthcare system which would indeed kill many healthcare workers).

Try to have a little fucking perspective and humility you privileged prick."
berkeley,fp41g0s,t1_fp3k17k,1588289812.0,"Except your dumbass definition of individual liberty doesn’t apply to something like a HIGHLY VIRAL PANDEMIC, because your decision doesn’t affect only you, it affects everyone around you and the healthcare workers in the healthcare system which will collapse if we allow everyone to run around unfettered.

Not to mention all the workers who will be forced to decide between their job and their health because they will be fired if they refuse to go into work when you reopen the economy. 

And not to mention the fact that reopening preemptively will just delay any viability of actual economic recovery.

Just fuck off with this shit already, it’s obscene."
berkeley,fnwy6cv,t1_fnwxmjl,1587327767.0,"You’re right, it’s better to have an essential utility run as a private enterprise completely governed by the laws of profit, so that it’s constantly offering you a shittier experience for more money, constantly making seats smaller, adding extra price tags to bags, has absolutely no ability to limit the damage it does to the environment because it needs to focus on profit and competition, and meanwhile is making money hand over fist and spends it on corporate stock buybacks.

Its the same philosophy that was used in the 2008 financial crisis, and the result was the widening of economic inequality, further rendering us vulnerable to external crises like what we are experiencing now. At some point, you have to fix the damn problem, and you can’t keep kicking the can down the road for “expediency” issues."
berkeley,fnwnw29,t1_fnwnbwr,1587321989.0,"No, I’m advocating for a different solution that directly puts money into the hands of the people. If a company wasn’t able to stay afloat and save money for externalities because they blew their cash on stock buybacks, then they should go under; that’s how the free market works.

Instead of spending a trillions of dollars on corporate bailouts, institute a UBI that goes directly to the people. You could offer each one of the 6 million who filed for unemployment last week an annual UBI of 22,000$ and it would cost under 1.5$ trillion, which is less than the US is throwing @ the stock market every single day. Stop trying to solve the problem by taking money out of the hands of people who need it to consume things and keep the economy going and giving it to corporations who are going to lay off people anyways."
