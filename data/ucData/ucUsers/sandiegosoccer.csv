UCSD,fphuasu,t1_fphl5yb,1588627933.0,Really hope it's available for everyone for the sake of those who are immunocompromised

Hope it means the same at UCSD"
MLS,fp8lelk,t1_fp8itfh,1588395430.0,"Nice, I've yet to install option files for my PES, but I guess that's why I like FIFA more - the authenticity & realness of it. But yeah there's definitely pros & cons to both games, but I still think FIFA would be better for USL for the sake of professionalism alone."
MLS,fp8hvmy,t1_fp8hi3r,1588392713.0,Yeah or PS4
MLS,fp8h184,t1_fp8gncc,1588392086.0,Not for consoles
UCSD,fp7roke,t3_gbsyg7,1588376395.0,"Not anymore, they have [SAP requirements](http://faoforms.ucsd.edu/forms/SAPstandardsUndergrad.pdf) instead"
UCSD,fp4plva,t1_fp4drew,1588304308.0,Wouldn't surprise me if there's a single quarterly tuition cost in the future so there's less transparency for service fees
UCSD,fp4on2q,t3_gb9lms,1588303680.0,"Fin aid should pretty much just cover your tuition, only a bit left over for food/rent; & you don't have to live in SD"
UCSD,fp4gzqz,t1_fp4gmyf,1588298847.0,I still don't think you understand the scientific facts regarding the spread of the virus. Many more will be affected by the virus if you continue to have a one-sided view to this. Come talk to me when you truly understand the perils of a virus of this magnitude.
UCSD,fp4fzld,t1_fp4f30m,1588298227.0,">This is just a fact dude, 80% of cases are asymptomatic. 4/5 of people infected will not even notice it.

Just another cold/flu, got it. Haven't heard that before...

There is no point in discussing this anymore, it's obvious where your priorities are (money) whereas for others it's health. I just hope that you'll one day see the flaw in your argument. End of discussion."
USLPRO,fp3et4q,t3_gb1nzt,1588278057.0,Wishing to see USLC & CPL in FIFA - much more licensing & professionalism
MLS,fp3dh0h,t1_fp3dahc,1588277397.0,Yeah people usually prefer the gameplay on PES but the licensing issue is a big turnoff for me
MLS,fp3con5,t3_gb1nrf,1588277010.0,"Really hope to see USLC & CPL in FIFA. If you want your league to be seen as being professional, get on FIFA. PES is a second rate game tbh compared to the licensing and professionalism of FIFA."
UCSD,fp3c9i6,t1_fp1p31u,1588276801.0,"You still don't seem to have a firm understanding of the issue at hand and are selfishly downplaying it because you're concerned about your money. And no, we are not better prepared for the second wave; scientists are predicting a much harder-hit second wave similar to the Spanish flu. Stay away from the far-right forums of politicans' propaganda and try to read what the scientists are saying."
UCSD,fp1fotv,t1_fp1c8ci,1588233954.0,"I don't think you properly understand the concepts of virology, immunology or epidemiology and I really suggest you research and educate yourself better. As unfortunate as it is, we may even have to stay closed for another year until vaccines are developed, let alone another 4 months. [Scientists are predicting a second wave](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/live-updates-as-quarantine-fatigue-spreads-fauci-says-second-wave-of-coronavirus-is-inevitable/ar-BB13lEuR) due to 'quarantine fatigue' mindsets like yours as well as the lower class & conspiracy theorists pushing their reopen protests. Millions more could get infected if we reopen for the sake of our greed."

UCSD,fp09p0d,t1_fp06pmd,1588205111.0,"They don't have the 36 unit requirement for financial aid anymore, it's now based on things like satisfactory academic progress through the percentage of classes completed (see the link above)"
UCSD,fp022v7,t3_gai7lp,1588201032.0,Fortunately they don't have a 36 unit requirement for financial aid anymore but [there is an SAP requirement](http://faoforms.ucsd.edu/forms/SAPstandardsUndergrad.pdf)
UCSD,fozi39h,t1_fozhlni,1588191026.0,"Could be. I've contacted them quite a few times and they've told me the 36 unit requirement is what they previously used but they've now changed it. Their website confirms this as there is [no mention of 36 units in their form anymore but they do mention the SAP](http://faoforms.ucsd.edu/forms/SAPstandardsUndergrad.pdf). Wish they'd be more consistent in their responses but I'm 99% sure SAP is used now instead of 36 units for financial aid, though your college or department may have a 36 unit requirement."
UCSD,fozhebw,t1_foxnmsg,1588190696.0,"Hmm that's weird, I've been told before that financial aid is not looking at the 36 unit completion anymore (SAP instead) but other departments could be"
UCSD,fozgddm,t1_fozbv3s,1588190204.0,I'm really nervous since reopening too quickly could lead to a second wave in the fall/winter
UCSD,foxlzwx,t1_foxciwt,1588148264.0,"On the flip side, if someone with immunodeficiency can take all classes online"
UCSD,fovvj3t,t1_fovsx9v,1588108256.0,"Yeah, I just hope professors won't enforce mandatory in-person classes/participation if there is in fact a high chance for a [second wave](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/g5n163/cdc_director_warns_second_wave_of_coronavirus/) in the fall/winter"
