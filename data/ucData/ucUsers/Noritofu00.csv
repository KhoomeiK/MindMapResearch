AskReddit,fp6xu7o,t1_fp50jcp,1588360482.0,"I certainly agree there is a mindset of ignoring the unbelievable problems people outside of first world countries face, but what are realistic actions one can take in first world countries to help. The major obstacle I see is distance, and if I were to either move or remotely try and help from my community, it would probably become just a full time job. Would these problems be better solved by governments who have a larger amount of resources then individuals?"

changemyview,fooxgst,t1_foox4wt,1587948528.0,"Also this is my opinion and more based on anecdotal evidence. Take it with a grain of salt. :)


I am speculating here, but when I ever see talks about whether social media is causing depression/mental illnesses, or video games sparking violence and anger in youth, I believe that these mediums are certainly sparking or inspiring negative acts, but they are never the reason. History has clearly shown that human violence or mental illness don’t need technology to exist. But they certainly do amplify the worst parts of us. And they can also amplify the best of ourselves. But these reasons for bullying, mental illnesses, and violence are as old as we are or even older. And the solutions to these problems are far older then the technology we have; to simply care for one another. Taking your son or daughters phone and limiting there access to social media won’t stop depression, suicide, or bullying. But what I wish I had was to be comforted and understood by the people I loved. It won’t stop any pain I would’ve felt growing up, but it would’ve made it more bearable."

But it would be harder to create a control devoid of any influence from any social media. An easier solution would to compare previous generations of adolescents who have had no social media by our standards (i.e. internet, twitter, etc.)."
changemyview,fooas9k,t1_fongfo2,1587935704.0,"Looking through the study itself, it seems that the researchers are very skeptical that social media is the exact root cause for mental illnesses in adolescents. 

 ""We don't have an experimental study in which we have a group of young people exposed and another group that are not exposed to social media, or that removed their digital devices from their hands and measured whether they were less depressed."" But Mojtabai acknowledged it is ""plausible"" for social media to have had an effect.

The researchers do recognize that the increase use of social media has had a positive effect  when comparing adolescents from 2008 to 2017. But one expert also comments that the rate of mental illness is lower than previous generations beyond the gen Y they tested. 

What I can glean is that social media is certainly affecting adolescents, but I don’t think limiting adolescent use or access will completely end mental illness among adolescents because it is not the root cause."

The animation and model texture makes it look like an animatronic, but a realistic plastic animatronic."
