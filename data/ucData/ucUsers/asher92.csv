AskReddit,fp8q4oc,t3_gc0cbd,1588399378.0,"I have a good one. 

Took my girlfriend to her 8am final then went back to her house to sleep some more. Woke up in sleep paralysis hallucinating that my legs were getting dragged up to the ceiling. I tried to fight back but was paralyzed, then the thing started shaking me legs up into the bed trying to drag me into the upper corner of the room. 

Weird thing is, that night my gfs roommate had sleep paralysis and hallucinated she was being dragged out of her room and into the hallway. My girlfriend had an episode the next night and then the third roommate the night after. Then it stopped. 

That was weird. Another less terrifying but equally strange sleep paralysis I had was a total and complete fractalization of my bedroom wall."

Coachella,fngeuqg,t3_g1lqev,1586930068.0,"I got separated from my crew the day arcade fire played in 2011. Knew some friends would be at arcade fire so I went solo not knowing much about them. Totally blew me away, but then at about wake up I thought it was time to maybe position myself to find my crew as we were carpooling off site after. So I started heading out. I didn’t make it too far until the chorus hit, all the lights turned on and I could see everyone in the crowds illuminated faces screaming along to the chorus. Goosebumps. I turned around and saw the ball drop. Holy shit. Ran back in and stayed to the end. Got a ball and carried it out with me. My first Coachella and probably my favorite memory. Although the chemical brothers glow stick eruption is right up there too."
