surfing,fnzr2gu,t1_fnwyjld,1587399245.0,">If you give an inch they'll want a foot.

This is probably right.  Plus, my guess is that enforcing half measures would take way more resources than enforcing a full lockdown.  Idk, I still hope they find a way to open it back up or at least do a better job of explaining why it is closed and the conditions for opening it back up."
surfing,fnzqd4a,t3_g4bgon,1587398880.0,You can thank your well known neighbor Derek Dunfee for that.  He thought it was all cool and rebellious to post video of people surfing there.  Of course the cops were gonna come and sit on it after that.  How a bunch of grown men who get off on localism don't get that blowing up your spot as the place to flaunt the law is a stupid idea is beyond me.  I hope Dunfee got a ticket.
sandiego,fnzow7m,t1_fnwqlz4,1587398127.0,In what way have they been behind the curve?  I think they've done a good job.  Faulconer seemed to have deferred to the county for most of the updates - reasonable.  I would like to see him do a better job of communicating why the beaches need to remain closed.  I think he'll have a near mutiny when the weather warms up next weekend.
surfing,fnzni44,t3_g4lvui,1587397404.0,"KUSI is trash and this is just GOP mayor trying to show off to his base.  There is a way to make this point effectively and this is not it.  Coronado has limited parking/access/population and the widest beach around.  It also has shit surf most of the time.  Leadership would be this guy laying out his logic to keep his beaches open, the operating conditions for the beaches, and what he would be watching that would cause him to change his approach.  This is just political point scoring."

aws,fnlggko,t1_fnik7rr,1587053122.0,I 100% agree.  A $100 initial limit would make a lot of sense.  Or force a person to set an initial limit as the first thing they do with a new account.
aws,fnleex7,t1_fnicot7,1587052099.0,"People from many different fields with many different backgrounds are being pushed towards AWS.  It is easy to get in over your head without understanding what you're doing - even if you're trying to.  Amazon UX is probably great for someone with a CS background.  As someone who is just trying to do HPC, it is quite frustrating.  I spent hours yesterday trying to figure out how to closely monitor my spending and set up alerts with no success - apparently the way my organization monitors and records spending (i'm at a university) makes all of Amazon's built in cost monitoring inaccessible."
aws,fnldum6,t1_fnjkakx,1587051813.0,"I am glad you had a positive experience.  Another way of looking a the generosity of their free tier is that they don't make money from individual users. Sounds like they have active monitoring for credentials on github - seems smart.  They could have a similar system to monitor/ensure that individual accounts don't accidentally spend a massive amount of money, but they choose not to.  Seems like they are forgiving the first time and it works out fine for the vast majority of people."
aws,fniy5s1,t1_fniiazx,1586988459.0,I'm am being sympathetic.  I don't think AWS is user friendly as a beginner.  Any service that allows someone to accidentally spend $60k is broken.
aws,fnicwac,t1_fni9jbr,1586977868.0,"I 100% agree. People from many different disciplines are moving towards AWS, and the UX is not very friendly or familiar at least to me. I don’t think they are trying to get money from people who screw up, I think they just don’t care about little guys when they have massive clients to focus on."
aws,fnehq6e,t1_fncjh67,1586889578.0,"Thank you!  Yes, your edit answered my question.  I guess the real way to figure it out is to try running a batch of jobs with a small master node and just monitor the usage."
aws,fnb39y2,t3_g0j64o,1586808456.0,"Does anyone have experience with AWS ParallelCluster?    


Any suggestions for what type of EC2 instance to use for the front end node?  It would seem like you could use something very cheap or free tier eligible would be sufficient since it only has to launch compute nodes then sit idle."
UCSD,fn0rmxk,t1_fn0qszq,1586547435.0,"I guess I tend to side with the university here (surprising even to me), but I can see where you're coming from.  It's a fluid situation."
UCSD,fn0qiop,t3_fydo0c,1586546831.0,"Also, being quarantined in Mesa Nuevo with an 11 year old sound miserable. I feel for him on that point. Heading back with family for this period of time might have been his best solution either way. I’m sure it was a challenge parenting in that small space."
UCSD,fn0pzry,t1_fn0isiq,1586546547.0,"Does that apply to private residences? If someone in an apartment building is positive, do all residents have a right to know?  

I am trying to understand you here. Is it that the university was specifically placing them there that changes the equation? Was the blanket disclosure not sufficient?"
UCSD,fn0dcnp,t1_fn06yo1,1586539868.0,"Does the university owe it to residents to notify them where students are being quarantined? They gave a blanket notice, do we need to know room numbers?"
UCSD,fmzyhje,t3_fydo0c,1586532074.0,"That is a pretty terrible article and it does not make Sam look good.  If you lived in a private apartment building would you expect your landlord to disclose health information about other people in your building?  What if a person already renting in that building gets sick?  Should the university kick them out?  As long as they are in isolation, they are not impacting you!  Show a bit of a sense of community in these times, Sam.  If you were planning to isolate with your kid, why does it matter who else is in the building?

The university definitely sent out a memo regarding the potential to house people in isolation, and I know local healthcare workers were told it was going to be an option.  It looks like they had to update the article to make it clear that it is an entirely different building that is being used to house healthcare workers or other people under quarantine for the County.  It reads like a bunch of drivel.

eta: the class action lawsuit was the best part of the article.  That one is really going places."
sandiego,fmv0li8,t3_fxitcy,1586403155.0,"I am encouraged that the new cases per day is still below 100.  Seems like we are past the inflection point on cases which is impressive.  Hospitalizations and deaths will peak later, but I am much more optimistic about how San Diego looks to weather this first wave."
