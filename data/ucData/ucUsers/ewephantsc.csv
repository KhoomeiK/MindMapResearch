UCSD,fmzcg07,t3_fi9kzn,1586515207.0,is anyone a poli sci: data analytics major? im looking to switch into it but i have a few questions and cant find much info. How math heavy is it in relation political science? And are there research opportunities for this major? I'm worried those in a pure data science major would be at an advantage when applying for internships and jobs so would I need to get a masters? i guess im just wondering what the job prospects are for someone with this major as it isn't pure data analytics
