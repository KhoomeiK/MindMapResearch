conservatives,fpk111m,t3_gdcrsg,1588685788.0,"Their government is tightening down on their citizens to prevent uprising by using AI to to track and stop people before they commit crimes aganist the state. They're also facing major demographic issues due to the one child policy which will ruin their economic power as well. The CCP knows what is happening and they are doing whatever they can to maintain their control internally. This is evidenced by xi jinping's consolidation of power by purging party officials under an anti corruption campaign. Developing a social credit system with tracking infrastructure, and the stem of capital flight from china hence the reason for rising property prices in certain areas around the US. The rich in china see what is coming and they're trying to get out while they still can by liquidating assets and moving them out through Macau and hong kong. In the next decade they will start to become more isolated from the outside world. In short several decades the CCP has ruled, only xi jinping has come close to the amount of control mao held."
UCSC,fp58dpk,t1_fp4q6hx,1588319887.0,The one who cheat cheat just miss out on the learning. You trade your grade for experience in the subject.
UCSC,fowwy2g,t1_fowv3cu,1588128938.0,For overall cost off campus can be cheaper but Fin. Aid does make the difference for on campus.
UCSC,foti5mo,t1_fotgze3,1588054658.0,Lol. That's a good joke.
UCSC,fotfsb8,t1_fotc8ho,1588052656.0,Memorization has always come easier for me. Its just busy work. CS problems require more critical thinking.
UCSC,forvwvs,t3_g980ec,1588019440.0,You'll probably get in if less people enroll this year due to the virus.
UCSC,foj0fug,t3_g7q174,1587803495.0,I prefer the online classes as I don't have to do the daily commute from off campus anymore.
UCSC,foimltg,t1_foi4okn,1587790576.0,banana yellow
UCSC,fodifng,t1_foc7m0r,1587685085.0,Nobody deserves a lower GPA but i would say it is advisable to not take major courses as P/NP as it would show up on the transcript and may seem weak to some recruitment groups. In the end i agree they should be allowed to choose for themselves.
UCSC,fo47vut,t3_g56jaf,1587499708.0,Cal state LA since you don't plan on going into academia.
asian,fo27oaa,t1_fo1n1k4,1587452374.0,If there is evidence of discriminatory treatment towards a person i will support said person plain and simple. You cannnot just accuse an entire group based off their skin color which makes you no better than them.
UCSC,fnxdos8,t1_fnx35cm,1587336527.0,"Im not sure.  Other can correct me if im wrong, but i recall the admissions process for impacted majors are kinda different. So it depends if you're going CE or CS."
UCSC,fnvgli6,t1_fnt8ajo,1587292538.0,hopefully the next school year will be different.
UCSC,fnvgjs4,t3_g3zede,1587292487.0,your weighted GPA needs to be 4.20 otherwise its a no go. lol
Coronavirus,fnpq5x5,t1_fnooyjm,1587149964.0,Because orange man bad! Reddit is a joke.
asian,fnmksml,t3_fv7ac5,1587073223.0,"You are blinded by your own hatred which makes you exactly the type of person you advocate against. If you actually knew what was happening inside of China you would realize that what they're doing to the expats there will be detrimental to the Chinese and Asian communities outside of China and geopolitical relations with many countries. As another person in this thread put you can't fight fire with fire. I hope you change your point of view because this path you choose/wish for will only lead to more conflict, won't fix anything, and would cause more damage in social and political relations."
UCSC,fnkkkox,t1_fnkghqu,1587030611.0,yes i just checked class schedules. confirmed its cse 30.
UCSC,fnjf1ho,t3_g1ong5,1586997650.0,Negative. Build more housing! The long range dev. Plan shows that expanded housing and rec can go beyond c9/10 and crown and Merrill. Lets do it. Dab on the haters!
UCSC,fnjexah,t1_fnipqyr,1586997583.0,Exactly.
UCSC,fnjectt,t1_fnermn2,1586997262.0,Lmfao. Thats a good one.
UCSC,fneob4t,t1_fne7qoe,1586892923.0,Dew it
UCSC,fnd58i1,t3_g1288p,1586859255.0,"lol ""art hoes"". ""be grateful"". Good luck in your future career with film. You've already got job offers and that's a major plus."

UCSC,fn7z54b,t3_g05y98,1586730570.0,If you plan it right it shouldnt be a problem. I recommend a head start so you dont struggle in the beginning.
UCSC,fn5ky2i,t3_fzkcrb,1586667698.0,I highly doubt this school has a lot of right-wing people.
UCSC,fn4kgjf,t1_fn413cm,1586643213.0,lol
UCSC,fn42ifu,t1_fn2tw74,1586632737.0,Looks pretty close to 9/10
UCSC,fn2mno9,t1_fn2hedq,1586594762.0,Definitely
UCSC,fn2g9hm,t3_fyo29j,1586587934.0,"9/10 since its in the middle of everything. As a freshman your classes will be all over the place, so 9/10 is more accessible and the DH is open late."
UCSC,fn2g3wr,t3_fyvih7,1586587781.0,"I agree but this is also a UC, so it curriculum is different from a state school. If you wanted to just learn xyz and go into industry a state school would've probably been a better choice."
UCSC,fn2g1jc,t1_fn2do6u,1586587715.0,graduating next year? Hopefully the economy will be good by then.
UCSC,fn2funn,t3_fyu53b,1586587528.0,build one at 9&10.

UCSC,fmyss82,t3_fxqyuo,1586494677.0,Yes. Contact their facebook page. Rotc classes are done with sjsu. So you'll have to travel across the hill.
UCSC,fmyrukk,t1_fmyb6ax,1586493900.0,"If you have sb or sd for CS id go with those instead. Based of your profile preference id say sd is your best choice. Nonetheless, if you do end up coming to SC it will be small group you can relate to/socialize with as compared to SD."
UCSC,fmyqc4t,t3_fy4ux3,1586492676.0,Lol nice joke. That will never happen.
UCSC,fmo9r08,t1_fmo6vq3,1586250799.0,yeah i got an email with a receipt saying the rest of the meals were removed from my balance. Nothing about amount of money refunded though.
UCSC,fmo315t,t1_fmnarzx,1586243550.0,never mind lol I checked the email again. They just deducted the meals from my balance. I skimmed over and didnt read all of it.
UCSC,fmm8q9w,t1_fmm0bhv,1586200873.0,Whether that is positive or negative is a point of view. Some programs have so much redtape that it doesn't benefit anyone while other programs are more effective in helping people.
UCSC,fmlr2ii,t3_fw1gk1,1586191658.0,Yes.
UCSC,fmkkqfx,t1_fmkj1u0,1586158347.0,We clearly have differing points of view. Simply put I don't see it that way in some cases.
UCSC,fmkc49i,t1_fmkbk1u,1586150206.0,"I wouldn't say he is the best, but a pretty good president compared to the past few. He's delivered on most of what he has campaigned on."
