It used to be a sense of urgency, the supposed thrill or rush from saving someone’s life. But then I think about it, and I wonder if a thank you card is worth sacrificing 12 years from the prime of my life along with hundreds of thousands of debt.

The knowledge is great, don’t get me wrong, but I’ve always felt medicine was like being an encyclopedia- you’re not making any discoveries that are able to be implemented in the field immediately, you are practicing off of literature/evidence based medicine. I would go into academia/industry if I wanted to find that kind of knowledge.

With the changing political atmosphere, I am deathly afraid that a politician in the future is radical enough to either severely cut physician pay or forgive future medical school debt while the applicants of today are not included in that forgiveness plan.

Additionally, sentiment towards physicians seem to be changing. Doctors were the respected and sought after position in the twentieth century. Now, physicians are verbally abused, both by patients and during residency, while many are being prohibited to use PPE/speak out against inadequate protocols in place for COVID-19 and state authorities are asking them to volunteer with no pay (Remember, while they have hundreds of thousand in debt!)

But then again, I guess they say the grass is always greener on the other side."
