AskReddit,fpduet4,t1_fpdt2ag,1588534441.0,And where are the women's perspectives on this? Do you see the flaw with this article? This is really telling of the broader issues there are with men's expectations of women in our society.
AskReddit,fpdu462,t1_fpdplv0,1588534267.0,"No one said they were a ""rapist monster"" though.  You can misread a signal WITHOUT physically forcing themselves. Even a ""hey, would you like to go out sometime,"" while still misreading the situation, would have been passable. But more than likely we experience the former. Ask yourself WHY they felt the need to push themselves on someone instead of TALKING to her like a healthy person. 

If you see that as transactional, then I feel bad for you and your inability to process human kindness..."

Then I found a public school and while the pressure is still there, I can be more honest with grading. 

My point? Welcome to teaching."
