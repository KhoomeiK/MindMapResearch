period,fpi6dn1,t1_fpi4rju,1588634565.0,"ok well if you’re using pads, I recommend bringing like a gallon ziploc bag to place your used ones in—that way you can keep them contained and discreet until you can throw them away :-) especially important when yer camping out with wild life haha

good luck and again I am always happy to answer questions, I’m 18 but it wasn’t so long ago that I went through just what you’re going through!!"
menstruation,fpi56wh,t3_gb54o7,1588633886.0,"I was about a month away from being 16 when I got mine, I’m now 18 and have grown like an inch in the last year. Puberty comes late and slow for some—I had very small breasts as well all through high school and now I wear a D cup, haha! She’s probably just fine, and if she feels bad you could remind her that going slow means later menopause and fewer stretch marks from growing ;-)"
period,fpi3fcb,t3_gcl3q2,1588632893.0,also home pregnancy tests aren’t accurate until about two weeks after conception—you should definitely get a blood test for pregnancy at your doctor’s office
period,fpi2z8g,t3_gdaucc,1588632643.0,"soy *is* a natural estrogen emulator (to my knowledge) BUT it would be very unlikely to affect you hormonally very much or very immediately. you are young and just starting your menstrual cycle, so it is very very normal for it to be irregular. sometimes periods start and stop, sometimes clots happen—normal can be a lot of things. unless you are passing clots larger than a quarter or bleeding heavily for upwards of a week, I would not be too concerned. I used to miss periods completely some months, get lighter or heavier bleeding, different colors, all sorts of things. It will probably become more regular as you get older—don’t worry!"
period,fpi2a95,t3_gdftf2,1588632258.0,"get a menstrual cup girl!!! I use one for every period but I have had an especially good experience with it camping! nothing to throw away, no supplies needed, you just put it in, go all day, and bring a wet wipe with you to clean your hands when you need to empty it, which you can do anywhere. pm me if you want tips!! it’s also great for swimming and waste-free :-)"

Just see those big jugs jiggling/
nipple rings jingling too/
come on it’s sexy Heather/
for a lapdance together for you.

Inside the cash is flowing/
and friends are calling woooo hoooo/
come on it’s lovely Heather/
for a close get-together with you.

Rub him up/
rub him down/
make him feel macho/
just look at his dough/
she’s grinding up and down/
so he will blow.

Rub him up/
rub him down/
make him feel so grand/
it’s fantasy land/
she’s grinding along with this song/
as he slides off his wedding band.

Her cheeks are nice and rosy/
and oh so horny is he/
he wonders as to whether/
he could lay sexy Heather for free.

He’ll grope the ass before him/
and dump a bit of his goo/
come on it’s hottie Heather/
for a lapdance together for you.

There’s a bachelor party at the club called “Easy Lay”/ 
It’ll be the perfect climax for a perfect day/
they’ll be seeing the jugs they love to see without a single thought/
at the strip club they watch as all the implants flop/
flop, flop, flop.

There’s a happy feeling in his pants that he can buy/
when his wife asks where he was he’ll simply smile and lie/
it’ll nearly be like the truth for him without a second thought/
these wonderful lies are the lies/
he forgets if he simply tries.

Inside his wallet’s empty/
no girls aplenty/
it’s true/
oh no, there’s no more Heather/
with her whip made of leather/
boo hoo."
