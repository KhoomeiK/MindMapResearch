ucla,fpht0d3,t1_fph5xgv,1588627262.0,"You're absolutely right, it very much is and from what I've been told - again was a North Campus major - that situation is arguably more pronounced in South Campus.

While it is great that UCLA is such an elite research institution, the UCs were chartered ultimately to produce a well educated work force for the state of California, and in this day and age, I'd argue that most people attend any major 4 year university for the life long professional opportunities it opens. If that is in research for a public entity, that's great but one would have to assume that is the minority of students at this point.

Our direct competition in many job markets are either elite private schools with extensive school sponsored resources well beyond anything any publics have, or the other elite publics. Our disadvantage there is that our alumni body is way way less involved, especially outside of LA, then the likes of Michigan, Virginia, Texas, and even Berkeley.

Professional clubs have been a very effective method of promoting UCLA students into their respective fields, and have been extremely successful, no thanks to the school or USAC. But this kind of bootstrap recruitment support, while respected in it's tenacity, is not a long term solution.

And since to your point, since the school has firmly decided that they will promote the research and academia path over immediate professional placement, this would be an immensely important and actually useful undertaking for USAC that would actually tangibly help huge amounts of the student body."
ucla,fpgc7tx,t3_gd6jon,1588599647.0,"Been gone for years now but still hang around this subreddit to comment on sports or people discussing transition to the professional world out of my major, but had to chime in on this.

I was Econ and Poli Sci, but I 100% agree with this. USAC might as well be a very expensive LARPing community for the amount of completely useless representation and access they want to have in state politics that does nothing for common UCLA student, especially the one grinding in South Campus.

Yes, people want college to be an enriching experience, but at the end of the day, work load (and yes even for Econ guys we got crushed since even if school was much easier than South Campus, you had to grind outside of school from day one to look competitive on a resume) demands that quality of life improvements and funding and support of professional placement infrastructure (which the school is terrible at and is largely left to clubs), are paramount to the vast majority of people I ever talked to.

9/10 students will never see a dime of funding that USAC ever wanted to deploy on any faux woke initiatives and you'll almost never know or feel the impact of dues.

That's why I said it then and I'll say it now, USAC unfortunately a stereotypical poster child of how many older people unfortunately view the politics of younger people - that it is fiscally irresponsible and out of touch of the realities of people just trying to make it and go up in the world. 

And until the guy with concrete and practical uses of student government and it's dues can beat out some wishy washy student empowerment initiative that is never really quantified or felt by the majority of the students populace, then USAC should be temporarily disbanded and rechartered with a better defined and more realistic purview.

USAC as it was when I was there years ago - and still now it seems - is nothing more than a highly funded Model UN, and just as disfunctional.

worldnews,fp6keom,t1_fp6imaq,1588353853.0,"In my opinion, that transition away from pensions with targeted returns dates to 401ks has produced some of the biggest system issues in the market, since majority holders and thus the boards are almost exclusively large mutual funds or completely passive investors that either require near term returns to attract retail investors or performance that  keeps pace with the indices it is in, regardless of if that makes sense or not.

Thus, short term growth for growth's sake is often rewarded by the market even if it is economically pointless, or dangerous.

A return to pension at this point is basically impossible though, unless it was to be provided by the government (which would involve social security to be restarted, where every person born has a federally managed that you can opt into controlling that is seeded at birth). 

The current economic and social reality is that labor is more mobile than ever, partially of its own chosing, partially due to the current economic realities. Most people do not stay with a firm long enough to ever qualify for pensions even if we were to bring back the system that died in the 1980s, and it becomes a legal nightmare for all parties involved if they were to become transferable (since your money is locked in a nebulously valuated account sitting on the corporations balance sheet). Additionally, during bankruptcy, you lose everything unlike a normal downturn where you stand to at most lose ~30-50%, and that is only temporary.

So unless Unions come back and people invest into managed pension through their dues or the government gives an option where they handle it, I do not think the pension will ever come back, even if I do think it was a positive thing as far as corporate governance was concerned."

If you have not received any cash from the stock, it's all paper gains any you own nothing. At the end of the day, stock is just a piece of paper until you have convinced some else otherwise and they pay you for it.

There are some ""mark to market"" related taxes for partial but material ownership of companies and for foreign investment vehicles but those are thing you'll almost never have to deal with."
worldnews,fp56u7j,t1_fp56739,1588318319.0,"Yes, capital gains, which applies to almost anything that is bought or sold as an investment (and stock is clearly an investment) is taxed.

Any gains you made above your original investment principal is taxed, generally at 15%, although for wealthy individuals it has been raised to 20% (corporate cap gains also have been recently raised, now to 21%).

If you buy and sell rapidly (as in hold a stock for less than a year) the government says that now you are a trader and this is part of your income, so you pay ordinary income tax on those gains instead.

Dividends, basically how much a company will pay it's shareholders every year will be treated as ordinary income by the IRS depending on how you actually own or touch that stock.

The idea of why cap gains is less than income is to try to not double tax people trying to grow wealth since for the vast majority of individuals, you already paid income taxes on what you invested into the market. Additionally, you don't want to tax someone on a basis that would require him or her to have to sell the asset just to pay the tax associated with holding it, so as a result we just tax you when you actually turn something into cash."
worldnews,fp565vt,t1_fp51z1f,1588317633.0,"As much as I like that conceptually, like all things there are trade offs and reasons why we have the tax regime we have.

Velocity of money key factor in the health and growth of an economy and is maintained largely through consumption in a developed economy. So from a macroeconomics perspective, is that something you really want to potentially suppress? Additionally there is the valid question about how as a percentage of income, a poor person, who we are ostensibly trying to elevate in the economy to be more socially productive, is going to be spending as a percentage of income higher amounts of taxes than people with higher income.

While a consumption tax does personally benefit me and I'm starting to reach that point where if you live in a major city, you're by no means at all close to wealthy but paying a boat load of taxes so I certainly want it from time to time, there are always trade offs.

I think the easiest solution frankly is for the market to tell San Francisco to fuck off with these absurd valuations disconnected from the actual economic output of these companies, and then we wouldn't have this problem.

The tax code generally works, just the tech and PE boom of the 1980s produced some glaring examples where it doesn't that reasonably piss people off. The top 1% pays over a third of all taxes collected in the US and according to Pew (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/06/a-closer-look-at-who-does-and-doesnt-pay-u-s-income-tax/) the wealthy actually pay more taxes as a percentage of government revenue than they did in 2000.

worldnews,fp4kwqe,t1_fp3onhs,1588301303.0,"The reason so few billionaires in the US do not pay a material amount of taxes compared to their net worth, is less because of shady loopholes and Cayman Islands bank accounts, although that certainly exists (and is a bigger factor in Europe where IRS equivalents aren't as powerful) but because so many of the ultra rich in the US at this point have their entire net worth tied up in non cash flow generative or marginally cash flow generative stock that for whatever reason the market or a group of investors deemed to be extremely valuable.

For example, for the longest time Jeff Bezos was one of the wealthiest men on the planet due to his equity holdings in Amazon. But until very recently in the company's history, the company didn't make any money, and it still doesn't have any dividends. Therefore, but for his salary, he doesn't actually make any tangible money in a given year unless he sells stock, which he isn't going to do in large quantities because it will shock the market value of the rest of his stock. 

So the question then is, how do you fairly effectively extend property taxes to equity stakes, and then arguably more importantly how do you make sure that doesn't cause large sections of the tech industry, arguably America's biggest export and economic strength after our financial sector, from redomiciling. 

The whole tax code is left over from when major businesses and most value in high net worth individuals was inherently tied to actually cash producing businesses, and tech, which has produced more billionaires in the developed world than any other sector is something deemed very valuable, but that the tax code is not equiped to extract value from."

A lot of the top German aces on the Eastern front seldom got in dogfights as if you got energy bled down to the deck, you would be in trouble. 

Separately if you want to spend like 20 hours of your life figuring out how to just simply not crash the fucker in DCS (and to a lesser extent in IL-2), the Bf 109 will show you those characteristics in study sims as well."

formula1,foto9qe,t3_g99v5f,1588060303.0,"I wish there was enough of a general aviation market for new planes that it would make sense to have actual manufacturer interest in air racing again like in the 1920s - 1950s.

If anyone does want to see several aircraft actually share a circuit and race almost like cars, check out Reno Air Races which to my knowledge have the last serious unlimited air racing in the world at around 500 mph for top classes.

StarWars,foqlcmg,t1_foqd0a6,1587996072.0,"To be fair, as much as I dislike the sequels though, TRoS is just mechanically a terrible movie from a pure screen writing perspective. TLJ was lore breaking, and had some bad pacing, but nothing has been as ridiculous as TRoS which almost felt like a Transformers movie in it's break neck hunting of nothing of consequence."
StarWars,foql08d,t3_g8rpyq,1587995871.0,"Rogue One is proof that more serious Star Wars movies are by far the better Star Wars movies. 

I know Lucas himself said it's all for kids, but 4 & 5 are definitely superior movies than 6 and 3 is light-years ahead of 1 & 2. 

And those are opinions I came to after seeing all of them by like age 8. Billions die in canon, trillions die in the EU, and generally it is built around a pretty dark and grounded universe.

Badly executed slapstick and tonally jarring Bathos have been consistent issues that impact immersion and tension in both the prequels and sequels, and given the strong support for the more grounded Rogue One and Mandalorian, I'm hoping that Star Wars going forward can keep that more effective tone.

If you go back to 4, the movies have always been really YA territory, and it wasn't until George realized how many Boba Fett toys he could sell that he reconsidered. And I certainly think kids can handle the ""grittier Star Wars"" or we wouldn't have watched and preferred those movies as kids!"

Since no wealthy oponent is willing to match you in that regard, or at least there is little to no precedent. Seriously, you look at almost any example and the developed nation puts up a K/D that would be considered devastating in classical warfare.

Outside of the context of WWII, developed nations have not been willing to go to genocidal lengths since the turn of the century to end popular insurgencies, and have almost never had the stomach to take the causalities or expense to garrison the opposing country.

Only way to lose as the undeveloped nation / entity is to stop being willing to die in great quantities and hope that developed nation that is surely occupying your nation doesn't put in a puppet state willing to do the things to win that original developed combatant wasn't"
