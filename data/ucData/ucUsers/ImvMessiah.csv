berkeley,fo7s435,t1_fo7m8qw,1587583593.0,"Yeah, they cover 61b/c. For deceleration, youâ€™ll need to complete 61a and cs70 with a 3.3gpa (B- overall) or higher. If you donâ€™t get that, you can take 61b/c and get a grade to boost your gpa even if you already have credit because of transfer."
berkeley,fo61ztw,t3_g5vw8f,1587543516.0,"Yeah, but honestly I think itâ€™s worth it. Thereâ€™s plenty of things Iâ€™ve learned from taking classes that already articulate for me (Iâ€™m from DVC as well,) but it helped immensely. It helps a lot for upper divs. In EECS/CS, CS70 has to be taken at Berkeley again, which is discrete math and you can take at DVC to articulate if youâ€™re a math major, but EECS and CS you have to retake it at Berkeley to move on to certain classes. 

Source: a friend and I from DVC went to speak with academic advisors our first weeks of transfer."

berkeley,fnb0al8,t3_g0n7j3,1586806982.0,Probably wouldnâ€™t be a good idea because thereâ€™s most likely going to be a midterm conflict
