UCSD,fnifea0,t1_fni80xq,1586979060.0,Thank you sooo much!
UCSD,fli0yqw,t1_flhdz0m,1585173216.0,It's funny to see you guys taking about a country you completely know nothing about with that much confidence. I have to admit your goverment did a good job on that brainwashing shit. The price for nonstop flights to China almost trebled. The only reason Im here replying your stupid post is because I cannot afford that fucking flight ticket
