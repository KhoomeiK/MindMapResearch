AskBaking,fpakihg,t1_fpaj3lc,1588450049.0,"thank you for the detailed response! would the oil be substituted on a 1:1 basis, so 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 cup oil?
also I probably should have clarified the texture I was aiming for. I don’t want it to be super light and fluffy, but more of a denser, moist pound cake texture. As of now I like the density of the cake but it’s just too dry. So in this case, using just milk would be preferable no?"
EDanonymemes,fpai6r5,t1_fpa6haj,1588448686.0,that is so much work holy cow. baking is actually a really nice coping mechanism for me. i usually give it to other people but i still get to handle food in a much less self destructive manner
UCSantaBarbara,fowkg1t,t1_fowi6dw,1588121529.0,that is the easiest way to tank a poor freshman's gpa
AskBaking,fot9ue0,t1_fot5tr3,1588048069.0,"i think i'll use it for cooking rather than baking then. thank you for the detailed response, i really appreciate it! the king arthur one was especially useful :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fos4nj2,t1_forx5m3,1588023901.0,lol was it tettegah?
UCSantaBarbara,foocpqf,t1_foo84tr,1587936653.0,honestly it felt like everyone was just going to the beach and getting shitfaced drunk 24/7 to numb the boredom
UCSantaBarbara,folgyqp,t3_g83kwg,1587862011.0,i went back to iv to grab my stuff last night and honestly from reading this sub people made iv sound way more active than it actually is. everywhere except the beach is pretty dead. i left today completely cured from my fomo
UCSantaBarbara,foej8e2,t3_g71g8c,1587705200.0,"having my own room again, a clean house, prerecorded lectures, not getting dressed for classes, homecooked meals, cuddling in bed with my pets, hanging around with my family, and enjoying this time to work on myself. and for most of us, we'll be back in IV soon enough :)"
UCSantaBarbara,foe869o,t1_foe7rnh,1587697994.0,yeah but people have already emailed the econ department saying this and they’re basically just telling everyone to fuck off. they don’t care about us
UCSantaBarbara,foe7jau,t3_g6unai,1587697613.0,"i don't mean to be a debbie downer but it's really likely not going to happen. if other departments like comm and soc opted out why would econ deserve any different? if every other department opted in except econ i think there might be a chance, but that isn't the case"
Baking,fo7nbei,t3_g5e92k,1587581265.0,this looks amazing :o please don't forget to post the recipe!
UCSantaBarbara,fo0e08h,t1_fo0cq0w,1587411328.0,"they're opening 4 new sections to get people off the waitlist, originally there were only 4 spaces and enough room for 100 students. as of now it seems 140 is still going as planned. i think the same will go for 10a"
UCSantaBarbara,fo04uiy,t3_g4wf0o,1587406105.0,140 isn't closed? i just checked
UCSantaBarbara,fa6wetk,t1_fa2x3d7,1575829243.0,you got A right? i think it was 4X1^2 +4X1X2 + x2^2 or something like that... i hope at least
