I was the most awkward and shy person before comming here but Im so glad I chose this school. If you manage your time, the work is not too bad. Honestly i dont really manage my time that well but still manage to do well lol. I had to between UCLA and another UC and Im so happy that I chose UCLA. Be a bruin!"
