berkeley,fop21p6,t3_g8psc4,1587951355.0,"Hey! Congrats on getting in!

I‚Äôm not a history major, but am pre-law as well. I think that there‚Äôs a ton of opportunities here for pre-law kids like internships, research, and resources (I even got to see RBG my first semester!). Classes are deeeefinitely challenging, but not impossible. I was able to get really good grades but I had to work for it.

I think that as long as you‚Äôre motivated, you can do it! PM me for any questions :) happy to be a resource"

berkeley,foor1bz,t3_g8an1k,1587944637.0,"Came back here from the incel post and just want to reiterate that NO GIRL‚Äîin fact, NO ONE‚Äîowes you anything :). If they don‚Äôt wanna talk to you, they don‚Äôt wanna talk to you. Some of y‚Äôall are so entitled to believing that just because you had bad experiences with women (so sorry about that, but not our fault), that every girl is required to offer you friendship or in that dude‚Äôs words, ‚Äúthe light of day.‚Äù If you‚Äôre nice, we will talk to you, just like other dudes, just like other HUMANS."
berkeley,fooqmca,t1_foohgm5,1587944387.0,"It makes me sad reading stuff like this as a girl because after many interactions with incels such as yourself, I‚Äôve come to realize that a lot of you have created this illusion that every girl is just horrible and awful.

No girl owes you anything. If they don‚Äôt wanna talk to you, then they don‚Äôt want to talk to you. Who do you think you are that you‚Äôre entitled to a girl‚Äôs romantic or platonic friendship just because you want them to? If they didn‚Äôt talk to you, it‚Äôs probably because you‚Äôve created this scenario in your head that girls are only talking to you for help with classes, or the fact that you think you‚Äôre entitled to anything more than common decency which will immediately evaporate once they realize how convoluted you are.

Have you even been around campus?? I see drop-dead gorgeous girls dating not-so objectively attractive guys all the damn time. Maybe they were nice to their now-gf‚Äôs and developed organic relationships the right way and not demonizing them at every available opportunity. But that‚Äôs impossible. Girls are only attracted to looks, right?? And when they‚Äôre with someone smart, it‚Äôs obviously because they‚Äôre gold-diggers or only there for homework answers, right?? That‚Äôs how it works in the black and white world known as your head???

Maybe try being a nice person, and stop making girls out to be such awful creatures in your head then maybe, just maybe, one will see you as a nice guy who she can be friends with and maybe develop into a romantic relationship one day."

berkeley,foipoz6,t1_foinm2y,1587793103.0,"It is tough to get in for sure. It's a lot like applying for a job where you submit a resume and go through a whole recruiting process. The difference is that they can reject you simply because you don't fit their vibe. Even if a professional frat is, well, professional, they're still a group of people who hang out and choose who they wanna spend time with.

To answer the original poster, they really are a good way to make friends. I know many people who made friends that way. Lots of networking, too. However, I found that even without joining these clubs, you can and definitely will still find ways to get internships and meeting new people. I had a person in a frat tell me that if I wasn't a part of his frat, I wouldn't get into a good grad school for my field (spoiler alert: that's a lie). I was pretty sad when I didn't get in because I thought that was the end for my career, but I still got by without their help.

I think that as long as you're dedicated to your field, you will definitely find a way with or without a frat. I think you should rush though! It's a good way to make friends, and if you don't get in, then oh well, it was a nice experience. Move on to the next opportunity.

Congrats on getting in!"
college,foia0n0,t3_g7lid0,1587781885.0,"I can only speak for Cal because that‚Äôs where I go :). Don‚Äôt listen to the stereotypes about the school being incredibly cutthroat. I personally have only seen this from a handful of overachievers and the extent of it was just humble bragging‚Äînothing that outwardly harms you. I work for the Public Health department and although I‚Äôm not majoring in it, I can guarantee you that it is the friendliest and healthiest department to be a part of on campus. Everyone who majors in it is happy that they are there.

I personally was able to secure an internship (on my way to a second) and two positions in the student government in my first year. I was able to have lots of fun while doing it, too, with parties and hanging out with friends. There are lots of opportunities here, and if you choose to come, there definitely won‚Äôt be any regrets (except maybe once in a while for a very hard class hahaha)"

berkeley,fnyx08j,t3_g4flws,1587378825.0,"I was in a similar high school situation‚Äînot a lot of studying but managing to get A‚Äôs and stuff. For the most part, I was actually really sad and depressed in high school because I felt so ridiculously unchallenged by anything. For the first 8 months (out of 10) of my senior year, my physics class learned basic algebra. It was ridiculous. Coming to Cal, I definitely felt challenged but for once in my life, I feel like I‚Äôm actually learning something rather than just doing something because I have to.

It‚Äôs different for everyone (and is very dependent on your academic plan, I believe) but I hope that if you come here, you‚Äôll find that the learning bit is actually quite interesting and not at all that bad once you start picking up good study and organizing habits :)"
berkeley,fnr8ji1,t3_g3d0jt,1587181957.0,"Even though the results might not be exactly as you wanted, I want to say congratulations for making it this far! Your GPA is great, and you will for sure make it to places one day.

I'm sure that your chances will increase from your good grades last quarter; however, I will have to let you know that last year, they did not accept anybody from the transfer waitlist (and a couple people the year prior; from my knowledge they did not have a waitlist prior to 2018, but I may be wrong). Your admission will be solely based off of how many people accept their offer of admission on June 1st and if there's space.

Good luck! (and you're doing amazing! pls don't let the any unfavorable results from this cycle dampen your mood)"
lawschooladmissions,fnpsp5f,t3_g3517d,1587151291.0,"Not at all qualified to respond (as I'm still in undergrad), but I found that taking community college classes really helped my GPA. Maybe taking a few courses you think you'd be interested in can help your GPA? If not you could probably write an addendum for your GPA.

Amazing test scores! I'm sure you can get into really good schools especially with your background. Good luck!"
