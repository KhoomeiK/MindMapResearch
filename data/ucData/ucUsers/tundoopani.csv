exhindumemes,fo7ojrb,t3_g65fbm,1587581854.0,"I'm not religious, but I still think we need to stop eating animals. It's not sustainable and very bad for the environment. The animals are treated badly and tortured. Especially in factory farming."

harrypotter,fo7kvzt,t1_fo7h7ed,1587580068.0,"Why does character development need to have sexual orientation tied to it? Why can't gay people be more than just gay people? We have more traits than just being gay... Why can't a gay character go on an epic journey without having to bring up their orientation? Why are gay characters always reduced to ""gay person""?"
harrypotter,fo7knk6,t1_fo7e4kr,1587579953.0,"Just because a character is gay, that doesn't mean they need to ""act gay"" or reveal it in some way. People don't need to show their sexual orientation to have one. I don't see all the straight adults in Harry Potter spewing around their straightness? I don't like how people expect gays to act a certain way and get offended when gay characters don't subscribe to those attributes. News flash, people come in all shapes, sizes, colors, personalities, and orientations. Dumbledore doesn't need to act on his sexual orientation just like the straight characters don't need to showcase their orientation."

UCSantaBarbara,fnjsjjb,t3_g25xmg,1587005992.0,"It's definitely a popularity contest. Honestly when OPP started getting people to vote at parties, I lost all faith in people running for AS positions. It's as dumb as running for class president in high school."

My dog doesn't like other dogs, so I control his environment. I can't control your dumb dog that doesn't realize my dog doesn't want to play.
