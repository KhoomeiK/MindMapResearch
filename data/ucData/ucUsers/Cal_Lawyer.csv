LawSchool,fp8rfti,t3_gbkker,1588400541.0,"Lmfao every time schools like Harvard (or my law school Notre Dame) increases tuition. These schools have such large endowments (10 to 40 billion) they could easily set aside a couple hundred million and pay tuition just on the returns for every student into perpetuity...and still make money. (And recoup that diverted money in a year with some status bragging donation scheme.)

These ""institutions"" are less interested in setting up the next generation to succeed and instead more interested in running giant retirement slush funds and scamming the Federal Government out of student aid/loan money.

$65,875 a year to learn ""Secured Transactions"" from an Adjunct Prof. or ""Contracts"" from a ""famous"" Prof. who doesn't even teach the difference between an assignment and a novation (which is relevant for the bar exam but breaks down more in practice.)

$300,000 debt is no fucking joke...even with Biglaw money."

politics,fp61fa4,t1_fp605kc,1588344244.0,Vague calendar reference is far from solid “documentary evidence”. I’d say Ford’s Lawyers pressuring Leland Keyser to change her story is pretty damning evidence against Ford.
