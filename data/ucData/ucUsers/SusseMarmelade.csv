UCSC,fogtkzb,t3_g6vm9k,1587756827.0,"Hey! So, I actually strongly urge you to reach out to [STARS](https://stars.ucsc.edu/), or Services for Transfer and Reentry Students, if you haven't been in contact with them yet. They're an organization on campus that would best be able to help you in regards to anything and everything transfer-student wise. Here's a [list of staff](https://stars.ucsc.edu/about-us/staff-bios.html), with emails included. You'd be good emailing Sara, Vivianna, or Janet. I hope this helps!"
