COVID19positive,fpbbazz,t1_fpb1p5l,1588466136.0,"Yeah, I had it for about 3 days, and then no fever for 2 days, and then it came back on the 6th day, and gone on the 7th day... Which isn't technically consistent but I found it weird that it came back at all. I waited 3 days after the 7th day to make sure the fever was officially gone before I stopped self-isolating in my room. Thinking back on it, tho, I think this whole thing may have been caused by me not having enough blankets when I was sleeping lol. I hope you can get tested if possible and feel better soon!"
ucla,fpa4s24,t3_gca8h4,1588440802.0,"My instinct would be to drop it now (if that's possible) and then take it in the summer... Out of curiosity, which lower div is it?"
COVID19positive,fpa46u3,t1_fp7k0ki,1588440462.0,"I feel fine, I don't think I had the virus, I just highly suspected I did at the time because the fever wouldn't go away."

COVID19positive,fn5nqgs,t1_fn4ttfy,1586670021.0,"Yeah, idk if I had/have it bc apparently consistent low-grade fevers are signs of respiratory infections and I haven't left the house since the airport, but I had no other symptoms whatsoever and haven't had a fever in about 3 days... Still don't know if that's good enough for me to leave my room though sigh"
COVID19positive,fn4t3f0,t1_fn2unly,1586648373.0,"That's good, I guess, but what sucks about this virus is that it sometimes takes more than one test for it to come out positive... Hope you really don't have it though, but the uncertainty definitely is frustrating"
ucla,fn4srwq,t1_fn4rq93,1586648174.0,Big sad
COVID19positive,fmwwx51,t1_fmvrjux,1586454478.0,Hope it comes out negative.. Even though my fever was down for a couple of days it spiked up a few hours and then went down again lol I'm so confused
COVID19positive,fmtbwkk,t1_fmtari8,1586370148.0,"That's good to hear! My fever has also dropped, but I'm still quarantined just to be safe. Keep watching for any symptoms and be careful :)"
COVID19positive,fmtbjwo,t1_fmsznad,1586369983.0,"I hope you feel better soon! I'm not trying to scare you or anything but I'd still be cautious since it often takes multiple times (I think 2-3 times) for the tests to show that you have the virus even if you tested negative before, so just be careful"
COVID19positive,fmtb8dj,t1_fmq7qzy,1586369831.0,"Thank you :) That's interesting, usually my fevers are highest during the day and low at night... Which is really weird bc that's usually not how fevers work lol. And yeah, I think if I do have this virus I'm probably more on the asymptomatic spectrum since the worst I felt was body aches in a couple of places for only 1 day. Other than that, I could feel the hotness of my skin, but that was all. How are you doing now? Has your fever gone down at all? I hope you've been feeling better!!"
COVID19positive,fmtapcz,t1_fmqe34v,1586369582.0,"Were you able to get tested? I hope you feel better soon, I only had a low fever but the uncertainty has been driving me crazy"
COVID19positive,fmtaihu,t1_fmq5t1g,1586369493.0,"My fever has actually died down yesterday and today, which is a relief, but I'm gonna still keep quarantining in case something else comes up... How are you doing today? Any other symptoms?"
COVID19positive,fmtae7n,t1_fmqwgij,1586369437.0,"That's definitely weird. What worries me though is that I haven't been anywhere since the airport and the fever showed up 13 days after. I think my fever has died down, it's been pretty consistent yesterday and today, but I'm still being cautious and am gonna keep self-isolating for maybe at least 1 or 2 more weeks..."
ucla,fmpg7ko,t1_fmo1w03,1586280274.0,"Read my comments above. High temperatures (besides boiling) do NOT kill viruses, at least in historical viruses like the flu. The key is humidity (warm air holds more moisture than cold air does) which weighs down the viral particles instead of let them float freely in the air near our noses and mouths. In this way, during the warmer seasons, it makes it harder for the virus to enter your body, but not impossible since it's still present. Your body is the still the ideal host for the virus, and no matter how hard it is for the virus to enter your body, once you get it, if you don't exercise health precautions, you'll easily spread it to everyone around you, resulting in a full-scale pandemic."
ucla,fmnj1vt,t1_fmnhte0,1586227198.0,"Dude it's literally a fact that viruses tend to do worse in higher humidity, I'm not saying that they'll disappear in hot or high-humidity settings because it doesn't work like that. Like I said before, community transmission is still the biggest issue bc it's much easier for viruses to spread when humans interact/touch with each other/breathe in each other's particles.

Also, your body is the host for the virus. The virus does not survive for as long if it doesn't have its ideal host. Hence why you'll see news about how long the coronavirus survives on paper, plastic, metal surfaces, etc. Idk why you're being so condescending and passive aggressive since you clearly don't understand how this whole thing works. You can do the research yourself if you don't want to accept what I'm saying"
ucla,fmm6cnn,t1_fmm588h,1586199600.0,"Obviously higher temperatures won't KILL the virus and this coronavirus is completely new which caught the entire world off guard. Warmer temperatures hold more moisture which is bad for viruses, and if this coronavirus is anything like other viruses, it won't do AS WELL in higher temperatures than in colder temperatures. That's not to say ppl shouldn't still be careful bc transmission is still a big issue"
ucla,fmm0vl8,t1_fmkjgku,1586196719.0,"it won't go away but viruses generally don't like hot temps, so at least the number of cases will die down and give us some breathing room/time to develop vaccines/medicine"
ucla,fm8ph14,t1_fm8h75d,1585853601.0,"Yeah, I agree. It sucks that now as a society we have to be so careful to defend every little thing we say because otherwise people automatically assume the worst of our words"
