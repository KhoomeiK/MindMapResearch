Anxiety,fphwcg9,t3_gdfeum,1588629013.0,"Yes, sometimes when I have a particularly strong one I get so dizzy and lightheaded I can’t even sit up."
ucla,fpcfc4r,t3_gck03j,1588498454.0,"As a senior.... mandatory P/NP would not be good for me. This is my last quarter to boost my GPA that last little bit for med school/grad school, which won’t help me a ton but it’s still worth something. I appreciate still being able to get those letter grades."
naath,fpadi9b,t3_gcb9yb,1588445907.0,"The whole “mom dies in childbirth” trope is one of the worst. Like, sure it’s realistic that women died in childbirth a lot in societies without modern medicine. What’s also realistic is that those women had lives and desires and did things other than motherhood BEFORE they died!"
TheLastAirbender,fnr5nfa,t1_fnr4qz5,1587179889.0,"I think what strikes such a chord in viewers is the horror of not having agency of your own body. It’s a more intimate violation to have someone control your movements than it is to be attacked by a firebender, say. In conventional combat styles there is theoretically the chance for you to evade the attack, defend, or retaliate, whereas with bloodbending your own body is the weapon."
GirlGamers,fneq6au,t3_g19w4z,1586893877.0,Imagine how exhausting it must be to give so much of a shit about what other people are enjoying
BeautyGuruChatter,fnepdcp,t1_fnelww4,1586893474.0,I work in a molecular bio research lab and this is correct. We use a solution of 70% ethanol to sanitize surfaces (and the outside of gloves!) because high alcohol concentrations just evaporate right off.
StardewValley,fn11qrd,t3_fylhzh,1586553054.0,These are awesome! I really love how in each one you get such a strong sense of the light and how it changes by season. The lighting really makes each one come alive
ucla,fl53wc6,t1_fl4rlqx,1584827908.0,"I liked 165A with Sagasti (which is required for MCDB majors), and have enjoyed 146 with Goldstein and 168 with Mikkola. I’ve heard 156 this quarter was rough but I didn’t take it. 168 was cool bc it had a ton of guest lecturers that are professors within the department."
