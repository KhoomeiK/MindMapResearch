arrow,fpad5y7,t3_gc6x2a,1588445704.0,"Most of us disagree. The consensus is S3-4 were trash(though many think was decent up to the fight). S6 was bad,s5 was great, s7 started great and went to average.

My opinion is about the same. I think S3 as a whole was trash. Like sure the beginning seemed enjoyable up to Oliver fighting Raas, but when we find out the whole mystery behind Saras death,we found out the whole thing is a convoluted mess. And S6 isn't bad, it didnt interest me very much.


And yeah Olicity, I never got that couple . it came out of no where and I dont see the chemistry"

But if we are talking about from the point of view of how our state is supposed to function,its doing its job by spying on other nations(more so their leaders,spying on random Germans is more messed up), but breaking the rules from spying on its citizens. That sort of the social contract we have with our government in the US.

Also from a law POV, why wouldn't it be illegal to out us spying on foreign governments?

Of course there is a line; going around stealing from or killing people of other nationalities isn't okay just because they're not Americans.Those are things he absolutely should report if he sees.
