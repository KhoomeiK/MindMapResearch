I'm trying to double major in gender studies and Japanese, but I'm feeling super discouraged knowing there's a very real possibility classes may be online this fall.  The gender studies work I can handle, but I actually ended up dropping my intermediate Japanese course this semester after we were moved to online because my professor more than doubled our workload to compensate for lack of in-person instruction. I was taking the class mostly for review (I placed into the class above it but I needed to brush up on grammar) so I figured I was better off studying on my own and not suffering the hit to my GPA.  That being said, I'm afraid I'll face the same problem if I have to enroll in advanced Japanese in the fall online while trying to get used to everything else.  I can't wait to take it once it's offered in person again because that would screw over my shot at being able to declare the major."

Random: I have a rare brain condition where there's not enough room in my skull for my brain and it causes migraines and other weird shit which is annoying but it's also really funny because every semester I must go through the ridiculous ritual of telling professors that I need accommodations because my brain is just too fucking big."
