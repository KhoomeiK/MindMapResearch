chanceme,fpif4ip,t1_fpi8x9z,1588639622.0,"a lot of colleges will be understanding about test scores and many are going test optional, so it's probably okay if you can't take them again.

i don't know much about rejecting EDs. i did hear that you can reject if it's not enough financially for you, but i think it's kinda risky.

the thing about colleges and financial aid here is that the government assesses what they think your need is (""demonstrated need"") through the FAFSA. many times, it's lower than what your need actually is. i'm middle class, and there's no way i could ever do $60k-70k a year. (that's more than half my family income man. that's crazy.) but the government says i can, so i got no need-based aid from anywhere.

so basically, you could receive an offer that the college deems as ""enough"", but it's not actually enough for you. in that case, you most likely can't reject the ED offer without incurring the consequences (not sure what those are, but it involves getting blacklisted or something? don't quote me on that). also, let's say barnard gives you some aid but the cost is still high for your financial situation, and another school just as good gives you a full ride. you're not allowed to even consider the full ride offer if you apply ED. this is why no one but really wealthy people ED to american colleges. i highly suggest you not ED.

i hope this helps!"
chanceme,fpidbmq,t3_gdivlt,1588638567.0,"hey! OOS ABC female cal commit here (L&S, intended CS major, specifically) who's also from a good ol' corn state.

disclaimer, i'm just one admit out of literally thousands. and while you're likely similar to me or stronger than me in some aspects, that doesn't guarantee anything. i can't give you any promises. but i can give you hope!

your stats are almost exactly what mine are and i also didn't submit subject tests, so you're fine there. if what others have to say about UCs being stat based are true, then that's even better for you.

my stats were good, don't get me wrong, but i was more proud of my ECs. the funny thing is that i think my ECs, at least on paper, would appear weaker than yours. this sub would call me generic\^2 (and i would too). i had similar levels of community service, similar school activities (i had more clubs on my list, but i didn't hold leadership so that doesn't matter a ton), maybe slightly deeper involvement in my ""sport"" (i was a debater all 4 years, captain my last 2, and was mildly successful in competition), and none of your work experience or music stuff. btw, music matters more than you'd think. true, you are asian, but deep involvement and decent talent in music (which, judging from the YO part, you have) still matters a decent amount. i have a few ABC friends who were deeply involved in music (definitely one of their biggest ECs) and they got ivies and Stanford. 

the ECs that stood out the most to me were the internship & asian chapter chair. that's relatively unique and all colleges love socially conscious kids. given berkeley's activist background, they might weigh it even more than other colleges. the nonprofit is interesting, but since you're starting it so late in high school, it kinda comes off as if you're only doing it for college. (of course, i still think you should continue through with it and if you grow it enough, it could actually be really good for your application. also, yknow, helping the less fortunate is just a decent human thing to do.) 

tl;dr we're pretty similar applicants and since i got in to cal, i think you've got a decent shot too. again, not a guarantee though. 

my suggestions - stay dedicated to what you already have on your plate. depth is more impressive than breadth. if you can take on more, connecting with professors & doing research and getting more work experience (internships) will help a lot. starting a side project is also not a bad idea. it doesn't have to be complicated (a fun bio-themed youtube channel or blog is an example) or related to anything academic; it could just be a random passion of yours. 

finally, work hard on your essays - they'll make or break it for you at all your schools. if you've got any more questions, my DMs are open. good luck!"

chanceme,fpi4ewm,t3_gdc6tk,1588633444.0,"hey! i’ve commented on other international chance-me’s and i figured some of what i said there might be helpful. here’s a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/gae3ed/chance_a_lowincome_international_for_t20s/foz79lp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and another [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/g9nrwb/reverse_chance_an_anxious_junior/fox1ihx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). 

off the bat, i’m really impressed with your applicant profile. your stats seem decent and your ECs look amazing. \*chef’s kiss\*. 

HOWEVER. 

you’re an international who needs financial aid and that’s where you run into a lot of problems. the vast majority of american colleges are NOT need-blind, meaning that if you need financial aid, they consider that in admissions and it’s a detriment to your application. american colleges like making money, and it’s a not-so-well-kept secret that international students generate a lot of income for many colleges because they often are made to pay full price. college admissions for you here will be really tough for you just because of that alone. (here's a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/62fyhPqVA6s) i watched awhile ago of an international applicant who found out about this firsthand.)

please don't give up though! i'm not trying to scare you away. i think you should just know what you're walking into. also, it’s not at all the end of the world! every year, some internationals get in and some get financial aid, and i can't see why you couldn't be one of them. your ECs are very impressive - your internships are really attractive, colleges love people who are published, and you show a lot of self-initiative and leadership ability. colleges value these traits a LOT. 

here are my suggestions to increase your chances of getting in (some i've done myself, others i've picked up from lurking on college forums) -

* use this [site](https://blog.collegevine.com/schools-that-grant-financial-aid-to-international-students-a-complete-list/). apply to the schools that are need-blind and to the ones that give a lot of aid (the site has a list and it shows average aid packages to international students). 
* i'd get your SAT score up (1500+) if you can, and continue taking the hardest classes you can.
* YOUTUBE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND! there's a lot of videos from international students who got into top schools, and even more videos about essays from successful applicants (many who read their essays out loud, which is super helpful because it lets you see the caliber of writing these colleges like). 
* the internet has a ton of free essay help. search for each specific school's supplements. many of them will have essay breakdowns and sample essays! 
* do NOT write about what you think colleges want to hear. more than likely, you'll come off as generic. 
   * i've heard that the best essays are 1. quirky/funny/unique (don't try to be funny if you're not though. only do this if it comes naturally to you and you know it'll be well-received) or 2. stories.
* you seem to be well-connected in the writing community. ask people that you respect to read your essays over.
* sign up for college email lists and (assuming you're using the common app) add them to your application fast (even if you're not ready to submit anything). schools will randomly send fee waivers. i've also heard that if you just ask for one, many schools will give it to you. (it's worth a shot; the worst that can happen is that they'll politely say no.)
* see if you can find some connections with college professors here. another international student i saw was working on research with a rice professor. connections are really helpful in the admissions process and they might be able to write you a rec, which would carry a lot of weight. 
* i see you want to ED somewhere - that might not be the best idea if you need financial aid. you'll probably want the ability to compare aid packages.

best of luck!"

chanceme,fp31ocf,t1_fp1dhnh,1588271570.0,"okokok i’m awake now. let’s go. 

preliminary disclaimer - my response is in the context of the really tough schools you have on your list. your stats, ECs, and everything are very good, but the schools you’re looking at are nearly impossible to impress. i apologize if the chance-me comes off as harsh, but i don’t want to sugarcoat my honest thoughts. 

so your GPA and rank seem pretty good (although i’m not familiar with the 100 system or how competitive your school is), but i’m kinda confused by your coursework. have you not been taking AP/honors STEM classes? i don’t see any STEM classes listed in your dual enrollments, unless i misinterpreted an abbreviation (side note, spelling out the full class name would’ve made this easier. i squinted at DRAM and SPCH for too long lol). unless your school doesn’t offer AP/honors STEM classes (which, judging by the calc AB you’re taking next year, doesn’t seem to be the case), it’s a little worrying that you’ve only taken regular STEM as an intended engineering major. or maybe you’ve been taking honors STEM and you just didn’t list that coursework. it still implies that you didn’t take the hardest classes you could’ve (i.e. AP classes). the colleges on your list - stanford, ivies, hard privates - want to see that you’ve taken the hardest courseload you could. your school has to submit a school profile that includes courses available, and they’ll know if you didn’t take the hardest courses. 

your ECs are good, but not super unique aside from sports manager. (side note, what does “sports manager” entail?). leadership positions are good,  but you don’t seem to have many ECs or any ECs that you’ve spent a lot of time (like years) in. and you quit the only major-specific EC you have (STEM club). this isn’t a great sign, because ECs are typically what helps distinguish an applicant. stats will open the door for you; ECs, essays, and LORs are what’ll get you through it. of course, how strong your ECs are is partially determined by how well you present them (like in essays). on paper though, in list format, it doesn’t look the best. 

please don’t take this to mean that you have no shot. admissions is always a crapshoot and everybody always has a shot. i still encourage you to apply to those schools! but i think you need to diversify your list and get some easier schools (as in, acceptance rate isn’t below 20%). as it is, you have no matches (schools with acceptance rates that low are never a match) and not a lot of safeties (besides UT Austin). you’ll want more options that are more attainable. also, work hard on your essays, take any hard classes you can, and maybe take on some engineering side projects or look into engineering-related activities. best of luck!"
chanceme,fp2y0i2,t1_fp1dpo8,1588269781.0,"jesus it was like 2 am when i responded lmao. i’ll leave a full reply as a reply to my original reply. 

you can retake the math if you really want to, but i honestly still don’t think it matters. a 33 is good and not very different from a 34, 35, or really even a 36. it’s a difference of like 5 questions at most. you’re not going to get rejected because of a low math ACT with a 33, and you won’t get accepted because of a 36 math ACT either. as far as i can tell, stats are there to make sure your app isn’t tossed in the first reading. they’re typically not the gamechanger when it comes to being accepted. essays are what makes it or breaks it for schools like the ones on your list. it’ll take you a lot of effort to study for a higher math ACT than 33, and it’s much more productive spending time on your essays. 

necessary disclaimer, i’m not an AO or college counselor so i could be wrong about the stats part. (i know i’m not wrong about essays being important though). i’m just a high stat senior who knows a lot of other high stat seniors, and i’m basing my perception on the role of stats in college admissions on my own admissions experience and what i’ve heard about others."

chanceme,fp2vq71,t1_fp1bpb4,1588268683.0,"i’ll give a more high energy reply now that i’m awake and have seen OP’s response about having low self-confidence. 

your ECs are, full stop, crazy. really good. so good that i scrolled past your first post because i read it and i was like “yeah, this guy’s fine”. they’re pretty unique because they demonstrate a deep interest and passion for your major. most kids don’t have any ECs like that, or if they do, it’s not to the level of national & international awards and research presented at conferences. colleges love major-specific ECs and they love big awards & research even more. bonus points if the research is good, and it got published or presented (so basically, your research). 

your stats are also decent. they’re not the highest, but they’re high enough to where you probably won’t get rejected for stats. and your ECs definitely counterbalance your stats for any schools who’d find them low. 

basically, i think you’ll probably get in to at least a couple of your schools on your list. don’t ED with those stats if you don’t have a dream school (which you don’t appear to) - you’re going to be sad as hell if you end up getting into (ideal world) JHU, Penn, and Yale and you don’t even get to choose because you ED’ed.

(please keep in mind my advice about low matches though.)

chanceme,fp2u7jm,t1_fp264ff,1588267961.0,"i don’t know biology very well as a major so i can’t really list any specific schools, but every school you have listed has a <20% acceptance rate, which makes them all reaches despite the strength of your application. don’t get me wrong, i’d be super surprised if you didn’t get into any of them. but i think you ought to look into some easier schools, where perhaps you’d the strongest student there. they’d likely give you money, honor’s college, potentially even special internship/mentorship/networking opportunities.

i’m a CS kid so i’ll give a CS example. i view UW Madison as a med-low match for strong CS applicants. its CS program is good (better than like half the ivies or something), but its acceptance rate is probably somewhere between 35-50%. 

i know right now, you might think you’d never take up a “lower” college over any on your list. don’t pigeonhole yourself to that though. i myself almost accepted a full-ride offer to my low ranked and relatively unknown state school because of all the perks it offered, and i’m still debating (a day before May 1) whether i want to go to Madison or UCB for CS. and one of my regrets in the college process was that i didn’t apply to more matches. i also know someone who got a perfect ACT, crazy GPA, and fairly decent ECs. everyone thought they’d go somewhere crazy prestigious, but they ended up at A&M because they got a full-ride package with a bunch of other perks. 

basically, it’s always better to keep your options open. it won’t even take a ton of effort for you to do so, since you can probably recycle one of the many *many* essays you’ll have to write for your toughass school list for your apps to easier schools.

as for ISP specifically, i know nothing about it but i have some insights that could apply. since it’s an accelerated program, it sounds like you won’t have a lot of time off (as in, no summers), similar to an accelerated 6 year med program. from what i’ve heard about accelerated med program admissions, they’re particularly interested in students who’ll be able to handle not having time off (the specific program i know of asked rec letter writers about the student’s ability to work through summers). if my assessment of ISP’s correct, then your research in the summer, online classes (summer & school year), and self-studying will help a lot in showing them you can thrive in that program.

chanceme,fp0nb8r,t3_gai0pu,1588212749.0,"hey! i have like no experience with your major but i have some thoughts that might be helpful. 

first off, your ECs are definitely the shining part of your application. i don’t know the film/communications world, but it looks like you took every opportunity possible to get involved in film & communications at your high school, which is fantastic. you also seem very accomplished. if stats didn’t matter, i’d say you have a really decent shot. 

your academics are probably where you run into trouble. like the other comment, i’m also confused how your UW is higher than your W, but i’m going to assume you accidentally mixed them up. you’re mostly applying to state schools and they weigh academics pretty heavily, *especially* at texas state schools. UT Austin probably weighs it the heaviest of all, although perhaps it’s slightly different for the film/communications school. if you have extenuating circumstances for your grades, try to put together an explanation and supporting documentation (like a letter of explanation from your counselor). if you don’t, it’s okay. keep studying to get your test score up (i think UTs care more about score than anything else? maybe? don’t quote me on that) and try your best to get higher grades from this point forward. showing an upward trend will help. 

in the meantime, i’d say look at more private colleges and maybe some more reaches too. private colleges are probably more willing to let your ECs counterbalance your stats. and for reaches, your school list doesn’t seem (?¿) extremely difficult (disregard this statement if the film/communications school/major is hard at some of your schools) and i’m always of the opinion that it’s worth shooting your shot. keep it up with your ECs and self-driven projects too. i hope it all works out for you! good luck :)"

preliminary side note, saying t100 is kinda odd and misleading (but it’s not at all a big deal lol).

your applicant profile is actually really interesting and unique. i’m not sure how much weight the AOs will give the wilderness, equestrian, skiing, and sailing stuff without any significant awards, but i do think it’s pretty cool. AOs will at least see that you’re a well-rounded person with several passions that you’ve shown admirable dedication to, and being unique is always a good thing in the college process. your ECs also show a lot of self-initiative, which colleges find attractive. the second thing that jumped out to me (after the horse girl part) was the website you made - that’s super cool, and i think colleges will agree with me. 

your academics (classes & GPA) are solid, but you probably already knew that. you’re not going to get rejected for your GPA. however, your test scores are a little low for some of the schools you’re applying to and in comparison to the overall strength of other areas in your application. i’m no stickler for stats but a 28 ACT/SAT in the 1300s is low enough to potentially be trouble at the selective schools on your list. i’d definitely work on getting them up. if you want a specific number, i think a low 30s ACT/1500s SAT will keep you out of trouble. 

overall, i like your school list (a good mix of schools) a lot. i’m not super familiar with the less selective ones but you’re probably a shoe-in at illinois, colorado, and utah (unless your specific major is really big there, which i wouldn’t know). you’re a strong applicant, so i think you’ve got a decent shot at the most selective schools on your list if you get your test scores up. (note: it’s not at all a guarantee though, because no one’s a guarantee at those schools. if i put it another way - you should definitely apply, but don’t auto-assume it’ll be an acceptance just because you’re a strong applicant.)

first of all, you likely already know this, but your ECs and academics are crazy. i really like your essay topic too. HOWEVER, you're still not a shoe-in anywhere (except probably Arizona and Amherst, if that is indeed how MA works). would i be surprised if i heard you got rejected from all the selective schools on your list? yeah, for sure. but these schools are so, so, SO selective and there's enough extraordinary applicants out there for some to lose the roll of the dice. my point is - you're a really strong applicant and i think you've got a good shot at all your schools, but statistically speaking, it's still more likely that you don't get in than if you do.

i don't say this to discourage you! but walking in thinking that you're guaranteed admissions will make the rejections sting a lot (at best), and it might make you complacent and indirectly cause you to not try as hard (at worst). 

now that that's out of the way, here's some random advice. i really like your current essay topic; colleges love kids overcoming hardship and as long as you write it correctly, it won't come off as generic. you might want to consider though (if not for your common app essay, your supplementals) writing about your passion for STEM in some way. (i think you're smart enough and that you have enough potential essay material to write about STEM without seeming generic or one dimensional).

chanceme,foz8gr6,t1_foz6671,1588186431.0,that’s pretty interesting. it does kinda spread you thin if you’re looking at schools for each major though.
chanceme,foz84ac,t1_foz607p,1588186265.0,"ah well, toc finalist is still toc finalist. i’m less inclined to personally fangirl, but that doesn’t really mean anything (lol). 

i can’t speak much about congress specifically because it’s a speech event in my circuit. it’s also mostly a joke, with only a select few treating it seriously. to be fair though, those select few tend to be the same kids who are top debaters in LD/PF/CX and hey, those are the kids going to ivies. it’s still pretty impressive and i imagine being good at congress at a competitive level still brings a lot of clout college-wise."
chanceme,foz79lp,t3_gae3ed,1588185863.0,"hey! 

first of all, please be careful! i’m not sure if you regularly look at this subreddit or have seen some posts from others about this, but some people on here are toxic as shit and crazy. you sound like you’re really easy to track down and people have been threatened on here before. i suggest not leaving this up for too long. 

anyways, i don’t think you need me to tell you this, but your ECs/awards are nuts. crazy. bananas. amazing. still though, you’re an international student who needs aid and the vast majority of american colleges aren’t needblind for internationals. that makes it really tough for not-millionaire internationals to go to school here. that being said, american colleges value research and prestigious awards (so basically, what you have already) a lot. selective colleges like T20s do take some internationals and give aid to them, and i think if they’re going to pick someone, i think it’d be you. don’t be mistaken - you’re not a shoe-in at all. but you are very impressive and you’ve got a good shot. 

advice - 

• work HARD on your essays. they make it or break it for every applicant to really selective schools. 

• search online for schools that give international students aid - the first link should give a full list with average aid packages. 

• apply to the few schools who’re need-blind for internationals. the same link should tell you which schools are need-blind. 

• definitely keep at it for your physics A-level; i don’t know how A-levels work but a C sounds pretty low and you are trying to major in physics. 

• you said you’re on a gap year - most colleges want to know what you did during it. if you don’t already have an impressive response lined up, i’d start looking for things to do. take on a side project (don’t know how possible that is for physics/math) maybe, get involved in research for the summer, do community service. hell, write a book. just do something to show colleges you did something with your time off. 

best of luck!"
chanceme,foz3l9u,t1_foz379q,1588184103.0,"i just noticed the spread of majors you have going (lmao, why so many that are so different?). 

any public policy school would love to have you. for your other potential majors, your lack of major-specific ECs might hinder you a little but honestly, debate skills are good wherever you go and colleges know that. also, i got ucb with like maybe half a teaspoon’s worth of major-specific ECs and maybe a tenth of your debate creds, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
chanceme,foz379q,t3_gadh5v,1588183918.0,"lol wtf toc finalist? that’s hot. but also be careful, this sub’s got some toxic people and it sounds like it’d be really easy to track you down. you might want to consider only leaving this up for a little bit of time. 

i don’t think you need me to tell you this, but your stats and ECs are nuts. i’m gonna focus on the debate part because seriously, wtf. 

colleges go crazy over good debaters in my experience. my circuit’s not a competitive national one - mostly lay local circuit but still decent. every year, the top debaters (like top 6ish) in each debate get ivies or similar top tier schools. (now whether that’s because of debate or because of the type of people top debaters tend to be, i can’t say. i’m guessing both.) i think your chances are pretty decent at the top schools on your list. definitely higher than your average strong applicant (lol, that makes no sense but i think you’ll get what i mean.)

BUT please keep context in mind. i don’t want to give you the impression you’re a shoe-in because nobody (seriously, NOBODY) is a shoe-in. statistics aren’t on your side REGARDLESS of how strong of an applicant you are. 

anyways, on the ED/REA thing - personally i wouldn’t ED with those stats unless you REALLY like that school and you wouldn’t consider another school if you got in. since you already said you’re leaning towards Yale REA, it sounds like what i just said doesn’t apply to you, so i’d REA to Yale. put another way - let’s say ideal/dream world, you get all the most selective schools on your list (improbable but also still a possibility, given your crazy stats). i sure wouldn’t like my ability to choose between penn, yale, harvard, and stanford being taken away because of ED. at the same time, if you already know what your choice would be, then ED would help you secure it. best of luck!"
chanceme,foykt6s,t1_foxfsnu,1588174314.0,"thanks! and yeah, that’s definitely a good idea. i’m pretty sure schools in not-america are also significantly cheaper (not cheap still, but you go from $50k tuition to $11k in many cases). 

it’s really difficult honestly to tell what a match & safety is for internationals. i’d start with a site like [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.collegevine.com/schools-that-grant-financial-aid-to-international-students-a-complete-list/amp/), which tells you which colleges are need-blind for internationals (it’s only like 6 and they’re all selective af, but some of those poli sci programs are top-tier). then i’d probably look for some lower ranking schools (as in, they might not even be t75 or t100) on the list that give aid, because those schools tend to be THIRSTY for accomplished students like you. also, these schools are still good; they just don’t have any prestige and probably aren’t as well-connected, but the education is still worthwhile.  

not to say you shouldn’t be looking at good schools and good poli sci programs still! it seems like you’ve already found some, and this list probably will give you some more that’ll also give fat aid. i hope this helps!"
chanceme,fox1ihx,t3_g9nrwb,1588131860.0,"i honestly don’t know if i should tell you this because i don’t like discouraging people and i’m rooting for ya, i really am, but...

international students who need financial aid have a really REALLY tough time with american college admissions (as far as i’ve heard). your application is really crazy (like seriously, wtf) and if you were domestic, i wouldn’t hesitate to say that you have the highest chance one can have for admissions to a selective college. but from what i’ve heard, a huge difference between international & domestic applicants is that colleges are NOT need-blind for international applicants. that’s going to hurt you a lot. 

colleges here like making money. it’s a not-so-well-kept secret that international students generate a ton of revenue for a lot of colleges because they pay full price. don’t let college financial aid brochures fool you - most aren’t very giving. i’m upper middle class (domestic) and everyone i know is around the same, some lower. none of us can afford a full $75k a year, but the government thinks we can and as a result, schools give us no need-based money. you definitely meet the bar for merit aid, but i’m not sure if you’d qualify as an international student. 

please don’t let that stop you from applying though! it doesn’t automatically mean they’ll reject you or that they’ll give you no aid. i’d just encourage you to apply to as many schools as you can, particularly to some lower ranked “safety” schools. you’re definitely a strong applicant and you so deserve a place at a top university here. i wish you the best of luck.

*side note: thank you for organizing your post extremely well and making it so easy to read. i wish every chance-me post was formatted like this."
chanceme,fowy8ma,t1_fown1zf,1588129746.0,"that’s really interesting and honestly kinda noble. you don’t see many kids going to college for just knowledge. i can respect that reasoning a lot, although i also think it’s worth noting that if you want to go into business & finance as a career, i’m pretty sure you’ll need a degree to land a job. the recruiting at college is also probably important. i’m no Wall Street expert but i’m guessing business/finance isn’t like CS, where you can be self-taught and still work at Google. 

at the same time, it sounds like you could just retire now so hell, you probably don’t need a job anyway. either way, i wish you the best of luck in your pursuits."
chanceme,fowxnea,t1_fowiujx,1588129378.0,"a bit of both. you do have a good chance, but at this level, you always wanna just shoot as many shots as you can. some will probably land, many will not, and it’s near impossible guess which shots will and won’t land. 

from what i remember about what you posted, your ECs were pretty crazy and your stats were pretty high, to the point where if i heard you’d gotten into one of the schools on your list, i’d be happy for you but not at all surprised. (the default response to hearing about someone getting into those schools is surprise, in my book.) 

however, you said it yourself - these are extreme top schools. they’re hardass schools and *extremely* selective, and statistics aren’t on your side no matter how strong of an applicant you are. and when i say you have a “good chance”, that’s NOT a guarantee. no one’s ever a guarantee at these kinds of schools. so the more options you’ve got, the better chance overall you have of actually going somewhere really good."
chanceme,fow815v,t1_fow6sne,1588114722.0,"ahh i can understand that for sure. still though, Georgetown social sciences and law is tough to beat. if you get in, i don’t think distance/location should be the only reason you don’t go. best of luck!"
chanceme,fow5g02,t3_g9e87v,1588113355.0,"the low ACT math score is kinda concerning since you're looking into CS. i'd definitely try to get that up.

your ECs and stats otherwise look pretty decent. i think you've got a shot at all of your schools, but the schools you're looking at are all super tough and like the other comment said, unpredictable. please consider more low matches and some safeties.

also, for CS, there's a lot of universities whose CS programs are better than the prestigious privates and ivies that are currently on your list. UIUC, UT Austin, U Washington, UMich, UW Madison, and at least 4 of the UCs (UCB, UCLA, UCSD, and UCI) are the ones i can think of off the top of my head. i'd definitely look into some of those and consider adding them to your list. if you really want private prestige, toss Cornell, Stanford, and USC onto the list. if you don't want to apply to too many schools, every school i just listed (except maybe for UCI and Madison) has a better CS program than duke, harvard, neu, and yale. good luck!"
chanceme,fow43vy,t3_g98a4b,1588112651.0,"your ECs are pretty nuts and you can write some really potent essays about them. your stats aren't the strongest, but if you can get a 1510+, it should be enough to where you're considered. i think you've got a really decent shot at your schools.

chanceme,fow2s8c,t3_g9f9ln,1588111953.0,"first off, do i think NU is a safe bet, ED or not? hell no. it's always a crapshoot at selective schools. always. 

now that that's out of the way, i think you're kinda crazy for EDing with those stats and ECs period. no one's ever a shoe-in anywhere, but i think you'll probably land at least one of the hardass schools you're applying to and it'd be sad if you couldn't even consider that school because you ED'ed somewhere.

if your decision about EDing or not comes down to your odds of getting into St. Anford, i think you've got a shot for sure. EDing somewhere else because you think you don't seems silly to me. also, i'm pretty sure applying REA does help statistically. i read somewhere that the REA acceptance rate is like double the RD. of course, the party line is that there's no difference acceptance-wise between REA and RD, but numbers say otherwise.

good luck!"
chanceme,fow0oiz,t1_fovz7st,1588110866.0,"also real quick - i see you plan on taking AP CS Principles as a senior. don't. you already took AP CS A.

chanceme,fovz7st,t3_g9uvx4,1588110122.0,"hey! i’m not very familiar with the schools and programs you’re shooting for, but i also applied CS last college admissions season and idk, i just have some thoughts that might be helpful.

(warning, i’m going to try really hard not to trivialize your experiences/struggles/life, but it’s difficult not to use language that does that in the world of college admissions, so i apologize deeply if i inadvertently do.)

first off, you seem like a pretty strong applicant. you have a lot of hooks (racial minority, low income, and sorry if this is prying, but are you first gen?) and if i subscribed to the college board's cringey and problematic use of an ""adversity"" score, you'd probably score pretty high. your grades look pretty good (although i'm not familiar with how the 100 GPA system works) and your ECs show someone who's well-rounded. more specifically - you tick the ""leadership positions"" box, you're involved in community service (shows colleges you're a good person), and you seem to have a passion & dedication for the arts (i.e. you're not a typical STEM one trick pony). 

i can understand why you're not super sure about your ECs because they're not necessarily super unique, but they're still decent, especially for a student with your background. (cringe phrasing, sorry, but i'm pretty sure that's how AOs will see it.) the only ""weak spot"" in your application might be that you don't have a ton of competition-related ECs (ex: sports, MUN, debate) or CS-related ECs, but it's difficult for low-income and minority students to participate in those activities and your AOs should recognize that, so don't worry about it.

i think you've got a decent shot at all the schools on your list. no one's a shoe-in at the more selective schools on your list, but you have what it takes to get in.

to make your application stronger, i'd shoot for an ACT score in the low 30s (31-33), but don't worry about it too much if you don't get a score that high. (side note, vassar is apparently [going test-optional](https://stories.vassar.edu/2020/vassar-waives-standardized-tests-for-admission.html). i'd still send one if you're worried about your grades not being high enough (i don't know vassar's academic profile at all, so judge this for yourself) and/or if it's a generally good score.) spend a LOT of time on your essays - they'll make it or break it for every applicant at the more selective schools on your list. and for CS, schools like to see kids doing side projects and programming in their own time. 

some more school recs - Rochester Institute of Tech gives good money. i also think it's worth shooting your shot at some ivies - Cornell specifically is good for CS and in NY. ivies have a lot of money and i think if you get in, they'll give you a lot of money. for RPI, look into whether your school participates in the [Rensselaer Medal](https://admissions.rpi.edu/aid/scholarships-and-grants/rensselaer-medal) program. it's a fat scholarship if your high school nominates you, so it's worth seeing if they can do it. the deadline's really soon though - May 1.

good luck!

\*edited to talk more about your ECs, since you seem unsure about them."
chanceme,fovgtyh,t1_fovge0j,1588101080.0,"for some more hard (but not hardass) CS schools - UMich, Georgia Tech, & UT Austin aren’t nearly as difficult, get good recruiting (Austin’s startup scene is crazy), and their CS programs are pretty good; UIUC CS is hard but more doable than the ones you’re looking at and they get a lot of top tech recruiting; U of Washington is really good (and that seattle tech scene is NICE) but crazy selective for OOS. 

also, if you’re already looking at Stanford and UCB, might as well look at MIT & Cornell too. 

good luck!

*edited for readability and redundancy"
chanceme,fovge0j,t3_g9s0ii,1588100868.0,"*disclaimer: my response is contextualized for the hardass schools you’re looking at. your stats and ECs are impressive, but the schools you’re looking at are extremely difficult to impress. 

your ECs are alright, but most of the schools you’re looking at would prefer more CS-oriented ECs and more leadership positions. the one that sticks out to me the most is the mobile app. developing any app in general is really good on its own, and if it’s impressive coding/demonstrates coding prowess, even better. keep doing side projects! make a website to showcase them and that’ll get you pretty far. 

your ACT score imo is the most worrying part of your app. i’m not one to be a stickler for stats at all, but your M and S scores are significantly lower than the scores at the schools you’re looking at. not the end of the world because stats aren’t everything, but i would definitely get those scores up since you’re looking to go into CS.

you’re looking at some extraordinarily difficult schools. i think you have the grades to make it in, but your ACT and ECs aren’t quite up to par. fortunately, you’ve got time to work on both and your essays will also matter a lot where you’re applying. these schools are tough, BUT admissions are random as hell and i think if you can get your ECs and ACT up through studying & side projects (respectively), you’ve got a shot."
chanceme,foveg95,t1_fov801n,1588099947.0,"their ECs are objectively good, but looking at their school list and where they’re applying, there’s going to be tons of applicants with significantly better ECs."
chanceme,fove0s2,t3_g9nywi,1588099742.0,"i agree that your ECs could be better, but it’s never too late to start working on some projects on the side. you’re a strong applicant still though - when i say your ECs could be better, i’m contextualizing for the hardass schools you’re looking at. there’s a lot of schools out there who’d love to have you. 

first off, UIUC engineering is almost never a match. i don’t think UIUC shows a *ton* of preference for in-state either, unlike other state schools. MechE is definitely not their most competitive, but it should still be pretty tough. 

i’d look into UW Madison as a low match (medium-size Capitol city, enormous school spirit and bigggg sports). i know their CS department is good and that tends to translate to engineering too. it’s also just a good school in general. 

UMich has a great college of engineering and they’re big on sports & school spirit. city is kinda small though. i’d call it a med-high match (lol that sounds weird, but you know what i mean) for your applicant strength. 

Georgia Tech is worth looking into - i’d call it a high match. *Cornell’s a good reach or “mega” reach. And if you’re looking at the UCs, UCB is probably better for engineering than LA. 

i’d also recommend looking into more tech schools (schools with the word “technical”, “technology”, or “poly technical” in their name) for good matches & safeties that’ll give money. there’s some in New York that you might like and California’s also got a lot. good luck!

chanceme,fouw89q,t1_fouiy20,1588091424.0,"wait seriously?? you might be right, but the article i read on their official collegiate newspaper says it’s just test-optional? although i guess they could be interpreting test-optional differently from other schools..."
chanceme,foswcxt,t3_g8u5o8,1588039418.0,"UCB admit here (it’s berkeley, btw :p )
your stats aren’t bad enough to “override” your kinda crazy ECs. i’m never going to say anybody’s a shoe-in to a school like ucb, but you have what it takes to get in. essays are important, and then it’s kinda luck of the draw from there. 

side note, i am kinda surprised you’re not going for some kind of finance/business major - i think your biggest “draw” (the $2 mil in trading) would be a much bigger draw if you were applying in that major (and also, you’re already really accomplished in that field, so why not go to school for it and go even bigger?)."
chanceme,fosvkh9,t3_g9a5c1,1588038942.0,"real quick - test optional is NOT the same as “not taking ACT/SAT scores”. it should mean that they’ll still take them. 
i just wanted to point this out because under the test-optional model, if you don’t submit a test score, they look closer at your grades & GPA. so if your grades aren’t the best, shooting for a good test score will help counterbalance that. your grades seem to be mostly As, which isn’t bad, but depending on how high your score is and/or how worried selective they are about grades & GPA, you might want to consider submitting a test score anyway. 

also side note, putting a list of all your classes and grades is kinda hard to read :/

UCSD also has a pretty good CS program, albeit not t10 in the country though. 

i’m not at all trying to discourage you from applying; i think you should still go for it. but don’t let anecdotal evidence of someone with a supposedly “weaker” application getting into a school give you a ton of hope. that was a big mistake of mine, and i got really disappointed at some of my rejections because of it :/

i’d get your SAT up for sure, and then just continue working on projects on the side like you already have. (don’t obsess too much over the SAT; i’d say if you can get into the 1500s, you’re fine. stats will get you looked at, but ECs and passion projects are what’ll get you in.) you’ll have a decent shot at UW and Purdue if you do that. (note: not a guarantee. i’m just a high schooler; i can’t say you have a guarantee anywhere). as for the rest of your schools, they’re really tough BUT don’t let that discourage you! admissions are really random (seriously, they’re so random), so keep your grades, write some really killer essays (and have people you trust look over them), and shoot your shot. good luck!"

chanceme,fo89c5z,t3_g55kzo,1587592255.0,"hey! i’m here from another post that you read. 

off the bat, i’m impressed with your stats (altho i don’t know how the 100 GPA scale works. your GPA seems really good tho) and ECs but they’re not extremely unique? that sounds really harsh but the other comment isn’t wrong - other kids will look the same, at least on paper, for the applicant pools where you’re applying. NOT THE END OF THE WORLD THOUGH. it just means that your essays and any new activities (that you choose to take on now) will have to be what makes you stand out. 

i think about it this way: you tick all the boxes for a strong applicant, but every strong applicant needs something to get the figurative signature at the bottom to be admitted. so maybe if your involvement in your ECs is really meaningful to you, then make that clear in your essays! my ECs seem pretty generic on paper (capt of speech and debate, senate president pro temp at my state’s girls state, & president of a tutoring organization for an underserved community are the most notable ones), but they meant a lot to me and i made that clear in my essays, which i think is what helped me stand out to ucb. (i don’t know what you wrote about in your essays but if your counselor likes them and you trust them, that’s a good sign). 

the best way though, imo (and it’s always the first thing that stands out to me when i see other chance-me posts), is to get involved in the field you want to go into. the earlier and longer you get involved, the better. you already talked about getting an internship/research experience - great! but don’t stop there! take on side projects, do some research of your own, show that you enjoy doing it on your own time! showing passion for your field is attractive to colleges - passion is what’ll make a great scientist/engineer/whatever, not necessarily a 36 ACT. 

that’s slightly more difficult for chemistry probably; i’m assuming you don’t have your own state-of-the-art lab or anything. but maybe you can start a science blog and post about fun experiments you do. (starting any kind of website/blog/channel to show your passion is a good idea in general imo, not just for science). enter science fairs and competitions. if you’re chill with your chem teacher, use their lab and maybe even partner up with them to look into something that interests you. for engineering, coding projects on the side are good (making a website for them is even better). if you have the materials, tinkering around and building your own things isn’t a bad idea either. 

really, the possibilities are endless. anyway, this is a really long comment (lol kinda my specialty at this point) but i hope this helps! 
by the way, these are all just ideas. it’s not at all necessary to do every one of them or even any of them. if you have the time and energy to do more though, this stuff is what i’d suggest. just don’t burn yourself out :)

also, don’t freak out about the ACT; 34/35 is very good and at the schools you’re looking at anyway, no ACT score will ever impress them, not even a 36. i can speak from personal experience on that one - i have a 36 and got rejected at a lot of top public schools anyway (didn’t apply to many private). it’s better to spend time on your essays and ECs, which in the end is what matters. at the schools you’re looking at, the best your stats can ever be is “satisfactory”; there’s no limit though to how good your essays and ECs can be. 

good luck! you got this :)"

chanceme,fnzqxkh,t3_ftwf0n,1587399174.0,"hey i’m here from the other chance-me post where i posted a super long comment. i’d say a lot of the same things for you that i did in that one, honestly. 

a 3.6 UW is NOT bad. that’s mostly As with some Bs (or at least that’s how it works at my school, dunno if that’s the case for you). now for california kids in a competitive high school (which seems to describe you), it might seem horrific. but you gotta remember that crazy competitive cali schools are not at all representative of the applicant pool at most schools. 

getting your test score higher (which is probably easier than raising your GPA) will definitely help counterbalance your GPA *for the schools where a 3.6 is below average* (i emphasize this because seriously, a 3.6 isn’t bad). and when application time comes, you have some good ECs to focus on for your essays. it’s clear you have a passion for engineering from your dedication in robotics AND that you’re a good person from your involvement in the off season. as long as you actually did this with a genuine interest and NOT just for college, you should be able to write a really nice essay about that. engineering schools want smart kids, which stats is a part of, but they also want good humans who’ll use their degree to engineer something great. your deep involvement with the tabla also shows that you’re well-rounded and ~cultural~ (and 7 years is a pretty long time, shows dedication and that it’s genuine). 

now that i think about it, i’m not very good at actual chance-me’s, I just like calling people out for overlooking their strengths (lol). if i look at your schools and try to do an actual chance-me - i’m not super familiar with most of them. from the little i do know, your list of schools look pretty solid? although if the other comment about UCs having a minimum GPA cutoff for the first round of app review is true (which i personally don’t think it is, they say they do “holistic review” and GPA cutoffs don’t fit into that approach), you should look more into their average GPA ranges and make sure you have a safety that you’re confident in. if you don’t, find one. also, UIUC has a very very *very* competitive engineering school, which makes it a really big reach for just about everybody. i’m not saying you don’t have a chance though, because this is college admissions and heck, everybody has a chance. 

tl;dr work on your test score, at least maintain your GPA, *stop comparing yourself*, and come application season, focus on your passions in your essays and apply to schools confidently, as if you’re a 4.7/36 student. insecurity won’t help you go anywhere. you got this! :)"
chanceme,fnzlhx1,t1_fnzgp1j,1587396348.0,"haha thanks for the congratulations! i was honestly really surprised. but another long comment for ya (bc i really wish i’d told my friends this sooner). 

man the level of competitiveness is even worse than i thought. in that environment, yeah i’d be freaked out too. i imagine that you don’t really get a chance to hear about “normal” people in that environment (lol). for most people, 1 C/“only” a 4.4 GPA (jesus that’s higher than mine and i thought my GPA was pretty good) isn’t the end of the world, and as for 4.7-5.0 people getting waitlisted, it’s not because their stats weren’t good enough. at worst, it’s because they had no ECs (wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the case, nobody has the time to both study for a 4.7-5.0 AND have good ECs) and/or bad essays. at best, that’s another fantastic example of how much of a crapshoot college admissions is. 

dual enrollment is good; you’ll start college with credits and a transcript with a good college GPA (assuming you got good grades in them, which i think you said you did?). and if your first time applying to college doesn’t work out next year, you do have the option (i’m assuming you’re from cali) of going to a CCC and working on your college GPA so you can transfer into a good UC. there’s always hope, but you won’t find it in all the people who only see the worst (i.e. the devastated 4.4/1 C/waitlisted 4.7-5.0 people). keep your head up and you’ll make it! :)"

chanceme,fnywsjj,t3_g4plax,1587378601.0,"i’m always going to be more optimistic than most because i think i got hella lucky in my own process (somehow netted ucb) and i have friends who also scored unexpectedly high, so take my comment with a grain of salt (tbh you should for every comment on Reddit). 

the only part of your stats that seem “questionable” to me is your GPA, and you have a partial explanation for that one. i don’t know the SAT very well (ACT kid) but i think your score is kinda nuts, since it’s 40 off from perfect, and high test scores do help counterweight not-as-high GPAs. your ECs are where you shine though. you show passion and involvement in your major (stocks), and you’re pretty good at stocks too if you’re making a few thousand off it. you’re involved in your community and you’ve got initiative (founded a club). assuming that the club and your stock activity are actually meaningful and not just something you did for college, you can write some really potent and fantastic essays. 

i think you should add more reaches, personally. i’m not very familiar with all your schools on the list but they don’t seem (?¿) that hard? (please don’t come for me if they are, just let OP know in the replies nicely). i’m also of the opinion that you just gotta shoot your shot at *as many places as you can. college admissions is super random and a literal crapshoot.

*i don’t mean apply to 20+ colleges. i do think you can afford to go for more though. you’re only planning 6 apps rn with that current list (UCs are all one app, i view it as one school for app purposes), which is respectable but doesn’t let you shoot a lot of shots."
chanceme,fnyvtwo,t1_fnyvb3w,1587377575.0,"i forgot to include a detail about my friend’s Rice story that really shows how much of a crapshoot this process is. my stats are significantly better than hers and my ECs are at least the same, probably better too. i got waitlisted. i also did apply late (deadline extension) and my friend is an amazing essay writer (whereas my essays were hot garbage because i was too burnt out to write them well), so this isn’t a “i deserved to get in and she didn’t!” point, this is a “stats aren’t everything and college admissions are so random, so shoot your shot” point. expectations help ensure your college list isn’t all reaches, but it shouldn’t also limit you to the degree that you’ve been limited. 

anyways, i hope this gives you the hope you’re looking for. good luck!"
chanceme,fnyvb3w,t3_g4n6yb,1587377023.0,"ok i’m sure your parents are wonderful people but it sounds like you’ve got some intense asian tiger parents with unrealistic expectations (judging this from “asian female”, “400k+”, and “they don’t think i’ll get in anywhere”). 

i have so many friends (asian friend group, mostly nerds and studious students) who think their stats are trash because all their friends have crazy stats (i think my friend group has 4 people with 36s) it or because their asian parents who went to peking university expect ivy-level stats. it sounds like you’re suffering from a case of comparison woes, judging from the “this subreddit is so smart!” comment, so i’m here to set you straight. 

when i heard trash stats, i expected sub 3.0 GPA, (never took SAT and don’t really know what qualifies as good/bad so i’ll use ACT), sub 25 ACT, etc. (i’m going to assume you genuinely think these are bad stats and not someone fishing for compliments because i want to see the world as a good place, but if you are actually just fishing, then you can ignore the rest of this comment.) your GPA and test scores are not ivy-tier, i’ll give your parents that much. but a *high 3/projected 4 GPA (side note, how do you have that with “6 Cs” on your record? i don’t really know how your school system works but that seems off to me) and high 1300s/predicted mid 1400s SAT is very respectable and not at all “trash”/“not getting in anywhere” level stats. it certainly doesn’t warrant you not applying *anywhere* out of state, and if you’re willing to shoot your shot at ucb, then you ought to widen your horizons more. there’s plenty of mid-tier private schools who’d give money for that. 

also, in my personal opinion, stats don’t really mean shit and from what i can tell, as long as you meet an unspecified minimum bar at a college, it’s your essays/ECs/LORs that matter. 4.7 GPA/36 ACT is nice, but it’s not very different from 4.5/33 and it’s practically nothing in the face of a 3.8/32 with extraordinary ECs. stats matter, but not that much. 

you know what’s really nice? lots of community service that isn’t generic and shows passion (which you have, the tkd involvement is really good) & a clear dedication to improving your community (which you definitely have with the covid-19 non-profit. also shows self-initiative too). to me, you sound like a really good person with the drive and will to make something of yourself and colleges *really* value that because they want famous alumni. drive and will are what make a Steve Jobs, Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, etc, not a 4.7/36. 

anyway, wow this comment is a lot longer than i anticipated it being. i just have a lot of feelings about your situation bc so many of my friends are like you haha. i have a friend with similar stats to you (similar GPA, ACT in low 30s) and good (but not necessarily great) ECs, who thought the same of her applicant strength as you did. in my opinion, that hurt her confidence and subsequently her college list too much. she ended up getting into Rice (but can’t go due to financial reasons). i really don’t want you to be like her. in my opinion, college is all about shooting your shot. you’re going to miss a ton, but odds are that you’ll net something. 

i write this comment as a current senior who got rejected from most of my schools, but then got a surprise acceptance to ucb (rejected at la and didn’t get my major at sd, very weird). literally, college is a crapshoot and you can’t predict it, so don’t hamstring yourself by closing doors before you even approach them. shoot. your. shot. you got this :)

CompetitiveTFT,fmyauq1,t1_fmv59sg,1586481912.0,"Definitely not a top 1 comp and imo it’s pretty inconsistent. Jinx is like a worse version of Kayle and even Jhin imo, because of how long it takes for her to come online. 3 star Jinx often isn’t enough to win (which sucks). As a result, the win con (imo) is the same as Kayle comps: 2 star MF with decent items. But if I’m going to need 2 star MF with decent items, I might as well run Kayle or Cybers instead and enjoy a more consistent run. 

That being said, I think Jinx has one advantage (albeit it is pretty small). Jinx 3 with proper items (QSS, GS, Guinsoo’s/GS/Red Buff) is one of the only units I’ve ever seen that could successfully kill a mech with all the proper 3 stars and good defensive items. In my experience, Kayle 3 and Jhin 3 both can’t do crap against a really fat mech, but Jinx 3 c h u n k s."
CompetitiveTFT,fmya6jc,t1_fmv42nu,1586481478.0,"Disclaimer, I don’t have a ton of experience with the comp. I’ve played maybe 10ish games of it in norms and 1-2 in ranked. I’d play it more if it weren’t for one glaring problem: it’s SO vulnerable to infiltrators. Since you have to position Vel up further in the third or second row to hit the backline and you don’t have other ranged units in that comp (besides TF, who gets blown up in a second) to distract the infils, Vel just gets mega fucked in my experience. Since Vel always moves the ult too, he never focuses it long enough on the mech. 

Sure, you could get around the infiltrators themselves by positioning, but you almost certainly screw yourself against all the non-infiltrator players since positioning against infils likely means moving your Vel back, which in turn ensures that you don’t kill the Jhin/Kayle/Jinx in the back before they kill you. As for the inability to kill the mech, short of finding a Vel 3, I have no idea what to do about that. (I know Vel 3 is the win con, but the 2-3 infil players in every lobby are going to take you out before you can find that.)

Note: I freaking love this comp and think it’s super fun. I just don’t find it viable for ranked. If anyone has any suggestions on how to get around these issues though, I’d really appreciate them!"

Mort’s tweet stated that the order is typically full items on board > components on board > full item on bench. However, a thread on this post stated that it didn’t work that way for them. What happened instead was full items (regardless of bench/board) > components. Is this just the case for this patch, because it’s a bug?
