UCSD,fmwsk8b,t1_fmwoudy,1586452276.0,I wish they would just tell us officially as opposed to leaving us hanging (and still charging us that ridiculous commencement fee)

UCSD,flxxkk5,t3_frmu9x,1585591728.0,"I got an email from my department about the etiquette, it may vary by class or professor but this is what ISP had to say:

>	As we transition to an online environment for Spring 2020 classes, it is important that we maintain a professional atmosphere for the benefit of everyone in the class. For all your courses (major and non-major)  follow these guidelines:
1)     If you are in the continental United States or corresponding time zones, your instructor expects you to be on time to and present in class in real time.
2)     Choose a quiet place to connect to the class.  Turn off your phones, and make sure your microphone is muted upon entering the Zoom environment and during the class. Depending on class size, your instructor will either allow you to speak at any appropriate time or will ask that you raise your hand as allowed electronically by Zoom.
3)     Have your full name displayed as your profile name on Zoom.
4)     Your physical appearance should be appropriate for our professional environment.  You should  use a non-distracting  background. If your computer allows a virtual background, that is fine. Otherwise, a plain wall or empty room will be best.
5)      Have your camera on for the duration of the class.  This helps your instructor read facial expressions as they would in the classroom and adjust speed and content accordingly. 
6) To the extent possible, avoid interacting with others in your physical space. Even if you are on mute, it is very distracting to see people moving around and talking during a class. If you can, choose a space where you donâ€™t encounter distractions, which could include family members, laundry, dirty dishes, or a busy street outside your window.
7)     Be mindful that if you are using a public space to â€˜attendâ€™ class, your camera should be turned to avoid capturing non-class members. Classes will be recorded  after notice is given at the beginning of every class. Bystanders do not have the opportunity for consent.
8)     To ask a question, you can either raise your hand-icon or write a question in the chat (note that questions can be publicâ€”for everybody to seeâ€”or directed only to the host). If you raise your hand-icon, the host will direct you to unmute your microphone.
9)     Be respectful of others.  Follow your instructorâ€™s directions on how the class will be managed so that people are not speaking simultaneously or interrupting each other."
