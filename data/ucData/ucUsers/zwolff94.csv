NintendoSwitch,fplkqi7,t3_gdwg4p,1588714468.0,Have this game on Wii but never finished it. Feel like i'm just going to re-but i one switch to be honest.
oscarrace,fp7ljqw,t3_gbjycs,1588372915.0,I'm sad that Spotlight and 12 Years a Slave went before Birdman. Birdman is a better film in its technical production but the story has lots of issues.
UCI,foxb47t,t3_ga1ycn,1588138779.0,Do you have a qr code for this sweatshirt?
oscarrace,fow38sc,t1_fovvc61,1588112192.0,I'm okay with this tbh. It's been a few years coming imo.
NintendoSwitch,fopwnld,t1_foprx0k,1587974630.0,Okay that looks absurdly fun. I am going to work on Mario post game for a while but that looks like a game I'll be buying soon. I honestly wish there was an RPG like this. There sorta is in Kingdom Hearts but not on switch and much more linear. The in-between of open world and linear progression works so well for me personally.
NintendoSwitch,fop1952,t3_g8chlf,1587950859.0,"Is there any games similar to Mario Odyssey (just finished main story) in the level design, in that they are somewhat linear but also a lot to explore and do asides from main missions? Doesn't have to be a platformer in fact if there is any sorta action/adventure game similar that would be preferable."
oscarrace,fooyuy1,t1_foo7e8s,1587949384.0,Yep Shape of Water should have been gone by now.
comiccon,fo8oisv,t1_fo876t7,1587600636.0,Very true. I need to look into it more as I bought for me and a friend. I don't know if I can do refund for her and not me or vice versa. Also I only had a day (Thursday) and was on Volunteer list and was going to use that for Friday and Saturday and I haven't heard if Volunteer list is transferring over or not. All of this is stuff I need to know before July 1st tbh.
comiccon,fo828se,t3_g68oii,1587588611.0,July 1st is not nearly enough time. I get that they want to figure out how many badges they are going to have but especially without knowing if we can be part of returning registration for 2021 (not likely) that's not enough time imo.
Switch,fo7mj7t,t3_g5r6mh,1587580881.0,I almost got one of the bundles and didn't at last second and ended up lucking out with Best Buy instead.
oscarrace,fo7k861,t3_g62xhm,1587579746.0,"Am an island on Shape of Water? It is not a good movie. Well made sure, but not good. The story and characters are just flat bad a lot of times."
NintendoSwitch,fo4sml9,t1_fo4r3xt,1587510421.0,Keep trying for full switch on Best Buy if thats what you want (that is what I did and my switch is minutes to hours away from delivery) but I know people who love the lite. Think if you value playing on the TV or not.
oscarrace,fnzya1l,t1_fnzq7sz,1587402842.0,I need Shape of Water gone before Birdman personally. I hate Birdman but it's not a bad film. Shape of Water has some serious issues though.
NintendoSwitch,fny1k7i,t3_g45v88,1587351187.0,"Little confused by everything so I'll ask here, in handheld mode there is no reason I can't use the official Google Pixel charger (cord and power brick) correct?"
NintendoSwitch,fnuln5e,t1_fnuk7yd,1587265062.0,Shield/Sword is newest Pokemon game and a traditional game. Lets Go are a bit different (havent played them) in that you don't battle the pokemon in the wild to catch them making them a bit simpler thatn Sword/Shield. Up to you ultimately.
NintendoSwitch,fnir94k,t1_fnir2ah,1586984957.0,Save your shipping/credit card info. That way you can quickly checkout next time. I had everything saved luckily on my account.
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fnioaom,t3_e3ufk1,1586983460.0,Should I buy Xenoblade Chronicles 2 or wait for Xenoblade Chronicles 1 DE when I own Xenoblade Chronicles 1 Wii disc?
NintendoSwitch,fniis2g,t1_fni3yz4,1586980714.0,You honestly just have to keep trying. Idk why the system is that way but I was able to get one yesterday that should be here in a week.
NintendoSwitch,fni5niz,t1_fni4u91,1586974397.0,"I'll be honest neither have I fully but I know a bunch about them. Most of what I know FF wise comes from KH. That said 7-10 and 12 are all on the Switch. 7-9 all use the iconic ATB system and are all between 16-21 USD, 10 has a very traditional turn based system and its sequel uses the ATB system, 12 uses I think a real time turn based combo kinda like Xenoblade from what I know. None of them connect so  I'd honestly just take a look and see which one interests you and jump in."
NintendoSwitch,fni3vyt,t1_fni111c,1586973533.0,"Assuming you've played all the classic FFs? Those are also huge time sinkers and will be closer to the turn based of Person 5 then say Xenoblade, which is only my list personally but it is hugely complicated system from looks of it. Dragon Quest XI I have heard great things about too and is traditional turn based. These are all games I'm considering myself but haven't played so hopefully someone who has can answer but just putting in my two cents."
NintendoSwitch,fnf7n21,t1_fnf71mr,1586902906.0,And seriously just keep looking. I was able to order one this morning on Best Buy.
NintendoSwitch,fnf5lbx,t3_g13hnn,1586901819.0,Will Animal Crossing and Smash Bros fit on console? I have one the way (got lucky on Best buy) and want to get those two games to start. Will order an SD card also most likely but don't want to wait if it ends up coming afterwards.
NintendoSwitch,fneqtta,t3_g1c8zl,1586894207.0,"Just keep trying Best Buy (assuming US) and you can get one. I'd given up hope and tried again today and got one.

Edit: Just ordered it but so far assumption is it will be here next wednesday."
oscarrace,fndzwzn,t1_fndvjao,1586880583.0,Decent chance. Up and Inside Out are from same Director (Peter Docter) who also wrote both and we're nominated. He also was nominated as story for Toy Story and Wall-E.
Jigsawpuzzles,fn7d9t1,t3_fzwg9v,1586718057.0,I immediately knew it was liberty puzzles. I've been to Boulder three times and love it there and their store is awesome. I have one and plan on getting more when they reopen.
thewestwing,fmm42a3,t1_fmlv8vq,1586198400.0,Yeah that was going to be my suggestion.
DisneyPlus,flteal3,t3_fqwbq3,1585469177.0,"So based on Letterboxd which allows you to sort by service if you have pro access it is in fact Endgame (3hr 3m). The next films (not counting the 3 hr Arendelle yule log) are Sound of Music (2hr 55 min), Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End (2hr  49min), Avatar (2hr 44min), and rounding up the top 5 is Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2hr 32 min). Of interest (maybe) longest Disney cannon animated film is Fantasia (2hr 6 min) and longest Pixar is Cars 2 (1hr 57 min).

Edit: Endgame official time from Disney+ added"
