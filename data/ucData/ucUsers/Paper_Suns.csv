dogs,fpiwsp7,t3_gdmmyk,1588650571.0,"I use to go to a dog park that wasn’t managed well. I don’t go there anymore since my dog is reactive after an attack. But it was next to a children’s park and we would have children COME IN WITH NO PARENT, because their parents were on the phone or distracted, and come in and run around with the dogs. I’ve seen children pull at random dogs tail or taking toys from a dog (not a good idea). It pissed me off because the children could get hurt, and they can hurt the dogs. Children who have gone in dog parks with their parents aren’t much better. Running around, screaming and chasing dogs. Don’t bring your children in period."

dogs,form7e5,t3_g96tys,1588014590.0,"When I rescued my dog she was so scared of men that she peed out of fear whenever one came by. I do think that your dog has some trauma that is triggered by your gf. From your post it seem that it’s only sometimes that this gets triggered. Look for things she’s wearing, maybe she tied her hair in a different way or made a movement that reminded your pup of their past. If you take your dog out and she barks at other women see what’s similar between her and your gf.

It may get discouraging but keep at it and it’ll happen one day. The methods you’re using are good, tasty treats and a calming voice goes a long way. 
You got this! And thank you for rescuing :)"

dogs,fn1drbk,t3_fym3wl,1586559908.0,"I hope you’re okay! I have a reactive dog and when she scuffles with my friends dog, the only dog she likes, it feels like my heart drops. 
It’s really a learning process because each dog will have something they want or don’t care about. The assimilation process is just learning which dogs like what, they’re quirks, what they won’t care about ect. Like who gets fed first, who cares about a specific toy and who doesn’t. Hang in there, you got it. You’re such a wonderful person for adopting dogs out of a lab."
