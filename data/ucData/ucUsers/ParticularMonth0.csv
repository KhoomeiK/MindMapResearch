UCSantaBarbara,fpib8bt,t1_fp7208u,1588637353.0,Universities are literally one of the riskiest places for disease spread.
UCSantaBarbara,fpib44k,t1_fp6ydjm,1588637287.0,They need to have an option for students to do everything online.  People can’t afford this.
UCSantaBarbara,fpiayoo,t1_fpbrrbu,1588637197.0,Think of these idiots when folks have to go back into quarantine.
UCSantaBarbara,fpia5jb,t1_fpei0o4,1588636731.0,Boomers think that because back in the day they could afford to go to school to party.
UCSantaBarbara,fpi9ybt,t1_fpeoqmg,1588636616.0,UCSB is no longer a party school.
UCSantaBarbara,fpdl8il,t1_fpbot16,1588529195.0,Maybe ask the prof for time adjustment?
UCSantaBarbara,fpd7971,t3_gclf9m,1588521290.0,"Universities have expenses that have also skyrocketed (e.g. cost of pensions, healthcare, executive salaries).  The maintenance of the physical grounds is expensive.  The cost of legal compliance is incredibly expensive.  To provide education at a lower cost they would have to provide services on par with a community college."
UCSantaBarbara,fpc0kr2,t1_fp4ptvz,1588483852.0,Students need to lobby to make sure we are accommodated.  What does half online even mean?
UCSantaBarbara,fpc0igp,t1_fp4kyst,1588483798.0,"Hybrid in what sense?

Will lectures be online and labs be in person?"
UCSantaBarbara,fpby4vi,t1_fp6sg97,1588481828.0,They need to have accommodations such that all classes can be taken online.
UCSantaBarbara,fpby1cr,t1_fp7zadr,1588481750.0,"Not for classes, since lectures are still too big.

I think labs and research will open soon."
UCSantaBarbara,fpb4dbq,t1_fp6wc8a,1588461854.0,"I think they will have to accommodate students on this.  E.g. those that are in the area will be able to do in-person labs, those who are outside the area will be able to do them remotely.

Labs with the full number of students can’t social properly anyway."
UCSantaBarbara,fpb22xj,t1_fp917ch,1588460481.0,"The party school reputation is outdated at this point.

Most students are fairly serious."
UCSantaBarbara,fp6mivy,t1_foxdx79,1588354892.0,Please email the professor.  They might not know how stupid they are being.
UCSantaBarbara,fp6mbfr,t1_fp46pvy,1588354791.0,Thanks.  Which students get that?
UCSantaBarbara,fp41eds,t3_gb2kgt,1588289787.0,Refund for what?
UCSantaBarbara,fp2roy8,t1_foyzuu3,1588266768.0,The overwhelming majority of folks at UCSB do not look like models or even health nuts.  They are pretty average folks.
UCSantaBarbara,fp2rixw,t1_foyyhxq,1588266687.0,"TBH the party school reputation is waaaay overstated and outdated.

UCSB has people from all walks of life (and sizes) and most students are focused on succeeding."

UCSantaBarbara,fow8tlw,t3_g9xcf4,1588115145.0,I think some people are planning to live in IV anyway (even if fall is online).
UCSantaBarbara,fovw6ft,t3_g9vbi9,1588108582.0,"Tbh I don’t think they will have in person lectures for fall.

I do think they will allow staff to go to their offices, maybe small labs, etc.  It will be a hybrid."
UCSantaBarbara,fouu4vg,t3_g9hi89,1588090441.0,There are no UCs that are a majority of any one ethnicity (except I think UC Berkeley might be slightly majority Asian).

UCSantaBarbara,foopus7,t1_fol855x,1587943936.0,"It really probably won’t be back to normal.  However, you can still have a lot of the college experience by going to IV and to campus."
UCSantaBarbara,foopown,t1_fokiuuv,1587943840.0,"Everyone needs to tell them to cut down the work.  They think online classes are “easier” for some reason but it’s not true.

Everyone demand an ease in workload if it is too much."
UCSantaBarbara,fojqzhh,t3_g7lab0,1587827529.0,"If possible it is always better to do weeder and/or lower div classes at CC.  The quality of instruction is better, the atmosphere is better, usually there are no rules where only 10% can get an A or whatever.  It is also much cheaper.

Just check to make sure classes transfer first."
UCSantaBarbara,fogoc3u,t3_g7d82f,1587755082.0,This is actually not such a bad news.  It sounds like you will be able to go to campus.
UCSantaBarbara,fodqsft,t1_fobg4nv,1587688367.0,The UCSB community is pretty inclusive.  Anyone bashing anybody in a racist manner would face harsh punishment.  We are also not stupid enough to think that all persons of Asian ancestry are COVID-19 carriers.
UCSantaBarbara,fodqewy,t3_g6ac3h,1587688165.0,How should we plan given that fall might be online?  Just wondering...
UCSantaBarbara,fodqa1u,t1_fodoowp,1587688092.0,I absolutely agree.  Students across the country need to negotiate for loan forgiveness.
UCSantaBarbara,fodq7ib,t1_foca90j,1587688051.0,Complain to the department until they negotiate with you.
UCSantaBarbara,fodq36m,t1_fod66da,1587687984.0,That is ridiculous.  Students should negotiate for the lowest HW scores to be dropped or for the grade to be curved.

Also you can take a class in summer to make up units."

UCSantaBarbara,fo8hkzq,t1_fo6ucmy,1587596700.0,"So how do you think things would be going if they did nothing?  People would be too scared to go to restaurants, travel, etc."

feedback as well."
UCSantaBarbara,fo8h04u,t1_fo76f36,1587596377.0,I’m not saying they’re doing a bad job.  I’m saying that it is hard to get compliance.

UCSantaBarbara,fo6tahm,t1_fo5o9z9,1587566318.0,"There are so many people out and about, no precautions, etc.  Given that the dept. of public health states that 50% of people in SB county are not sheltering in place, and given that flue season starts in November, we I think we can expect online classes for fall.  

They might compromise in lab sections, research and small scale activities.  But given how little people are following the rules it not looking good."
UCSantaBarbara,fo6su2d,t3_g5w517,1587566065.0,We need to start writing emails to administration to ask about this.
UCSantaBarbara,fo6btkh,t1_fo5mnzw,1587553966.0,No because they’re worried about the next flu season which starts in Nov/Dec.  Can you imagine if people get sick with this during finals?
UCSantaBarbara,fo6bp24,t1_fo4hakm,1587553842.0,Report it to Chegg ASAP (and any other platform).  Write professors to lobby for P/NP.
UCSantaBarbara,fo6bklp,t3_g5wo5i,1587553717.0,"Since social distancing will probably be in place for some time, and people are not following the rules, we probably will be online for fall.  However, a lot of folks might want to live in IV anyway."

They will be shocked when quarantine is extended and we have to do social distancing until like 2022."
UCSantaBarbara,fo6b7r8,t1_fo4s9qt,1587553362.0,Other schools are already doing it.
UCSantaBarbara,fo4q9gx,t3_g5p8oq,1587509135.0,They need to make the exams long/hard enough that answers will be unique.  Then they can tell who is copying.

This is ridiculous."
UCSantaBarbara,fo46rjm,t1_fo3iuek,1587499155.0,Is that because they think fall classes will be remote?
UCSantaBarbara,fo46fca,t1_fo43ahe,1587498989.0,"Everyone: please, please email your professors if you’re having difficulty.

They have no idea how hard it is for some students.  They need to be made aware."
UCSantaBarbara,fo3vdq7,t1_fnzyr33,1587493580.0,"By fall they should be able to offer it online.

I think students should pressure the department to waive the requirement or offer a substitute.

Side note:  is it possible to take the class at a CC or is it only offered at UCSB?"
UCSantaBarbara,fo3tjd1,t3_g5au5w,1587492702.0,Also please be aware fall classes may be online.  I’m just saying this to warn people.
UCSantaBarbara,fo3teu7,t1_fo35j85,1587492641.0,"Look, there is basically a plague and an economic collapse going on.  Students have to study at home, and that is terrible for many.  

Accommodations must be demanded and made.

Some professors are thinking online is easier, but it is just not true.

Send emails and Zoom messages communicating this.  We need to organize!"
UCSantaBarbara,fo3t2ex,t1_fo3l4o2,1587492482.0,"It is totally stupid and the students need to keep pressuring their departments.  Write emails, message them on Zoom.  Organize.  That’s how other colleges got changed to their policies.

Students need to consistently tell professors when the workload is too much.  There is basically a plague going on and the economy is crashing.  Students are (rightly) stressed out and need to be accommodated."
UCSantaBarbara,fo2twwx,t3_g5bu6s,1587473990.0,They can’t see it because students don’t communicate.  They don’t email their professors and departments.

UCSantaBarbara,fnzcnr3,t3_g4htum,1587391387.0,"I think it will be sometime in 2021 (hopefully the beginning).

This is because social distancing will still be in effect through the fall."
UCSantaBarbara,fnzc6mw,t1_fny12qk,1587391097.0,Going to IV to do the online classes there would be better.  You want to make progress on your degree.

UCSantaBarbara,fnza6m1,t1_fnz480b,1587389843.0,"These are good points that are often missed.  I just don’t think UC could afford a COVID-19 outbreak.  One case could cost them millions.  That is why they have to be extremely careful.

I think universities should be the last to go back to in-person format.

My guess is that maybe in 2021 they can start bringing some labs back (with low numbers of students where they can be far apart).

Lectures, large events and the like will not be back until there is a workable treatment or vaccine."

TrueOffMyChest,fnoyudt,t1_fnoxbmf,1587136186.0,"You sound like a standard mainstream thinker who is convinced she is a liberal because she parrots stuff she heard on CNN.  Flooding labor markets and depressing wages for the working class is not liberal.

How is one million legal new Americans fair to the average worker?  Wages have been stagnant for decades while executives and investors have dramatically increased their wealth.  Much of this has come from pocketing the gains from lower wages.  Much of this has also come from the destruction of unions.  Neoconservatism and neoliberalism do not work.  

If you are working or middle class and you support mass immigration, you’re voting against your own interests, just like the dumb conservatives who love corporations and hate government."
TrueOffMyChest,fnovo3a,t1_fnom168,1587134475.0,"Ah, that social Darwinism conflicts with the ethos of democratic socialism.

You want a government that cares for its people, yet you dismiss those who “cannot compete?”

UCSantaBarbara,fnom485,t3_g30qpi,1587128734.0,This is a great question.  I hadn’t heard about this—we should email administration about it.
UCSantaBarbara,fnolzlp,t1_fnlzkhs,1587128644.0,It’s remote learning or shut down the university.  At least we get remote learning.

They still have to pay salaries and benefits, they still have to maintain the campus, and they making no money (actually losing money) on housing.  

Meanwhile they have had to purchase new online systems and programs for remote learning.  

We should be glad they are letting us progress with our degrees instead of shut down completely."
TrueOffMyChest,fnogyua,t1_fnhfo69,1587124729.0,"I hate those as well but when you have every culture, creed and ethnicity on earth represented there will be inequality and massive amounts of infighting.  The human race has a very poor track record for being kind, that’s for sure.  This constant conflict means it will be extremely difficult to get policies like those found in Sweden.  Who benefits?  The oligarchs.

I view Americans as abused people.  They are told they get the best of everything, but they’re really just getting ripped off right and left.  Lower-income Conservatives are particularly bad at voting for their own interests.

In my opinion the misogyny problem in the US is getting hideous.  I have no words for it.  

Still, liberals consistently support mass immigration, which (along with conservative support for abuse of visa programs) creates social discord and impoverishes those in the lower classes.  How would you like to have an extra hundred people compete for your job, your spot in school or your housing?  That’s what the working poor face every day."

UCSantaBarbara,fnog6b9,t1_fnnks6j,1587124019.0,UCSB is better for research.  Cal poly is better if you want to go straight to workforce (or perhaps double with engineering).  Both are amazing locations.
UCSantaBarbara,fnog2q6,t1_fnnamri,1587123929.0,"Basically they can make the test hard enough so that students can’t cheat.

But that involves work: essays and short answer problem solving.  Multiple choice are terrible for online classes."
UCSantaBarbara,fnofye9,t1_fnm51mp,1587123821.0,"That’s true, so it might be a wash.

However, maybe student could be compensated by extending privileges past graduation.  Maybe extra grants could be given to those students who need it.  Hopefully the food pantry will stay open.  There are ways we can help make this better for everyone."
