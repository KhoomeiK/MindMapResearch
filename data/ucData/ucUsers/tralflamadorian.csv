REU,fo3hv2f,t1_fo37q5z,1587487165.0,"That’s awesome! Thanks for that info, makes me feel more hopeful. Hope you have a great summer!"
REU,fo0xywf,t1_fo0xqq6,1587421891.0,"Ughh it’s the waiting that’s killing me! All of the uncertainty with these REUs, summer in general, school in the fall maybe being online, etc is super stressful."
REU,fo0vi5r,t1_fo0u3bo,1587420539.0,"Sweet that’s great, that’s what I was hoping for! I was curious to hear about other programs to see if people had more info. Really hoping mine isn’t cancelled cuz I’m a junior and it’s my last year to do one"
REU,fo0j3gy,t1_fo0hyza,1587414050.0,"Oh interesting. I guess I’m just hoping the long wait means they are trying to find an alternative to cancelling, which sounds like what’s happening in your case!"
REU,fo0f5ak,t1_fo0dli5,1587412002.0,They said they’d let us know by the end of April. Just seems super late to still be waiting. Was wondering if anyone else was in the same boat

REU,fnce638,t3_g0wryd,1586834586.0,Wow thats so cool! What a great compromise. Have an awesome summer!!
