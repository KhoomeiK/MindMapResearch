stopsmoking,fo3chuj,t1_fo2hv1x,1587484535.0,"nothing wrong brother. stay strong. nicotine, smoking, is all poison. there‚Äôs going to be damage to your lungs and your brain is going to start getting upset there is no nicotine. quitting is a difficult process, but everyday that you beat cravings, cravings will be easier to deal with. everyday that you breathe pure oxygen, the better your lungs will feel and heal. your lungs will get better and stronger, doing deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, and then slowly transitioning to weight lifting/cardio, can help your lung capacity greatly. be careful w nicotine withdrawal, you must continue staying strong. some of it is just mental, ur brain is trying to trick u into thinking that you need nicotine to function. you don‚Äôt need nicotine, just a will to live. god bless."
