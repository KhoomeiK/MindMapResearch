anime,fnfoyeq,t3_g11v1d,1586912439.0,"Really liking it so far! I'm not watching any franchise heavy-hitters or sequels this season, which is a nice change of pace from my usual viewing habits. (For reference I was keeping up with 6 shows in Winter, 4 of them being sequels/continuations)

Right now it looks like I'm sticking with:
-Kakushigoto
-Sing Yesterday for Me
-BNA
-Listeners
-Balance:Unlimited
-Gal & Dino
-Tower of God

I feel like there's a lot of genre variety this season and the shows are a lot stronger than I was expecting, it's a welcome surprise"
