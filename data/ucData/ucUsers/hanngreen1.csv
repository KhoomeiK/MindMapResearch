UCSantaBarbara,fph6o91,t3_gd7rsg,1588615911.0,"Like most rental companies in IV, be prepared for them to try and keep all your deposit at the end of the year"
UCSantaBarbara,fph0g22,t3_gdf85p,1588612773.0,Bc you don‚Äôt talk
UCSantaBarbara,fp93uoc,t3_gc1rsk,1588413291.0,"No dorm on campus will be substance free, even the substance free hall lol. Like someone said, best bet is to live with others who have the same lifestyle habits as you if possible. Who you live with freshman year makes or breaks the experience really"
UCSantaBarbara,fp4e2b1,t3_gad7tb,1588297065.0,"There aren‚Äôt very many overweight people here tbh. That‚Äôs because like others have said, lots of kids here are very health conscious. So you‚Äôll meet a lot of outdoor enthusiasts, surfers, intense exercisers, and vegans. My friends who have said that this is ‚Äúintimidating‚Äù have just been unusually insecure"
UCSantaBarbara,foyvlw3,t3_ga4h8l,1588179997.0,"Living in FT during the Thomas Fire. Scary asf waking up at 3 am to an alarm and having to walk down long, dark hotel hallways half asleep. Scary times"
UCSantaBarbara,foyu5s3,t3_ga5m14,1588179227.0,Amazing news!! Def didn‚Äôt expect to get that much...thanks ucsb <3
UCSantaBarbara,fort20u,t3_g8si3a,1588018016.0,"For sure make a FB, even if it‚Äôs just for school purposes. This will connect you with a lot of students for various reasons like housing"
UCSantaBarbara,foldie9,t3_g831g5,1587859916.0,"No one knows, best to keep your hopes high though"
UCSantaBarbara,fo9gmq2,t1_fo5p0z7,1587618978.0,It‚Äôs does! My thighs have never been as toned biking back and forth from ft to campus
UCSantaBarbara,fo9g8oe,t3_g6ei8o,1587618664.0,Went back to iv today and saw wayyy more people out than I expected. No one was even social distancing it looked like because there were so many large groups
SkincareAddiction,fo4fcve,t3_g5hw1u,1587503406.0,"As someone who babies my skin, I refuse to pay more than $30 for specific types of skin care products. Drug store cosmetics do the job just as well as the expensive or ‚Äúluxury‚Äù ones‚Äîwhich you‚Äôre mainly just paying for the name and pretty packaging most of the time."
UCSantaBarbara,fo1771c,t1_fo0qqjv,1587427149.0,I miss smoking with my housemates
news,fnyfqoi,t1_fnxxuhd,1587361750.0,"It‚Äôs true, I didn‚Äôt realize how important daily social interaction was for me. Now the highlight of my days are getting to talk/video chat with my friends and professors from college"
AskWomen,fnnco8r,t3_g2gu99,1587089346.0,"I realize I just like my space, so naturally this comes off as me being hot and cold + aloof. All of my past bfs have given me shit for not being ‚Äúclingy‚Äù or super affectionate but I make up for it in other ways lol 

I‚Äôm a pretty creative, eccentric person so I realize it will be a long time before I have a normal relationship. Guys /guy friends will be interested and express wanting more, but I typically prefer platonic-like, casual flings. Since getting out of an usually intense relationship in which I had a hard time getting over my first real love I‚Äôve just been taking time for myself, not having high expectations of the guys I date and hang out with. I try to be honest about not being able to offer commitment. But, I have been itching to seriously get back into the dating scene so that‚Äôs gonna be fun üòã"

UCSantaBarbara,fmfu624,t3_fuw1kk,1586034913.0,I‚Äôm also fortunate enough to be able to graduate with no debt. Financial aid + merit scholarships cover well over half of my expenses; my parents cover the rest. UCSB has been really great with providing a reasonable amount of financial aid making it extremely affordable for me to attend.
