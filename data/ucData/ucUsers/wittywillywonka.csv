* Expand testing and doing contact tracing for those who test positive
* Being able to protect California's most vulnerable populations, including seniors, homeless individuals and those with compromised immunity
* Ensuring medical facilities are equipped to handle potential surges
* Working with research hospitals and other research partners to pursue therapies for the virus
* Making sure businesses, schools, and other public spaces can continue physical distancing
* Being able to return to more strict measures, as needed

berkeley,foe10e8,t1_fodz4l3,1587693922.0,"I don't think the Data100 minor pathway actually requires that you take Math 1B. I read the policy as basically ""you should be comfortable with two semesters worth of calculus and some linear algebra"" before taking Data100. So I think it's possible to still declare the minor, take Data100, and brush up on some concept on your own.

I think that line exists because Math 54 is technically a co-req or pre-req of Data100. But it doesn't seem like pre-requisites are really enforced (as in you likely won't get kicked out of the class for signing up without the necessary pre-reqs)."

Thanks for this hilarious post which raises awareness against this terrible firm."
berkeley,floicov,t3_fpocoq,1585338868.0,"Congrats! I assume this is also the case for Stanford, but there are plenty of opportunities at Berkeley to combine an interest in politics and CS. Although plenty of people double major in PoliSci and CS or PoliSci and Data Science, I would really recommend the Public Policy minor run through our grad school. It gives you the chance to take small, graduate level classes and really get to know your professors. Also being able to code gives you an upper hand getting quantitative social science research positions, even if you are just a CS major. 

As much as I love Berkeley, Stanford has a lot of ""big names"" from politics (including several prominent IR scholars). So it may be easier gaining connections through professors. Also, many college internships in politics are unpaid, which is unfortunate. Both Berkeley and Stanford have programs which help students working in government take on an unpaid internship, but it seems like Stanford has far more grants and scholarships in that area.

In terms of vibe, I personally love Berkeley for its lively energy, and diversity of people, landscape, and ideas. No one really buys their way in, and the school is a huge engine for social mobility."
