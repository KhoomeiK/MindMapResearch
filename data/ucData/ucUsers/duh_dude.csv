Sinusitis,fpcdscn,t3_g8n5ah,1588496750.0,Chronic sufferer here. I’ve tried just about everything but allergy shots. That’s my last hope at this point.
Sinusitis,fpcdkm6,t3_em0zyl,1588496513.0,Went through with a septoplasty and turbinate reduction. Felt better for a month or so and now it’s been around 8 months later and my sinus has gone back to being chronically congested again.
GERD,foprj8o,t1_footyhz,1587969817.0,"Fairly acidic. Lots of rice, meats, and dairy. Im starting to incorporate more alkaline foods today."
GERD,foprhbt,t1_fop7cnv,1587969769.0,Yeah actually Im leaning towards LPR but Im not sure. Have you noticed any difference by switching off acidic foods?
GERD,footdwb,t1_foo6dc9,1587946059.0,Yes Im thinking since it affects me mostly at night when Im lying down its due to the acid being able to creep up my throat.
GERD,footdg7,t1_fooji0y,1587946051.0,Somewhat frequent acid reflux
GERD,foot1s2,t1_foom3ro,1587945854.0,Yea I have nearly constant post nasal drip. Always clearing my throat.
GERD,foo1kkz,t1_fonv50b,1587930691.0,"Not very often I’ll give the pillow thing a try. That said, I’m fairly certain that the congestion is only marginally better when I get a fresh pillow. 

Happens all year long. Even in other houses, hotels, etc."
GERD,foo19zo,t1_fonz3tj,1587930527.0,Nope no medication.
ucr,fo4ileq,t3_g5mmvt,1587505082.0,Michael Cruz (Bcoe) was making me wait 15 min and when I came in saw PokemonGo open on his phone.
marvelstudios,fn65kqc,t1_fn63t8w,1586688303.0,Yea don’t blame the Reddit hivemind on this one. Captain Marvel was just god awful.
OverwatchUniversity,fmunseq,t3_fxb875,1586395081.0,"Hi I’m also kinda Jew (half Jewish) and I think the problem we have is that we get overly distracted by about getting the gold. I always try to get as many gold medals as I can, even when I play Soldier or Hog I often catch myself trying to get Gold healing on top of the other golds I already have."
pennystocks,fmqwy2j,t3_fwtpbd,1586308856.0,"From what I can tell Accummune isn’t a drug it’s a supplement. The ingredients to it listed on their website are just a mixture of vitamins and supplements you can buy off the shelf. 

“also helping to quell the excessive lung inflammation that can lead to the harsh symptoms and even death associated with certain respiratory infections.” -from their website

Seems like they’re trying to hint at being a solution to Covid while knowing they don’t have a leg to stand on. That looks like a major red flag to me."
pennystocks,flmtcnk,t1_fllfrpv,1585295796.0,Isn’t oil getting cheaper which is good for mining?
