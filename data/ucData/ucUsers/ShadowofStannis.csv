summonerschool,fohia09,t3_g7hngs,1587766440.0,Orianna plays relatively well into most matchups allowing her to be picked often. She also has amazing wave-clear which dopa utilizes extremely well as much of his play style emphasizes wave management. To top it off she scales extremely well while playing great in team fights. But if I had to pick the main reason it would be her amazing wave management.

summonerschool,fo8tkdw,t1_fo8tb0f,1587603552.0,Will definitely try riot support didn’t even know they helped with this kind of stuff
summonerschool,fo8tidk,t1_fo8tb0f,1587603519.0,Yeah I have haste. It has helped a bit but it’s still nothing playable consistently
summonerschool,fo8s4zw,t1_fo8rxle,1587602706.0,I seem to spike to around 150-200 for around 30-40% of the time. Believe me I would not at all mind a constant 60 ms but it’s the frequent spiking to 200 during crucial plays that gets me

Accounting,fn3m6uz,t3_fz58i3,1586623518.0,I would stay an accounting major. You would definitely not be at a disadvantage for investment banking as they really value candidates with a strong understanding of how the financial statements function. This also leaves the door open to public accounting as it sounds like this is also something your still considering. If you are not going to a target school investment banking can be difficult to break into but given your strong interest/grades I'd heavily suggest networking as much as possible now to have a chance at breaking in.

Accounting,fmuyxi1,t3_fxjrab,1586402041.0,"This is at a UC. Our biggest event is the fall Meet The Firms which is a recruiting event for Juniors/seniors looking for summer internships. We then do a following Meet The Firms in the winter for Freshman/Sophomore trying to do SLPS. We also have weekly events where we bring in professionals from firms in audit/tax/consulting that talk about various topics and stay after to network with the students.Recently we started doing social events (about 10 a year) at various restaurants where the club members are able to interact outside of a recruiting environment and able to meet fellow accounting majors.

Biggest takeaway to attract more members to your weekly events is to bring great food. We always have chik fil a, pizza, etc and announce our upcoming events in accounting classes to spread awareness.

Edit: Just adding 1 small thing. If your are at a small school and looking to grow the club, id recommend building relationships with the accounting professors.All of them are huge supporters of our org on campus and attract lots of students through constantly announcing/supporting us in their classes."
