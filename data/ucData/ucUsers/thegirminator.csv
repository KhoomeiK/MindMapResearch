macbookpro,fpi6reb,t3_gdm0o1,1588634785.0,"i'd say if you use final cut pro x, go with either the 2020 MBA i5 model with 256gb ram (use an external ssd if you need more space for cheap) or the 2019 MBP i5 (refurbished costs only $1,099 with student discount) - i think 8gb of ram should be fine for your use case"

In the next week or so, this show is going to be getting SOO many great reviews, netflix won't have a choice but to go ahead and plan for season 2, as long as they don't pull another ""Daredevil"" on us.... dammit i was really hyped for a new daredevil season but they bailed out last minute smh :("

relationship_advice,fmo7155,t3_fwa6bq,1586247753.0,"the brother probably didn't mean for all this to happen, he probably thought your son was going to be really excited! honestly this is a little crazy, your child is not really at wrong here, but lessons of respect need to be learned. If I'm correct, your son is probably almost 10 right? and i'm speaking as an 18 yr old who doesn't have the best relationship with his uncle. you need to tell your brother to apologize nicely in a caring way to your son. Then, if your son still doesn't want to go, wait a few days before the wedding in case there is a change of heart. If not, you should force your son to go. Look, I don't want to be the parent in this case since you are, but i'm just giving my two cents. There is absolutely no way your son should miss the wedding bc of something like this...."
