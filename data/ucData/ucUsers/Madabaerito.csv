nextfuckinglevel,fpmodqb,t1_fpme4l4,1588737615.0,well now a days we are sold the idea that college is the ONLY opportunity for success. so when your only opportunity for success also comes with a ton of life time debt itâ€™s kind of a back handed opportunity.
berkeley,fp2rmsg,t1_fp2rlce,1588266738.0,me too.
berkeley,fnn5klf,t1_fnn599s,1587084892.0,"yeah, for me, it could just be a case of grass is greener on the other side."
berkeley,fnn4ylr,t1_fnn411t,1587084512.0,"a tangible reason is Berkeley only has one dedicated pre med advisor, just one. so the best place to look for advice would be upperclassmen. 

there is also no dedicated premed major. technically anyone can be premed. at berkeley premed is just fulfilling to requirements needed to apply to medical school. 

lastly, im just assuming here, but considering UCLA has their own medical school i would believe theyâ€™d allocate more resources ro their premed students. 

TLDR: premed students are at afterthought at berkeley"
berkeley,fnmyt7j,t3_g2obc4,1587080842.0,"from my experience so far

berkeley doesnt care for or prioritize their premed students. i would say consider UCLA over CAL."
berkeley,fnmm0j2,t1_fnmlr9q,1587073863.0,"okay wait, so was that just satire?"
berkeley,fnml55x,t1_fnmitgf,1587073408.0,woah. itâ€™s just ironic satire. ya nimrod.
berkeley,fnicjxd,t3_g1vy0g,1586977702.0,itâ€™s crazy how the entire exam was immediately uploaded to chegg as soon as it was sent out. im sure people copied the answers directly too.
berkeley,fnbslg3,t3_g0sux4,1586821498.0,Reshall sucks. They make everything really hard. So only sign if you are sure youâ€™re going to take and keep the housing. Otherwise sort out your other options first.
berkeley,fn4cfvn,t3_fz30lh,1586638516.0,really doe? ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ¤š
IllegallySmolDogs,fmrd6xy,t3_fww8cy,1586319860.0,sheâ€™s a maltipoo
