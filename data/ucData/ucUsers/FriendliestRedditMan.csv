My friend is currently sick with COVID, and has told me that now he understands why it’s such a big threat. 

The symptoms are terrible: the grogginess caused by the fevers, the terrible coughs filled with phlegm, the tight breathing, the lack of taste, and the terrible diarrhea. Just by shutting down economic services doesn’t mean that an economic shutdown is going to ensue. 

I understand these are tough times for all; people have lost jobs, and economic security is low for those people. However, if the sentiment towards this virus continues to be underestimated, it will be that not only will a majority of the elderly die but a good portion of young and considerably healthy people will also die because nobody has immunity. 

You should be blessed that your experience with COVID was a mere “flu” to you, because my friend is suffering from it. Say what you will in regards to it being a hoax, or it being a ploy to whatever agenda, but the shutdowns are present for a reason and it’s to protect us from the disease. It may not be the best plan, but it’s all we got considering that Trump also did not consider COVID seriously and delayed America’s response time to it."
