AskMen,fpa8nky,t1_fpa7aat,1588443047.0,"I agree personality is important, but looks get your foot in the door. I actually am happy with my personality and how I carry myself and I think girls would like it, I just don’t get opportunities to show who I am."
AskMen,fpa4eaa,t1_fpa32i4,1588440581.0,"I’ve given up on searching for it, and as a quiet introvert who has already graduated college, that means I might never find it. I’m an average looking guy, so I haven’t had success with dating apps or anything.

I wouldn’t say I’m happy with my acceptance of this, but I’m not excited for my future."
Chargers,fozngrb,t1_foz9sir,1588193600.0,Maybe he actually doesn’t bench that much for his size and didn’t wanna tell you that he benches 145
Chargers,fonrp78,t3_g8ewp5,1587925153.0,Never knew Jonah Hill was a bolts fan. Good shit
Chargers,fodzbt5,t1_fodyvns,1587692987.0,That’s true. I just really am not happy with a situation where we start Tyrod for anything close to a full season. Roster is too talented to have a known floor.
Chargers,fody5mr,t1_fodw96r,1587692353.0,Doesn’t that make a win now mentality more enticing? Srs question not trolling
jobs,fo15068,t3_g4xflr,1587425870.0,"Depend how hard you want to look. I had a job when looking for a new one, so my method was usually to apply to 3-4 jobs a night before bed. I wouldn’t say I tried very hard to tailor my resume to each job, but I would sometimes change a line or two in my resumes/cover letters for each job.

I used indeed and LinkedIn primarily to find jobs, but anytime I applied, I would apply through the company website.

Realistically I would get 1 phone screening for every 10 applications. Whether that’s good or not I really couldn’t tell you. For the phone screens all you really need to do is be able to tell them about yourself. Write down an “about me” spiel and memorize it or just use the script while you’re on the phone. I did it for most of my phone screenings. You’ll have to give the same spiel in a video/in person interview and obviously you won’t be able to use a script then, but after all the phone screenings you should have said it enough to have memorized it.

I’ve rambled on long enough but I’d be happy to keep going if you have further questions."
nfl,fnpoi8g,t1_fnpmj0v,1587149117.0,The only commentator I ever complain about is Tessitore. He calls every single play like it’s game winning Hail Mary.
FortNiteBR,fnd0u3n,t1_fncmt3e,1586854286.0,"But what can be done about that? Serious question because I’m trying to figure out an answer myself. They can scale down SBBM, sure, but there are a lot of people that are just good at this game now. The old fortnite clips were only possible because there were players worse than actual bots. If those same players continued playing til now then at the very least they’re decent. We just need to accept that fortnite is not a new game any more and people are just getting better and better. It’s like how technology is always getting more advanced and how athletes are becoming bigger, faster, stronger. It’s just how things work in general."
UCSantaBarbara,fn3vven,t1_fn36sws,1586628932.0,Why would they stop cheating once they get to 109b?
AskReddit,fn2f3oq,t1_fn2cpez,1586586801.0,It doesn’t even need to get you laid for it to be good value. I would pay $10 a month for the confidence boost of getting a couple matches a month to be completely honest.
fightporn,fn16m11,t1_fmzywog,1586555821.0,Lmao to be fair it looked like bro did that on accident. Tried to swerve out the way but ended up swiping the calf.
dataisbeautiful,fn02oip,t1_fmz0kej,1586534345.0,"Is availability the main reason people are getting laid off though? You mention the tech industry and the ability to work from home, but you’d think the lack of business would still kill them too"
