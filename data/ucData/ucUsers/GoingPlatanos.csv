Give the law schools you're planning to attend, and I assume they are T14 or strong regionals, a call; Stanford is really good about answering questions."
UCSD,fom7h49,t1_fodjjjz,1587880561.0,">Try to volunteer for a lab, there are labs that would love to take on a volunteer, as long as you plan to stay through the summer. Cold email labs at UCSD, Salk, TSRI, LJI.  
>  
>There’s 2 sides to it, in vitro (benchwork) and in vivo (animal work). It’s usually complete luck what your lab will train you on. But let me tell you, knowing animal work skills will help you a lot. I slaved doing animal work for 5 years during undergrad and after. I hated it, but I became good at it, and people treated me like a wizard.  I was the go to guy who trained grad students, post docs, and even helped refresh project scientists. Years later I earned my stripes, became lab manager and I’m headed into bioinformatics.

>In the next couple years, there will be a lot of vaccines and drugs in development by non profit academic organizations and biotech companies. They only need so many people working with cells in vitro, but the will need a shit ton of people doing the animal work for preclinical studies. I’ve gotten $30+/hr offers from big pharma before and after coronavirus, but I like where I’m at.

>However, get yourself some in vivo lab experience volunteering for 6-12 months, and you will be set for a job.

Can't believe Zezima comes to my school."
