climbing,fpn1h0y,t1_fpldntz,1588747387.0,"7mm is recommended for nylon, which is what most accessory cord is made of. Mammut for example has 13kN strength for 7mm but 7.5kN for 6mm. Knots and time will weaken that breaking strength, so that's cutting it a little too low for my preference. For other materials, check the rating and use your own judgment.

If you're permanently leaving it in a loop, then double fisherman's is fine. It's a pain to untie though if you want an open loop. One solution people use is to tie figure eights on a bight at each end of the cord. To form the loop, you can just clip the two ends together. This allows you to loop around trees, boulders, or use the full length if you want. I just leave my cord open though and tie an overhand bend if I need a loop."
climbing,fpn0ak3,t1_fpmwdn3,1588746455.0,"Something around 15mm is much more important than 10mm. The smallest edges on the Beastmaker boards are 15mm for reference. I would start with 12/13mm if they want another edge smaller than 15mm. 

20mm to 10mm is a huge difference. If you're strong enough to train with a 10mm edge, you are probably better off training one arm hangs on the 20mm. 

The edges I like are 30mm (warmup) with 20mm and 15mm training edges."
climbing,fpmtwzn,t1_fpmproq,1588741625.0,"Really depends on your friend's preferences. I would ask your friend what they want. I don't value pockets that much. But if they climb in an area with lots of pockets, then pockets would be nice. A decent selection of edges sizes is most important for a lot of people. A warmup edge and two training edges is what I use 95% of the time. I like 20mm and 15mm.

If you do have pockets, I would stagger them so that all the holds are comfortable shoulder width apart. Different angles is a nice feature if you can add it. Overall, just make sure it's comfortable for the main training holds your friend wants."

climbing,fpi2zdi,t1_fphzl21,1588632645.0,"I've never had to retire a rope because of core strength. Most people cut or retire their ropes due to sheath damage. I've never taken a fall greater than factor 1 so the core durability (which correlates to the UIAA fall rating) is not a concern. If I was worried about durability, I would look at sheath percentage and rope diameter in addition to other's opinions."

tradclimbing,fphdrqh,t1_fph9o27,1588619476.0,">That's quite an involved anchor. The most popular version is where the rope just runs through pieces and get cloved into lockers attached on the belay loop. One big upside to this is that you can readjust rope length when the pieces themselves are out of reach.

Aside from the optional redirection point, you only tie one extra knot (the butterfly). If you didn't have the butterfly, wouldn't it be the same number of knots? The butterfly itself is mainly to make escaping the belay easier, so I guess that's optional too. You could put the clove hitches on the butterfly itself if you're far from the anchor."

For longer lengths, you can carry 120cm slings or a rabbit runner if needed, or you can just use two 60cm slings."

climbing,foq1qsn,t3_g8ma6z,1587979809.0,"Someone mentioned cutting the rope ends if they are damaged. Another benefit is if your neighbor doesn't know the rope age, you can usually find out by looking at the core of the rope. Manufacturers put a colored thread and identification thread inside the core that can tell what year it was made.

Dogbones aren't usually that much of a concern. They're rated so high to begin with that even new ropes will break before old dogbones. Same with carabiners. But always use your own judgment."
climbing,foorsjy,t1_foooatg,1587945097.0,"It depends on what you're making the top rope anchor from. If it's bolts, that length of rope is probably good if you need to extend the anchor over an edge. Natural anchors, you probably want more rope if trees/boulders/cracks are far away from the ledge. Depends on your crag situation.

Buying from Amazon is a bit suspect though. GM Climbing in particular is some Chinese company that has claimed UIAA certification when it didn't have it, although they seem to actually have it now. I would just buy a long spool of 7mm or 8mm cord from a reputable source. You can always cut it to whatever length you need, and you can always find a use for excess cord or give it to a friend."

SpiceandWolf,fojk8ew,t3_g7rd1a,1587823094.0,"The short answer is that Medio knows about Holo from Yarei, and they can use that against Milone. 

The longer answer is that Medio has not collected enough silver to get a deal with the king. If Medio had enough silver, they could just get the deal and turn in Holo. Since they didn't do that, Lawrence speculates they are trying to slow down Milone. 

Medio fears that Milone already has enough silver to get a deal with the king. Medio doesn't necessarily want to turn Holo in immediately because if Milone has a deal with the king, the king would be mad at Medio. Instead, they can just use Holo as a threat to stall Milone. If Milone just completes the deal, they know Medio would turn in Holo, so they have to devote effort into saving her."

The carport seems like a good place to hang a board from. If the edge size works out for you, then sure you could hang from it. Though personally I would hope your carport would be thick enough that it's too easy of an edge to hang from. Also it's probably too sharp so you would have to round it. Then again, if you're going through that work, why not make a board anyway and get better edge sizes?"

Depends on what you mean by beginner. This is not a book for beginner climbers, but beginner climber shouldn't be soloing anyway. Lead rope soloing is a giant hassle and most people would find it too much effort, but if you are considering it check out that book.

Top rope soloing you just need to pay more attention about rope path and abrasion. Dave Macleod's video on rope soloing talks about that. Everything else you should know from general climbing before thinking about top rope soloing. Petzl gives some suggestions about using their devices for that."
climbing,fmy20ws,t1_fmxmf19,1586476448.0,"The quad anchor uses 4 strands of cord though so 7 mm cord becomes around 40 kN. However, the limiter knots also weaken the cord so you probably end up a little less than 30 kN.

The strength of your material is pretty irrelevant once you start getting over 15 kN anyway and just distracts from factors that actually matters. Quickdraws work fine though."

tradclimbing,fmhxp97,t3_fvdz1n,1586096999.0,"It's just a waste to use it for top roping. When you're top roping, you don't care as much about weight and a thicker rope will last longer for that purpose. Obviously if it can hold lead falls, you could top rope with it. People abuse their ropes more when top roping or ""workout climbing"" so Edelrid probably just says that to deter people from doing that. I don't have the Canary specifically, but I have a light rope I use for alpine climbs. People also use light ropes for sending their projects. Some people also like triple rated ropes when climbing in a group of three."
