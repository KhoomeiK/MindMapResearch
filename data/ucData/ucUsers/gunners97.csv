UCI,fpjcksg,t3_gdr4xl,1588663640.0,Why have I never heard of this archive ?!?!
UCI,fpifzfq,t1_fpib8qz,1588640121.0,Maybe half of it but I doubt it. At least half of the $37 million is required to go back to students so what your saying can’t be true.
UCI,fpby7sh,t1_fpbxq1u,1588481892.0,"Yo I hope you don’t have to take MAE 112 in fall because the 130A prof from last quarter is teaching it. I think I might have to take it unfortunately

As for 106, I guess let’s just see how our midterm goes... I wish we could’ve just made the robot and been graded on that"
UCI,fpbxw25,t1_fpbxmp0,1588481634.0,"Lol I was legit just about to post another comment here asking if anyone knows if the 106 survey is confidential. Bc if it’s not, then we can’t express how we really feel.

And yeah I spent so much time on that last 130B hw even though I had the right answers, but Wiley was marking is wrong. Smh

Edit: Just saw your username, it checks out lmfao"
UCI,fpaf5pi,t1_fpae30e,1588446889.0,"Ya, well it hasn’t been too bad considering we’ve had ZERO homework on his lecture material. But that’s gonna show when we all fail this midterm coming up. And it’s not like I’m not trying in the class, I’ve been to every lecture and I try taking notes but there’s just way too much material and he goes so fast that I get lost right away. And he makes it seem like most of the stuff in lecture is review, when in fact I have never seen it before."
UCI,fpadzqs,t3_gbnfgu,1588446194.0,"Yoooooo I’m in both of these. They’re pretty wack. All those people who volunteer to be on cam in 106 are the tiny minority who actually knows a bit about the class and they make it seem to the prof like everyone else understands the material. But I haven’t learned anything in 106 and we’re about to start week 6.

I realized 130B was a joke when the prof didn’t even email us about quiz 1 until 2 hours before it, with no prior mentions about it. And he posted over 20 pages worth of notes for the 2 lectures this week, like fuck off. I kinda wanna ask him if he be willing to just have an actual zoom meeting for lecture instead of posting the fucking videos so we can talk to him live and ask questions. It’s my only class that doesn’t have a live zoom meeting. And wtf is the point of these CQCs if no one fucking answers our questions?? Also the homework on Wiley this week..."
UCI,fp0iljq,t1_fotf987,1588210000.0,"[Here you go.](https://www.newsday.com/news/health/coronavirus/death-certificate-covid-1.44229887)  “I guarantee you,"" he continued. ""There is significant undercount of COVID mortality, according to your numbers.""

Straight from the UCI in the News email."
UCI,fozkq8i,t1_fozkgov,1588192289.0,So they specifically said we can’t cancel for the upcoming year? Even of there’s no in person classes?
UCI,fot8h66,t1_fot6zym,1588047088.0,"Praying for you! I was looking at a heat map of cases per 100k people and Georgia has some of the highest numbers, along with the likes of NY, Louisiana, and the Navajo and Apache Tribes, which I feel especially bad for since they aren’t getting any help. I hope you’re not in Randolph County which has 2240 cases per 100k people...

And I still can’t believe [this shit](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/490758-georgia-governor-says-he-didnt-know-asymptomatic-people-could-spread%3famp) . How did it take until April for your governor to find out you don’t have to feel sick to spread it?? Seems like he was also involved in some shady stuff to get elected tho so I guess it makes sense."
UCI,fosfz2t,t1_forrnyk,1588029959.0,"Don’t look at the news! I’ve been doing the same thing until recently, but since I’ve stopped I feel much better and have more free time to focus on things to better myself. Also fuck the mainstream media and their political biases, just watch your local news if you really can’t go without news."
UCI,fosfib5,t3_g97nhk,1588029698.0,All I have to say is thank fuck we’re not in Georgia.
UCI,fosf59n,t1_foscf5r,1588029497.0,"I’m not even smart, but I’ve come to realize that I’m definitely smarter than about 30% of the population who are in mental hibernation, constantly."
UCI,fopn80x,t1_fonohty,1587966112.0,There’s plenty of leases that are June-June and I’m positive those people would like to know before their lease starts.
UCI,fopmtai,t1_foo4l4c,1587965779.0,"Fauci said that he expects it to come back, but we’ll be better prepared to handle it, in both preventing and tracking down spread. As much as I’d like to go back, having people in lecture halls of 200+ is definitely not going to be ideal, in my opinion."
UCI,fopm3s4,t1_fopgzol,1587965198.0,Me too!
UCI,fnqf2g2,t1_fnqbqzx,1587163346.0,"This goes back to the question of what is happening with the other half of the $37 million that isn’t required to go to financial aid for students. And if they can’t do their work at all due to the virus, maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea to temporarily lay them off so that way they can file for unemployment and get $600 a week from the government, instead of from students pockets. Not saying I don’t agree with you, just giving some other options. I also don’t mean to discriminate blue collar workers, but those are the jobs that literally can not work right now, as opposed to office workers who can still work from home. 

I’m no expert and Idk much, but this situation is clapped."
UCI,fnqd8hv,t1_fnq3igu,1587162324.0,"What’s up with that adobe license. It said we could get it for free until May 31, but when I followed their instructions, it only gave me a 7 day trial."
UCI,fnqczkm,t1_fnpdobo,1587162196.0,"It’d be smarter for their employers to just furlough them for the time being. That way they can file for unemployment and get $600 a week from the government, instead of taking it from all the students, and giving it to a select few for doing nothing in this time."
UCI,fnpfe81,t3_g2vhsj,1587144542.0,I just want my $800+ that goes to on campus resources each quarter like the ARC back. That’s some bs since literally no one can use those resources right now
UCI,fnpf37r,t1_fnnwf7h,1587144391.0,"At least half of it is mandated to go to students in need of financial aid. As for the other half, I don’t know. We also were one of the schools with the most money given to us in the nation."
UCI,fnlqrth,t3_g2ivz8,1587058113.0,"I don’t necessarily think this one is a bribe. The people running for the 3 most important positions on the FTC slate are all in Greek Life. So, they actually want to disproportionately allocate all this money to the small percentage of students in Greek Life. 

Also, makes sense that they don’t support the Womxn’s Hub considering the fraternity (Kappa Sigma) that the person running for president and VP are in has sexual assault allegations against them each year."
UCI,fnlpcv5,t3_g2iuhz,1587057429.0,"I’m with you, but there needs to be another platform to tell people about this. The percentage of people that actually look at this sub compared to the student population is pretty small. And those who do come here, already have either voted, or decided they don’t care because they’ve seen all the posts about it up to this point.

Edit: Suggestion: everyone just drop the election link in their zoom chats for class today and tmrw and remind peers to vote."
