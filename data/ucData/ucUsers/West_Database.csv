Now, take around 30k 18-21 year olds and force them to live in a 3x4 block region and get back to me on whether or not youâ€™re likely to see any parties.

Go to any big campus on a Friday night and drive around and youâ€™ll see way bigger parties than what SB puts on.

The â€˜reputationâ€™ comes from our parentsâ€™ generation when this school used to let in anyone who applied.

And just remember, the DP, stands for Del Playa"

UCSantaBarbara,fnsxpi1,t3_g3auew,1587230783.0,"A.S. Elections? You mean the ones where only 15% of the student population votes and the school sees fit to give a collective of 200 Poli Sci majors $15 million to spend on pizza parties and coloring socials?

Boy oh boy, itâ€™s that time of the year again fellas!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnsvd5o,t3_g3l6uv,1587229513.0,"Greek Life here has a very bad reputation, and is massively hated by the 90% of the school not in GL. Just this last year there were ~3 big sexual assault scandals in GL which were covered by the school newspapers.

But I mean, if hanging out with your BROS shotgunninâ€™ beer on a Tuesday night and playinâ€™ sum DIE on the front lawn with trash littered about, or dancing to some HARD EDM and getting trashed on a Sunday morning is your cup of tea... do it?"
UCSantaBarbara,fnsujx4,t1_fnrnxuc,1587229067.0,"Yes itâ€™s extremely rigorous in a way you havenâ€™t experienced in high school (all STEM degrees are here, but ESPECIALLY Physics, there is a 6-course weeder lower div series Physics 20-25 which will test whether or not you can hang). Unless you adjust to regularly reading your textbooks, going to office hours the second theyâ€™re needed, and thoroughly understanding presented material, you will not make it through. I have several friends who switched out of Physics because they couldnâ€™t commit to what was required of them. All that said though, if youâ€™re smart and know how to study, youâ€™ll be just fine."
