berkeley,fpiy60j,t3_gdn1k6,1588651545.0,"Caveat: I don't have any firsthand experience with your situation. All I know is based upon conversations with my physics friends and a few talks I attended specifically aimed at ""how to get a job with a physics BA"" (I was a physics major for a while before I was math).

From what I remember, a physics BA gives you options, but they tend to be fairly non-linear. Which is to say, you will (almost?) never find job listings looking for ""physics knowledge"". You'll have to scout around for interesting jobs, and then be prepared to make your case to them as to why you would be able to do the job. 

Yes, the lack of internships is probably hurting you. And if you don't know how to code, you'll almost certainly need to learn how. (Frankly, Berkeley should require all STEM students to learn coding; it's kind of shocking they don't. Whether you're aiming at research or an industry job, effectively everyone needs programming skills now)

I'd also look for subreddits / other resources dedicated to job seeking. The Berkeley subreddit is mostly filled with people who haven't tried entering the job market yet, so their advice (yeah, including myself) probably won't be great."
berkeley,fpiv6al,t1_fpiudmq,1588649463.0,"So here's the underlying logic. Suppose I see a full suite of PNP. It could be that they bombed everything, or it could be that they did alright and were just prioritizing other things in their life. I can't really read that much into it beyond that.

If I see mixed PNP and graded, then I know the person took the graded option for any class they did well in. Which, equivalently, means that anything they took PNP in is a class they did poorly in. It removes the ambiguity (or at least that's how it reads). So a mixed PNP reads like this: anything graded is something they felt they did well in (and, unfortunately, there was a decent chance it was very leniently curved or they may have even cheated). And anything I see as a Pass is assumed to be a C or worse."
berkeley,fpiipyx,t3_gdip7k,1588641735.0,"I just finished my grad application process, and I'll be starting next Fall. Here's my input: 

First, I'd be wary of a mix of PNP and graded. That tells me ""whatever class was PNP'd, this person was doing poorly in; otherwise, they would have taken it for a grade, as they did with other classes"". It likely matters less if the graded stuff is major-relevant and the PNP is gen ed, though (barring one of the insane majors like pre-med, where your performance in interpretive dance can keep you out of med school).

That said, I'd still be somewhat wary of taking grades this semester without very good reason. Admission committees know this semester was very unusual, and posed a lot of challenges to students. They also know that cheating was unbelievably common. Being honest, if I was on an ad com, I would actually be sort of hesitant about students with a bunch of high grades this semester. The odds that those grades were the result of cheating are quite high, and it shows some very odd priorities.

Also, in response to another comment: your personal statements when applying are quite short (think about a page) and need to be very carefully written. You have to be very, very surgical about what you include and how you say it. You're not going to want to spend a paragraph explaining ""Well I PNP'd these classes during the pandemic because X and took these classes as graded because Y"". It's a lot of real estate for a very minor point, and honestly comes across as sort of... immature?

So, my general advice would be to take the full PNP unless all of your major-specific courses are likely to result in A's."

There's a game I used to play in my head about people like this, ""Stupid or evil"". The virus situation has made the game a lot less fun, as I've come to realize the answer is generally the latter. Republicans told the US the virus would be no big deal and fought against safeguards, all the while selling off stock. They knew what would happen, they just didn't care."

berkeley,fp3pe8p,t3_gb2dt7,1588283400.0,"Honestly I faced a very similar choice recently with respect to my grad school choice. I was deciding between a very prestigious school, and a school I felt would be a better fit for me as a person. I ended up going with the better fit. Four years is a long time to spend in a place that's not a great match for you. And keep in mind, if you're feeling happier overall, you're likely to do better in your academics. I also think the gulf between the long term prospects out of Cal vs UCLA probably aren't that far apart. Higher Cal salaries might be explainable by a lot of Cal grads finding jobs in the Bay Area, which have to pay more since the CoL is astronomically high."
berkeley,fp3f3ry,t1_fp3dp8k,1588278206.0,"Counterpoint: part of the speculation I’ve heard is that they won’t bump up the GPA cutoff, but just depress the curves of those classes. And for OP, the reason for it is that there was recently a lawsuit over 8 hour UGSI’s working in CS; long story short, the number of TA’s available in CS moving forward is likely to be noticeably lower. The speculation is that they’ll find ways to cull the CS majors even more to keep class sizes manageable. 

Which isn’t to say that it’s impossible to declare by any means! But if your target is CS, it’s probably a good idea to do a bit of preparation over the summer (or whenever) for the weeder courses, and make sure to put a lot of effort into them/ develop very solid study habits for them. Once you declare, you’ll be good to go."
berkeley,fp39pp2,t3_gaw3la,1588275537.0,"Generally speaking it's pretty easy. I came as a physics transfer student, ended up swapping to math; all I had to do was complete the course requirements to declare math and I was good to go. There's a notable exception if you're trying to enter the CS major, however. Then you'll need to complete a series of 3 weeder courses with a GPA in those 3 courses of at least 3.3. (There's also some speculation that this 3.3 requirement may be inflated in the near term)"

berkeley,for6vp0,t1_foq65rt,1588007185.0,"Of course. Let me know if you have any follow up questions. 

In comparing US vs EU undergrad in math, there’s another thing I forgot to mention. US schools, Berkeley included, tend to do a lot of general education. Depending on your background, you may spend much of the first 2 or so years here completing courses like American Institutions, biology, basic Physics, etc (you get a lot of leeway in specific choices. See: https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/degree-requirements ). But overall, if you haven’t already satisfied these requirements with other work, you’ll have to take about 8-10 classes of non-math as part of your degree. As far as I know, most European schools don’t bother with general education.

Now this has pros and cons.

Pros: gives you more opportunity to explore your interests. You might decide, after some experiences that you like physics better than math, or biology, or history, etc. Will give you a somewhat broader knowledge base moving forward, and you’ll be a significantly better writer (which matters more than you may think). Can help you manage workloads, by spreading out general education courses with hard math classes. You will have an easier time meeting a variety of people outside of your own major. 

Cons: Any gen ed class you take is another math class you might not have time to take. The rule of thumb I’ve used for a while is that a US master’s degree in math is roughly equivalent to a European bachelor’s degree, in terms of math content. This varies a bit, and I’ve seen a few Cal students take an absolutely astonishing number of math  classes (and grad classes). But this has always been due to A.) skipping as much gen ed as possible with AP classes/ other college credit and B.) taking extremely heavy course loads. It’s also definitely not the norm. I never looked that heavily into European grad schools, but I’ve heard that they often view US students as having a surprisingly small amount of math under their belt. How this would affect your prospects though I can’t say."
berkeley,fop221d,t3_g8ppur,1587951361.0,"I'm finishing a pure math degree this semester, and I'm heading to grad school in the Fall. I'll answer as best I can.

1. I don't have any other direct comparisons; I've only experienced Cal's program. That said, I think it's pretty damn good. The core curricula for the pure / applied math programs are well chosen; I was recently sort of shocked to realize that there are US programs where you can get a math degree having never taken real analysis or abstract algebra. You still need to do a bit of scouting ahead to take classes with professors who will fit you well, but I've been quite pleased.

2. Pretty highly. But keep in mind, grad school admission will depend hugely on you, what you do, and what your letter writers have to say about you; better phrased would be that Berkeley doesn't really limit your options much and gives you a little boost, but the name alone won't carry you.

3. See https://career.berkeley.edu/Survey/2018Majors . But again, your grad choices will depend hugely on you. And being blunt, being an international student makes getting into US grad schools massively harder. I got into nearly all of the schools I applied to, including Berkeley itself; if I were international, however, it would have been very different. International students are very expensive for US schools, so they are judged on much harsher standards.

4. Depends on what the masters is in, and where ""somewhere else"" is. Berkeley doesn't do masters in Math; you can only get it by enrolling in the PhD program and deciding to leave early.

5. Berkeley is competitive but not cut-throat; that is, it's (relatively) hard to get high grades, but the students aren't mean to one another, and they don't sabotage each other. CS weeder classes are probably more competitive, dunno about premed. And how much stress you experience and whether it's worth it depends on you and your other choices. I personally think Berkeley's math department was very good for me.

6. It varies. Math people tend to be a bit weird in my view (myself included), but I like it. There are a few ""I'm so much smarter than everyone"" people, but not that many (tbh I saw more of this in the physics department). Maybe less social, but you can certainly meet people if you care to.

7. Super subjective. My view: Positive would be the people. Berkeley people are super interesting, and most of my professors were awesome (granted, I made sure to do proper scouting). Negative: Berkeley in general is extremely self-motivated. Tons of opportunities exist, but almost nothing will happen automatically; you have to pursue things on your own time if you want more than classes and tests, and often with very little guidance. But again, upside is the incredible wealth of stuff that's out there if you pursue it.

8. Probably depends on what you mean by ""research groups""."
