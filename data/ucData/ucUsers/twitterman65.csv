Also, who was the only candidate to bring up new ideas? Orion. Who else talked about the bus and so many cost-cutting innovation, I really can't think of a single candidate"

I've read all the Daily Bruin posts for the USAC candidates and it's clear that there's a lot of bias towards For the People. We need to all work together to make sure that CCI and independent candidates win. ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW – VOTE FOR ANY CANDIDATES EXCEPT FTP!

Short story – vote for CCI or people running as ""independent, not the FTP group that's making our fees higher during a pandemic! I really don't have the extra $15 to pay for it, especially rn. Orion is obviously the best tho."
ucla,fphv0md,t3_gdj169,1588628310.0,DB is soooo rigged for For the People. They endorsed all the FTP candidates except 1 smh
ucla,fphutar,t3_gdin17,1588628203.0,"Orion orion orion -- we need this man as our usac prez! Draco is great too, Brandon, Atharva, Deven, Sam (anyone who is not For the People!!)"
