UCI,fnbxtxp,t3_g0uo1g,1586824477.0,"Fund the Clubs agree that ASUCI has been ineffective for years. This is why they will serve students by funding their clubs. They promise to secure $750,000 for clubs, which is 5X more than the $150,000 currently available.

The ASUCI constitution will mandate 1/3 of ASUCI's 2.25 million dollar budget will go to clubs each year. Anteaters United and Ignite Change are against it because they wanted to use this $750,000 to pay interns and ASUCI students more. Currently, ASUCI pays itself over $220,000.

The Womxn Hub referendum will require all students to pay $6 a year to the Womxn Hub, which is used by less than 4,000 students. UCI Currently charges over $2,100 dollars per year in Fees. This referendum will raise the cost of college. ASUCI should be focused on getting $6 from the $2,100 for the Womxn Hub, and not raising tuition on students who can not afford college as is."

UCI,fnbwcam,t3_g0uzp2,1586823619.0,"Fund the Clubs will give $750,000 to clubs at UCI which is 5X more than the current funds. Anteaters United and Re-Ignite Change are the Carole Baskin's of UCI and want to maintain the Status-Quo.

The New ASUCI Constitution will secure $750,000 each year for Registered Campus Organizations on campus. Anteaters United and Re-Ignite Change wanted to use these funds to pay ASUCI interns and themselves more money. 

Vote Yes on the ASUCI Constitution and vote for Fund the Clubs candidates! Do not Let the Carole Baskin's of UCI win!
