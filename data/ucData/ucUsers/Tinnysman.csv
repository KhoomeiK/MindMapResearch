TeamSolomid,foojcpf,t1_foohi72,1587940114.0,"""im rude"" lmao"
TeamSolomid,fooeaib,t1_foodtno,1587937422.0,you're a dickhead
TeamSolomid,fokztfj,t1_fokzafi,1587852097.0,Uhhhh I cannot confirm or deny that
TeamSolomid,fokz8k2,t1_fokyzea,1587851775.0,This is the dream babyyyyyyy
TeamSolomid,fo7uge0,t3_g67u7r,1587584743.0,"Fuck no. This isn't a fairly land where we can just buy out everyone's contracts. Also, I wouldn't mind seeing Svenskeren back, but Hauntzer is definitely not a top, top laner."
TeamSolomid,fn8c8c8,t3_g03fb7,1586738430.0,All eggs in the Kobbe basket let's see if he can save the season
TeamSolomid,fn8bdkl,t3_g03fb7,1586737902.0,This series on Peter Zhang horrible drafts
TeamSolomid,fn86coy,t3_g03fb7,1586734855.0,Dardoch smurfing this game who would have thought he would play well on champion he is ACTUALLY good at
TeamSolomid,fn869kv,t1_fn84wa4,1586734801.0,Yeah when get gets level 11 his ult is rank 2 and has a super low cd. How stupid are you. I love people that think they are smart but in reality they have an IQ of 75.
TeamSolomid,fn84r1j,t1_fn84lo8,1586733874.0,Kassadin is busted when he hits 11. You're the low silver player.
TeamSolomid,fn84pc2,t3_g03fb7,1586733845.0,I love people keep shitting on the players when we have an academy coach doing draft for us. Wtf is irelia supposed to do against their comp with a lead? She gets destroyed by Azir.
TeamSolomid,fn7rctp,t1_fn7pjh2,1586726079.0,One of the biggest BB haters on this reddit
TeamSolomid,fmuikg6,t3_fxdpkj,1586392108.0,brokenblade might be the worst gp ive ever seen
TeamSolomid,fmufmhn,t3_fxdpkj,1586390457.0,Sett beats GP really worrying game this game will be about how well Brokenblade does (basically how most of our games go).
TeamSolomid,fmudc60,t3_fxdpkj,1586389172.0,This team is so inconsistent that we get to see 2-0 week TSM and 0-2 week TSM all in the same  series!
TeamSolomid,fmu75e9,t3_fxdpkj,1586385825.0,Can't even blame coaching staff or draft for this game this team just looks clueless its like they  all speak different languages even though they have 5 English speakers.
TeamSolomid,fmu71dh,t3_fxdpkj,1586385768.0,"People that blame draft have no clue how this game works. TSM had such an insane lead because of draft, but as we have seen so many times this split this team can not close out games. This isnt the TSM of 2016 or 2017 when we get a lead the game is never guarenteed."
TeamSolomid,fmu6ufd,t3_fxdpkj,1586385668.0,Team has absolutetly no identity we won draft hard and got an early lead all we had to do was snowball and get dragon soul or baron and we win. Instead we get caught out and we make the stupidest diving plays.
TeamSolomid,fmu6r0x,t3_fxdpkj,1586385618.0,this team is dumpster fire Cloud 9 made 100 thieves look like an academy team we make them look like 2018 100 Thieves
TeamSolomid,fmu5l8v,t3_fxdpkj,1586385005.0,This team has no clue how to play from ahead
TeamSolomid,fmu2bsm,t3_fxdpkj,1586383260.0,This is a really good draft for tsm and they finally banned ornn so braindead 100T cant just rely on stat checking us in teamfights
TeamSolomid,fmu035p,t3_fxdpkj,1586382097.0,I love how this team does not ban ornn but then drafts a losing aatrox into Ornn. Ornn always beats aatrox and then proceeds to brainlessly gives his team 5k in stats.
TeamSolomid,fmtzbky,t3_fxdpkj,1586381699.0,it amazes that Broken blade can be so dominate in game 1 and so irrelevent in game 2
TeamSolomid,fmty4vc,t1_fmtxy97,1586381084.0,exactly
TeamSolomid,fmtxwl3,t3_fxdpkj,1586380965.0,This draft getting exposed for being shit we just got lucky in game 1
ucr,fmmi0i5,t3_fw5l4o,1586205624.0,"Mostly dependent on profressor to be honest. I would say Chem 1A is generally the easiest, but 1C and 1B are harder and depend on the quality of the profressor, and spoiler alert most chem profressors at this school are ass, but some are decent."
ucr,fm5ququ,t3_ft54yt,1585778143.0,"""you're a piece of trash that deserves to be put down."" Alright you went too far. If you actually get that triggered you have serious issues. I agree that the trolling in Zoom is annoying and that people are trying to learn but that doesn't mean you can say shit like that."
