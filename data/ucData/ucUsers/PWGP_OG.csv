CsectionCentral,fnmtsjl,t1_fnkxtz3,1587078020.0,This is exactly what happened to me!  Magnesium is no joke... did they put you on bedrest the entire time they were trying to induce?  I thought that was the worse(!!)

I went into the hospital for induction on a Thursday.... ended up delivering by csection on a Sunday... released Tuesday morning and was ever so happy to be the F outta there!  Of course my situation was a hell of a lot different....Never planned a csection and was tied to a bed for 96 hours  — catheter and all.  Why this awful scenario?   Magnesium IV.  A courtesy of preeclampsia that didn’t show its dirty little face until coming in for induction — which failed because apparently I have a cervix of steal.  So, after being poked and pried for 3 days while chained to a hospital bed, I was ready to csection and go.  Csection occurred on a Sunday... Bedrest ceased on a Monday (some policy about needing to be off of magnesium for 24 hours before being able to walk.  Guess feeling drunks a liability hmmm ). Immediately after they let me off bedrest, I was up and moving around — a lot.  Doctor knew I needed to get out of there for sanity lol.  Was discharged Tuesday morning.  It was great."

Neither one of us had a fever but GD we were sick!  now wondering if it was Covid19  (PS- we’re healthy individuals so kicked it with lots of sleep, fluids and DayQuil/NyQuil, etc... feel perfectly fine now!)"
