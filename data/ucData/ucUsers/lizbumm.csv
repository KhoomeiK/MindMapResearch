sleeptrain,fosoec4,t3_g99xf4,1588034731.0,We share the room with our 8 month old and just moved out while did our sleep training method. We moved back in and all is well!
breastfeeding,fnukg0b,t3_g3zt1s,1587264236.0,Definitely sunflower lecithin and there’s a product called “happy ducts” by wish garden that helps as well.
HelpMeFind,fntjrx8,t1_fnsyi0h,1587243064.0,Found!!
sleeptrain,fntjpxz,t1_fns04fb,1587243030.0,"Yes, sorry if it was confusing...my brain is not working!  I should also mention he is a thumb sucker so that helped. It sounds like you can get him to go to sleep at bedtime again since you already did it once. That was at least true for my dude.  Sending lots of love to you!"
sleeptrain,fnnmh7y,t3_g2rnjr,1587095889.0,"I think it’s normal because he figured out how to get you get him.  My guess would be if you let him CIO at the 2am or any other wake ups, he would sleep (based on your other nights). That  being said, I was never able to totally sleep train the wake ups after bedtime, I just always fed my son and then after a few months, worked those out.   

I’m on kid #2 now (7 months old) and currently sleep training him. I’m doing two dream feeds (mostly to keep my supply up) and that is going well. I figure I’ll get rid of one of those feeds in a few weeks.   If he wakes up in between the dream feeds, my husband checks in on him. He also has a pacifier. We spread a bunch around his crib so he can hopefully find them if he wakes up.  

Sleep training is so tough and you will get it all figured out. Having a screamer makes it extra hard.   Good luck!"
LosAngeles,fnm5qxw,t3_g2inio,1587065567.0,What the f with the dude immediately asking if he can have a grassy lawn?  Does anyone learn anything!!!!  Like do we think we will learn anything after this pandemic about keeping the cleanest air in the mf'in country?  That's pretty awesome and hoping we adopt some better regulations to help this planet.
AskLosAngeles,fn7zis9,t3_g02q5a,1586730790.0,"We had something very similar. I have a preschooler and we both had dry coughs, heavy chests and pink eye!  His turned into ear infections and mine turned into a sinus infection. We both weren’t clear after our course of 10 day antibiotics and we both suffered another round of whatever it all was. Neither of us ever had fevers."
realhousewives,fn51nhg,t1_fn4xy8h,1586653803.0,"Oh no, I like Teddi!  For it def sucks though :)."
AskLosAngeles,fn51hpe,t1_fn4pf3v,1586653699.0,"This is thought provoking and wonderful. I’ve definitely been absentminded before and felt so bad when I realized my mistake. On the flip side, it’s so hard some days to have patience for others.  Like now, I’m getting so pissed at the people who aren’t wearing masks and/or yielding way. I’m working on not yelling :)."

UCSC,fmr0ajz,t3_fwwefe,1586310942.0,Me too!  Thank you for posting this and for all the others who are posting photos. I graduated in the early 2000’s and miss it there!
interestingasfuck,fmr04mn,t1_fmqxxx1,1586310838.0,"Not sure why you got downvoted there. Totally see your side as well.  It’s such a grieving process for me. Same goes with architectural preservation for houses. I love the old, I want to see it and yet, society does need to amend and change.  Wish there was a way to have both!"

silverlake,fmdstld,t3_fufowo,1585976849.0,We’ve had to avoid all the stairs too because they just aren’t big enough!  Not sure about closing them though.
