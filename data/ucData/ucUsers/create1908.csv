CollegeVsCollege,fpi3w4r,t3_gdlj4s,1588633153.0,USC is deeply rooted in California all across the state especially SoCal
VoteBlue,fphqwe8,t1_fphcywd,1588626155.0,And that‚Äôs totally fine. I‚Äôm Californian and speaking on this end people need to understand that Democrats across the nation are not California Dems. All Dems vary and should fit accordingly to the voters of their state. The same with republicans. Republicans in California are probably considered liberal republicans because they are not Republicans from the south. The focus of a Dem. in a state that leans more Republican per say should know how to fit and represent his/her constituents accordingly. Example of Katie Porter who is a Dem representing the most affluent and one of the reddest district in Orange County. Constituents will and should always cross aisles when they see and feel the person running for office is the right fit.
UCI,fpb5tjd,t3_gc1w77,1588462726.0,Got mine today. Same I didn‚Äôt expect a little fatty check.
UCI,fp92xc7,t1_fp8ue29,1588412257.0,Seriously I checked and nothing. Hopefully later in the day

You are a godsend!"
VoteBlue,fooio01,t1_foobj1x,1587939719.0,One of those lean republican senate seats must fall in democrats hands. Especially Georgia.
VoteBlue,fokz23b,t1_fokxprw,1587851678.0,He wasn‚Äôt but he was literally campaigning for every single republican that was running. If I‚Äôm not mistaken Jon Tester opponent was endorsed by Trump. I want to believe everyone who voted republican had Trump in mind.

You might want to put your post here. You‚Äôll get more out of it."
VoteBlue,fokcbls,t1_fojvnlu,1587839412.0,"You‚Äôre partially right. Historically Montana has sent democratic senators since joining the union. There‚Äôs only one or two exceptions where Montanans sent republican senators to Washington. 

Right now Steve Bullock (D) has a high approval over 60%. Let‚Äôs hope that means something. 
If Jon Tester (D) was able to defeat his challenger in 2018 when Trump was at the top of the ticket then Bullock definitely has a chance against Daines."

UCI,fo4kymx,t1_fo4c2vs,1587506311.0,The talks are in the process.  I just finished speaking to a professor and the professor told me UCI administrators have brought to their attention to get ready to make their classes online because going online is in play
UCI,fo27blc,t1_fo26dh1,1587452037.0,"No worries! Again, Congratulations üêúüçΩüíôüíõ Zot Zot Zot!"
UCI,fo274l7,t1_fo263q2,1587451856.0,How do you know that with certainty? I was a regular applicant and was admitted so I am a stranger to how that works. I would assume piq would still be considered if the process is holistic
UCI,fo25v5t,t3_g59vvv,1587450699.0,"Is not dumb to turn down UC Berkeley over UCI. Is fair to say like me and many of us here at UCI have come across many students who have turned down Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD over UCI. People have turned down USC over UCI. Personally my roommate had turned down Berkeley over UCI and he loves UCI. UCI has been his dream school. 
Don‚Äôt worry about resources. UCI has plenty. Is all what you make out of it. I have friends that went to UCLA and Berkeley and ain‚Äôt doing much with their lives.  
UCI has been growing rapidly and is a top 10 public school in the nation. Just think about that.

Go where you feel at home and if UCI is the place then take UCI.  
Congratulations on your acceptance!"

UCI,fn2le4g,t3_fyxmad,1586593352.0,"Economics program is ranked #45 nationally. If numbers means anything to you. However, you are responsible to create opportunities for yourself. With this said, again, rankings are just numbers. How much investment do you want? How much effort are you willing to put?

And congratulations on your acceptance!"
CollegeVsCollege,fmycgng,t1_fmyajt0,1586482958.0,"Yeah no problem! And I would say go where ever you feel most comfortable at. 

Luckily for me Im an LA native so knowing I‚Äôll always come back to LA is why I would choose to go for Berkeley besides their program. I didn‚Äôt see it from your perspective. 
Go where your heart tells you."
CollegeVsCollege,fmxpnpy,t3_fy0g8l,1586469456.0,Berkeleys chem program is better than UCLA. No doubt!

UCI,fmnh96f,t1_fmn8zag,1586226017.0,Well he did record the lecture but does zoom because he wants everyone to participate in real time.
UCI,fmn6fzt,t1_fmmee3k,1586219192.0,The class isn‚Äôt terrible. Is interesting and the professor did a pretty good job to make sure everyone participated. But the zoomboming was just bad. Calling names drawing dicks and even those who wouldn‚Äôt mute themselves making unnecessary noises. Just not acceptable at all! I hope they get to the person drawing dicks and calling the n word. Is just fucking sad!
UCI,fmn60j5,t1_fmkkqxb,1586218935.0,I am in that class. I felt so bad for the professor especially because that‚Äôs his first class.
