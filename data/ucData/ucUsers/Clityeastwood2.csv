UCSD,fp38cp1,t1_fp2y54q,1588274858.0,Are the released grades post curve? Or is he still gonna add the curve?
UCSD,foqx6qi,t1_fopjjf5,1588002397.0,"Same, where are the midterm review questions I’ve just been doing the book problems"
UCSD,foor1b9,t1_fooqzqv,1587944637.0,Appreciate it
UCSD,fookuls,t1_fooiuxv,1587940979.0,So taking 3 quarter of any of these classes will fill that requirement? Because that is one year of upper division biology right?
UCSD,fookrxu,t1_fooiglp,1587940935.0,Would a combination of these classes fill that requirement? I just want to be cautious so that I don’t mess up but I appreciate it
UCSD,fonzr6c,t1_fonzkqq,1587929681.0,It’s also gonna come to your picking time like you said. You’re gonna have to sacrifice one of these classes because you can’t get all of these in first pick so look at CAPES and rate my professor to know which is best to first enroll in and then which is better for second enrollment
UCSD,fony9b6,t3_g8jy76,1587928839.0,"This is definitely doable the only concern would be professors that are offering the course. Some chem professors are easy some are more work heavy and make things more complicated than they should be. Same goes for the physics class but the labs are generally very easy and manageable. I think you could do it considering I did and I’m not the smartest yet still managed. You just gotta put the time in to do all the work instead of leaving it all for last minute before an exam or due date.

Edit: also depends on which college you’re in because their freshman writing sequences have varying difficulties and time commitments."
UCSD,foc6ayn,t1_foa4fcp,1587667606.0,I live in downtown SD and I look out my window to see these idiots protesting that they have right to freedom and that they can’t be stopped and it makes me sick to my stomach to see these people doing this because they are being selfish and more disgusting being very dangerous and careless in these large groups saying how quarantine is unconstitutional. It genuinely pisses me off
UCSD,fnyf4ae,t1_fnyf005,1587361240.0,I’m in that same boat expect I gotta make a documentary style film. Might just have to do it myself because I’m not trying to get dragged down by people who don’t carry their weight
UCSD,fnyag65,t1_fnyae1q,1587357509.0,Was this for CAT 3? You did the whole project by yourself? Why did you decide to carry everyone?
UCSD,fny1ovn,t1_fny1e6t,1587351273.0,"There are portions we have to do individually but that then have to be put together such as the annotated bibliography but they aren’t even responding to my texts about our topic ideas so how am I supposed to do the annotated bib if no one is agreeing on a topic. The professor wants us to collaborate because the whole point of CAT 3 is that but I am tempted to ask her if I can solo the project but I feel like that’ll rub her the wrong way, should I ask anyway?"
UCSD,fnnyq3l,t3_g2o8iy,1587105979.0,I emailed the chem department asking the chances of them opening more seats and they said it is highly unlikely and as of right now these are the maximum seats they can hold
UCSD,fnnyjvp,t3_g2whlw,1587105815.0,I’m equally as worried about this however my aunt is an admissions officer at a medical school and she did tell me that during this time they understand the limitations that are being set or how it may be unsafe for students to work at hospitals and she said they are taking that into consideration with the next waves of applicants. So I would say it is ok to be worried but from her standpoint she said that they have come to a collective decision that this cannot be held against students or weaken their applications. Hope that answer helped you out
UCSD,fnnggm3,t1_fnmft09,1587091804.0,"I wouldn’t say it’s related to 20C very heavily because I did much better in math 18 than 20C. From math 18 I learned the basics of matrices like solutions for them linear independence or dependence, null/column spaces and a couple other things like eigen vectors and matrices. It really wasn’t a whole lot I think total we only covered 4-5 chapters in the duration of 10 weeks. Very doable in 5 weeks in my opinion and I’m not the smartest math person but still got an A by doing the homework, podcasting and understanding the material conceptually (which is extremely helpful for exams)"
UCSD,fnmdoml,t3_g2ae8c,1587069564.0,Math 18 is conceptual but the workload is very easy in my opinion compared to that of 2B. I would definitely go with math 18 especially with the summer sessions faster pace as during the year I felt math 18 was kind of slow so the I think the faster pace is actually the perfect pace for the subject
UCSD,fnlpldt,t3_g2cq68,1587057542.0,I’m in young 6B too and I’m kinda worried for the midterm the quarter is already hard enough with it being online and all the extra work and he said he isn’t going to release any practice midterms either
UCSD,fnk9s0s,t3_g286zj,1587019406.0,Do you think with it being online that sections will become bigger? Like for spring I know of professors who let a lot of students off the waitlist you think summer sessions will be the same?
