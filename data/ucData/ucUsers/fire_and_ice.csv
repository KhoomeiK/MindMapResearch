KillingEve,fpccsom,t3_gcfwh4,1588495703.0,"Nope.   I was hoping in Season 2 he would be one of Villanelle's victims.  Every time he is on-screen with Eve, I feel this nameless guilt that comes from empathizing with Eve's character.  I suspect early in their relationship Eve presented herself as being something she wasn't (super basic) and it probably wasn't a lie because until Villanelle came along, she was happily toiling along in the bowels of MI5 and was probably super basic."

pcmasterrace,fp3wp45,t3_gawee2,1588287215.0,I'm still going to get owned by some 9-year old in Kansas on a console.  No one has reflexes faster than fucking 9-year olds from Kansas.  NO ONE.
PhilosophyTube,fp34gk7,t3_gaxmvy,1588272918.0,"It's not worth the expenditure of emotional energy and time to argue or try to convert Nazis.  I would say you made the right choice.  Also, I don't think prolonged interactions with Nazis is really great for one's mental health.  I am grateful to people like Natalie Wynn who have made a deep dive into those cultures, and emerged being able to explain why mass shooters come out of the incel community and things like that.  But even for her (I think she's tough as nails) there seems to be a high emotional price paid."

Flagstaff,fp1aje9,t1_foz9o5i,1588229237.0,That's the reason for having strikes like this.  There is no point of having one in a liberal state where the governor and the legislature support rent forgiveness.
Flagstaff,fp17xh2,t3_gac3i6,1588226971.0,Does it count as participation if you don't actually have any money at the moment?  I guess that would be forced participation.

SandersForPresident,foq7ogs,t1_foq5cmr,1587985901.0,"These are exactly the same arguments (guilt trips) used to persuade people to vote for Hillary in 2016.  They didn't work then, and they most definitely are not going to work now with a far weaker candidate with skeletons in his closet.  He is probably going to lose.  So where does the blame lie? With the independent voter who registered Democrat just so they could vote for a progressive candidate like Warren or Bernie and has minimal interest in voting for another neoliberal?  Or does it lie with the Democratic party itself for settling on such a lame candidate?  It rests with the latter.  Nominate better candidates that inspire people.  They had a great field to pick from this time, and they blew it."
SandersForPresident,foq3vxu,t1_foq142r,1587982059.0,"The people aren't going to do any better under a Biden administration.   The cold truth is for the vast majority of people in this country, it doesn't matter who wins.  They are getting screwed either way."
SandersForPresident,fopw38b,t1_fopvb16,1587974075.0,"I don't think Bernie has a cynical view of reality.  My views are pragmatic.  I was planning on holding my nose and voting for Biden, but I ended up looking into the Tara Reade accusations and I believe her.     Also, Biden has always been a company man and will do the bidding of his masters.  I am not voting for a rapist and a corporate-yes-man."
SandersForPresident,fopuwcq,t1_fopttz6,1587972936.0,"Your imagination is a little limited.  I can imagine quite a few possibilities that would be much worse than Trump.  Anyway, someone like Biden really doesn't need the votes of Sanders supporters.  Our numbers are far too few to make a difference.  And Biden is going to be the nominee because he is the most electable.  Stomping Trump should be a cake walk for him.  I am positive he will defeat Trump by wide margins."
SandersForPresident,fopt1m5,t1_fops48b,1587971185.0,"Voting for Biden plays into the hands of the DNC, because it means they can treat progressives as a captive constituency and don't have to pay one iota of attention to your needs or concerns.  And after Trump is out, the GOP will run someone just as awful, and this tired canard will be raised again by the DNC.  As long as it keeps working, they'll keep doing it."
OldSchoolCool,fohl9pb,t1_fohk9ov,1587767839.0,"I also remember that being east European, Einstein's parents and relatives looked down on her.  They were Jewish so other Germans looked down on them, but it was a long time before the Nazis, so they were living in the fiction that they were good middle-class Germans like everyone else (which included sharing the xenophobic prejudices of everyone else).    Having a love child back then would have been socially pretty bad, and 99% of the blame I'm sure would have fallen on the woman."

LateStageCapitalism,fo78z28,t1_fo6s223,1587574292.0,The SPD used Freikorps to assassinate Rosa Luxemburg/Karl Liebknecht and that created a bitter division between the Communists and the SPD.  If they had been united the centrists might not have found the Nazis to be the sane choice.  Everything was falling apart during the late Weimar period and people wanted stability.

Another thing that happened was they went over to using the Athena system, and people were having to give up their Unix B accounts which the university had been handing out to new students since the school was founded."
democrats,fnfds10,t1_fnbpt54,1586906144.0,I think we're going to get 4 more years of the circus.  It's infuriating because there were so many strong candidates to choose from and the party went with the least electable one in  the bunch.  Which they have a strong history of doing.  Obama was an outlier.
SubredditDrama,fne8sty,t1_fne7m0j,1586885066.0,"I've spent quite a large part of my life in small towns in the Midwest, and those white swing voters who don't have college degrees that the Democratic party is so hot for are going to go for Trump.  They hate the Democratic party, because the Democratic party long ago abandoned them and became the party of managers and working professionals.  The GOP has abandoned them too, but the GOP has been smarter about emotionally manipulating that segment to get the votes they need."

Doesn't seem like a small coalition to judge by the size of Bernie's rallies, or to judge by the statements Biden has been making,  in an attempt to reach out to them.  And if Biden loses, despite their insignificance, they will bear the blame for that loss just as they did in 2016."

democrats,fmtf2pq,t1_fmtcnar,1586371636.0,There was a portion of older female voters in the Democratic party who were completely devoted to her. I even knew a younger woman who was a roommate of my friend that talked about Hillary like she was Eva Peron. The best that can be said for Biden is he is not Trump.  That's not going to be enough to win.
