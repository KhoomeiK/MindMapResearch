buildapc,fpmeaze,t1_fpjo79n,1588731199.0,"Yeah, it happens with computer hardware fast.  Honestly computer parts get outdated about every five years to the point that it’s even difficult to use them.  I always try and go with the newest GEN hardware every 3 years, and I find by keeping my total bill at right around $1000 that usually it is a pretty solid computer for about three years.  I suppose that one could go with lesser components and build a pretty decent computer for about $700, especially if you can reuse one or two key parts like the case, peripherals and OS.  I definitely don’t believe in future proofing, as the sickest $5000 computer today will be out matched by a $1000 computer six or seven years from now if history is any precedent. Buy modern."

Expect absolute garbage at that price, and far from campus (like out on Poleline in the high density condos, or possibly in the trailer park). You can definitely find some better values toward Vacaville and Sacramento if you're willing to commute (honestly not a bad option for many people). Honestly, if you're a serious buyer you need to talk to a real-estate agent. There are several companies in town that can help you figure this out. Talk to a professional."

Tough for professor to be instructor, teacher, counselor, motivator, personal coach, confidant, friend, leader, etc all at once. The university has resources to help students that are struggling to an extent. Professor's don't have time to provide life coaching on an individual basis to each of their students. These resources are considerably more thorough by the way if needed:

It is a very serious concern, and signals a deeper underlying problem that needs to be addressed."
UCDavis,fp4z0rf,t3_gbb0nw,1588311242.0,"If the exam was supposed to be closed internet, then yes I think this is perfectly ethical and that the cheaters should get referred to SJA.

If the exam was open internet, it's a little weirder for me to think about. So then, the teacher set a trap, probably because they already suspected some students were using Chegg and wanted to see if anyone would cite the source. If the students were just supposed to cite their sources or something, this is a much different situation to be in and the violation is considerably less flagrant. 

In both cases I don't see any ethical issues from the teachers side. Teachers have to get creative to these days to combat cheating - any many are getting very good at it. The issue in my mind is more what the rules of the exam were compared with how the students acted. If it was supposed to be a closed internet exam, and many students went online to hunt for answers, then yeah, that's pretty messed up. I certainly wouldn't want any of those people being police officers, or lawyers, anytime soon."

If you have any doubts and you live off campus you should probably contact the Davis Police Department. If you’re on campus I would contact the campus PD and ask them.

The problems you identify are real and everyone is facing them around the world. You think your campus administrators and professors are immune to the same concerns you mention? We all face it. UC and other institutions are not responsible for this and there is nothing anyone can do to quickly fix this. 

Would you prefer that schools put all student's educations on hold around the world, is that a better solution then imperfectly trying to keep people moving forward and growing as best as possible? It's remarkable to me how quickly the schools (k-12 and universities) have adapted. 

Don't panic about the recession and the world ending. We are not preparing for the end times right now.

UCDavis,fmq8nu8,t3_fwb56v,1586294948.0,"One likely scenario is that widespread testing begins and we will be able to determine who has had it. Very likely many more people have it, or have had it, then we know about, which would make it more likely campus would reopen. Requiring wearing masks in groups without social distancing, better treatment options, and possibly a vaccine emerging would change the situation for public gatherings dramatically also. I would personally guess that campus will be open in the fall. There is a strong possibility of a resurgence next year after we get the current outbreak under control, but hopefully by then we will have more effective treatment options and it won't be so scary. Right now this is a dangerous time to get it because there is essentially no effective intervention. For example, if you get put on a ventilator and survive, which is already unlikely you will live, your life will be permanently changed. Everyone is talking about ventilators like that's a solution, but the reality is that most people put on a ventilator die, and if they survive their lungs and likely other internal organs will be permanently damaged. So hopefully during this summer a lot of research will come out about treatment and intervention that will dramatically reduce the need to intubate severe patients. If that happens, I think people will be able to go back to their pre-covid-19 lives."
