ucla,fpkxzyi,t1_fpim4gt,1588702989.0,Anyone who votes for every single person on a slate is just contributing to a shitty USAC. Read up on candidates and don't just vote based on a party's clout. There are good and bad candidates on both slates. \^
ucla,fpkv99f,t1_fpkpa95,1588701629.0,"His opponent Emily, is running with FTP and has platforms that would cost thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. Go with candidates that \~actually\~ know how to make change given their budget and desires of students on campus."
ucla,fphxvui,t3_gdkfxq,1588629833.0,"Oh my gosh, this should literally be illegal. FTP is collecting student's phone number without consent and claims to be trying to help them. How? By violating privacy laws?"
ucla,fphwwtz,t1_fphutar,1588629316.0,"Please do not vote for candidates who do not even show up for the debates and do not have their own platforms!!! Do not vote for Elijah(FTP) , Jong (CCI), and Viktor.

Vote for Sam, Justin, Clare, Andrea, and Atharva!!!"
ucla,fpdkfb7,t3_gctlg1,1588528736.0,"Sachi is running with For the People and her and her slate have repeatedly attacked Orion. Just an FYI for anyone on this thread. Downvote as you will, USAC shills.

Edit: Not just her, but also her slate."
