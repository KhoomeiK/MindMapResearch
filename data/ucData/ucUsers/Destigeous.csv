csMajors,fp67th4,t1_fp5zdlw,1588347632.0,"diversity can be a part of the estimator. i am not saying otherwise. maybe minorities perform much better at the job than they show in the hiring process. maybe the diversity increases the performance of the existing employees in whole or in part (maybe the minorities). such cases should already be reflected in the estimator and i am not against it.

all i am saying since the beginning is if such a thing is not part of the estimator, forcing it into the hiring process will most likely not yield higher quality hires because it simply is introducing a random variable into the problem and assigning an arbitrary non-zero weight to it.

so aside from that discussion, why do i think google does it? i find it hard to believe that google or any other company actually discovered such a pattern like the ones i mentioned in the first paragraph as examples, not because i dont think they cannot exist but because i would expect it to be very subtle and inseperable from the noise in the data. i think they do it because they believe in this version of equality (whatever it is, opportunity, outcome or something in between or else) and want to give a boost in this direction but also for publicity. google is a big company that does not have problems with survival and can afford to make necessary sacrifices if they so wish. and that better publicity is also helping them if not already compensating for whatever damage arbitrarily modifying the hiring process deals. in the full neoliberal sense, a company can do whatever they want. but let's not forget, we also implemented anti-discrimation laws for employment for the same reason."

you are just playing the stupid knitpicking game and not saying anything that we dont know.

'looking for candidates with features that correlate with quality' is your estimator.

now design an estimator in whatever way. but at hiring instead of fully using the estimator, introduce random bias for certain groups. you won't be hiring better."

FAANG are not your typical companies. they know what they are doing. they have teams specialized to configure the hiring. they know everything you know and more. and this is their solution. this is the best way known to them that serves them. stop disagreeing. but ranting and venting are free of course, i dont judge"

cs is really competitive and it's a difficult. it makes people more competitive and those who sucxeed or think they succeed get a boost to their ego.

seeing more men in this demanding field may fallaciously be making people assume non-men are not good enough. it may also be that since statistically most of the successful ones are simply because there are more men, people may be falsely assuming a non-man is less likely to be as successful as a man.

if 100 men are hitting on you you cannot blame those individuals because 100 people are hitting on you. they are not responsible for other 99 men are also hitting on you. i am sorry it sucks for you but there is no one to blame here. you are simply caught in supply&demand.

also know this people in this field tend to be closer to the autism end of the spectrum because dealing with machines and abstract systems and paradigms is not for an average person. those people are better at systemizing and worse at empathizing. systemizing is what this field is all about. it also is a more-male trait and thus this is a male-dominated field.
