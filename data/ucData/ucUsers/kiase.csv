ucla,fphesi0,t1_fpfoslx,1588620006.0,I‚Äôm double majoring in two north campus majors and have used a blue book maybe 3 times for all my upper divs & lower divs. I think this is generally geared toward GEs where I used a blue book for like every single midterm and final.
vegan,fp987bo,t3_gbx8e4,1588418036.0,It‚Äôs so crazy how many professional epidemiologists and paleopathologists found their way to this thread!!! Love seeing how many experts found this sub to insist on information they‚Äôve never academically studied or researched ü§©
ucla,fox0kj1,t1_fowuwyy,1588131228.0,"Anthropology has a few related to criminology and forensic anthropology. Sociology has several courses on crime, deviant behavior, and violence. Comm has several forensic courses. I‚Äôm sure you could find some in Poli Sci or history too, these are just the programs I‚Äôve personally seen offer them, but I‚Äôd check the registrar for course listings in different majors."
ucla,fowu2oe,t3_g9xzb2,1588127160.0,There are individual classes focusing on those things in a variety of majors but I don‚Äôt think they offer a specific program like that. You may be able to design your own major though since they offer related coursework? You can also definitely get in contact with professors who have research interests in those areas to get involved.
tifu,fnr3jog,t1_fnqfzpd,1587178436.0,"It doesn‚Äôt get under my skin, nor have I defended OPs actions. I just think it‚Äôs completely pointless to comment ‚ÄúHey OP you really fucked up!‚Äù on a post literally entitled ‚ÄúToday I Fucked Up.‚Äù

You asked ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt this higher up?‚Äù I was simply explaining that its redundancy was the reason why."
ucla,fnprw2k,t1_fnpfogi,1587150868.0,"Most of the time students don‚Äôt vote. Voter turnout for last years election was less than 20% and most of those people don‚Äôt vote on or just vote yes on the referenda because they don‚Äôt know what they are. If you don‚Äôt want student fees to increase for this referendum, then you need to vote, and hope that the majority of voters agree with you."
ucla,fnpfi5t,t1_fnpeca5,1587144596.0,You can vote ‚Äúno‚Äù on the CUB referendum on MyUCLA when the ballot comes out if you want to vote against the fee increase.
ucla,fnpf8c6,t1_fnpen9t,1587144462.0,They don‚Äôt have that power. It has to be passed by the student vote.
tifu,fnpd7wg,t1_fnp07qq,1587143454.0,"Gee, really wonder if OP, who posted this to TIFU, knows if it was fucked up to ghost the restaurant."
tifu,fno73y1,t1_fno59ls,1587114565.0,"It‚Äôs kind of a stressful time for everyone. I think it‚Äôs okay to acknowledge the fact that they messed up (hence posting in TIFU) and also be happy they went back to right a wrong. I don‚Äôt think anyone is praising OP for ghosting the restaurant, but rather for fessing up to the fact they fucked up and trying to make it right rather than pretend like it never happened (which is what a lot of people in this situation would probably do)."
tifu,fno4b0p,t1_fnnzn2p,1587111548.0,"It isn‚Äôt higher up bc this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúasking for advice‚Äù sub. This is a ‚ÄúI acknowledge I did the wrong thing,‚Äù sub. Clearly this is the right thing to do, but it wouldn‚Äôt have been a fuck up if they did the right thing."
tifu,fno45b3,t1_fnnx2vt,1587111377.0,Pretty sure this is why it‚Äôs labeled a TIFU. If they did the right thing from the beginning it wouldn‚Äôt be a FU.
Jeopardy,fnnn2y2,t1_fnn8r6n,1587096317.0,"Agree. No one should be mean, but by agreeing to be on a televised program and purposefully buzzing in for a category you clearly have limited knowledge in you should be ok with receiving a little bit of criticism for your response.

In other words, no one should attack her, but it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to laugh at or criticize the response."
ucla,fnfg4cg,t1_fnfaz6e,1586907397.0,I guess 2 could be if you‚Äôre looking into grad school sometimes they frown upon taking classes P/NP? Idk I can‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôd care given the circumstances rn though.
ucla,fn4pfey,t1_fn4jmrx,1586646138.0,"We don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs 100% possible that text is fabricated, but people on this sub love to brigade against a common foe once every few weeks and this is their latest excuse."
ucla,fn24qf3,t1_fn24ppc,1586577803.0,clever ;)
ucla,fn24n51,t1_fn23f74,1586577732.0,"My comment is not meme-able enough to make this work, it‚Äôs pretty boring frankly, but ok. Glad you spent the time to change the capitalization of the whole comment lmao"
ucla,fn21v1o,t3_fypxpl,1586575651.0,"Listen I might be downvoted to high hell and I‚Äôll accept that but I‚Äôd just like to say something. I am not a member nor have I ever or will ever be a member of USAC. In most situations you can find me shitting on how useless they are and how their stipend is exorbitant considering what they do. But frankly, I find the anti-USAC posts on this sub bordering on disgusting at the moment. Despite everything going on in their lives rn, pretty much every member of USAC is continuing to speak out and fight for students to the admin rn in order to make our lives more manageable. There are obvious problems with the budget for USAC, but if you take one second to think how hard it is considering everything happening right now to still continuously fight for students‚Äô needs (see their letters about graduation and p/np grading as just two examples), then you‚Äôll realize it‚Äôs not fair to shit on them for trying their best in a shitty situation. I‚Äôm honestly sick of how volatile this sub is when they encounter something they dislike ‚Äî I honestly would expect more out of UCLA students and I‚Äôm really disappointed how you treat fellow Bruins."
ucla,fn1fyfs,t1_fn17gsr,1586561204.0,There have been maybe 3 max stories written on the block parties. Whereas they publish a recap of USAC meetings literally every week. On the website there‚Äôs a literal tag for stories on [student government](https://dailybruin.com/category/news/student-government/).
ucla,fmybhlo,t1_fmxraw3,1586482328.0,"Sorry I think I misread your initial question, because I use Slack for just general group chats but Zoom for weekly meetings for my org (bc the Slack video function is kind of crap). But what do you mean by managing all group members?"
ucla,fmq6fkw,t3_fwsc6p,1586293741.0,"Zoom is not bad, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been using. You can put up polls on zoom and share your screen for the calendar."
ucla,fmp9xee,t3_fwfj8c,1586277111.0,"Going to be honest, you‚Äôre going to hear loud noises pretty much no matter where you live in the north village ‚Äî people throw parties throughout the apartments. If you need a noise-free area you should look in the Hilgard/Tiverton area."
ucla,fmcwwgj,t1_fmco9ov,1585954476.0,Heard the same as you from more than one of my professors. Wonder if different departments are being told different things...seems strange.
