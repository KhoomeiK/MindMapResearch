I too care about not having a nominee with sexual assault allegations against them. But I don't get to have this, even though I voted for, donated to, and volunteered for Warren."
berkeley,foy42tz,t1_fohnid1,1588164820.0,"That's great. Wishing you luck.  It isn't the best odds, but it's definitely possible.  I know two other people who appealed, and were not approved. But their appeals were more because they were just not loving their second choice rather than feeling so strongly that they belonged at Cal.  I identified with your strong feeling that Berkeley was the place for you. Hopefully whoever goes over your appeal will see that too. And either way, I'm sure you'll end up there at some point if that is what you really want. Good luck!"
berkeley,fohkp37,t3_g7ghw3,1587767567.0,"I felt similar- that Berkeley had to be the place for me. A friend of a friend reminded me about the appeal option. I had a pretty crazy story/unfortunate circumstances in high school, good grades senior year, and an amazing teacher who wrote me an amazing letter.  I delivered these on the last day that appeals were accepted, and I ended up getting in for Fall.    


I'm not sure if appeals are still an option, but something to consider. If my appeal hadn't worked, I was planning to transfer as a junior after two years at my community college."

survivorsofabuse,fmxdsuq,t3_fxljz6,1586463114.0,"I'm really struggling with this as well.  With over 20 credible allegations for the current office holder, I can't stop my disgust until he is out of office.  His challenger seems to have several credible allegations, and yet they seem less severe?  but how is this acceptable?  I had resolved to voting for the woman who had the best chance of winning, and I got to do that in my primary, but of course that's all over now.  And I cannot handle the idea of RBG being replaced with another SCOTUS justice like the last one.  There are real consequences.    


I am heartened by the idea of a female VP; and will be even more excited if the challenger (I seriously cannot say name of any predator, including my own) announces he will not run for re-election in four years. Sigh.  But disappointing that we got here. Everyone was voting out of fear. 

TLDR: I totally agree that is triggering, yet I'm planning to reluctantly vote for the 'better' of the candidates with lesser amount of credible allegations for other reasons than supporting him."
