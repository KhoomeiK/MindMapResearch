That's a red flag for me. It's not going to take just one session to work through any kind of trauma, it's going to take a lot more. I suggest keep doing more research yourself, bring all this up to your gf, and set up an appointment with someone else to get a second opinion. Good luck!"

Healthyhooha,etoi7e6,t3_ccnbpp,1563028398.0,"Hey man, I think it's amazing that you're on here trying to figure out what you can do for her. 

When my husband and I first started dating, we had sex every day. Over the years, because of birth control and depression, I barely have a sex drive, and his is still nice and high. However, our sex life is currently better than it's been in a long time, and here's what's worked for us:

Lots of lube. My body doesn't really help out, so we use it every time. 

My husband always makes me feel desired. He'll smack my butt randomly and make a 'yum' kind of sound, or start feeling me up out of nowhere and tell me how sexy I am, and then we usually make out for a bit. It really goes a long way in making me feel like a sexual being, and it makes me more attracted to him. 

He also focuses on me in the bedroom, makes sure that I'm doing good during all stages of sex. He gets off on me getting off, and when he's putting in the work, it works.

Lastly, I say yes to sex even when my sex drive isn't up and I'm not feeling it. This is more advice for your girlfriend, but Ill say yes if my husband asks, and I don't put a lot of pressure on myself to be at my best, I just try to relax and enjoy doing this wonderful and intimate act with my husband. And most of the time, we end up having great sex and both finishing by the end.

I hope this helps! It's sounds like your relationship is solid, and this is just a challenge to overcome together :)"

It took us a couple of years but we've hit a good groove and learned exactly what positions feel best for both of us. He gets off on me getting off, and at this point I come twice on average. The pain in the first couple years is worth the mind blowing sex now."
