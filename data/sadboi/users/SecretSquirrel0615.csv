AskReddit,fqs23pr,t1_fqr0hfu,1589596807.0,"Yep... I didn’t finish my bachelors until I was 39 bc I got married first and had to work because we needed both salaries to stay afloat.  At one point I had 3 jobs and was going to school part time.  The shitty thing is we decided to get divorced the year I graduated.  I also would have gotten some sort of medical degree if it weren’t for him.  I didn’t because at the time he was afraid of blood borne pathogens (smh).  We’re still friends, but I learned that I will never let another person have such a large say in my life choices.  Now I struggle with the thought of going back for another bachelors for some sort of medical degree... I want to do it, but I also am enjoying having a life since work and school took up so much of it before. - not to mention more student loan debt.  I tell every kid I meet - live with your parents now and get college over with. There will be plenty of time for relationships after that."

My dr said the deadly rash is very rare.  I wouldn’t worry about it, but if you do get a rash to go to the Dr or Er right away.  Keppra can cause bad mood swings.  If you’re uncomfortable with lamictal I would see about Depakote (Valproic Acid).  It has bad side effects of its own, like weight gain, but it’s been on the market for many years."

However chin up - you will regain control. The brain and body are remarkably adaptable.  It will just take some time. I also had a friend who was an officer who had a brain tumor removed and lost vision in his eye. He couldn’t be an officer anymore because he needed to qualify at the gun range with the good eye shut.  But he is still doing well and is adapting. Give it time.  Don’t dwell on you used to be able to do “xyz” thing think of it more in terms of I used to do it this way, now I have to learn to do it this way.  Your brain will build new neurons that will help you adapt.  You just have to work with it and don’t let it get the best of you.  Easier said than done, especially when you’re dealing with a loss, but don’t worry it will come to you.  

Right now, concentrate on getting better!!! I want you healthy.  The chemo drugs probably aren’t helping you see your full potential yet.  They are probably masking everything because of the way they effect your body. Let them do their job first, and get better. Then you can worry about getting back to normal.  I also have brain issues, now controlled but for a while I couldn’t drive in my state either due to seizures.  The loss of your personal freedom totally sucks.  You’ll get through it.  I promise.

I’m going to let you in on a little secret... be confident- even if you’re faking it.  People are drawn to confidence. Trust me, I’ve been in a similar position as you.  Think as if every aspect of your life that you’re nervous about is a play and mentally prepare yourself for the parts that are more like monologues. Before going into a situation think about the scenario and what you might say.  Either way don’t let them see you’re nervous. If you’re confident in who you are then they will want to know more about what makes you tick. Fake it ‘till you make it. 

Anyway, I could be way off point - I hope I’m not.  But I can see the sadness in your eyes and that you have a beautiful soul. Continue to be strong, nothing is constant but change and this state won’t last forever.
