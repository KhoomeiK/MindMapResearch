overclocking,fi6m08t,t1_f79ne03,1582200600.0,"So after extensive testing with Asus RealBench and the video-games I play the most, my stable voltage under load is around 1.28 - 1.29v (Voltage is set to 1.32v but with vDroop it goes down to 1.28 - 1.29v) with LLC set to 5.


To lower my idle vCore, should I change my voltage to 1.28 - 1.29v and set LLC to level 6 - 7 and test for stability? Would it be a better scenario than the one I have right now?

Regarding OCCT runs, I'd leave it for at least 4 hours (small data set with AVX is the most demanding stress test).

overclocking,f9n7i26,t3_e61tdv,1575478660.0,You probably have an AVX offset of 2. AVX is a demanding CPU instruction and either your MOBO automatically sets the offset at 2 or you did it following a tutorial without knowing exactly what it did. Try disabling it and see if it's stable at 1.35. If it is lower your vCore until it isn't or aim for a higher clock. If you have any doubts here we are to help you out :)

GPU overclocking is very simple. Get MSI Afterburner if you don't have it already and set your power and voltage draw offset to the max. Also adjust your fan curve. After that, change the offset of the core first, 15 MHz at the time until you see artifacts / crash on Unigine loop. At that point, go back to your last stable offset on Unigine. Play your favorite (GPU-intensive) video games for two or three days. If you see artifacts / crash go back 15 MHz until you don't. Then again, test that offset for two or three days. When you stop seeing artifacts and / or stop crashing, keep that core offset and repeat the whole process with your memory offset now.


The two to three days rule is to assure stability, of course you can do it in a day if you play a lot and do so on GPU-intensive games.

overclocking,f7xvnwu,t3_dy1rd5,1574077537.0,"I sent this following mini-guide for an Asus MOBO originally, some settings may vary since you have a Gigabyte one:

Update your BIOS.

Enable XMP.

Set the CPU core ratio to sync all cores and input your target frequency (if it's 5.2GHz input 52)

Disable multi core enhancement

Disable CPU SVID (for now, if you later want to switch to adaptive then enable it again)

Set AVX offset to 0

I don't know the LLC values of Gigabyte MOBOS, but start by setting an intermediate one.

Set CPU Core/Cache Current limit to 9999 (should change to 255.70 or something similar)

Change CPU Core/Cache voltage to Manual, 1.29v (depending on stability you might have to go above it, if it's stable at 1.29 try going below it. At 5.2 probably above it)

Go to ""Internal CPU Power Management"", set both Short Duration and Long Duration Power Limits to max (4095)

Set CPU current capability to the max %

Save changes and exit. Run benchmarks like Realbench (the one I recommend if your OC is gaming-oriented) for at least 2 - 4 hours. If it doesn't crash or give you WHEA errors try and lower the voltage by 0.01 (so from 1.29 to 1.28) / modify LLC until it does and go back to the last stable configuration. If it gives you errors / crashes before that, increase the voltage by 0.01 until it's stable.


When it's stable, you can try and change the maximum cache ratio, but be aware it gives little to no performance improvement at the cost of instability. Same witch disabling all C-States, if you don't care about power consumption. If you do care about power consumption and temperatures on IDLE, you could try an go for adaptive voltage using the highest vCore value during your stress tests.

Try to not go above 3.5 vCore and also try not using a high LLC level.

I'm not very experienced with RAM overclocking so I'll leave that to someone with more knowledge"
overclocking,f7xu1vk,t1_f7xtihk,1574075445.0,"Yes it will be fine. The only downsides would be more heat and power usage but that's it. I have a Corsair H100i PRO, under 35ºC on idle and under 70ºC on load.


If you still don't want your CPU to be working at 1.28 24/7 run some stress test for 2-4 hours (I recommend RealBench) at your desired frequency. When you find your manual stable vCore at that frequency (using LLC) use HWiNFO64 for instance to get the max vCore frequency recorded during the stress tests and use it to configure adaptive mode, keeping the LLC level (if you have an ASUS MOBO try not to go over level 5) and disabling all C-states. Also leave EIST enabled.

Do more testing and if it crashes either add 0.01 to the adaptive voltage until it's stable or change the LLC level.


To do the same with offset, it would take waay more testing since it gets its values from VID, which is not very accurate and often over-volts."
overclocking,f7xsqwt,t1_f7xsh3s,1574073528.0,"Not exactly. Offset adds or subtracts voltage from the VID voltage table through all the frequency table while adaptive only does so while in turbo mode. That's why adaptive + offset is nice, because you kinda have the best of both worlds.


Your CPU will be fine running at 1.28 24/7. If a CPU lasts for about 15-20 years, overclocking it doesn't even halve that lifespan. I have mine running at 1.32 (with LLC) at 5GHz for instance."

I wouldn't recommend going over 3.7-8v, I'd rather lower the clocks if I had to hit that vCore for a 5GHz stable OC. Anything above 80ºc while OCing is a no-no to me.


Edit: That being said, with your CPU you should be able to hit 5GHz across all cores without having to go over 1.32 vCore with LLC set to 5-6. What CPU cooler do you have? Have you disabled multicore enhancement?"

I'm guessing you have all cores synced at 5GHz and you already are controlling the vCore so to me it doesn't make sense to have it on.

It's better to have a high vCore than a high LLC setting in my opinion. LLC is there basically to counter vDroop by increasing vCore under certain loads and if your LLC setting is too high it might add more voltage than necessary so if I were you I'd increase vCore and decrease LLC.
