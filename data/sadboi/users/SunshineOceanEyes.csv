AskWomen,fr010cr,t3_glj01f,1589780616.0,"When I finally got diagnosed with severe ADHD and started taking medicines for it and went to therapy for my PTSD. 

I never tried to be the ""dumb girl"". I was really smart growing up, I was also just really fucking out of it and never knew what was going on. ""What?"" ""I'm confused."" ""I don't understand."" Because whatever was happening, I was billion miles away thinking of 1000x different other things. I was never ""stupid"". 

As far as being the manic pixie dream girl, I'm very free-spirited and get get super excited about things, I do a lot of stupid shit without thinking so the ADHD plays into that a lot I'm sure and from all the severe abuse that caused a lot of PTSD. I had to relearn boundaries and how guys were constantly taking advantage of me and being assholes. I learned to stand up for myself. So many guys constantly insist their behavior is okay and when I learned to say no and draw boundaries, many get really angry saying I'm the one who is wrong and insist they have the right to whatever it is that is making me uncomfortable and eventually telling me I'm ""uncool"" or I'm just another one of those ""dumb bitches""."

They can get help and heal the arm, but maybe they will always have a bit of an ache in their fingers or there is a scar that is always on their arm (The scar is the PTSD). Non-neurotypical is like if someone was born without an arm (this is a bit extreme but I'm not sure of a good analogy). They know how other people use the arm, they want to use an arm and they try to do the same thing as everyone else but they just can't because they were born different and they can't change it. They can have a prosthetic or ask for help but they will never have that arm (That's like taking medicine, other resources for ADHD or Autism).

PTSD causes you to have trauma to your brain, not a developmental disorder. You just have a different way of thinking because of PTSD. It's not a fun way of thinking and it can really effect how you deal with life, but with therapy, using healthy coping mechanisms etc, your thinking can become less effected by PTSD."

I know there might be some overlap in the fact that thinking seems a bit like how non-neurotypicals think but it's not the same because it's not a neurological disorder or developmental disorder.

Work on learning vocabulary over trying to perfect a sentence. You can get your point across using basic vocabulary even if the sentence isn't perfect. (I.e. using please, thank you, etc. or point to the salt and say ""Salt. Please."") You can use a combination of Duolingo, memorize, drops, babbel, etc to get a good daily repetion of vocabulary words. Look online for very young children/toddler books so you can read them and start recognizing some of the vocabulary that you've been learning. Even if you can't understand it fully, your mind is getting a repetion of words in a basic context. 

Buy a few beginner workbooks so you can work through those and it can give you a direction on where to start with grammar and how to conjugate and which grammar you need to learn first before other things. 

Watch TV shows and movies so you can hear the language and get a feel of how to pronounce words and listen for words being spoken

Agoraphobia,ffwhcxu,t1_ffwgq1v,1580301050.0,"Oh yeah, and to answer the social anxiety question. I think I overlaps very vaguely for me.

I will never give a presentation unless my life depended on it. 

I grew up in an (obviously) extremely abusive family and everything I said was used against me or I was made to feel bad about it. The thing that overlaps, I would say, is maybe feeling safe or if I am anxious about one thing, it can trigger the other. 

So if I'm anxious about meeting new people at an event, then I get scared to go, which makes me scared to leave the house, which makes me have agoraphobia."
Agoraphobia,ffwgq1v,t3_evjbkm,1580300408.0,"My agoraphobia came from when I was forced to move back to my home state and my stuff was boxed up and mailed to my grandmother and uncle and dad. I never saw any of that stuff again. 

I became homeless with my cat with no stuff. I finally found somewhere to live for a short while. I was terrified of leaving the house because I was so afraid something would happen when I was gone and the few items I had would be taken and my cat gone. I would leave a little bit to work but tried to mostly work from home.

I then had to leave and I had nowhere to go because I wasn't saving enough money since I was too terrified to leave the house that often to make enough money. I was homeless again and noone in my family would take me in for even a week for me to save enough money to put down for an apartment since I was just shy of a couple hundred. My dad's gf got pissed that everyone in my family was treating me like they didn't know me or want me around so my grandmother took me in after my dad begged her so his gf would stop bothering him.

Living with my grandmother and my pedo uncle really sealed the deal on how bad my agoraphobia got. They wouldn't let me leave unless it was for 20-30min and they would time it. Or else they would threaten to kill my cat and lock me out. I wasn't allowed a key. I wasn't allowed a job unless it was from exactly 10.30am-3pm, no other hours was I allowed to be outside the house. I wasn't allowed any friends over and if I did go somewhere with a friend, my uncle and grandmother had to interview them. The two times I went somewhere to visit a friend, I was locked out of the house at 3pm and had to sleep in my car. I didn't want to leave because I needed to make sure they didn't do anything to my cat.

My cat got super depressed and anxious because my uncle would scare him and scream at him. Everytime I would leave (to get toothpaste, food, cat food, etc) my uncle would go through my stuff. Some of my panties went missing. I would try to leave the window cracked open and everytime I'd be gone in the 20min window, the window would be shut and locked. 

The furniture and stuff I had over the years before being homeless had all been in my grandmother's garage so I started going through it all. They mostly had broken, destroyed or tore up my things. A lot of stuff was missing (and later I would see them in fb pictures at distant relatives houses, my father's house, either sisters apartments etc). 

I finally got away and eventually moved to another country but the damage had been done. When I moved, I took one suitcase and they trashed all of my stuff or took it for themselves or sold it and kept the money. I will never see any of my childhood memories or photos or books or any of my stuff again but I'm safe. 

I have a beautiful apartment with furniture and memories I've made of the past few years living here and my cat is still by my side. But the agoraphobia is still here, although not as bad as it was 4 or 5 years ago. I'm still terrified if I go somewhere, something will happen to me, or to my cat when I'm gone or I'll lose all of my stuff again or I will somehow become homeless. It's a truly terrifying feeling."

AskWomen,fem8qqp,t3_eps958,1579243892.0,"I never have. I'm always terrified I wont be able to pay for something or something bad will happen. It's kept me from having kids because I'm terrified that something will happen where they won't have a good life that I want to provide for them. Always pay rent first, bills second. You can have power turned off, but you can't be un-evicted. Don't ever get a new car, but if you do, pay car payments 2nd after rent because if you can't get to your job, then you can't pay your bills. Always have a backup plan of ways to make side money. 

Don't trust ANYONE when it comes to rent unless you 100% know they will pay it and you can trust them. If you are paying half, let your partner pay the bills and you pay rent. Don't let them claim they have half the rent and you have the other half. If they don't come up with that rent, you're fucked. 

Don't live in someone else's house if you can't trust them 100% and save for a 1st and last months deposit + 1st months rent somewhere because you never know when they can make you go homeless and know your rights to being illegally evicted.

Don't place all your eggs in one basket when it comes to someone else financially, whether it's a friend, bf/gf or family, doesnt matter. Unless you know you can fully trust them 1000%. They can fuck you over.

When I was growing up, I barely had any clothes. I would get 1 or 2 pairs of pants per year and 4 shirts. That's it. I would outgrow the pants during the year and still have to wear them, so I learned how to repair my clothes and resew them so they would fit  during the school year. Now, I have a massive problem of hoarding clothes and shoes. I've only very, very recently been able to go through them and plan on selling a lot of them and donating the rest. 

I don't feel comfortable buying new electronics at all. I hate that I'm so behind in the technological world, but I am too afraid to spend my money on something so expensive. 

I've worked a lot in therapy through feeling ""safe"" when it comes to financial stuff and I'm slowly learning to treat myself. I took my first ever vacation a few years ago and try to take super dirt cheap vacations.

I still feel terrified I'm going to lose everything all the time. I know I'm not considered well off where I live now but it's nothing close to like the poverty and poor I was back home. I don't think I could get through being homeless ever again. I have nightmares about it all the time. It's a terrifying feeling and I hate it."

Outside of work, many guys would try to get with me when they found out what my job was. The few times I fell for it, the guy suddenly either hated my job (after swearing up and down it was fine) or treated me like I was beneath them. It was disgusting the way they treated me."

It took a month to get here and noone liked it because they weren't use to the flavor. I loved it, so it wasn't a waste for me. Mashed potatoes and green bean casserole are good.

Then I'd withdraw from that semester in university and wait to go back at a better time that I wasn't working 50 hours a week. I'd sublease out that apartment that had those bitchy roommates. I'd call everyone in the family and tell them what my parents did to me so they all knew what pieces of shit they are. I don't even care if anyone would believe me or not. At least they wouldn't hear stupid sob stories from my mother for a year and think I am just cruel to not ""help"" them in times of financial need.

I'd go to my parents house and go through all the pictures and make tons and tons of copies before never seeing them again.

I'd also stop putting off learning all the languages I've learned over the years and putting off what I loved doing in fear that it wouldn't make me money. It turns out that I could've done that instead."
