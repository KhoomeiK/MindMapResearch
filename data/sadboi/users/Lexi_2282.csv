SuicideWatch,fqcr12q,t3_gi5rd7,1589266127.0,Hey! I'm Lexi and I'm 13. I feel the same way you do. If you're looking for a friend or someone to talk to My DMs are open. It gets hard but you have to stay strong for the people that need you and care about you! You are worth so much more than you know and I wish I could help you see that.
SuicideWatch,fmjrxnr,t1_fmjr27i,1586136481.0,"I hope you get better, Thank you.  <3"
SuicideWatch,fmjrw2z,t1_fmjrs7q,1586136455.0,Thank you. <3
SuicideWatch,flfdzfx,t1_flaqv58,1585104185.0,why do you think I want to die? Im here looking for a escape.
SuicideWatch,flaqcn6,t1_flap53g,1584989001.0,"Not necessarily true, some people do it because it can let them vent or help them with coping."
depression,fl6uth4,t3_fmten8,1584884051.0,I said the same thing yesterday. I just wanna know how it would affect people if I was gone.
SuicideWatch,fkz528b,t3_flddyn,1584662952.0,I get it. I drank 2 full bottles of medical alcohol and ended up in the hospital for a while. I wish I'd died then.  It would've just been easier than living in this mess that I've gotten myself into.
SuicideWatch,fkz4ppa,t3_flge42,1584662732.0,"I'm not gonna try and tell you not to kill yourself. Because I know it all sounds like bullshit.  Shooting yourself in the head? Maybe jumping from a building?  That's how I'm gonna go because they might be painful for a millisecond but they're the fastest ways to go. I don't want you to die. Because you do matter no matter how much you don't want to belive it, but if you've truly reached the end.. I wish you the best wheresoever you go after death and I hope you're in sympathy there."
SuicideWatch,fkrq3mm,t1_fkrpw7u,1584473786.0,No thank you. Talking isn't going to save me...
SuicideWatch,fjd183z,t3_facy0k,1583243094.0,"You're so brave and I'm so glad that you're okay because as much as this may sound stupid or dramatic, you do matter. I hope you speak up and get the help and support you need. We love you.  ❤"
