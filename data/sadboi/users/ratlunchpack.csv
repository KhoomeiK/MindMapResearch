‚ÄúA ‚Äútriple whammy‚Äù of good news ‚Äî led by promising results from a coronavirus vaccine trial ‚Äî buoyed investors Monday, powering U.S., stocks to strong across-the-board gains.

The Dow Jones industrial average surged nearly 700 points at the opening bell, and kept going, after Moderna announced that an early stage human trial for its coronavirus vaccine successfully produced covid-19 antibodies in participants. The biotech company said a large clinical trial to determine its effectiveness would follow in July. Moderna‚Äôs shares soared more than 25 percent.

Investors also found comfort in comments Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell made during a ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù interview broadcast Sunday. He said the central bank is ‚Äúnot out of ammunition by a long shot‚Äù in its resources to support the economic recovery, even while he cautioned that it could stretch into 2021. The comments come as most states have begun to ease restrictions on businesses and social activity after weeks of stay-at-home orders affecting some 315 million Americans.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor one, there is palpable relief that the majority of the states are reopening their economies, including 75 percent of California,‚Äù Rosenberg said in an email to The Post. ‚ÄúSecond, there is growing hope that a vaccine is coming our way sooner, rather than later. Lastly, Fed Chairman Jay Powell told investors over the weekend that the central bank‚Äôs checkbook remains wide open, strongly hinting that more monetary policy stimulus is on its way.‚Äù

It‚Äôs two hours premature for me, lol. But screw it. Half of the world is already in tomorrow and I‚Äôm too excited not to post. 

Happy TWO MONTH anniversary to everyone in this thread!! Can you believe it?! It‚Äôs been a whole sixty days! Pat yourself on the back, because you‚Äôre doing such a good job! So much has happened since this thread was created, and since it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the daily grind, I kinda wanted to give everyone a recap of some of the amazing things that have happened over the course of the last two months for a big picture focus!  There‚Äôs lots to be excited about! 

First, (Bear with me.) When this thread started a lot of countries and states had just started their lockdowns. It was a nervous and unsettling time because we didn‚Äôt know much about the novel Coronavirus, how it spread, why it was causing such intense respiratory issues, and everyone was panic buying toilet paper, eggs, and PPE.  Sellers on Amazon were price gouging hand sanitizer. A lot of us were worried about what the future would look like... would I have to start using rags in the bathroom? Will we run out of food?  Is this the apocalypse?  Rest assured (respectively) you don‚Äôt, we didn‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs not!  We‚Äôre at the point now where a lot of countries, regions and states are heading into phase 1 of easing lockdowns (albeit with a lot of restrictions) and while that may make some of you anxious... bear in mind that it is a GOOD THING!  While some of you may not be able to return to work just yet, this is a great thing for our global economy. Getting retail and nonessential services back online is going to restart the pulse of our nations, regions, and states. Getting tax revenue flowing will ensure we can continue to pay unemployment for those who can‚Äôt return to work soon, pay health care workers, police, firefighters, and other frontline workers, and get money back in the pockets of people who desperately need it!  And who doesn‚Äôt need a little retail therapy after this?! (With your mask on of course! üòâ) 

Back then, Italy was bad and the news was scary... then France, Germany, and Spain. Things were just starting in the US, Canada, and UK.  Well now Italy, France, Germany, and Spain are reporting lower and lower numbers daily with the US, Canada, and the UK following suit! Even Brazil appears to be flattening the curve! New Zealand and Australia got that shit under control. So did China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Anyone still speaking of flattening the curve? Well guess what... we did it! Most hospitals are not overrun, haven‚Äôt been and, most importantly, WON‚ÄôT be. Look at you, you rock stars.  Doing your part. A lot of places that prepared for huge surges and set up field hospitals are now taking them down, many unused!

Remember how scary it was to go grocery shopping back in March? Fearful of that suspect apple because we didn‚Äôt know if it had the virus on it?  Also guess what... we learned this thing is a wimp. Soap and water destroy the heck out of this thing!  We don‚Äôt have to sterilize all of our carrots with Clorox. We learned that washing our hands, not touching our faces, and wearing a mask in public are the best things to do to prevent transmission... imagine that! It‚Äôs that simple!  And we‚Äôve been so good about it that a lot of places are now seeing major reductions in transmission! Whew! 

Back then Worldometers was scary to look at... the case counts globally climbing every day.... but then the recoveries started coming in! And soon we were at 200K, then 500K, and before we knew it we were counting down to a million. We passed 1.5 million in the blink of an eye and now we‚Äôre at **1,658,995** at the time of writing this. Furthermore, **98%** of cases are mild!

Sporadic reports of toilet paper sightings started to trickle in. And then the eggs came back. And the bread. And then the hand sanitizer. Before we knew it, we could get most things on our grocery list. Save the N95 masks... we actually realized we don‚Äôt need those anyway!

Then Mr. Captain Tom Moore of the UK walked a 100 laps in his back yard with a goal of raising ¬£1000 for the NHS.  He raised over ¬£30 million, and we remembered that there is still beauty in the world.  Reports of charitable giving became the norm across nations, states, and communities! Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Travis Barker, and countless other celebrities got on board. Then Bill Gates as well... doing more than I can keep track of. We also learned there are a shitload of people over the age of 100 out there! 

You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd end here at two months in, but wait! There‚Äôs more!

We heard early reports of a vaccine... who was making IT?  Then it was, who was making one? Then we heard of the Oxford vaccine. It was effective in rhesus macaques. It‚Äôs now being tested in *people*. 12 to 18 months they said. Try me in 6, Oxford said. üëè Now, everyone and their grandma is working on a vaccine.  From Los Alamos to Baltimore, from sea to shining sea, from *ocean* to *ocean* there are so many vaccines being created! Rest assured, there WILL be one, likely sooner than ‚Äúthey‚Äù say. 

Lastly and latestly, its mutating. In a good way. We know that from places like ASU and Los Alamos that are doing genetic research on the virus in partnership with labs across the globe. The virus is becoming more contagious, yes, but less lethal. It appears to be following the path of its cousin, SARS.  This is really good, because the more it mutates, the more it becomes like the common cold!  We can have HOPE that COVID is just another form of the seasonal cold and HOPEFULLY soon! We may not even need the vaccine anyway! 

(Edit to add: hospitalizations are coming down while cases coming in are sort of stagnant in some places. Thus tentatively confirming the whole more contagious, less lethal idea)

And like I said, we‚Äôre only two months in!

Here‚Äôs to another month of positive news, you superstars! üçª

Anxiety,fpnynlx,t1_fpn3klu,1588775178.0,"I think even tourism can rebound by the end of the year. If everyone does their part wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.  It‚Äôs things like concerts where you can‚Äôt really distance or wear masks and probably film (again same thing) that are going to be hardest hit. Even still, I know a lot of productions are trying to figure out how they can re shoot scenes with just one actor so they don‚Äôt have to be in the same area to film.  It‚Äôs more the production crews that are gonna have a hard time. But I‚Äôm confident a lot of industries will adapt!"
Anxiety,fpmz3m9,t1_fpmo0e4,1588745528.0,KY hits close to home for me. Your recoveries from the press conference were 2058 out of 5822! So that‚Äôs awesome! I can try to dig some more and post tomorrow for you but also know it‚Äôs looking like you‚Äôre probably past your peak in cases!
Anxiety,fpmmo8y,t1_fpmmlh5,1588736491.0,^^^ yes yes yes. This.
Anxiety,fpmm4sr,t1_fplvkgp,1588736139.0,"I probably can‚Äôt put together a big picture on things right now but I can give you a personal picture. I work for one of the largest stores in my company and we‚Äôre only filling internet orders right now.  We‚Äôre used to having a 45-65k (US dollars) day in sales under normal circumstances. For the last month we‚Äôve been only averaging about 10k a day in sales.  Monday, we filled 22k and today we did 14k. So as far as retail goes... people are ready to shop. We‚Äôre about to open to curbside next week and our phone has been off the hook about it this week.  I think things will get going in some industries a LOT sooner than most people think. Our one store that did open in our district today did 40k in sales. So an average pre-covid day.  Some industries like entertainment will be on pause for a while but a lot of your average retail is gonna return to normal pretty fast!"
Anxiety,fpmlkhc,t1_fpm1tnf,1588735772.0,I love it when the two of you talk to each other. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre two alternate dimension versions of yourselves. Lol.
Anxiety,fpmkvpx,t1_fpmj27m,1588735333.0,"‚ÄúFor those of you watching at home, I'm not sure you can see this, but there are now a majority of counties where the virus is taking at least 30 days to double...
...while hospitalizations had a small increase, the number of patients reported in either critical or intensive care dropped and Judy's been reminding us, this is a big one for us to look at, to 1,534. We have now had one full week of declining numbers. Ventilator use currently stands at 1,169, and this number too continues to decline.‚Äù 

From the governor‚Äôs press update today. Hope that helps! üòä

Edit: I like y‚Äôall‚Äôs govenor. He seems very compassionate."
Anxiety,fpmhjwk,t1_fpm0ga3,1588733220.0,Oh I didn‚Äôt think about that! I guess black really would make eye makeup pop! The ones my work is issuing are black so I guess I can try playing around with some wild eye makeup.
Anxiety,fplulep,t1_fpltgdh,1588719770.0,Oh yeah. I‚Äôm like ready for Free People and Anthropolgie to get some sweet designs!
Anxiety,fplluk2,t1_fpll2hd,1588715052.0,Seriously??  Your coworker is whack.  I‚Äôm excited to wear it because I feel like it‚Äôs a cool new personalized accessory to wear!
Anxiety,fplhnpl,t1_fplankw,1588712880.0,And I thought last year was crazy....
Anxiety,fplhjv9,t1_fplgs8z,1588712825.0,Holy crap. Just wow. I‚Äôll be wearing mine!
Anxiety,fplahhb,t1_fpl9whl,1588709232.0,"Oh yeah. NY, PA, CA, WA and OR are all estimated at like 96 -100% past. That‚Äôs some major relief."
Anxiety,fplabtr,t1_fpl4ckd,1588709155.0,"Also NPR was reminding everyone that the UK has a substantially higher population than Italy or Spain. So while the death counts sound scary, it‚Äôs more likely a result of having more people not that it‚Äôs necessarily hitting the UK harder than other places."
Anxiety,fpl9ldh,t1_fpl4ow7,1588708780.0,Los Alamos National Labs is estimating a 50% chance we‚Äôre already past our peak. That means that this right now is probably the worst and it‚Äôs all going to get better from here on out. Side note: they‚Äôre estimating the same for the UK as well. And if it‚Äôs not this week it should be next week. That‚Äôs even taking reopening measures into account. It‚Äôs looking like things should be substantially better by the end of the month!
Anxiety,fpl03h1,t1_fpkzbvc,1588704022.0,Lol. I‚Äôm actually really down for this.
Anxiety,fpkqop8,t1_fpkhoqn,1588699366.0,I mean ‚ÄúVirus threatens world's oceans‚Äù is a CNN headline right now.  How you might ask would a virus threaten the ocean? Kill all of the fish? No. Environmentalists think we‚Äôre going to dump all of the used PPE in the ocean. Okay... come on now.
