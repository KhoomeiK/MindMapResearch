pregnant,fqsovhl,t3_gkios8,1589613744.0,"I second the idea of getting him a book or at least some articles from reputable websites that he may have heard of, like a medical website. I got my boyfriend the book ‘We’re Expecting’ and he seems to like it. It’s broken down into weeks so it’s not a ton to read at once. My boyfriend is pretty supportive and sweet about things, but he is also very ignorant/naive about pregnancy and baby stuff. He just has no clue because this is the first time he’s really been exposed to it. I try to assume he’s not being mean, he is just clueless and I try to educate him. He seems to do better when I have data/info to back stuff up and it’s not just like me whining about something lol. 

That being said- I was also soooo tired and exhausted my first trimester. I literally would get up at 7am, go to work, come home by 6pm and would be in bed asleep by 7-8pm. It is very very normal to be extra tired and have to sleep a lot. Now at 17 weeks I have insomnia (I’m posting this at 3am....😂😩) so it’s not necessarily going to last forever of course ❤️"

BabyBumps,fpu6r7g,t3_gf8a3d,1588905887.0,"I’m in a similar situation - not married to my baby’s father, although we do plan to potentially get married down the road sometime. We decided that baby will have both our last names, hyphenated. It works for us because neither of our last names are very long, and each is 2 syllables. If/when we get married, we may drop my last name from baby’s name, depending on if I keep my maiden name or not. If hyphenating wouldn’t have worked out, I would have given baby his/her’s fathers last name..just out of tradition I guess. He has a nice and simple last name, so that’s a plus too. 

On the flip side, my sister gave her son his fathers last name, they broke up, he is not very involved in his life, and she regrets not giving him her last name. She says it would be much simpler if they had the same last name, but she doesn’t want to deal with taking her sons father to court or fighting with him about it.

So, I’m not sure there’s a perfect answer! Go with your gut I suppose."
BabyBumps,fo8x301,t3_g6borb,1587605662.0,"Cramps! I kept having pms-like cramps for days that would come and go, but no period. I took a test not actually thinking it would be positive, but just to rule out what I thought was an extremely remote possibility I was having an ectopic pregnancy. Turned out I really was pregnant and it wasn’t ectopic after all 🙂 
Then came the fatigue, nausea, and a suuuper strong sense of smell."
BabyBumps,fo1erys,t3_g50mxy,1587431722.0,"I’m 13+2 and the whole first trimester went sooooo slow. Couple that with being at home 99% of the time, experiencing Groundhog Day over and over again because of Covid.... time is passing slowly 😂 I feel it!! 

My sister told me that the 9 months of your pregnancy are the slowest months of your life, and the first 9 months of your baby’s life go by insanely quickly. So far I’m in agreement!"

BabyBumps,fnaywfj,t3_g0k5hc,1586806258.0,"I really don’t have any advice unfortunately, but I’m an October bumper too and feel the same way, 100%, so you’re not alone! Honestly, I feel like there will always be something to worry about as long as you’re a parent. After the anxiety of pregnancy / labor & delivery / concern about the baby being alright, etc then it will be anxiety about the actual live person you’re responsible for!! From sids, to sleep issues, feeding, reaching milestones, and so on forever lol. I mean, my mother still worries about me and I’m thirty years old! So...it’s a little overwhelming haha but I really just try to focus on what I can do *today* to make sure the baby and I are both healthy and doing okay. Whether that’s trying to eat healthy, getting some light activity in, doing some journaling, making sure I try to get plenty of rest, or just getting my mind off covid with some video games, I try to just control what I can today and not focus so much on things I have no control over right now. It’s really tough, I understand. Every day is a new struggle, but I do my best. 
I also find that my anti-depressants / anti-anxiety medicines as well as weekly therapy sessions to be immensely helpful!"
BabyBumps,fmr83nv,t3_fwoo0o,1586316126.0,"It was very similar with me. At my first ultrasound, going by LMP I was supposed to be 8+2 but measured only 4+2 and was only a gestational sac. Doctor was a bit unsure about viability. However, I knew from the dates we had sex that there was no way I was 8 weeks and that the 4 weeks was more accurate. I had another ultrasound two weeks later and measured 6+5, with a yolk sac, fetal pole, and a heartbeat we could see and hear, so right on track. 
I have PCOS and a history of irregular periods, so it doesn’t really surprise me that I ovulated about 4 weeks late."

It has been a HUGE help with the physical sensations of anxiety like heart palpitations, racing heart feeling, and high blood pressure. It doesn’t take away the mental component of anxiety, but blocks that adrenaline rush jittery panicky feeling. Especially now that I’m pregnant and can’t take any kind of benzodiazepines, I’m really really glad to have the beta blockers."

Anxiety,fkslhuj,t1_fks5hfg,1584492780.0,"Anxiety causes very real physical symptoms and it is horribly hard to live with. 

YMMV, but in addition to my anxiety medications (Lexapro + Wellbutrin) my doctor also prescribed me Propranolol to help me with my anxiety related high blood pressure and heart palpitations. It helped me a lot! Now that I’m pregnant I’m on Labetalol which is similar. 🙂

Ps 10/10 would not recommend being pregnant during a worldwide pandemic 😂"
sex,fkroces,t3_fkarx8,1584472789.0,"My inner thighs are also darker. In my case, it is due to acanthosis nigricans. (I am overweight) Before I was sexually active, I was extremely self conscious about this. I worried that guys would think I was gross or dirty. However, I’ve never had any men make any comments about it or act disgusted by my skin. I’ve brought it up to a few of them and they have all told me that they don’t care and it doesn’t bother them. It may not be seen in porn very often, but it’s not uncommon in real life. The human body has many variations in skin tones and shades!"

HealthAnxiety,fk9h8il,t3_fh85ve,1583976022.0,"Propranolol helped me immensely! It’s a beta blocker that reduces the effects of adrenaline, like when I would have anxiety related heart racing or palpitations."

I have a history of high blood pressure when I am anxious/panicky/ in medical settings but it’s not “usually” high. I was previously on Propranolol to help with this too, along with anti-anxiety meds (Lexapro + Wellbutrin) of course."

BabyBumps,fixuc21,t3_fa55nn,1582826836.0,"I’m really early on in my pregnancy (roughly 5+5) but I went to see an OB last Thursday. I was classified as high risk because of my obesity and borderline high blood pressure. She referred me to see a cardiologist (for an echo/ekg) endocrinologist, and the maternal fetal medicine / high risk doctor. 
I also have already had one transvaginal ultrasound, I have another one scheduled for next week, and I also had to do a 1 hour glucose screen and a 24 hour urine sample. (That was fun! 😑) plus tons of other blood work of course. 

So far everything has been okay but the OB told me that they basically want a baseline for me, to help them down the road if I do start to develop any complications."

HealthAnxiety,f9vwzdf,t3_e77eot,1575682018.0,"So, I’ve had anxiety for about 15 years but only started taking propranolol a few months ago. I also take lexapro, Wellbutrin and occasionally xanax when it’s really bad. 
I really like the propranolol because my anxiety and panic attacks tend to make my heart race, give me flutters / palpitations, chest pain, hyperventilating, all that fun stuff, and the propranolol helps to calm that down a bit. My issue is also that when my heart is racing, or I have any other atypical sensations, even though I know it’s most likely caused by my anxiety, I worry that something is actually wrong with my heart and that I am dying or whatever. (Even though I’ve had several ekgs, and my doctor has checked me out and says I’m fine) 
So I would say that it’s been a good experience for me so far and I would recommend it. :)"
