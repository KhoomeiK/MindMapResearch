This sound like (I'm no way a professional, this is just from a fellow mental illness person who knows a lot about mental illness) depression, anxiety, paranoia etc which could just get worse and worse and more entwined the more it's ignored.

Perhaps have some of her and your friends help to convince her to just talk to someone and see how she feels.

You can only help yourself if you want help.
