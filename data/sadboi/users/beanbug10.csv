GriefSupport,fpv7bv6,t3_gel21o,1588937345.0,"Similar thing happened to me.

I found my sister unconscious on the kitchen floor, face turning purple. 

We gave CPR and emergency services came but she couldn‚Äôt be saved. She was so healthy, fit and only 19. It still doesn‚Äôt make sense. (Unknown cardiac condition)

I struggle most days with flashbacks.. when I walk into the kitchen my brain replays that night. My mum panicking, my dad sobbing, the defibrillator beeping with no response.
I panic.

Every day I feel sad, angry, confused. Why her?

She was so kind. So honest, bubbly, friendly and energetic. A one of a kind person who was so selfless and gave so much to everyone around her. She was there for me no matter what. She was everyone‚Äôs rock. The person that so many people turned to for advice and unconditional love.

I think maybe it was meant to be. 
Before she passed away, she got to catch up with all her friends and family. Which is so rare nowadays.
It‚Äôs like maybe it was meant to be and her time was up. She had touched so many peoples lives and was such an amazing person; maybe she had completed what she was put on earth to do.

I 100% believe she is here is spirit looking over me. I think your partner will be looking over you. 

It‚Äôs been nearly 5 months for me.. some days I feel okay if I‚Äôm distracted enough. Other days I just want to nap and cry and stay in bed. Some days I‚Äôm so anxious and paranoid and traumatised by flashbacks.
It‚Äôs horrible, but it‚Äôs normal. 

Live your life for him. We have now learnt how truly unpredictable life is, and how precious it is. 
It gives such a powerful perspective, and shows us how unimportant so many things are that we used to worry about.

Sending all my love your way. 
You‚Äôre not alone in this.. there‚Äôs always someone out there who cares and will support you when you need it.
Don‚Äôt pressure yourself and take it easy. 
I hope it starts to get a bit easier soon."

My little sister recently passed away.. I feel so much regret because we didn‚Äôt spend much time together over the last few years. I didn‚Äôt connect with her or anyone well because of my mental health.

Now she‚Äôs gone suddenly and all I wish for is to be able to tell her how much I love her and give her a big hug. 

It‚Äôs not your fault. 
Your sister knows you love her, and she loves you back. I 100% believe that she is with you in spirit, to guide you and watch over you. She would want you to pick up and come back stronger, make the most of life and live for her.

There‚Äôs nothing you could have said or done to change what happened. 

Remember her for all the amazing beautiful things she was, and let those aspects of her influence your own life.

It can help to write to her each day.. 
most nights I have been writing to my sister in a journal. It can help to get your feelings out and to communicate to them. 

Sending lots of love your way.

My 19 year old sister passed away really unexpectedly.
I was with her hanging out and being silly.. went for a 30 minute walk, came back and she was laying on the ground. 
My parents and I gave cpr and emergency services came but nothing could be done.

Some days are better than others. Most the time I just feel numb. Every now and again I get flashbacks and bad anxiety. In the first month I couldn‚Äôt sleep because I was afraid I would die too.

I‚Äôm so tired all the time. Have to have a nap every day. In class I can‚Äôt concentrate, and when learning about the cardiovascular system (I study veterinary nursing) I feel really scared and panicky.

I am really clingy to my boyfriend. I hate spending nights alone without him. 
I cry most nights. 

Everything reminds me of her. Songs, places, people, videos, movies. I can‚Äôt enjoy music anymore because we shared all the same favourite Artists. 
I can‚Äôt go to our favourite beach without being overwhelmed with sadness because she isn‚Äôt here.
I can‚Äôt do anything exciting or fun without it feeling pointless because I don‚Äôt have her to share it with and talk to about.

Sometimes I just break down and feel so distraught and angry and sad.
Mostly it doesn‚Äôt even feel real. It feels like a long horrible nightmare.

xxfitness,f1ti1jc,t1_f1pst2t,1569744615.0,"Yep I agree with this! I live in New Zealand and never considered myself very fit.. until I went on hikes with my friends from America, Europe etc. 
I was so much faster and more used to uphill terrain.

I can spend a long time on the stair master and it doesn‚Äôt do a lot for me"

tylerthecreator,f1lngaa,t1_f1hvqtb,1569560352.0,"It was a girl. Why disclose whether she‚Äôs white or black? Why should there be a difference? Stop generalising and adding to the divide between races. 
It‚Äôs just fucking dumb. Im not offended in the slightest, I‚Äôm not even white. I‚Äôm just dumbfounded honestly."
tylerthecreator,f1lnazm,t1_f1i3om4,1569560192.0,"The funny thing is, I don‚Äôt even identify at white. I identify as Maori, an indigenous minority group with a huge history of discrimination. 
So no, I‚Äôm not ‚Äúoffended‚Äù by the phrase ‚Äúwhite girl‚Äù. I‚Äôm actually just confused at why people think it‚Äôs necessary to disclose if a girl is white. Stop adding to the divide. 

Don‚Äôt be complaining about racism and ‚Äúminorities‚Äù if you‚Äôre just adding to the problem. 

Why bring race into a joke, phrase, or anything? If we stopped generalising based on race, and speaking like this it would allow races to integrate better and for more people to see just a person, not a black person, or a white person.
Also, not all white people are privileged, entitled or racist. Get your heads out of your asses. 

It just blows my mind how Americans have this obsession with disclosing race in irrelevant situations, then go on to complain about racism."
tylerthecreator,f1h0082,t3_d9dgx8,1569482249.0,"Why do Americans have to always say some ‚Äúwhite‚Äù girl.. why is race always brought into it? Then Americans also complain about racism. 
You‚Äôre so strange"
BPD,f1gzmpi,t3_d9fpyc,1569482002.0,"Me too. Last night my boyfriend and I were cuddling, laughing and having a great time. I thought ‚Äúwow things have been so great lately. I need to make sure I don‚Äôt do anything to ruin this.‚Äù

Then this morning I get angry and upset over pretty much nothing and he won‚Äôt talk to me now. 
There‚Äôs no end"

Honestly I think BPD is the main one for me. The others just stem from it."
