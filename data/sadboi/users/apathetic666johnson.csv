Advice,fq4w80m,t3_gge7uc,1589085678.0,"I’m boring as hell too! I only have three close friends and ones my girlfriend. Right now she’s watching The Man in The High Castle and I don’t find it interesting at all. Just before that she was watching some other popular show and I just couldn’t get into it. This has been how it has been for me and her our entire relationship. I’ve found out I just really enjoy specific things, they have to be exceptional, I’m finding out I’m too picky and maybe even a perfectionist. For me to care it has to move me and I’m a 500 ton weight. In fact, I have no idea what I *would* even like. For the first time in years I recently fell in love with a series a few months ago and I surprised myself because it was Star Trek New Generation, I had always been under the preconception that it was just not for me, and I even hated the first few episodes, then suddenly something clicked and I was hooked. Then we finished the series, and she moved on to a new show, and my alternate life within a tv program faded away as the next show just did not hold my interest or live up to what needed to come together to capture me. Most of the time I just spend time alone, like I mean I’m so boring I just go to another room away girlfriend for hours doing very introverted hobbies for hours rarely leaving the house. I’ve tried going on vacations and visiting new places but I’m just bored by it, except for tiny moments of fascination. I have depression, it really does suck joy out of life.

Anyway, I keep talking about my girlfriend because you mentioned you’d like to date but you don’t feel like you’re interesting to anyone. Trust me, I feel the same, I have no idea why anyone who considers me a friend sticks around but somehow they like me despite hardly even talking. there are people who find mild mannered people like us interesting, I still find it shocking but it’s real. What’s strange is it’s almost always extremely interesting and outgoing people who are drawn me, i think it’s because having a calm and even tempered person to listen to them is a change of pace for these people, and I really enjoy these extroverted people because they make my life less boring. I honestly don’t think I put much out there but my girlfriend will say “my friend really likes you!” And Ill just be perplexed, and thinking how?? Me? I’m boring as dried paint! But I guess everyone has their places, like us, we may be labeled “boring” and boring may be a mean and bad word so we may be hard on ourselves. We see extroverted people taking life by the horns and assume we must have to be like them to enjoy life. I thought that for a long time but I disagree now. We represent something just as important about enjoying a side of life even though it may be labeled as boring by the thrill seekers, and I think there is nothing wrong with it. Embrace what you like if that includes not liking what other people like. Why do you need to like what other people like anyway? That’s denying who you really are. If you like something, you like it, it only becomes boring if you are actually bored by it. If you want to try to become more adventurous that is an absolutely achievable goal. Just create a list of things you’d like to try to do or even things you’d imagine might be fun. Maybe you do want to get into shows? Just try one episode of a show. Maybe go for a hike at a local park if you’ve been contemplating hiking? Plan for when you have free time and attempt to go try it. If you’re avoiding doing things caused  from anxiety try looking into exposure therapy. But ultimately if you’re happy with your life how it is but you feel like you’re not living it to the fullest, try to ask yourself what would make you feel satisfied to learn your future self accomplished. For me, I’d be excited to know future me got healthy and was capable of running a marathon and could on occasion be the life of the party. As a lazy introvert that gives me some direction to fly toward. This is a more helpful alternative to dwelling on everything you’re not, that way of thinking doesn’t help you grow and keeps you locked in place hating yourself, instead imagine what you could and would want to imagine becoming and start working toward it. But if you’re happy being boring like I am, you’ve got no reason to feel bad about it. You’ll find friends and partners if you just be yourself, you can be interesting while being “boring” to the right people. I’ve found enough of them to know they exist and more are out there! Just keep searching."

I’ve had a few therapists and a few of them never felt like we had a connection while two others were very helpful and made me feel comfortable. Every therapist has their own way of speaking and looking at and fixing problems. Medication is the same too, sometimes people have to try a few before they find one that works. Also, even talking to people about your problems can help a lot too. If you don’t have any friends to do that with r/anxiety is helpful! There’s also 7cups.com which is a free therapy site. They match you up with a listener and you can tell them everything that’s on your mind. 

Also, I’m a big fan of supplements and eating good food. The brain can become a mess if you’re not giving it the right nutrients. Try to eat less junk food and more fresh veggies and fruits. I have a problem with certain foods making my body inflamed and if I eat too many of these foods my body doesn’t like my entire mental health can take a plunge. There’s been a lot of success with magnesium as an anxiety and depression supplement. I’m a big fan of l-theanine, it’s actually found in green tea, it makes me sleep well and makes my dreams more vivid.

I know this may be uncomfortable or unpopular, but seeing a therapist to talk about your problems can help. Once you talk to a professional about what’s going on in your head it can be very enlightening and help you grow out of your cage. Also, seeing a psychiatrist to get medication helps as well. I’ve been taking Lexapro for about 6 years off and on and it’s helped stabilize the worst parts of my anxiety and depression.

If you do decide to do this, be sure to not make the hand writing look like yours or use words the way you would, basically create a character to write your complaints through.

Also, when I was 16 my parents found out I smoked weed and took my door off and took all my electronics (among other things, like not letting me leave the house except for school untill I could pass a drug test, reading my journals, and arguing every night) . I thought I was the only one who ever had that happened. Sometimes about lack of privacy or something? It just made me angry though, I didn't learn anything except to keep secrets better lmao."
AskReddit,flc6xi7,t3_fnszg7,1585021506.0,"I had been following it since late January, and according to my Amazon purchase, the day I got serious was Feb 11. I bought a gas mask, a biohazard suit and a case of gloves. I'm too embarrassed to wear my gas mask in public yet and the biohazard suit was clearly just crazy for me to buy, only 10 dollar though. I've been wearing my glove daily to work. I'll probably wear my gas mask if I end up having to go to a store, which I'm not planning on doing at all until this is all over. I'm really lucky I have a bidet and a small appetite."

No one believes this is real. I wish I could show everyone in this city the videos of Italian hospitals. They’d take it seriously then.

CoronavirusUS,fkuv1d8,t1_fkuuu8c,1584556665.0,"I can’t wrap my head around why they keep telling us to avoid wearing masks if it can be transmitted just from someone talking to you. From what I’ve read, they discourage mask use simply because you’ll be more likely to touch your face and that you’re better off to just wash your hands constantly. I say wear a mask, continue avoiding touching your face and wash your hands frequently."

AskReddit,fktanf8,t1_fktak39,1584511815.0,Well it would have been more useful before the toilet paper hoarders began their raids. Now it would just be a sad attempt to bank on their over supply. But mostly I thought it was too novel of an idea for anyone to care about. *But maybe one day we will have toilet paper chutes because of my hands*.
AskReddit,fktah0x,t3_fkks0o,1584511628.0,A few years ago I had this crazy idea for a rapid toilet paper storage dispenser. You could drop all the rolls into a chute you could have near your toilet and never have to worry about loading single rolls for a long time as once you finished one roll a new one would pop down. I had this unusual feeling it would make me millions if I developed it but i scrapped the idea. I am now incredibly disappointed I never created it.

But I noticed France had a high percentage of young people hospitalized and I’ve learned from watching traveling videos and talking to people who visited France that smoking is still very common there. They say everywhere you go young and old are smoking. Just a thought!
