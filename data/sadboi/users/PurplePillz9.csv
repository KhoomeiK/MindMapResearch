Now that you are back in her life you can definitely help her navigate trying to get into some of these programs as they typically require an address, phone number, etc. I definitely agree about getting her a prepaid phone so that at least you can contact her, a friend of mine uses AT&T‚Äôs prepaid plan and pays $15/month.

Another thing to consider from my experience is to determine what your end goal is now (work for state, want to do research/become PI, work for hospital etc), I noticed in my field of maternal and child health epidemiology that a lot of the people that worked in that field all had their PhD‚Äôs or MD‚Äôs- essentially it was known that if you wanted to continue maternal and child epi you couldn‚Äôt get by with just an MPH, you HAVE to go on and get your PhD to do any meaningful research or work, otherwise your basically just suck with being a project manager and looking after the grad students.
