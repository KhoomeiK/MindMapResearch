depression,ewhrgwt,t3_co4r6g,1565418839.0,"I experienced that for almost a whole year, every day, every second, like something is terribly wrong and i am constantly scared all the time. I used to feel every action, word and thought of mine was wrong and i am moving towards an impending doom. It was truly the worst. 
I did not take any medicine but rather revolted against it by intensely practising yoga. I only practised for 2weeks. And i slowly started regaining my feeling of ""ok it's all normal"". I do yoga every day now and it's truly helping me stay okay."
selfhelp,ettd58z,t3_cddsrj,1563173998.0,"Hey. Your only job now is to stop saying things thats self-derogatory. You cannot transform yourself into someone who you think is great, but you can discover the greatness that's already in you. If you dont feel anything about you is awesome(which So many people feel about themselves) you can start doing things that you think are awesome and you will naturally rediscover every nice things about you. Its like two sides of the same coin. Few lucky people naturally feel they are awesome and hence do things thats awesome. We can turn that around for our own advantage. You can do awesome things and you will start feeling that way. It's a loop. By awesome what i mean is something that you have always wanted to do that you know is going to make you a better person but you never started because you were crushed by negative thoughts.

Also, you are not really ""lonely"" lonely. The very feeling of loneliness is just some bad feeling inside you parading with fancy names. If you start feeling happy, that feeling will also parade with fancy names but it's all very positive and you start feeling really good too. 

So, work on happiness. Make it a number one priority. All good things follow happy people.

You can do yoga, which naturally expands the energy in your body and releases blocked energies which we call ""negative"" feelings. 

It's really hard to make the first move. But it's totally worth it."

relationship_advice,etloozj,t1_etldl8i,1562941839.0,"I really feel he should mend things now that i have expressed how badly i felt the other day. He only apologised and he feels somehow thats more than enough. I dont quite feel like he is feeling bad about this whole thing as much as i am. 
I am really confused if i am over reacting or he is being a lazy boyfriend."
relationship_advice,etlohc6,t1_etldl8i,1562941696.0,"I felt really bad when the guy in front of us arranged for a cake, which btw was on the house obviously, and my bf was really indifferent about. And he never gave me even a card on my birthday. I understand he was broke. I didnt expect anything fancy but i am pretty sure he was in a position to afford atleast a card. I felt really disrespected because he showed no discomfort in not giving me anything on my bday, a small candy would have sufficed seriously(it's the effort that really counts?) and also he was quite fine when the couple were celebrating in front of us. Am I being unreasonable here?"
relationship_advice,etlj2s0,t1_etlbmmw,1562937816.0,Thank you!!!
relationship_advice,etlj2fj,t1_etlbmmw,1562937809.0,Thank you!!!
relationship_advice,etlj0uw,t1_etlj0a1,1562937776.0,He never addressed the issue
relationship_advice,etlj0a1,t1_etlctvn,1562937764.0,No he seemed quite normal
relationship_advice,etliwxw,t1_etlfa8x,1562937693.0,No I am mad that he didn't feel bad at all when the couple next to us celebrated. If I was in his place I would have atleast tried arranging a cake for him in the restaurant after this incident because they give out free cakes if it's someone's birthday. I am only mad that he is least bothered to even think for a second that i would have felt bad when the girl next to me was celebrating right in front of me. He seemed quite normal. I cant imagine being like that if i was in his place!!
relationship_advice,etldeeq,t1_etlc7p0,1562932813.0, He told me that he was broke a few days before my bday. So i assumed he wouldnt be able to take me out. And I just wanted to go out with him on my bday. So it was more like my birthday treat !
relationship_advice,etlct29,t1_etlbgui,1562932196.0,I think because i am only expecting the bare minimum here.
relationship_advice,etlcbzs,t1_etlbsd1,1562931689.0,I really felt horrible! I still do
relationship_advice,etlc5v2,t1_etlbf41,1562931505.0,"I get that it's petty but its kind of a big deal for me and i really thought he would know that by now. Also, i felt it would have been really awkward for him if i disagreed with him when he said that the girl who celebrated in the restaurant must be feeling bad."
relationship_advice,etlbf5p,t1_etlbaiy,1562930660.0,Of course he wished me. He gave me a present two days after my bday.
relationship_advice,etlb8tz,t1_etlb6up,1562930456.0,Ummm i treated him!!
