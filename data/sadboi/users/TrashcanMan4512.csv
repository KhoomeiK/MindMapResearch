They were lucky enough to be born with seed money and realized they could either let it run out on cocaine and hookers, or let it be their employee and let it go fetch them more cocaine and hookers.

And besides which... are they risking ALL of that $10,000,000?  No.  If it starts going wrong on them they get out.  A full on total crash to zero only happens with penny stocks, at least so quickly that you can't get out.  So... what they lose a million 5?  Boohoo whatever I can't burn down 10 mil if I try.

For me it's becoming rapidly apparent that as a lone individual, I can use these skills to reduce my costs fairly dramatically within a stable social framework... and that's all.

So now the bet is... do you bet on a stable social framework or do you and a guild of similarly skilled individuals specialize and become a part of a mini-society?"

Yes.  We are.  That's precisely what we're going to do.  There is going to be no vaccine.  This is going to be like fusion.  Always right over the horizon (sure).

The people lack the patience for more lockdown.  The .gov won't do it because much longer of this shit and our economy is... well not ""toast"" but quite bad.

How many are collateral determines whether or not there is panic and that National Guard scenario.  You can call that ""not collapse"" if you want, I consider it to be such.

Yes on the other end you'll have a nice functioning happy little half baked pseudo military dictatorship with electricity and food but that's what you'll have if it gets that bad.

So.  Think.  What to do.

Option 1: bug out to nowhere and lose health care coverage.  This is a bet you won't get sick.  If you do you die.

Option 2: stick around keep the health care coverage and LIKELY get it within that three year span and MAYBE die.  Odds of winning?  Not sure.
