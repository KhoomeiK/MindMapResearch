unpopularopinion,fmidwxc,t3_fvhan3,1586107652.0,"Hi op! Professional dog trainer here and  sorry but I have to strongly disagree with you on this one. There are enough other proven ways to train your dog that a choker chain really does not need to be used at all, ever. Now depending on the size of your dog it is true that it can be used in a less harmful way but if you have a small dog such as a pug you can cause permanent damage to their trachea just by one quick tug. Why would you want to choke your dog? Especially when you could use a gentle leader(nose lead) plus a regular collar and get the same results without causing any harm to your dog. The only time I personally believe a choker chain should be used is on highly aggressive dogs who have not responded to any other forms of training. Even then I would try extremely hard with other methods before even reaching for the choke collar."

Also if it gets really bad, taking a quick shower and just rinsing down there helps a lot and you will feel more comfortable."
Anxiety,fmahq7z,t3_fu2xcf,1585894526.0,I mean this in just an honest way not trying to sound harsh but maybe your bf isn‚Äôt as concerned about you because HE is the one out there everyday and more likely to contract the virus than you who is at home all day. It must be hard for him right now so that might be why he‚Äôs so distant. It‚Äôs not to say that your problems aren‚Äôt as important but in this instant he just might not be able to help you because he can‚Äôt even help himself. These are hard/intense times. Try to talk it out and see where that leads before making any final decisions.

unpopularopinion,fiay4pd,t1_fiawp9f,1582310718.0,I think it depends on the person. Most people enjoy sex and need it in their relationship.

I‚Äôm just saying that theirs a chance op might need to make a compromise with their spouse if they are someone who enjoys/needs sex often.
