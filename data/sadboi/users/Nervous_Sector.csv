socialanxiety,fqed05g,t1_fqecow3,1589305529.0,Yes - the eye contact too!! Gah.

lululemon,f7fminq,t1_f7fjlqm,1573682627.0,Could be! I have only bought 1 pair of WunderUnders because I have also seen a lot of reviews on their site about them being see through. I feel like everyone says that so IDK!
lululemon,f7etctw,t3_dvdrkw,1573665372.0,"I had the same issue but the 6's fit me better and no butt crack worries. I have a couple of pairs that I have to pull up more than others. I lift weights in them and skate in them. I literally don't wear any other leggings. I did get a pair of the striped Wunderunders and you can totally see my crack in those, which sucks."
TwoXChromosomes,ez4vqn2,t1_ez1thy6,1567692776.0,Not to freak you out but just be aware of your surroundings anyway - a piece of paper doesn't always keep the stalkers away. My stalker broke the injunction 4 days later...went to jail for a month with no bond. Then the felony was dropped because he is mentally incompetent. Sucks. I hope you don't have to worry about him anymore though! People are fucking nuts.
TwoXChromosomes,ez4vizt,t3_cztlpn,1567692684.0,I know how scary and stressful that can be. I had to do the same thing last year. :( I hope he leaves you alone now!!

hotones,esi8o69,t3_c7ssyg,1562008930.0,I received a regular order after 2 weeks (got it today) but I've been waiting a month and a half for the subscription box. Is that normal or a one-off?

Sorry you are going through this :("
AskReddit,erpq3zw,t3_c332rq,1561125216.0,"I have a mentally incompetent stalker. After two years, I finally was able to win an injunction against him and 4 days later he showed up where I work (again). He went to jail for a bit, but I still worry about it every day. Clearly the injunction means nothing. Felony charges were dropped too. I am paranoid about posting anything public about my life on the internet. It sucks."
