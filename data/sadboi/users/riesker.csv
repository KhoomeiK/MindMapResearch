It makes no sense coming on here asking advice form happy people. Their suggestions are for themselves so rhat they can feel better. not you! when u are alone and depressed and feeling worthless nobody is there to help you. So be selfish, do what makes you happen even though you feel like killing yourself. People get over death within a month or a year. But depression lasts a lifetime and thats the most hurtful part, dying everyday and noone can see it"

Every time the US wanna steal assets there is suddenly a virus going around killing people by the hundreds and thousands and then when  the dust settles and the virus magically disappears and is never heard of again, where is Ebola today?!"

Please do enlighten me because im under the impression that you‚Äôre thinking that if u get a tetanus shot you‚Äôre basically immune to every bacteria , germ and virus . And they‚Äôre not lies just opposing theories and just because u dont agree doesnt mean its wrong again , its someone personal medical preference"

rickandmorty,f8d2p4p,t1_f8clb4o,1574476501.0,"Yes, but it‚Äôs highly unlikely for someone to get tetanus, when last did you hear about a tetanus epidemic and if you get tetanus, just like a normal virul illness it can be treated and then preventative measure can be put into place to avoid it again. You cant tell me I need to make myself sick in order to not get sick just in case i might get sick. You‚Äôre exposing your body to cancer causing chemicals and putting your body in over drive trying to fight disease in your body.

People who take vaccines act like they make u invincible to all the germs and viruses in the world, you‚Äôre forgetting there are only vaccines for some virus, like polio, h1n1 , etc if you take these vaccines you can still get the common cold, strep throat, fever, headaches and other medical conditions and communicable diseases that there arent any vaccines for. Your argument and stance on vaccination is based on fear and personal preference. 

Just because scientists spend most of the time researching information to prove their theories dont mean that the opposing view of their theories is incorrect especially when opposing views contradict what they want people to believe so that they can keep making money."
rickandmorty,f8c65xv,t3_dzzgfa,1574453353.0,"Exactly, what I've been saying the government and scientists keep these viruses in vials in a lab and spread them to the population ever so often.

linguisticshumor,f748puj,t1_f71v87c,1573399353.0,"Yes there is . You have to remember Modern day English is a mix of old English and words of different origins combined to make one English word. Just because it is an ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù word doesn‚Äôt mean its an english derivation . Xylophone is a compound word. Let us look at the morphemes Xylo and Phone . Xylo which means of wood or related to wood which has a Greek Origin i.e. Xulon which means wood, and phone  which in linguistics we know that means sound ( not short for telephone in this case). So essentially  you have ‚Äúwodden sound‚Äù which is what the instrument is.  Now you can see why Xylophone is spelt with an X due to the origin of the word and not the actual sound, however, it is transcribed with a /z/ which is the actual sound that we hear when we say the word. 

Ps. For explanation purposes i skipped out saying that ‚Äúphone‚Äù is also of greek origin in this case. It‚Äôs strange that the instrument has origins from Southeast Asia and Africa but the word for the instrument is Greek."
