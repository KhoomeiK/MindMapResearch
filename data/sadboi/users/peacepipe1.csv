A friendship vs this relationship.   This sort of speaks to the point of my question, that society puts such an emphasis on sex that without it there is not love.  Women so often say “I want a man who loves me for me, not just sex” yet you never hear them say “I don’t value a man that doesn’t want me for sex and only values me for me”. It’s nature I understand but still frustrating for someone unnatural, like me.

Her love language is extremely affectionate and extremely horny.   She has told me though she would be ok with it.  But again my ‘condition’ translates to her and all other girls as rejection, no matter how open is my disclosure.

I see this in scripture both in the nee and Old testament.

Modern Christianity does not see it this way, churches and Christians all seem to lean heavily towards god not being a provider or source of positive outcomes here on earth.  I understand god isn’t responsible for our happiness or following him will ensure it, but I think the idea that he doesn’t provide earthly benefits is a modern interpretation of scripture, and frankly I don’t agree with that interpretation.

AskWomen,ezrnxqt,t1_ez4gthn,1568076459.0,"if a species is successful enough to deplete the resources of a planet (which I believe we are unimaginable far from doing) that is neither good or bad, that is nature, the same thing you say is being raped by the process.

All living things displace the earth to make room for themselves and to survive.

And pollution kills people, not the earth.  pollution is like a fart in the wind compared to the earths atmosphere, or it's water supply.  the only negative effect from pollution we deem bad for the planet, isn't and is in fact only bad for humans and a micro (vs macro) level - (poor air quality, contaminated drinking water etc).  Pollution harms humans, but is like drop of water on hot cement to the earth.  The earth doesn't care about us, has been here for billions of years before, will be here for billions of years after.  The earth has survived far great climate disruptions than our simple wastes."

misanthropy,ezlxly9,t1_ezi08o0,1567983125.0,Glad to see you and others agree and can see this. And yeah being an introvert myself I get constant cheap shots from every direction.  It’s so annoying and also as an introvert difficult to defend against.

misanthropy,ezjwd3b,t1_ezcule3,1567951339.0,"It’s pretty sick, and I also think women feel a certain sense of satisfaction in rejecting someone who’s good looking kind of like they’re impressed with themselves for doing so, and feel better than what they subconsciously and irrationally believe is some sort of ideal. 

The best is going to the gym.  I walk in and every guy puffs their chest out and gives me tough looks, starts talking to their friends really loud while staring at me.  Or walking through the mall, a guy with his girlfriend will see me puff his chest out, grab her hand, start talking to her while staring at me, defending her from me.  She’s on her phone bro, she’s not paying attention to either one of us.  what do you think I’m going to do?  Step in front of the two of you and ask her out on a date?  Or at the beach girls on their cell phones checking their Facebook and their boyfriends intently watching me, if I sit up to look around, their heads turn immediately to me checking my gaze.  Mind your business, go fuck yourself.  If I was more outgoing I would fuck with these bristled up guys, and any time I saw this ridiculous responsive posturing I’d immediately approach the couple and somehow charismatically engage just to pour gasoline on this annoying defensive jealous response, to give this idiot guys some push back."

Isolate a monkey and it gets fucked up.  Aside from the arguable ethics of the experiments I think if you’re going to invest time in research, there are more useful questions to pursue"

sociopath,ezex39k,t1_ezet2an,1567869957.0,"It just made me extremely sad and I couldn’t stop thinking about it for days.  Thinking about the monkeys held in small boxes with no stimulus for up to 2 years and how fucked up they became.  How they then released them into a room full of other normal monkeys and they were terrified and bullied mercilessly.   How the monkeys fought to get out of the cages for a week or so then gave up.   The suffering of being locked in a box unable to move too much, isolated, no stimulus for such a long period of time, the monkeys came out “extremely disturbed”.  It’s just fucked up and if that psychologist were still alive I’d take a bat to his fucking head, just enough to knock him out, then put him in what he referred to as a “pit of despair” and leave him there for a couple years, as an experiment, and see how he turned out.

I don’t judge those who don’t have empathy, I’m not a big fan of empathy, I don’t see any Darwinian function  to it.  just putting this out there as I think it’s a good test to see if you have empathy."
misanthropy,ezcstxq,t1_ezcqc3w,1567839976.0,"Lol.  Know what you mean.  I’m in that echelon too where I get the attention with not having to try, and the guys that do “try”, the “try” includes little attention to the woman, and an obsession with emasculating and tearing me down.  Bullshit and videos like this I see as part of it, painting “pretty” as “bad”. 

Nice to meet you dude.  And you can’t complain about the negative attention, can you?   Dare not to say you’re a good looking man, regardless of the fact that women aren’t attracted to physical appearance ... a black man can identity as such and also identify racial stigma and unfair hate he feels from his skin, but we can’t.

It’s so pervasive.  How often do I / anyone get down voted on reddit?   Never.  Except in my posts on this thread, pointing out this video is correlating pretty with evil.  Downvote because people like saying pretty = evil."

I’m jus trying to mind my business and  get along with people and guys around me switch from friend to enemy the second a girl gives me attention.  I don’t want her and I don’t want to be part of the conversation.  Ask her out on a date, leave me out of it."
