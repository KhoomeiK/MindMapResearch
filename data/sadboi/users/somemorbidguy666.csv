I've had about 2-3 months of nothing but being alone basically. I understand it was a time to heal, but I haven't done anything fun this summer to help heal. So the first month was basically me think about her all the time in bed. Having nothing to do, keeps you mind on them, so it hasn't been good for me recently. I have a question tho, you say you can't accept that she cheated because if you did it would make it worse, why is that? Acceptance is one of the beginning stages of grief. I understand not wanting for her to leave, but she made her decision; I would just accept it because it helps you a lot more. The damage has already been done, so even if you get back together, it wont be the same anymore. Sorry if I sounded like a dick, but I understand what your going through and I think i give good advice."

For me I dated this girl for about 2 months and I loved her(I thought she felt the same, but nope) she cheated on me... I felt broken and that my trust was betrayed. The first month is complete shit, the second month can be bad as well, the 3rd month is when you start truly moving on, 4th month and you can think about her without feeling like shit. It's been about 4 months and I started feeling rly good this 4th month but something just happened(yesterday) that doesn't involve me ex and I feel like shit again :)

Some tips for you to help feel better
1. Block her on social media!!! It helps you sooo much
2. Dont talk to her at all, it's like picking at an old wound
3. Start doing something productive like working out(its helped me a bit)
4. DON'T DATE ANYONE until you find yourself. This sounds like sound spiritual shit, but it helps you from not getting hurt so soon. I made the mistake and hoped that dating someone else will help me find myself, I ended up getting hurt again"

SuicideWatch,esiyb4w,t3_c7tgzu,1562022547.0,"It's got a lot to do with the selfishness of the people around them. I'm currently going to a psychologist and on the first meeting he asked me this question, ""do you want me to help you live, or help you die?"" When we first meet I actually wanted to continue living. The question actually messed me up because I wanted to know if anyone said they wanted help dying. I now know that if I were asked the question now, that I would also answer I wanted help to die. I dont fear death, but I fear the consequences of my actions that the people who care about me will have to deal with. I should say that I haven't had a long life; I'm still legally a minor actually, but I don't know life doesn't interest me anymore. To tell you the truth I'm only living for 3 reasons right now; the first one is my dog(I couldn't bear being without him), the second is I want to try psychedelics(LSD, shrooms, etc) and the third is the financial and emotional burden I would put on my family. I don't think I'll get better, at least I don't see getting better anytime soon. I'm going to be going through psychologists and psych hospital for the next couple years, so maybe I will find a reason to live. If we are allowed to decide when our life should end, there should be an age requirement. I'm saying that because young people make rash decisions. I have decided that I'm killing myself when I'm 65 though, no matter what's happening in my life. I'll be 65 on 4-20-69 and that's when I want to die. Anyway I want you to live on for a couple more years just to see if your life changes in a positive way, I'm giving that challenge to myself. Try and seek out therapy, because it does help quite a bit. If you still want to die, pick a date that's far in the future(like 4-20-69), maybe by then you will enjoy life. I hope you get better mentally, and I want you to do that there are people in similar circumstances as yourself."

I know you said that therapy is currently out of your budget, but try and save some money for it. I'm guessing me just wanting to disappear will gradually fade away, but I know that it will take time. I'm also meeting with a psychiatrist later this week, so that they could determine if I need antidepressants(I'm hoping I dont, but i have a feeling that i will be prescribed them) good luck with getting past your suicidal ideation, you're not the only person going through it, I am too and I'm sure plenty of other people are."

Personally I already regret telling him, and I hope he acts like everything is fine. I don't know the circumstances behind why she did it, but tell her that in a few years whatever is bothering her now will be insignificant.
