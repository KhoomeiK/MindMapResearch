I refuse to try antipsychotics unless it's a last resort or unless there is an emergency situation. I'm bipolar II, though. If you do experience psychosis and delusions during mania (or depression) antipsychotics may be a good idea, and it's possible Abilify just isn't the right one for you. It's also possible that you don't do well on an SSRI. Some people (like me) are fine as long as there is a mood stabilizer. If I take an SSRI without a mood stabilizer, I feel crazy. Some people report still having issues with SSRI's even with mood stabilizers, so that's another thing to talk about. 

When I got diagnosed a few months ago, my psychiatrist gave me a choice of three medications as first line treatments for Bipolar disorder -- Lamotrigine, Sodium Valproate, and Lithium. I chose the lamotrigine and so far it has been a miracle for me. Like all meds, it doesn't work for everyone. But, I would talk to my psychiatrist about a mood stabilizer like one of the three I mentioned above. Lithium is still the gold standard for bipolar.

If he hasn't seen a psychiatrist, I would have him see one. Even if it isn't bipolar, he would benefit from it. If he's tried meds before it might not have been the right meds.

As for the antidepressant, I was originally put on it by my GP before I saw a psychiatrist. She thought I had unipolar depression. I went hypomanic and went to the ER and that's when they first suspected bipolar. But, my GP said I wasn't bipolar and put me back on the citalopram AND upped it to 30mg. I ended up mixed and all over the place and self harmed. I finally got an emergency referral to see my psychiatrist. He brought my citalopram down to 20mg and said that he'd like me to stay on it because it's good for anxiety and that with the lamotrigine it shouldn't cause anymore mixed states. I was honestly fine for about three months on this combination (100mg and 20mg citalopram). Then I had that mixed episode. It didn't last as long as they previously did before the lamotrigine. Now that I'm up to 150mg of lamotrigine, I feel much more stable. 

I'm definitely going to let him know that I'm uncomfortable with antipsychotics and that, if I need zyprexa, I'd like to only use it a night or two and not for two weeks."

It seems like such a heavy antipsychotic and I'm not sure why he didn't temporarily prescribe something ""lighter"" like abilify. He did work with me on finding a good mood stabilizer which is how I ended up choosing lamotrigine. I'm not sure why he didn't give me options when I called the other day.

You thought it was over with. You had finally gotten the correct diagnosis. You'd gotten the correct prescription. The first time you marched up to the pharmacy with that script in your hand, you felt confident that you would finally be normal. That night, you held those two little white pills in your palm. You felt the future slip down your throat. Stability. Gone would be the days when your head contained nothing more than a thick knot of cotton. Gone would be the days when your mood soared so high that the world existed in a kaleidoscope of colour, and everything seemed possible. You felt like a genius on those days. You felt like an unstoppable force. That is, until you would inevitably come crashing to the ground in a pile of ash.

For awhile, those little white miracles worked. You swallowed them every night and woke up the next morning feeling normal. Your head was quiet. One thought at a time. No knots of cotton. No meteors. For awhile you became so comfortable that you almost forgot that the mind is a complex thing. Nothing is forever.

Now cobwebs have once again weaved themselves into the fabric of your mind. It's hard to think. It's almost impossible to move. Your chest burns beneath the weight of your own emptiness. A ""low mood"" isn't a strong enough description. No. You're already buried beneath six feet of sand, and mud, and shit. But, MoonMilk4, view it as a process. You'll find the right medication. You'll find the right dose. You won't always feel like this. Those cobwebs will be brushed aside and light will once again enter your mind. Just sit tight. Breathe. Breathe through the pain of shattered expectations. You'll come out the other side whole. I promise."

AmItheAsshole,fpdbztl,t1_fpbvhyj,1588523998.0,"Who cares? I am comfortable. 

Job satisfaction is important. Yes, I may make more as an attorney (although the job market is saturated with attorneys and it is difficult to find a high-paying position). I'd also be miserable as an attorney. I may make more as a cardiothoracic surgeon, but the long hours and the draining nature of the work would leave me dissatisfied. Money isn't everything. If your child wants to go into a humanities degree and this leads to a career in which he feels happy, fulfilled, and can provide for himself, who are you to say that's not good enough? 

Your standards are not his standards. You value wealth. He may value other things. Loosen the reigns.

Also, don't presume you know anything about my current work conditions. My ceiling is well over 100K and that's more than enough to live well in my area."

BipolarReddit,fp650n3,t1_fp5v77k,1588346189.0,"Can I ask about this? I asked about it on Bipolar facebook groups but everyone just told me I was smoking weed in the wrong headspace and that I needed to try different strains, LOL.

I used to enjoy smoking in my early 20's but then when I started to have worsening symptoms of Bipolar II everything went to shit (I was undiagnosed at the time). It became kind of a gamble as to whether I'd have a good high or a bad one. The bad ones were REALLY bad too. For instance, one time I was convinced I was the worst person in the world and needed to kill myself to make the world a better place. I actually said to my spouse, ""I'm a worse person than Hitler"". I cried on the bathroom floor for hours and then felt dissociated for days afterwards. Still, I had good highs every now and then so I just smoked in moderation and VERY small amounts.

Now that I'm on lamotrigine, every high is bad and I become convinced of all these things like that my spouse is miserable and wants to leave, that I'm the worst person to have ever existed, that I'm a failure, etc. I completely freak out. The next day I have these weird mini-depressive episodes. I've decided it's not worth it and I've quit smoking completely. It hasn't been a huge adjustment because I wasn't smoking every day.

Is there a specific contraindication between lamotrigine and marijuana or bipolar disorder and marijuana? Almost everyone on the Bipolar groups sings its praises but, I dunno, I just don't see how it's beneficial."
BipolarReddit,fp64ez1,t3_gbesha,1588345874.0,"It's the first medication I tried (added it to my 10mg of lamotrigine) when I was diagnosed a bit over two months ago. So far, it has been a miracle worker. I'll outline the benefits I've notice and the side effects I've noticed. Keep in mind that the titration is SUPER slow. There's a risk of a possibly fatal rash but the risk is quite small (0.04% or something) when the doses are properly titrated. I started at 25mg and went up by another 25mg every two weeks until I hit my target dose of 100mg. I have hypomania (not full mania) and so far, the lamotrigine has done a good job of making it less frequent and a lot milder and easier to control. It also doesn't last as long as it used to. My real big problem was depressive episodes, so the lamotrigine was a great fit for me. Keep in mind that my experiences may differ from yours. Everyone reacts differently. :)   


**Pros**

\- No depressive episodes since starting and only one VERY mild hypomanic episode when I finally tapered up to 100mg. It happened during the first two days of my target dose and then went away. Because the hypomania has decreased significantly, I'm better able to save money. 

\- My anxiety has always been very crippling and accompanied by panic attacks. Doctors thought I had an anxiety disorder. Since starting my lamotrigine I haven't had a single panic attack. This is BIG, because I used to have them most days (2+ times per day). My psychiatrist thinks that my anxiety was possibly part of my bipolar type II and not a separate diagnosis. It was weird getting used to waking up and NOT being anxious. 

\- My severe irritability has been drastically reduced. I used to flip out at the smallest things like someone asking me a question. I would say it has been reduced by 85%. I still feel irritable sometimes but it's not every day and when it does happen, I'm better able to think through it and control it.

\- My racing thoughts are completely gone. I used to be unable to hold onto one thought because my mind was always a jumbled mess of layered thoughts. As such, I'm better able to concentrate on my work, create, and express myself orally and in writing. 

\- Some people report word finding difficulties and issues with fuzzy memory on lamotrigine. I haven't experienced this at all. I would say I've experienced the opposite as I find I'm better able to communicate and retain information now. My psychiatrist said this is likely dose dependent and since I'm on a lower dose, it shouldn't be a big issue for me. If we end up titrating up in the future, we will keep an eye on my cognitive functioning.   


&#x200B;

**Cons** 

\- The titration process is annoyingly slow. I felt a small difference right away on 25mg because I'm super sensitive to medication. However, a lot of people only feel a difference as they approach therapeutic doses. 

\- Lamotrigine is weird because I reacted differently to each stage of titration. At 25mg I felt my anxiety dissipate and I felt calm and a tiny bit sedated in the morning. At 50mg I felt irritable. At 75mg I felt internal irritability but I was also calm so I didn't really express it. About a week into 100mg I felt stable and normal. So, it's really hard to tell if the medication will work well for you until you hit the target dose your psychiatrist wants you at. At least, that has been my experience. 

\- When I finally titrated up to 100mg, as previously stated, I had a bit of hypomania. I think this was brought about because I had a hard time sleeping two nights in a row. This is a common thing, as far as I know. Lamotrigine seems to be activating for some and sedating for others. I split my dose to 50mg at night and 50mg in the morning. Now that my body has adjusted, I don't feel sedated and I don't have a hard time sleeping. 

\- I'm not sure whether you're male or female, so this may not apply. I've noticed heavier periods and cramping since starting lamotrigine. I also get a few more pimples around that time of the month. It's nothing crazy, just 4-5 pimples rather than 1-2 and they go away once my period is done. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**A few more things to keep in mind;** 

\- If you miss multiple doses, or quit taking the medication, you need to go back to the 25mg starting dose and start the titration process over again. Make sure to stay on the medication if it works for you!

\- If you also take sodium valproate (I believe), you need to titrate even slower than normal. 

\- You CAN get a benign rash on lamotrigine (10% risk). It isn't life threatening. Because it's difficult to distinguish the benign rash from the SJS rash, most doctors recommend you cease taking the medication, call them, and go to the ER if there is any rash. If the rash is not serious, there is the option of waiting for it to clear and re-challenging the lamotrigine later with a slower titration schedule. I didn't have a rash problem but it's important to consider. One key difference between the benign rash and the SJS rash is that SJS will likely involved mucus membranes (ulcers and rash in the mouth, eyes, vagina, rectum, etc) and is sometimes accompanied by flu-like symptoms. 

\- I take lamotrigine with food (small snack at night and breakfast in the morning) and PLENTY of water (the pills taste bitter if you let them dissolve on your tongue). I don't think the food is necessary, but I have a sensitive stomach. 

\- I had to quit drinking alcohol on lamotrigine because I get unreasonably drunk off 1-2 small glasses of wine and then I'm severely depressed the next day - two days. That is also something to consider. Some drink in moderation on lamotrigine, but some can't.
