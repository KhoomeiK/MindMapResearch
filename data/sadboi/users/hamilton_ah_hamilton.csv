AskReddit,fit4k3w,t3_f9kd1v,1582704159.0,"There was this one time I was swimming in a pool, and I’m already not too good of a swimmer. So, I was swimming and my dumbass brother decides to ‘prank’ me by holding my head under the water, I was thrashing and screaming under the water, and I was clawing at his hand to let me go. Eventually, I started to feel dizzy and he finally let me go. I just sat on the stairs of the pool, crying and coughing up a storm, while trying to regain my breath. My head was pounding. I legitimately thought I would die when he held my head under. Mind you, this was when I was seven or eight. :/ I still can’t swim well.

Another time, I was in the midst of a traumatic event (trigger warning for this part) and I started to have a really bad panic attack; screaming, crying, shaking, hyperventilating, the whole shazam. So, this was all happening while I was locked in a room. For some odd reason, my brain told me that I would be trapped in the room for the rest of my life and I would die that way. I panicked and grabbed my rope out of my backpack, and nearly ended up tying a noose and hanging myself while panicking. I then got a sudden hold on myself and saw what I was doing, so I screamed and threw the rope. At that moment, the thoughts in my head felt like the most real thing in the world, and I genuinely felt that I wouldn’t make it out of that house alive.

This other time, I was in a Ferris wheel. I remember it was at Disneyland, California Adventure. We were in the rocking cars, and I did not have a good time. As we rose higher and higher, I got really scared and started to panic. My brother and my cousin were in the car. Across in the same car were two other strangers. I panicked while we went up and I was clinging to my brothers arm, and whenever the car rocked I think I screamed. I felt like if the car rocked too much or if I moved too much, we’d all die. Whenever my brother or someone moved, I’d scream that they’re gonna make us fall.

I dunno, I was just a child who was scared of death. I was an overly anxious, terrified of the world, shy, loud little child. I was scared of everything, prolly even my own shadow."

I’m sorry, I know you love him and it’s gonna be hard (oh trust, I know this situation all too well sadly), but I think he isn’t meant for you.

ftm,fb72u5j,t1_fb5wtsb,1576570966.0,"I just recently realized too! I'm in almost the same boat on the whole name thing too, people didn't really take me seriously when I tried changing my name. I'm currently trying out a new name, Charlie, and seeing if that one fits. I'll find out soon enough. :) Thanks for the advice."

ftm,fayhwn5,t1_faydco3,1576400972.0,"That's prolly what I'm gonna do! I know for sure that I'm not going to legally change my name until I know for sure what I want it to be. Sadly, there's always gonna be a handful of assholes who aren't gonna respect you or your name. I guess that's just something our whole community has learned to live with. I'm glad he had people who caught on though! I just hope people are like that at my school. Thanks for the story. :D"
ftm,fayh9tx,t1_faxlhy7,1576400687.0,"Thank you. I think my main support system is some of my friends, so I think they'd understand if I told them that I'm trying new names. Also, to the people who still dead name me, some of them do it on purpose. I have one who does it 100% on purpose. She's also homophobic, so I'm trying to find a way to get rid of her. She dead names me and when I correct her, all she says is ""whatever"". I confronted her about it and she says that she ""is still getting used to it"" and she's still gonna slip up. I have other friends who still dead name me, and some of them are getting better, some of them really don't care. I try to stay away from the ones that dead name me a lot. Also, thank you for the advice (and the essay)! :)"
ftm,fayfzlg,t1_faxhemc,1576400104.0,"Honestly, my dead name is a big cause of dysphoria too. I hate it. I've hated it since a young age, and I've always wanted a different name. People made puns out of it all the time, would call me a hippy (my deadname sounds like something a hippy would say), and people just always made fun of my name. I hated it, and it seems other people hated it too. Only my parents seem to like it. I can relate on the part about finding the 'right' name, names are really hard! Also, I read your post. I think your name is very nice. :) It sucks that your family doesn't think so, but remember that it's your choice, not theirs. You're living with your name, they aren't. If you like your name, you should go with it. If not, that's fine too! Hopefully, one day we can both have or names settled lol. Thank you for your advice. :D"
ftm,fayev3y,t1_fawzwmu,1576399610.0,"I haven't gotten it legally changed yet, mostly because I'm a minor and my parents kinda think that me wanting to change my name is me 'throwing away their gift' (to them, names are gifts, which they are, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have to accept it and live with it.) I'm hoping to legally change my name when I turn 18 though. Thank you for the advice! :)"

ftm,fayedul,t1_fawh2g6,1576399392.0,"It's pretty tough because I know lots of people who still call me by my dead name even when I correct them, usually saying that they forgot. I'm just worried that if I change it again, they're just gonna fully give up and just leave. I do like the idea of using the name with myself first, that sounds pretty smart. I think I'll try that before I settle on any new names. Thank you for the advice. :D"
Advice,fanb1d0,t1_fanam7k,1576232550.0,"It isn't a 'fad' or a 'trend'. Maybe more people are coming out now because they're actually being accepted now more than ever. Yeah, there's the occasional group of trenders who do it for the attention and just want everyone to look at them, but majority of the people who are trans now aren't doing it to 'be different'. I don't really think there's anything fun about being different, and I don't think there's many other people who would think so either. Most of the people who are trans would probably prefer to be cis if they were given the choice. No one wants to have to feel out of place."
Advice,fana8xg,t1_fan9rsv,1576231410.0,"Actually, non-binary (another term for genderqueer) has been around since the early 1900s. It's known as a lack of gender or a third gender (pretty contradicting names if you ask me :/), and it's been around since ancient times. Some of the ancient Egyptian rulers were the third gender (one pretty well known one is Hatshepsut)! Just wanted to share this info, it's okay if you don't really go by it or anything. As long as you don't shit on enby people or anything then it's cool."
PublicFreakout,faiu5mh,t3_e9czuq,1576116679.0,Guy reminds me of my asshole boomer grandfather 💀💀 Sounds exactly like him too. Even does the thing where they don't let you talk and they call you a bitch while talking over you extremely loudly (don't forget their face being in your face). Don't forget their ugly ass finger about to jab your eye ball! Even the stutter is there lmao. I hate these types of old people. Hope this guy gets a slow driver in front of him!
