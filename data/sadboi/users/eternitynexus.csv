I just want to take this opportunity to present a friendly reminder to take care of your mental health as well. The most important thing right now is to remember to take care of yourself. Yes, everything mentioned in the comment above is good to think about, but please make sure to refrain from obsessing over things you can't control. Remember to prioritize yourself and to tell yourself that we'll get through this. I promise, it really does help.

Okay, so it doesn’t necessarily need to be drone strikes, but you do admit that we needed to respond. 

> We've spent countless billions on wars in the middle east long after Al Qaeda was defeated, 

Al Queda only lost their strength relatively recently. The majority of the US’s time in the Middle East since 2001, they’ve been a legitimate threat.

> And as for specifically why 9/11 hasn't happened again, that probably has a lot more to do with ramped up airport and border security than with our largely counterproductive involvement in the middle east.

Very few, if any, terrorist attacks can be shown to have been prevented by airport security. If a terrorist is deterred from planning or carrying out an attack, there’s simply no way to prove it.

> how are they the terrorists when we're the ones starting pointless wars in foreign nations and drone-striking civilian buildings

Please point out to me when the US purposely attacked civilian targets. If you’re talking about collateral damage or unintended casualties, that is completely different than when Al Queda purposely flew planes into two buildings full of civilians."
