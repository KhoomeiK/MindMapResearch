So they literally showed up and basically tried to bully and intimidate workers into handing them over. Maybe stop giving people reasons to not give a rats ass about you (as much as that may have just been heated words during a literal standoff).

I'm glad it's closed, couldn't possibly control the crowds on boats and at the ports.

Could also read ""I've Got a Time Bomb,"" by Sybil Lamb which is probably the weirdest book I've ever read. Well, comparably weird than Kathy Acker's ""Pussy, King of the Pirates,"" which obviously inspired quite a bit of the style and is also some of the most bizarre queer writing I've ever read and would recommend. Please acknowledge that these are pretty sexually explicit and very transgressive. I don't think of them as depressing, but I also tend to not get too phased by that sort of thing...

For 'lighter' fare, check out the Transcendant series of sci fi anthologies."
