FUCKYOUINPARTICULAR,fow5np5,t1_fovyqfy,1588113469.0,"EM fields have to be mighty strong to affect electricity in atmosphere. The bigger consideration, as far as lightning is concerned, is the density and moisture of the air between clouds and ground. It finds the least resistant, path close to a mile or air it has to move through (which is much harder than human, foot for foot), and if you happen to be anywhere near the bottom of that, you're likely to be less resistant than the air next to you, for example, because you're all squishy and watery so if you can save it approximately 6 feet of air travel, it's likely it will give up dozens of feet of its otherwise intended path to move to your body. It may sound implausible, but the realistic answer is some people apparently are just in the wrong place at the wrong time repeatedly. It's always worth looking for hidden causes, but the effects you're describing are well-known to science and aren't as influential as you would think, just like the human who gets struck is largely uninfluential to the fact that lightning decided to hit their immediate vicinity in the first place. 
On a side note, because I am curious, what are you referring to when you say ""people's EM fields?"" We generate photons in the IR spectrum via body heat, but is there something else you're talking about?"

unpopularopinion,fn7ahrq,t3_fzud2f,1586716485.0,"I agree, mostly. Except the part about the repeat offender drug dealer being ""proven"" incapable of or uninterested in rehabbing. Our current prison system, here in the US where the industry is privatized, is well- known to turn small- time dealers into both repeat offenders, and hardened criminals, by stripping them of almost all work opportunities on the outside and providing them hundreds of criminal contacts by keeping them in prison along with people who were part of a multi-tier drug enterprise that will hire them and feed their kids after a conviction. Makes it impossible to tell statistically whether or not someone is capable of rehabilitating, because it not only doesn't present, but actively obfuscates, the option to do so.

I'm not getting conspiratorial here, but the system works best this way from the viewpoint of the number-crunchers at the top of privatized prison systems. They don't even need (in terms of their own success as finance moguls) to know why their numbers look so damn good, all they need to know is, following policy and structure changes x, y, and z, they now keep their cells fuller and more income rolling. For that reason, private prisons in particular will never, ever, ever be inclined to truly rehabilitate their inmates."

And even after the Coronavirus news, it's blowing me away how few people changed those habits in the least. A quarantine is literally the only thing that will stop this thing spreading because people just can't be bothered to show even a shred of reticence of their own actions while they're in public. I got directly coughed on by a lady in the produce section while on a grocery run last week, well-after it was known to be in my area. Felt her breath directly on my face. We're our own biggest health hazard, because in an age where we have the technology to prevent absolutely any spreading besides airborne, nobody gives a fuck if they get a stranger sick.

It is moving pretty fast, drops pretty slowly, and so does disperse the water quite a bit as it drops it (Still looks like it hurts). This one looked more like a wall of thick, fast-moving mist. The principle I was talking about applies a lot more to smaller or slower planes, or to helicopters with dump buckets. I lived in forest fire country for a lot of my life and went to check out some spots where I'd seen them used, and those suckers can leave holes... I mean, large truck sized holes, in the dirt, and can break trees off at the stump. They were all dumping from a little higher altitude as well (not ""high altitude"" per se, just higher than this one) so the intense heat from way bigger fires than this wouldn't wreck their rigs. They would dump it so that it ends up with a laminar flow that's a couple human heights wide, so it's a lot more brutal and sticks together for a lot longer. Probably using some anti-dispersal (foam? or solution?) as well. They would sometimes break up a little before they hit the ground, but the chunks they'd break into were definitely big and heavy and still moving fast by the time they landed. With the wildfires that happened around my place, if the water broke up much, the fire would evaporate a lot of it before it had touched anything, so they had to do it that way. I suppose they didn't have planes like this one, not sure if that'd be necessary at this size."
Whatcouldgowrong,fkgovv3,t1_fkgnkw0,1584167539.0,"It's because of the sheer amount of water and the speed at which they dump it. if you run a showerhead and pass over something at 300mph, it will drop small droplets on whatever it passes. But this isn't worth the time and fuel it takes to collect water in terms of fighting wildfires. Instead, they design the dump hatches to drop it as more of a ""ball"" of thousands of gallons, so it takes significantly longer to break apart. Terminal velocity assumes it has time to break up into particles the balance surface tension (one water molecule sticking to the next) with the force caused by airspeed. But if a ball of water is 30*30*80 ft, those pieces will still retain an impressive size, a few gallons each, by the time they hit you even from a height of 300-400 feet. With water weighing about 8 lbs/gallon, if just 20 of those hit you in a second, you've been pummeled by over 400lbs of water moving about 350-400mph...

But geneticists who stick their necks out a little and talk possibilities for the coming decades, in any area of genetic research, consistently blow me away.

As far as advice, I'd recommend trauma counseling including EMDR treatment, it's extremely effective for victims of PTSD. Second, there are programs out there which rescue dogs and train them to be service/emotional support dogs specifically for veterans, trained to recognize incoming PTSD episodes and to ""ground"" (take a bodily protection position and express wholeheartedly that you're covered). They were started in direct response to the suicide rates among combat vets, and they do help. I'd recommend finding one for yourself; The programs work hard to match you with a specific dog that fits your needs and personality; and you may find great purpose and joy in connecting people you think are at risk for suicide or may become such a risk in the future. When one feels like you do, it often helps to feel like you can do something. To find an ongoing purpose fighting this rampant problem.

AskReddit,f4pku79,t1_f4pbgki,1571736311.0,"This is absolutely a thing. There's a known racket in my area where impound lots charge so much per day that their lien totals the value of even nice, newer cars within a couple weeks. People with the money to do it sometimes end up buying their cars back a few times over. People without much money often end up just immediately handing over the title plus several hundred dollars in admin fees, because they know if they ever have another car impounded they're not getting it back without paying back the yard for all the time the first one was stored until the lot gets the title via lien (weeks, and their fees accrue until that day). That means the entire value of the first car, plus usually at least $10k for the storage time between the lien totalling the car and the new title getting to them, plus whatever fees accrue on the next car before you can come up with all that goddamn cash. Lots of people live out their lives in fear of ever being towed again, and die owing tens of thousands for basically having their cars stolen while they were walking for parts after breaking down on the highway. Did I mention this whole scam includes the impound companies that the cops and state troopers call?"

RimWorld,f170jdo,t3_d83vvt,1569231359.0,"I'll share my modlist here:

http://imgur.com/gallery/ObqNf7F

I have some that are doubled up because I found a better one but didn't want to risk removing the older one; such as base robots replaced by misc robots, fishing nets by fishing, maybe a couple others. Check each one to see if it's for you, but I feel most of then just add more of what is Rimworld to the base game, and keep the balance fairly well. Rimatomics and dubs bad hygiene (both authored by dubwise) are save-compatible and are basically just additional systems you can build and incorporate into your base, that each come with minor but well-balanced health/needs add-ons for your colonists.

A Rimworld of magic is save-compatible (though I'd absolutely recommend a new colony if you want to use it), but is NOT removable, as it goes so far as to add drop items to random tiles on the map and entire factions that center on magic. It's a total overhaul of quite a few base game mechanics, but a very fun and fairly balanced mod that still totally feels like Rimworld. Fun to play with medieval mods of any sort including furniture mods of your choice, if you want to shoot for a tabletop RPG feel.

I'm not running genetic rim because I use a nearly-potato laptop and like to play within 20 minutes of launching the game, but if you're looking to expand base gameplay to include in genetic research, and have a decent rig, run that alongside questionable ethics and you can make yourself a full-on gene editing lab. If you have questions about load orders or any of those mods, reply here and I'll share what I know."
