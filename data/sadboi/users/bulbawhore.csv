He was also already aware of my anxiety and depression, so I figured it wouldn’t be a huge shock to him. He was unaware of the disorder, and rather than explaining the “stereotypical” symptoms to him I just told him what specifically affects me. Luckily he has handled it very well, and has actually gone as far as purchasing books about the disorder to better understand me."
