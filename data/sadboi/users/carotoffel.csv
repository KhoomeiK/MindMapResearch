AmItheAsshole,f0ougku,t1_f0oti0y,1568820514.0,"Wow wow wow okay you‘re definitely transphobic.

1.) In LGBT, 3/4 of the letters reference secual orientations. How would anyone immediately think you‘re trans? If someone really DOES think that, just clear it up if you‘re that concerned with it. It sounds like you have some masculinity/femininity issues, I can‘t imagine wh anyone comfortable with how they look would be that pressed about this.

2.) Trans people and Gay/Lesbian/Bi people have always had to stand together to make a change. All of them (not EVERY single aueer person, but each group) have been despised, discriminated against, sent to reorientation camps or even been murdered just because of who they are. It‘s about respecting those who fought for you before you were even bored. Wouldn‘t you be offended if a trans person just claimed to be part of the T-community, because LGB would make them feel undesirable and judged while still being adamant about not being homophobic?

3.) This is why you‘re transphobic. The last sentence really sold me on that one. There‘s a difference between having a personal preference and deeming a whole group of people undesirable. Just because you are not trans or you don‘t want to date trans people, doesn‘t mean other people don‘t."
AmItheAsshole,f0oswmj,t3_d5yy2e,1568819494.0,"I‘ll say YTA.

Do you label yourself as Lesbian, Gay AND Bisexual? Do all people assume you are all of those when you tell them you are LGB? 
Also your reasoning is something I don‘t quite get - you exclude a group of people because you want to implicate to others that you don‘t want to date trans people? How is that relevant? Everyone has dating preferences, no need to justify yourself for them. Also, if people assume you‘re trans it‘s most likely not because you left out a letter while introducing yourself (which is... odd to beginn with IMO. I don‘t go around inteoducing myself to others by mentioning I‘m LGBT.), but because of the way you look/your voice/maybe your mannerisms. If it‘s people you know falsley assuming you‘re trans/you‘d like to date trans people, just correct them. I‘m pretty sure it‘s quite far-fetched though for random friends of you to wake up one day and concern themselves with if you‘d date a trans person or not.

I would understand it, if you‘d like to not be part of the LGBT community as a whole even though you are queer, as the community can be perceived (and in some parts is) toxic, hypocritical and way too PC, but excluding one part of your community who have struggled just as much/more than you seems a bit weird to me. If you are THAT concerned with how other people see you/ what they assume about you and your are really asked what your sexual preferences just say you‘re gay/lesbian/bisexual/etc. If you are uncertain just say queer or simply not straight. 
If it‘s sex/gender you‘re concerned about just say  you‘re a cis male/female. Case closed. 
And also, your dating preferences are yours alone. I think in this case it‘s more about paying respects, but that‘s just my view of things."
