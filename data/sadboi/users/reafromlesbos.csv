lgbt,fhnq9nj,t3_f42dfl,1581730788.0,"Honey, from experience I can tell you that if these thoughts ever cross your mind, you are trans, and that’s such a beautiful thing. Sometimes it takes a while for family to come around but having your sister to support you will be extremely important, especially when trying to convince your dad that you’re old enough to know for yourself. You have the world at your fingertips and you have to hold onto that happiness that you feel when you express yourself as a woman. Keep your head up and do everything you can do and feel comfortable doing to be yourself. You’re amazing and we are all here to support you ❤️"
