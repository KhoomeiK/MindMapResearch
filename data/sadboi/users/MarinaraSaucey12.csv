relationship_advice,fqg3to9,t3_gi9vko,1589337390.0,"I had a lot of issues with my body regarding that area, not endometriosis, but I think I can shed a few thoughts as I had some similar feelings. You can’t help her. She’ll always feel like less of a woman, as if she’ll have no worth. She’ll be scrolling on Facebook and see pictures of babies or women expecting and have a sense on longing for that connection. She may have wanted kids, maybe even she didn’t, but it still hurts. Even if she didn’t want kids, it was her choice. The feeling of that choice being taken away from you, stolen from you, is different then the choice you make yourself. Women are programmed biologically to procreate and for some women they can’t have that. She is going to be angry, sad, confused, etc. She’ll grieve and not understand why. I’ve found myself screaming to the Gods “why me” and she’ll be sad there isn’t an answer. One day, though it might take a while, she’ll get up and she’ll move forward. She’ll never move on, knowing she may not be able to has kids. But she’ll move forward. It takes time but in the end it’ll be okay.

My story (I’ll try and make it short): I couldn’t have sex. At first, nobody believed me. I was “just inexperienced,” “just needed more lube” or even “was being dramatic” when I described being in massive pain. My own mom even said I wasn’t being truthful and that it was supposed to hurt like that and over over it. Doctors didn’t take me seriously and eventually, with the right doc, they found out I had Vulvodynia. I got surgery and although I’m “all healed” I still have a journey ahead of me. I tell you this because there will be people who won’t believe her. They’ll tell her she’s being dramatic when she says she in pain and make her feel worthless. Do what my mom didn’t do, make her feelings validated. If I had help from my mom in the beginning I wouldn’t have had as many issues as I do today. 

You can’t protect her from her new journey ahead but that doesn’t mean she has to walk alone. I hope this helped."

Your son and your daughter in law have been having problems because your son is a shit husband. He GOT TURNED OFF by HIS BABIES KICKING? That is a MAGICAL MOMENT. What man says that let alone thinks about his dick privileges when talking about his BABIES? “He is very much adherent of healthy living, so it was hard for him” “she would leave the table to devour leftovers” “he got her a gym membership and buy her healthy food.” SHE IS PREGNANT! Let me say it in a tone you’re understand, during pregnancy YOURE EATING MORE THAN JUST YOURSELF. SHE ISNT FAT SHE LITERALLY HAS TWO HUMANS INSIDE HER. 
“Made him feel like his wife was simply not trying for him” SHE IS PREGNANT WITH TWINS!!!!!!!!!!

Also, men do not get traumatized when they see birth. If that was the case we’d have every dad with PTSD. My dad describes crying when I started coming out of my mom, getting to hold me, and everything that comes with it. Your son contemplating wether or not to go to THE BIRTH OF HIS OWN CHILDREN (which constitutes as high risk BTW) and you telling him not to makes you the asshole. Also don’t get us with the “the pandemic is bad” bullshit. We all know it’s cause you didn’t want him to witness her vagina being “ruined” since it’s so “traumatizing to men.” Also, considering how he acted the whole pregnancy, treating her like she was fat and not being attractive for him (in your words) I wouldn’t let him in either or let him name my daughters. I hope she gets full custody and he never steps foot in their lives- the last thing those baby girls need is a dad who values their self-worth by what they look like. Also, birth won’t scar your son at all. 

Also, let me say this. Your son was raised by you completely, we can tell. What man treats his wife and daughters like that? God forbid she looks pregnant. I also didn’t see any mention of you hoping the babies were healthy considering the complications that arise with twins. It probably was even worse mentally and emotionally for DIL because of how horrible her HUSBAND and MIL treated her. If my daughter had a “man” like that I wouldn’t allow him near my granddaughters. I hope you advise your DIL to divorce your son, she deserves a better husband and the twins desperate a better dad. 

As a psychology major I can already see what type of father he will be. His daughters won’t be pretty enough for him, maybe they’ll be a bit chubby or have a intellectual defect etc, and he won’t accept them. Even if they’re perfect he’ll find something wrong with them. Wether it be their nose is too big or their smile is too wide. He seems like the first person to say, “that dress makes you look fat” to his wife when she spends money trying to look good to him. He mentally SCARRED HIS WIFE by treating her like an object that needs to satisfy his needs while also basically calling her fat and unattractive the whole time cause she ate too much and put on weight- something every single pregnant woman has gone through in the history of time. You’re a bad mother for allowing your son to be raised like that. If I was you, I’d be utterly mortified."

AmItheAsshole,fq6l97z,t1_fq64bgz,1589133687.0,"I want her to change how she said it if a stupid is in my position because saying that could have negative affects. She is an advisor, here to HELP, not belittle. There’s a way to phrase things. Belittling students won’t make them want to come to you and get help and could obstruct their success. There was a psychological study about preschoolers. To my memory I believe they told one class (or half the class I forget) that they were amazing at math and another class (or the other half) they were bad at math. They found that the class they said was GOOD at math ended up getting higher math scores than those they said was bad at math. Similarly, the same could be the same for this case. The more you tell a student they won’t succeed, the less they’re likely to succeed. Some strive on this and others crumble. As an advisor it’s your JOB to not take the latter and HELP those students succeed. Like I said before, there is bluntness and being disrespectful. To me, she was disrespectful. As someone told me somewhere before, she could have said,

“Your grades suck right now and you are unlikely to get into grad school, HOWEVER, here are some things you can do to help you increase your likely hood.”

“Right now you can’t take 18 credits but let’s work in ways you CAN make this a possibility”

“Right now with these current scores you wouldn’t be accepted into this school but let’s change that. What are some classes or resources you need to better yourself in these areas?” 

But she didn’t do that. She didn’t offer resources, which at my school she is required to do for struggling students, even when I reported to her about a harassment. She only told me basically I won’t succeed or get anyway without helping me or telling me ways I *could* succeed. It’s like going to your professor about a bad grade and then saying “lol that sucks bro” besides saying “hey I noticed you failed this test. I can’t have you retake it but how about you come to my office hours and we can figure out what went wrong and fix what you didn’t understand.” That isn’t coddling, that’s doing your job. I’m a teacher assistant (part-time) and that’s what we’re supposed to do. We’re here to teach, educate, and help. I’m not saying she has to tell me I’m amazing and whatnot, but offering resources and helping students better themselves to succeed is her job that she is paid to do. If you’re going to go into a field of helping students, maybe you should actually help them. 

Though, I apologize for the long response. I just disagree with her methods and believe for others it can have even worse affects."
