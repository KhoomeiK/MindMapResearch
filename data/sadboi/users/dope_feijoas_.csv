Anyone who instantly shuts down after being told their feelings aren’t valid is making themselves and the person believe that their feelings aren’t valid, making the stigma worse. This goes to all genders, man up and stick up for yourself."

BPD,fo99xwb,t1_fo73qka,1587614014.0,This is exactly how I felt after my break up from a 3 year relationship 6 months ago. Every month a I’ve felt this way more and more.

I know it’s a struggle to come back from something like this especially because it can be so up and down, but I’m proud of you for getting where you are now! Gaining weight can be terrifying but you just gotta remember it’s about being healthy and feeling good (easier said than done of course)."

I’m sure anyone can agree this advice is valid from a teenager or not. Next time maybe try not making someone feel worse in an already shitty situation."
BPD,f8wajft,t3_e2m55x,1574886584.0,I got this a lot with my now ex. We dated for 3 years and it’s been a week since we broke up. I felt it after the first year and on and off it would happen but definitely happened more often towards our break and ya actually breaking up.
BreakUp,f8tx6ii,t1_f8tpjp5,1574813481.0,Thank you so much. I’m trying my best to keep a positive outlook but it does get overwhelming quiet often especially since I’ve always struggled with my mental illness but I’m doing better than I thought I would be at least. I’m trying to occupy myself more so I don’t think about it as much which is hard but it’s helping a little. I’ve had a lot of support from people on reddit which is probably helping the most especially since I don’t have many friends irl.
BreakUp,f8twv7h,t1_f8tko2y,1574813246.0,Thank you. I was thinking the first week would be the hardest. It’s my first break up and we were together for 3 years so it’s definitely hitting as hard as I expected it too but I do think it will get better.
BreakUp,f8twpnq,t1_f8tdaza,1574813134.0,Thank you and thank you for letting me know ❤️
