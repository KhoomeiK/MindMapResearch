Cooking,fqwrs0m,t3_gldmpi,1589715451.0,"Maybe I can help!

You need to press your tofu to remove the maximum water. I wrap the tofu in paper towels and between two boards or plates with canes on the top. I let it stay like this for 15 min. I change the paper towels in the middle.

After your tofu is pressed, you wrap your tofu cube in cornstarch. Then in a pan with oil, you cook it til it's golden each side. If you want seasoning your tofu, do your spices mixes and add cornstarch in the mix.

You'll get a crispy tofu."
