>People with BPD already have an overabundance of holding themselves accountable for every failing, whether it was their fault or not.

Yup, exactly. I can tell people how my parents were negligent but deep down I feel that I let it happen. I wasn't resilient enough. When I told her I spent all my effort to self-reflect she acted unimpressed, rather than acknowledging that effort, she'd rather focuse on how shallow and ""incorrect"" the outcome was. I mean fair enough but at the end of the day when I walked out of that room it only reinforced the idea that it's all my fault.

I tell myself that too, that I have to learn to appreciate the things and people I have in my life and stop whining because there are children dying from starvation/cancer etc. But the truth is we cannot compare suffering, or success for that matter. We cannot gather every sad person in this world and vote to see who's the most misfortunate one and only they're allowed to be depressed, that's just not how it works.

Don't listen to your family, listen to yourself. You're important. Your problems and suffering are real and deserve to be cared for."
