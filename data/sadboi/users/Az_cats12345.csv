Anxiety,fd03r74,t1_fcvjrwu,1578113193.0,"It has nothing to do with unions really. The reason the rent is too damn high is because we have a Zionist controlled federal reserve issuing us a fraud debt currency not backed by gold which allows these cultures to confiscate all our wealth through inflation. The answer is already in the constitution. Get govt out of the economy, no income taxes, no central bank manipulating interest rates, and gold backing the currency. Those in control of the printing press enrich themselves by printing fake currency  out of thin air not backed by gold and that causes the rent to get too damn high. 60 years ago under a gold standard the term ""income inequality"" wasn't even a term anyone knew or said. 60 years off off a gold standard and income inequality is a top 3 political issue. You guys are absolutely right about what's happening you just don't know what the root of the problem is"
