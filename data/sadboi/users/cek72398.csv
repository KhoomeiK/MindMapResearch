That was a day about you and your husband (congratulations to you two as well, I hope your life is filled with all the joy and happiness in the world) and your ""friend"" should have recognized that.  She should have saved that announcement for another day and time and should have been there to support you on your special day. I'm not sure if anyone has already said this in the comments, but I just wanted to share this before I got carried away haha. Your ""friend"" needs to stop thinking that the world revolves around her. I mean, congrats on her baby, but there is a time and place for everything, including pregnancy announcements.
