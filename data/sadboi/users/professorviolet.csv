therapy,fqok0zb,t3_gjzt7r,1589517047.0,"That’s awesome! I’m also doing EMDR via tele therapy. I’m glad to hear someone else is having great success. I cant really say the same for myself. Having to do the tapping on my own throws me off so badly. How are you doing the tapping? Is it on your knees or your hands in a butterfly shape on your chest tapping? 

I’m interested in seeing if there’s an even easier way to do the tapping without it being so distracting to me."
therapy,fpiiju2,t3_gdiio9,1588641634.0,"Your post reminds me very much of one of the people who raped/ molested me growing up. He seems like the most wonderful human and he is looked up to by so many. I’ve heard many children say “ when I grown I want to be just like you” 

When it came to my accusations. He completely denied them and to this day will not admit it. 

Because he was looked up to by so many, he was always defended and I was always made to look like I was a liar and stupid for making this accusation. 

So as much as you may feel sorry for him, I’m over here just thinking what awful scars the children whom he affected are left with. 

I have severe ptsd from these events. I’m a full grown adult and these scars still sit here. Imagine those children and what their life may be like from now on."

therapy,fp8vfhc,t3_gc0iqd,1588404335.0,"I do not have much experience with your particular issues. However it seems like you could benefit from therapy. Someone who is experienced in this, just an fyi you can make it easier on yourself by calling a therapy office and asking to work with someone who has experience with the particular trait you have found through your research. I have noticed that speaking to someone who can guide me through my thoughts and feelings has been a major help with dealing with how to ”fix” them. Hope that tid bit helps. I hope you find the relief you're looking for."

It’s been really difficult to get comfortable, plus my rapid eye movement is done by me tapping my knees a ( again, difficult to keep track of and also let myself get really comfortable (( usually you can use tappers specifically for this type of therapy— which is what my therapist was using on our in person visit)) because of all of this I want to pause therapy all together. Yet, ptsd doesn’t really pause for anyone so it’s been rough!"

therapy,fkwkw8u,t3_fl3azn,1584595696.0,"I definitely had/ have this issue. Some days worse than others. From what I gather from therapy it may stem from a trauma/ anxiety. 

For me it’s a safety issue, I never feel safe. So talking to people means my brain starts going a mile a minute assessing everything. My therapist taught me a coping mechanism I’ve tried to keep in mind every time I feel anxiety rising as I meet or talk to someone. ( I have to practice grounding myself and repeating I’m safe) 

I would suggest trying your best to notice the times this is worse for you, is it just a constant thing? What makes it worse, what makes it better. 
Write it down, and write down how it makes you. If you can’t  speak to your therapist you can always read them your written thoughts 

Hope it gets better for you! I’m cheering you on!"

dogs,fi8xz44,t3_f70ni0,1582250963.0,"We also adopted a 3 year old lab/pit mix recently. She’s also very submissive, so submissive she would submissive pee when she would get excited or when the alpha ( my husband) got home/ raised his voice. So just throwing it out there maybe just be ready for that if it becomes a thing. This girl is the best dog ever. She just wants to be loved. I’m sure your new companion will be soooo happy! Also, thank you for adopting!"

askaustin,feiz3oy,t3_epczbb,1579151307.0,"Not sure if you’re into the typical tourist stuff like, taking pictures at all the austin murals. 

There’s a delicious place called Crepe Crazy on South Lamar by Torchys. It’s great food and owned  and  operated by deaf workers. They experience is pretty unique. 

My only other suggestion is kayaking lady bird lake. Bats aren’t back yet or else I’d tell you to watch for them too.  

Have fun!!"

asl,f9szp1h,t1_f9sijp1,1575604584.0,"Good work, just a tip: don’t rush yourself. Take it all in good pace. We all do this when we start learning. It’s important to sign things accurately, proper placement and facial expression are super important. 

If and when you rush, your signs could end up looking sloppy and could give off the wrong meaning. 

I’ve been signing for 15+ years and I remember my enthusiasm for learning made me want to rush my signs all at once. Don’t do that, take your time. Deaf will appreciate it!"
