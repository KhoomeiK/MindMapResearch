Amd,fqwenk2,t1_fquutsx,1589701716.0,I rescued one of those 580s for my sim rig for a couple month but it got demoted to my second sim rig to make room for the 5700 ultra thiccccccc. But I got a killer deal on the 580 last year $95 shipped. Dude said it was beat on from mining. Still kicking strong and running vr like a champ
TheSilphRoad,fpqhyd4,t1_fpp0ikk,1588823214.0,I was excited that they were doing remote raiding. I installed the game again bought some passes for the raid hour only to find out it's not actually remote....... I was assuming I'd be able to pick up gyms close to me but that is not the case. I can see 0 raids from my house the closest gym is 5 minute car ride. Real chapped
HomeNetworking,fpkpo9d,t1_fpi3tz6,1588698869.0,Nope haven't had cable for like 15 some years. The packages in my area are shit. Just the way the cookie crumbles. We don't even have an option for 500 mpbs let alone 1000 mpbs.
HomeNetworking,fph03mk,t3_gdbfe1,1588612595.0,I have 0 choice of ISP I am stuck with Comcast. I have had my account for 6 years at the current location. They will no longer give me discounts. I have tried every couple of months to get my bill lowered from $90 for 100mbps with no luck. They know I ain't got a choice they give 0 fucks
techsupportgore,fp7c33w,t1_fp65tna,1588367824.0,This is the correct answer. Not too many buisness's that move out will leave their Network gear behind even if it is a patch panel. This isn't the end of the world. If you are a 2 man team you can have the one man running around up top and plug into each port they find so you can tone it out and create a nice laid out patch panel. Or you could do it the barbarian way and just punch them all down and have a mess of a patch panel the choice is yours choose wisely. I'd pick the first one and while I'm at it I'd lable each cable just in case you need to for what ever reason remove the patch panel you are set for future expansions.
techsupportgore,fp7bme4,t3_gbifzh,1588367578.0,Time to play a fun game I like to call guess that port! Lol it's such a favorite of mine!
vjing,fosbbhj,t1_forkn7q,1588027387.0,"Yup our crew is only 6 deep to run this with 3 djs per live stream everyone's wearing their face masks and we clean the cdjs after ever artist. They have a chill area behind us with more than enough room for everyone to be apart. While I am not too concerned about the virus we are following guide lines. I interact with more people going to the grocery store than who is here. 


Ya, I have noticed a lot of DJs if they don't have a manager always send us shit res pictures. I just trace over them and save as png. It's a big time waste but it's got to be done. I then share it with them in hopes they send it to other people when they dj... Lol"
vjing,foqx2hd,t1_fon8x6q,1588002339.0,Ehh it's not so much a problem man. 4 of the guys on my team live with each other and my buddy who owns High-frequency productions and I have been working alongside each other for over a week now. Not too worried about whats going on in the world today. I go into my job once a week and am the only one in my office. I go out to the grocery store every 2 weeks and do it late at night so very little interaction with the public.
vjing,foqwkmk,t1_fon13uh,1588002095.0,This is for live streaming right now with 2 companies combined. Wublife ent and high-frequency productions. Since both the companies are not doing anything due to quarantine we decided to link and up and throw live streams to keep the names out there.
vjing,foqwerm,t1_fomvd0b,1588002015.0,"Hell ya man, They were dope! and also really great people! I don't know most of our DJs most of the time since our venue generally books riddim because it sells. But I was excited about animalÃ© which is a buddy I went to school with and Birthday party because I actually knew their mixing style and loved it."
vjing,foqw0mi,t1_folr397,1588001822.0,"Normally at our venue, I set up a desktop with a big monitor so I can you know actually see my workspace."
vjing,foqvwml,t1_folhwd6,1588001765.0,We are just streaming localish DJ's pretty much our outreach is pretty far though we have brought artists from all over the states when we were actually throwing shows. I think for now we are just keeping it local Milwaukee/Chicago based DJs. But I don't deal with any of that stuff I am just told when/where/time and the DJs for the event. You won't believe how many Dj's don't have PNG's of their own logos I end up remaking most of them.
vjing,foqvhlh,t1_fokzt9z,1588001554.0,"Thanks man, I will probably throw a couple of questions your way this week as I prepare for next week's live stream."
vjing,fomhoii,t1_fom6vu9,1587890407.0,Thanks man. I only credit neb cuz it was in the screenshot! But I got a lot of beepel stuff too! I just haven't had the time to learn cenima 4d with my full time job. I rely on the free to use content at the moment. Since this is kind of my side project and doesn't pay the bills but I enjoy the hell out of it!
vjing,foldxma,t1_folbcjx,1587860167.0,I would love to see it in person too!! Those damn strobes had me blinded lmao
vjing,fokz7lr,t1_fokjcmm,1587851761.0,Well it's my buddy who doesn't fuck around. He was like I got all this shit but no gigs atm let's get wublife live streaming since we can't out on shows either. We literally remodeled our venue 3 weeks before quarantine but before that we were hitting capacity almost every weekend.
vjing,fokyzlj,t1_foknzo9,1587851640.0,"Thanks for the info! I was the one adjusting the wall ðŸ˜‚ and resolume. While my buddy who owns all this stuff was setting up cameras and lighting. I still don't know much about setup and way over did my slices I'll talk to my buddy about this maybe he can help me get this right before the stream tonight. Unfortunately we are getting to the warehouse an hour before start so it may have to be setup for next week's stream. I generally are using 4 projectors at our venue that are 1920 x 1080 output and didn't even think about the pixel width! 

That's why I said pointers welcome! Thanks dude!"

We throw weekly events before the quarantine stuff happened. But since this quarantine keeps going longer we decided to start living streaming shows with artists that have played for us in the past! I will let the wublife team know your thoughts! We are hoping that the next stream will be much smoother. We haven't done much streaming stuff. So we are learning as we go.

chicagoEDM,fn42ctv,t1_fn3tj41,1586632646.0,Naw I made a cat5e 200ft cable into the woods. Restream was having issues with playing to Facebook it kept dropping it but twitch wasn't being dropped. My buddies didn't know you could restart the connection to Facebook without interruption to twitch.

ProjectCARS_2,fn0pn4a,t3_fybx7o,1586546358.0,They need more of these types of cars in the next project cars. I would really love it if they could do somthing like Forza with upgrades and stuff. But I would love to be able to drive like a 95 Honda Civic hatch or a Camry the race cars are cool but I would like some more non supercar stock options. If Forza wasn't programed like crap for physics making ever car feel like you're on ice I'd play that game as well

I just started VDJing for my buddies company about 2 months ago. They throw weekly EDM events and I have set up 4 projectors for our stage design."
GameStop,fljyzsc,t1_flicgd6,1585230260.0,I worked for this company for a couple of years back in the early 2000s. While I had fun because I was a teenager at the time and my store had a great group of people. The corporate side of that company though was a whole different story. I am glad that GameStop has literally never changed.... They haven't even adopted with the times.... I haven't spent money there since I quit when I was a teenager.

Comcast_Xfinity,fd7hk0z,t1_fd70e12,1578204621.0,Literally my only option for internet..... Would love to have at least one other option. While yes Comcast has been extremely stable but the $90 I pay for my speeds is getting annoying plus the data caps..... I have 5 gaming pcs I eat a lot of data when new games come out. I've been downloading on one and moving the game folder to my NAS then to the others.
Comcast_Xfinity,fd58p64,t1_fd55lc2,1578175245.0,They really should just charge a normal rate for their service but we all know that won't happen untill the Monopoly is broken. I see no sign of the Monopoly being broken anytime soon and Comcast knows this this why they are free to charge what they want and how they want and the only thing you can do is to pay or not to pay.
evilbuildings,fcs8vac,t1_fcrtw9f,1577913094.0,I went to Amsterdam for my dirty 30 2 years ago and we ended up going there. The place was absolutely packed but damn was the food good! It did feel really wierd being on a boat that dang big eating Chinese food though lol

I have been wanting to get an f1 wheel too. I didn't know I would like f1 racing so much."
simracing,fbi4teb,t1_fbi2qd7,1576890802.0,I am sure if I have issues I can either contact the seller on eBay or fanatec directly. I have always had no issues buying electronics odd eBay and using manufacturers support. You send them all the info with your order from eBay and they should take care of it specially with it being fanatec.
simracing,fbi2myl,t1_fbhujeu,1576889029.0,That's a big commitment for me would have to be later on. I been racing on a tmx pro

simracing,fbi2jt4,t1_fbhyud5,1576888959.0,Sure was! And only took a couple of days to get it! I think I bought the last bundle because I was looking at it for like 2 weeks then saw only one left and said fuck it. I don't have $1300 but my credit card does lol
simracing,fbhtvcx,t3_edhd6w,1576882200.0,"I have been wanting a fanatec setup for years. I finally just said fuck it when I found this bundle on eBay for $1299 free shipping......

battlestations,f7z2yi6,t1_f7ydjjo,1574104526.0,Luckily I only have 2 shy ass cats so not too worried about it. But I did think about picking cup holders up from pepboys or something. The rigs are extremely stable so they don't wobble or move around.

This is my house! Thank you, everyone, for the kind words on how my basement is setup!

Both those TV's were given to me for free. They had burnt out LED's I took them both apart and replaced all the LED's in them for like $30 each tv. The racing wheels are my buddies that no longer had space to store them so I acquired them since they know how I treat my equipment. I work in IT so I am very anal when it comes to keeping stuff clean and orderly. They both had been attached to metal racing rigs that were super unstable and wobbly. I found that blue racing seat that I am sitting in, in a trash can. The seat is an actual Forza cobra seat. I saw it sticking out the top of a trash can one morning on my way to work and had to do a double-take! Once I got the seat I built that first rig. I just built the second rig on Friday.

One computer though is a really old i7 1366 socket with 8gb and a gtx 650. The one I am sitting at is an hp8200 SFF with 16gb of ram and RX580 8gb card all hacked together to fit a btx board into an atx case and a wire harness conversion to fit the proprietary hp board. I have another HP8200 SFF that I purchased a low profile 1650 for just waiting on that to come in to get it all set up."

Those tvs were free and only cost me about $30 each for new LED's and some time to take them apart and replaced the LED's. So while yes not ideal, they were basically free so I won't complain."
simracing,f7unblh,t1_f7uke7j,1574016271.0,The first rig took me a couple of days because I built it myself and just kept second-guessing myself spacing and shit. The second rig I modified the version just a bit but that one only took a night to build because I had the first rig to go off of.

simracing,f55s5vv,t1_f54bvrh,1572012827.0,"I am a diy guy, I also take all my buddies broken down tools and equipment throw a couple bucks at it and have a $200+ leaf blower for $25. I am lower middle class I am in the educational IT field. So I make due with what I can afford. If I can make something a little better for a couple of bucks and some time figuring out how then I'd rather do that then over extend my already over extended pay check. 


My neighbor let me Barrow his thrustmaster tmx pro wheel, pedals, shifter. So I built my sim rig entirely out of recycled wood a burnt out 55"" smart TV that I got for free. I spent all of $20 on new/used LED strips off eBay and put the thing back together. I found an old cobra Forza seat in the garbage on the way to work one morning that I soaked the seat and used a carpet cleaner on it. I am using an old hp8200 sff elite with 16gb of ram 128gb SSD 1tb wd black and a used rx580. I pretty much built my entire rig off used parts and spent very little on it since I had most of everything I needed to build it.

I am also a built not bought type of guy. Anyone can go out and buy something but not everyone can build their own. Just my 2 cents. Also I like this mod I wanted to do something similar to the thrustmaster shifter."

Justrolledintotheshop,f4wcvyn,t1_f4v4fey,1571854494.0,"I agree man, the number of people who just don't get it. Your car isn't supposed to make those noises. The number of friends who call me to make sure they aren't getting ripped off is too damn high. 


Hey man I have to get my wheel bearing fixed but they are saying both my ball joints need to be replaced and an axle boot is ripped too I think they are scamming me. Naw man they are not ripping you off they have to pop the ball joint out to take your hub off to press the wheel bearing out/in so if it looks bad now it's going to be worse when the finally bust that rusted ass dry as a bone ball joint out of the control arm.


Like ya no ball joints and tie rod ends don't fuck around with if they say replace them go do a visual inspection yourself of you must but they are probably right. The amount of times I have done brake jobs for people only to jack up there cars and hear popping noises coming from their ball joints is scary. That shit breaks while driving you are more than likely going to need a new car after that let's just out it that way."

I have a few friends who are cops and know a couple of cops from working with them through my job. But I would never trust them even my buddies who turned cop. I don't play those games keep em at a distance and don't call attention to yourself live your life and love one another. The world needs more love not more cops...

YangForPresidentHQ,f1d5ew0,t1_f1cl1hh,1569374348.0,"I was the same way at the start of this year. I didn't know Jack about him. I did a bunch of research on his policies and was blown away, he really seems to be trying to better the world for everyone instead of corporate America and the billionaires. 


This is the first time in my 31 years on Earth that I have donated to a campaign. I have a bunch of friends who are well off and who have never really struggled.... They all tell me ubi will never be a thing and would never work. It's stupid to give free money to people whole buy drugs blah blah blah same ol song and dance. But then they write off that AI and automation are displacing the fact that this is even a problem. They tell me I am waste a vote and that I should only choose from who has the best chance to win.... Like we keep on doing that and electing the same type of person and they just keep fucking the middle class real good. I am lower middle class and I am struggling to stay afloat with a full time career job.... I also purchased a shirt to rock, I am actually wearing it right now to my bowling league which is more so filled with older retired guys who have made some disgusting comment about yang...."

paragon,f1bh4mr,t1_f1andfa,1569334435.0,"I wish they would stop it.... Back when fortnite was leading the way for cross play I jumped on. I was finally able to play with my old Xbox crew that I had not played with in at least 15 years. It was exciting.


I only put in the $10 for the first battle pass and never out anymore money into the game I hated the core game play of fortnite but I was able to play with old buddies fast forward a season or 2 and I was addicted to those damn challenges for some stupid skins. Why you ask? I have no damn idea but epic did such a good job of designing the game to be addictive that it got me and not for me actually liking to play either......


Now that I have given a handful of my Xbox players some old office PC's and had them pick up a LP 1050ti to get into the PC life. I have converted 4 of them and we are now playing other games. I finally got them away from fortnite. 


I had them download unreal tournament and they were having a blast and we're asking me when the game was going to come out of alpha...... That's when I had to break the news that it will never leave alpha as long as fortnite is  a money printing press. Then I showed them paragon and they were asking me when it comes out. Again had to tell them epic stop production and shut down their servers once fortnite started to gain traction.


 I am really hoping this steam version remake knocks it out of the park, blows away all expectations and makes this new studio so much bank that epic becomes salty."

UnethicalLifeProTips,f11y39s,t1_f1037sm,1569132174.0,"Can confirm, I worked for a company that had 0 sick days and only 2 weeks PTO. You couldn't take a day off without using a PTO day no matter what the case may have been. So In reality you only had a week of actual vacation time.

We were forced mandatory over time. Average week for us was 53-65ish hours, our bodies would be running on E 90% of the month. There was always some sort of sickness bouncing between our departments. I pulled plenty of 16 hour shifts when I had the flu and should be out but since I needed my PTO for an actual vacation I'd come into work.


Thankfully now I work for a job that gives me about 25+ ""sick"" days plus sick time rolls over each year. We can not take more than 2 sick days off in a row without a doctors note. Our sick days are there for being sick/doctors/dentist/car repair/hour repair. Basically anything we need it for which is a damn game changer. I also get 2 weeks PTO and the longer I work there the more PTO I get."
AbsoluteUnits,f0z5gn3,t1_f0yk15i,1569086864.0,"I agree man. Like holy shit this is the biggest one we have seen! Let's fucking kill it! 



Like fucking why man are you without food stranded in the wild and this is your only damn chance of survival? Then ya shoot it eat it and make some crock skin shoes or some shit. But just to kill it to say you killed the biggest is an asshole move. One the animal never knew it was playing a game and 2 you're a dick.



I am not some tree hugging hippie but the older I get the more and more I fucking hate humanity."
