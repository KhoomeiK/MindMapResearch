MacMiller,ey946av,t1_ey8rkzg,1566934847.0,"Huh... Memento Mori? Or what I wrote? 

Cause Memento Mori is from Mac Miller's track Self Care off his last album Swimming. 

It's also from Artist:¬†Aephanemer

Album:¬†Memento Mori

Released:¬†2016

Genre:¬†Metal

The more elaborate and comprehensive meaning is; 

Memento mori¬†(Latin: ""remember (that) you will die"")[2]¬†is the medieval¬†Latin Christiantheory and practice of reflection on mortality, especially as a means of considering the¬†vanity of earthly life¬†and the¬†transient nature of all earthly goods¬†and pursuits. It is related to the¬†ars moriendi¬†(""The Art of Dying"") and similar Western literature.¬†Memento mori¬†has been an important part of ascetic disciplines as a means of perfecting the character by cultivating detachment and other virtues, and by turning the attention towards the immortality of the soul and the afterlife.[3]

As for what I wrote, that's just me. So you won't find it anywhere. Although there is mention in the scriptures (Holy Bible) in the book of Revelations chapter 9 verse 6; And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them."
heartbreak,ey91sli,t1_ey8arjn,1566933326.0,"Money ain't shit. But remember that you're priceless. I know you are. If you lived close by I'd take you on a date for the sole purpose of reminding you of your worth. We may be broken but it's the broken ones that have managed to pull thorough that are the most valuable. In fact, we, if the right decisions are made, and responsibilities taken care of, become more valuable and highly sought after relationship partners than our previous significant other.

Other people don't know squat. We know.... And that's all that matters. Because one day we will become not only immovable persons, but also unstoppable. 

The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

I won't say how I truly feel and what I'm thinking most of the time as I believe no human being should ever feel pr think this way. I was in 3 relationships up until now. I'm 36. A 10 year from 16 to 26. A 5 year marriage from 28 to 33. And a 2 year from 34 to 36. This 2 year nearly killed me. What I experienced before was nothing compared to this. My heart shattered into a million pieces. I spent 3 days listening to voices in my heard screaming in pain from the actual physical pain in my chest. My heart feeling annihilated. The voices would alternate between ""it hurts so much"", ""omg it hurts"", "" God help me"" to "" ""you have to hang yourself"". ""You need to get a gun and shoot yourself in the head"". Over and over and over for 72 hours straight. I still hear them from time to time. I know myself well enough to say that it won't get easier.

I repeatedly lied and ignored my ex. I chose alcohol and cocaine over her more times than I'd like to remember. This over the span of 2 years. This all culminated with me showing up at her newly purchased condo at 4 am high and drink. Unable to pay my cab driver. Police we're called. Neighbours pouring out of their condos. I said hurtful and demeaning things to her. Spat on her.   Swallowed a bottle of my meds. Tried to choke myself with an TV cable. Told her I would throw myself off the balcony to kill myself. All of this after taking a check from an old checkbook of hers and making it out to myself for 1000$. You could very well say it was theft. I think I included every thing.

I'm a monster. I deserve to be put away for good. 
I told my friend yesterday that if people knmew how crazy I was they would lock me up and throw away the key.

depression,eve13kf,t1_eve0s3w,1564452675.0,"I'm glad you're still among us. For what it's worth.
Also that they weren't loud enough. For me it was all I could hear for the first 3 days after my breakup. 

They are still there. Only whispers here and there but I know they'll be back even louder than before if I don't shape up. 

Dig my way out rather than deeper kinda thing."
depression,evdyzec,t1_evdwlfq,1564451092.0,"No. Haven't literally killed anyone but I strongly feel like I figuratively killed my ex gf with my words and actions.

Yes. I would. Quite easily actually knowing the why and how. But even if I didn't know I still would. It would take some time though. To rebuild trust and of proof of willingness to and of change. 

What's difficult for me is that I'm afraid of hurting people so much that I can't form any true bonds. Even when I do my walls are up and I self sabotage. Either that or lose myself entirely.

Forgiveness... Even when forgiven by the others whom I've hurt I haven't come around to forgive myself yet. Part of my problem I know.

I was and have been made out to be a very bad person this time around. Which I was. I said and done things I'm ashamed of. I've lost my own dignity in the process. Recovery is improbable yet I continue to simply exist. Will I ever really live again?"
depression,evdyi4a,t1_evdwxkd,1564450740.0,I've woken up the past week wishing I was in a different life/timeline.
depression,evduec7,t1_evdt3if,1564447740.0,Appreciate the reply. :)
depression,evdudaw,t1_evdt3if,1564447718.0,"Well right now I do not. Not after what I've done. The day may come... But tis not this day. 

I definitely cannot debate the suffering more part. It's this whole needing/wanting to suffer that lead me here to begin with. 

Well I know they still love me. But that makes it worse almost. It has before. Like why and how could you love such a monster. But that kind of thinking was self destructive and a self fulfilled prophecy."
depression,evdse3g,t3_cjd5xb,1564446259.0,Yes we can and we are our worst enemy. I know. I've recently come undone and just brushing my teeth was a task. Still is.
depression,evdrkpg,t3_cja306,1564445640.0,I'm 36. 1 year old to 35 year old me is disappointed.
depression,evdqym8,t1_evdl6ob,1564445184.0,"What if you don't deserve to be happy? What if you've done too much wrong. What if even if everyone tell you they love you and want you to be well , the second you do you become afraid and engage in self destructive behavior. 

My apologies for that last part. I've been on countless rants here."
depression,evdqsn6,t3_cjisun,1564445063.0,"Forever sleep right? Hop on/in. 

I threw my towel in. Death threw it back. 

I'm still in the game but I quit a week ago. Still competing unfortunately."
