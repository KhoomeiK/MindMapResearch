Many people I have been around seem to automatically match up their opinion of Trump with their opinion on the quarentine. 

People who like Trump, seem to like lifting the quarentine. When I ask these associates why, a noticeable number refer to something Trump said and not their own state/town, data related facts to backup their thinking. And without Trump fighting to lift the quarentine, everyone WILL STARVE.

I am finding this same thing involving Trump with people who want to continue quarantine. Trump wants to lift the quarentine, therefore many of my associates seem to hate it and think it should be extended. Mainly because of something Trump did or said instead of what they see in their communities or data. These people say Trump is going to murder the masses just like the dirty rat bastard he is if this quarantine gets lifted.

It seems like the only people who give decent responses about the quarentine and whether or not to lift it are politically neutral individuals as most everyone else immediately skips the data and starts to complain about or cheer on TRRUUUUMMMP.....and then reference data"

The World Health Organization that Cried Wolf 

Does anyone feel like if you make a statement that possibly indicates you are critically thinking you will get thrown in jail, heavily fined and otherwise negative impact on quality of life? Yes. And that is the first red flag that demands more answers to questions. So World Health Organization, you demand me pay more taxes, to get stimulus money to give stimulus money to the good citizens as well as many other organizations just snuck in like we wouldn’t notice in this day of information. Many of us have actually read the document and can see the tax dollars are not being used on citizens rather a fancy shopping spree. So, get ready and explain to me-

What will the sick/death toll be as a result of anxiety, depression, suicides that result from forcing everyone to stay inside, not get income aside from a measly “stimulus” check (which they paid with their own taxes anyhow.) How many will die as a result of mental health from this power stroke?

How many are now at a higher risk for heart attack, stroke, diabetes due to staying inside and not having access to gyms and human interaction?   

You are a doctor. Your patient is a 92 year old. They pass away and test positive for COVID19. What did they die from? Can you really say the cause of death was COVID19 or, is death a part of the life cycle once a person hits a certain time they pass on? Being born is based on time. Is there a maximum age to live to? Is it honest to use the deaths of a large aging population and scare people by not disclosing age and comorbidities of patients with COVID19. 

If a patient is a chronic meth user.  Staph infections from shooting up as well, totally septic (infection of the entire body). They pass away at 30 years old and tests positive for COVID19. Is it honest to say they died from COVID19?

If a patient had a body fat percentage of 45, stroke, 27  years old but tested positive for COVID19 is it honest to say they passed away from COVID19?

To the World Health Organization that cries wolf, you need to look up what a “lie of omission” is. How many people must stay in your casket of social distancing while they should be living their lives. How is it fair for you to decide who lives and who dies? You are killing me. You are killing me and many others whose days of youth you are wasting. You only are young once and now it is being stolen. Youth have already had money stolen from them and now inherit over 20 trillion in debt because of the greed of the older generation. Don’t steal their time.

Yes, the young people need to stand up for themselves and be stood up for. You don’t make a generation miss out on graduation, summers kisses, fight for work opportunities they missed and the domino impact that will have all so a 90 plus year old person can live 5 more years maximum. 

You don’t make people go without grocery money, utility money, the structure of having a job and a life so the person who abuses their body can stay. 

You don’t shield the unlucky with the bodies of the lucky. Get out of the way World Health Organization. Mother Nature is getting out the duct tape, taking off that hot, moist mask that is a bed for germs to and duct taping you up. Time for the World Health Organization who shuts everyone in a coffin of isolation to let us out."
