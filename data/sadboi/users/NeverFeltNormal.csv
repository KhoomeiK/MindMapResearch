Just some simple facts for you

1. The Corona Virus has no vaccine and won't have one ready for mass inoculation for another 18-24 months if we are lucky.

2. With a vaccine Influenza or ""The Flu"" on average hospitalizes 3-5 million and kills 300,000-600,000 world wide annually. 

3. According to a CDC report from a few years ago in the US the Flu kills 12,000 on a low year and 60,000 on an extremely bad year. (2018 was an historical year with 80,000) So I don't know where your 150k dying in the US annually number comes from but it is way off.

4. The Corona Virus is atleast 10x more lethal than the Flu

5. These deaths and hospitalization will happen ontop of the normal Flu and other illnesses requiring hospitalization. This could very easily overload the hospital system resulting in even more deaths as we find ourselves unable to treat everyone.

6. In a hypothetical scenario in which all of the US got infected. **disclaimer this is not going to happen** If you plug in South Korea's low mortality rate of .6% (one of the lowest reported likely due to more people getting tested) we are talking nearly 2 million deaths.

Not going to lie or sugar coat it on a hot summer day in July after having seen the two movies I had waited my whole life to go see (Godzilla KOTM & Avengers Endgame) and having completed a draft of my suicide note. I was sitting in my car with a gun in my backpack writing a pro/cons list desperately trying to come up with anything in my life that was worth continuing to suffer through my near lifelong treatment resistant mental issues for.   

When I turned on my radio to hook up my phone for some cathartic music and accidentally turned the radio on to FM rather than to the Aux input. On the FM signal a local 12-3 sports radio show was talking about PAC-12 media day and how Utah was picked pre-season favorites to win the pac-12 south.

 In that moment I decided to stick around another 5 months to see if the team I had grown up watching every game since Coach Ron McBride's final season could have another successful 10 win season and perhaps make it to the PAC-12 Championship game

While I’m not going to lie and say my life or mental state has improved noticeably since I'm still jobless, flat broke, and without health insurance to get blood tests, medication refilled, or therapy I need. I will say I have in the last 4 months I have made some breakthroughs in figuring out why I am the way I am and am slowly trying my best to improve my state enough to start the agonizing job searching process and give myself a fighting chance.

I will also say I am glad I stuck around to root for the best team in our programs history win 11 regular season games and be one win away from making the Rose Bowl and potentially if things really go our way this weekend making the CFB Playoffs. 

Go Utes lets go win the PAC-12 championship game that many media pundits thought would take us 20 years to build the program and depth to be able to even reach tonight."

CPTSD,f3vo0gl,t3_dic15q,1571180562.0,"TL/DR: It makes sense when you think about it. Emotional Abuse is far harder to see and explain to others. It is also easier for the emotionally abused to doubt they were abused if the abuse/neglect was mainly/majority emotional/psychological. Which leads to worsening mental health/self esteem issues down the road.



If I talk to a random stranger/co-worker/friend about why I don't like/get along with my mother and they ask ""why don't you like your mother /u/neverfeltnormal?"" 
If I say that she sexually abused me or enabled my sexual abuser they are likely going to drop any challenge or disbelief they had right then and there.

If I say ""I don't like my mother because she physically abused me"" they may ask a few questions such as ""what kind of physical abuse?"" and ""when you were abused did you deserve it?"" Because for some people that kind of punishment is okay. But once you tell them ""My mother used to beat me because when she got drunk, putting a dish in the sink or doing the dishes too loudly triggered her into a fit of rage"" they will also drop it


If I tell a stranger I don't like my mother because she was emotionally abusive. You are far more likely to play a game of twenty questions to get around to justifying your feelings and even then a significant portion of people are going to be like well she provided you with a roof over your head, a bed to sleep in, food to eat, she made sure you went to school, and she (Almost)never physically beat you sounds like a good mother to me. 


That same thing goes through my head everyday when I debate in my head were my parents/other abusers really that bad?
 
It can be real hard for the person abused to realize and accept that the answer to that debate is YES. Yes years(Hell even days) of emotional neglect and psychological abuse are in fact serious, are not part of a normal household, and is in fact a legitimate form of abuse.
