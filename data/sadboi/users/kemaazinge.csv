depression,eturf3t,t3_cd6d58,1563218471.0,This happens to me all the time.. for 3weeks I felt fine.. I felt like myself. But then I woke up this morning feeling totally opposite.. my greatest fear is that one day I wouldnâ€™t wake up because it would have just gotten too hard and I got too weak. I wanna feel better and I want it to be for real and last.
