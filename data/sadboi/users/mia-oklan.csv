I’m a psychology student so I guess it’s in my nature to try and understand how others think (I do this to everyone, so maybe I should be more careful as to not make anyone feel like that again). What I meant is that I’ve been to other incels’ subreddits and they usually have some pretty specific and strong view on women, and I wanted to understand why that is.

I think, from reading posts from this and other related subreddits, most people here don’t feel good about being an incel, so I guess what I wanted more than anything was to try to find a way to relate more to you guys and and maybe even help you relate to us women (or single women specifically). I won’t, however, ever give my advice or opinion to someone here if they don’t want that; this is your space, not mine. That’s why I commented on this post, I felt like I had something to contribute and maybe it’d be well received.

If you want to help, that’s admirable of you, but if it starts to get too intense and you feel like you can’t handle it anymore, please stay away from their issues and let them solve it themselves.

Regarding what you can do for them, I would suggest talking to them individually and having them agree to have a mediated talk in which no one is allowed to use verbal or physical violence, as well as no use of mind altering substances. To convince them, talk about how their respective partner will also follow those rules. This might help since they keep shifting blame. During the conversation, ask pointed questions to get honest and helpful answers, but don’t let it go too far. For example, asking them to write down three things they would like their parents to change, read it out-loud, and then ask for them to explain specifically what they mean by that and what could be done to replace/ modify the behaviour. After that, you can ask them to say three things they admire in their partner. Altering from good to bad, positive to negative might help them give and accept constructive criticism easier. 

I’m not sure it’ll work, but I think it could, if they’re open to the idea of talking."

I’m not exactly sure if you feel like the second option in relation to the other guy or her mom, but I think that, while justifiable, these feelings are a little self-centred. Family is a big thing, and it’s an especially hard task to figure out how to deal with for someone with very opinionated parents, even more so in her case since, because she’s still at their house, she’s likely still dependent on them. Even if that wasn’t the case, however, I think almost everyone would put their parents before a prospective partner. In case you felt like the other guy was her first choice, I just think that’s not the case at all. She compromised to save two relationships at once. 

Besides that, you heard from a friend that she was still into you and from a friend that she had a boyfriend. Maybe she didn’t want you to feel exactly like you do now, like a second option, and wanted to explain the whole thing herself. 

As for her toying with the other guy, I’m not sure how much of that has merit. How do you know she actually toyed with him? I mean, she could have, of course, but she could also have told him she wanted to try it out and stay casual for now even without explaining the whole situation. 

Talking to her before doing anything would be my advice. Really open up to her about how you feel and tell her to be honest as well, so you can understand each other and move past it, whether this means getting together or moving on separately. 

Anyway, if you do decide to reject her, that’s perfectly fine. I was just putting out these thoughts in case you wanted a different perspective."

relationship_advice,f0lfiuz,t3_d5eqd1,1568715536.0,"I don’t know if that’s normal given as I’ve had a total of one male partner in my life, but I still relate a lot to your experience. I think men sometimes don’t equate blowjobs to licking pussy, and they expect to receive more than to give. Mainstream porn, even kinky porn, doesn’t usually have much focus on female pleasure. Sure, they make faces and sounds that look like orgasming, but mostly that’s fake, because orgasming from penetrative sex is really fucking hard (and other reasons, such as porn isn’t real sex). 

Talking to Paul about this may be hard given your shyness and your concern with his feelings, but if you don’t communicate, you’re ultimately ruining your relationship. He might be a little upset, or very upset even, but this relationship won’t ever stand a chance without honesty. Also, telling him to go down on you will not kill the mood, and if it does for him, I see this as a problem. Maybe say things like “I really like it when you go down on me” or “remember that time... (and then describe what he did in the beginning of the relationship)”, because then it sounds like a compliment and chances are his ego will be okay. You can also send suggestive texts to him while at work/ university specific to going down on you. I can’t speak for him, but as a woman who likes everyone regardless of gender, hearing what my partner wants me to do to them or what they want to do to me is hot as fuck. 

If all that doesn’t work, sit him down and have a serious conversation before you break up or end up on r/deadbedrooms. Talk slowly and calmly and try to start with positives, move on to the negatives, and end with positives. So, start by saying you enjoy certain acts in bed that you usually do (the ones that don’t make you orgasm, but are fun), then talk about how you’d like for him to go down on you a little more (and then you can add that you’ll be more than willing to do the same to him/ you’ve been doing the same to him and will continue to do so, but you’d like a little more reciprocity). You can end it by telling him how much fun sex is with him and that you love him very much, but you feel like you could improve. 

Lastly, if you’re ready to give, be ready to take (I hope that makes sense in english lol). By that I mean he might have a little criticism for you as well and you might not realise it. Just be prepared in case it happens. You are trying to improve as a couple, after all. 

Anyway, that’s just my 2 cents, but I hope it helps. Best of luck for you and Paul!"

How you managed to actually date him for three years is honestly a mystery to me. I won’t say he doesn’t love you, because maybe he does in his own fucked up way, but you deserve way better than someone who’s more concerned about his phone than you. Cheating is also the biggest red flag ever, and it’s got big block letters saying LEAVE. It doesn’t matter how he feels, it matters how you feel. If he won’t show you how special you are, you gotta let him go and find someone who will. Figure out your finances, how you’re going to do about the house since you live together, and, if you’re moving, pack your things around the house while leaving your more apparent items and clothes where they are so he won’t notice it. After that, talk to him, because you’ll have it all figured it out by then, and it’ll be easier not to get sucked in again.

TooAfraidToAsk,ewzlusr,t1_ewzkysp,1565897536.0,"Well because open public places help decrease the harm others suffer with it. I think however that today we aren’t as harmed by it as much as we are by cars and motorcycles and etc, so I don’t worry about it much."
TooAfraidToAsk,ewzjsnf,t3_cqud9a,1565896761.0,"It’s not really accepted. These days you can only really smoke at your own place or in the street, since most places don’t allow it and most people will complain. And I think the reason it’s not forbidden is that it doesn’t affect your thinking the way other drugs might and theoretically it only affects the one consuming it"
relationship_advice,ewxsfms,t1_ewxrhnp,1565867345.0,Maybe you can all have a dressed up movie night and re-enact some of the most famous scenes with some sort of comical element to it (different characters and the way they would act in this situation). Or maybe a trivia game with cool rewards and “funishments” about all these subjects.
AmItheAsshole,ewr2tk3,t1_ewr2axs,1565691925.0,"I understand that, and it seems like a very complicated situation. 

If you want my advice instead of my judgement, try to make money on the internet, tutoring, make something and sell it on your spare time. I too am a full time student and I deal with rent, bills, plus my cat. I do have occasional support from my parents, but it’s still mostly my money. Save enough this summer to rent a room somewhere, and then move to a small apartment. Leave them asap, because that’s a toxic situation no matter whose fault it is. 

I will keep my YTA stand simply because they live there, and you don’t, and we don’t have their perspective on this. But it doesn’t matter. Leave for your own good."
AmItheAsshole,ewr1fra,t3_cpqmjg,1565689967.0,"You and them are clearly having lots of issues, and neither I nor anyone in the comment section can tell for sure if you’re TA or not because you’re very biased and we haven’t heard the other side of the story. 

What I will say though is that it’s their house, and it’s not fair for you to create conflict because you aren’t satisfied with the way they keep their property. Don’t like it, leave it, simple as that. 

When I was under my parents roof I had to abide by their rules, and it’s the same here. You don’t pay the bills to leave the lights in the living room on, you don’t pay the bill to use their gas or electricity to cook your meals or to keep your food in their fridge, you don’t help out in anyway inside that house, yet you’re constantly criticising them. You can either do the same as teenagers do and follow their rules without complaining, or leave them the hell alone. 

Again, I don’t know whose fault it is, but based alone on what you described and your behaviour, YTA. (but less of an asshole than last time, so good for you!)"

relationship_advice,ewjxvkr,t1_ewjw7et,1565473710.0,"I’m in a LDR myself and have recently been raped, so I was very interested in having this discussion. 

I’m not sure how you or her will proceed given all the difficulties you’ll have to face, but it certainly helps if you are patient. I honestly cannot see a foreseeable future where I enjoy sex like I did before, but my boyfriend has told me that’s not an issue and we can work on it with baby steps until I’m more comfortable. It’s not gonna happen super fast, and you have to be aware of that, but I think and hope it’s possible to heal from this. 

I’m very glad you considered what I said and you still think this can work, it gives me hope as well. And as for finding a therapist there, I wish I could help. What you can do is read about it extensively (how to help her help herself, how to talk to her in a non-aggressive way, how to support her in the little things, etc) and work on being a good partner. 

Good luck!"
relationship_advice,ewjun1a,t3_cogjfs,1565472211.0,"I think you need to prioritise her issues in this situation. Being raped is an extremely traumatic experience and it seems she hasn’t had the chance to fully heal yet. Also, trusting someone after being raped is a big challenge, since you were essentially betrayed, especially in a place like South Africa where this is a very common occurrence and there’s not that many people to support her. These are such traumatic experiences they cause a specific type of PTSD called RTS (rape trauma syndrome). The fact that she’s already been open with you about her issues is a big deal. 

Now, I see how you could get hurt if you have a fragile self-esteem, but you need to understand there’s a different level of severity between both your issues, and hers is way harder to deal with. If she’s willing to work her issues out, you should be able to work on yours too. If you aren’t or think it’s not worth it, then this relationship, that already carries many obstacles, isn’t worth it either. 

I’m not trying to judge you, not everyone is cut out to deal with that kind of baggage, but maybe you should reevaluate your priorities and see if this even has a chance to work."

He probably didn’t get what you wanted him to do since you were not direct before snapping, but the mother should have explained the situation to the kid and handled it herself. You’re not supposed to know how to parent if you’re not a parent, to me that’s quite obvious. 

Kid was just oblivious, you were just trying to give your cat a better environment. The mother is TA for not handling her child."
relationship_advice,evvsqd1,t3_cljoe2,1564846390.0,"Jesus fucking christ. 

Alright, first of all, get your shit together. Watch a couple videos from youtube and read some wikihows on how to clean and cook easy nutritious meals on a budget. You’re not that pregnant yet and you will have to learn all of this anyway for when your child arrives, so suck it up and do it. 

Go to a bank and open a joint account, and ask your parents/ his bosses to transfer his payment to said account every month. Sit down together with him and list things you have to buy every month and how much they cost so you have a fixed budget. Don’t forget to save a bit of money every month for baby things, because you’re gonna spend more once you it arrives. 

Stop yelling. Calm yourself down before discussing whatever issues you and him are having, because disrespect will only hurt you both. Work on not cussing and speaking in a low voice because if you do yell once the baby comes, you’ll be up all night trying to put it back to sleep. 

Also, consider abortion, adoption, or giving it to one of your parents, because I pity the child who has to grow up in this home environment. Consider an annulment as well, because getting married just because you’re pregnant rarely ever works out, and most likely than not will end up with one of you bailing."
