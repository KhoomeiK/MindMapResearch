bipolar,fnau7jv,t3_g09n1x,1586803904.0,"1st episode when I was in college: I thought that an invention that I was working on was going to change the world. I thought that the government found out and was after me, eventually I was taken to the hospital and then I thought I was being initiated into a secret society that controlled the world. I figured out that all the people who ran the world were disguised as homeless people so that they could communicate and move around freely. I thought that random trash on the ground were secret messages to me. Eventually, I was taken to an ER and put in a secure room with the plastic bed, rubber mattress, camera and a reinforced small glass window in the door. I thought at this time that my initiation was starting so I was supposed to escape. I blocked the window with the mattress, put my clothes over the camera, and tried to unscrew the air vent in the ceiling with a syringe cap that was on the ground. It didn't work. A few minutes into my escape attempt some police and a nurse came in and wrestled me down to give me a shot. I woke up strapped to a gurney with leather restraints. Then they found a bed for me upstairs in the psych unit.  

That was just my first episode, I could go on all day about weird shit I believed while manic. Some of the highlights are: I could communicate with my passed away relatives through insects, I knew when and where Jesus was coming back so I bought a super expensive ticket for a flight to an obscure Eastern European city (luckily I got hospitalized before that trip), songs on the radio and tv shows were directly communicating to me about the homeless-secret society, and more.  

It is so weird looking back at some of the things that I have thought while manic, it is hard to describe what it is like to people who haven't been through something similar. It is almost like you are in that movie the The Truman Show but you figured it out. Then once the anti-psychotics start working you realize you were wrong."

For me accepting that I have it and have to deal with it was a turning point for me. Prior to that I was just in a state of self pity as a result of manic and depressive episodes.

I have it is better than I am it, at least in my opinion."
bipolar,fmw5g5c,t3_fxn85p,1586439944.0,"I would listen to your Dr over your mother, they should know more about it.

I take a mood stabilizer, sleeping pill, two antipsychotics, and adderall. I am fully functional and have built a good life for myself in the last 7 years of being stable. It took years and a lot of trial and error to figure out what the right medications were for me, and we fine tune them every once in a while, but they keep me sane and functional.

For me taking a bunch of pills is worth it to stay sane. My Dr knows a lot about them and how they work so I trust him and work with him and do what he says. I have stopped taking the pills like I was supposed to in the past with other Dr's and it did not end well (involuntary commitments because mania).

Don't give up hope, it can get better, just takes a while and some pills:)"
bipolar,fmw4o81,t3_fxnldj,1586439454.0,"It took me years to find the right med combination that keeps me functional and stable. I got manic real bad throughout the end of my college years and after I graduated. I don't have any advice on what you should take but I will share my combo and knowledge of what they do: 

  
Lamictal- keeps my mood from going too high or low, took a while to find the right dose but I think it has been a life saver for me

Abilify- Fights the mania, I am on a small dose now but I continue to take it just in case

Adderall- I don't know if I have adhd but I take it to fight the sluggishness or fog related to the other meds I take. I am not sure if my Dr would admit that is why he prescribes it to me, but to me that is what it does and it helps

Zyprexa- I take it at night about a hour before bed. My wife and I call it my ""I don't care pill"" it makes me kind of zone out and slows down my thinking

Temazepam- I call that one my knock out. I take it going to bed and it helps me sleep.

I just started Ativan because I asked my Dr for something that would calm me down from the stress I have been going through recently

Looking at this, I realize that I am on a lot of psychotropic drugs. But, I have been stable for many years now and am better off mentally than I was pre-diagnosis.

It is possible to have a great life despite being bipolar, I can say that because that has been my experience. It sucked for a while, but I made it through and now am better. It sucks that I have to take a bunch of pills everyday, but in the big scheme of things it is not that big of a deal. It helps that I have a Dr that is pretty liberal with prescribing medications, but now that we found a good combo it is easy to fine tune dosages to keep me level."

As far as when to tell during relationships, I told a few in the beginning and it didn't go well. Some people are scared of what they don't understand and mental illness is a big one of those. I waited a while, over a month to tell my now wife that I have been married to for a few years. I wanted her to be able to get to know me for who I was before I dropped the b bomb. It turned out that it wasn't a deal breaker with her because she knew I was so much more than my diagnosis."

Fast forward a decade, now I am married, employed, own my own house without their help, but most importantly happy and stable most of the time.

I still have minor ups and downs, but they are not nearly as bad as they used to be. You would be hard pressed to even know I have bipolar disorder anymore unless you saw all of the pills I take every day. I do worry about the future from time to time, and what will happen if I have another episode, but I don't let that fear consume me anymore.

It can get better if you give it time and some work. I know from experience."
BipolarReddit,f9jsqsj,t3_e5gt8q,1575384825.0,To me it sounds like a motivation problem. I don't think that lacking motivation and not knowing what you want to do is a mental illness. A lot of people are like that who aren't bipolar.
bipolar,f8qitjp,t1_f8q8f9o,1574718464.0,"It is kind of hard to describe. I have never had the best memory, but after I did it I think my long term memory seemed more limited for a while. I can not remember much around the time when I did it, and my short term memory around that time and a while after was not as good. For example I had a harder time recalling customers names for a while. But it is not at all like I woke up and didn't know who my parents or friends were or where I was.

I was able to go back to work right after it though sometimes just the day after the procedure. I think if you write stuff down you will remember it, I don't see why it would affect that.

It is a pretty extreme procedure, but like I said, I guess it worked for me. It is not super painful other than the cold feeling from the anesthesia going into your veins and a pretty bad headache the day of when you wake up.

The good news is now my memory is as good as it ever was. My short term memory is back to normal. My long term memories might be a little faded, but to me that is not the end of the world, I can usually recall stuff when people bring it up or I see photographs."

I have tried thinking my way out of mania before and it did not work out well.

I would rather take care of myself physically and medically than risk loosing my wife, relationships, house, vehicles (I destroyed one while manic), and everything else I have worked so hard for in my recovery.

I will admit that it was neat to know that god was talking to me through signs, that I was being initiated into the secret organization that controls the world, that I was going to meet Jesus during his second coming, that I could communicate with my dead relatives, and all of the other crazy bullshit that was real to me while manic.

However my behaviors due to my beautiful thoughts while experiencing MANIA put my life in danger. They destroyed relationships. They put me thousands of dollars into debt. They ruined what should have been one of the most productive periods of my life.

Being high on cocaine or tripping on mushrooms can give you beautiful thoughts too. The high wears off though, then you have to deal with the consequences. Mania is no different."

How long have you been stable?

I have been for years and everything is back to normal and getting better than it was pre-diagnosis. The further you get from the mistakes you made while manic, the easier they get to forget about. Also your friends will eventually let go of the past over time. I have rebuilt a lot of friendships that I thought were burned bridges over the years. People who care about you will stay or come back into your life and would like nothing more than to see you doing well.

I used to worry a lot about what I did and what I will do in my future because of this illness. I don't worry that much about it now after years of stability. My disease is on the back burner and I have a great future to look forward to.

bipolar,f8b54hz,t1_f88lv4b,1574427247.0,"Sure:

Lamictal- keeps my moods from swinging. I have noticed if I forget to take it that I get more emotional than when I take it. By more emotional I mean I get agitated easier, and things make me feel happier or sadder more easily. I assume that is what it does on a larger scale over time and keeps me from going manic or depressed. My Dr said it helps me regulate my moods and keeps me from going depressed.

Abilify- I am on a very small dose of it. It is supposed to keep me from going manic. I can't really describe what it does, but I know that I have more energy and am more productive with the lower dose I am on now than I used to be on the heavier doses.

Adderall- Pretty much everyone knows what it does. I used to have a hard time waking up before I started taking it and I think it helps that. I don't know if I have ADD but I asked my Dr if we could try it to help me stay focused and have more energy and he said sure. I take an XR in the morning, then I am prescribed a non time released around lunch time- I don't take the lunch one all the time unless I have a lot to do. Can't take it too late in the day or I won't be able to sleep even if I take the following two.

Zyprexa- I am prescribed that one as needed. My wife and I call it my don't care medicine. If I am feeling wound up at night when it is approaching bed time and think I might have a hard time winding down, I'll take a half of one or a full one. It literally makes my thoughts slow down and kind of forget about whatever is going through my head. It wears off by the time I wake up.

Temazepam- I call this one my knock out. I only take it when I get in bed because usually makes me go to sleep pretty fast. The downside of this one is I think I am pretty much dependent on it. A lot of the literature on it says you are only supposed to take it for like a week or you could get dependent. I have been taking it for a couple of years and I can tell you if I forget to take it, I can forget about sleeping that night.

If I start feeling a little up or down for a couple of days or start seeing multiple red flags that I could be heading towards an episode, I will call my Dr and he will tweak the doses. Most of the time it is simply upping the Abilify or taking the Zyprexa full dose for a couple of nights and that usually works."
bipolar,f8b45lv,t1_f88ues6,1574426268.0,"My weight fluctuates, but I don't think that is has much to do with the meds at all. If I exercise and eat well I stay in pretty good shape.

That might seem like a lot of meds to be on, but I have been on pretty much all of the other ones at one point or another.

bipolar,f883j4e,t3_dzd6nq,1574347919.0,"Anything creative. You say no painting or drawing, you might be shit at those now but you will get better if you try.

If you really can't think of anything creative to do, pick up exercise. Get a bike or some running shoes and hit the road. Get a cheap kayak and paddle. Join a gym if that is fun to you.

If you are too lazy to exercise try fishing or hunting, those take little physical effort, but I have found them very enjoyable because it feels good to reconnect with nature. I especially like fishing and you can get into it for not much money.

If you are anti all of those things read.

All of the above are constructive and can give you a sense of accomplishment, at the very least they will give you more of a sense of accomplishment than binge watching netflix or wasting time on the internet. That has been my experience at least."
bipolar,f882fm7,t3_dzk1y1,1574347335.0,"I did it outpatient, it wasn't that bad. I can't remember how long it took to actually get it scheduled (I don't remember much from that time period maybe because of the ECT but it was years ago). I know I had to get a physical before they approved me to do it.

Basically I went into the outpatient place at the hospital where they do it a couple of times a week for a few weeks early in the morning to get it done. I would get there, wait in the lobby for a bit, then go back to a room where I put a gown on and they hooked an IV up to my arm. I would wait like that for maybe an hour, then they rolled my bed back to the room where they do it. Next, they hooked the wires up to my head, put a mask on me that had some kind of anesthetic that would make me feel loopy, then injected something into my IV that felt like ice in my veins for a second.

After that I woke up back in the room I started with a headache, waited like an hour then went and got lunch and went home. I was even able to work the next day if I wanted to. If the hospital that you would have to go inpatient is that bad, I imagine that outpatient would be a lot better if you can make it that long. I think it would be a lot less stressful to do the outpatient from my experiences with it and being committed prior.

On a side note, it was a tough decision to do it. In my case it was pretty much a last ditch effort because nothing else worked. I guess it worked really well for me because I came out of my depression and have not had an episode (manic or depressive) since. It has been over 6 years since I did it, I took my medications religiously since I did it and I think that is a big part of my recovery as well.

bipolar,f3ttobx,t1_f3r6x4i,1571145827.0,"I have learned a lot in my journey with bipolar disorder. Some major things that helped were:

Take the meds like the Dr tells you, be honest with him, take them like you are supposed to, take them like you are supposed to. Seriously though, it is easy to blame things like feeling like a zombie, gaining weight, etc. on the meds, stop taking them, then wonder why you are not getting better. A lot of people on this forum do that, myself included (in the past). If you are serious about getting better, you need to be patient and give them time to work. If you are not happy with a side effect, for example gaining weight, stop blaming the medicine, get off your ass and workout and eat healthy. Another example, if you feel like an emotionless zombie, at least you are not manic! If you stay not manic you can work with the Dr to get on a lower dose so you do not feel that way but stay not manic.

Talk therapy has helped me. I have had a lot of different therapist, but eventually I found one that seemed to have some good ideas on how I could take small steps to improve my life. I have been seeing her for years now and have appointments every couple of months to check in. It is beneficial to have the input of an outside third party professional in this stuff help you work through situations that can make your life better (and avoid ones that will make it worse). If you take their advice and take any small step in the right direction, you are moving forward and that is a good thing, eventually if you take enough small steps you will move into recovery.

I had electroconvulsive therapy. I am hesitant to recommend that because it is a pretty big deal. It effected my memory for a while (I think) but I would do it again in a life or death depression situation. Looking back it must have helped me, but it also could have just been that after I did it, I decided to take the medicine like I was supposed to, so I can't really be sure.

Exercise. If you start exercising it is good for your overall health, and it can make you get in shape and make you feel better about yourself. I was fat, blamed the medication, then I started to run and lost some weight, in turn felt better about myself which led to more confidence and more successful in the dating game.

Stay on a schedule. Pretty self explanatory but sticking to a strict sleep schedule works. It also lets you know if you are moving towards an episode so you can address it before you have one. Sleeping too much for me means going towards depression, staying up late means mania.

Try to be social even if you don't feel like it, having friends (even not close ones) makes life better.

Pick up a creative hobby. When you are doing something you like to do, it takes your mind off what you are struggling with. If it is something artistic you will also have a cool product at the end that you can feel good about.

Those are some examples of what worked for me. Some things that didn't help were: Transcranial magnetic stimulation- it was super expensive and didn't work for me. Again I wasn't taking the meds like I was supposed to so maybe it does work, but it didn't help me. Applying for disability- I almost was to the point of doing it, but I am glad I did not. Getting a job helped me get to the point where I could move out of my parents house, which made me feel better about my situation.

Hope that helps."

bipolar,f3qgyxb,t3_dhqz7y,1571074538.0,"Hey buddy I was in your shoes when I was 24. Back then I was in and out of psych wards due to manic episodes, then I would get the suicidal depression that followed for months on end, you know the drill. That pattern started when I was around 21 and had my first breakdown and continued until my mid-to-late-twenties when something changed. After my last manic episode I was at the end of my rope with the following depressive one to the point where I got ECT because I couldn't pull out of the depression with medications alone. After that I figured that I would give taking the meds like I was supposed to because I tried not doing that multiple times and it always ended with me getting locked up in the looney bin.

Things started to change, it was not overnight, but slowly I started getting better. I quit smoking and getting drunk out of my mind all the time (self medicating), I started exercising a little, I just in general started taking better care of myself. Whatever I was doing worked, I had some good strokes of luck, and my illness slowly started fading into the background of my life. I repaired relationships with family and friends that I thought were burnt bridges (my brother told me that they thought they lost me when they were having family meetings when I was inpatient). I made some great new friends, I had a few relationships with significant others, things were great and getting better.

I am in my thirties now and I have not been hospitalized or had a major episode since 2013. My illness has gotten way easier to manage over time. In fact it is almost like I don't have it other than having to take the medicine in the morning and at night. Since I started getting better, I have built a pretty cool life for myself, I am happily married, I have a house, new car, other material stuff that isn't that important, but most importantly I have stability and I am happy in a sustainable kind of way.

It took me a long time to get over my worries about the future and regrets over what I did in my past. It took me a long time to stop comparing myself to my peers who were ""normal"" and had great careers and stuff. But, as I got better my life got better exponentially. Now I don't worry too much about that stuff.

**To summarize:** I was normal till early twenties when I lost my mind- I was in and out of the hospital for manic episodes through my early to mid-late twenties and it was looking like I was going to end up dead by suicide, homeless, or hospitalized long term- late twenties to early thirties got better, am happy and stable.

If I can do it so can you. Let me know if you have any questions or if I can help.

It would have really helped me in my twenties to talk to someone that was doing well despite having this illness, unfortunately I didn't really find that in support groups etc."

If you are just coming down from a manic episode, feeling anhedonic would be expected because after manic episodes depression is expected. The idea is to take the anti-psychotics to get rid of the mania, take them through the following depression episode so you don't get manic again, then keep taking them until you are stabilized out of that so you do not have another upswing."
BipolarReddit,f1bc1n0,t3_d8kgwx,1569330600.0,"I had my first manic episode when I was around your age. I thought I was ""special"" smartest in the world, god was communicating to me, secret societies control the world but I figured it out, etc. It is normal to go from the manic episode to depression (which meant for me; wanted to isolate, antisocial, loss of all interest, etc.). I took the medicine for a while, then changed my dosages without telling my Dr, then quit taking them, then ended up having a manic episode again. That happened multiple times to me, I denied that I have this illness, and almost let it destroyed me.

Over the next probably 8 years, most of my twenties, I was on a roller coaster that peaked with involuntary commitments to the mental hospital because of manic episodes, then transitioned into depression where I thought about suicide all day every day.

BUT, eventually I got better.

Now life is good, I have not had an episode in like 6 years. In those 6 years, I have kept a job, I met my now wife, I rebuilt relationships with friends and family that I thought were burnt bridges, and I am happy. I own my home, have a new car, and material stuff that isn't that important, but I want to let you know that it is possible to recover from this illness and thrive. If I can do it so can you.

You asked for advice so I am going to give it (this is what helped me):

Accept your diagnosis- I did not start to get better until I accepted that there was something wrong with me and that it was going to be up to me to manage it, my life literally depended on it.

Take the medications- I struggled with taking meds like I was supposed to for years. I blamed a lot of my problems on them, like saying I was tired because of side effects, no feelings, gaining weight, etc.

Take care of yourself- I drank a lot for a long time, did illegal drugs some, and smoked for years. I ate shit food and did not have healthy sleep patterns. Once I worked on changing these behaviors for the better I started feeling better about myself and my condition got better.

Work with your Dr and therapist- If you are not mostly honest with them they can not help you.

Give the medications long enough to work right- You will not be able to tell if they are working until you have had some time of stability, it might take months or years, but it will be worth it if you find the right ""med cocktail"" that keeps you stable.

That is all I can think of right now, don't give up hope, this illness is not a death sentence and does not mean you will not have a good life. It takes a lot of time, patience, and struggling to get better, but it is possible and I can say that because it happened to me."

The sleep habit deal is a big indicator of what is going on for me just the way you described it. Another huge red flag that is a pretty good ""tell"" is my money spending habits. When I start buying a lot of stuff online that I don't really need but just want on impulse, it is a indicator that I am on a upswing.

As far as the ECT, as much as I hate to admit it, I think it did help me. I was pretty much depressed to the point of being a danger to myself and I had tried all kinds of anti-depressants to combat it. I did some research about it online, brought it up with my doctor and we decided to give it a try. It was not an easy decision, but more of a last ditch effort to save my life. After doing it I took my medicine like I was supposed to and I have been stable since. It was pretty scary and I think it did affect my memory for a while (it is back to normal now but it might have affected it for years), but if I got to the point of being suicidal due to depression, I would do it again.

BipolarSOs,f17kl34,t1_f15uxa6,1569244368.0,"Yeah some things that helped were:

Getting on a pretty regular sleep schedule, I have to take medicine to sleep, but staying up all night or waking up with a ton of energy can be a red flag that I am going up. On the other hand sleeping too much or not wanting to get out of bed can be a sign of depression.

Exercise regularly, I got a bike and some running shoes and got into shape. It gave me a reason to stop smoking and I got into better shape physically and lost some weight which boosted my self confidence. Exercise also had a calming effect and gave me a distraction from my sorrows.

Stopped drinking as much and doing drugs (the illegal kind), I am not sure if I am an alcoholic but I used to drink a lot to suppress my bad feelings. I still drink occasionally but not nearly as much these days.

I took up some constructive hobbies like painting, it distracts me from whatever I am going through, and I get a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment when I finish a painting.

As much as I hate to admit it, one of the biggest components of me staying well is me taking my medicine. I have to take a mood stabilizer (lamictal), anti-psychotic (abilify), sleeping pill (temazepam), and adderall (I am not sure if I have ADD, but it helps counter the sluggishness associated with the other medicines, which is why my Dr lets me take it...I think). If I would have taken the medicines like I was supposed to from the get go of having this illness, I would have probably saved myself from years of going manic to the point of hospitalization and crippling depression.

It can be scary to think that you are going to have to live differently, but based on what I said above, most of the things that I do other than take the meds would be good for anyone bipolar or not.

Bipolar disorder is a terrible illness, it destroys lives, families, and can end in tragedy. BUT, it can be managed to the point of it being not that big of a deal, and you can live a happy good life despite it. I can say that because I know from experience. Other than taking my medicine, it is not that big of a factor in my life anymore, I am doing better than I was pre-first manic episode that led to my diagnosis.

Once when I was committed in the hospital a social worker told me ""you might have a chance at a decent life, but only if you survive long enough.""- he was right.

BipolarReddit,evkgxzw,t3_cjiwy1,1564581338.0,"I have never experienced anything like that. I think that going catatonic can be a symptom of depression, but I am not a medical professional. It is time to seek help from one."
BipolarReddit,evkgl3c,t3_cjoyrb,1564581173.0,"Lamictal keeps me from getting depressed and having too much emotion. Abilify keeps me from going manic. Seroquel calms me down at night if I take it (it is prescribed as needed) (I call it my don't care medicine). Temazepam helps me be able to sleep. Adderall wakes me up and keeps me functional.

Looking at that it could seem like I am overmedicated. But I have been stable for going on 7 years, so I will keep popping them :)"
BipolarReddit,evkfwky,t3_cjm17f,1564580886.0,"Lamictal has been a life saver for me.

It helps me by keeping me from having manic or depressive episodes. The other medicines help too, so I am not sure exactly what part the lamictal plays, but I'll just keep taking it because the last six years of stability since starting lamictal have been awesome."
