My auntie died, she was rude and elitist. Doesnt change in death. I wasnt sad for her. Only for her daughter. But maybe you could be there for those that are grieving?"
offmychest,f6oc3qc,t3_dsarx4,1573013083.0,"Dont let yourself overthink things. That being said, it sucks that maybe your friend took your crush on a date. However if they have something you've got to support them both. They shouldnt have lied to you, but maybe they're both feeling awkward. A lie was easier. But in time they may tell you. It wont be a secret forever.

All that being said, i promise there will be someone for you. Its a big world. Take care."

Honestly, like everything you're not good at - it takes practice."
