NPD,fkads3y,t3_fhcghm,1584003369.0,"Honestly , why not? Life’s too short. If people got a problem with it they don’t HAVE to like it. In reality it’s like seeing a pretty dress and wanting to take pictures or have a little photo shoot in it or feeling yourself in an outfit. Does it have to be any different just because it’s a “wedding dress”? Hey & if & when you do get married , you already have a dress! Lol"
BPD,fkadaco,t3_fh2drc,1584002694.0,"I can’t relate a lot, sometimes I feel like I’m two different people but I love that I’m not like everyone else but still want to people please. I can never make decisions for myself I feel like I’m still a shy 11 year old sometimes. I was super quiet as a child to the point school thought I was mute. I lost all my friends because people couldnt handle my insecurities & how often I flip flopped my “personality” I keep to myself these days because I don’t trust anyone or myself anymore... too afraid to be hurt, scared of the world, shy, timid, quiet ..but the other side of me wants an adventurous life, a social one, to make my mark on the world, no problem with sarcasm and telling people off..but that part that wants to stay hidden is winning I feel like I have two people sharing one body.. it’s exhausting so I chose not to fight who I feel like being that day & I rather not have people telling me “I’m different” or “I’ve changed”. my closet is half and half it’s like 2 completely different people living in one house.. I’m conflicted with who I want to be I’ve lived and left so many personalities but I know who I am and I appreciate when people pick up on my antics.. I seek validation from others because it makes me feel noticed & wanted.. but i chose to stay alone & hidden because I hate seeking that validation been in a rough spot lately just trying to be ok with myself and that I do have “ Chamaeleon” like qualities. My therapist says my mind has just been trying to adapt to my surrounding and situation since I was a child & doesn’t really know how so my."
SuicideWatch,fep3d67,t3_eq7cod,1579311221.0,Damn. I think this in a day to day basis & everyone just tells me I’m sensitive & I need to “get with the program” sorry I don’t want to contribute to the cold bitterness of this world... don’t wanna do it
