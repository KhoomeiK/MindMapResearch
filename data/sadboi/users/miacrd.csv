HPfanfiction,fgop8re,t1_fgg7f9e,1580979777.0,I read it almost all at once. I'm mad it hasn't been updated in 12 years!
JUSTNOMIL,ffugz89,t3_ev8qha,1580241745.0,"The quote from Dr. Phil, although accurate, lets you see the kind of ""experts"" supporting this. I see nowhere saying to respect the wishes of the adult child if they have said the grandparents need to stop/no more contact.
None of that website makes sense without taking into account view of the parents... Like they are assuming 100% of the cases if because the parents are traumatised and taking it out on the kids...
And the paragraph on breakable family units is just laughable... Who'd thought breaking up because of emotional needs is better than staying in a marriage for the kids or for ""tradition and duty"" ðŸ™„"

depression,eqiop7c,t1_eqiiu1y,1560090880.0,"Yeah. And for me the hardest part is that uni turned into such a negative thing for me that I just stopped going to classes. I don't know my classmates anymore, all the people I knew have graduated or are finishing their masters, and I'm just here trudging along"
depression,eqiirei,t1_eqgd3e8,1560087777.0,"Same, I got shat on by my father when I started getting Cs in uni after being a straight A student in high school... and then I'm like at year 6 of a 3 yr degree and still not done with it. It feels like crap. I have a lot of issues around concentration and motivation."

Was it lack of study, blanks, being distracted during the test, etc... Took me a long time to realise it was so fucking demanding to not cut me some slack when I consistently had awesome grades."
TheArcana,eoqqyx4,t1_eoqfw1p,1558795724.0,Yeah I also thought the scene where they introduced Lucio as a goat was pretty cool in the original

He had a bacterial infection in his eye that had already eaten away at the retina, but fortunately with treatment he didn't have to go to surgery to remove the eye. He was also in risk of being blind on the other eye, but we were in time to save it. He absolutely hated the pomade we had to put in his eyes lol, but it was for the best!
He also had a respiratory infection that cleared away :)"

TheArcana,eonfbva,t3_bscjko,1558711116.0,Op thank you sooo much! I was going through this scene just last night and posted a screenshot here saying I would even like a CG even though it's so heartbreaking. So kudos!! It looks amazing and so raw
TheArcana,eokfw7e,t3_bs9q4l,1558653697.0,But I also kinda wanted a cg of him crying as well... Why am I such a sucker for angst
