None of us should be forced to pay that much for school when everyone in our life system thinks we're losers if we don't go to school.

But anyway, I digress. I think what you need is real-life work experience not any other degrees. My school is shitty but I get interest from prospective jobs because I started working when I was 16 and gained some good experience. For instance, Im going to school for a shitty business degree in marketing and sales but I already have a few years of marketing and sales experience on my resume from jobs that I was promoted at or that offered to help me learn something new. I also taught myself to use a few programs on Adobe creative suite. I have also helped friends make logos for their parents' companies and offered them help with learning how to us google ad words. Try learning something or gaining experience with something outside of school on your own. Experience and being a go-getter is attractive to people. My current boss told me she's so happy with me being able to teach her basic computer skills and help her work with our web designer to launch our new website that she wants to keep me for as long as I'd like to stay. She told me I always have part time work with her even when I go off and find a full time job (with benefits hopefully). This means I'll always have at least that one job to fall back on and hopefully two for extra income. Apply to 20 jobs while this covid shit is going on. Pick industries that are booming right now because there are definitely industries that are benefiting from all of this. I don't know what education or experience you have but UPS, Fedex, Johnson&Johnson, Amazon, and many more are making crazy money right now. Not everyone is suffering so try to aim for the few companies that are growing."
SuicideWatch,fnnlyxn,t1_fnf9xh5,1587095531.0,This was inspiring. Im fucking dirt poor paying to finish a shitty degree but I also have jobs lined up since I've been working since I was 16 and never stopped. Being poor sucks and having a lot of money equals nonstop work so that sucks too. Its like we have to find a perfect balance.
SuicideWatch,fnnkroq,t3_g1afy7,1587094697.0,"Im 24 going on 25 and fucked up terribly with school after grammar school. My problems are a little different and may seem small but I can assure you they feel like hell. Im currently on track to graduate in December of this year and I hate myself for having taken so long. Graduating when I'm 25, although disappointing, is not the end of the world by a long shot. I've had lifelong depression and anxiety which contributed to a lot of the learning problems and procrastination issues I struggle with. School is a daily struggle because I hate it and I go to a shitty school because it's all I could get in to. I was a smart kid but far too depressed and suicidal to give a crap about myself enough to put any effort into anything. So far I'm a big fat failure.

My parents were over protective to an extreme degree when I was young so I was never allowed outside of my house unless a friend came over. When friends did come over, my parents embarrassed me and sometimes yelled at me for no reason. When I went to high school I went to the biggest school in Illinois so I was thrown from my bedroom locked up all by myself for months on end (summer break) to a giant high school with a thousand kids in my grade alone. I used to shake, cry, and dream about dying every day. I wasn't really bullied because people have to know you exist to bully you. I was less than invisible and I purposely snuck out of every year book photo session at the beginning of every year because I was so ugly I thought I would break the camera and I didn't want there to be any record of me having existed at that school.

Even in adulthood now I notice that emotionally I am triggered very easily and can be thrown into suicidal thoughts for almost any reason. I will say one thing about suicide, depression, and giving up though:

There's always tomorrow. You can always kill yourself tomorrow, or next week, or next year. I read a poem once that said, ""Suicide is like a glowing exit sign, constantly reminding yourself that things haven't gotten quite bad enough yet."" This is my secret super power.

Jordan Petersen personally helped me keep going. He taught me that life is shit wall to wall and no one ever said that it's supposed to be good. The first thing I did to push forward was decide that life is NOT meant to be good. I gave up on life being good.

I decided a few years ago that I want to take my useless existence and squeeze something positive out of it. That's the only reason I'm here. If I can squeeze some type of meaning or positivity out of it, if my being here means that the world is pushed just a millimeter towards the good then I can die knowing that no matter how useless, ugly, lame, and stupid I was at least I was able to push the ball forward a tiny bit. Despite all my uselessness I was able to move this from ""here"" to ""there"". I don't exactly know how I will accomplish this as I am focusing on being able to just take care of myself and get my own place. I can't help anyone until I help myself. I have at least volunteered at animal shelters and fostered a few dogs and you know what? It felt damn good. Try volunteering for hospice care. I tried that too and went through my training but ended up getting a full time job around the time I finished. My thinking was that if I take care of dying people then maybe I will gain some tidbit of inspiration that I will die regardless one day and maybe should wait until it happens on its own.

I'm a loser, a fuck up, an ugly woman, I'm losing my youth, I'm not taking care of myself, and I fear that my boyfriend will up and leave me at any moment. He's my only connection to love other than my parents who have gotten better. But if he does leave me, my shitty degree never amounts to anything, I never gain meaningful friendships or do anything positive then guess what? The glowing exit sign is still there. My secret super power."
