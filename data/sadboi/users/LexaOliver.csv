Mon séjour s’est fait à 3heures de chez moi pour justement un rendez-vous avec ma psychiatre et j’en ai profité pour faire le tour des personnes que je n’avais pas vu depuis longtemps. Donc émotionnellement je pense que ça a été plus éprouvant que ce que je croyais.Comme toi je suis plutôt introverti mais j’étais tellement contente de profité des gens que j’aime que ça a occulté le fait de ne pas être dans mon cocon.

Jusqu’à hier j’avais du mal à me focaliser sur quelque chose , mais là je me suis lancé dans un projet un peu fou qui risque de beaucoup m’occuper.Alors on verra

Disons que j’ai pas mal dormi mai mais j’ai passé 4 nuits sur un canapé, ça doit jouer sur la qualité du sommeil. Et là en 3 jours j’ai dû dormir 6 ou 7 heures , je sors justement d’une nuit blanche. Alors évidemment le contre coup va être violent.

Elle m’avait prescrit du Tercian mais je déteste l’effet zombifiant du médicament et les pertes de mémoire qui vont avec .

Pour l’instant j’arrive à gérer mais je garde cette astuce sous le coude

At 11:30 you come back to nurse station for other pills and you go to the cafeteria for lunch.

At 18:30 you come back again for pills and go back to cafeteria for dinner

At 21:00 or 22:00 you come for the last time to sleep pills ans if you want you go to bed.

In the meantime between pills you have nothing to do , no activities, no distraction. Nothing. But if you have just pills at the end of the day , you are completely free of your time. If you want to go out the ward and move to town for shopping or meeting friends or take drugs. Harming yourself . You can. 
And when you return to the hospital ( in time for pills) no one ask you what you did. 

I call it a hotel because nurses or doctors or psychiatrist never come to ask you in the day if you’re ok . physically or mentally. It’s just like you rent a room with a roommate and pay for someone to give your pills or treatments. Just like you’re at home"
