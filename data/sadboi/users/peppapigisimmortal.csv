Advice,fldu8zs,t1_fldrsd2,1585071821.0,"Yeah tough situation... I wouldn't worry too much about looking like bad people to your sister, especially when your mom is the one that is being abusive/neglectful. Your sister is only 13 so although she may act very upset like she knows exactly what she is doing, she will, almost guaranteed, be thanking you later on. Your mom sounds quite narcissistic, and these types of parents usually target the younger one, because they are more easily manipulated and seeking more approval from their parents, as all children do.

 Waiting until your sister is older will not make it easier on her, she most likely will start resenting your mom as she gets older, as you have. It might not seem fair to her right now, but protecting your little sister is very important. I can't tell you whether to go to court or not, that is for you and your dad to decide, but what it would do is set very clear boundaries for your mom to not overstep--it would not prevent all contact from her (unless that is what you want). In the long run it may be healthier for all, although in the short term it will be very dramatic for the family."
Advice,fldrbtf,t1_fldqcnk,1585070196.0,"I see... if she stopped bringing your sister over would your dad be able to intervene? If she is abusing either of you, he should have full custody, meaning he has full control over where you two are. I believe your sister could still choose to live with her, but your mom should not be able to hold your sister hostage at a whim. Are you comfortable enough talking about this with your dad and possibly work out a situation where you do not have to see her, but your sister is still able if she chooses to? Like maybe as simple as, he could pick her up instead of your mom dropping her off?
Your sister may be a little too young to understand the full extent of your mom's behavior."
Advice,fldq5du,t1_fldpvpl,1585069540.0,"Does your sister live with her or with your dad? Does she feel similar to you, or is she close with your mom?"
Advice,fldpig5,t3_fo7wbl,1585069178.0,"Damn I feel you. I have been in a similar situation, with the alcohol, the abuse, neglect, and being forced to go there by a dad that does not understand or care how bad it is.
When I first cut off contact with my mom, I felt extremely guilty, but that will wear off with time. What I did was write a letter, explaining how I was feeling and why I was cutting off contact. Do not be unnecessarily mean or try to shame her. But do be very honest by how hurt you are by her and how it is best for your health and safety to not see her.
Then, block her phone number and any other way she can contact you. Then, give yourself time to heal. Go see a therapist about it, if at all possible. These psychological wounds will not heal on their own, but it is a start to get away from the person inflicting them. After six months or so, you will be able to reevaluate the situation with your mom, eventually you can make a phone call, and slowly rebuild your relationship with her. Of course this may not be possible, so then you can just add on whatever interaction you can handle, whether it is phone calls every few weeks, seeing her twice a year (or still no contact). Most importantly, DO NOT feel shame for this, even when she tells everyone you don't love her, or if your family gives you shit you for it. Do not feel bad for taking care of your own needs, ever. She is the parent, not you. ( also, make sure your sister is safe as well, in case your mom lashes out at someone else!)"
