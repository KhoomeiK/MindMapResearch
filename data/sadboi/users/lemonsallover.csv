The only weird thing is that I was on Adderall for A half a year before I took a break and while I had head rushes, they’ve never been even remotely like this. I also smoke and drink n used psychedelics occasionally but haven’t in a while"
Drugs,fp9qjjy,t1_fokj4hd,1588432434.0,"I took it almost every day throughout most of the day to keep up with a rigorous class schedule. I was completely fine for about five months. Gradually, I started getting really really depressed and generally scared. nothing could make me feel better, I had no idea what was going on so I blamed my friends and my family. It wasn’t until my boyfriend broke up with me that I realized this was something chemical. my symptoms aligned w adderall overuse, so I stopped taking it completely. I was dangerously depressed for about eight months before I started feeling better, but I had a check up with my doctor and explained what happened and they told me that Adderall doesn’t affect people like that. I dove into hours of research trying to figure out what was happening, and extreme sleep deprivation (causing mild forms of brain damage), Had every single symptom, even the little details. Anyways, it definitely was a result of getting horrible sleep for many months on end, BUT for me specifically, I learned probably a year later that I had bipolar 2 disorder (more subtle than regular bipolar), which affects The way Adderall processes in your system (triggering the “ups” and inevitably resulting in a huge “down”). this is really specific to me, but if you find yourself being paranoid/thrown from Adderall, sometimes it’s minor mental things you might have that changes the way Adderall is supposed to function. I don’t think you have psychosis, but unless you’re taking a big dose (15mg is pretty normal), it shouldn’t be making you as paranoid as you are.

i’m pretty sure you’re fine but it’s something to pay attention too. Our situations are very different, but I hope that helped!"

ive never heard of another person freaking out about their wardrobe and you’re totally right, it is the choices. 

and EARPLUGS, that’s genius!! it feels almost like the white noise gets louder than actual sounds and its so overwhelming—will definitely use that idea. 

timing/routines/missing classes are all things im very inconsistent with. i had never thought of my sensitive bouts being correlated to specific times of the day, so itll be interesting to see if there are any major trends. ive been struggling with a pretty severe depression recently, so thats a huge factor in getting things done on time/missing classes as well, but hopefully when things get better i can pay attention to using efficiency devices like yours. 

thank you so much for all of this! im so happy to make sense of these frustrating moments and actually relate to someone similar."

depression,fa25tpc,t3_e7g750,1575778178.0,"move to the bay area! easier said than done ofc but if at some point in your life you get the opportunity to live somewhere else, the culture has such a small regard for gender normalities, ESPECIALLY in their school systems. I go to high school around here and atleast a 2 or 3 guys openly wear makeup & probably 70% of the people I know identify as bisexual. obviously it’s not perfect, but its safe (mostly). like I said, moving is extremely hard, but I think being able to live according to your actual identity is one of the most important priorities for living happily."

depression,f9w08fi,t3_e754hd,1575684499.0,"hey I just wanted to ask if you were on any medication/poor health habits because a few months ago I had the need to cry and then instead of it stopping after 20 minutes or so, it would just keep going on and on, like, for eight hour stretches of time. I later learned that I was suffering from severe exhaustion that basically fucked up my brain because I was on some ADHD meds that kept me awake for longer. it just didn’t seem possible to me that being well rested would solve my bouts of absolute helplessness, and I didn’t believe it at first, but I started sleeping more often and I’ve somehow gotten a lot better. I don’t ever feel like that anymore, and I honestly never thought I would ever get rid of that feeling.

this specifically might not apply to you, but I guess my point is that your physical condition could 100% relate to your mental condition if you can’t stop feeling bad like that. keep us posted id love to hear more/u can hmu if you get like this again."
