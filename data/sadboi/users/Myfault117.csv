philosophy,fplo9nq,t3_ge1dbg,1588716341.0,"I think it's the wrong question to ask. Maybe that we have a society that's so hell bent on competition and ranking of all aspects that it forces kids to use drugs illicitly to gain an edge.
Such high levels of stress and anxiety over multiple generations will cause societal burn out. Just look at the humor expressed by the 2 youngest generations, memes about constant depression, anxiety as well as casual suicide. Comparison is the killer of joy. Yes I dont think it was absent in past generations, it was either not talked about or handle in the community.  Now we have 40 percent of people that will suffer in the US alone that will experience chronic ""Aloneness"" which is revealed to have multiple health effects on our bodies such as higher susceptibility to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc....  More people feel alone than ever when there is more people in the world than ever. If that isn't irony, then I do not know what is. It's all game theory of a zero-sum game, if everyone plays fair everyone progresses faster. If few cheat they will gain advantages at the expense of the ones who do not. This causes more to cheat to want the same advantages, but when everyone cheats progress is halted completely.  This is the our entire Modern civilization."

All i see is masks too, like this advertisement for how they think others should see them as. I had to go back on medication as well and that too was the biggest stigma. If I'm not perfect every moment its ""Do you need your meds again?"" even from those closest to me.    

I've been on meds since 5 or 6 , really dont remember life before it. I went off them in the last year for the first time and for a while I was able to feel these flooding of repressed emotion in everything i did. I thought I could see the horizon,  but alas. the depression is swallowing me up again and with it the pressures from others to take meds.  

Not everyone is wearing a mask  dont get lost in the generalizations of the fakes. we aren't all like that. I know it's hard because I'm caught it the generalizations too but trying my hardest to give every new person respect and no biases. It can be extremely tiring though.  Keep Strong
