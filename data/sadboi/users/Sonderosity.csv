Social support, exercise, nature, CBT, job, volunteer, less/no alcohol, etc) but sometimes it really is a chemical thing. Using antidepressants is stigmatized, and unfortunately I even have a bias against it even though I have found that it truly did make a difference when doing everything ""right"" still didn't work and I felt i was going crazy. I think psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca etc can help but there's little scientific research and good luck getting a Rx for those. usually there are many different stressors for depression and it  is often a symptom of other disorders, often anxiety disorders. I didn't want the drugs to help me but they did, so don't discount the advice of your doc if they recommend it."

You're right, I do need a therapist and do have one that I have been seeing for a long time, but he has been away for the holidays for now. I am also seeing a psychiatrist for antidepressants and have greatly reduced my alcoholism and smoking (yes I know I said i was drunk in the OP but it is no longer a nightly or even weekly thing) . I don't think there is any way for someone else to help me unless they have been through this but how common is that? The strength needs to come from within. i have been considering detransition for the last 2 years (more or less) so this is not a sudden exasperated reaction; but since there have been some real blows to my self-confidence recently there is a paralysis of action from doubt and fear of loss and failure."

I struggle with depression and self-hatred but have recovered from my severe anorexia that was a symptom of my self-loathing and it was a dark, dark time. I wanted to starve to death and  had a morbid curiosity as to how far I could take it before it took me.

It spiraled out of control. I used to be athletic, but could no longer run, or even walk up an incline. I could never get warm. My brain was out of fuel and I failed two classes. I would accidentally piss myself because the pelvic floor muscles had atrophied. And recovery, when i finally regained the will to live through A LOT of social support, was a BITCH. I think it would have been much easier if I didn't let it go that far.

Please get help before it spirals. There is something deeper here that you need to deal with. I'm still struggling and working on my issues, but the ED was so traumatic that I will never go back to that as a coping mechanism. Like smoking, just don't do it!

Eating disorders are mental illnesses- a binger can be underweight, an anorexic/bulimic may be overweight. The issues often cause weight changes and fluctuations but depending on where your baseline is plus the clothes you're wearing (a lot of us tend to use baggy clothes to hide ourselves) people may not realize there is a problem just at first glance. You should never feel bad about enjoying a meal, even a sumptuous one once in a while. It's your body image issues that needs work. I have the same problem it is called body dysmorphia. And if ballet is very triggering for you then you may want to consider taking a hiatus for a bit to focus on your mental health.

 Edit: I also ended up failing 2 classes because I was so consumed by it and it affected my brain functioning (no fuel).

 Please get help before it spirals out of control. 

Personally, seeing a nutritionist and therapist one-on-one was very helpful for me, the group outpatient program i was originally placed into was very focused on numbers and made me even worse to the point they sent me to the hospital. Looking back i think it was silly of them to run their program that way with a disease that is very much an obsession with numbers."

Maybe some rules could be: 
1.No sweeping or exaggerated statements 
2.No slurs , name-calling or shaming 
3.controversial assertions should be backed by sources and presented respectfully

I hope the folks there are sincere and supportive and that it isn't filled with ""gender critical"" types...but as I'm looking through, there does seem to be some fear mongering there around hormones. This is a discussion that needs to happen, and people who are confused about gender after transition should have a place to find support without judgment from trans or anti-trans extremists.

As with regards to your question- I wouldn't jump into hormones/surgery until you're 100% sure. Testosterone is a hell of a drug, and there's certain irreversible changes that happened to me that I regret. It isn't dangerous, but definitely make sure you're completely fine with voice deepening, body hair (everywhere including weird places like shoulders) maybe oilier skin/male pattern baldness if that's in your family, etc. And you probably don't want to get top surgery until you have been on T a while and your breasts shrink a bit, maybe make sure you're not overweight for optimal results. For the slimmer guys, a lot of them don't even look like they even had surgery! My therapist challenges me with this question: is your reason for wanting to transition (or in my case, detransition) coming from internal or external pressures? For example, do you just feel right as a man, or are you fed up with being a woman because sometimes society is shitty with sexual harassment, not being taken seriously, etc. For men and for women, there are societal pressures and expectations. So to transition, you're trading one type of pressure for another, in my case I find male pressure to be in some cases harder than what I endured as a female. It's tricky. But definitely don't start any medical stuff until you have presented as male for a while, and see how it feels. And see a gender therapist too. I wish you the best of luck, friend!"

You say it's understandable that some may detransition due to stress but is that ever the right reason- meaning, won't it lead to regret later on?

Your comment is interesting to me because most trans people I've met feel the opposite way- that they wish they had transitioned sooner (not that they are bitter about it). However i have been struggling these past 3 years with an internal battle of whether I'm truly trans and highly envious and bitter of cisgender people- a lot of it has to do with coming to terms with past trauma and brainwashing when i was younger. 
I find that I regret transition, but do not want to send the wrong message to other trans people who ARE legitimate, and I certainly can't talk to cisgender people who will just use me as an example of the dangers of the ""trans agenda"".
