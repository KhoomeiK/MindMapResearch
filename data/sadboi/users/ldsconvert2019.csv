box that was checked for me. I seen a place I can live out the Gospel. The Book of Mormon was not something I accepted, but when I opened up to the possibility about its truth and started reading and learning and learned about Prophets (looking up the definition in the dictionary helped, they are simple men who speak the will of
God, they are not perfect, and basically what do pastors in church do on Sunday in my old
church anyway?) 
I had a choice to move forward or reject outright. At that time I was thinking I would not worry about the temple thing, or baptisms for past relatives , I would try to just be a good follower of
Christ. After my baptism, the spirt moved me so much and a month later I was at the temple. My faith is incredible today, the gifts that have appeared have been unexpected and amazing since
joining. Life can have so many blessings, the world twists us in so many ways, we have to slowly untwist. 

If you asked me a couple years ago I would have laughed in your face if
you said I would be a member of the church. Today, I can’t see it any other way. I looked at the good and the bad and the ugly, and everything points to Christ. Members of the church still have problems, they sin, they are human beings.Get to know the missionaries, we are average folks from all backgrounds. I mean, if you life doesn’t change for the better in a year, you can always go back to what you are doing now, but I know
you will find many blessings. Just invite the spirit in, you are not
putting your head on the chopping block, open the door a little bit and let
the sun shine in."
