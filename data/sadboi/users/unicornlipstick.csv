It creates more work for everyone involved and then the person has to wait even longer to even know if they'll get a refund when you can just message the company first."

You don't need a relationship with this person, maybe avoid the place she works for a few months if you feel it necessary to avoid conflict. That baby is yours and clearly needs your protection. You and the shelter did what was required and this other person failed to take action and will now have to suffer the consequences - which isn't your fault at all."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ephzhtt,t1_ephaoi4,1559232902.0,"My sister did it once as a threat to me while my mom was taking a nap. She dialed, heard it ring, and immediately hung up thinking she just scared me. Sure enough they call back and I want nothing to do with that so it goes to the machine where they say they've dispatched someone to be there soon. I panic and wake my mom up - to which she responds that ***I*** have to call back to cancel it. I got scolded by the dispatcher who did not at all believe my story and kept me on the phone for what I remember being a long time talking about the seriousness of false alarms. I don't think my sister ever got into any trouble for it, either.

relationships,epe3pdx,t3_bumuax,1559178144.0,"If you feel bad about the cost, offer to help pay. Or she might want to keep you which would be a different situation, as maybe you two can remain friends. But this wedding is still way far off, and if you're unhappy, that's all you need to be concerned about. She'll have plenty of time to figure things out. I'm sorry you're going through this and wish you the best of luck."
relationship_advice,epe1oz4,t3_bumlbs,1559177503.0,"Is there any chance he might have knowingly edited your part out because he didn't want you to see it yet? Just trying to look at all sides. Then there's the chance he might not have even thought to include you, which would suck, but sometimes people just forget things or don't think certain things would be as important as they are. So maybe he didn't intentionally leave you out. Don't feel bad for having an emotional response to that, you're allowed to feel things. But I feel like the only way you're gonna feel any resolution is by communicating as openly as possible with him. Let him know you want to have an open discussion and don't come at him in an accusatory way, otherwise it might just fester and you'll end up taking it out on him in other ways."

Advice,epbohbn,t1_epanugj,1559145176.0,"This is SO important, I hope OP reads this. Young women can be extremely mature and responsible. My younger sister is only 24 but wise beyond her years. But that doesn't change the fact that there's a lot of life to live coming up, a lot of things that you (OP) may or may not have experienced. Being her support system is vital, so even if you don't get it, be supportive and be there for her (which honestly, from this post, I get the idea that you already are - just remember there will be challenges eventually). There's no reason why a relationship with this sort of age gap can't work if both parties are understanding."
