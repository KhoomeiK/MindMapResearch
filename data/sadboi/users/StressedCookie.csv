college,fpquhb9,t3_gel6nh,1588832591.0,"From a third world country here: Choose your colleges well if you can. A lot shoot for good universities, of course, it's not bad but you need to have the ""feel"" if the university is good for you. Universities big or small have their own bad systems and administrations, but a good school is where you can still feel some respect for the students.

I used to study in a big university and hated it.
Transfered to a smaller college in a province and loved it.
Now I'm here in another ""Big"" college and hate it. 

The work load wasn't different. Teachers weren't kinder. The people weren't simple to get along with either. The difference would be the resources you COULD get like student exchange or a good university brand for your resume.

Go to your classes. Submit your stuff on time even if it's not your best work. The best way to manage your time is to have a hobby or interest close or relating to your program. It's fun and educational. Put effort in extra curricular too and learn other skills than just your major! 

I learned to speak to my professors as well with problems and questions. It doesn't really excuse my work but it's best that they have knowledge where I'm coming from like being depressed or having trouble understanding."

It's nothing new but I really feel like I need to get this off my chest. I can't discuss this with my classmates because they're apathetic, but for someone who is suffering from multiple mental disorders, I need to slow down and think about myself during this pandemic.

This is the recent post from our department head:  
Medical and Nursing students in many schools have volunteered to serve in understaffed hospitals with no pay nor assured credit to their academic requirements; Mechanical Engineering students in St. Louis University went back to their workshops to make face shields to be donated to frontliners; Fashion design students in some exclusive schools in (City name) are designing and making PPEs likewise to be donated to hospitals who are running out of supplies; Culinary and Hospitality students are cooking meals to be delivered to hospitals and centers where people were housed with nothing to eat; seminarians are working non-stop with (school name) delivering food, gift checks and other survival packages to the poorest to the poor in (City name).

My dear students, what are you doing???? Perhaps if you involve yourself in life-saving endeavors, you would not have time to complain. You just have to listen to lectures, read hand-outs, submit your outputs, but you're complaining? And what did I see online? AUTOMATIC PASS – Absolutely not! Let me explain: why (Insert University names) do it? Because to remain in those schools, to be retained in particular courses, they have to meet superlatively high standards already to begin with….in other words, the demands of these courses and universities are tough and arduous. You guys just attend online classes, complain, yet have the gall to ask for automatic pass??

There are several points I have to say about this statement, but I can't articulate myself well enough. In our department, people weren't pushing for automatic passes. We wanted to postpone online classes since it's being proven that it's not an effective method.  
I came from a University before transferring to this school and with the way, they said that this school isn't up to par with quality education. I'm wondering why am I even here? There's not a lot of difference with our workload and university workloads, but there's a lot of difference in opportunities.  
Why do I feel invalidated because I'm not in the front lines?"
