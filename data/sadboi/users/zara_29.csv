RBNLifeSkills,fkcj4au,t3_fhoelm,1584054168.0,"I used to - and still do - struggle with this. I find it helpful to try and self praise any time I ‚Äòaccomplish‚Äô something. Even if it feels superficial and forced when I did it, slowly my mentality changed. I actually started to feel proud of myself for things. Sometimes I still feel mediocre but the feeling comes less often nowadays. I know it‚Äôs not much, but I hope it helps."

stata,fj5arlj,t1_fj5a4wu,1583028271.0,It‚Äôs essentially finding what percentage of the data set satisfies these two variables 1. It‚Äôs a KFC and 2. It‚Äôs in New Jersey or 1. It‚Äôs a Burger King and 2. It‚Äôs poverty population is greater than 20%
stata,fj5ano1,t1_fj5a4wu,1583028201.0,"okay so there a lot as it‚Äôs quite a large table I have to fill out

So an example would be ‚Äòpercentage of KFC‚Äôs in new jersey‚Äô or ‚Äòpercentage of burger kings with a greater than 20% population in poverty‚Äô

KFC -> KFC==1 
Burger King -> BK==1

New Jersey -> NJ==1
Greater than 20% population in poverty -> greatpov20 (made this variable myself from doing prppov>0.20) 

Not sure if that helps I‚Äôm so sorry"
stata,fj593jj,t1_fj582gv,1583027139.0,"So, for example, I have a data set to work with including numbers of, for example burger kings, KFC‚Äôs etc in a specific areas, e.g New Jersey. 

So like, I need to find the percentage of, say, burger kings located in New Jersey.
Or the percentage of burger kings with a population of greater than 20% in poverty (I have created a new variable for this, I just need a way to match up how to find the percentage of the data set that satisfies both conditions, e.g both located in New Jersey and a Burger King. If that makes sense?)"
stata,fj585us,t1_fj582gv,1583026498.0,It‚Äôs definitely in STATA.. perhaps I didn‚Äôt make my question too clear ?

BPD,fe4drdw,t3_enoex6,1578858213.0,"YES I always feel this and I feel so guilty. Rationally I can understand why they can‚Äôt hang out (busy with work, family etc) but it still absolutely kills me and I fall into such a slump. Then they feel bad because they feel responsible and I feel incredibly guilty because it‚Äôs no ones fault but my own. It‚Äôs one of the things I struggle with the most."
