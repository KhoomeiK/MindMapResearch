What ""junk"", what do you think you know about vaccine development for you to blanket call it ""junk""? If it's the whole thiomersal bullshit, they A) don't use it anymore, and B) when you mix elements together you *fundamentally* change their properties. For instance, table salt is a mixture of sodium, chlorine, and iodine. If you were to bite into a block of sodium, it would explode in your mouth and tear your jaw off. When it's mixed with chlorine (which also can potentially hurt you), suddenly, it's reasonably safe, and makes food taste better.


> NOW they project that this generation of children will be the first to NOT OUTLIVE THEIR PARENTS! What does this tell you?? It tells me that people were better off and 100 years ago before they started with all the chemicals in my food or any nasty vaccines!

>This was said to be genetic at the time I was diagnosed 42 years ago. Now they say that it 8s an autoammune disease brought on by ingestion of chemicals that have been inbedded in our food!


Diseases may have multi-systemic roots. Both explanations may be true at the same time. It's also the current *theory*, of what is going on. They are not saying definitively, just that this is what *seems* to be going on, and is the best explanation based on empirical research.


> My whole immune system grows stronger every day!


You don't know that. A loss of symptoms doesn't mean your immune system is getting stronger. By that logic someone who is actively on an immunosuppressant like prednisone for an auto-immune problem paradoxically has a strong healthy normal immune system when their symptoms go away.

I was a moody teenager going through a rough patch, and as I'm crying and experiencing these emotions, I get a small pain in my left side. I stayed up the next night and played minecraft (beta 1.4ish was the newest at the time iirc) and had a coke. The next day at school, I'm in study hall, I should be studying for a test. But I'm so tired. That weird pain in my left side is back and it's worse. I'm debating with myself the choice to make, study, or nap. I nap, and the pain gets worse. I'm getting more and more tired though. I start noticing blood in my stools. Then pools of blood. I'm so tired all the damn time. I was endlessly on and off steroids for years.


As my flare ups got worse and worse, it got harder and harder to hold it in. I just could *not* control my sphincter. If I got the feeling to go, I had to go ***NOW***, or I would shit myself. Full on sprinting to the bathroom and ripping my clothes off. I've shit myself several times. A few times at school, nearly got arrested once for public defecation (don't ask), at the grocery store, and especially once when I saw my mother (npd who caused my bpd) and she started bitching at my grocery choices, at a concert, overseas. I *hate* it, the stress of shitting myself in public makes my flares worse. The constant bleeding from my intestines made it feel like I had to go all the time. So not only do I not have control over my sphincter, it keeps wanting to open up, my movements are nauseating, the stench is gag inducing, I'm wiping constantly, my anus hurts, there's blood all over the place that I have to clean up, I have to wash my hands but I'm so tired and I'm so anemic, I have this horrible stomachache, and I can't focus on my schoolwork. Oh wait I just finished up and I have to go to the bathroom. AGAIN.


I'm anxious because of bathroom availability, knowing where the bathroom is, not wanting to shit myself in public, and the stresses and anxieties of BPD just make it all that much harder. Emotions, anxiety and stress also make it worse. Got into an argument that day? Flare's gonna be worse. I was scared to eat because I was did not want to encourage more bowel movements. I was raised by a mother who always scared us with ""Ewww don't be like your father who nearly got his intestines cut out and almost had to shit out of a bag for the rest of his life."", obviously no little kid would ever WANT to have a colostomy, and I certainly didn't want one as an adult.


I was in a flare for 8 months. I was extremely sick. I dropped 60 lbs. My family was getting concerned that I was refusing to go to the hospital. My brother is a stoner and my dad was agreeing *with him* that maybe I should take marijuana, anything to get my appetite back and start fighting the flare. For my family, this is scandalous. Normally, I stress eat, I eat for pleasure, I'm usually a bottomless pit, not this time, it was a miracle my dad got me to eat some potatoes. I was surviving off gatorade and water and the rare small amount of food.


I was so miserable, and I've been passively suicidal for years. I was lying down in bed thinking, ""either this is my deathbed, or someone is gonna call the ambulance on me and I'm going to have my guts ripped out, but at this point...I really don't care"". I had started to improve at this point, not being worried about if I'll have the organ or not, and I think that helped to a significant degree. I do believe worrying about your conditions does in fact make them worse.


Mom had given me these bismuth salicylate (spelling?) tablets begrudgingly because she hates anything 'non-organic', and those did almost nothing. Dad took me over to the pharmacist and got me a bottle of Loperamide tablets. That did the trick. First time out w/ it, I still had the stomach pain, and the urges to go, but nothing came out. I *finally* went hours later at home. Subsequent uses as I got better resulted in not going for *two* days. Is the drug all that useful for the particular condition? No, in fact it's risky. Overdoing it can result in backing your guts up and getting toxic megacolon, which is a life threatening emergency. It did help me have the confidence to go outside of the house and not endlessly worry about the bathroom. I have good control over my bowels again, finally. 

All of this occurred over 7 years. When you've been this sick and pooped this much, been around your shit, and been covered in your own shit, it stops being so gross to talk about. I *strongly* recommend you talk to your therapist. If they can't handle talking about the bathroom, get another one."

BPD,fk6gu96,t3_fgrdjy,1583901788.0,"Naturally, BPD severity (and self-awareness) is dependent on the individual. I learned the lesson ""you can't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm"" in a crummy breakup. I'd offer you the same wisdom. A lot of us (myself included) have daily suicidal ideation, and enough of us get the thoughts (again, included) of metaphorically pouring gasoline everywhere and lighting the match in order to improve our perceived situation.


Your girlfriend thinks her behavior is completely fine. It's not. She is intensely insecure and hurting you to try to force you not to abandon her (being away from her for a week or two) in her perception. You need to gauge how unstable your girlfriend is. Perhaps even offer her an ultimatum. She goes to therapy or you break up with her. If you feel she is dangerous, you need to go on the defensive to protect yourself. She's already willing to give up and end her life, doesn't mean you have to as well. If this relationship is harming you, it needs to end."
BPD,fk6d74n,t3_fgiwql,1583899049.0,"Whelp, you basically told him the truth that you hate him, and you cannot take that back. I understand the feeling of emotions bubbling over for *behaviors*, but attacking his body was... not great, sister, and I'm being diplomatic about that. I'm gonna be honest, I'm not impressed with your behavior. If you dislike his self-sufficiency/job prospects, his supposed arrogance (which you seem to imply), his tastes, and his body... well, it's time to do the adult thing and break up maturely, just tell him that he's not what you're looking for in a partner, and as a gesture of good will, *why*, without demeaning him for his flaws. This should be a good learning experience for you. I hope you'll find something from it."

While we were waiting for your later show, some broad fumes out of the back of the hotel, yelling about how crass and profane you were.
