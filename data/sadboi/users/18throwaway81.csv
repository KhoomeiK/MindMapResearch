I've ended up with all sorts of odd facial hair (most regrettably I once ended up with a handlebar mustache and long bushy sideburns) and at this point there's something of a cycle to it. I'll get depressed and grow out a beard because I'm too depressed to shave, and then I'll be in some sort of a mood and shave it into a mustache or a goatee or some sort of combination of various things, and then eventually I'll go clean shaven while in some other mood, and the process repeats."

Of course at home she was very different. My best friend was the only other person who saw through her BS. He's got an nmom too so he gets it. Right away he noticed something off about her."
raisedbynarcissists,f2zvvp2,t1_f2zdpxl,1570540031.0,That's normal conversation? I always avoid it out of consideration that some people might not have parents or they might not have good parents.

BPD4BPD,f2yfazs,t3_davnoi,1570490478.0,"I'm lucky. I have a career that is very easy to claim as an identity. I'm a musician and so no matter happens I have that and that is me. Of course within that I have a bunch of identities as a flutist, a clarinetist, a saxophonist, an oboist, and a bassoonist and I tend to radically change my focus frequently. But it worked out well because now I am proficient in multiple instruments and styles that are very marketable in my area. Unfortunately I really don't have anything more to my identity than that. Sometimes people ask me what I like besides being a musician and I haven't a clue. So I have absolutely no advice and I don't know why I typed this up but here it is."

I just told him a little bit about it so he could understand some of my behaviors better, and I told him not to read up on it because there's a lot of misinformation out there. He's been great and supportive since then. Yesterday I told him about my recent suicide attempt and he told me loves me, and that I mean a lot to him, and hugged me, and told me I'm okay."
BPD,eqrr8zi,t3_bz8n0z,1560267965.0,Sometimes I like oversharing.

BPDmemes,eq7gljq,t1_epz7tp5,1559846409.0,Yeah I had never heard of BPD until that episode. It kind of ruined my perception of reality for a few days but now I'm on a path to get better thanks to that show. I'm actually rewatching it and it's so different knowing what I know about myself now.

aspiememes,epupdci,t1_epuoek9,1559513429.0,Something that helped me get more comfortable with ordering is to think the words before walking up. If it's a place I've been to before and I know what they have I'll think about what I want before I even get there and go through the words I have to say to order it in my head. If I don't know what they have I just stand back from a distance where I'm not in line but can still see until I've looked over the menu and gone through the words I have to say. Ordering food was difficult for me for a while too but it's just a set of steps to practice. It might take us longer than others to get it down but with practice it's doable.
aspiememes,epun549,t1_epumdyl,1559512286.0,Oh no that's not a pain at all for me. I love it. It's quicker and I never want to order anything different anyway. I actually have no issues ordering food anymore but it's just nice to have somewhere I can go and not even have to think through my order while I'm walking up.
BPD,eptt8bb,t3_bvz8ii,1559497113.0,DAE get made fun of frequently for something you did during a BPD episode? I made a big impulse purchase one time (that I cancelled because it was a mistake) and my friends give me shit for it all the time and they're always telling everyone we meet about it. So basically everyone in my life knows about it now. And they keep talking about it and everytime it gets brought up I freak out internally and consider killing myself.
aspiememes,ept67oy,t3_bvvdww,1559482722.0,Every day that I work I always go to the same place for lunch and order the same thing everytime.

Like on one hand I realize that it's not actually a good thing but also I want to do that anyway. I'm really awkward with everything sexual so as much as I want to have impulsive sex sometimes I can't and even though it's probably a good thing that I'm not having impulsive sex it feels bad. Sorry if what I said is hurtful to anyone that struggles with that, I know my jealousy is irrational and probably hurtful to talk about."
BPD,epi7ds1,t1_epi6fds,1559235481.0,"Yeah that's what not having a social life in high school did for me. Now I'm left with little to no friends, constantly oversharing to the few friends I do have, depression, BPD, impulsive urges to spend money I don't have on more instruments, and as a consolation prize I'm good at my job so at least I have that. Also my parents abused me when I was younger which isn't relevant at all but I just like oversharing."
BPD,epi5okc,t1_epi4b4r,1559234923.0,It sure is. I often find myself playing 5 or 6 different instruments within one show and that's something I do very well. I can play about 20 different instruments proficiently and I dabble in a few others so I don't have much of a social life but at least I have that. I'm not good at much else besides music so it's nice to do something I'm good at.
BPD,ephx0as,t3_burz98,1559232069.0,"I'm a theatre orchestra musician. Not much to dislike about that. During the day I'm a salesman at a music store which isn't terribly difficult since I know what I'm talking about, and it has the added benefit of being able to purchase reeds at cost and borrow instruments so whenever I need something I don't own like a bass flute or contrabass clarinet I can usually borrow one from the store."

BPD,epbf0p8,t1_epbd5df,1559141672.0,"I'm actually rewatching it now and my perspective is completely different than the first time. I knew nothing about BPD until I heard about it from the show so in the first 2 seasons there was a lot of stuff I related to but it didn't occur to me that those were symptoms of a disorder and that I might have it. Now that I've been diagnosed, watching it again has really helped me identify some of my own problematic patterns of behaviors that I've engaged in. I'm still mostly watching it for the musical numbers, though! I'm a theatre orchestra musician so I just love all the nods to musical theatre."
BPD,ep1w320,t1_ep1vjq6,1558997470.0,"I remember being a younger brother at about his age and feeling very similarly to the way you've described his feelings. Obviously my situation is not the same as yours, but I just want to say that I was actually more upset about the abuse I got from my parents. I might have directed my anger at my older brother and his teasing sometimes, but looking back it came from my parents. So it's entirely possible he's just directing his anger from something else at you. I guess what I'm saying is that the situation is likely more complicated than that. You don't need to punish yourself."

It certainly doesn't make you a bad person. I don't know you but I'll bet you're a good person when it comes down to it. The best thing you can do for your brother is to keep going. You both have clearly been through a lot, and there will be times when you might be upset with each other, but all you can do is just be there and try to be a good influence."

I thought I was good with money and not prone to impulse buying but then I pull this shit. Thankfully I was able to cancel the transaction. I've done this before with other instruments too so now I'm realizing I have a pattern of purchasing new instruments when things go wrong for me, because my job as a musician is the only thing I'm really good at and my only sense of identity is being a musician, so I just put more into that hoping it'll make up for everything I'm missing elsewhere in my life."
