benzodiazepines,fkow4zq,t1_fit84jn,1584396330.0,Just asked my pnp max (atleast NY US) is 8 mg a day legally. Was just perscribed 6.
depression,fj0z20v,t3_farc3n,1582910100.0,I always wish I could just disappear without affecting anyone else's life. Just vanish.
depression,fiudguh,t1_fit99i9,1582739329.0,"Honestly tho, I sit at home doing nothing, thinking this shit couldnt get any fucking worse and some how it does. At this point in close to saying fuck everything let alone some standard. Time to myself makes me go crazy and it doesn't help that my dad doesn't expect shit from. I'm tired of all of this. He threatened to call the cops on me so I said go ahead I don't mind suicide by cops. My life is peachy."

benzodiazepines,fitnna3,t1_fit9hjo,1582725101.0,Sheeesh that must have been one expensive habit! I've only been taking Xanax for the most of 16 months now and don't really ever see myself reaching that level of a tolerance but I don't think I'm going to stop any time soon... Xans are the only thing that helps with my anxiety.
benzodiazepines,fit97ow,t1_fit86kg,1582710387.0,Do u mind me asking how u got to that point? I feel like that's an insane amount and most doctors would think ur just trying to sell them lol
depression,fit933s,t1_fit89d7,1582710213.0,"Tried 5+ therapist non helped I feel like I have finally identified what I would need to work on in it but it would take literally years.

Have a psychiatrist and tried a myriad of drugs and only a few help to an extent. Medication has been the most promising to me but I keep ending up in the same shit situation.

Forgot if I mentioned weed in this but I do smoke often since I am not attending school this semester it's gotten upwards of 3 times a day. Tolerance build up hasn't been too bad but the depression  has been even seeping into the weed high I find myself thinking about and being depressed even while I'm smoking.

To answer your last question, that's mostly want I've been contemplating. Right now even getting out of bed is an effort I cant image doing some of the thing necessary to achieve my dreams anymore. I don't want to take the shortcut... But I'm tired or the suffering.

Part of my problem is def the standards and expectations I have for myself, I wouldn't be me without them, but right now they seem impossible to meet and I feel like a failure."
benzodiazepines,fit3a8f,t1_fiswcgn,1582702630.0,"That's interesting. I can't imagine the circumstances a patentient would have to be in to (legitimately) justify five 2mg a day. 150 bars a month sounds insane.

I have tried Klonopin, but only took around 0.5 mg - 1.5 mg at a time and didn't seem to get nearly as much relief as alprazolam which was dissapointing since I initially liked the feeling more and the longer lasting time of effect was attractive. Along those same lines when I tired Valium I felt very little if anything at all lol. I heard a lot about it before hand, and when I told my dad about how it affected me he was shocked! 

Not sure if it was just the dosages I was of the clonazepam and diazepam that lead to the low levels of effect because I did build up to a moderate dose for both."
