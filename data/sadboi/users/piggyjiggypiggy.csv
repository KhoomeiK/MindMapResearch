There isn't anything wrong with having sex at that age so long as you're given the proper education and resources to do so.

If it's painful to touch I'd consult a vet but otherwise it looks like normal discoloration/tartar. If you have trouble remembering to brush his teeth twice a day, you can wipe his teeth after eating to remove any excess debris with a paper towel or even your finger if he'll let you. Leftover food bits calcify after a few days and cause tartar; when the tartar builds up it's harder to crack off without a dental cleaning. A general rule is if the gums become red/enflamed/painful, they probably need a dental.

TheRightCantMeme,fr1vnro,t1_fr1ugtf,1589826712.0,"https://www.fundyouradoption.org/resources/how-long-does-it-take-to-adopt-a-child/

Have you ever researched how long adoption actually takes? Also a fourteen year old child should not have to be forced to give birth. That could ruin her body and create hormonal imbalances because she isn't even fully grown yet.

If adoption is that easy, why are there so many foster children? It isn't as easy as force person to birth, give baby away, that's it everything is healed!

And I didn't say they shouldn't report. Women should always feel comfortable reporting a rape. The fact is it isn't always safe to, you're not heard, you don't want to live through that trauma time and time again. Have you been raped? Because I've been raped and it isn't as fucking easy as ""oh welp now that that's done with, let me zip up and head down to the police station"". It would be wonderful if we lived in a society where people were actually treated fairly and kindly when they report a rape, but the truth is they're oftentimes met with cold unfeeling people and rape deniers. That's why women don't come forward. It isn't just something that's inopportune in the moment. It's something that they think about FOR YEARS, and over time it only grows worse because the longer you wait the more people will question you.

And the arm argument, really? You're an idiot. My arm is a part of my body, as a living being, and if you cut it off it would be considered maiming and you'd go to prison. But we aren't going to then keep the arm on life support because it is a clump of cells once it's no longer part of my body. My loose arm post-amputation is more of a comparison to the fetal clump of cells I was referring to, but you're clearly too dimwitted to put that much energy into your strawman argument.

TheRightCantMeme,fr1ts4x,t1_fr1s8qb,1589825815.0,"Gee thanks, you sure cleared that up for me. Should I draw a chicken analogy for you? I'm gonna draw a chicken analogy for you! Here goes:

I've owned chickens for years now. Chickens, if you weren't privy to this, lay eggs. Sometimes, the boy chickens (we call them roosters!) mount the girl chickens and give them some of their fun baby-making goo. Each day, the girl chicken lays an egg. Now that there's a male chicken with her, the girl chicken is mounted multiple times daily. This daily egg is now fertile! But it has to be incubated by the mother or an incubator for 21 days, almost like...an external pregnancy! But keep in mind, when that egg first comes out, it's just a mushy little egg in there. Egg whites, yolk, tiny fleck of red where the fetus would develop. This egg would have to go through the full 21 days in order for the chicken inside to be an actual chicken. Otherwise, you crack it open on a pan and it's just a regular fucking egg.

You care more about a dumbass wet egg than the chicken that produced it. The yolk and egg whites of my potential spawn outweigh the value of my own life. A fucking egg. A fucking CLUMP OF CELLS.

Oh wait I FORGOT, silly me since I'm but a woman. I forgot the order of things goes: man, boy, baby, fetus, lowly woman. Oh gosh, it all makes sense now! Why should women be able to have full reign of their bodies when there are men, boys, babies, and clumps of cells out there who could just do it so much better???????!!!!!¬°

TheRightCantMeme,fr1rl9v,t1_fr1odio,1589824750.0,"""There are more families looking for a baby than babies looking for a family""
üòí there are more people looking for a NEWBORN baby, probably white. What about the ~400,000 children currently in foster care in the US? Why the fuck do pro-lifers forget about ACTUAL VIABLE LIVING BREATHING BEINGS once they're born? They don't grow up in loving homes. Children born under circumstances where they won't be kept are not always adopted. That's such disney channel feelgood bullshit.

Also the 14 year old being horny isn't a bad argument. Teenage hormones + lack of sexual education and resources = pregnancy. Not a wild concept.

Maybe it's because of the brain I have, or the fact that I possess a shred of intelligence, who knows -- but forcing people to have children when they aren't equipped to do so is never a good idea, for anyone involved. That's why some people choose to abort when it is, as I must say again because ya'll are incessant about showing off your stupidity, A CLUMP OF CELLS.

Also who is the judge then if abortion is outlawed except for x circumstances, if a girl is raped truly or not? (I typically side with the victim, this is not my own question but one that would probably be posed by some sheisty mfer) We've seen countless times how shitty people are when it comes to handling rapes, so how do you know they won't deny abortion without explicit evidence of said rape?? What if they didn't come forward about the rape initially, find out they're pregnant a few weeks later, and choose to terminate but can't because they never filed a police report? Also you fuckers always forget just how traumatic rape fucking is to begin with. So many women choose to or just physically cannot speak about what happened to them, some of them were even rufied at a bar and can't fucking remember what happened to them. So you want this woman who already went through a traumatic rape to then have to RELIVE that moment every time she tells an officer, every time she tells a nurse, a doctor, everyone else who is now involved in her terminating this clump of cells? It isn't just a quick ""yeah I got raped by this guy, can I abort now?""

It would be endless bullshit, and is just another step pro-BIRTHers (not pro-lifers because that's contradictory, seeing as ya don't care about the life already in front of you, only the clump of cells within said life) are trying to put into place to make abortions harder to get. Abortion shouldn't be such a controversial topic. It should just be fucking allowed. IT IS A CLUMP. OF. CELLS.

Also the president pardons people from their war crimes and has multiplied the amount of civilian deaths by drones in other countries but ya don't care about the actual children being murdered overseas by your own people...but care way too much about clumps of cells being terminated just because ""aw but it has fingernails""?

And yes, it is best that I was sterilized, because I'm not having children. Not because of whatever bullshit morality you think it aligns with. You should also consider sterilization or maybe not having kids, because seeing as you find yourself as a high enough power to force your will over other's autonomy, maybe it isn't best for someone like you to have kids? That's how you become an authoritarian for a parent and no child deserves that.

Also ""the act, for most everyone else, typically results in children""...boy, no.

TikTokCringe,fqo9xu2,t3_gjo2n2,1589510624.0,"she titted onward, breasts held high above all else. titting and titting she went down the trail, bouncing along like a nice pair of knockers. she held her map out as far as she could extend her arms, but could only see so much over her tit mountains. she cried boobily and wiped her tears with the map, if only she had a strong chiseled knight to save her from her own terrible sense of direction"

And it's fine, I'll be over it one day when he eventually dies and blesses this world with his riddance :') I just know how it can look from the outside of the two of them, and she is an adult so many people forget the dynamics between sexual predator and prey and just assume she must be going with it because she likes it"
SweetHomeAlabama,fqo5m8t,t1_fqmim2b,1589508048.0,is this where you smooch and make up?
SweetHomeAlabama,fqo5dmu,t1_fqnnpfp,1589507907.0,"She's probably gone her entire life thinking this is normal, or at least telling herself it is. If nobody else said anything in the moment or ever at all, she could very well feel uncomfortable with what is happening. But since nobody else seems to feel that way AND her grandfather is a huge politician, plus there's a zillion cameras pointing at her and she can't really make a scene in her position as granddaughter to the literal former vice president, she probably thinks it's something she is *supposed* to be ok with.

I completely agree that this is disgusting on his behalf though because he is a vile old perverted pedophile. I just can see things from her side because she's ""legally"" an adult by age but you feel *so* helpless when you're in that kind of position against someone in authority. And he's both an authoritative figure in her family and in the government, so standing up to that probably feels like an astronomical feat.

My ex stepdad started ""grooming"" me probably around 16/17 but it was always such small things he would say to me or in front of me, and this was a man who literally helped raise me. Part of you just doesn't want to believe it's happening because you don't want it to be happening at all. You just kind of go with it because nobody else is doing anything about it and it makes you feel so small and hopeless. And once the asshole normalizes their behavior on their victim, they slowly get worse and worse until it's just blatant fucking sexual assault/harassment/rape and by that point it's too late. Also by that point, everyone starts pointing fingers saying ""why didnt she say anything sooner"" but she probably wanted to and just felt voiceless.

Anyhoo im sorry about the block of text lol i just don't feel that blame should be shifted onto her because he's the disgusting one here"
