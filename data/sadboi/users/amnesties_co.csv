menwritingwomen,fq8jdkp,t1_fq7lte8,1589167560.0,"I can see why this was a popular thought but working with kids, you can see that this scene was not for the adults watching. That scene reeeaally affected how the students I work with saw female superheroes. Like bonkers levels of influence on first graders. Marvel does not handle female characters well, or even close a lot of the time, but this scene shouldn‚Äôt be belittled to ‚Äúlook it‚Äôs women‚Äù because imo, it amplified the importance of females on the team. It also was very strategic that they all came to save Spidey! Who is very clearly the favourite of all my boys."
taiwan,fpqai72,t1_fpq2fhp,1588818521.0,"I‚Äôve been to Taiwan many times and Korea only once for two weeks. I‚Äôll compare Taipei and Seoul for brevity, but if you want me to compare smaller cities let me know! 

Seoul is more populated but I think Taipei is more dense with narrower streets and smaller neighbourhood/boroughs. I‚Äôd say the public transit is very comparable in terms of cost and ease of navigation, but Seoul is more... aggressive haha. If you‚Äôre worried about language skills, then I‚Äôd say there are pretty equal amounts of use of English and accessibility like street signs or asking for help. I would say as a foreigner it‚Äôs quite easy to approach citizens or ordering food. Depending on your appearance/ethnicity, I can see why it might be harder for certain people in Korea and that sentiment might not be as prevalent in Taipei. 

Food wise, I think Taiwan is cheaper and there are much more vegetarian options, but overall milder in taste. Seoul is also much more populated (3x Taipei) so you will always be able to find a good option. 

Leaving Taipei, you don‚Äôt need to go far to see some natural attractions, whereas it‚Äôs a bit further away to see this in Seoul due to size and industrialization. Taiwan spends a lot of money for natural site maintenance and nature-focused tourism. 

For night life, Seoul is more of a 24/7 system for drinking. Taipei on the other hand has specific nights of the week that people tend to go out on."

At most, people would eat venison and would try to avoid meats from animals that could be used for other purposes, like prowling. If I remember correctly, there was actually a centuries-long ban on eating red meats too."

It also includes voice recordings of the dialogue and vocab if I‚Äôm remembering correctly. The workbook is up to you, but if you don‚Äôt have access to someone who could correct or check over your work it might be tough. The workbook includes problems like multiple choice, fill in the blank, translations, short answer, dialogue completion etc. I believe they also have a book for writing the characters, but you can always just do so on any regular notebook."

CrewsCrew,fcjthm0,t1_fcjsfpx,1577703902.0,"For your first point, yes, sure, but nearly all countries were poor between the 30s-50s from depression and then oncoming wars aside from the US (to a degree), but I‚Äôd argue that China had the worst economic recovery that was offset until the early 90s. That‚Äôs 45 years of poverty. That doesn‚Äôt just happen as a result of being ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. 

Again, I‚Äôm not blaming anyone for their initial position, but there was indescribable amounts of... let‚Äôs say mismanagement... that lead to extreme poverty of almost 90% of the population. From what I know, no other country participating in WWII or the Sino-Japanese war that preceded it suffered to such an extent. 

The introduction of Maoism and extreme communism was what shifted millions of people suffering into almost EVERYONE suffering. I am not against communism, but we shouldn‚Äôt paint chinese economic history into being an act of saviorism. A forced agrarian society built on bloodshed, land stealing and coattail riding that lead to half a century of poverty shouldn‚Äôt be considered ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù. I‚Äôd go so far as to say the regime actually cornered the country into its most violent and turbulent period of modern history. The economic reform that took the millions and millions that you are referring to was actually due to a coerced open market to japan and the western world. It was the PRCs last resort."
