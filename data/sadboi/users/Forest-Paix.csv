WeightLossAdvice,fq98nz2,t3_ghe9gc,1589189602.0,"Its a stressful time around the world and it is natural to turn to something comforting. I think you should allow yourself some gentleness regarding your eating. Allow yourself some snacks and unhealthy food but only after a cup of herbal tea. A hot cup of herbal tea will take the edge off unless you are truly hungry. Other than that, pampering yourself could be an alternative form of comforting. Final thought, I find that sometimes the more I stress about what I have eaten the more my eating becomes bad. Going for walks to spot birds and ticking off tasks on my list help me keep occupied. :)"

muacirclejerk,er64xja,t3_c06xpu,1560540029.0,Tbh i thought he had genuinely changed but didnt follow him closely. However I lost all interest in him after the whole thing with James Charles. I have never been a James Charles fan but I thought the way people behaved was shocked and Jeffree just fueled it.  Also not to mention h3h3 pointing out things like Jeffreeâ€™s behaviour in the past such as tweeting at Justin Bieber wondering how big his dick is. Two faced hypocrite.
