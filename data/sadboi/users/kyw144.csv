Timer stops when there`s an item in your chest. 

Timer starts ticking from 0 when you pick up the reward. 

If you will do this more often, then smaller timers will be refreshed and this is good for you, because you will get smaller rewards more often. 

Its not like M gear can somehow be downgraded to L when you beat the stage in a wrong time. 
Its all separete tickin things for every type of reward."
afkarena,fr2ulrh,t1_fr2q2ir,1589844197.0,"Sup. As I\`m not the guy with parsed code in my pocket, I will just assume what\`s most expected scenario based on the ton of guides and 1y of play.   


I assume that the pity-timer starts when you lose the stage 

I assume that item-timer ticks as we live and refreshes when you get the item (without randomized additions)  


I also assume that it refreshes when you get the reward.   


So the logic behind this looks like this:   


You have two timers there. itemTimer -- reward receiving timer.  pityTimer -- pity timer for failed stages.   
The first one is ticking non-stop. The second one starts when you lose the stage.   


&#x200B;

And the possible scenarios are:   


1. You fail the stage, you win it AFTER passing X time, but BEFORE 2x    
 Outcomes:   
a. **itemTimer** will be reset to 0s  
b. **pityTimer** will be removed for that exact reward.  
c. you will get the item
2.  You fail the stage, you win it BEFORE passing X time.    
 Outcomes:   
a. **itemTimer** is still counting up to 2X time  
b. **pityTimer** is removed (because you won)  
c.  you don't get the item 
3. You fail the stage, you win AFTER 2X time.   
a. itemTimer will be reset at 2X. It will start counting again from that point.   
b. **? Is it still ticking? Do we get a second stone after 8d 12h? I can\`t remember.**  
c. you will get the item. 

&#x200B;

And the TRICK will be the (a) scenario. All it gives you is reduction of the required time by half. From 8 days to 4 days as max.

OP posted an app to actually track most of the things like tree calculation, hero stats (derailed crit, dodge, etc) and it is 100% matching with game stats  which anybody can check if they will put their heroes into it.

4. Testing data attributes (kekw): 选择礼包测试1(不用翻译)   --- Select gift pack test 1 (no translation required)
5. T4 gear diamond value is 32k. Also, there are other gear values, I guess that's for limited deals
6. T3-4 gear has pretty random stats. For example, Mage Weapon on T2 gives 90 dodge and on T3 only 70 dodge. It's in progress probably.
7. T3 gear starts from 29-1
8. T4 gear starts from 31-1
9. Haste and MSPD are different stats !!!! What.
10. Minimum power requirement for 34-60 is  97,410 milions. Seems pretty far away.
11. Minimum power requirement for 35-1 is 999 millions. Funny.
