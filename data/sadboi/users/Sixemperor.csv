Transformemes,fr335hj,t1_fr32uov,1589848996.0,"Maybe. I know he’s from one of the Anime transformers cartoons. My point still stands though that it doesn’t really matter if the character originated from an anime and if people won’t recognize it. Tbh, I don’t even know half the characters they released because I was born in 99, so I never had the opportunity to watch the original cartoon or anything. So, they definitely can and should make Star Saber because the big transformers fans will love and appreciate it, and newer fans can be introduced to a great character. They could definitely work Star Saber into the new cartoon series on Netflix too like they did with overlord with titans return."

Fathers in Japan rarely see their children because they’re expected to work all the time almost nonstop. On Father’s Day in Animal crossing, the father sends a letter with a red carnation which is meant to symbolize that he’s still alive.
