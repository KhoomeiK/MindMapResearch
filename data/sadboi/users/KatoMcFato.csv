For me I like variety so prefer shorter series feels more refreshing, plus my family don’t like me spending ages in my room so it’s usually at night I’m watching. 

I’ll bare it in mind though thanks, could always watch some then come back every so often"

anime,fpg2teg,t1_fpg2sp3,1588592505.0,Thanks
Animesuggest,fpakbgi,t3_gcc6nj,1588449936.0,"One that’s like what your saying is {Re:Zero} it’s a psychological anime about a guy who’s isakeid, put into another world, and when he died returns to another point where people forgot everything that happened after that point. It’s a great storyline too and **small spoiler** later someone is forgotten."
Animesuggest,fp2x4vj,t1_fp2worl,1588269356.0,Forgot to mention all these should be on Crunchyroll I suggest using that for most anime’s since Netflix here doesn’t have much. Download an addblocker also if you use a computer to watch it
Animesuggest,fp2w8oz,t3_gaz3e4,1588268931.0,"Also in uk and have same sort of goal as you but less watch everything just what’s good but here’s what I’ve watched and plan to watch which ones I have watch I recommend:

{Re:Zero} best going in blind, has darker theme, watch the directors cut version on Crunchyroll not the individual seasons 

{Kaguya sama: love is War} season 2 airing weekly, very good light hearted and make you smile

{no game no life} another very good one about a world where you play games to make decisions so if your into video games be sure to watch it

(These I have not watched but told they’re good)

{Steins:Gate} recently started psychological anime more serious and dark but worth the watch 

{Konosuba} not watched, more light hearted with good storyline 

{made in Abyss} seems like a good little dark anime about people going into the abyss, a chasm, to find relics etc 

{is the order a rabbit} a more go happy cutesy anime, nice to contract what you watch 

{angel beats} from what I’ve heard it’s good I think a little sad but good mix of little dark little happy mood

This isn’t a great list and if others see this correct me on any titles I haven’t watched and their themes if I have them wrong. If you want to find new anime I recommend browsing r/animemes and commenting for the sauces under any anime you think looks good or that people seem to know. 

Also go on [this link for most popular anime currently ](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?type=bypopularity) and make an account on my anime list to record any anime you have watched and going to watch as I found out about it yesterday and it’s very useful to track everything (also says how many hours you will have spent watching anime which I’m guessing if you want to binge a lot you might wanna see as be proud of it like me) 

Also quickly adding these are less well known/talked about to the typical ones the media covers so check out the most popular in the link for any of those someone else I just saw said most of them above. 

Hope this helps and sorry this is long or poorly worded/formatted and have fun watching anime!"

TeenageSuicideWatch,fmm0syj,t3_fvtl13,1586196680.0,"Hey I get how you feel and where your coming from and it’s okay to feel this way especially having to be cooped up in isolation. The best way to cope I find is set yourself a task, long or short but preferably longer the better. Then set to achieve that goal. For example gardening, you could set a task of making a section of your garden nice by cleaning it up cutting bushes plant some things etc. Whether the tasks take a day or a week to do it occupies you and you feel good doing it especially when finished as you know and can see the finished product. Take a break a bit knowing you earned it then when you want set another task. 

Another option is take up a new hobby and learn and master it. This you can do at your own pace and means you can do it whenever you want less of a commitment like the task idea. Good luck hope this helps and if you have any other questions ask away!"

HollowKnight,flxtghv,t3_fruyeo,1585589505.0,"Oh I remember that little shit as if it was yesterday. It took ages but some advice:

When it comes up, dream nail it for soul. You have to jump up two platforms to get level when it pops out then you should get two dream nail hits. Keep returning to dream nailing so you have soul for the next tip 

Use a sideways blast (I’m bad with names) when there’s an opportunity to hit a smaller one so it collides.

Focus on dodging, especially when close. It’s annoying but you’ll get it soon enough. Nobody talks about how hard this little fucker is on radiant but it takes a while so stick around

Charm recommendations:
- dream nail one (again bad with names) 1 notch
- shamen stone 3 notches 
- mark of pride 3 notches 
- soul eater 4 notches 

That’s a basic guide but overcharm for it when on radiant if you don’t already. Good luck, I pity how much longer you have to do it"

With 7 notches and 6 masks it can be hard I’d recommend getting more masks in the future but for your charms so you have shamen stone? It’ll make your spells much stronger so use that instead of quick heal you mentioned but if you prefer to keep it, use shamen stone, quick heal and grubsong for soul it gives you soul whenever you take damage

HollowKnight,fkl5ljk,t3_fj68zw,1584298973.0,"I literally just finished it a few hours ago and yeah it’s annoying knowing I nearly beat it first few goes without GPZ and was annoying when I did unlock him, it felt soo much more rewarding. Compared to the fourth one (up until the final boss) it’s way harder. 

Tips for GPZ: keep defeating him in hall of gods and when you have on attuned try on ascended. You have to just give him space and hit when you can, kill the little zote bitch boys straight away and when he spawns the exploding ones you can hit him a lot while he screams before finding a safe spot. 

Tips for after GPZ: your gonna be a little low on health after unless you practice enough but luckily after is uumuu which can be annoying. Play it safe and you’ll have time to heal or learn how to defeat it quickly in HoG (ill say my method if you want it) then hornet have a half where the thorns you clear off and just watch her, usually a small jump in one direction does the trick. 

Tips for sly: same for GPZ, keep your distance and find the spots he’s actually pretty easy especially compared to the ones leading up to him. Hard to explain but hit him, wait for him to strike strike and spin upwards then when he lands hit again. Repeat and dodge the other various attacks then the final stage just focus on dodging then when he stops spinning hit quickly then get ready to repeat. Stay away from the edges for him otherwise you’ll get trapped. 

Hope this helps don’t put the game down it’ll be a mistake if it gets hard just practise the bosses and other bosses in HoG like it got hard for me so I started getting radiant on other bosses which helps for the fourth pantheon anyway. Good luck it’s amazing when you complete it."
HollowKnight,fki5r5p,t3_fim09z,1584212459.0,"A good one to use is mark of pride, quick slash and unbreakable strength then there’s 2 spare notches which you can have unbreakable heart, longnail etc but the first three work really well"

HollowKnight,fk1csmg,t1_fk1bcxz,1583777042.0,"There’s no requirement but depends on where your up to i assumed your quite late game if your at kingdoms edge but at some point I’d suggest getting more masks, it’s worth it. 

For charms though I’d say depends on if you prefer spell builds like the one you’ve done or nail builds (what I go for). Best spell build I’d say for hornet is shamen stone, soul catcher, then if you like steady body that and grubsong but if not I’d say long nail so you have better range. Nail build I’d go for mark of pride, quickslash (or unbreakable strength if you have it)  and steady body if you like it or grubsong. 

nail build might not work as well earlier game with less notches but in the future when you have max my normal set up is mark of pride, quick slash, unbreakable strength and depends on boss for final 2 notches (11 notches is the max). Then spell build with max notches go for shamen stone, soul eater, spell twister and your choice final 2 notches (longnail I usually go for) 

Sorry this got long but they’re the main good charm builds for other bosses hope this helped"

HollowKnight,fjthyd0,t1_fjthbcy,1583607952.0,"Wait do you mean Godhome? To get to that area you have to beat The Hollow Knight (assuming you know who it is as you know what the Radiance is) then you must follow steps to get there, look it up to see."
HollowKnight,fjth6gr,t1_fjtgsrh,1583607785.0,Ooh good build gotta love an auto damage deck. There’s a charm later that I’d like glowing womb you’ll find so you can have even more babies!
HollowKnight,fjtgvak,t1_fjt1lew,1583607685.0,Beat a boss on ascended difficultly and it unlocks
HollowKnight,fjtfzvq,t1_fjtfjuo,1583607483.0,"Ah apologies your able to upgrade them later in the game, wait you said you had the grimmchild right? So go to divine in the next door tent and give her one of the charms but fixed. Speak to her a couple more times and give her 14000 geo, she’ll give it back so it’s unbreakable. I’d recommend it for future battles same for heart, whichever you want first is your choice just not greed it’s a waste."
HollowKnight,fjtf83j,t3_feyv41,1583607216.0,Personally I’d go for a nail build using quickslash unbreakable strength and longnail with shamen stone. This is what I usually do for many bosses since quickslash gets soul whilst with unbreakable strength deals lots of damage then shamen stone makes the spells stronger. However haven’t battled her early game for a while so not sure how I’d change it
HollowKnight,fjkz0za,t3_fdsds5,1583436711.0,"The two crystal guardians are pretty easy, use the loadout you mentioned of mark of pride, quick slash and unbreakable strength and then sharp shadow to just dash through him each time they shoot the laser at you. Second one is a little harder but another easy one is hornet protector. Just practice radiant is pretty hard for many of them though."
HollowKnight,fjhcrha,t3_fdgd2i,1583345618.0,"Hey congrats and good charm build for it never would’ve thought of dashmaster but it’s a great idea and works well. Little advice didn’t know if you knew or not but for doing radiant battles, use overcharming. Look it up if you don’t know what it is but I’d recommend it makes radiant battles somewhat easier"
