AmItheAsshole,fm81uvs,t3_ftd115,1585841207.0,"Nta, thats nice of you to even offer to pay their first payment of rent. You can only help so much till it runs you to the ground though. They gotta remember they‚Äôre adults and the moment responsibility came up is why that reality check to them hit kinda hard. You have your own responsibilities and so do they."

visualnovels,f6gr3a4,t3_dqzuzu,1572829383.0,"Im excited. When I first started playing visual novels there wasn‚Äôt much for me to choose from. However I feel that translations have come a long way. The business is still a difficult market for translators and company devs. But overall I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôll be able to enjoy some great games I couldn‚Äôt play because of my lack speak/reading japanese.

Thanks for the updates!"
AskReddit,f4v9i7i,t3_dlrz06,1571838851.0,Back then cars/trucks did not have a door sensor to indicate it wasn‚Äôt closed. As my Dad drives I fall out of the truck because I did not close the door tight enough and was swinging on the seatbelt from my stomach. My knuckles and fingers were scraping against the road until the truck stopped.

Thank you for the suggestion though! If you have any other suggestions I would be more than willing to listen to them!"
AskReddit,ey5bndi,t3_cvgdlt,1566827518.0,"My mom made beef stew for the first time, it was like pig slop. A lot of the veggies were pretty random and the consistency was very thick ( a little less than pudding). It was also overcooked so it had a burnt after taste.

I think though from a lot of stories of cooks in here, if the cooks just taste their own food before serving I think that might help lol."
BikiniBottomTwitter,exdvkcn,t3_cs9e3m,1566188107.0,"I remember there was a running test and to help the unfit she ran the mile test too and stayed at a controlled pace, the limit was to run a mile under 7 minutes.

Everyone who ran at her pace failed because the pace she set was too slow which ended her run around 9 minutes. It just sucks for whoever believed in her because what a fuckin scam lol.  I passed because I was going around the speed the physically fit kids were going and glad I didn‚Äôt follow that teacher."

depression,es46vbi,t3_c5j15l,1561578355.0,"Yeah I come across that feeling from time to time, but I‚Äôve come to realize the mindset of that is who they are what they‚Äôve done but it‚Äôs not me. I try to focus on who I am and where I‚Äôm at and grow from there. A bit of weight is lifted off me when I don‚Äôt think how much more people are better than me but my desire to improve, even if it‚Äôs only a little at a time.

So yeah in short it‚Äôs okay to be impressed but try and focus on yourself is what i‚Äôm trying to say?"
