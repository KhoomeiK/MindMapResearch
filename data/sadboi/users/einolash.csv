Ride through the first months, and you‚Äôll soon find pockets of time that feel like such a blessing. Try find the small moments in work that make it more enjoyable, and something to look forward to (however small). 
And know that you are not alone. Most of the world is slaving away to this horrible system, and what you see on social media (the billionaires you talk about) for example is just the few blessed.

Fitness,etr6o4x,t3_cczxa2,1563113726.0,"Hello hello! Firstly - well done for making a change! Like others have said - walking into the gym and actually going is the most difficult part. 
Most others are saying ask a trainer - but I know some gyms that don‚Äôt have trainers, and sometimes some people are too intimidated to even ask. So here‚Äôs the really fail proof option; 
- bring the essentials. Water bottle and towel. A good enough start. 
- wear something that makes you feel good and gives you confidence. This can even be your most flattering t-shirt that‚Äôs workout appropriate- just something that motivates you. 
- do the most basic... start of with stretching. Just go in and spend a good couple of mins stretching. Maybe even google a few stretches beforehand and keep them ready on your phone so you can start off with that (or write them down) 
- you could theoretically just stretch as the extent of your workout  - sometimes that counts enough as a workout (guess what yoga is) 
- but if that‚Äôs boring, you can then move to the failsafe workouts: the treadmill, elliptical, sit-ups, bicep curls etc. 
- I would recommend the treadmill - and just walk and watch people. That‚Äôs how I learnt in the gym. See what exercises people are doing and with what equipment. Later on you can try emulate it and repeat. 
- most exercise machines also have visual instructions and tells you what machine targets what muscles. With each gym, the equipment is always different, so it‚Äôs not uncommon even for experienced gym goers to need to walk around and take note. Don‚Äôt feel intimidated by this. 
- and ask people! I always ask people (who seems friendly) who are doing workouts if I can join them, or if they can show me what exercise they are doing etc. Just a fun way to learn more and maybe make a friend. 
- like I said before - just go and watch. Or even watch YouTube videos. Or google online. There‚Äôs a wealth of experience so slowly start exposing yourself to it and you‚Äôll be good! 
All the best! Please do update me how it goes!"
