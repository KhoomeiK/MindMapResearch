Maybe you think my hat (for example) is ugly and maybe most people think it’s ugly but if I think it’s nice I shouldn’t have to agree just so I don’t seem too sensitive.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

Edit: grammar."

Sagittarians,fi7jv2y,t3_f353cl,1582222762.0,"OMG this is so accurate and whilst I know that being this way can be hurtful to others most of the time that’s not the intention or reason behind it. I also think that although Sagittarians are free spirited and blunt, we are able to see when we’ve done something wrong and maybe even apologize for hurting someone’s feelings because of our decisions which is more than I can say for some signs like Gemini’s lol (that doesn’t mean we’ll regret our decisions just because they hurt someone)... but the fact that you can acknowledge that you’ve hurt people through doing what’s best for you is still a BIG DEAL because a lot of signs hurt people and see nothing wrong with it... I’m rambling, point is I don’t think you’re malicious - because your intention is to be true to yourself, maybe you’re selfish but the older I get I think most people are selfish so yea..."

sugarlifestyleforum,fdeh0ms,t3_ekwqh3,1578338837.0,"I think a trial idea might be a good way to go. Tell her she can move in for 2 weeks or a month or something because the thing is it may seem like it’s going great with both of them but your SB’s friend is probably always on her best behavior because she wants you to take her as an SB (well she probably wants you to). So she might not be being authentic, I also echo the sentiments of everyone else about the jealousy thing. Sometimes us females can go from besties one moment to jealous and catty."
quotes,fddrqtc,t1_fdaxrnn,1578322261.0,"I understand that and I’m not trying to disregard your experience and opinions. I too have been through a great deal of trauma and I decided to pick myself up. 
So I understand where you are coming from. And you are right that our healing has to be our choice. 

However I have noticed that people that have been through a lot and have picked themselves up and moved forward do tend to be more harsh at times when advising people who are in the same spot they were in. I think that when you pick yourself up and move on from something that almost broke you or that did break you, and you put the pieces back together it makes you so so much stronger and it can feel unbelievably empowering to know that “I went through that trauma but I made it out” and it’s definitely something to be proud of, however often times that can make people a bit big headed and unfeeling. I don’t know if I’m explaining this sufficiently but I’m saying that I can tell you’ve been through a lot and dealt with it and moved forward, I can tell because at first your advice seemed incredibly unfeeling (and I also used to give advice this way).

Just remember how hurt and broken you were during your trauma and in future try to be more compassionate in the way you advise people because now I can tell you meant well but your delivery was off. 

Sorry for the long explanation, I hope I got my point across. Feel free to pm me if you need to.  Thanks for clarifying about the forgiveness thing."
Humanoidencounters,fd8vod0,t1_fd6iyv5,1578224083.0,"Check out the Bedtime Stories channel on YouTube, they do really awesome narratives and illustrations of paranormal encounters from humanoids to aliens and glitches in the matrix. Here’s a video they did about “Skinwalker Ranch”

quotes,fd61ms9,t1_fd5glq9,1578184284.0,"Lol what are you forgiving this person for ?? I understand what you are both saying but I do feel that your advice is incredibly insensitive because clearly this analogy in the quote is referring to more than just physical representations of how someone can “let negativity in”. That said,  when you experience something you can’t just get rid of the negativity by flipping a switch, it’s a process. 

And yes, as you said it’s our job to not continually “let the negativity in” but if someone doesn’t choose to actively stop that negativity from getting in of course we can say they ought to be proactive in their own healing but it does not mean it is their fault if they do not heal. Shit happens and if people could choose to not have negativity in their life in the first place they probably would so that they don’t have to “stop it from getting in” in the future. I hope this makes sense.

You can be “woke” and compassionate at the same time. 
P.S I hate the word woke but I feel that last sentence had to be said."
quotes,fd5wtom,t1_fd3hxka,1578182494.0,"Exactly, I was thinking the same thing. I understand the analogy, however if there is a hole in a ship but the ship is like “nope I’m not allowing you in” lol that water will get in regardless. It’s the same with people if something has hurt someone in a certain way in a specific area of their life, for a while they will be weak in that spot and vulnerable to certain elements getting in/taking over."

Sagittarians,fca6n17,t1_fc90jlg,1577563834.0,"Yea exactly I’ve experienced the same thing and it’s weird because I feel like all the Gemini’s I’ve met have always acted like loyalty and being trustworthy is really important to them so it makes you believe that they are loyal and trustworthy but in the end, in my experience they prove to be the opposite and are usually very unapologetic..,"

heartbreak,fa9ij4o,t1_fa96k82,1575875087.0,"Hey, thank you for your comment. Funny thing is I’ve never thought of myself as a codependent person. I think I’ve always kinda known that I am but I’m also a really independent person and everyone around me always emphasizes how “independent and strong” I am when thy talk about my character. Which is great but in some ways it kinda made me feel like “oh well, it doesn’t matter who I date I’m still really independent”. So I didn’t realize how codependent I am. Until now, so thank you for that. I’ll check out that book.

And on the counselor thing... I have been to a counselor here and there in the past but the free counselor’s at my university aren’t that good. When I had a second session with one of the counselors he mixed up what I had previously told him with what another client had said so I didn’t go back."
