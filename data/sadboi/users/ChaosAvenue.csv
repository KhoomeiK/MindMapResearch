Anxiety,fmph98k,t3_fwm9rl,1586280802.0,I wonder if it has anything to do with memory? I have an extremely good memory and can replay a lot of past events like I experienced it yesterday but then because negative events are connected to stronger emotions my mind tends to recall them so much easier than positive ones. I’ll be calmly watching TV then a word or sound or whatever will trigger a negative memory and I have to physically stop myself from getting annoyed about it! My friend on the other hand has an extremely poor memory and is never bothered by things in the past because he simply doesn’t remember them.

birding,fmb81fb,t1_fmb2vbt,1585920701.0,Good point! I was referring to a balmy summer week spent at a lake cabin hearing the loons call softly as the sun set. I think the novelty would wear off pretty quick if it was a permanent feature!

nancydrew,fm5ulqk,t3_ft8hmm,1585780273.0,Coming across classic ND in-jokes or references to games and characters within other games. Really ties the games together and makes the series feel that little bit more special

nancydrew,fdse0fa,t3_emz8dr,1578700516.0,Yes. I bought a postcard in Prague because I really connected to the picture on it for some reason. Turns out the same image by artist Alphonse Mucha is used in a Nancy Drew game and I only realised much later. Nancy Drew infiltrates my life without me even knowing

socialanxiety,fbz8fkr,t1_fbz7n0r,1577238338.0,I’m the same. For me it’s because I’ve decided that other people’s feedback means nothing unless I believe it myself. I adopted this mentality to stop myself from believing mean things that were said about me that weren’t true. Same goes for compliments. Someone can tell me I look nice or performed well but I don’t care what other people think.

nancydrew,f9rpq74,t3_e6ks6j,1575579579.0,The relationship drama is dumb and juvenile and doesn’t belong in a game that used be intellectual and sophisticated. I agree there is no need to write this in the script. It proves these people don’t have a grasp on the essence of Nancy Drew. I’m sorry the upset this has caused you.

nancydrew,f9hqkfx,t3_e4yxwl,1575319790.0,Oh gosh this is so funny I can’t stop laughing. Part of the reason the point and click games were successful was because of the immersive graphics I think? I can’t even take this seriously
socialanxiety,f8eb56h,t3_e09ajq,1574523853.0,I always text too fast and hit send then regret every grammatical/spelling error I made and get paranoid about why they’re not texting me back right away and then finally I wish I was dead

socialanxiety,f78g1as,t3_duqp9m,1573492525.0,"When I was sixteen at a sports camp in France we had to pick an afternoon activity and so I picked dance but when I turned up they said we were going to learn a “sexy chair dance” and perform it to the entire group at the camp. Me and some other girls didn’t want to do it and when they turned to leave the dance teacher started yelling at them in French about messing up the sports rota. I just panicked, jumped out the nearest window and legged it."
