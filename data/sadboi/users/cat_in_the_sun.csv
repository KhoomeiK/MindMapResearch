In porn, you never get rejected. 
In porn, you don‚Äôt have to ask yourself if you‚Äôre being competent or adequate enough. You don‚Äôt have to measure yourself up.
In porn, you don‚Äôt have to wonder if she‚Äôs enjoying or not cause she‚Äôll pretend she‚Äôs having the best time.
Basically, porn takes care of three very important male vulnerabilities. 
Eventually porn becomes the go to for a lot of things instead of its own ‚Äúbecause I enjoy it on occasion.‚Äù

Onlyfans is like porn on steroids.

This is what it took to fill me with anger back in those days. I ranted to my mother for 10 min (exaggerated for effect) explaining my anger. How childish this is. How if I were to do this, I‚Äôd get jail time.
