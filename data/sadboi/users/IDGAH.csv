evolution,f8o6roz,t1_f8juogu,1574665216.0,I never suggested anything about domestication; i was just asking why we feel absolutely no sense of kinship to the most genetically similar living species to us when a massive percentage of humans very frequently think of animals that are vastly different from us (most commonly cats and dogs but there are some outliers too) as an actual member of their family lol.

You cant really know for sure until you know and i mean sure you have the right to react however you feel but im just saying, even if it might seem like the most likely situation, if you can help it try not to assume the worst bc its not good for your self esteem at all you know and it could potentially make him feel like shit the same way it does to you. If he does just have a vendetta specifically against you though then im sorry and just try not to let it get to you you know like thats the thing about people is they have opinions so anything that anyone likes about you, someone else is gonna view it as a thing to dislike about you and visa-versa lmao all it means when someone dislikes you is that there are actually parts about you that distinguish you from the rest of the crowd and thats an awesome thing.

Forcing yourself on someone who is too utterly terrified or cant even find the motivation to say a word to you is not healthy for them even if it is a mandatory assignment. I can assure you that whatever he has going on in his mind is worse than not being able to get your assignment done.

And another thought thats always helped me immensely and i hope will do the same for you is that i know the incredible extent to which the human body can experience pain and seething rage and overwhelming sorrow, and that only fills me with endless hope bc i can only assume that we have the same capacity to feel love and happiness and i believe that we will know that feeling one day and that all of this shit will have been worth it for both of our sakes and theres not a drop of blood in me that is even remotely doubtful of that being our fate. Overall just know that i believe in you and that you are loved even if its by people you havent even met yet but if you can muster the courage to forge on to the day where you finally meet them then you will finally feel that love and youll also be able to share with them the love that you have been devoid of people to give it to and that is beautiful and i just can not express how much i believe in you to accomplish all of those things."
depression,f3ghtfn,t3_dgvftl,1570911455.0,"Jesus man your situation is probably far worse than mine and im so sorry that youve been forced to deal with that but believe me man, i might not have it as bad as you but i know complete social isolation all too well and while it might be nice for me to be fucked up mostly on the inside, so that people cant tell immediately and they might actually give me a chance bc of it, i also wouldnt ever wanna be friends with anyone who would make fun of someone like you, and not to pull the cliche look at the brightside bs, but seriously if there were any brightside to this its that in a lot of cases you probably dont have to wonder if someone is a piece of shit or not and then put your faith in them only to find out later that they actually are a piece of shit and have your faith in them ripped from you. idk if that makes you feel any better or not but i just wanted to point it out in case it would and you hadnt considered it yet. But basically man, first of all fuck your dad and sister they have no right to say that shit to you or make you do those horrible things and saying that your motivation is admirable would be a massive understatement and honestly man, if you can get a job anywhere, idk where you live or what kind of gyms there are for you to go to but for me, i go to planet fitness and it literally costs $10 a month if you can find a way to cover that cost then you can fucking tear that shit up man i seriously believe in you so much you know like get fucking ripped man take pride in your body reclaim it as your own i think that would make you feel a lot stronger physically and mentally in a ton of ways and then at that point i think youll be a lot more motivated than you already are in life which already seems like more than enough and at that point if you can find any job in the whole world that has a decent wage and health insurance that you think you might enjoy, and if you can find a way to work towards getting that job, youll be fucking set man and you can get that surgery yourself and there is not one cell in my body that does not believe in you with everything i fucking have to pull that shit off. Btw idk if this helps man but the way ive always looked at it that made me feel better was it always seemed to me that pretty much every single other person i ever knew as a kid/ very young adulthood was happy but something else i noticed, is while seemingly all of them were happy in their childhoods, a fuck ton of them end up hating their adulthoods/ barely being content with them, and honestly whenever i think about that that always makes me feel like IM the LUCKY one which is insane lmfao but seriously you know its a trade off everyone else might have gotten to have their childhoods but i get my adulthood man and im 20 rn and i still have some shit im trying to sort out but honestly once i get all my shit figured out i have the entire rest of my adulthood to be happy as fuck man like honestly its fairly common for people to live to be 100 rn imagine what itll be when we're that old that means i have like a minimum of 80 fucking years to finally, truly be alive and make my life my own and finally reclaim that shit once and for all and im so excited to do that and i hope that you are too and honestly no matter what happens id rather be me any day than one of those fucks who made your life hell you know and idk if anything i said was able to help you at all but i really hope that it was and if not then just know that i believe in you man you fucking got this shit and i hope that things get better for you real fucking quick bc you deserve to know happiness man, you do. and if you ever feel that theres no one else you can talk to again man ill be here for you 1-815-953-5285 hmu any time any day whenever you want about anything you want man dont hesitate id love someone to talk to anyways haha.

depression,f384m3o,t1_f37mjb2,1570733380.0,"Btw correct me if im wrong but im assuming you are in high school and believe me i know exactly how you feel my entire life everyones just gone out of their way to treat me as trash and my parents were the worst out of everyone they were constantly abusive whenever we saw each other usually verbally / emotionally but sometimes physically too and i had a few people id hang out with sometimes over the years but sooner or later theyd all ditch me i never had any real friends and fucking forget about relationships lmfao and as long as i could remember i just wished that the world would just fucking suck me up and kill me already you know? But for me right now im 20 and im still working on getting out of my hometown but im so close and ill finally be leaving by the end of this year and ill finally be able to fucking be alive for the first time in my life. Its like, obviously i dont know you or your goals / intrests / plans / particular situation, but if you literally just find one type of job that you think you could be happy doing, just one job out of all of them in the whole world, which you should absolutely look into btw if you havent bc highschool doesnt give you jack shit for job options all they care about is college and if not that theyre like: ""uhhhh theres like welders ig"" lmfao but obviously theres like an infinite amount of stuff you could do and i wish i tried to come up with a more solid plan when i was still in high school bc ive spent most of my time since high school figuring out that plan, but the point is, you just need to come up with one job that you could be content with, one place in the whole world you could be content living, one person in the whole world you could be friends with, and eventually one person in the whole world who you could be in a relationship with. And idk about you but thats all i need to be fucking amazing and if you think about it theres absolutely no way that you cant find one of each of those things especially bc up until now youve been limited to the random fucks at your school and maybe a couple others but pretty soon not only will the variety of people youll be able to meet multiply like to no fucking end, but also wherever you end up going and whatever you end up doing while youre there, you went there and did that bc you wanted to specifically go there and do that and so did a ton of the other people there so its so much more likely that youll be able to relate to them more than when youre just in your town going to your towns school bc you have to and so does everyone else, and literally once you have one of those things finding a fuck ton more opportunities / people becomes way easier, and basically like the way ive always looked at it is, its not uncommon for people to live to 100 right now, imagine what that will be like when we're 100, so when i was in high school, all i thought about was, if i just go through a few more years of total fucking bullshit, i have at least the next 80 years to be happy as fuck and build a real life, and thats exactly what im about to start doing and its going to be so worth it and i really hope that you can do the same.

Btw i just wanted to add in case you feel the same way that i did that my plan in particular involves joining the military and in high school i never even considered for a second that the military might be an option for me but it actually has an unbelievable variety of things you can do and i would say it literally has something for literally everyone and you should definitely look into it at least a little bit bc if you cant come up with anything else its really not so bad at all it only takes 4 years minimun for most contracts unless you wanna do longer and even still for me when i think about 4 years in the military like it ellicits nothing but bad emotions bc of how i saw it the rest of my life but i feel like when you see what options there are you wont even care that you have to do it for 4 years and its a fucking great way to bridge the gap between highschool and adulthood? Ig lmfao like you dont get paid a ton but you get paid a pretty decent bit and you dont really have too many expenses either so it gives you a ton of savings unless you waste it all lmfao not to mention just for the rest of your life everywhere you go everyone will be sucking your dick for being a veteran lol and also if you decide one day that you want to do something with your life that involves schooling they cover 4 years of any schooling you choose and they pay you the average cost of living wherever you are while youre in school too so you dont have to work and if you dont use it then you can let your kids use it its literally the anti college lmfao like it does so much to set you up for success its just make sure you know god damn well what youre talking about / dealing with because a lot of recruiters will try to screw you over so dont make any decisions without tons of research on your own.

Sorry i went on for so long but thats all of the advice i can think of and im not sure what of it if any would have helped you but i hope i was able to help in some capacity but either way stay strong i know this shit fucking sucks but getting to the other side is worth it and i know you can!"

depression,f37x965,t3_dg0oul,1570731331.0,Thats the most fucking ridiculous thing ive ever heard in my entire life lmfao
depression,f37ups1,t1_f37tjnq,1570730477.0,Right im gonna do everything i can i just hope it works out lol but im sure it will
depression,f37ueku,t3_dg0wyu,1570730371.0,At this point im only not too late if you already changed your mind but fuck i hope you didnt do it but im so sorry it has become so unbearable for you and i just hope wherever you are that things wont be so painful for you in the future.
AskReddit,f37s5nc,t1_f37qoe0,1570729623.0,Lmfao thats so ridiculous man haha
depression,f37rzxh,t1_f37lx10,1570729569.0,Thats so awesome my school was a lot like your original one too and thats exactly what im hoping it will be like once i move but ig we'll see lol thank you so much btw ill probably need all of the luck i can get haha
depression,f37qu17,t3_dfx5k3,1570729175.0,I know exactly what you mean and you know i mean there are other ways to give your life meaning/ make it interesting enough but for me though right now im still in that situation but i dont even care about anyone else bc i have something that im working towards and its something i actually really care about and its actually something that will work for me so im good now you know at least mentally and then i will actually be good soon but before i had the plan i do now i was just working a nothing job and the entire time i was there i was just trying to improve myself in any way that i could to make myself as ready as i could be for whatever i decided to do and i was searching and considering every single thing i could decide to work towards after a couple years i finally found something that i think i might actually be able to be happy doing regardless of anything else that might be happening or not happening in my life and i mean if you think where you are right now is your best option then disregard what i said bc i really only think that what im saying counts if your job is something you need to escape from so yeah if you need to stick with the job you have or at least something similar then im sure the other people here can help you find ways to make life more purposeful but i just wanted to point out just in case you do want to escape that there are a lot of fucking obscure jobs and possibilities out there lol and it might not be so obvious to just look for job options bc it feels like youve been pretty well educated on whats possible and what your options are in high school but they only scratch the surface and theres so much more you can find so either way i hope that you find a way to take pride in the life you lead and that you become as eager to share it as those other people you know are bc you deserve that at the very least and just know that we believe in you to make that happen.
depression,f37mqmm,t3_dfxmkk,1570727782.0,I know exactly what you mean im so numb to emotion and its impossible for me come to a solid decision or opinion on anything like it feels like the whole area of my brain dedicated to my personality is just empty and its so weird and i find myself a lot of the time involuntarily reflecting back whatever general vibes / personalities / emotions i pick up on in other people and i have no idea how to get myself to stop doing that but its like im just a human mirror and theres not actually anything inside of me when im alone you know?
depression,f37jhzq,t3_dfxhrl,1570726647.0,"I know exactly what you mean ive been struggling with isolation my whole life like there were a few people i would hang out with sometimes throughout school but i feel like i never had any real friends and its so weird ive gone through a ton of periods of not having a single person to talk to and somehow i just keep ending up right back in that same situation it doesnt matter how many people i start talking to or how often or who they are or how many different friend circles they belong to it always ends up back here at nothing. But for me though i live in a kinda small town and ive pretty much known everyone i know for at least several years and im moving very soon and i have a ton of hope that things will be so much better for me all around once i get to that new environment and i just think not only will it be a lot more conducive to making friends/ finding love, but all of the people there are new, there are a hell of a lot more people there, and i really think ill have a much easier time finding people i can relate to you know like if we all made decisions that put us in the same place at the sane time thats gotta count for something bc im 20 right now and pretty much everyone my age who hasnt moved away yet doesnt plan to so i think even just that tiny similarity could make a world of difference and what im trying to say is im always holding out hope you know everyone has their people or the place they belong out there somewhere and im not stopping looking until i find it and i really hope that you can find yours too but until then all you can really have is the same blind hope that i have and i hope its enough to hold you over and reassure you to keep looking bc i know how hard it is to hold out hope that you really dont have any reason to have but i absolutely can not imagine that it wont be worth it once i actually find my people you know.

Im really happy for you that you have your one friend though honestly that might be all you need to feel okay about all of this especially after the talk you said you had with her. Regardless though good luck to you and im sure youll find what youre looking for."
depression,f37eu81,t1_f36164p,1570725046.0,Yeah and i think ill have at least a bit better odds of finding people i can relate with more you know bc we all decided to go to the same place but here im with a ton of people who just wanna chill here so its not as easy as i think it will be.
AskReddit,f37eest,t1_f367o2v,1570724881.0,They did change the grade did they not? Tell me they changed the grade lmfao please.
depression,f3601z3,t1_f35zk1w,1570700455.0,"No even though a lot of them dont i think at least in my experience there are actually a surprising amount of women who are looking for something serious. I dont really have a good way of explaining it but ive just always been noticeably different from most other people in like my personality, interests, and values and you know ive managed to make a few pretty good friends throughout my life despite that but the relationship thing is a whole new beast lol. I think another really important factor is that im still living in my hometown in the midwest though and in a couple more months im finally moving and working towards my goals more so i think ill have a lot better odds of meeting someone more like what im looking for in that environment."
depression,f35zfzh,t1_f35za9d,1570699447.0,Yeah i absolutely feel that man lol
depression,f35z8cf,t1_f35ypqq,1570699096.0,Fr lol i do too man its crazy how much just that hope can do for me and its always really nice to see people like him find someone bc im not exactly quiet and im not overly introverted im kinda just an all around ambivert so thats not such an issue for me but im quite a god damn bit different from most people my age so its been really tough to find someone i could actually date seriously long term but i do believe that ill find them eventually though.
depression,f35yynl,t1_f35s3wx,1570698654.0,This will never cease to blow my fucking mind that like if spotify or headphones didnt exist like i just wouldnt even be alive probably man like how does it even make sense that those things alone can make everything i will ever accomplish possible
depression,f35yu2s,t1_f35ugec,1570698437.0,I never understood this it seems like every other person i know feels this way but its like my mind is always so numb already and im trying to set my mind free you know i dont want to bury it even further so it seems pretty clear that my issues affect me differently than everyone else but ive never been able to figure out why
depression,f35ynxf,t1_f35vjra,1570698146.0,I know what you mean i can not sleep without there being something playing if i had to guess i have spotify playing at least 4-5 hours a day and whenever i see my youtube stats its never under 60 hours a week lmfao
depression,f35y7qk,t1_f35vcp8,1570697376.0,Yeah fr i have no doubt it is but sometimes i just really wish i didnt have to wait anymore lol. Thats so awesome that your friend and his wife found each other though thats such a good thing.

depression,f35qa8e,t3_dfkaq5,1570685981.0,"I know exactly what you mean, the only other thing thats been able to do that for me is game grumps which is shockingly therapeutic if youre down with video games and terrible/great humor lol. Also if you want i have spent far too much of my life on Spotify so if you let me know what kind of music youre into/ helps you the most i can probably send a bit of new music your way if i listen to any of the same type of stuff. Regardless i hope it becomes easier for you to cope i know how rough that can be."

mentalhealth,f31gjqh,t3_df5ujm,1570575021.0,"The other comments here seem a hell of a lot more helpful but ill still share though if theres any chance it could help. But honestly at least for me maybe not the only way but definitely the best way would be indirectly. For me all i can think about basically all day is how much i just wish i could just end it all but i have something to live for though and it gives me enough hope to keep going bc i can die any day you know so i just keep living to see if i can make things any better while im still here. And i think thats the most important thing is just giving them as much of a reason to live as you can and literally, for me, the best way you could do that is just by literally being their friend and talking to them and being there. I dont mean talking to them about their issues, i mean literally speaking with them, and i dont mean being there to help when they need you, i mean physically being present with them whenever you can. Sure the other things are important but i feel like no one ever really acknowledges how powerful those seemingly small things can be but they mean the world to someone like me. And if youre already doing all of that then thank you and im sure that your friend appreciates you deeper than you know even if they dont say it. Thats really all i have to offer though but just i think as someone whos desperate for hope even the smallest thing can fill me with so much of it so i just hope maybe this was able to help you somehow and if not then the other comments can probably do a lot more for you and just know i believe in you."
