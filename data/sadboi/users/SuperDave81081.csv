You don't appreciate the  places both Phoenix and Ledger had to go to, to play these roles and how it changed them as a person. Jared Leto's joker was a run of a mill gangster character, almost anyone can play that role. Not to take away anything Leto did as he's a great actor and he was great in the Squad.

You get those movies everyone talks about because everyone is talking about it and it becomes a flop. This movie was amazing from the first second to the last. What doesn't get me is everyone talking about the staircase scene. In my opinion that wasn't that great compared to any other scene. Not sure why that got so much buzz. Anyways this movie really related to me that I think I might need some therapy. The one scene that spoke to me (and I hope this isn't a spoiler) was when he was in the hospital with his ""mother"" (if you saw the movie you know why I put air quotes around mother) and he says he never been happy his whole entire life. I been saying this all my life. Now do I see me being that evil? Well no, but I haven't been pushed that hard either. Great movie, going to being watching this over and over.

In your situation, stay home, but the majority of America isn't getting sick and will be perfectly fine, so it's time, we have flattened the curve.
