After three dates you know if you wanna see them again, after three months you know if you’re gonna fall in love and want to see them exclusively and lastly, by three years you should be engaged. 

Look marriage isn’t forever everyone and not everyone wants to be married and if you are happy not being marriage that’s fine.

If the landlord says pay cash rent or deposit then don’t!!

Check on the land registry to confirm the landlord actually owns the property.
