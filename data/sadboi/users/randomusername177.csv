I learned to just never talk back or stand up for myself because each time leads to my step dad having a nuclear meltdown. I can't even comment on anything on the TV because he immediately will reject my opinions, roll his eyes and sigh. The fact that I have my own thoughts and feelings pisses him off. I've had to be so boring and bland, keep to myself just to haves a tiny bit of peace. He still finds way to be angry and yell at me or put me down, but not as much. I struggle so fucking much in social situations to talk, I usually give up most of the time. I'm a introvert but I still crave someone to talk to and not feel lonely sometimes. It's just hard having so much emotions bottled up and not being able to voice them in a healthy way. I've got years and years worth of things I never told anyone."
Hashimotos,fostrvw,t3_g9ajp4,1588037884.0,"i feel this so much. I'm so tired of that line. ""Just do this, just do that"".  Some people mean well, others I think want to 'try' to help so they go ""look at me, look at the help I do for people. I'm a good person!"". I hardly ever open up anymore because of it. From depression, to anxiety, most people don't take the time to listen to what you have to say. One person I told I had Hashimotos, they thought I made it up as an excuse for my problems. Like, wtf? Or when people try to one up you and say they have something worse and ignore you completely. People seriously lake any sense of empathy or sympathy for anyone. I even wonder if I should comment because of how judgmental everyone is. Your feelings are validated and matter. Others need to recognize each person has had different experiences and are different people from each other. What works for one won't work for another."
depression,foiqf0p,t3_g7mqo9,1587793725.0,"I'm so sorry you are feeling this way. I feel the same and would not wish it on anyone. The excuse I use is pretty much the same. ""I'm tired"" ""I'm stressed"" ""I'm okay, just exhausted"" etc. When saying these thing, and faking that smile, it can be just as tiring trying to pretend you're okay so people don't ask questions, give you unsolicited advice you've heard 100 times over, or just straight up leave you. It fucking sucks. I wish I could give you a big bear hug and help you feel better. Just know I hear you and you matter. Lately, I been researching some supplements to help give me energy to do things, as I also have some medical conditions that contribute to the fatigue.

depression,foipozt,t3_g7net4,1587793103.0,"I feel you. It took me a really long time (years) to get close to people again and trying to be social. I thought I was doing well, considering everything that has happened to me. Well the other evening, someone I was talking to asked me why I was so stressed and silly me, opened up just a tiny bit and they ran away. I'm so naive and think people actually care about me til I am always proved wrong. Then I wind up in that cycle of sinking deeper into a black hole. You're right though. No one wants to be friends with someone depressed. Years ago I had 'friends' and I always was there for them. When things got bad for me they ALL BAILED and I never heard from them again. So sick of people saying I need to reach out or ask for help. I wish people would just fucking listen instead of trying to talk to me like i'm 5 years old and how i need to go outside or drink more water. I need a real friend who will listen and who cares. So hard to find these days.   Sorry for the rant there. We're all in this together trying our best."

I wish we lived in a society where our prescriptions and medical supplies were affordable or even free, but that's not the way it is here. The upside to my doctor giving me the injection is that she is trained and knowledgeable in how to give them. I'm no nurse, I never had to give myself an injection. Sure I could ask her how to show me, but again at the end of day i'd be paying something either way. My original comment to OP was that i simply mentioned that they could have PA and then I was getting attacked in the comments that ""it's not this, you don't have that"". Wtf?

I think he has some depression too, and honestly can relate to him a bit. I will defend this game until I die. Really underrated, and wish people gave it a chance.

Also, I really liked Final Fantasy 10. Yuna is my favorite female in any Final Fantasy. She's sad but tries so hard to keep going to help save the world and follow in her fathers foot steps. The  music, scenery, everything is great.

blackberry,fgufh54,t3_f0bepx,1581119511.0,"I'm really interested, but like the other user commented, I am worried about not reaching the middle keys with my thumbs. I cannot remember the last slider I owned to be honest and would need to get a feel for it. I'm still loving my Priv and typing feels second nature to me on it. If Blackberry makes a comeback, I would be so thrilled! Until then, the only choice is the Pro 1 for me."
blackberry,fgri0dt,t1_fgrh3zk,1581047301.0,"I'm sorry your Priv was stolen! That's awful :(  I love my Priv and is my favorite phone I ever owned. I have some heating issues, and sometimes it restarts by itself which is very annoying. My USB port somehow became damaged but thankfully I can charge it via wireless. Didn't think the price tag was worth it, though. However even with all the flaws, I really loved how you got the full touch screen to play games and watch Netflix, then slide the keyboard out to text without sacrificing the screen. I agree with you though! I really hope something like it comes out in the future but more reliable and less issues. My dream was a Priv 2, but I may have to go for the Pro 1 if nothing comes out soon from anyone else."
blackberry,fgqz5ny,t1_fgqljz3,1581034617.0,"I hope you get it soon! With the time you're waiting they should send you two lol! Let me know how you like it whenever it comes. I watched YouTube videos on it, however I'd like an actual Blackberry user (and a Priv at that) to give a review."
blackberry,fgqejwq,t3_ezyejr,1581022659.0,"Until my Priv dies, I will keep using it. I need a physical keyboard in my life!! I been looking at the F(x)tec Pro1 like it a lot if I need to upgrade. However, not a big fan of landscape sliders.  I wonder, with the end of BB smartphones, if another company might rise out of their ashes and replace them."
FinalFantasyVIII,fgkkpz1,t3_ez0l2p,1580867820.0,"KEEP:

1. I agree, keep the character design. I was so annoyed how they changed Squall in the remaster.
2. The original music has to be there. FF8 has some of the best music out of all the Final Fantasy games. 
3. Triple Triad. 

CHANGES:

1. The junction and draw system I feel like could use an upgrade
2. Also agree about more dialogue and cut scenes to flesh out the game a bit more

I hope that if the rumors are true and they are working on doing a remake like 7, that they listen to the fans of FFVIII. I fee like there is always some unwarranted hate towards this game, meanwhile our voices get drown out among the foaming at the mouth haters. I feel like not a lot of people gave this game a chance it deserves."
depression,fghazcf,t3_eydhsq,1580780784.0,Same here for me. These words don't do anything to help me. In fact they annoy the hell out of me because I feel like how I feel doesn't matter at all to anyone. They have these saying on repeat because putting in effort beyond quotes from fakebook or instagram is too much for them.
eczema,fgff36n,t3_ey6wf5,1580736867.0,"I'm so sorry you are having a full body flare right now. I cannot even imagine the pain and the terrible itchiness all over. I hope you can find relief soon. Your list is very creative and a cool idea. I can relate to a couple of them!

The worst for me is my left nipple and breast. I don't know why that one and not the right one, but damn when it itches, I can't help but try to scratch it raw. I've put Eucerin on it when it gets bad and helps a lot. When it flares though, it's the worst.

Next would be the corners of my eyes and eye lids. I'm constantly rubbing them, scratching to get the flakes out so they don't fall in my eyes or get on my glasses. I get the eczema the worst in this area and seems to be always active.

My scalp would be third. Now it's not exactly eczema that is on my scalp, it's actually psoriasis. Both my dad and brother have it too. Lucky for them, they can shave their head. My head is itchy quite often and I have a patch near my forehead and hair line that seems to always be there, and it's red and flakey.  The itch here drives me insane because no matter how much I scratch the itch won't go away. I have to use special shampoo and apple cider vinegar rinses to calm it down."
freefolk,fgevwe1,t1_fge7y8x,1580712030.0,"As a woman, you're 100% right. Genetics matter too, but hormones going out of wack all the time doesn't help. I can relate to Shireen  though. I have eczema and psoriasis that I need to manage all the time lol"
depression,fgevgkq,t3_exzmxb,1580711530.0,"I'm so terribly sorry for the horrible things that have happened to you. No one should have to go thru what you have, and be treated like that by your own family. You're so strong for going to therapy and trying so hard. Having the motivation to get help, and try your best in school despite how you feel, is inspiring. 

My depression is similar to yours. The environment that I live in is 90% why I'm depressed. My step father is emotionally abusive and has narcissist traits. For years I was led to believe what a horrible, ungrateful daughter I am. But the truth was, HE was the problem. My feelings have never mattered. Thoughts and opinions? Not allowed. I have been so fucked up because of what he's caused and the worst part is people believe him because in public hes a great guy. Besides, he pays for the roof over my head so it's okay for him to abuse me /s. 

A year ago, I found the r/raisedbynarcissists subreddit and it changed everything. I wasn't the crazy one. I wasn't alone. There is so many things I could share, but it'd be pages and pages long. I'd recommend checking the sub out, it helped me so much. Knowing your feelings and experiences can be validated and getting support helps a lot. 

My depression is so bad that I'm exhausted ALL the time. It's so bad that I thought I had Chronic Fatigue syndrome. I do have some other health issues where fatigue is a symptom but I on't have health insurance. I want to go back to school so badly, but I'm so tired. It seems like I'll never be able to leave and get a place of my own. I'm 27 and trapped because I am not financially independent, and taking care of my mom and dog. 

Anyway sorry for my little rant. I hope one day I can be strong like you and find the motivation to work on going to school again. Student loan debt is absolutely terrifying though, on top of medical bills. UGH."
depression,fgd9tz8,t1_fga6kqu,1580680250.0,"There ARE people who truly have no one, and calling those people vain is, well, rude like you said. If those of us who had someone, really had someone who cared, they would actually make the effort of, well, giving a shit. They cannot treat us like garbage when we are alive, then turn around and say they cared if we died."
Anxiety,fgd8fio,t3_exuw3g,1580679953.0,"I'm so lonely as well. It's strange because I do like being alone, or I guess having alone time. Reading, video games, afternoon naps lol. But having someone to share things you love, meaningful conversations and just someone being there would be nice. I had someone like that, and he left. I miss him terribly."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fgczdxq,t3_exurd9,1580677567.0,"Super Bowl is one of the most ridiculous things that people spend money on. Companies pay millions for 10 -30 second commercials that won't matter after a few days. No one should spend that much money for commercials, wtf? All the celebrities and fanfare over people kicking and running with a ball for a few hours while players get injured, fans foaming at the mouth if their team loses. I hate it all! And if you dare say you don't like football, I'm told ""how can you be a true American if you don't like Football!?"".  Can' t I dislike something and not be ridiculed to the ends of the earth for it? Why should I be shamed for not liking football? or any sport?"
blackberry,fgcw8pk,t3_ext8iw,1580676779.0,"Typing long emails, text messages with complete sentences or anything related to typing, is so much easier with a PKB. I've tried with my moms phone a few times using the glass screen but my fingers end up hitting all kinds of letters, I touch A when the phone some how thinks I touched Z. I can't keep hitting the back button over and over just to type. Drives me insane. It's like typing on a computer. You're so used to the layout of the keyboard that you can type fast and accurately without having to look at the keyboard hardly at all. That's how I am with my Priv. I can type fast, accurately, without looking at the keys half the time. No need for random auto correct or having to hit the back button 100 times to type 3 words."

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fg5uvf0,t3_ewvvew,1580539832.0,"I have been really into ColourPop lately. I used to be a big fan of Wet n Wild but they got caught lying about being cruelty free and had to step back from them. CP is cruelty free and has great prices, and a ton of collabs. I bought the Zero to Hero (Megara inspired) make up set and use it all the time. It came with a berry lip and a lavender highlighter. 

Another I love is the Mother of Dragons highlighter kit from Urban Decay. I wanted it since it came out and a friend of mine got it for me as a gift! So in love with it! 

Mascara, I have 3 that I use from Essence. They are a great drugstore brand and my lashes look great!"
eczema,fg5tlsp,t1_fg5s5w4,1580538401.0,"I will look into that shampoo and see if it helps some. The worst is the itchy feeling and not being able to scratch it the way you would on, say your arm or leg. I'm glad it is working for you so you don't have to deal with that! :)

I always wondered why eczema goes where it does. From the arms as a kid, to the face or scalp. I bet it feels so much better though without the hair in the way to really take care of it on your head!"
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fg5tanm,t1_fg5s7vv,1580538078.0,"She is still in this stage where she feels like a lot of things are her fault. He makes us feel that way a lot. Narcissists use a lot of manipulation and gas lighting and as a result we  always second guess ourselves. I tried getting her to see it, and I think part of her does. Lots of mental and emotional damage can make people not see it. It took me years to figure out it wasn't me, but it was him, that was the problem.  I'm working on going back to school so I can get a better job to be finally financially independent and move out with my mom and dog. Other wise if we left now we'd be homeless. My brother lives on the other side of the country and have no contact with extended family. Anyway, sorry for going so dark! I thought it might also help and bring awareness if anything!"
worldnews,fg5qzcf,t1_fg5h6g6,1580535689.0,"I read the book *In Order to Live* by Yeonmi Park , which is about her and her mother who fled North Korea. They were forced to go thru China to get to South Korea and it is a very dangerous path. I read the book in one night, it was so heartbreaking and captivating to read. People end up getting lost in China, sold as sex slaves, are raped and traded like cattle. It's disgusting. Many who flee to China never make it to South Korea."
eczema,fg5qdnd,t3_ex0gnw,1580535115.0,"I'm sorry you have to deal with this awful affliction. I do want to thank you for sharing this though, as I find it interesting. I had eczema on my arms as a kid and it now is gone, but appears on my face and ears. My scalp has psoriasis however (both my dad and brother have it). I always was curious to know what my shaved head would look like. I'm too scared though. I'm a woman and the thought of getting rid of all my hair is too much to handle. One thing that helped though is Apple Cider Vinegar hair rinses for the patches on the scalp."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fg5mfgv,t3_ewxhz5,1580531544.0,"My recent birthday, January 7th was the worst in a long time. For some context, my step dad is emotionally abusive and has narc traits. My mom and I do everything around the house, especially cooking. Well that day he wanted to make himself (him, not us, him) tuna casserole. My mom and I hate tuna and he knows this. He got so mad at us because we didn't go over the moon to praise him on it and how amazing it was. We were going to make a home made meal for all of us, it being my birthday, it'd be something I could pick. He just ate a huge pan full of this casserole and wasn't hungry and there for, my mom and I shouldn't be (he legit thinks this way). Anyway, there was so much fighting and arguing all night about this dumb ass casserole, then it turned into other things, about him. He listed things he hated and was pissed about, wouldn't let us speak at all, he threw things, broke my moms Google Pixel in pieces. He demanded that we pay attention and listen to how upset he was. But when my mom and I are upset, we are not allowed. He calls me a snowflake and too sensitive if I even show cracks of my depression. Anyway, spent my birthday hungry, crying and alone in my bed all night. Sorry it is not a comedy or something funny. 

For anyone reading and think they know someone like my step dad, check on the subreddit 'raisedbynarcissists ""."
raisedbynarcissists,fg4izx1,t3_ewoj1k,1580504233.0,"I feel the same. If I make any noise at all, I need to be yelled at to be quiet. My step dad is so loud but I cannot say anything. He likes to watch horror movies late at night, so when I'm trying to sleep all I hear is people screaming and being murdered on the TV. I hate horror, cannot stand the thought, sight or sound of people being killed in brutal ways and he knows it. Also the stomping, slamming, loud everything you can think of. Everyone has to know that hes here and to pay attention to him! I try to be as quiet as possible. Sometimes people in public are surprised because I hardly make any noise at all."
SkincareAddiction,fg2pc4j,t3_ewauj6,1580450731.0,"Wow, I was just looking at Skintegra a while back when looking for a new moisturizer.

VeganBeauty,ffq170g,t3_eujz44,1580114775.0,"I liked the Strong and Long shampoo. I have really long, fine hair and I feel like it does a decent job. I have scalp psoriasis and doesn't bother it at all. I am interested in trying the Banana Love Deep Intensive Moisture Mask though. I have been unable to find it at Target or Ulta sadly. 

Also, I have tried the Cosmic Shield Hydration Lock Face Cream. Unfortunately, it was not a winner for my skin. I have combo skin, but leans more dry (have eczema around my eyes too) but it left a lot to be desired in the hydration department. It smells really fragrant and was turned off by that as well. I mostly was interested by the fact it had hemp in it. Ended up giving it to my mom and she likes it, but her skin is not a problematic as mine is."
