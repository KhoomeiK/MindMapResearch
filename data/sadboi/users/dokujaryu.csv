I bet if I tweak the MTU and message size I can get another 5 or so out of it to get into the 90s. For some reason I remember benchmarking these cards at sustained 92gigs, but I may have been wrong. 

I was looking at getting a Ryzen 3950x system with PCI-E 4, but I’d have to also find an IB card that supports it."

AFAIK you cannot saturate 16 lanes with 100gbits as it is 128gbits of bandwidth. And I’m getting way over 8x at 85 gbits. That being said, I was trying to find out if the 8GT you get per lane is duplex or not. But that being said ib_read_bw and write won’t exceed 85gbits either."
networking,fnzpnry,t1_fnzk83u,1587398518.0,"I've tried 3 MTUs, 1024, 4096, and 9000. Performance gets *worse* as MTU goes up, at least in ib\_send\_bw with a payload size of 65535. Maybe if I craft the payload to be just under one 9000 bytes frame. 

To be fair, I'm getting an extremely consistent 85gbits each direction or 168 gbits bidirectional, which is you know, 85% of what is advertised so I probably shouldn't complain. I'm really just wondering if this loss is expected and normal at this point. I've seen a few people getting 15 - 20 gbits each direction while looking around. The cable is pretty clean as well, I don't know how it degrades in performance though. 

The CPUs on both systems have one core pegged at 100%, but when I tried to run two at once I just got half speed and had two cores pegged at 100%, so that's not very encouraging. If it's hardware, I wonder if it's memory speed, as RDMA is writing to the memory of the app, maybe that's just as fast as it can possibly write to one of the boxes. Both boxes have 8, 8 GB DDR-4 sticks, one side at 3200 CL14 one is DDR4 JDEC speeds. 

But my concern is if Ubuntu 20.04 is too new and is causing issues. I'm considering trying CentOS 8.1, but I need ZFS support and 20.04 is LTS and is using an LTS kernel and has ZFS without installing any modules, so it's extremely attractive. Both machines are clean installs of 20.04 but there was some package disagreement on perftools, with apt having the newer version of verbs and perf than the actual OFED driver. I can go down to 19.10, which also has ZFS or I can go across to CentOS 8.1 + KDE + OpenZFS."

I do monitor, but the only suspicious thing I'm seeing is ib\_send\_bw is using 100% CPU. I ran two at once and got 85gbits per instance with both instances also at 100% so it doesn't seem to matter, but I'm not sure."

If you don’t care much about those things then it doesn’t matter. Just get something FreeNAS compatible and go wild. Or just plug an external hard drive into your router, as most routers support that kind of thing. 

However, I’m doing a 10 drive double parity ZFS on a Xeon file server with ECC memory and 10gig LAN for housing family photos, videos, backups, Steam/Blizzard/Origin game installs, etc. It runs a stable version of Ubuntu Server with kernel support for Open ZFS with AES encryption.  I do offsite backups of critical data. 

As far as what quality is important, they all are. Crappy LAN cards will make for a bad experience of storing and retrieving. Slow storage same. Not enough drives will result in lost data. Slow CPU will choke on encryption, compression or server side backups to offsite.  Low amounts of memory will result in extremely poor performance during large file or multi user access. Again, if you don’t care about any of that and just want a network drive that works, you can do whatever you want. If you are planning on editing large movie files over the network while someone plays a video game off a mounted drive, you’re gonna have a bad time with low and slow core counts, low memory, bad / slow SATA drives, and network interfaces."

The coil over thing really bugs me as it’s a lot of money and since I’m not hardcore track racing or lowering my car, the $1000 seems to mostly be to allow adjustments. I can see more direct benefit in wheels, tires, supercharger, clutch, and tune, but everyone seems to go coil overs first. Probably cause they lower. 

I looked at the KW V1s but they don’t have click adjustment, which everyone seems to want and the V3s seem to track focused with features I won’t use. At least TEIN is Japanese and has domestic service and the Flex A does have a feature I can reasonably see as occasionally beneficial with the hydraulic bump stops on potholes.

ft86,fefxjak,t1_feeuc1j,1579068508.0,"Yeah, you're right, it's not like I don't agree. I've had my share of blown 4 cyls to go 0-60 in. I'm just looking and learning. I readily admit don't know shit about wheels and suspensions. 

&#x200B;

One thing I'm trying to avoid some bad mojo I had with a Mazdaspeed MX-5 with fairly low profile tires (3"" sidewall) that ruined the ride. Doing the math, stock sidewall height on 215/45/17 is 3.8"", and sidewall height on 245/40/17 is 3.9"" vs 255/40/18 is 4"", so ride comfort from tire sidewall flex should be fine with any of those options I suppose. The 04' MSM wheels bent and punctured (yes the wheel) and cost me a ton. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, I don't like being that guy who just talks about what he might do to the car, but I do eventually plan on putting a supercharger on it, so maybe some of the width concerns might make more sense. Based on what I'm hearing tho, I'm adjusting my budget for a set of street / track coilovers and some lightweight wheels with PS4S. I was just planning on starting with wheels and tires since supercharger is the most expensive part. Seems like coilovers need to come at the same time as wheels and tires. Then again, unsprung will be a bit lower with 17x8 with 245/40s vs. 18s. Tread width of 225/45/17 is 7.5"", while 245/40/17 is 8.3"" and 255/40/18 8.8"". Doing all the math I get with PS4S

17x7.5 (stock) + 225/45 = 22 (I think?) lbs + 21lbs \* 4 = 172 lbs. Or 23lbs per inch of tread width.

17x8 245/40 = 16lbs + 22lbs \* 4 = 152 lbs. Or 18.3lbs per inch of tread width.

18x9.5 255/35 = 18lbs + 23lbs \* 4 = 164 lbs. Or 18.6lbs per inch of tread width.

&#x200B;

Lower power engine is going to do better with lower rotational / unsprung mass, I'm not planning on upgrading the brembo brake kit, but I guess I could throw some slotted / drilled rotors in there as well. Maybe I'm over-optimizing for unsprung weight, but it seems to be important. On the other hand, with 18x9.5s I'd have a lot more tire options available to me, since it seems 17s aren't really in style these days. Still tho, you are right, if I just got these Primacy HP 215/45s off and just threw some 225/45 PS4S on there, I'd probably never know the difference and save a ton of money. It's not like the Performance rims are awful anyway. 

&#x200B;

As far as lowering, I'm not looking to like drop the car down much. What I mean is I'm not intentionally going for a low look. Whatever makes sense for the coilover performance, sure, just as long as it is adjustable for autocross and back up for our terrible streets. I don't find the stock height on the stock wheels offensive or anything."
ft86,fecxcc1,t1_fec3x6f,1578988408.0,"So, just to follow up on this, the TC 105x comes in 5x100 in 

* 17x8 +42  0.31"" closer (spacers)
* 17x9 +35 0.04"" closer (perfect fit)
* 18x8 +45 0.43"" closer (spacers)
* 18x8.5 +43 0.35"" closer (spacers)
* 18x9.5 +45 0.43"" closer (spacers)

The 17x9 +35 just fits perfectly as in the inside of the wheel and tire sit exactly in the same place. So I think that's why people go for it with the 245/40 tire. It also allows you to potentially upgrade to 255/40 after some fender rolling? Maybe the rears can take that wide without fender rolling? Dunno. The 17x8 with the Pilot Sport 4 S 245 would be the lowest weight. 

This guy did the TC 105N 17x9 with 245s and his wheel wells look pretty stuffed. But he also did coilovers.

overclocking,fb0paxq,t3_eaxn4d,1576428081.0,"I have the same setup. The GPU can go higher, but I wasn’t stable with memory over 550+ with GPU at 170+. Memory won’t change much, so I suggest you set the memory to stock and go as high as possible on GPU before pushing memory. That being said, I’ve never seen 500+ not working. 

I recommend 3dmark stability test to ensure stable frames instead of max FPS possible. Micro stutter sucks.

overclocking,faurkqt,t1_f977u6f,1576351876.0,Thanks for the tip on moving up to 1900 fabric. I was able to run at 3800 CL 16 with very tight timings and drive my latency down to 64.8 with 57GB reads. OCing the fabric increased performance in other ways as well.
PleX,fauapm5,t3_eaeqxy,1576346372.0,I just got mine installed after god knows how long of getting a tech out who would actually do the work and run the damn line. Soooooo fast tho.
overclocking,f98uu5l,t1_f977u6f,1575183203.0,Oh I thought if you went over 1800 fabric it wasn’t stable. Maybe it’s 1900
overclocking,f96q6js,t1_f94yd1i,1575149787.0,"Yeah, I think that was the extreme setting in the timing utility. I didn't try those cause I like to keep the Fabric clock the same as the memory clock ."
PleX,f93hbc6,t1_f938870,1575059052.0,"None. The TV agent updates the metadata, but the players don’t support reading it. iOS Plex agent has the extras button per episode, but nothing else I have used has it. 

I’ve been considering the following options:

- Use mkvmerge to append the deleted scenes to the end of the episode. Or have it as an alternate video track or something crazy. 

- manage the metadata myself after the initial import. 

- merge ALL the deleted scenes into one season extra (which it seems the players also don’t support) 

- Use Kodi when I want to see deleted scenes??? 

- Use playlists?"
PleX,f91lckd,t1_f91h5m0,1574993550.0,"That worked, but it seems the web client doesn't support extras on TV episodes, but the iOS client does. Is there also some plugin to add extras for TV shows to the web client?"
PleX,f91h5m0,t1_f90yamd,1574989855.0,This is it exactly! I'll try it!
PleX,f91h28n,t1_f90hzri,1574989775.0,I'm doing that for specials as well. But there's per episode extras on the tv show I'm importing.
PleX,f91h17z,t1_f90hmss,1574989751.0,"I did that, but unlike movies, the deleted scenes don't show up under the episode as ""extras""."

overclocking,f8tzbpi,t1_f8twnzf,1574815070.0,"I got 66ns / 54000 MB/s with 2T GDM on.

I tried for another half hour to get it on 1T, but no go. I went to 1.5v on memory, 1.125v on SOC, higher VDC etc. etc. I think if I relax the CL from 14 to 15 it will go, but I doubt it's worth it. I guess I could try pushing to 1.6v?  I have a 3600, so not the fastest Ryzen anyway. Maybe a 3800x would do it. 

It does CL14 2T GDM at 1.4v and Auto on SOC VDDC. It's rated at 3600 CL15."
overclocking,f8tu6x3,t1_f8tty27,1574811327.0,"What performance test should I run? I usually run Passmark. 

What am I looking for with GDM enabled / disabled?"
overclocking,f8ttgkj,t1_f8th3fp,1574810879.0,"04213X8810B

Here's the timings. Just reconfirmed that it will not work at 1T. I ran 6 instances of memtest to 300% with no errors. So it's pretty stable. The CMD rate at 2T vs 1T doesn't seem to be a big performance boost according to others.

apple,f6v8j40,t1_f6u5pet,1573179418.0,"It’s significantly worse than thumbnails. He regularly gives a platform to to people to spread absolute biased nonsense. He literally had someone on a podcast say that Apple cpus being faster was not important cause everyone makes apps for 4 year old android devices. This same fuckwad suggested that you KEEP your exploding Samsung Note cause he didn’t see anything wrong with it. AND he acted like Apple wasn’t acting properly to deny his repair request when he had an employee disassemble and electric shock the motherboard with a power supply discharge. He repeatedly gives Samsung a pass for making phones that become literally unusable due to hardware fault and harps endlessly on things that don’t work like they do on android (but do work) as reasons to avoid iPhone. 

It is NOT just thumbnails and clickbait. His whole company exhibits a pro-android and pro-windows bias. Which is fine, his content about server hardware and networking and overbuilding and proconsumer PC parts is great. But watching any of his “reviews” is a waste of time. You know exactly what agenda he’s going to push before you watch it. You’d get a less biased review of Obama on Fox News."
overclocking,f5cta83,t1_f5c3afz,1572140896.0,I’d prefer to stick with multiples of 100 but 4000 CL 17 is attractive. But ultimately I’m looking at those 2nd levels and they seem really high compared to tight timings.
