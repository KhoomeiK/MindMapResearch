sexual_assault,fnchqtw,t3_g0iqyi,1586837055.0,"It will take time. Just be sure to communicate with your current part about what you're feeling. Sex isn't the only way to connect and show love so maybe for now explore other areas of your relationship. 

As for why it took you so long for you to realize you were forced, I would say that up until recently our society had conditioned us to view your experiences as normal and even good (from the guy's point of view). Top that with the fact that nobody wants to believe they're a victim and it makes sense you reacted how you did. 

I have also struggled with how I lost my virginity, it can be a really hard thing. Sending healing e-hugs."

Your husband and you should have watched your kids better but that's not what makes you TA (it is difficult to watch them every minute). I know I wasn't there but it does sound like you overreacted with calling an ambulance. Idk how insurance works where you live but you probably could have called to see if it could be covered first. I might have just watched them to see how they were doing after or taken an uber to a walk in clinic. Your husband is TA for putting this on you (if he disagreed with ambulance he should have spoken up at the time). And owner is TA for having a dangerous machine unlocked... but enough to sue him idk... guy is just trying to make money renting out his home. He made a mistake but it seems that the ambulance ride was unnecessary so why make him pay the bill? My ruling is YWBTA.

AskParents,evpnqs3,t3_cknr37,1564677015.0,"It is difficult but being firm that the behavior is wrong, modeling kind behavior,  and helping them develop better strategies to get what they want will pay off. It just takes time.

My daughter went through this phase and is now getting better. Daniel tiger is a good show for modeling behavior (though obviously limit screen time).

One more thing is sometimes kids learn they get attention for negative behavior which reinforces the behavior. When my daughter would bite my son I would always first tend to my son and make a show of making sure he was ok, saying something like ""wow it wasn't nice being bitten"" or the like. Only after he was calm would I direct my attention to my daughter and ask what happened. I think this also gave her time to calm down and understand the consequences of her actions. I would say something like ""you really hurt [brother]. I know how much you love him so why did you hurt him?"". There is always a reason and while it may seem trivial to us toddlers are still learning to be human and need direction.

I hope this helps. I also came to this sub for help with this problem previously so just passing on what worked. Of course every child is different and I am sure you will find what works for your son."
