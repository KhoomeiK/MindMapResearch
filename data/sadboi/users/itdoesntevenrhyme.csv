There are so many things I'm anxious about. The new equipment and possibly making a fool out of myself for using it wrong. But especially, meeting all the new people that will cook there as well. Will they try to talk to me? Will I seem weird? Will they ask inquisitive questions about my food?

Last year I was living in a shared flat. And there was one guy who really liked criticizing my vegan food. Almost everytime I cooked he talked shit and once put raw chicken in front of my face ""to taste it."" I've never pushed him my beliefs, I've never even told him myself that I'm vegan, he was the one to ask. And that made my anxiety in this area even worse. It fucking sucks.

I hope to get better tho. I've recently got on meds for depression and social anxiety and regularly attend therapy."

Tablespoon of oil (or even less) to fry these onions won't clog your arteries, smh. So little fat can be even dangerous for people with ovaries as it is important to maintain their normal function. Period can be lost from not having enough fat in one's diet. Thank god that at least almonds were used here.

VeganFoodPorn,eudbymb,t1_etpq832,1563711858.0,"Sorry, quite late to this lol, but here's the recipe anyway, it's super easy:

&#x200B;

I pan-fried approximately 5 cloves of cut-up garlic - can be less, but I like me a lot of it. Added salt, pepper and chilli flakes. When the garlic was golden, I poured in vegan cream (200ml) - tried it with soy one and oat one, all of them work. 

Once it starts to bubble it's a good moment to put in some vegan cheese - Violife mozzarella style is really good. But it's not needed, I often cook it without the cheese and just wait for the cream to thicken a bit and then throw in the spinach, kale is great too. Then just add in the pasta and it's done. Sometimes when I want it a bit more healthy and nutritious I add some more green veggies, some protein like tempeh or vegan chicken and whole-wheat or spelt pasta."

RECIPE:

I felt wild and experimented with not measuring anything but I'll try to give you at least somewhat close numbers.

Creamed together about 150g (cca 2/3 cup) of vegan butter with, I guess, a cup of sugar (half caster, half cane, doesn't matter tho I guess.) Added a generous pinch of salt, a bit more than a teaspoon of vanilla extract and like 2-3 tbsp of plant milk. Then sifted approximately 2 cups of flour into it with 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Finished by throwing a whole cut-up bar of dark chocolate in.

Put it into fridge for an hour, then made balls, squished them down and baked those babies for 12 minutes on 180°C (350°F). It's important to let them cool down, they come out super delicate and soft but harden with cooling."
