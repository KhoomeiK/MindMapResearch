God took the wrong one was a joke, and I've said this countless times, yet you continue to put an inordinate amount of weight behind it and despite acknowledging I don't actually wish harm upon others you continue to prop it up as more than a joke for some reason. 

You also continue to act as if I'm speaking objectively when I've never once said that my word is law. AGAIN, I'm giving my opinion. You're giving yours. 

Impact is actually a very good tool because it's indicative of how unique their art was and how powerful it was to other artists. Not necessarily that it was good or bad."

Again, this was a joke. You can wonder what would've happened without wishing it would come true. Ideally, both John and Yoko would've survived, but a timeline where Yoko dies is particularly interesting because of how it would've impacted John's art, PURELY from an artistic standpoint.

This is coming from a super non-assertive guy: you just have to take what you want from life. Like actually go out and take it. If your family doesn't support you fuck em, there has got to be some friend, relative, grad student studying mental health, online forum, etc that can help. Unfortunately, despite feeling like you don't wanna do anything and like you might not even be worth the effort, that's the only way it'll improve.

That's not on We, the People. That's on Hillary, her advisors, the DNC, and the Establishment in general for getting cocky and thinking they could shell out a weak candidate to beat the big, orange buffoon. We need a GOOD candidate this time around that gets people to the polls and gets people goin'! AKA Bernie 

Btw, I don't disagree that Hillary would have been far and away a better president than Trump. HOWEVER, there's a huge difference between HRC as a potential president and HRC as a candidate. While a decent potential president given her experience, HRC was an abysmal candidate and couldn't beat a narcissistic spray-tanned idiot with goose eggs for political savvy and experience."

I totally agree that working locally is a decisive way to shape policy, but I also think that the 'until then' argument falls short when met with the fact that this has been our situation for far too long already and it's unlikely to change if we continue to settle for corporate neo-liberal phonies.

Let's be real, beating Trump is a lay-up victory (SHOULD'VE been a lay-up victory but HRC couldn't get people to the polls), and the winner of this election, much like the previous election, will be the 'change' candidate. The change candidate here is not a Joe Biden or a Pete Butthole, but a Bernie or an Andrew Yang. These are the only candidates that are touching on issues that swayed voters to Trump in 2016, and the only candidates that offer a legitimate populist perspective, which is very clearly what wins elections at this point in time. 

Mark my words, if Joe Biden wins the nomination we will see another 4 years of Donald J. Trump."
