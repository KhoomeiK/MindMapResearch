GalaxyS9,fprd9qj,t3_gf3xbb,1588850859.0,I just got my phone for Christmas. I had a 4000mah battery on my last phone so this was a shock. My battery will go from 100 to 38 in about 6 hours. I say 38 because I never let it get lower than that. I used to try charging o ly to 80 but AccuBattery stopped alerting me for some reason. It's a pretty crummy battery. But I can't get a new phone anytime soon. Probably for 2 years. So I just gotta charge it twice a day. Sigh...
