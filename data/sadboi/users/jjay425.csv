lonely,f5tj50u,t3_dp2w8f,1572459721.0,Sad isn't it
lonely,f5tj0dj,t3_dp8jpk,1572459648.0,I know that feeling too well
lonely,f5o7yzw,t3_doa9wv,1572311963.0,It's so hard. We often lose ourselves in our relationships. It takes time to heal. Unfortunately we can't wake up tomorrow feeling better. Sorry things are so hard for you now.
lonely,f5o7ek9,t3_dobpml,1572311613.0,I feel this way all the time. All the time people walk by me like I'm not there and have a conversation like I'm not in the room. It's hard and I'm sorry
SuicideWatch,f240rmg,t3_dbqe9r,1569942277.0,I am the same. Some people look for exits when they walk in a room but I well.... I guess it's a different type of exit
SuicideWatch,f2403yz,t3_dbrviv,1569941840.0,I do too. I also always find myself on here. I woke up this morning and it was one of those nights when you sleep so peaceful and you wonder if this is what death is like
lonely,f1hxuv7,t3_d98loe,1569502717.0,I feel this way but I push people away all the time.
SuicideWatch,ezlzdzt,t3_d1dvpv,1567983944.0,Same
SuicideWatch,ezlyxno,t3_d1fx4w,1567983738.0,"I say that about my organs. Instead of rotting them through a shitty suicide, how about I go to the hospital and they take them. Give them to people that are loved and matter."
SuicideWatch,ezlygnd,t3_d1e0sc,1567983514.0,I feel the same. I'm older and don't live with my parents but there are no shopping trips with Mom or lunches with Dad. I occasionally get a text from my mother not telling me she misses me or loves me or anything but normally something dumb like you got a letter here. I wish my partner was that person but I'm 3rd to 4th at best. I hope you find that person. I know how much it hurts to have no one.
lonely,euwg3d1,t3_cfqn0v,1564074820.0,That's very kind of you but I know deep down that I should. I've put this off way too long now.
lonely,ereq2d5,t3_c1m0b0,1560790204.0,Thank you. Today has been hard. It's nice to know that there are good people like you around.
lonely,eoa1n7o,t3_bq1pge,1558405213.0,Agreed. Pretty much me all day.
lonely,eoa1fir,t3_br0bx3,1558405099.0,Sounds like you are a good dad and I hope your family appreciates that. It's hard being in a world full of so many people but here we are alone.
lonely,eoa0ugk,t3_br3zfc,1558404776.0,I agree. I spend all day inside my head.
lonely,eoa0mpa,t3_br1q5r,1558404649.0,I feel like I've missed out alot too. I've always did what I was supposed to do but never really thought about what makes me happy. I spend most of my day and night alone so I get it.
