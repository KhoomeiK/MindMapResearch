But that's not necessarily the case when people who exhibit common clusters of responses to our society's authoritarian mental health system use that label to find others and to build solidarity with them. I identify quite strongly with some psychiatric labels because the clusters of criteria helped me to explain certain traumas in my life as well as to better comprehend how I act and react to common pressures in life."

A principled critique of anything is good. 

Sometimes, however, anti-psychiatry becomes an ablest, libertarian, neo-darwinism, where my tangible, lived, mental health challenges are dismissed as either a moral or social failure to be happy in a world that is hostile to our existence. Frankly, I think that being happy (or should I perhaps say ""carefree""?) in this world is just as pathological as being overly sensitive to it. 

I see psychiatry as a thing people use to -manage- problems. The problem with psychiatry here isn't that it addresses problems; it's that -management- is an essentially recuperative position that admits of no problems with society at large. The responsibility is (ironically) entirely on the ""patient"" to adapt themselves to better endure the emotional and social alienation that plagues modern society. A failure to appreciate that psychiatry is an extremely flawed attempt to address social and emotional dysphoria is a failure of imagination, and ambition. We want a revolution, after all.

Another fact is that psychiatry is practically (and if you get an honest psych, they'll admit this) a form of harm reduction, which in theory gives the afflicted ""patient"" enough life-stability to begin working on life skills and building relationships. What often happens, of course, is that psychiatrists and ""patients"" become co-dependent, and the temporary, vested authority in the doctor's expertise gives way to a permanent, asserted, authority which is backed up by the force of state government."
Anarchism,fp4qotm,t1_fozxvk6,1588305032.0,">  In matters of boots, refer to the bootmaker. In matters of mental health, I refer to the psychiatrist.

Please, don't. You couldn't have stumbled upon a better example of the difference between expertise and authoritarianism. Boots are products of labor and are not ethical subjects and cannot feel pain or be instrumentalized or alienated, and they do not have needs, such as the respect for their volition and autonomy. it is precisely that psychiatrists treat us like boots that indicates a problem.

Psychiatrists exist to manage people's behaviour so that the ""patient"" (notice: no longer a human agent, but rather the recipient of agency) can be a productive members in a capitalist economy.

For matters of mental health, we really need to build support networks that empower people with mental health challenges to make their own decisions and advocate for themselves. After all, what does it really mean to be called ""crazy"" in a world that's gone totally insane?

I went to Emotions Anonymous for a little over a year. I liked it a lot and i would still be going to those meetings except I found another group that I like better and I only have so many free days.

https://theicarusproject.net/

The Icarus project is at the crossroads of mental health and social justice, so it gives me something to work on and put energy into aside from the pure sharing/listening in a circle like E.A.. I like Icarus peer-group meetings because they are organizationally anarchist, meaning the meeting can take whatever form the participants need it to at the time. Most of the time there is a block of time for speaking/sharing/listening and then there is also time for open discussion. Cross-talk is permitted as long as you don't give unasked advice or try to solve people's problems.

What I like most about Icarus groups, though, is that they don't make me feel like a broken person or a bad person the way that authoritarian mental health systems do; rather, Icarus groups make me feel like I have comrades who share the same struggle I have of trying to adapt myself to a world despoiled by late-imperial capitalism.
