Waxpen,fqalh5k,t1_fqakozv,1589221082.0,It definitely does make one look like a hardcore drug user 😭 I've always thought and said this. I am interested in a new rig maybe something electrical that doesn't cost too much but everything seems to be over $300.
Waxpen,fqake6n,t1_fqajv6e,1589220558.0,Honestly these rigs definitely seem more advanced. I just have a regular glass dab rig with a quartz banger and a torch. I don't know much about what's better or if it just depends on how much you're willing to spend.

Spyro,fp1om8c,t3_gadku5,1588242778.0,Same just got it on sale for $20. It's a load of fun for everyone! Challenging but not impossible like Crash Bandicoot 😂 brings back the memories on PS1 although I'm much better at the game now than I originally remember. It's a good looking game can't go wrong with the animated action and playstyle as a dragon.
GearsOfWar,fozovkx,t3_gaf5f6,1588194289.0, Xbox VS Mode online  has a lot of people playing and I just got the game. Lots of modes all should have players game isn't too old .

introvert,fg5v8fs,t3_ewzu0c,1580540264.0,"Well, times on a screen are definitely remarkable and outstanding. Also portraying lack of social relationships in real life but still being 'conneced' online. We find comfort in the randomness and the use of anonymous profiles and feel like people don't know this place that we care so much about. It's a wonderful thing."
nostalgia,fg4x8cm,t1_fg3y018,1580513134.0,I feel like they need more machines there not much of a variety for my preferences.
