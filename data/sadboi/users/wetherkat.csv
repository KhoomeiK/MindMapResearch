I realize that MTC is not about sewing per se, so I understood that it was not going to show much sewing & was ok with that. However, I felt like MTC was kind of a “fast food” type of show when it should have been a “fine dining” type of show. By that I mean it seemed to be mostly flash and no substance. We saw designers sketching, but hardly anything of the design process itself. We saw packets being left for the seamstress “elves,” but didn’t see anything about what happened with them (WHY couldn’t some of the items be completed by the seamstresses? What was lacking? What was the issue? Which packets were “good” and how were they good?). We saw designers choose materials, but not much about what went into their decisions? Was cost a factor or not? We saw some handcrafted stuff but not the actual process (how were Esther’s cutouts made? How did Jonny weave his handwoven open material? Did he do it or did someone in Bali do it?). How were the kiosks designed? How much custom tailoring did Sander’s clothes require? What was the custom jewelry made of? Real gold? Real silver? Sterling silver? What were the bags made if? Plastic? Pleather? Leather? How were prices determined? How detailed were the business plans? How would an individual garment fit on 5 different body sizes (that should have been a challenge). If the show is about “marketable” why bother even showing the artsy or couture versions? Why did they need to see someone “evolve”? Was that just a code for “followed our instructions”? At the end of each show it was hard to even remember what happened because so little actually happened. Get some competent judges. Provide meaningful feedback. Give contestants equal time. End of rant."

My point is that being a single mom can be extremely difficult, but don’t assume that it is so much worse than being a married mom with an uninvolved husband (or worse).

I let mine sit idle for about 20 years and then took it in for a tune-up. Since it has metal parts (not plastic) the shop was able to restore it to excellent operating condition for the standard tune-up price of about $100. It continues to make a very beautiful stitch (actually several, since mine will do 3, 4, or 5-thread serging). Of course, mine had absolutely no rust, has all of the accessories, and has the original manual. So your mileage may vary. You need to check on the year purchased, accessories, manual, presence of rust, etc. & I would recommend requesting a video of it serging if possible (probably not possible since it was his mom’s but you really MUST have the manual). You might check eBay not to buy, but if you look at completed sales you can get an idea of the going rate. It might not be worth the hassle, since you can get a very basic but brand new Brother serger for a couple hundred dollars (no frills, but they seem to get good reviews)."

Everyone gets older. You may feel important and invincible just because you are young and healthy, but (best case scenario) you WILL age.

And when that happens I hope you do not live in a society that has decided that its  more vulnerable members are expendable.
Also—younger people are now getting sicker. This virus mutates. We don’t know what’s ahead.
We should make every effort to protect EVERYONE and to take the situation VERY seriously right NOW.

When I offered bottles of disinfectant I was told, “We’ve all already been exposed anyway so there’s no point.” When the schools closed they said, “It’s an overreaction, and kids out of school are going to spread it faster than kids in school would have.” It is beyond frustrating."

bahai,fkivbaz,t3_fippqw,1584229494.0,"Our Baha’i group used Zoom this morning for the first time and we are planning to use it again for the next Feast (& probably after that). It took a while to get audio for everyone, which we finally accomplished, and one couple could finally see everyone else, but we couldn’t ever see them (but since they could see everyone else and we could all hear them, we went ahead with the meeting). The person calling the meeting paid for a month, and then that let us all meet for more than two hours even though the rest of us only had basic accounts—so apparently only the person calling the meeting would need to have the premium version. (My app actually had a message at the top stating that the 40-minute restriction had been temporarily been lifted, but no one else saw that message for some reason.) It would be good idea to have a “test meeting” just to make sure everyone can get/produce both audio & video before you try to have an actual meeting. The couple who couldn’t get their camera working today is going to have a test meeting tomorrow to try to fix the camera problem so that we can hopefully see everyone on Feast night. Only one of the 7 people in our group had ever used Zoom before, and she is the one who sent out the meeting invitation and meeting password via email—but we all still had to install the app and sign in as well. It was a new experience for 6 of us but overall I think it went relatively well, and we are looking forward to using it for the next Feast."

breastcancer,fk9y7tm,t3_feqidh,1583986608.0,"Herceptin is a considered a “miracle drug” for a reason. HER2 positive cancer is extremely aggressive. I know that side effects can be absolutely brutal (I had SEVERE side effects from chemo but, strangely, not from Herceptin), but since you asked, please still do everything you can to complete your treatments. By the end of chemo my oncologist even had to write a standing order for me to get IV infusions w/ anti-nausea drugs every other day (even every day if needed) because the pills didn’t work and I developed a severe reaction to the patches. Maybe you need IV antihistamines or something (I’m not a doctor). Your oncologist SHOULD be able to help you get through this, one way or another, though. Best wishes.

Edit: I agree with the other post suggesting that slowing down the infusion rate might also help."

When I got it cut into a wash-and-wear short hairstyle I realized how curly it still was. It is now growing out again and at about 3 inches it is still quite curly. My chemo was about 5 years ago. At this point I am thinking it will probably always be curly. I don’t mind; I like it this way."

breastcancer,fjsyt7a,t3_fend93,1583601673.0,"Just a short comment here since I did not have reconstruction. I did have a bilateral mastectomy, however. I did not get my drains out for 10 days. I had been afraid that would hurt but it didn’t, and I felt a little better emotionally after that. However, even though I was OK with not getting reconstruction, and was relatively OK with losing both breasts, I still had a weird emotional reaction to being naked in the shower. Every time I would start to wash my chest area, I would involuntarily whimper. Seriously, I would hear this pathetic-sounding whimpering, and then realize that it was me. This went on for about a year. I avoided looking at my chest in the mirror for many months. I also cried every day for about seven months or so, although I think some of that was a reaction to chemo. No matter what happened, my first reaction was to start sobbing. I am not saying this to discourage you, though. I am saying it to let you know that eventually, somehow, it got better. Slowly but surely, I adjusted. What probably helped the most was getting to know the other cancer survivors in my breast cancer support group. They understood, and were SO helpful. I began to think of them as my “tribe.” So things really do improve; it just takes time. I wish you all the best in your healing journey."
Dermatology,fjpqk5v,t1_fjpnwdl,1583558313.0,"I am so sorry for him! I guess I would wonder if his chronic hives/rash could still be caused by an allergen or allergens that he is still being exposed to somehow—perhaps not all the time, but frequently enough to cause the chronic reaction. The first rash/ hives that I had cleared up about 8 hours after the ER treatment. The second rash/hives were not exactly the same in location/severity & in fact were much worse because the hives were also between my fingers and all over my scalp, and my feet and legs were almost completely covered in addition to the rest of my body. And that time the symptoms lasted a week rather than a day. I got rid of the new scented detergent and washed all of my bed linens in unscented laundry soap; I also threw away the anti-insomnia essential oil spray fragrance & re-washed my pajamas & clothes as well. I have not had an episode since then. Anyway, I hope that you are able to find specific answers to help your son. A diagnosis of “chronic idiopathic urticaria” for a child with chronic hives reminds me of the time I went to the doctor about weird lumps under the skin of my legs (calves) & was diagnosed with “subcutaneous nodules”—which basically just means lumps under the skin. I don’t understand how these are considered true diagnoses when they don’t lead to an understanding of what is actually going on. At any rate, good luck trying to get this figured out and I hope you find some specific answers soon."

Dermatology,fjnz1ud,t3_febgy2,1583517200.0,"I had exactly the same symptoms—the rash all over my body and the raised hives. I ended up in the ER where they gave me epinephrine (due to starting to have trouble breathing, & they said I could have died from anaphylactic shock if I hadn’t come in) and IV antihistamines. Even though it cleared up, it came back even worse 24 hours later & I ended up in the ER again, because they said it might recur in 24 hours & if so, to come back immediately. (Both of these sets of symptoms happened around 11 PM.) I was prescribed epi pens and 3 kinds of OTC antihistamines (they said to take all 3 at once). They also recommended a follow-up with an allergy doctor, but he only could test for certain things & those all came back negative. My best guess is that in my case it was an allergic reaction to either 1) a new highly perfumed laundry detergent that I had just started using or 2) an aromatherapy spray that was supposed to help insomnia that I had just started spraying on my pillows & sheets. At first they also thought it might have been the result of a Lone Star Tick bite because that causes an allergy to red meat, and I had eaten red meat for the first time in a month the night I broke out (I had found an engorged tick on my forehead at the hairline about a week or 10 days previously). However, they can test for that and it also came back negative. Bottom line is it is highly likely to be an allergic reaction, although it might be difficult to figure out the specific cause. Also, this could possibly lead to breathing problems/anaphylaxis, so it could be dangerous. The allergy could be to anything, so ask yourself about any new foods, detergents, soaps, perfumes, & even the possibility of a tick bite. I recommend checking with a doctor/allergist, & if you notice any trouble breathing, consider that to be an emergency. Good luck!"
cancer,fjnp6d6,t3_fe69of,1583511869.0,"When I was undergoing chemotherapy I had such severe side effects that my oncologist told me I was one of the three worst cases he had ever seen, and he even considered stopping chemo because I was in such bad shape. One day when I was lying in bed wondering how I could possibly take another breath because the pain was so bad,  I thought about how people will put their pets through chemo no matter how much the pet is suffering, because they don’t realize how much suffering they are causing and they want to keep the pet alive as long as possible. At that moment I decided that I would never put my pets through such suffering. I have two cats who are extremely important to me for a number of reasons that I won’t go into here. They are quite old now and they have a number of health issues that require daily medications and shots, but they are still active, eat well, and are extremely attentive and social. However, I have told my vet that if either of them is ever suffering (other than temporary suffering, such as after having a tooth pulled), I would opt for euthanasia over chemotherapy and/or over prolonging their life just for MY benefit because of what I experienced during chemo. She understood and said she had taken an oath regarding suffering and would let me know if that happened. We have had a couple of close calls, and I know that each day is a gift, but I also know that when the time comes I will have to do what is best for my very-loved and cherished little family members, not for me. I have had cancer, and I have friends and family members who have had or currently have cancer, and I also have had friends and family members who have died of cancer—and I am not offended by the OP’s post at all. I am very sorry that the OP is going through this. I understand the special bond that was created when this cat was born, and the attachment to and love for this particular pet. Even though I lost my much-loved spouse (of more than 40 years) three years ago and I feel gut-wrenching grief every single day, in my opinion that does not negate or “disqualify” the grief and loss currently being felt by the OP. Understanding devastating feelings of pain and loss CAN make us MORE compassionate to all others who are suffering, regardless of whether we think their loss “doesn’t measure up” to our own. I extend my deepest sympathy to the OP.

Also, I don’t think the bell is insensitive. When I heard it, all I could think was that someone had made it through all of their infusions, & that gave me hope that I could, too.

Even though I can’t speak to port installation as a separate procedure, I did want to comment that a port is a VERY good thing to have when getting chemo. It is great that she is getting one! When I was going for chemo I made sure to arrive at least a half hour early so that I could ask for numbing cream to be put on top of it. There needs to be a thick layer of the cream and it needs time to work. However, I never once felt the (rather large) chemo needle being inserted, and never had to worry about leakage from an IV destroying blood vessels or tissue. I don’t know why the numbing cream isn’t standard procedure, but I have never heard of a request for it being refused. I strongly recommend it."
