antidepressants,f77jkxr,t3_damvs5,1573459881.0,"saved my life. took me a 13 months of awful anxiety and depression and just straight frustration, anger, it even cost me some relationships. I couldn‚Äôt make decisions and that made things even worse!

long story short, i started on 10mg and now i‚Äôm on 20mg and leaving it at that (my psych said). I forgot how it feels to be normal. Deada*s i feel like myself again. what pushed me over the edge to finally start on Paxil was my doctor explaining how this medication works. I was so worried because i previously believed SSRI‚Äôs made u ‚Äúfake happy‚Äù... that‚Äôs not true. What this medication does is open more neurons (like doors) so that your ALREADY EXISTING serotonin has more pathways to go through and reach your brain. Before hand, my doc explained to me that my neurons are like doors. At the time, a lot of those doors had closed , now with Paxil those doors have been opened and is allowing me to feel what it feels to have a non panicked brain"
autismacceptance,f77ixpc,t1_f5y8mxd,1573458936.0,"Drama is such a good extracurricular for making friends. My best friend was in the drama. department. Hate to be one of ‚Äúthose‚Äù but we  were definitely more friends with the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù group of kids. Yet, the people she spent most of her time after school for hours on end with turned out to be some of the most exciting, loving, and yet the most diverse group of kids. Being apart of the drama club could really push them (ur sibling) to expand socially and be friends with all different types of kids at their school. It‚Äôs a good way to become more familiar with your school too, seeing familiar faces in the hall always helps. especially in high school"
autismacceptance,f77ii4u,t3_dr20zq,1573458332.0,"Heyo! I‚Äôm 20 years old and my brother is 19. My whole life my brother always did pretty bad in school, never tried, couldn‚Äôt focus ever. Turns out he had ADHD, Attention deficit hyperactive disorder. Maybe sometimes you act out more dramatically than most, or something bothers you and make you angrier faster. Honestly, growing up i would say about 3 out of every 5 students at my high school had some form of learning disability. It‚Äôs not a bad thing at all and if you get the right diagnosis you‚Äôll get accommodations in school that might give you longer period of time to complete tests or assignments. This stuff was super helpful for my brother and now he‚Äôs in college at Florida State and he‚Äôs doing awesome (grade-wise)! Good luck :) let me know if u find out. Everyone‚Äôs got a kink in their system! I was diagnosed with major social anxiety and then depression about a year ago- never in my life did i think i would, but hey i‚Äôm happy as a clam and i‚Äôm killing it in life! :)"
AmItheAsshole,f77gnw7,t3_dufzum,1573455826.0,"You are wrong. Disability or not, 10 years old and not being invited to a classmates birthday party when everyone else is is honestly terrifying for kids that age. Imagine a young kid in your sons class throwing a birthday party and specifically only leaving YOUR son out. He would be embarrassed. Now imagine David who most likely reacts to situations with heightened emotions (like x6282). Something small like not being included in a peers birthday party shows him that he can‚Äôt have friends that aren‚Äôt on the spectrum, or that he will have issues making friends with kids his age. You‚Äôre teaching david that he is not welcomed amongst his class. If david was my son i would have done a lot worse than make a post."
