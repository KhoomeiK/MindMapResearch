Guns are dangerous yes, I will agree that a lot of bad people have guns, but so do a lot of decent people who use it for hunting or for self defense and a feeling of protection. I think it would be punishing the many for the actions of the few to take away guns when plenty people use it responsibly. Also people can be at danger without someone attacking them with a gun, say someone tries to get them with a knife in your home late at night, if you own a gun you can be safe and there's a drastically lower chance of you being harmed.

Some people belive in creationism yes, but its not taught in school anymore, and almost no one is pushing for it. Even extremely religious people are demanding creationism be taught in schools. The vast majority are against it being taught.

The reason there is a two party system is because that's who people chose to vote for, and the reason democrats and Republicans are televised is because no one wants to watch other parties talk. Most countries have a similar system where only 2 parties get attention or voted for. As a libertarian I wish people would consider voting third party but people who even side with a third party will still vote for one of the two parties because they view a third party vote as wasted. Its a mindset most people fall into in representative democracies where there are political parties.
In Canada as well I'm guessing there are more than those three parties and those other ones don't get attention or votes either, which is still almost as flawed as two parties demanding the votes."
