As for Myst 3 and 4 those weren't developed by Cyan which complicates matters, not to mention that 3, 4 and 5 all run on different proprietary engines and are more complicated than the earlier games so it would take a lot more work to port them anyway.

Setting up the Apple encoder is a bit of a pain. You'll need to go [here](https://sites.google.com/site/qaacpage/cabinet), download qaac_2.68.zip as well as makeportable.zip. You'll also need to download the iTunes installer from Apple's website. (no need to actually install it though) And you'll need to install [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) if you don't already have it. Make sure the iTunes installer is in the same folder as makeportable.bat and it will extract all the necessary files for you. Copy all the x64 iTunes files to the folder qaac64.exe is in. Then when you select the Apple AAC encoder in foobar2000 it will ask you where qaac64.exe is located.

It's worth the trouble. Apple's AAC encoder is the best one.

If you want to avoid all that though see if your playback device supports Ogg Vorbis or better yet Opus. Both of those are superior to any AAC encoder and easier to set up. For Vorbis 128 to 192 kbps is fine with the sweet spot being 160 and with Opus you can go from 80 to 128 kbps with the sweet spot being 96."
