ADHD,fbh1u5m,t3_ed9d4k,1576863625.0,"fuck this post just hit home. just failed a semester of college too. never felt like this depressed because of my inability to be productive and motivated about every aspect of my life. i also stopped getting medicated cuz i could afford the cost on top of everything else i’m i have to afford like rent and groceries. i honestly am so impressed that people can be unmedicated their whole life and cope with it, i can’t even get through some school assignments with becoming completely distressed. hope u can find a way to go to therapy and everything gets back on track for you :)"

Also, this dosage aren’t doing shit for me focus wise just a couple symptoms if that helps. Both have given me that symptom tho and hell of anxiety.  I’ll try magnesium tho thanks for the tip."
adhd_anxiety,f8bf09e,t1_f8b7yen,1574435286.0,Omg I tho I was the only one that experimented the stiff jaw symptom. It literally feels like my mouth is glued together and my tongue is stuck to the roof of my mouth. It’s so uncomfortable I hate that feeling man

depression,f6u2tac,t1_f6sxs5d,1573157371.0,High school was barely bearable but college is just dreadful.
depression,f6t4v5s,t1_f6rpv0k,1573144034.0,Yup we kinda have a way of become dependent on depression to be there.
depression,f6rgalq,t1_f6rfsek,1573102999.0,"I’m not taking out my angry, I’m just let you know how your comments and comments from there like that can have negative impact on people that suffer from depression. Maybe I cursed a couple times but that’s not angry that’s just me. You may not be hurting anyone physically but when someone opens up dismissing them like that can lead to a negative spiral deeper into a depressive episode. And I can say that what could possible happen from experience.  Maybe you don’t currently have the desire to commit sucked but if you ever got to the point where you though about it, decided to open up to somewhere like the internet and someone says “ be grateful your problems don’t exist plus your privileged” I think you would be angry too. Also, as someone who has tried to commit sucide and battle depression for a long time I couldn’t just read something like that and keep scrolling. WORDS MTHERFCKING HURT"
depression,f6rebcf,t3_dsr639,1573101139.0,"u/fivepoundsquash please disregard everything above, your feelings are valid af no matter your relationship status. What motivates me to get through the days is the though that may on the next day something positive in my life will happen that will lead to more positive things happening and so forth. This maybe lame, but the thought does help to slightly make everything more bearable. I hope this depression wave pass quickly for you :)"
depression,f6rdu9e,t1_f6r90sv,1573100720.0,"Just because someone is in a relationship or privilege doesn’t dismiss their depression or life experiences in any way.  Privilege and mental disorders are very much related, but in this context you have no fucking idea of the situation or their life to say some outlandish shit like that.  Also, someone can be privilege in one area, but completely disadvantages in another area. They said they have ptsd, and you had the audacity to write this with considering what possible could have happened to them that lead to that disorder. What type of bullshit is that to say, “be thankful” how do you know he/she/them isn’t grateful that someone wants to be in their lives. Depression has a crazy way of snatching away your motivation and will to be an active member in your life even if you want to. I don’t know what you have faced or what genetics issue you are referring to, but to disregard and minimize his experiences like that is really fucked up.  As a single, lonely ass person myself don’t take your loneliest out on others, that’s a terrible coping mechanism."
depression,f6rcxee,t3_dsp3op,1573099927.0,"Death is an option, you can’t really know for certainty hat it’s the answer. Hypothetically, (First: I in no way known ur life and what you have been faced with) obstacles and predicaments in ur life could start to ease. Possible even relationships and friendship can start up, which real positive connections with people in general making living through this bullshit world a lot more digestible. That’s what’s keeping me from trying to off myself for the third time, the possibility that it’ll become what I imagine life to be like when I was younger. Also, the though that my pain can just be passed to the next created this dilemma between self interest and worldly cost that keeps me from trying again. I hope this didn’t sound corny to you, because if anything I don’t want to sound like the fake optimistic people saying “it’ll get better buddy.” I just want you to know that I hear you and wanted to reach out with what helps me break the negative, self-depreciating thought loops that always lead to suicidal ideation."
depression,f6rbu2v,t1_f6qtx4u,1573099030.0,"Sheesh same you would think that it would be easy but it’s surprisingly isn’t. And that doesn’t even start on the outward effects it could have on others maybe even leading them down the same path.  Hope ur suffering eases fam, so that doesn’t have to be an option for you. Also, lmao at ur username love it."
depression,f6rbim4,t3_dsqt1v,1573098771.0,"I remember reading somewhere a quote that said something like depression starts to feel like home. For me it’s become a constant something I can relay on when everything else is adapting. 
While, physical pain brings reason to your suffering at least that’s the reason I self harm. To act as a form of punishment for not being the person I quietly wish myself to be and to have a real, tangible cause for my pain not just my internal turmoil. There really is a comfort in that hallow empty internal feeling depression causes and i can’t even imagine a life where it was gone."
depression,f6r9x9m,t3_dsm7fz,1573097519.0,“Day by day I’m dying.” Fuck thats heavy. Maybe not physically but mentally I’m deteriorating. Kinda wish it was physical then I would have a reason to be in pain.
SuicideWatch,f6r7s6o,t3_dspqb6,1573095892.0," I’m envious, I wish I could give up on this bullshit again. Sadly I don’t have any saving to fall back on, can’t risk being homeless. But, because I went down hill so fast my siblings started checking on me now. It was nice tho , nothing but the comfort of your bed and escape from the trash world outside. Honestly it felt like being a kid again. Only difference was my depressive, self hating thoughts were very much still present. Letting me know how worthless I was being for lying there all day, crazy how I the cycle of doing nothing continues even when those thoughts trash talk you for being a lazy piece of shit."
SuicideWatch,f6r6exg,t3_dspqb6,1573094881.0,"Literally laid in bed for like three month straight in the beginning of the year. Spend my days watch my fav childhood movies on repeat. Reminiscing about the when I use to be content. Complete said fuck college, barely slept, and lost a shit ton of weight. But, still not gonna lie possible the highlight of the best couple years it was nice af. I hope i die just laying in bed asleep, that would be fucking amazing."
depression,f6r3xji,t3_dlfw2v,1573093085.0,"Yeah I kinda fought with myself for a while over if I should go or not. Backed out last minute because I’m a punk. I honestly regret it I could of learned some things bout coping, maybe even made some friends. But in the end my anxiety about who was gonna be there and what type of questions were they gonna be asking got to me. Also, yeah that why I love it on this subreddit i get to engage with people that are experiencing similar struggles with the anxiety of physically encountering them."
depression,f67d41j,t1_f4t0ci4,1572718567.0,"Fucking same. I tried to explain to my therapist how hard I try to be content with my life. How I try to place myself in social situations and interact with people, but just end up feeling like I’m forcing happiness. I literally can’t even recall the last time I felt fulfillment/passion in any aspect of who I am or what I want for myself.  I tried to explain how my sadness is the only thing that brings me comfortable because of the familiarity of it. She decided that I should sign up for a two day depression group session. When all I wanted was for her to hear me, to say she understands how I’ve been feeling. Tbh I don’t even know why I decided to go in the first place."
lonely,f63g9b3,t3_dqg4ht,1572676826.0,"Cant even describe how this hit home. Currently trying to transfer colleges because the severity of my loneliness and depression of hit a new max.  I’ve given up on trying to vent about my depression to my friends after comments like I’m making them feel depressed. Lol that’s how I feel 24/7, so I’ve kinda become numb to the feeling . Crazy to heard someone say the dream about scenarios were their happy, I though I was insane for doing that. Exactly why I love movies so much, I can escape into the plot and become a different person for an 1 or 2."
