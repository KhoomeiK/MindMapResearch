Iowa,fp87ak5,t3_gbs2iy,1588385327.0,I feel you.  I have social anxiety and I go out to nature to be alone and enjoy it.  Lately there have been an over abundance of people at the parks and it makes me so anxious I can’t even go.  I have to find those little unknown parks out in the country now if I want to enjoy some peace.

Iowa,fohto65,t1_fohtagr,1587772437.0,Yeah.  I feel you.  I’m worried about that too.  Especially with how many people applying for unemployment right now (and are approved) aren’t even receiving it.  I’m glad I applied on March 17th right after they closed us.  I feel so bad for everyone who is having to wait because they are so backed up.
Iowa,fohtdii,t3_g7e0c1,1587772271.0,I’d rather be safe and stay home until cases drop dramatically.
Iowa,foht2qu,t3_g7j9lj,1587772107.0,I asked this question when I applied for unemployment.  I work at a fine dining restaurant downtown in Des Moines.  The unemployment worker told me that I should keep filing for unemployment even when we do get our jobs back.  He told me that we don’t know what will happen with everything going on and that they could choose to shut us down again.  So he said it was better to just stay on it.  He said when they see that you are making so much or your regular wages again that they will cut you off unemployment.

I’m so sorry for your gf though.  I feel so sad for her.  I hope she will be able to recover quickly with all of these helpful tips and tricks.  If I were a bell millionaire I’d offer to give her bells, but alas I’m not.  But I offer my most heartfelt sympathies for her."

I only have the Sakura wood floor to get and then I’ll be back to selling stuff to pay off my upstairs.  Also, idk if this would help, but I just choose not to catch any of the medium sized fish right now.  Those are the ones that can come out to be eggs.  I only go for the small ones or the big ones."
Serverlife,fmvzdq6,t3_fxknhs,1586435725.0,I’m gonna say we will still be closed.  I think they’re going to try to be as cautious about bringing us back as possible.  I’d think maybe the beginning of June is when some of us might be coming back.
Iowa,fmmeq1v,t1_fmlrbu9,1586203931.0,"I agree.  My husband and I go out to the parks and walk the trails on the nicer days.  The vast majority of people that are out there are doing great with social distancing.  Though yesterday I did see a big family gathering by the lake for what looked like a birthday, which had me miffed.  But that’s the only instance I’ve actually seen of anyone in the parks disrespecting the social distancing rule.  And I live in Ames where there’s a fair amount of people. So I feel like that’s saying something."

Iowa,fmcrt4a,t3_fud4ud,1585951556.0,90% of the places that are still open are considered essential workplaces.  It wouldn’t change much.
Iowa,fmcrc1e,t3_fuf4v5,1585951277.0,Yes.  IDPH would be the ones we need to get to change their minds on anything if we want Kim to do anything.  I personally feel like people should be going after them over the SIP order.  She did state very bold and clear that she’s doing what they recommend.

COVID19_support,fm99osp,t3_ftnmvs,1585864391.0,You could go outside and go for a walk.  It always helps me to get out into nature and have that moment away from this new reality.  I like to go off the trails and wander into the woods to really get away from people.  But I also enjoy foraging for mushrooms and other wild foods out there too.  But there’s something about the peace of being out there and listening to the birds sing and the river run that just helps me realize everything will be alright in the end.  Also it’s super easy to social distance out there.
desmoines,fm98dbe,t1_fm91sy4,1585863665.0,Exactly!  People are just bored and getting stir crazy.  Everyone just wants to complain and whine about something because they have nothing better to do right now.  It makes me sad for them.

Iowa,fm5dbfo,t3_ft6b51,1585770795.0,"People need to realize that the Iowa Department of Health is the one not recommending there be a stay at home order.  As long as they don’t feel there’s a need, Kim isn’t going to issue it.  Also, the states that do have shelter in place really are dealing with the same things we are now.  People aren’t listening and staying in even with shelter in place.  We would just have the name, but people will still do the same thing they’re doing now.  And everyone will still be upset.  Half of my family lives in Illinois and their state is locked down.  And still people are going out and gathering.  Somehow we’ve got to reach the younger people and the few older ones who aren’t taking this seriously."
Iowa,fm1thbn,t3_fshgvy,1585684716.0,I can’t believe people think SIP is going to make a difference in how people are acting.  People are still going to go out and not listen.  The majority that aren’t taking this seriously are college kids and teenagers who think they’re invincible.  And they’d be the ones to still go out despite SIP.

I think she’s doing great.  She’s not just acting on a whim.  She’s talking with everyone from health officials to the president to determine the best actions to take.  She’s taking into account all of the different metrics of the situation.  I totally understand that she doesn’t want to jump the gun and close us down for 30 days.  She doesn’t want any businesses to have to be closed longer than needed.  You guys need to understand this isn’t ALL just her doing.  Her and her council talk every day and collectively determine what’s best for Iowa.  So please stop just pointing fingers at Kim.  She’s not in this alone.  We need to be more understanding and think about what it would be like to have to be in that position.  It would be so hard to know that you’re holding the well being of all Iowans in your hands.  Over 3,000,000 of us, that’s a lot of pressure."

Anxiety,fllh8zj,t1_fllc3kx,1585260293.0,"I’m not a doctor but it very well could be anxiety.  My chest has been tight on and off for almost a week now.

I read about a symptom of about 48% of people are having is gastrointestinal stuff and then yesterday my stomach was upset.  I’m totally fine today and I fully believe I had worked myself up so much that it was my anxiety that caused it.  The mind is such a powerful thing.  I hope I was able to help."

COVID19positive,fliit7h,t3_fp0p99,1585183439.0,"I’ve been having similar symptoms.  Tightness in chest, GI distress that started last night and has carried on to today, my throat has felt very mildly sore for the past 5 days.  But no main symptoms like fever, no dry persistent cough, and no shortness of breath.  I’m attributing it all to anxiety right now unless I get one of the 3 symptoms I mentioned.  Anxiety can do a number on your GI and cause muscles in the chest area to feel tight and restricted.  But, it could just be a very mild case of COVID for all I know.  Either way, we should just stay inside and self quarantine.  It’s a stressful time but we will make it through."
Anxiety,flh6pty,t1_flh5zlp,1585157099.0,I have totally been to that point!  It was back in 2011 for me when I went through that.  Thinking I had something wrong with my heart.  I went out and bought a heart rate/oximeter to check my heart rate and even bought something to check my blood pressure.  I was afraid to even leave the house because my anxiety was so bad.  I thought I was going to drop dead any minute.  Intrusive thoughts were really bad back then too!  And those scared me a lot.  Like I thought something was going to take over and make me act on them.  But I have made it through and have never gone through a rough patch as bad as that again.  I obviously still have anxiety and symptoms from time to time.  I’ve since also been to therapy which helped me get a handle on things a lot.  You definitely aren’t alone.  You’ll get through this.  I know it.  And you’ll be able to help and encourage others with your testimony in the future.  Be well friend!

Anxiety,flfnf2f,t1_flflwyp,1585111419.0,"Well, I go through the main symptom checklist of covid.  Do I have a fever?  Do I have a dry cough?  Am I struggling to breath?  When all of those check out no, I feel a bit more calm.  I’ve been playing relaxing video games to help calm me down like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley.  Reading helps also, I usually get so relaxed while reading that I fall asleep.  Taking a hot bath is another thing that helps me relax.  I saw on a post somewhere on a sub yesterday about the Oximeter app for Apple which checks your blood oxygen and heart rate.  So if I get on the verge of a breakdown I’ll use that to assure myself I’m fine.  I don’t blame you for not wanting to get addicted to those.  That’s one of the reasons I refuse to take medication.  Going to therapy helped me a lot.  I also try to remind myself that I’m 32 and healthy with no underlying issues, so if I did get it I would probably have a mild case.  If you are religious, I find praying helps as well.  I hope I was able to help or give you some ideas.  We will make it through this.  We just have to keep leaning on one another for support.  It’s always nice to know someone is listening and cares."
Anxiety,flfew3a,t1_flfegdn,1585104822.0,Thank you so much for the kind words.  If I develop anything like a fever and dry cough I’ll definitely be going to the doctor.  Your words are very encouraging.  I hope you start to feel better also.  We will indeed get through this.

No.  Am I actually having difficulty breathing?  No.  Am I having body aches and chills?  No.  Do I feel fatigued all the time?  No.  It helps me realize it is just anxiety and that I’m fine and gives me peace of mind in the end.  This is just my method, I know it might not help everyone, but it gives me peace of mind in the moment."
