EatingDisorders,fmqtz1v,t3_fwjsov,1586307008.0,"Well, that's exactly how I think. Perhaps the difference is that I don't *think* that I'm the reason behind that ED, in fact, I'm *certain*. I had an ED just when I heard about them, I committed to try, and then that was how I got into this.
Though, I don't feel guilty, because I never wanted to hurt myself, if I ever did anything, then I always wanted the best for myself. If I ever mistook the way, then at least, I know I tried and wanted the best. Thus, I'll learn something from the mistake and I'd rush to find another way to get through. I don't even regret what I've done. The reason? Because to me at that time, it was the best choice I could make - according to my knowledge and inexperience at that time -  and I wanted to see what will happen. I learned stuff I wouldn't to learn if I didn't have this experience ( ED). Most important, is when I realized what hell I'm going through, I had to stop ASAP, because stopping when I realized the mistake was the wisest and best decision (because a mistake without a lesson is just destruction).           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
I also would want to add, that if I learned from others' mistakes before my ED develop, it was going to be more wise than committing to try it myself. The things I learned from my ED I could have learned somewhere else. (I'm saying this because it's fool to do a mistake with the excuse of wanting to learn.) Though, since I've already made the mistake, regret is useless, it will only hold me back. That's why I don't regret it."
getdisciplined,flpg9xw,t1_flpe74q,1585358784.0,"We tend to stick with what we believe about ourselves, so if you believe that when things get hard you're likely to quit, then you will most probably do that.
Just no matter whatever, have a sense of pride. The pride of not letting someone mesmerize you. The pride of not letting yourself to be weak. Don't have fragile endurance. What about your glory? your dignity? Be careful, make balance between your self-honor and respect, while avoiding being selfish and arrogant, there's a very fine line between them. Also that doesn't mean the other person is necessarily bad, but don't be dependable on anybody no matter who they're. Being independent and strong is gonna be the best gift you'll ever have."

And here, I ain't attacking as I mentioned, not asking anyone to defend and justify why they like what they like. But questioning things we do makes us better understand ourselves and motives. Especially in order not to spend our times doing stuff and then after a long way we regret what we've done. At least to live with a vision, knowing why we do what we do. Not just to react to whatever popped up in our way, and blindly follow any herd.
That's it."

This is for those who procrastinate tasks they know the right time for them is now + no serious point of putting that task off. Though, for every rule there's an exception, and the exception here is for those tasks that we know that putting off will be more rewarding than doing them, and that perhaps because there are other tasks that are much more important at that specific time.
And the interpretation that ""you have to do all outstanding tasks right now"" is totally wrong. That's a dull way of acting even."

I guess the only convincing reasoning is that awards or paying for a membership support Reddit to continue on internet. That's it.
