physiotherapy,f8n1ijm,t1_f8m9iyq,1574637921.0,"wow thank you for such a detailed answer.
I did read up on stroke rehabilitation too and found that physios have patients do a lot of repititive movement, to remember movements they used to do on a daily basis. is this true"

nursing,f2des8r,t3_dcu37z,1570152321.0,"im a student nurse and at my uni, I see a lot of people who got in from doing an access to nursing course. 

I'm not sure if you have AP results, but the uni should be able to use it in place of GCSE.  or you could do GCSE on the side while doing access to nursing.

an alternative route would be to start a foundation year, which would get you into nursing after completion.

Google ""UCAS search courses"" and search for Nursing. look at the entry requirements and see which one you prefer"

depression,f284jgu,t3_dcf8yj,1570052553.0,"uncomfortable situations is what makes us grow.

it's not about feeling confident going into the situation, it's not about knowing that it's going to work out. it's about doing it. a lot of people go into interviews with self doubt in mind but doubt gets out of the way when you express courage.

even if you didn't pass this interview, the most important thing is that you did it. you put yourself in an uncomfortable situation, and you can do it again.

reflect on your interview, find out what you may have done wrong and take notes. then rectify them for your next interview.

practice some deep breathing techniques before your interview next time. meditate the night before. and walk in there with confidence even though you have to fake it sometimes. 

good luck"
depression,f283zk2,t3_dcfalu,1570052196.0,"I'm in the exact same boat, and I have been for a few years now lol.

me and my friend were extremely broke together, no girlfriends nothing.

he recently got a 50k job, while me, I'm stuck at university, failed my second year. 

He found a girlfriend, while I'm stuck here alone.

but if he can do it then so can I.

it should give us hope that our friends were in the same position as us and they got out of it, what's stopping us from climbing out of the hole too?"
depression,f282c9k,t3_dcgfm9,1570051150.0,"I was in a similar situation. 

I joined a boxing club, made a lot of friends there. started hanging out with them.

then I started Cuban salsa, and made even more friends.

you just gotta know where to look. if I were you I would join social clubs like these too."

depression,f280jnf,t3_dcb40b,1570050014.0,"I was in a similar situation to this. I was told to think with your brain, not your heart. Because feelings come and go.

You've experienced what it takes to get in a relationship with someone. and you've experienced what it takes to fall in love. So what's stopping you from feeling those emotions again?

if a millionaire was left in a foreign country with no money, most likely he'll make that million again because he's experienced what it takes to become a millionaire."
depression,f25efee,t1_f2507is,1569972468.0,"you're lucky then lol I even considered moving to Germany to study there as an international student. 
I guess one thing you don't have to worry about is wasting money if you decide to change your mind when doing your course. 

If you really are worried about not finding employment after your course then look at vocational courses, such as nursing. you complete the degree and can get straight into nursing. employment is pretty much guaranteed. not sure how it is in Germany but you can always find work as a nurse in the UK."
depression,f24y2d8,t1_f24vtdv,1569962385.0,here in the UK we have something called maths GCSE which is a crucial requirement to get into university. It took me 4 attempts to finally pass it lol.
depression,f24u0un,t1_f24s1fx,1569960319.0,"I'm also bad at maths lol. it took me 4 attempts to finally pass. 

I would look at engineering branches that require the least amount of maths. for example, chemical engineering. 

I'm not sure if they do apprenticeships in your country. if so, then look at them.

would you consider moving to the UK or USA to study and create a new life there? as there are always more opportunities in those types of countries."

I loved what I was learning, I have a passion for sports and learning about the anatomy and physiology of the human body, and I loved working with athletes. I dropped out as I realised that it doesn't have many career prospects. I then went on to do nursing, but I failed it in my second year. I'm now 23 years old, completely lost in life, extremely depressed seeing my friends and family have their life sorted out, when I'm here wasted so much time and money. 

I'm in a similar position to you. completely lost and no idea what to do.

I guess if you just want to make a lot of money I wouldn't go to university. I would do an apprenticeship as an electrician, and become a contractor. they make a killing"

depression,f24811b,t3_dbvhmm,1569946575.0,"I was in this situation too. I had really bad social anxiety. You have to start putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, that's really what makes us grow. When you subject yourself to activities that require struggle and challenges, you experience all that is needed for personal growth.

I started boxing to put myself in an uncomfortable situation. My confidence grew and grew it was unbelievable. I then started competing and won my first fight which taught me self belief.

I then started clubbing, and that was way too uncomfortable for me. I didn't know how to dance. So I started learning Cuban salsa, found my rhythm and from there the social anxiety went away."
