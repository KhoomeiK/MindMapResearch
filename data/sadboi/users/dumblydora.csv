THIS. I couldn't have put it better myself. 

Thank you! Yes I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate this sub and everyone on here, I don't feel like I'm the only one going absolutely crazy with my thoughts. (I wish none of us were but atleast we're not alone and somebody understands)"

BPD,f2b1o92,t3_dcjs4w,1570120613.0,"Oh god I do this so much. I joined reddit to send them memes and the like to keep conversations going. I think what helps me (SOMETIMES) is if I save what I send them instead of sending it right away, a sort of delayed gratification. Also, thankfully I have stopped blatantly asking for attention (I used to do that with my previous FP/SO a LOT and it didn't make me feel very good about myself)."

oddlysatisfying,f1znxjb,t1_f1zmmnp,1569846582.0,I mean employ basic decency. Most people who live in hotels live much more extravagantly (read: irresponsibly) than they would at home. Lay down a towel if you're going to be having sex and can't help but jizz all over the sheets.  Don't be callous enough to drop wine over it. Basically do nothing you wouldn't do at your own home. Most of the laundry here wouldn't even be that dirty but it was deemed ok to be sent for laundry because that's how we function when the work is neither done nor seen by us.
BPD,f1yjioy,t3_db5quw,1569817574.0,"Honestly, same. I don't feel as strongly about being a mother, but having the option essentially taken away from me by way of my BPD is frustrating af. It helped a little when I told myself that I could still be a mom to a puppy/kitten when I grow up."
oddlysatisfying,f1yhlce,t3_db2mmq,1569816463.0,The amount of water it would take to wash these. Wish people staying in hotels cared a little more about the environment and a little less about fresh white sheets smh

BPD,ey2zg98,t3_cv09q0,1566751735.0,Honestly I used to think my mom's had BPD too for a really long time but our motivations really seemed to differ. Only recently did I realise that it might be NPD instead. I'm not sure and I'm not here to make uneducated diagnoses but I understand where you're coming from. Her volatile behaviour shaped how I respond to a lot of situations and also maybe was the root of some of my triggers?
BPD,ey2z248,t3_cv7fhx,1566751466.0,"I was at the same place with a guy for the past couple of weeks. It all came crashing down today and it resulted in me using drugs again.

BPD,ey2ygu9,t3_cv7xbo,1566751066.0,"I used to be able to remember the tiniest of details that happened years ago like it was yesterday but as I hit my late teens, probably because I started dissociating a lot more, I started to lose that ability.

BPD,exf07lo,t3_csarmk,1566229617.0,"I actually feel the opposite? The more I'm pulling away from someone, the more I project my feelings onto them and accuse them of all sorts of things. When I'm secure, I do it. But I do it much much less."
BPD,exdtkf5,t1_excnu2k,1566186300.0,"I think the fact that I forget is a testament to my not obsessing over my disorder. The post is more accurately about the rude shock you get when you have been doing well for a while and realise that maybe your subconscious behaviour was not as well adjusted as you thought, and you are reminded of your bpd."

CFA,euom9xu,t3_cgutab,1563943703.0,Find out as much as you can about career progression out of ops and into the field you're interested in. As someone who was in financial ops myself the work is tedious and after 2 years or so there is an overwhelming desire to shift but the big companies rarely let you break out of the operations space.
