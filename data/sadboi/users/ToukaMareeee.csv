At first, when I heard she died, I felt bad because I hadn't seen her in a while. So she appeared in a dream, gave me hugs and kisses before she left, and everything was fine after that. 

Second, after the snuggling. My mother looked through the window at the church their coffin was put, waiting for the funeral(It was opposite of our house) and said something like ""haha grandma, we're still neighbors now. But don't go spook around!"" there had been no wind at all the whole day, but not even two minutes after she said that there was a huge wind blowing and howling against our windows. It was strange until such a endless day, and when asking others about it, only us and my grandparents who lived close to us noticed it.

At the funeral itself it wasn't a lot, it was small as almost a her relatives had already die, she was about 94. But there were some small things like it exactly being her favorite weather and her favorite birds(who are not found a lot in my country) in every tree you could see. It was beautiful. After that, we all went to my grandmothers house, eat some cake, and have fun. We knew she liked to eat cake so why wouldn't we as well. So we ate some cake, drank some wine and have fun. Until there was a little breeze which gave us all goosebumps, and we all knew, this was it, she's gone now.

But as long as you try your best to call them by their real name and right pronouns it's okay to slip sometimes. If you just correct I don't have any problems with it, personally you don't even have to apologize every time because(I'm non binary) I know it's just getting used to it, and my language doesn't really have an official gender neutral set of pronouns so that doesn't help either. But if you're like ""oh no I'm sorry I called you she I really am oh my God I'm really trying to work on it I am so sorry, are you okay? Damn I'm so sorry"" but then keeping to do it over and over again it's a big no from me"
AskReddit,fit7z3j,t3_f9g0zz,1582708705.0,"So I worked in a restaurant as the dishwasher for a year and sometimes helped in the kitchen. So I was quickly cutting some baguettes and when you are working with knives your gonna cut yourself on accident someday. Have had that way too often. That day I accidentally cut in the top of my thumb against. so I was like fuck not again, took some simple bandages and cleaned it in the sink as there was quite some blood flowing. It was only when the water cleaned my thumb from the blood I saw I cut really deep and the fingertip was totally loose from the rest of my thumb. I started to feel dizzy and almost fainted. Luckily the manager walked and and said I should go to the doctor to either get it removed or stitched. But the cook literally said, ""it's just a little cut"" while you could pick up my fingertip and move it freely from my thumb. + working with food and used cutlery and shit can cause infections for me with such a wound on my fingers and it is not healthy for the customers, as the blood didn't stop flowing soon

When I was home we cleaned it, and luckily it was just high enough  not to hit a bone so it could grow back. I didn't get stitches but probably if it was somewhat deeper it should have been removed. Still don't get why the cook wanted me to go on though."
Anxiety,fit6rvo,t3_f9n852,1582707061.0,"Yeah it happen to me as well. I have hsd it from when I was like 5. My parents would coincidentally start a conversation about what I was thinking about. So I always thought that when you grow up you ca. Read children's thoughts. It made me really scared of thinking when I was so young. I'm now not really scared any more but there's always something in the back of my mind that days ""what if they can read your mind and hear what you think"""
AskReddit,fit6kd2,t3_f9kd1v,1582706777.0,"Okay so, I have been hallucinating for like 6 years. It's almost gone now, but in the beginning when it was dark I saw all sort of creatures that actually weren't there. It always gave me the feeling they could kill me any moment. So a few weeks ago I was laying in bed at night and heard my brother screaming for something to be gone and our parents to help him. I instantly got the feeling it was such of those creatures so I thought like ""no don't take him"" and so it did. Immediately my whole body felt heavy and I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe as well so I really thought that was how it was gonna end.

A few days later when I fully recovered from the panic I realized that the part of my brother yelling was all just a dream and I instinctively woke up. But my body hadn't start up yet so that's why I couldn't move and was barely able to breathe. I'm doing fine now, I haven't had any dreams or hallucinations since that moment. And hopefully it stays away"
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fiqcnsw,t3_f99koa,1582641236.0,"As a nonbinary person I agree. If people talk about people who don't identify as their assigned gender st birth in general, I'd personally rather have people just say trans. If it's always ""trans and nonbinary"" it feels like I'm totally different then the rest. I know there's a difference but we all don't identify as our agab. And it makes me feel like I'm not ""trans"" enough to get some help, neither from friends or professionals.

I do know people feel differently about it, this is just my own personal view on it. I'm not saying every nb person feels like this, and everyone should identify as what they personally prefer"

AskReddit,fims8tc,t3_f8is6a,1582544988.0,"So once at school I was a bit pissed because the hallways were so crowded so I bumped my way through there. I was born a female but have always dressed a bit androgynous/masculine. So there was this freshman who yelled at his friend ""HAHA YOU JUST GOT HIT BY A TRANSEXUAL"" and after that moment I realized I indeed may not be female"
