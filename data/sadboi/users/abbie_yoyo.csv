They're saying a thing that's wrong. And you know in your heart they're wrong, and if they would be at all open, they'd see they're wrong. But being closed doesn't make them even a little bit right. They're still wrong. Like the people who believe the earth is flat, except this time it happens to be you that they're 100% wrong about.

But why take that on your shoulders? Why is their wrongness at all your problem? Why not just shrug at their misfortune for committing to ignorance and then completely dismiss them? Honestly, why?

It's not just your situation, this is something I've kind of been perplexed over for a minute now. Because it's absolutely everywhere. It's the basis of like 90% of political memes. Just people being wrong about a thing. And I do understand that in extreme cases somebody else's wrongness can affect the rest of us directly. The dickwads with guns in the fucking capital demanding they get to put everyone in danger if they want to is a perfect example. The civil war was a just war, fought over wrongness. But let's be real here; those instances are a minority. Most of the time, like in you circumstance, it really seems that we could just like, not care about what that person is saying and walk away. I mean, doesn't it?

I'm really asking here. This has been on my mind for a while now. And again, OP, I'm not saying your frustration is invalid or anything like that. I'm just saying, like, if they were to say hey OP, your favorite color is green, but in actuality, your favorite color was magenta, well, would that bother you? Or would you be more like slightly perplexed as to why they think they know your mind better than you do, but otherwise completely unaffected? And if it's the ladder, then how come political and social ideas are so frequently different from that? I know the stakes are much higher, but in the end the principle is the same, right? Somebody thinks a thing that is wrong. It's as common as hay fever, and often no more serious. But we all seem to get so distracted by it."

conspiracy,foniu7k,t3_g8eldz,1587920326.0,"""Fear-driven psychic defences"" is by far the snottiest way of describing a desire to live that I've seen so far.

 I'm not debating that the media has a vested interest in keeping the general population afraid, but this overly-verbose implication that avoiding media somehow makes one more rational or enlightened is just fucking obnoxious. Either pitch in with something actually helpful or do us all a favor and go be smart somewhere else."

Anarchism,fomkp57,t3_g88q8m,1587893660.0,"I realize that this is an ironic post to use for finger pointing, but lets emphasize the ""love and solidarity"" part as much as possible. Because there are some really bad example anarchists out there. In fact I gave up on collective action for quite a while there years ago because of how consistently unwelcomed I felt showing up to events alone and finding that I was not allowed at the cool kids table. It didn't hurt my feelings, I had other friends that wern't anarchists, but I found it extremely discouraging and really just baffling. In my mind, if youre not always ready to welcome someone into your fold and greet others in solidarity of a shared goal, then I question your anarchism. I came to assume that most of these guys just liked gutterpunk music and hated their fathers and believed that that made them anarchists. And excuse me, but hell no. It's not what you're against, its what you're for. It's respecting that voice in your heart that naturally tells us pack animals what's wrong and whats right. Anarchy is not a reactionary movement; it's a progressive one. And the very soul of it is people coming together to nurture the best parts of us.

Yo it's 430am here and I'm not sure this is saying what I hope it is, I might fome clean it up later. But hopefully y'all are follwing the gist. Kindness is paramount. Make new acquaintances and make them feels welcome. Love and solidarity."

Holy shit! Somebody with absolutely no authority or significant influence over a particular issue has said a thing about it! Get mad!

I'm not criticising you, OP, it's the media. Even if it is only the Post. I do not care how bored that particular journalist was on that particular day, ""Harvard Professor Has An Opinion"" is not a story. It's literally not news. 

I honest-to-God feel that the primary function of all mainstream media is to turn the public inward; to make me hate me. See because now this article, insignificant as it is, will go into somebody roster of talking points as what ""they're"" saying. It'll go something like ""Yeah, I guess it's not enough that we have to let trans-whatevers into our little daughter's restrooms, now *they're saying* that we can't even homeschool our kids anymore! It's never enough!"" 

And no one will ask who ""they"" are, and no one will ask if anybody is listening to what ""they"" say. And, most importantly, no one will question whether it's even the same ""they"". Because of course it's the same they; because anybody not ""us"" is automatically ""them"". And we'll keep shoving more and more of our neighbors into smaller and smaller boxes, all the while screaming our lungs out, and *NOT because the corporations and the banks and the government they officially own are robbing us all blind equally,* but because we're outraged that the people (our neighbors) who we've been generalizing, demonizing, and then dismissing, are doing the same thing to us. Can you believe that bullshit, man? They said we're **ALL** HSKWNWBI's, when actually, **THEY""RE** the ones who like to LBQUQKEB!! Is that stupid or what??? Anyway, I have to get back to using alchemy to make this $1,200 check last 10 weeks before my family starves to death. See ya!
