I don’t have a lot of money and the stimulus check only affords me a few months of rent, and that’s only if I have literally no other expenses for the next two months.

I know I’m not alone. The fact that there hasn’t been any sort of rent freeze/reduction or more government assistance announced is ridiculous. Why are landlords not expected to make sacrifices like the rest of us? How are people supposed to do the right thing when they literally can’t afford to?"

I have a dull headache and my brain feels heavy. I’m also extremely tired. It might be a depression flare-up, but I’m staying in my room because you don’t know. Now I’m feeling immense guilt over going into work a few times during the past week and talking to my roommates, and not paying mind to potential symptoms. I haven’t even gone to the bathroom today because I share it with my roommates and I don’t want to get them sick. It’s tough. I’m hideously depressed over this. Been in bed all day. I have no motivation or desire to do anything else, for fear that I’ve put people I care about in danger and infected them.

It could all be symptoms of depression/anxiety. I don't want to call a doctor with my shit because there are people out there who are actually sick. You're staying in, you're doing what you can do to avoid transmission and flatten the curve. It's super tough to have OCD during this time. I doubt every thing I think, feel, and do. It's scary.

I’d be deathly afraid to touch anything. I’d wash my hands regularly, but is that enough? Seems like conventional wisdom is that now is the time to stay home, to buy time and see who has it.

fantanoforever,f7nn2va,t1_f7nj7nr,1573910895.0,"Kind of insane that all the major music blogs love to shit on Fantano, yet he was on Rosalía (among many other artists) way before every single one of them. I think a lot of the shit-talking from music bloggers about Fantano (I see a fair amount of it on Twitter) is out of fear/jealousy. Basically Fantano built a better mousetrap."
indieheads,f7n233x,t1_f7myzzu,1573881323.0,"I don't know if anything's changed since this morning, but I was able to stream it on the Bandcamp app without buying it (I did end up buying a copy, but I was able to stream it beforehand)"
indieheads,f7l9bzo,t1_f7ku4hk,1573835540.0,"It seems like you can listen to it free on Bandcamp. I’ll probably end up buying a digital copy anyway (gotta support the Bon), but it’s there."
indieheads,f7l70y8,t1_f7kuiwr,1573834073.0,"I work at a record store. Can confirm we have the LP and CD in stock today.

Can also confirm that the “singles” are not actually on the record. Which is sort of sad (they’re amazing songs) but very funny and very Bonnie."
indieheads,f7k44tg,t1_f7h1xgw,1573794133.0,Not to mention that the guitar solo is literally the melody of “The Star-Spangled Banner”. I didn’t catch that on the first listen.
depression,f7grwex,t3_dw2n5i,1573714661.0,"I have fantasies all day, every day (probably more appropriate to call them delusions at this point) that I'm a successful writer, or musician, or have a partner, or whatever. I know they're unrealistic and I should probably give them up, but as a few people have said in this thread, they keep me going. It's a comfort to think that someday I'll have a life like the one I picture for myself in my head, despite the fact that it will never happen, and I'm taking no steps toward making it happen."
alexcameron,f7g7yu1,t3_dvzhxo,1573696881.0,I’ve been listening to the new Black Marble quite a bit the past few days - it’s called ‘Bigger Than Life’.  His stuff sounds a little JTS-y.
depression,f7dt77h,t3_dvebhg,1573628814.0,"I constantly worry that I'm ""faking"" my depression for attention. I constantly worry that everyone else thinks the same. It's like a bonus layer of hell. Good stuff, brain!"
pics,f7covmc,t1_f7c2tie,1573596868.0,"He posts on r/The_Delusional, so it was probably some fake headline someone posted there and everyone fell for it."
Trumpgret,f79k8c5,t3_duscv9,1573508805.0,"Depends. I think this is one of those “actions speak louder than words” scenarios. If a “friend” came to me and said this, it’d be lip service until they took some real, meaningful actions to atone for supporting such evil for the last three years."
shoegaze,f79jnle,t3_duxfur,1573508563.0,"Westkust. They have a few albums but ‘Last Forever’ is some great, fast, catchy shoegaze."
Justfuckmyshitup,f77z7pj,t1_f76oz0y,1573480775.0,"God, what an underrated comedy. I might watch that tonight."
indieheads,f749hsu,t1_f73xr74,1573399520.0,I still gotta dive deeper on them! I like the songs I’ve heard.
indieheads,f72mdao,t1_f71sn8k,1573368734.0,"Obviously they should do right by all their bands, but man, SOTB is probably one of the best guitar bands going right now. So unbelievably good."
indieheads,f7155j2,t3_du0h55,1573336251.0,"It sucks how you can’t even trust indie labels to be fair to artists anymore. I remember Grizzly Bear, around when their last record came out, say that indies are now acting as shady as the majors used to. I guess they were right.

All I know is that Tiny Engines better not be fucking over Spirit Of The Beehive, because their music is so good that they should all be millionaires."
