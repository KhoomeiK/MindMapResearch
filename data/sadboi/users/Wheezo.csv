LeonaMains,fpg6wnq,t3_gd9shs,1588595921.0,"I've been playing quite a bit of Leona too, but I'm not high elo at all, so take my opinions with a grain of salt.

As for what adc I like to play with, basically anyone with a dash that can get onto whoever I E as fast as possible, so Lucian, kaisa, ezreal. Jinx and jhin are both really good if they know how to time their cc since you can go e -> jhin root/jinx traps -> q for a ridiculously long cc chain level 2.

I had some problems using my power spike properly too, but recently I feel like I got it pretty much down. Leona is extremely strong early game, but that doesn't mean that you should go in 100% of the time every game as soon as you ding level 2. What you should do instead is always keep your eyes open for your opponent's positioning, and punish even the smallest mistake either of them do. Your level 3 is even stronger, which means that if you burn their flash at level 2 and they stay in lane you *will* get a kill if they fuck up even once. Honestly, your level 3 is so good that if you ding before them you can go in for a kill 99% of the time. 

Looking at the list of the supports you struggle against, honestly lux and Janna shouldn't be too much of a problem to you. If you manage to dodge their only cc you can go in and out-trade them, or even kill them, very early in the game. The only problem of playing vs a lux is her poke, if she gets you a cuple of times you basically lose your chance to go in, unless you have potions or cookies left (I take them every time vs poke botlanes). As for Morgana, I always ban her. 100% of the time. There is not a single less fun support to face in the entire game in my opinion. 

As for when you should avoid level 2 fights:

a) your adc is obviously not on the same page as you, and you feel like he won't follow into your e. Forcing stuff at level 2 with an unwilling adc is basically a death wish.

b) you get poked and your hp is below ~60-70%

c) you are pushed near/under their tower"

Either my adc pushes and we end up under their turret by level 2.5 or the enemy laners position in a way that makes engaging really hard. 

I was suggested soraka by friends too, but I really like the playstyle of champs like leona or Nautilus, I don't really have any interest in enchanters. 

Should I just go in every time at level 2? I basically on go in when I can see a perfect opportunity, is Leona sufficiently strong for me to engage in suboptimal conditions?"

So basically just ask yourself if not having a wire is worth 60€ to you, and decide for yourself. Also keep in mind that a witless mouse might not have ""cable drag"" (which is completely negligible in my opinion) but it's probably heavier than a wired mouse, so even if you where to lose 1 gram worth of drag on the cable you might gain 4-5 on the mouse itself."

That means that I'd have to get absolutely blasted 12 times in a month to blow away 610€ which is most likely not going to happen.  Or 33 times drinking beer. So not exactly ""a couple of times"" really"
