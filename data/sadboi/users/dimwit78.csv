depression,f83tpzl,t3_dyazjo,1574220683.0,"I’m 100% with you. Teenage son. Married. My family is wonderful and I’m unfortunately mired in the tar and sludge of clinical depression.  I thought it would get better with age but at 40, it’s only gotten worse. The most miserable part is that I lack the constitution for suicide. I fantasize about it. Sometimes I think I’ve had enough and I’m ready. I think of hanging myself in the garage. It sounds soothing but I just can’t do it. Cursed, it seems. But I guess we just don’t get off that easy. Maybe you and I both owe it to our families to try to get well. I’m sick of trying and failing but no one seems to give up on me. So I shouldn’t give up either. Maybe just owing our loved ones is enough to scrape by till the sun shines again. And maybe trying will eventually lead to successfully managing this rotten disease. Because it’s never going away. It’s something that has to be managed like diabetes or high blood pressure, or any other medical condition. Turn your back for a minute and it has you again. I get it. I feel you. I understand, I’m sure it turns your stomach to hear it, but you already know that it gets better. It cycles and cycles and cycles through up and down. The clouds will part again. Gotta hang on and force yourself to do things that alleviate the pain. Just hang on. I’m sure trying to. I hope you will too."

Her feelings are most likely overwhelming her and it’s coming out as anger. Give her a minute to process what you’ve said. When the dust settles, she’ll probably try to continue the conversation and find a solution. If she doesn’t, try talking to her again. Just be open and honest. Leave anger and blame out of it. Sometimes our feelings come out in weird ways and our actions aren’t always in sync with how we feel. Just gotta keep communicating."
