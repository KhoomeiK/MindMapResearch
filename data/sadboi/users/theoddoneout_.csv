Personally I don‚Äôt think the falls are worth it for such a short stay, especially walking.

As you mentioned, you‚Äôre a nature/active person. I strongly suggest taking a surf lesson, trying out diving, or going snorkeling. It is 100% worth it, especially if you haven‚Äôt before. Especially the diving. The water scene is truly amazing, and was my favorite part of Hawaii."
