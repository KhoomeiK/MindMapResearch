It's what you do with that energy that matters.  It's over, it passed, it still hurts?  Accept it, understand it, and learn from it.  That's the only way to make it go away.  Trust me, no amount of xanax will solve this."

Even your GP might be able to be a source of help for you; although be careful taking anti-depressants if you have bipolar, since it can swing you manic (it swung me!).  

My psych and I were talking about this exact thing today, since I've been having really bad mixed episodes lately.  She said that positive affirmations can be really helpful.  It may feel stupid to look at yourself in a mirror and say, ""I'm beautiful.  I have worth.  I matter.""  However stupid it may sound, you'll start to believe it.

Then there's the brain fog, which doesn't help since I'm getting an advanced degree.  The klutziness and lightheadedness.  The weight gain - oh the weight gain - most of my anxiety attacks come from when I'm getting dressed.  I can barely leave the house.

The crying fits in public don't help either.  Yup, I got the tattoo, too.  Plus drug use, then the deep fall after they wear off.
