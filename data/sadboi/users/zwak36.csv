TooAfraidToAsk,fo7ht3l,t3_g65lnk,1587578570.0,I feel the same way I'm super thankful that I'm still working full 40 hour weeks as a mechanic. However I could really use that 2000 bucks to get some shit done! Like catch up on credit cards or bills. Then I see my friends and family just blowing it all away on stupid shit so yea I'm a little jealous. Call me a asshole or whatever doesn't change how I feel.

lonely,fdeeuxv,t3_ekyc5k,1578337497.0,"Hello, I'm not sure what your going through but you got to eat bud! I'm single living alone and I get it I've been there just wanting the day to end and skipping meals or not eating dinner at all and getting that sick feeling in your gut. (wich makes me hesitant to eat) But I've come to learn that cooking is a very rewarding task! It helps fill in those long evenings and keep your mind occupied. like I said I don't know what life is throwing your way but I hope this helps. Peace and Love! ;)"

depression,ewvhwe1,t3_cq9m72,1565806555.0,This is true I only just joined Reddit for this reason and it worked. For the first time in a very long time I went home after work and didn't feel like a burden to the world. I didn't sit and feel guilty for wasting the days away. I  finally felt like I wasn't alone anymore. I still have a long ways to go but it's a start. So to anyone reading this post or my comment you are not alone. stay strong and keep your stick on the ice!
depression,ewsl7nj,t1_ewsl4h2,1565729833.0,Haha I see I already fucked that up ment to reply to the message
depression,ewsl4h2,t3_cpwu38,1565729781.0,I only just joined Reddit thought maybe it would be a place where I could start writing down my problems. But I mostly watch YouTube or anime just to distract myself in the evenings. Do you dread the weekends or consecutive days off? I almost wish I could just stay at work sometimes.
depression,ews6q3g,t3_cpwu38,1565721324.0,Ya bud me too almost everyday.
depression,ewp6ahd,t3_cd0hjp,1565634379.0,"Wow you just described my day to day life. I've recently lost the two people in my life that I really could open up to and talk without being judged. I thought ""Hey your just sad and eventually it will pass things will get better"" but it doesn't it's just day in and day out 365 days a year. I'm getting really tired and I just don't know what to do anymore. Nothing interests me I don't go out and when I do I feel like I bring everyone down around me. I just want to cry but I can't there is just no emotion left just a constant soreness of the mind and body. Stay cool everybody thanks for listening."
depression,ewnvucz,t3_cp2zuk,1565592967.0,To another shitty yearüçª cheers mate!
