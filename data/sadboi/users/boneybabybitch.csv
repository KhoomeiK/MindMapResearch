Sautéed some garlic, broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms, and spinach in Braggs liquid aminos, then added in well rinsed, drained, and boiled noodles. Let everything simmer in the liquid aminos for a while, before putting in a bowl and topping with a little Sriracha. *chefs kiss*

I know this isn’t groundbreaking but it was really easy to make and really good!"

I used to feel like a fraud because I felt like I “forced” some of these habits that now are my default setting. Through reflection, I figured out that my eating disorder habits when I was 12 years old (I am now 31) would not continue for all these years if I were a fraud.

The point is, it’s not your fault. This disease is, after all, a mental illness. It distorts your ability to think and act rationally at times. It may not mean much coming from a stranger on the internet, but I hope it helps to know that you are not alone."
