If she threatens to kill herself again, have her committed. Don't ask, just do it.

I was in this position in 2015 after I had a nervous breakdown. I was told in no uncertain terms that if I thought about harming myself or others (I attacked my husband in the process of my breakdown) that I HAD to go to hospital. My husband knew this, and was instructed to take me in based on certain signs. 

Your poor wife needs more help and better help than she has had. She needs to be told that her meds are not negotiable and she needs to takw them every day. Zoloft (which I am still on to this day) has tough side effects in the beginning but they do get better for lots of people.

You must also look after yourself, since the spouse of someone with mental health issues can get overlooked in the need to help the other. Seek counselling for the extra support you need.

Good luck."

If I were the Louvre, I wouldn't want to pay the premiums on a huge ransom amount just in case it gets stolen (unlikely with current security measures).

The thing is, selling something like the ML, the amount would be influenced by so many factors that there is no real way to establish a 'market value'. Any amount it sells for would be arbitrary and linked to what the buyer is willing to pay. The amount someone is willing to pay is not really correlated to the actual, verifiable value of the item."

NoStupidQuestions,fqt7omm,t1_fqt79ys,1589632456.0,"The insuring of voices, legs etc is a different KIND of insurance, called non-indemnity insurance. The most common example of this is life insurance. We can't assign a value to a life, a voice etc so it is literally an arbitrary value chosen by the insured person that they think their life etc is worth. Often linked to earning capacity, but like I said, it is an arbitrary value.

I am not arguing that the crown jewels have NO monetary value, just that they are irreplaceable, so even assigning a value to them and getting a payout does not replace the historical significance lost if they are stolen or destroyed."
NoStupidQuestions,fqt70my,t1_fqt6mc8,1589631908.0,"No, the materials used always have intrinsic value, although very low.

The availability of a substantially similar replacement is the key. If the artist is alive and can repaint, then an item is not one of a kind.

NoStupidQuestions,fqt6jji,t1_fqt6327,1589631508.0,"Ok, so for the Crown Jewels, there are a number of stones that are of such a size, clarity and quality that they can not be replaced. The purpose of insurance is to replace or compensate you for what you have lost - if the item you have insured is irreplaceable, there was no point insuring it in the first place - hence uninsurable.

For the Mona Lisa, there are other paintings my Da Vinci, but no other Mona Lisa that is similar enough to the one in the Louvre to be considered a suitable replacement."
NoStupidQuestions,fqt6e49,t1_fqt682v,1589631379.0,"There are, but the one that has preserved in the Louvre has certain additional details that make it particularly unique - the finer details in the face, for example."
NoStupidQuestions,fqt684k,t1_fqt61uv,1589631236.0,"Great question! 

There are a couple of factors: the artist is no longer living; none of his other works are similar for comparison purposes; and the historical importance of the painting. There are a few examples of artworks that can't be insured - the Sistene Chapel, the Last Supper, the statue of the David."
NoStupidQuestions,fqt5hu2,t1_fqt50og,1589630597.0,"That is an interesting question.

I would say that in such a case you aren't insuring the painting ITSELF but rather the earning capacity of the painting, and you would have to prove how much money the painting on its own brings in to the museum. Very difficult to quantify. Because if you want to claim, you must claim for the exact amount you have lost as a result of no longer having the painting.

Edit to say that the reason you musr prove the exact income the painting would earn you is because the cardinal rule of insurance is that you are not allowed to make a profit, the purpose is only cover financial loss already incurred.

I am going to use this one on my students next year, thank you!"
NoStupidQuestions,fqt46nj,t1_fqsinza,1589629400.0,"Fun fact: the Mona Lisa, being the only work of its kind, can not be assigned a value. It is literally priceless. And it can't be replaced because well, Leonardo is dead. This means that it can't be insured, because you can only insure for intrinsic value not historical or sentimental value. So the Mona Lisa is not insured. See also: crown jewels of the UK; Colosseum in Rome

She died in 2013 when they were both early 50s and he was LOST. I was still living at home and he then expected me to take over where she left off and I said fuck that. So he HAD to learn to do certain things himself.
