SuicideWatch,fr4wh64,t1_fr3627m,1589898189.0,"Same. Specially after I read about people who attempted, survived and regretted suicide. Holy F. It seems the Eternity of Nothing is something common with suicide survivors. But the Dark Hug of Eternal Nothing seems to be experienced by deaths not caused by your own. I've also been obsessed wnthe Great Unknown and NEDs. I've never once seen a suicide survivor who saw, felt something nice. I had no idea this could be possible. Nothing has taken away my suicide ideation like reading suicide NEDs. Maybe it's not real. Maybe it's your brain trying to survive. I have Sleep Paralysis so I experience terrifying things that feel, look and sound real. But they aren't. In the moment when you have a demon sitting on your chest, it doesn't matter at all that it's not real. If it feels real, that's how you experience it and if this is what suicide regret does, Jaysus Effing C. I wish this was taught in school when we're teenagers"

Not w grandma. She had a brain stroke and had a DNR (do not resuscitate). She was alive on her own for 2 days. We all talked to her constantly and hugged her. When she passed she left - body and soul. My grandad has wished us all that sort of death - so peaceful and her Soul  didn't stay.

The road will never be the same bcs theres a damn boulder. The road will stop there for a very painful very long time. Eventually the road might continue around it. It's like jumping out of a plane and trying to brainstorm how to get back in the plane. You can think of deploying the parachute but getting on the plane is not an option.

SuicideWatch,fl4h4wq,t3_fmgaji,1584813421.0,"Before you do... Look at survivors stories. Not only instant regret, death was not the warm black hug they thought. I've heard it described as utterly terrifying. Quicksand. Sludge. The sound, taste and feel of endless nothing. The dark. Talk to someone who realized they made the worst mistake of their life. You need to understand."
SuicideBereavement,fl3y358,t3_fma4jo,1584801359.0,"This is so honest. Children give us such perspective. I hope she always stays honest to her feelings amd doesn't feel the need to keep quiet or keep it inside6as she grows older. There is no healing or recovery from this. There is a new life and her honesty can be the way to find light in this new world of despair and horror that you didn't want or ask for. Your life was also taken away but you're alive. The no filter of a child,their brutal, devastatingly honesty and at the same time levity will be the way the light gets back in."

Dreams,fkyk0a4,t3_fla7xd,1584650262.0,"This classic textbook sleep paralysis. Never open your eyes during an episode. You are paralized but your optic nerve still works. And with all the panic hormones in your body they go out via the only workable part of your body :the eyes. This is why you see the worst things your mind can come up with.
People in traumatic situations say they prefer to live through that trauma than another sleep paralysis event. The fear centre of the brain is close to the pleasure center. Don't open your eyes and think about pleasure :food and sex. It won't make the demon go away but it can help shorter the paralysis. Don't. Open. Your. Eyes"

SuicideBereavement,fkqysut,t1_fkq940m,1584458442.0,Thank you for setting the record straight! Impulsivity is across the spectrum. About the brain development both empirically and peer reviews confirm thr brain doesn't mature until 25. Kids genuinely can't graps something so permanent like death. I see it w kids and I remember it myself. I also saw a documentary of when children kill and the kids who are interviewed as adults all coincide that death was not a concept they could graps
