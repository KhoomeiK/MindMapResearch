lexapro,fpatmwb,t1_fpamp5f,1588455460.0,"Thanks for the comment. Yea, I should. Hopefully by tomorrow."
lexapro,fpa50mu,t3_gc2q08,1588440939.0,"I missed yesterday's dose and I'll be missing today's because the person bringing my medication to me couldn't get to where I am because of the lockdown. Lexapro is scarce where I live currently in Nigeria,so I had to order from another state. I should be getting them tomorrow.

Hope i'll be okay, I've been on it for four months and they've been really helping me. Hope skipping two days won't have a negative effect."
lexapro,fpa4zyr,t3_gc2q08,1588440929.0,The lockdown sucks
lexapro,fm5sx99,t1_flv3j92,1585779312.0,"Thanks. I understand she's doing everything because of her love but the lack of understanding about mental illness in my community seem to be affecting. 

She doesn't believe it's a medical condition. I've spent most of my time being at home trying to make my family understand this. 

I explained to my mum that they're some things I can't take with  antidepressants, yet some of the pastors she's been taking me to have been giving me stuffs to take and they are interfering with the drug. 

Just last week, I was given a drink made with lime. I had headache throughout the day, I later found out online that lime and antidepressants don't miss well."
mentalhealth,flt528c,t3_fqib8w,1585459493.0,"I'm being Dragged From One Religious Center To Another. 

I was dealing with depression and anxiety for sometime on my own. I was living in a different city away from home when it started so my parents were not aware. I started taking medications in January. Being on it has helped in returning home to explain what I've been going through to my parents.  

Being from Nigeriaâ€”a country in the western part of Africa, it's been difficult for my parents to see my depression as a mental illness rather they believe it's a spiritual attack that requires a spiritual approach. My mum believes it's the work of witches from our family. 

I returned home seeking for their support and understanding instead I'm being dragged from one pastor to another for prayers and it's becoming exhausting for me to bear.

My mum has been has been so worried and I know she cares so much but it's so difficult to explain what  depression is to her, especially since she believes it's a witch attacking me. That alone makes me sad. 

Africa is still a continent that doesn't see mental illness as a real thing and it makes me sadder."
antidepressants,flcwrc7,t1_flcrg4o,1585049597.0,"Thanks for the comment. Yeah, the dynamics in each families varies and these can play a major role in seeking help for mental health issues. Africa still remains a continent that believes so much in black voodoo. A cat lurking around your window at night is termed as bad luck. The low level of education in Africa is not helping either. 

So far my depression is seen as a spiritual attack instead of a medical condition that requires medical attention. It's so sad. 

Presently, I'm choking from the amount of religious materials and 'men of God' my mum has been running to rather than accepting my illness and supporting  my medication regime.

I'm presently in a state in the southern part of Nigeria."
Anxiety,flcvxpl,t1_flcp4ff,1585048708.0,"I hope so too. One of the challenges we face as Africans is the lack of mental health professionals and awareness. So far Africans have to resort to worship centers headed by semi-illeterate pastors with little or no knowledge about psychology or how the human brain works. 

As I write I'm currently in one of those worship centers with my mum to see a 'man of God'. I had to oblige to following her to put her mind at rest. The past few days has been overwhelming for me and I'm stressed out from listening to all those people telling me I'm being afflicted by the devil or a witch."
Anxiety,flcv9al,t1_flcm1vq,1585047962.0,"I'm sorry about your issue. I was skeptical about taking medication at first but so far it's been an effective tool in managing my depression. 

They aren't happy pills but they've helped in putting things in perspective. It's a step in  recovery. Others tools being support and care which I was hoping to receive by opening up to my folks but their ignorance about mental health issues and pressure (though not devoid of love) is overwhelming."
