careerguidance,fot0nh5,t1_fosz5cn,1588042035.0,"My boss is the project manager.

I tried to escalate things earlier today. Just an email with my concerns about the client and why. My boss called me and accused me of venting and asked me like by line about the email. When we got towards the end he started lying about some of the things he said in meetings last week & I was so tired of dealing with his shit that I didn’t argue. The call turned into other things, I brought up my emails with questions he ignored for 2 weeks. And he that’s when he started talking about needing to do the final qc check for the side project.

After the call I started to feel like I’d been played, like maybe the higher ups that I escalated the problem to, were listening in on the call and that’s why my boss kept doubling down/lying about stuff? I don’t have any other reason he would call me like that and argue/lie to me as if he’s trying to convince me? 

Either way, I feel like I blew my opportunity to escalate things, my boss is currently in retaliation mode and if the covid crisis wasn’t a thing, I’d be looking for a new job.

There is a different project manager I go to for advice a lot. Everyone’s working from home, so it feels weird now. I can’t just message him and say “my boss is lying and I’ve lost the energy to stand up for myself.”"
careerguidance,fosybyq,t1_fosv75b,1588040617.0,"I actually did that for a while. Whenever the new guy started a new task, I’d start it with him and go over the steps and what to do and what the expectations were.

On tasks where he stumbled a lot, I created guides to help him understand. And then when he still didn’t get it, I created a project specific color costed instruction manual so he could just look at this color and see what the correct action would be. It still needed reworking afterwards. Either I spent half my day giving him instructions to get a pretty decent product or I spend half my day telling him to redo it, over and over. 

I told him he needed to start a task, quickly mark down what he thought the steps towards the deliverable would be and then contact me so that we could see where he’s starting off right and there he’s stumbling. Then he could correct mistakes at the beginning instead of after they’ve snowballed. He never followed through and would just complete the whole task, sometimes incorrectly. 

I got really mad , told him I was mad, and ended up just letting him do what he wanted cause I was tired of forcing him to communicate and cause I was being dumped on by my boss -who kept refusing to talk to the new guy at all and started getting mad at me cause I was falling behind on my work. There were a few times I tried to pick it back up again, but I didn’t have time to create instructions so it felt like I was micromanaging.

He’s better now, he has a better grasp of the basics, but still struggles with anything that’s not explicit and everything he does requires multiple re-checks for accuracy.

The problem is my boss doesn’t understand the time it took to get the new guy up to speed or that he still needs help.so now I don’t have time for the upfront instructions and were behind schedule, so now I’m in a position where I just have to fix things myself. Which sucks.

We have daily team calls, which are status updates and my boss is supposed to discuss schedule, but makes me do it.  I do manage up, as much as I can. It’s hard when my boss undermines all my decisions, makes me do stupid things that waste time, doesn’t pay attention in meetings and flat out lies when he thinks he can get away with it.

We’re supposed to have a preliminary qc check and a final one. He made me skip the preliminary one on a side project we have right now and just do the final. Even though the project wasn’t that far along.  Now he’s all talking about how we need to wrap that project up and do a final qc check. Which I’m sure he’s going to make me do, even though I already “did it” and it’s technically his responsibility. (Not to mention that the prelim qc check takes 1/3 the time as the final. So by doing it twice we’re wasting more than 8hrs of the total budget. I tried to tell him he’d skipped the prelim and he didn’t listen to me/didn’t care/still forced me to do the final)."

When we have status updates with the client, he dumps things on me after withholding information. Your right though, he really likes to run the working meetings. I don’t think he pays any attention to what anyone else says during the calls tho.

Depending on the type of meeting, the whole meeting/all meeting notes are to do notes. It’s just a matter of whether they’re administrative or actionable tasks. The notes just provide direction. 

I said in my post that he hands me the info and says it’s up to date, I forgot to say that during meetings, the client tells me it’s not.

When we were working in office I could meet up with him before meetings, but now he just ignores my calls/messages till it’s convenient for him. And skips planned calls with our team. When I call him to find out what’s up, he says he doesn’t want to talk to the whole team and will start giving me info so I can pass it along to the 1-2 other people. Instead of just him talking to the group.

Our current project ends in the next few weeks and at this rate, it will be too late. I should’ve escalated things sooner, but didn’t have any proof that the client was fed up. I only had my frustrations.

I like the idea of calling him out in front of the client. But if I do it once, then he’ll just stop including me in the meetings. He’s done that in the past.

AskDocs,fofl84h,t1_fe233uw,1587738206.0,"I have POTS and would like to provide some awareness as to why I balk at the “functional component.”

When I first got sick, I was misdiagnosed with depression and then bipolar disorder. I was put on psych meds (with known side effects of suicidal thoughts). When I complained about the sudden intrusive thoughts, I was sent to a hospital and put on stronger meds-causing stronger thoughts. Starting a cycle that would last 10yrs.

I was sent to therapy for CBT and taught to ignore my symptoms. Which I did well. And as they got worse my coping skill got stronger. Till everything fell apart last year.

I hit a parked car at work and was so confused and caused more damage than the initial impact left. I was embarrassed, but I coped, by ignoring and moving on.

Things got worse over the next few weeks and I fainted while I was driving to work. I ignored it as much as I could, by continuing to drive to work when I came to. Ended up leaving and driving myself to the ER where they ran some tests then treated me like a drug seeking faker. 

I had a moment of self awareness and started to wean myself off the psych meds. Every time I reduced the dose, the suicidal thoughts got worse for 1-2days and then got way better. When I finally stopped the meds. They finally went away. Relief. Finally. After a decade. Relief from something that doctors did to me.

 Several months later, I saw a neurologist. Who told me that my problems were psychosomatic and that I’d fainted while driving cause I had anxiety. He said if I really lost consciousness, that local law requires he suspend my license. But he didn’t believe my story, kept trying to get me to change it, and when I wouldn’t, he did it himself “so I wouldn’t lose my license for no reason.”

I was diagnosed with dysautonomia a few months later and POTS was confirmed with a TTT shortly after that. I’ve had episodes while driving since, but since I know what’s happening, I’m able to pull over at the onset of symptoms. 

My current GP says that since I spent so many years ignoring my symptoms, that I actually do the opposite of what everyone else told me. My physical symptoms create/become mental ones. She also told me that I’m not ever going to get better and sometimes I’m going to get worse. POTS might not be progressive, but whatever’s causing mine is. 

When you say you don’t like that POTS patients suggest that they’re sicker than other people, I get that you’re frustrated. But that’s kind of like saying to clean your plate because there are starving people in Africa. And I certainly don’t dismiss others because I have POTS (pre or post diagnosis) I’m saying that I’m in pain, I’m suffering PLEASE HELP ME. 

Since I’ve received my diagnosis, I haven’t had to go to the ER once. But before, doctors would send me all the time cause of my “alarming” symptoms which would be dismissed once I got there. (Strengthening the cycle and making it harder to get any help at all). Increasing awareness and treatment for POTS will reduce the medical burden from undiagnosed cases desperate for help.

Functional medicine approach put me in a position where I could accidentally kill an innocent bystander. I sure as hell would never forgive myself for that. But the doctors I’ve begged for help from can?

AskDoctorSmeeee,foe3prf,t3_g6x3ew,1587695411.0,"NAD, but I also have facial nerve pain. My doctor calls it [Trigeminal neuralgia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_neuralgia). I have it in both sides of my face. Started as Bells Palsy both times, but the paralysis healed and the nerve pain remained.  It started on the right side in November, and they didn’t give me meds. When it started in the left side of my face they gave me methyl which helped a little bit-the paralysis didn’t spread as bad and went away fast, but the pain was extreme (now the right side of my face is always very swollen and stiff and the left side isn’t as swollen and is easier to use, but the pain is similar on both sides).

They don’t know what’s causing it, but it’s not caused by anxiety. Right now my chart says idiopathic. I also have peripheral neuropathy and POTS.  It took me 10yrs to get a diagnosis-everyone told me I was crazy, depressed or anxious. It took a personal referral to a doctor who specializes in difficult to diagnose cases/people who’ve been ignored, to get help. 

When I first got sick, they put me on psych meds that had bad side effects (made me suicidal) and doctors used that as an excuse to say I had a mental problem and that I was physically healthy without bothering to look further. I stopped the psych meds and for the first time in years, had relief from the intrusive suicidal thoughts. Psych meds are also a standard treatment for nerve pain, which is what your symptoms sound like to me. (Your pain sounds very similar to mine, but also different)

My new doctor tested me for Lyme and I got a false positive reading (2 blots came back positive, but 5 are needed). All of my bloodwork comes back normal, every time. But there aren’t blood tests for nerve problems. My nerve tests come back abnormal. 

I take a very low dose of gabapentin now and it’s enough to take the edge off my pain. I also take propanerolol and am supposed to start florinef tomorrow.

I would recommend looking for a neurologist. They specialize in the nervous system and could help. Also, if your in the US, message me and if your close I’ll give you my doctors info."

A neurologist can help. When you have your phone appointment with the nurse. You don’t want to show any anxiety or act as if your symptoms are causing anxiety. Even showing distress can sometimes be too much/perceived as emotional. (I called when I almost fainted while driving and was freaked - they acted offput. I called when my face was paralyzed and was calm cause it’d happened before and they were shocked and jumped to help, they also took the car fainting story more seriously). 

Doctors feel like a brick wall sometimes and it’s so frustrating cause they’re supposed to help people who are suffering but they make it so hard. Are there any other rheumatologists in the area or do you have to go to that one?

I’d get them all your test results before the appointment if you can. And have your symptoms and timeline all written down so everything’s put together during the appointment. If it’s a phone appointment, then you’ll want it written down on paper so you can see it without having to close out the appointment app. Try to stay calm during, but it’s ok to show your suffering. Does that make any sense?

I’m sorry that you’re suffering. I hope you get help soon."

neuropathy,fo1cst3,t3_g54cdb,1587430497.0,"Keep an eye on your mental state after starting any antidepressants/anxiety meds. If mentally you feel worse, then stop taking them/talk to your doctor. I’m also suspicious of any doctor that claims health conditions are caused by anxiety. At the very least, it means they don’t want to bother looking for other causes. 

It took me a long time to get a neuropathy diagnosis, (I was told I was crazy for years before anyone did anything about it) but when they did, my doctor did a full workup including tests for diabetes and Lyme. There are other causes besides lupus and MS. Yours sounds like it might be acute though? Since it started suddenly? You said your ANA was high? What pattern/titer?

It’s weird to me that your doctor diagnosed neuropathy and just left it at that. I’d still try to get an appointment with the rheumatologist. Do they do phone appointments?

neuropathy,fo0pumv,t1_fo0o5gp,1587417549.0,"Hmmmmm. I would think that for “anxiety” to cause low oxygen for extended periods of time-long enough to cause damage to your nervous system. That it’d have to be a really long time and be pretty severe.

Also when I search that, I don’t get reputable medical sites. When I search low blood oxygen though, I get quite a few reputable sites with lists of physical causes. Including asthma. When I look up low blood oxygen on the APA website, it says that stress usually doesn’t cause respiratory symptoms without an underlying medical condition.
