saxophone,ffillha,t3_etibm4,1579976799.0,"Do you ever try to play a low note, say low D and below, and it comes out an octave too high? thats an overtone. You can manipulate your embouchure and your throat/tongue positioning to force your instrument to produce a wide range of notes just from the low B flat, i think the highest i got to in highschool was altissimo D

The technical explanation is that whenever you play any note on your instrument, the instrument actually vibrates at a range of frequencies. this range is what gives every instrument its unique sound. the only thing that doesn't produce overtones is a tuning fork i believe."
