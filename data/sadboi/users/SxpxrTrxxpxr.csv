I haven‚Äôt burned rods since tech school and I certified in 3G flux mig. I‚Äôm confident I can pick up stick and with some practice I can cert in pipe. I have a lot of questions so bear with me. 

What certs would get my foot in the door? 
Will I need a HD truck, welder, and all those trimmings to start? 
Are there places to stay down there or will I need a camper? 
What companies should I look into? 
Is there too many welders and not enough jobs down there? 
Is work steady, OT availability? 
Do I need to be certified by the company as well?"

AskReddit,f0lwii3,t3_d5bek2,1568731253.0,"For me, I was almost constantly on the brink of suicide. I only tried to take my life once in the few years I was suicidal. Now, I‚Äôm measurably better and hardly even think about it now. What changed was my surroundings. The people who I hung out with specifically. 

They were druggies and low life people to be brutally honest. They couldn‚Äôt hold a steady, good paying job if they tried. When I hung out with them back then, they never had a serious job. We‚Äôd partake in prescription pills, weed, and alcohol in unhealthy ways.  And we‚Äôd do this daily, for weeks on end. 

Long story short I‚Äôd had enough of the hamster wheel and I jumped out. I quit being friends with them, quit smoking weed and doing pills. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve made that decision and it‚Äôs been a long road to get to where I‚Äôm at but I‚Äôm proud to say I haven‚Äôt seriously thought about it in a long time. 

Also what helped was training my brain to think more positively. Whenever I get down, I think of positive thoughts and look for the silver lining which has made me a happier person."
