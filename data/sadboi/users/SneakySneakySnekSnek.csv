Fitness,erpx5nd,t3_c31fid,1561130104.0,"Revis what you eat, look up how many grams of each macro you should consume and adjust accordingly, remember that bulking is also fat gain, not only muscle, you may also not be training yourself hard enough, or maybe too much cardio. A general rule of thumb never does more time in cardio than you do lifting weights, so if you lift weight 8 hours a week then no more than I'd say around 6-7 hours of cardio, stuff like that. prioritize protein and carbs, and I can't stress the importance of stuff like sodium and calcium, bio students know . Side note, less cardio = faster bulk but more fat gain, so you gotta find a sweet spot, experiment. use the IIFYM approach, IF IT fits your macros, so you don't feel like you're too restrictive with your food intake. Hope this helps, even just a bit"

In order to lose belly fat you gonna have to lose gta every where else, for some people they may lose it after losing fat in their arms legs etc and for others it comes first. There is no manner of targeting your belly fat specifically, it's an overall process. Also try to reduce your caloric intake by about 500. So you lose fat and not too much muscle, but it losing muscle doesn't concern you then you can restrict your caloric intake by more than 500, like 700 or 1000.but I wouldn't recommend that last one. And drink lots of water, it'll help with the cravings. Lastly, stick to a plan, and don't cheat :). You got this"
