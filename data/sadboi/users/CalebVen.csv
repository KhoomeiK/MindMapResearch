It's funny to have this hobby, because sometimes when I go out with my friends to some place with nature they always keep walking while I stay behind, and at some point they notice that I vanished and then they find out that I stopped on the path to take pictures of flowers and plants haha."

succulents,f8hl6xe,t1_f8h7knk,1574576309.0,I meant til that the top part it's wet. The pot has drainage but the water doesn't come out at the bottom.
succulents,f8gcdob,t1_f8fei5z,1574557510.0,I just poor the water until the soil is completely wet. But maybe it's not enough.
succulents,f8eith6,t1_f8ecqpj,1574528472.0,"I water every week, and the appearance never changed since the beggining, besides the growth, so I taught it should look that way. I'll water more times to see what happens."
succulents,f7ailbm,t1_f798bme,1573530203.0,"Thank you, I made a research and I guess It can be from a grapto species. I friend gave me a lot of leaves but I didn't know the species from the mother plant."
succulents,f56b3la,t1_f55q81e,1572020950.0,"Yes, the bottom leaves feel mushy. I think it's overwatered then. I'll separate this one from the others like I said and see if the roots are rot or something, and I think I'll leave it without water on a new soil for a few days to see what happens."
succulents,f55ao6y,t1_f558rw0,1572003751.0,"Thank you, that's what I needed to know, I'll separate this one. The others look fine to me but I'll pay attention to them too."
succulents,f3ddmb2,t1_f3d4isl,1570835174.0,Thank you! I thought about that but wasn't really sure.
