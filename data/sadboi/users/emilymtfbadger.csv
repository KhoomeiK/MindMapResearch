Amd,fq10xmh,t3_ggcq2m,1589040283.0,"Look Amd could Make b550 have the same support as X570 after all X570 supports every AM4 cpu from true 1xxx-4xxx line. This is just the artificial segmentation they promised against just like not being able OC on the A320 boards as some manufacturers proved. The same goes for pcie 4.0 they could let manufacturers release updates to have them work on supported older boards. However they use the tired old excuse we don’t want to confuse the consumer. They fail to recognize most of there base is essentially prosumers and pros who can figure this stuff out and actually rtfm before even buying the product.
So yes b550 should have the same support as X570 but so  should the whole line up with exceptions made by manufacturers to exclude boards with actual issues. 
That said for those of us just getting in as we could finally afford a new machine X570 seems to be the best option as it supports the entirety of AM4 which is why this bios excuse is bull right in there own line, that and if it was real eprom storage isn’t big or expensive you could easily double or quadruple it and use old methods of segmented storage with the bios software to access it all. I digress though AMD is trying to pull a fast one here and we need to show them we won’t stand for it we want them to be the prosumers brand and the people’s champion.

As for me and those in my position X570 board prices will fall as b550 is introduced. If you are just getting grabbing an X570 board would garuntee your coverage till the end of the line allowing a cpu upgrade when they are cheaper after AM5 drops.

In my case I bought a 1600AF when they could be had for $85usd. While waiting to see what ryzen 4000 brings. As while that will be the last gen to fit into board it is the best option I see."

Worst bit they still have me on only 90mme of pain pills because they can’t arsed to do the paper work to give me a proper dose to maybe get me to something into the 2-3 range. 
God what I wouldn’t give to experience 0-1 just for a bit but with my wits about and not in a drug stupor. I have been nearly killed from untreated pain a few times including nearly killing my self when trying to get some relief from untreated pain back in 17, I woke up in the hospital with drug induced phenomena after two days in a coma when I basically tried to commit suicide from the pain. I am glad my partner found me in time and the medics saved me. I could not admit to myself for a long time what I had done and it didn’t help that my doctor and pharmacist at the time both missed a black box label that made those meds far more dangerous.

People say opioids kill and they can
But pain left in treated kills far more
