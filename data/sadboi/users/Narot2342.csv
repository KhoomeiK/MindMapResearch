DestinyTheGame,fnn3zpc,t3_g2jchb,1587083913.0,"
Destiny is more of an action FPS fashion-show than it is a looter at the core in my humble but undoubtedly downvoted opinion, and they did fuck that up with the Activision departure.

IMO they’re on the right track with random rolls of stats and perks but it’s not far enough in regards to being a proper looter. The core loop of the game isn’t kill stuff get loot - there’s tons of hoop jumping and checklists for a reward in Destiny and that’s just the nature of the game. It’s not about grinding loot, it’s do X 3 times and loot! Collect 250 tokens and you get some loot! This keeps the loot pool small and I’m guessing that’s the goal. It also results in the positive, the insanely great gunplay. I’d rather just dive in, kill stuff, and get loot for doing so.

Diablo 3 has loot right, Division 2 had it right (although it’s in a bad way at the moment), but with Destiny it seems like the core loop of a looter (kill stuff, loot drops, kill bigger stuff, better loot drops) aren’t what the franchise has ever aimed for."
