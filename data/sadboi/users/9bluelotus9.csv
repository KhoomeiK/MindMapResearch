BPD,f8dgksn,t3_e02t5u,1574489910.0,I was like this about a week ago. It was terrible. And no one believes you're not doing it intentionally.
BPD,f7uz8n2,t3_dxli2m,1574019296.0,No my SO/FP is extremely sick. I'm very worried.
BPD,f7rnj4s,t3_dxftx5,1573984333.0,"I've done this, too, ever since my Seroquel helped me put on 40 pounds. I also get incredibly mad at my bf for just having an attractive female cross his field of vision. I think they're all too beautiful and nice, and that I am mean and fat. What's more is I've dissociated so much of my life that I have a hard time working to make any change happen, because I'm just not there."
BPD,f7rmytl,t3_dxj747,1573984063.0,"I am always worrying. Just always. Then I get hurt when I accidentally knife my finger or knock over setting important. I am often asked if I'm ""ok"", and I forget important things all the time. I even get mad without realizing it. I don't know what to call this phenomenon. It's dangerous and it's so hard to explain to people that you forget such essential things."

BPD,f7gcxd1,t3_dvtyxx,1573700474.0,"I've always been this way. The current situation is Mr. Spock, Freddie Mercury, and ""Don't Stop Me Now"". I feel like it's a coping mechanism for escaping the world as someone who cannot physically ""get away"". It makes me feel less alone and more okay with life. It's like, even though they don't know me or have no contact with me, it's like I have supportive never annoyed with my word type of friends. I also wonder if this is a coping mechanism that I developed as an emotionally and physically neglected child. I think it's one of the better things I do with my time, though."
