I don't ever have to shovel snow (6 months a year in Canada) and I never have to worry about being stuck in traffic, also I don't experience road rage. Not owning a car becomes 100% more  savings and less maintenance. Pretty sure it's a win win since 90% of my time is my own (I don't work a real job, I flip a condo or house every couple of years), I get to take my time and enjoy life at a slower pace.

Besides, the money I save from car payments, plate taxes, insurance, driver license, maintenance and repairs, gas, parking and God knows what else, I poured into paying off my condo. The personal car is a money pit, if you're not careful you'll spend an average of 10 years of work maintaining this forced necessity. None of these companies are ever seeing a lick of my money and it's been 16 years, I'm set in my ways."

They are idiots that can barely tell the difference, to this day no doctor knows I'm bipolar I because I've never been hospitalized for my mania, just depression. It's always the same story, they lock me up for 24-48 hours, talk to me for about 10 minutes and would let me go, no medication nor therapy, just a suicide hotline number on a pre-printed card (every time I call I feel even more hopeless, I stopped because I'd self harm afterwards)

I've isolated myself completely, that'll teach people in my life to screw me over. I may not be dead, but I might as well be to them since they're dead to me. I'm doing much better, fuck anyone who tells you what's best for you, because I have yet to get any constructive help, more like everyone playing hot potato with me, because no one has a fucking clue how to deal with me and it's been quite dehumanizing. At least in jail they only take your shoes, at the mental ward, they strip you naked, drug you and strap you to a bed with belts by all fours. I'm really not a kinky girl, even less when it's four men pining me down against my will (even drugged, I apparently fight/run like I'm on PCP, I hate being held against my own will)

TL;DR Don't fucking trust anybody, the medical system is about as helpful as the prison system at helping people. People in your life ""love"" you, but at the end of the day humans care more about being able to sleep at night than actually helping. I'm glad it's in my past and it can be for you too."

Punched him in the face at least 2 dozen times, telling him to 'Fuck off!' quite aggressively and he'd still never stop, just laughed maniacally. 57 year old man fondling a 15 year old me. Shoulder rubs, grabbing my neck, playing/caressing my hair, sitting on the edge of my desk whispering answers in my ear during tests or blowing air, surprise tickling my sides as he paced behind the last row, all while teaching. Best part was that I was the only girl he did this to, so if I told someone he'd know it was me.

If I would have had access to guns (I'm Canadian) I would have brought one to school and murder-suicide us. I had brought a knife to school and came close to slashing his face, but I was afraid of getting arrested. Fucking have CPTSD from this shit. I still get flashbacks, instinctively punch people who touch my shoulders, especially if I'm sitting down. I'm touch aversed now but at least I don't burst into tears or panic attacks anymore everytime someone touches me."

If that person is happy, not salty, then who are we to judge? Having a wife to many men is viewed as a prison sentence, especially if all they want is sex on a (semi) regular basis.

This is whole reason I stopped having sex. I'm not one to gamble and reality really hit me when I got my first pregnancy scare.
