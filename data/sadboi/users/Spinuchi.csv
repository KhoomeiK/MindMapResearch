dating,fqv3f35,t1_fqv13mv,1589669086.0,Something i was originally worried about.. We were talking and moving so fast originally.. I was worried it would fade quickly too.. I think in hindsight I ended up becoming to attached/addicted to the attention
dating,fqv2wpc,t1_fqv1k5d,1589668794.0,"I got into a relationship because she was the first person in a long time I was genuinely interested in other then good looks.. I really respected her in every aspect. 

I tried communicating with this to her a few weeks prior, when I did we talked about it and she mentioned that she is naturally a more distant person. I agreed that I would try to accept that, and she agreed that she would try to be better about it. As the time went on things got worse as far as our affection/communication. The second time i brought it up to her. She said she didnt think she could provide what I need, and maybe we are better off ending the relationship. I told her I thought she was right for the sake of both of us.. I didnt want to add any unnecessary stress or make her feel obligated to attend to me. I felt that our communication on this was fine overall.. I never accused her of anything or got frustrated for not getting attention. I mentioned that it had bothered me.

I realized almost immediately after this that I was being irrational and that I had fucked up. I dont know what to say.. I freaked out because I didnt want to lose the first person in a long time that I was genuinely falling in love with.. My previous relationship, plus some abandonment issues from my childhood made me clingy in my opinion.. I fucked up.. Idk what to say.. Bit I do appreciate the insight that I was over reacting."
seduction,fqra784,t1_fqqurz9,1589580477.0,"I keep having this issue.. I spent years of my life alone.. And i spent that time building myself up emotionally, spiritually, physically, and financially.. I met someone and it was great for awhile.. I felt she was genuinely really into me and invested and I in turn started to reciprocate that. It ended recently and I am torn up because of it.. I keep asking myself why do i feel this way? I spend all of my free time doing things to improve myself in some way. I spent years alone, so i feel comfortable alone?

I think that it is ok to love yourself and feel comfortable alone, and still enjoy the company and attention of someone romantically.. I get where the idea comes from.. But it is also 100% natural and ok to want and enjoy romantic company also"

He basically told me that he not always agree with my decisions, but that he would always love me. And he is proud of the man I am becoming. Idk why he never gave it too me..

SeriousConversation,fpydj20,t3_gg6of8,1589001935.0,"Damn dude.. Currently going through something very similar.. Lots of deep seeded trust issues from a previous relationship.. Met someone who I wasn't just attracted to but really appreciated and respected. I let my past relationship get the best of me and slowly drove her away. I could see it.. But she wouldnt admit it and kept saying she was still into me. The last 2 weeks she became so distant I decided to end it for my own emotional health. The talk turned into her agreeing that this wasnt a good thing for either of us. So the break up became very emotional on both ends but was mutual. Because it was effecting me so negatively, also because it was effecting her because she did nothing to deserve the way I was acting.. Its been 4 days and I am a fucking wreck right now. I tried messaging her earlier asking to talk but she is ignoring me.. At the end of the day it is best for the both of us to just accept what happened and fix the root of the issue. Sounds like neither of our ex's did anything to deserve the distrust we put on them, and deserve a healthy relationship. I'm learning alot through this process and realizing how to handle this better in the future.

Also congrats on you man for realizing this at a young age.. Im 27 and still have these issues. Take care of it now while you can so that you dont waste your 20s living in self pity and wasting potential love like I have."
dating_advice,fpwepqp,t1_fpvl28t,1588962146.0,I hear you on that.. Do you think it could be better in person? Being able to actually develope that physical chemistry? We did hang out a handful of times before we cut it off and it felt right.. Idk maybe your right.. But even in virtual interactions i havent felt this connected to someone before. Maybe its because we both were putting in a fair amount of effort for it tho?

dating_advice,fpp59bn,t1_fpp1pwc,1588796196.0,"You are right.. When we first started dating she brought up the love languages and we went over what both of us want in one another. Hers was physical touch which I was dcared of because we couldnt spend time togwther during quarantine. Mine was words of affirmation, which she had told me wasnt her strong suite. 

I agree it needed to be done for the mental sake of both os us.. It was putting a strain on me emotionally, and in turn on her because i was being insecure or asking too much from her maybe.. Which in turn might just mean we wouldnt be a good fit for one another.. But still it sucks.

I think I'm going to give her some space for awhile until lockdown here is lifted. Then seeing if she is open to trying again and implimenting an idea like this. In the mean time i want to work on why I crave so much attention and intimacy."
relationship_advice,fpoot6j,t1_fpooj8z,1588788092.0,"As it stands we ended it.. Should I give her some space, then talk to her in the next couple of weeks and propose this? I really think the biggest strain on the relationship for me, was that I couldnt spend time in person with her. If our entire relationship is based on our communication through phone. Then the phone communication dries up I think it put a real strain on me."
dating_advice,fpb75un,t1_fpb6kgl,1588463544.0,Honestly.. Since posting this.. This is exactly what I had been thinking.. Even if i am overthinking or she is still invested.. This is having some serious negative effects on my mental and emotional health and I dont want to put myself through it anymore.. I had already talked to her about how it bothers me and she acknowledged it and hasnt made a change.. So next step for me is too at least out this on pause until we get to see eachother in person again
dating_advice,fpash2m,t1_fpas6dt,1588454774.0,I am also bordering on the feeling of what you say you reckon he felt.. Like initially it was so strong and intense I was invested so much.. Now that this has calmed down so much I keep second guessing my feelings or even want for commitment to someone.. Its a weird space of feeling like i need to break up with her because im not invested how I was initially.. And also feeling like I wish she would invest more and bring those feelings back for me
relationship_advice,fpas7cn,t1_fparmtk,1588454610.0,"I agree.. I kept telling her that.. Not to put pressure on her or anything. But just saying that I felt we need face to face interaction.. Not for sex but any sort of physical intimacy or something.. Her parents are very hard on her and are not really allowing her to leave .. Which also bothers me since she is a grown woman. But last time she got out to hang out for a little bit her mom called her yelling at her freaking out.. So I don't stress her trying to leave or anything. 

And i keep thinking about saying we should just stop until quarantine is over.. But at this point I am emotionally attached pretty hard and it hurts to not talk to her throughout the day.. Or feel like I cant call and enjoy talking to her"

Since then we are still talking and potentially pursuing a relationship. But anytime I start to second guess having a relationship with her i realize there are so many girls i know I could hook up with if I chose that route right now. And it makes the idea of this girl deciding she doesnt want to be with me so much easier then feeling like I need her validation."
relationship_advice,fno31nm,t1_fno2gwx,1587110236.0,"I guess.. But the intensity has changed so much.. First few weeks it was all her.. Constantly calling me.. And never wanting to hangup.. We got into the habit of her video calling me everynight and falling asleep together via video chat then waking up in the morning and talking sweet shit for a bit before we started our day. 

I just realized in the last few days I havent even heard much from her in regards to what she is doing, or how her days is going. Because our conversations and messages are so far apart, compared to what they were in tbe beginning."
relationship_advice,fno1xtw,t1_fno13xe,1587109110.0,"Honestly I agree with your last paragraph more then anything.. I thought I had gotten over this stuff and that I could handle another relationship.. But its obvious I cant.. I honestly tried to end it with her lastnight because of my insecurities and nothing else.. She told me she wanted to pursue a relationship with me and that she wanted to earn my trust and all kinds of sweet shit.. So I figured ok maybe I should stay in this because she really is willing to help me through this.. But I really dont think I can right now obviously.. I just dont know what to do to get over this issue..

On the other subject its hard for me to see her being distant or taking longer to reply because she is busy.. She is out of work right now, living at home with her parents.. And doesnt have much else to do. For the first few weeks of us talking it wasnt 5 minutes that went by where she wasnt texting me. I know she was constantly at home doing nothing. So for it to be very consistent that she takes hours to reply is notice of 1 of 2 things for me. Either she has lost interest in me alone, and is dragging me along, or someone else has taken her main spot of interest and she is dragging me along.

I get also what you say about her being able to like other peoples posts or pics etc. But she is doing it specifically on his, nobody elses.. And this is someone she told me she had hung out with a few times before me. 

At the end of the day you are right.. I shouldnt feel this way so soon, or even in general. Its something I hate and the main reason I feel I am not ready for this. It isnt fair to her either way.. Either im being insecure for no reason.. Or she did find someone else to show interest in, which honestly should be ok"
relationship_advice,fno0erx,t1_fno0975,1587107589.0,The distance thing happened before I brought up any insecurities about it..

I also feel like that is the best bet.. But personally it scares me. I have some issues from my last relationship which make me paranoid that she is going to move on etc. I know its noy the healthiest and we have also talked about that, to which she is really understanding. Honestly i feel she initiates 90% of communication and is always the one calling or video calling me.

hiphopheads,fcvnmfi,t1_fcuvjdb,1578005988.0,Never claimed they weren't.. Kind of weird everything has to be a rock vs rap conversation. Rock music 100% influenced people to try heroin and plenty of other bad habbits.
hiphopheads,fcvngzk,t1_fcuvn2x,1578005894.0,Ahh yes trap wizard is definetly the name of someone whose parents only allowed him too dabble in rap music.. Preventing them from idolizing illegal activities.
hiphopheads,fcuvexx,t1_fcuv1v9,1577989337.0,"The irony is that you vilified and glorified hip-hop at the same time.. Listen its just how it goes. We idolize people, then imitate their life. If your trying to tell me that my parents were bad parents because they let me listen to rap music in my spare time then why are you even here? Kids are young dumb and impressionable.. I literally just saw an interview with juice world where he says he 100% started using drugs at a young age because his idols rapped about it."
hiphopheads,fcumwq2,t1_fcul1cg,1577984429.0,100% it is.. At 12 years old would I have ever wanted to try lean if every rapper I listened too wasnt bragging about it on every song? Or smoke weed because of them? No.. Claiming that rappers promoting their drug habbits does not influence kids is simply ignorance.

hiphopheads,fa8ncy4,t1_fa7cg7h,1575850192.0,If only it were that easy.. But fr needs to happen.. That shit is real.. Ive watched a friend who used to be dissapointed at me for doing a line of cocaine at a party.. To straight up becoming a zombie off this shit and its all because of the music because it started once he started listening to this type of shit.
hiphopheads,fa7dohq,t1_fa7ci8f,1575833752.0,"As most and alot of people do.. But once people you know and went to school with start dying you start to appreciate life alot more trust me.. Same can be said for developing empathy for people you dont know. I remember a friend showing me videos online of people dying when I was around that age, and it was fucked up and I felt bad for them. But now it registers alot more too me where, I cant even try to watch something like that now."
hiphopheads,fa7bi6f,t1_fa79zes,1575833268.0,Thats probably why they lack empathy.. 21 is young af.. You still have so much time to grow and develope
hiphopheads,fa79v3n,t1_fa78e1k,1575832859.0,"Was must thinking about how sad it is that these kids are used by the industry like this. Look at peep, apparently his label would supply him with drugs etc. To carry on the image he had developed."
hiphopheads,fa75cbr,t1_fa740mn,1575831572.0,"Theres something weird about glorifying it.. Im listening to good bye and good riddance right now. Literally every song is about his drug problem. He recognized it and how dangerous it was. He is non stop talking about dyeing from his habbits. When you are really depressed you glorify death and a sad existence. For anyone who mentally feels broken they turn to artists like juice to relate. And though they know the problems they take the drugs to either escape, or in hopes that it kills them."

But man I am missing the pregame lobby. Loved being able to talk a bit before the game, view players records etc. That made that game so much fun for me."

I dont really care about holidays or thanksgiving, im kind of a humbug and anti social. But it was awesome to just have someone say something so meaningless. Made me really appreciate the holiday for what it is (at least according to our modern take on it) a celebration of friends and family."

AskReddit,f8ul0ng,t1_f8uku0c,1574833025.0,It is a great book. It is full of stuff we all intuitively know makes someone interesting or likeable. But i personally never had put much thought into consciously doing those things. Now I will catch myself in a certain situation and remind myself to do the things listed in the book.
AskReddit,f8ukk6d,t1_f8uiy9v,1574832553.0,Just finished reading how to win friends and influence people and that is one take away I got. I have been trying to smile at everyone but it feels forced and weird sometimes haha.. Does make me feel much better when i get a smile back though

Has your creative process improved since dropping those negatives?"
