starbucksbaristas,fr5gqt9,t1_fr5bjmn,1589908296.0,"This is simply not true. The genesis of the modern police in the south was literally Slave Patrol. Police did not arise alongside civilization, they were invented in the 1830s to police Black communities and stamp out sex workers - social policing, not crime. These origins do not just go away. Over 40% of police officers have a record of domestic abuse, there is no one holding them accountable. 

Over 2/3rds of the fired cops in my city has been rehired. 2/3rds. Not .1%. These are officers who have assaulted civilians, gotten multiple DWIs, domestic violence charges - all swept under the rug for our Boys in Blue. When I say I dislike cops its because they have chosen to be a part of that system. There are other mutual aid opportunities and ways in which you can help your community besides being a COP. As a Latina woman I feel uncomfortable around cops. ICE has a presence in my city. I went to a low income largely Black/Latino HS and saw hulking cops tackle and chokehold 16 year old kids on the concrete. So I hope yall can understand why some communities do not trust cops. They have never helped us."
