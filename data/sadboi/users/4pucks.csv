depression,fibniac,t3_f7gn3a,1582325803.0,"The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is my best friend. She said if I kill myself, she would probably end up doing the same thing and I feel guilty just thinking about how much I would hurt her. Try to find someone or something to live for, because I'm sure as hell not living for myself anymore. I believe in you. <3"
depression,fi444a1,t3_f5zfvl,1582133588.0,It makes me feel even more worthless and pathetic knowing that everyone around me is succeeding and I'm not even progressing. I'm only falling behind if anything.

depression,fhe2xid,t3_f2jde3,1581512087.0,"That's exactly how I feel! When I'm in a depressive episode, it gets bad, and I mean really bad. I have suicidal thoughts almost every day and I'm getting closer and closer to following through. Sometimes out of nowhere, I'll have an occasional good day and I'll feel guilty for even talking about my depression with others because it feels like I'm faking it and lying to myself and everyone around me. I thought I was the only one who experienced this, so I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one."
