depression,ewx412w,t3_cqd3ib,1565843609.0,"Hey! 

What's going on in your life? Why are you not happy?

I know what its like to be extremely lonely. Whats up?"
depression,ewv1esw,t1_ewu9a9p,1565796509.0,My cohost and I just talk about crazy news and events going on in the world and then BS about them and make jokes. Lol We have like close to 100 episodes now. They are way better than they used to be. They were trash when we first started lol. Now we have better equipment and better rapport and more of an idea wtf we are doing haha
depression,ewsoo4a,t1_ewslttz,1565731938.0,"Yeah, I agree. If I dont like ur personality its so hard for me to be attracted to you. Lol Yes the quirky things are usually what I end up loving about a person. I am a huge fan of anything weird, random, etc, so little quirks that make people unique are awesome. 

Thats awesome you guys are finally getting a chance to hangout. What sort of games do you like to play or what would you two play together? 

I am in Texas if ur curious. I am going to send you a msg with the info about our podcast so i dont blast it all over reddit. Lol

Are you into anything creative? Writing, art,  music, anything at all creative?"
depression,ewskain,t1_ewsikxq,1565729301.0,"Yes that is such a great way to put it!! I crave meaningful relationships, but I know now isnt the time. Holy shit, thats perfect. I can absolutely relate. Real relationships are where its at for me too. 

I know Im a different kind of dude cuz I prefer the real connection of intellectual, personality, sense of humor equal to mine. Not just ""Oh ur cute"". Looks fade, the non physical aspect of a person lasts forever. Stimulate my mind and you can win me over lol. 

I also agree, if someone is too eager, it turns me off too. Its that fine line of needing that instant click, and can that click devleop before you make me feel you already committed. Haha. 

What do you think? Any of that make sense to you?

Thats amazing you get to see your good friend! Im sure that will be awesome. You two going to do anything fun?

Myself, I record my podcast on Tuesdays with a good buddy of mine. We always have a blast. Its a good escape from the real world and we get to laugh and talk bullshit. Haha. :) 

What state are you from?"
depression,ewshoph,t1_ewsgcus,1565727789.0,"The fact that you just said you were scared  of having no one too made me feel some relief. I knew I wasnt the only one who felt that way, but its goos to see someone else write it out. 

Why do you think that you keep making date plans and cancelling? Are you afraid to give people the chance? 

I am doing pretty good, just fighting with my mind a little. At least I recognize it, but it doesnt make it hurt less ya know. How are u doing besides the obvious? 

Anything positive happen to you today? Even the littlest thing?"
depression,ewsh13x,t1_ewsfu6r,1565727410.0,"Bro, you shouldnt be anyones punching bag. Trust me, I put up with it way too long. I didnt even realize she was actually making me feel worse until I was away from her."
depression,ewsgw6w,t3_cpxlok,1565727332.0,"I 100% understand why you feel this way. But..

I think the hobby thing isnt so much to bring you happiness, but to help keep your mind occupied. Alot of times when Im feeling really bad, Ill do anything to get my mind on somethig else, so i dont think about how I feel. 

Just a different perspective"
depression,ewsfl7p,t3_cpsdge,1565726553.0,I hate that my own head can be my own worst enemy. That spiral is rough. I understand.
depression,ewsff3i,t3_cpx9t6,1565726447.0,"I read this. All of it. 

Its ok. It really is. 

Even if you feel you shouldnt be in a relationship right now, we all want to feel love and affection. Even if we know committing to another person isnt in our best interest.

I am going thru something similar, but I am so afraid of having no one, that i find myself constantly looking for someone, even though I know I should be working on  enjoying being by myself. Its a vicious cycle. 

You arent worthless, you are just going thru a tough time. Work on you, work on doing somethig that brings a smile to your face. Little by little it will help. Im here to chat if you want."
depression,ewse8ue,t3_cpy06p,1565725737.0,"Ive never thought about it like this before.

But we dont kow for certain thats the case. We can either just wait for something that may never happen, or just have as much fun as you can until you cant have fun any longer."
depression,ewse0qf,t1_ewscxjr,1565725601.0,Your fiancee shouldnt speak to you like that.
depression,ewsds0v,t3_cpu68d,1565725453.0,"My ex did this/does this. Actually my last 2 now that I think about it. Trust me as someone on the opposite end, its hard for us too. 

If you really want to not do that, you have figure out what is causing it. Wehether thats looking deep inside urself or help from another person. 

I know you can do this and develop great relationships! We all are capable of it, just harser for some than others."
depression,ewsdemt,t3_cpvwhh,1565725225.0,"Yes, its amazing the things we can push ourselves to do when we feel the way we feel inside. 

But that is the promise we have inside us. If we can do this, we can beat it and move forward.. one day. 

Like others have said, there are many who are was worse off. Be thankful you can push through and get up and get out."
depression,ewrzkg9,t1_ewrr0q3,1565717123.0,"Ive been there before. Just keep trying new things. Eventually something will spark you. I eventually found podcasting and it was the creative release I needed. I dont get tons of listens, but I made the show for mysself, not for anyone else. Its my therapeutic release"
depression,ewqqhjc,t3_cpli5n,1565674735.0,"Been here, I can relate. Ive lost weight and being able to find a few things i can try on makes a world of difference. Dont get discouraged. Its a long battle. If i can do it anyone can do it"

depression,ewqqb4u,t3_cpmtn4,1565674531.0,Age? Are you an adult? I enjoy talking too
depression,ewqq7sz,t3_cpn46e,1565674427.0,Ur very much not worthless. Go to hobby lobby or another craft store and buy an acrylic paint starter set and some canvas. Let ur emotions fuel ur hand and just paint. Anything. Trust me. Its a great release.
depression,ewqq2b1,t3_cpoa6t,1565674256.0,What do you want to do?
depression,ewqppml,t3_cpidz8,1565673866.0,"This is a great quote from the movie Garden State about home:

Andrew Largeman: You know that point in your life when you realize that the house that you grew up in isn't really your home anymore? All of the sudden even though you have some place where you can put your shit that idea of home is gone.

Sam: I still feel at home in my house.

Andrew Largeman: You'll see when you move out. It just sort of happens one day, one day and it's just gone. And you can never get it back. It's like you get homesick for a place that doesn't even exist. I don't know maybe it's like this rite of passage, you know. You won't have this feeling again until you create a new idea of home for yourself, you know, for your kids, for the family you start. It's like a cycle or something. I miss the idea of it. Maybe that's all family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place."
depression,ewqpkmj,t1_ewnu4rt,1565673716.0,"I agree with you when you do find that person it will be well worth the wait. I feel much better today. I knew what was going on last night.

I havent ever thought about how the things we see in others, they dont see in themselves and neither do we see what others see in us. Amazing revelation. How are you feeling tonight? Better I hope.. 

What is one great thing that happened in your day today?"
depression,ewqpegw,t1_ewoko2z,1565673528.0,Thank u!! :)
depression,ewqpdxk,t1_ewnud5k,1565673512.0,Awesome thank you
depression,ewnsckw,t3_cp7se6,1565588659.0,"You sound amazing. You talk about things you used to find worthwhile fish, music. Fashion, makeup,  etc. Thats ok if they dont do it for you anymore. There is a whole world of things to try and enjoy. 

I know what you are going thru is hard and I dont know you, but I know you will get thru this!

You can talk to me. Whats up?"
depression,ewnr21n,t3_cp4zoy,1565587235.0,I need a hug and have no one to hug. I should find a dog to hug! Great idea
