Lmfao and I know this might seem over the top because the teachers weren't intending to hurt my feelings that bad but they didn't know what I struggled with.

I suggest toning down with the harshness for when you become a teacher, I certainly do hope that you won't be talking to the students the way you talked to that parent.

Your intentions weren't wrong, sir, it was how you said it. And it might have also came out like an order, remember people don't like being told what to do. Especially a mother with her own child.

I don't know if you're a female but if you are one of them ones that don't feel nothing or do but have the magical pill strong enough to get rid of the pain instantly and for a long period of time.

However, if it happened only one time for OP, doesn't mean that it's not going to continue.

>that most women experience on a monthly basis and get through without issue

In all honesty, a lot of women suffer from this, even those without the medical condition. And a lot don't get through without an issue. Maybe these women you're talking about are on birth control and are skipping their periods or something."

You don't know her, only God knows if she's only put a snippet of the worst of her biological mam's actions here. You never know, it could be worse. And I'm sure you know we can all have parents that don't care about us or feel like they do but just show their affection differently, not realising that it's actually damaging us.

My point is...don't judge her because of how she thinks about her mother. You can't have an opinion on that because she's not your mother. You don't know what she has gone through. And yes, congrats to her ma for taking care of her since she was a baby, as a mother should! Just because her mother has done her duty, doesn't mean that she's obligated to receive OP's love.

Yes, we can have mothers that care for you. (Basically, help you survive.) And still treat you like you're worthless, a burden or even a mistake. 

>It sounds like you’re making up what ever you can to justify your horrible attitude and behavior, if your mother really is as horrible as you say it really sounds like you took after her.

How can you tell her that she's inherited her mother's horrible attitude?? So you agree that her mother is as bad as OP says she is because if you didn't then you wouldn't have said that. Meaning that you're only contradicting yourself and that nullifies the whole point of your comment🙄"

That maybe they don't have any access to bettering themselves...maybe they don't have the funds. Especially in the areas they're living in. What if they don't have any opportunities? There's even been a study done that you're most likely to not get hired unless you have a Caucasian name.

However, when you mentioned the success of Nigerians it makes me think otherwise. 

You're right, if Nigerian immigrants coming from hardships and probably nothing, can be successful by moving to a country like America and working hard then why can't the African Americans become the same. 

Then again, what if African Americans have the slave mentality. Which tbh, would make sense due to their history and everything they've been through. Mentally, they believe there's no point in trying because they're not going to get it anyways due to the colour of their skin. And this is what actually makes me feel like it's not their fault. And I say that only because of their history. Maybe it really is a mental thing. They genuinely feel like, regardless the effort they put in, they could ever be successful because they're black.
