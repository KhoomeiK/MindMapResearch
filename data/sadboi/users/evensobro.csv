I feel that these characters tend to evolve and learn more about themselves throughout the story. That way the I, as a writer, and the reader get to learn more about them too. Dave Lister from Red Dwarf comes to mind, Billy Pilgrim from Slaughterhouse Five is another.

Dave, after ending up on Mimas, just wants to go back home, but he also understands well that the possibility of him returning is low. When he wakes up Red Dwarf after everyone is dead, and he realises that he himself is going to die,  he more or less gives up all hope on life.

Billy just wants to escape the war zone, and doesn't particularly enjoy his time during the war at all. He believes that his fate is already decided and that there is nothing he can do about it, so he just goes along with it.

By the end of the story, both these characters have changed. Billy is a strange one here particularly because the end of his story is really just the beginning of the book, but the same idea stands."

At first, you can just try and replace I with he/she and see how it goes. It's also very interesting to just look at people and analyse them and describe them. Gotta be careful to try to not stare too much, or you could come across as a creep though, haha!

writing,fjgeypc,t3_fdan71,1583324491.0,"I haven't read the other comments on this thread yet, but I'll share my own experience so far since I also prefer writing in first person.

When I first started writing, most of the characters in my story were designed around the people that I knew in real life. The protagonist's voice was usually my own. I also wrote a lot of text that was based on interviews, so telling it in first person from my own point of view just made it read more natural. Then I also started writing a journal, except that I would write my own diary as if it was a novel.

Over time, I had built a strong habit of writing in first person. I recently started working on my first long-form fiction, and I'm writing it in third person, and having a little hard time. I feel like I am so attached to my protagonist emotionally that it is becoming hard for me to write other characters just as well in third person. In first person, it would be the protagonist who explores and tells the story of other characters from their point of view.

I understand that all I have to do is just describe characters in third person as I would have in first person, but just the lack of experience makes this a little bit challenging.

Despite that, I have to write this one in third person because the story is built around the idea that the characters have their individual lives and sometimes they do not share information with each other. I'm not sure if it's a great idea to let that make a large impact on the story, but I'm just trying it out."

&#x200B;

* **Monopoly Deal**: This is a card version of the famous monopoly game. It's much faster and unlike the board version, it's a strategy based game. You can come up with tons of strategy and change your gameplay depending on who you are playing with.
* **Taboo**: You pick roll a dice and get a colour assigned. You then pick cards of that colour and have to explain the word on the card to your team without using the next three words on that card that are forbidden.
* **Ticket to Ride**: You start with destination cards and have to build trains on a map and connect the locations on your card. If you successfully complete the first three cards, you can pick more. You can (different points) based on how many (and which) locations you connect, and also the longer the tracks the more bonus points you get.
* **Scotland Yard**: It's a board game where one player competes against a the rest. While the group has to guess the location of the hiding player on the board, the ""thief"" has to evade while disclosing their location every now and then.
* **Joking Hazard:** Sort of like the Cards Against Humanity, but inspired by the dark humour of Cyanide and Happiness comics. Every card is a snippet of a comic and you lay them down such that one player has to pick the best combination in each round and the winner gets a point.

&#x200B;

dating_advice,fg390ys,t3_ewgzys,1580474837.0,"I have been depressed and also gone through therapy so I feel qualified to answer this question.

In my experience, while companionship can sometimes help with depression, who you are with makes a lot of difference. Managing depression means managing and learning more about your emotions. The risk while dating as a depressed person is that of not being able to identify and manage those. The process of finding a partner comes with a flood of emotions, and possibility of a heartbreak.

My first therapist made recommended right off that bat that I should follow up on any romantic feelings. In my case, at least, that wasn't a very good idea. Feeling lonely and not prepared, I would date someone, suffer heartbreak, and feel even worse. All the work that I would have put over weeks managing my emotions would go down the toilet and I would have to start all over again.

The second therapist that I saw talked me through identifying what I was feeling and reason about them. That helped a lot!

&#x200B;

Edit:

Having said that, I don't believe that you shouldn't date if you are depressed. I think once you learn to manage your mental state, it can be a lot of fun and even helpful for your own sanity to go out and meet people.
