anyway, if youâ€™re going i hope you get to try the ff:
- baked ziti, fried chicken, and soft serve from buckyâ€™s
- tuna tostada, uni tostada, and cochinita pibil from la chinesca
- the burger steak with gravy and fries from beefier"
ptsd,f24shhx,t1_f21wgeh,1569959361.0,"yes! interpersonal relationships are so complicated and confusing! without meaning to i unconsciously extend my irrational fears to people who have done nothing to hurt me and have never proven themselves unreliable because of my experiences! 

yes, i confronted my assailant earlier this year, at first i was so relieved that it went well. similar to your experience, he took on responsibility for his actions against me, was very apologetic and even gave me some explanation from his end about why he might have done what he did. this was what i hoped for initially, for him to take on part of the burden that i had been carrying for more than a decade. 

but tbh right now i think the fact that it went so well coupled with our history just made it all the more confusing. he wasnâ€™t the monster/villain i had built him up in my mind, he had his own set of traumas that may have indirectly caused my assault. he was so human and vulnerable with me that i think it might have touched me in a way i didnâ€™t anticipate."
ptsd,f1zmsry,t3_db5jup,1569846040.0,"this post is so timely (for me, that is)

iâ€™ve been having dreams of my sexual assaulter for the past month. this is very unusual for me since i tend not to dream at all or if i do, i forget it by morning. but lately iâ€™ve been dreaming of him - not as a monster (the way iâ€™ve seen him for the past 11 years) but as a sweet boy/man who is kind and gentle with me. last night was especially jarring for me because it was nsfw and now i feel weird about it. 

i suppose itâ€™s stirring up all these dormant feelings. our past is tricky, he was my sort of great teenage love, he was my best friend, i looked up to him, i loved him, and i hated him. up until early this year, i never really understood what he saw me as, but now that thatâ€™s been resolved iâ€™ve been feeling like maybe i still have feelings for him? i donâ€™t really know. anyway, youâ€™re not alone in this. i, for one, am sort of going through something similar. wishing you the best."
survivorsofabuse,ez61zhu,t1_ez4gtum,1567708211.0,"i feel that, that in itself is a win. and i hope that you acknowledge it that way. iâ€™ve always felt that the first steps in the healing process are being able to realize that the ways we cope are unhealthy for us and considering seeing mental health professionals."
survivorsofabuse,ez1hnrq,t3_czsyov,1567648086.0,"iâ€™m so sorry you experienced that, the lessons society has drilled in us oftentimes keep us from what is good or healthy for us, and can keep people from empathizing. iâ€™m glad that youâ€™re better now. 

i agree, recovery IS a long process. it took me 10 years before i even hopped onto the wagon to healing. though i do hope that you get to do some therapy. i thought i could handle the aftershocks of my ordeal alone but i was wrong - i kept on feeding the wrong beliefs (ie it was my fault for allowing myself to be put in that position) and a therapist easily unwound these. it helped my recovery move along."
JapanTravel,eytg5xk,t3_cyo4fe,1567435694.0,"i didn't want to lug around my suitcase in the subway too (did that in seoul and regretted it!) anyway, you might have already checked it out, but i highly recommend taking the airport limousine bus from narita airport. it dropped us off a block or so away from our hotel and picked us up at the same spot - it was worth it since our hotel was near a drop off point.

on spots to check out, i recommend going around the omotesando area or ginza. i hear nakameguro is cool too but i didn't get to go when i was in tokyo.

hope this helps and that you enjoy your trip!"
ptsd,exuz2j9,t3_cu850e,1566590173.0,"i relate so hard to invalidating my own trauma, i often have to remind myself that what happened to me wasnâ€™t normal and that it shouldnâ€™t have happened in the first place because the default setting i always end up reverting to is that i should bury it deep and never deal with it. i did it for ten years, it just ended up rotting me inside out - hence my attacks and overloading my brain. whether or not it was my own doing because it was a natural course for me, or if i unconsciously did it because of what i internalized growing up, no one should have to deal with that. 

i suppose if anything, one of the greater lessons my experiences and living with ptsd has taught me is to be more mindful and awareness. mindful that somethings are unnatural experiences, awareness of consistently choosing to take the path of healing, recognizing the whole experience as other and not as something that defines me, and to keep speaking up, to keep encouraging people, to keep reminding them of things that i also remind myself of."

PTSDHumor,exjz5i8,t1_exjdi9b,1566365649.0,"hahaha for me, i usually get really overwhelmed when i fall into this strong current of bad memories and instead of pulling myself out of it my brain kind of fritzes out instead and reboots until i can function normally again. then about an hour or two later the whole thing happens again."
ptsd,exbrmx8,t3_cs0jz3,1566136850.0,"yes, definitely. 

iâ€™m not sure if it might work for everyone but i think some grounding techniques might come in useful for moments where you get stuck in a bad memory cycle. 

my therapist taught me to focus on the bridge of my glasses for ten deep breaths while repeating a word that calms me. 

hope this helps ðŸ˜Š"
ptsd,ewouqaz,t3_cn1cr1,1565627110.0,"for the past year iâ€™ve felt that the girl i once was is dead and i continue to mourn her death - and even more so for the past few months. i wish i was nicer to her. i wish i could hug her and tell her she doesnâ€™t have to go away, and that none of it was her fault, that she deserves love and happiness. but i canâ€™t, so i try to be nicer to myself now, for her. for the girl who started to fade away the day i was assaulted. 

but sometimes, when i loosen my hold around good company, when i laugh loud and hard, i start to feel like the old me, and it IS like hugging a good friend i hadnâ€™t seen in years. it gives me hope that one day, iâ€™ll find her again."
