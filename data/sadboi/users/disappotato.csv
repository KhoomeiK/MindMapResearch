Wellthatsucks,fqwf7n2,t1_fqwdpwh,1589702276.0,"Champ, you gotta understand not everyone is blessed to have a safe and happy family like us. There are people who are the soul breadwinners of the family, and then some one them also come from very toxic parents, who refuse to believe that this is a huge pandemic but instead blame the soul breadwinners that it's their fault  for not getting the family to be comfortable.

Then there's people who's family who didn't believe in mental health and then complain about how people with mental health issues are panicking ( Sounds very familiar)
In a whole there are people stuck in toxic environment and can't get out. There are people who have no money and are being pressured by bills, rent and cost of food. There are people who are claustrophobic who can't handle being stuck in a small place. There are people who if alone go into a spiral of depression as social connections keeps them going."
