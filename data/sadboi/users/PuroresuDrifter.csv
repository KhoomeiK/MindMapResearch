But the diagnosis is pretty quick, you‚Äôll most likely know you have it and be diagnosed pretty quickly. I was diagnosed my first appointment I had made with my therapist. The only reason I couldn‚Äôt get medication early on as well was because the psychiatrist‚Äôs office didn‚Äôt accept my insurance for medication management. Once you get the medication (from the therapist or your general practitioner because they could most likely diagnose you too) it really depends on which one you start with. I noticed immediate relief the first day I took Vyvanse but there are several different medications you could try if the first one you take doesn‚Äôt work and you could always increase the dosage but most meds work with the starting dosage. So to answer in short you can get there pretty quickly"

One of their slower songs off of their most recent full length album is a song that‚Äôs part of a three song series, each with their own chapter if you will (part 1 is The Sun, The Moon, The Truth, part 2 is The Inner Authority and part three is The Reach for Me: Forgiveness of Self. It features mostly clean singing from the vocalist Jesse Barnett who is a beast. The song touches on realizing the things that have harmed others to complete your own agenda. One line in the chorus goes something like ‚ÄúAnd if I can‚Äôt learn from what I‚Äôve done, the pain I‚Äôve felt has been for nothing‚Äù. There‚Äôs a couple other hard hitting lines in the song but that one speaks to me, along with a line in the opening verse that goes ‚ÄúI know the things I‚Äôve done, and most I‚Äôm proud but some I‚Äôm not, and it‚Äôs those that speak the loudest that replay and keep me up‚Äù. A lot of introspection on that record but that‚Äôs one that sticks out the most."

BPD,fo73uqh,t3_g60xws,1587571775.0,"I have this same problem too. I think it‚Äôs why I‚Äôve avoided relationships for so long because I always feel like the partner I find will always want to bring me out of my comfort zone which inevitably would be beneficial I know. The one thing I can say is that I have to challenge myself to literally do the opposite of what I‚Äôm doing. Sitting around listening to music? Do laundry while listening, clean my room/car, make to do lists, rearrange my room just something to train my mind to not always feel content with doing nothing."

Another thing is maturity, everyone thinks I‚Äôm far beyond my years in maturity and I feel like I have a really dark, weird sense of humor.

I won‚Äôt say the name but to get a cart at this place you have to put a quarter into the cart which unlocks it from all the others. Once you‚Äôre finished, you come back, reattach it to the chain and you get the quarter back. Now since most people who don‚Äôt get a cart want just a few items, they usually have a bag to put them in but to minimize the spread of germs cashiers aren‚Äôt really allowed to touch the customers bags anymore so people are being told to bring carts in so cashiers aren‚Äôt doing as much Hand to Hand contact. Not sure if it‚Äôs the same store haha, but just explaining why I know my store did it.

I also worked at the store i normally go to so I see some people I recognize which makes it quite weird but it‚Äôs been a few years so that‚Äôs good.

I also just fail to greet and make eye contact with people. That‚Äôs what upsets people the most honestly, because I guess as a cashier they expect the exact opposite of you.

Having AVPD is having a poor perception of yourself. You think you‚Äôre socially inept, you don‚Äôt view yourself worthy of anyone‚Äôs time and to me, it‚Äôs kinda like the aforementioned social anxiety but to an extreme. A person with AVPD will also most likely not seek out help while someone who has social anxiety will possibly be able to talk to someone about it, maybe get an SSRI"

‚ÄúCause I‚Äôve had days that I swore would be my last

Just to tiptoe towards the thought that maybe
someday I‚Äôd get back to who I used to be 
To what I used to see in the mirror

apathy, but I know eventually 
I‚Äôm gonna come around and maybe it won‚Äôt be

She would hang out with me a lot during the summer where we were out of school but as soon as it started again, she told me she didn‚Äôt want to be seen with me because I was too short for her. I appreciated her honesty and it didn‚Äôt make me like too incredibly sad, but I missed having someone to talk to. It made me think every other girl would feel the same as she did, so I stopped trying to initiate anything that resembled a relationship.

AvPD,fhrmi7o,t3_f4laq2,1581830595.0,"Yes, I very much am. 

I did amateur wrestling all through middle and high school. It can become very physical and competitive, two things I am not a fan of. Starting it wasn‚Äôt really on my accord, my dad it in school and he wanted me to try it too. He never pressured me too much about it, just that he wanted to see me succeed so that helped in giving it a shot. I ended up sticking with it until I graduated as I mentioned above. By nature I became fairly skilled at it, I won a handful of tournaments and it helped shape me as a man, to never complain, always give 100% and expect nothing in return while disciplining your mind to fight through adversity while being behind on a scorecard, literally and figuratively. 

Sadly I never had the ideal inner monologue of a wrestler. Many times I would defeat myself before I had even stepped out on the mat. I would often say to myself that I wasn‚Äôt good enough and that I was going to lose. This sport is based on being confident in your own abilities and using technique to outmaneuver another individual. There were times I lost matches, very high stakes matches that would determine my spot in a big event. I would suffer from this huge adrenaline dump where I felt like such a loser for not winning and as if I let the world down. 

I‚Äôve also had coaches yell very degrading insults at me and had them tell me I didn‚Äôt give it my all and that I simply gave up, when I knew that wasn‚Äôt the case. I wouldn‚Äôt trade the experience of wrestling for anything in the world because winning a match and having your hand raised in front of several people who appreciated your effort and your ability is an amazing feeling, but it also made me a people pleaser. It made me very conscious of how I would be evaluated by others and I‚Äôve probably done more harm to myself by pushing harder than my body wanted me to, solely guided by the fear of failure and letting others down."

I had a girl from my work who‚Äôs first day on the job was shadowing me and watching how I do everything to learn the job. All my coworkers wouldn‚Äôt stop bothering me about it‚Äî ‚Äúshe‚Äôs totally into you‚Äù and ‚Äúyou should ask her out, she wants you to‚Äù but it‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt see the conversations we had over text when she took hours, sometimes days to respond and the fact that she has five other close guy friends who I‚Äôve seen her flirt with in person. For me I knew she just wanted attention and she just wanted me there when it was good for her, not for me.

Metalcore,fhjtl1d,t3_f3ij82,1581655210.0,IT‚ÄôLL FEED YOU SHIT ‚ÄòTIL YOU BITE THE FUCKING HAND
lonely,fhj425x,t3_f3ccl8,1581637798.0,"Yeah I feel this too. It‚Äôs crazy how recently more and more of my friends are getting into relationships and I still don‚Äôt have one. Part of me thinks I‚Äôm not ready for one, but part of me also thinks it‚Äôs the one thing I really need"
BPD,fhdbspv,t3_f2gk2y,1581481913.0,"It‚Äôs definitely easier for me to degrade myself and put others above me and that‚Äôs what I think about when I think about apologies, so yes for sure. I also like you just don‚Äôt like confrontation so it‚Äôs easier to let them win and think I was in the wrong."
BPD,fha6jtd,t1_fha6h7e,1581398656.0,Yeah I‚Äôve been where I‚Äôve been for about two years. I guess I‚Äôm just afraid of change
BPD,fha670o,t1_fha6537,1581398357.0,Lol I appreciate that. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though each and every day I get closer to my wits end
BPD,fh8ws2t,t3_f1qk4r,1581368967.0,"Yes, yes and yes. I relate so much. I work in retail and sometimes its hard for me to make it through the day because of how inconsiderate and rude people truly are and I get set off by the smallest things"
AvPD,fh6rz4b,t1_fh6jn6b,1581304650.0,"I absolutely feel this way too. The few times I‚Äôve drank with friends they‚Äôve told me I was way more open than I ever have been. 

It also kind of made me realize that I am what I seek, the person who can go through life without these difficulties and that since I understand I shouldn‚Äôt seek who I am, because we all already have what it takes. Easier said than done obviously"
AvPD,fh6rt3e,t1_fh65vfd,1581304529.0,I definitely don‚Äôt want to develop a habit of it but I wish there was some key to unlock this feeling without alcohol
AvPD,fh6rp6t,t3_f1j07n,1581304453.0,"Fuck that was hard to read. That‚Äôs probably because I can relate to a lot of these feelings. The feeling of being drained, empty and devoid of any purpose in life. Sometimes it brings tears to my eyes knowing there are people out there who are in so much emotional and mental pain with seemingly no way out. 

I don‚Äôt have much advice to give. I‚Äôm going through a lot of these same struggles but my life seems to follow a pattern of peaks and valleys. I have great days where I‚Äôm on top of the earth and then I have others where I‚Äôm at absolute rock bottom. I‚Äôm struggling together with you man"
aspergers,fh303g7,t3_f12q9x,1581263080.0,"Absolutely agreed. I‚Äôve stopped commenting on the majority of the threads I lurk on, with the exception of this one and probably r/adhd_anxiety because it‚Äôs so toxic. I can‚Äôt even fathom why some people go to a subreddit they know nothing about and criticize the people that are on it"
AvPD,fh2r6xz,t1_fh2qrk4,1581259808.0,That‚Äôs good to hear. I‚Äôll keep the part about being open in mind
AvPD,fh2qg5b,t1_fh2mu24,1581259494.0,"So do you think I could get an anti-anxiety prescription without any diagnosis of an anxiety disorder? I‚Äôm like 99% sure I have SAD, I‚Äôve been going to a therapist who diagnosed me with ADHD which I definitely have as well as he knows I have anxiety too, but he just wrote me a recommendation for an ADHD medication from my normal doctor. When I go to my normal doctor, if I tell him about my anxiety could I get something for that too?"
AvPD,fh2jsee,t1_fh2jnrx,1581255353.0,"You‚Äôre exactly right. The one time I have gotten a drink at a bar, my friend who obviously isn‚Äôt bothered by this went up to get another so I went up him and got what he got so that helped a lot"
AvPD,fh2jgqx,t1_fh2jadk,1581255025.0,"Normally I drink alone. I‚Äôm not opposed to drinking with friends but I always try to drink at home, ordering drinks is really stressful for me. I never know what to get, I usually have one kind of drink I really like and it‚Äôs not a local one or anything so no taproom is going to have it. Also I‚Äôm 21 but I definitely don‚Äôt look it so I feel like people stare at me like ‚Äúwhoa kid what are you doing‚Äù which sounds silly because they‚Äôre probably not but I still have the fear"
AvPD,fh1xbg7,t1_fh1x9o1,1581227124.0,Lol no I haven‚Äôt but I‚Äôm sure it would have a nice effect
aspergers,fgypncd,t1_fgxwmbo,1581185610.0,Very true
aspergers,fgv7oh8,t1_fgv7lf7,1581139644.0,Oh yeah Ashe O‚ÄôHara is a beast. He‚Äôs a perfect fit for the ambience of the record.
aspergers,fgv50x5,t1_fgv3ew1,1581137328.0,"I get that. I guess at that point it becomes me questioning what‚Äôs creepy vs. what isn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt think it was creepy, she had mentioned it to me before and I thought it would show her I was paying attention to our conversation."
aspergers,fgv4qy0,t1_fgv4pgp,1581137097.0,Yeah I can strongly relate to that too
aspergers,fgv2k4k,t1_fgv2hxw,1581135337.0,That actually seems like a really effective strategy.
AvPD,fgv09k4,t3_f0kt1s,1581133575.0,"Yes I am very much this way. A big stressor I think comes from not being able to maintain eye contact very well. If I‚Äôm in a group, I can glance at everyone for a split second without having to look at anyone for too long. I relate to the part about the stakes being higher as well, if I‚Äôm in a group there‚Äôs a good chance someone else will talk instead of me so I can just go off what they say and chime in but it‚Äôs like the attention is magnified one-on-one"
aspergers,fgupk3e,t1_fgup7d7,1581126455.0,"Some of my favorites include Volumes, The Contortionist, After the Burial, TesseracT and some debate them not being prog but I think August Burns Red has several prog songs. 

I also checked out a sub genre called mathcore and oh man. I listened to a band called Car Bomb. Imagine having your ears get hit with gravel being propelled by the speed of a jet plane engine. The time signatures are crazy odd but I loved it"
aspergers,fgulb98,t3_f0ipa9,1581123656.0,"Yes! I‚Äôm hugely into metalcore, progressive metal, hardcore and pop punk music and even deathcore at times. I always want to learn the band members and their names, and the history of the band itself"
aspergers,fgubb99,t3_f0fktl,1581116690.0,"Most of the time it‚Äôs a negative perception. I see a person who is afraid of the future, a person who fears he‚Äôll never have what it takes to have a significant other and a person who doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with him. 

Sometimes I think I‚Äôm autistic, other times I think I have some personality disorder. But I undoubtedly have identity issues and I can‚Äôt silence all these questions."
lonely,fguaq3h,t3_f0gied,1581116297.0,"I‚Äôm not sure if there is an actual statistic for the average number of friends a person has, but I have three close ones who I‚Äôve known since fourth grade and we are all now 21. 

At the same time, only one of those friends knows the real me, all the things that effect me mostly because him and I are so similar."
AvPD,fgu9h7k,t1_fgt2bi9,1581115480.0,Yeah this is true
AvPD,fgsyywt,t1_fgrvsg0,1581095575.0,"I know, I know it sounds like I‚Äôm overreacting. I‚Äôve just had so many instances recently where someone literally insults me and they have no clue how hard it hits me and how much it effects me."
aspergers,fgr468a,t1_fgpi0aw,1581037740.0,"As I mentioned above, time passes on and a move from my small town to a bigger city alone entices me more and more every day. I think it would really get my life back on track."
aspergers,fgr3o76,t1_fgoipb9,1581037416.0,"Sometimes I really think it‚Äôs what I need to bring positive change to my life for once. A place where I don‚Äôt know anyone so I don‚Äôt have to worry about what they think. I guess I fear of breaking routine and spontaneity, along with being ADHD  makes it hard to go and do it."
BPD,fgnvx3h,t1_fgnvigt,1580954053.0,It‚Äôs good to hear that they can still work out
