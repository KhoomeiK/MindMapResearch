I told him yesterday it's time to go our separate ways and even then he was telling me all this stuff about how he misses me but is worried we will end up toxic if we get back together blah blah. He's trying to keep me as an option and every time I push away to let go he holds on hoping. I get close and he says no. Wants to be alone. It's toxic and you deserve better. Stay away from those kinds of people. They don't have your best interest in mind.

The comments about your family not knowing what to say could also be them protecting your sister from being revealed and ostricised.

However, what you are doing to your parents is kind of blackmail and slightly abusive. They are their own people and can make their own choices. It is still their child. You are controlling them and who they can and can't see. I'm really sorry to word it like this because I understand this is an incredibly complex situation but it's so clear from their reaction that they don't like or want to follow through with these requests but feel guilted into it.

I would strongly suggest you consider the idea of ex communication for now. I think you need to think about your level of acceptance and comfort and what you are comfortable with, but you cannot force your comfort onto others. What your sister did to you was horrific and I am sorry - but your parents are their own people and are allowed to make their own choices. If you're not comfortable with their choices you need to re-evaluate your relationship with them and if you feel comfortable being around them or if you need more space from them and time away"

You're not an asshole for wanting to go to sleep or not reply to someone just yet.
