Last week in Iraq, American armed forces killed Iran's General Soleimani. As General Soleimani was a figure who had very important jobs in areas like the army and diplomacy, he was very popular with the citizens.

In Tehran, Iran on the 6th, there was a funeral for the General. A huge crowd of people gathered, and figures like the country's supreme leader Khamenei and President Rouhani were in attendance. When Khamenei cried while praying, many people cried together.

Khamenei said that they were going get their revenge on America.

America's President Trump said that they did not kill in order to start a war. However, he has said that from this point on America has sent around 3000 troops to the Middle East.

The UN's Secretary-General Guterres said that tensions in the Middle East in the 21st century have become higher than ever."

depression,fa05glo,t3_e7g750,1575749200.0,"You're valid for feeling this way! Whether you want to express yourself as a more feminine cis man or a trans woman/nonbinary person, that's fine!! You'd be surprised, though, there are many trans girls that are around your height and weight that transition medically and socially who are seen as women by many people. And if not? That self-acceptance comes with time. Whether you decide to do hormones or just be more feminine as a man, that's fine. You have every right to take up the space and time you need to figure out yourself. You may have gone through some trauma for being sensitive and feminine, and that might by why you feel flawed in accepting it, and that's ok! It's hard to accept, but being sensitive, kind, and feminine is nothing to be ashamed of, no matter what your gender. <3 :) I get it, I was really confused about my gender for a while (and still am!!), and even though I ended up being NB, my journey and a lot of other people's aren't over, and that's ok, too! Just take it slow and explore little by little everything you want to try, without self-judgement :) Just go with what you're gravitated toward, even if it's scary :)"

You shouldn't be discouraged if the sound you want comes from presets, especially since a lot of music on the radio can have presets in it! If presets were cheating, then where do you draw the line? Would using recorded drums be cheating? Would using any VSTs be cheating?? If it's mixed well , sounds good and most importantly, you like how it sounds, don't worry about whether or not people hear it in your music :)"

ask_transgender,f8pqw7t,t3_e1fnk4,1574705870.0,"Tbh, I'm NB so my experiences are probably different, but equally frustrating. It ranges from just feeling like something is socially wrong to feeling utter despair and wanting to claw off parts that make you uncomfortable. Since I don't want to be a woman or a man, and I don't know what I want exactly, it makes the feeling of discomfort even more frustrating since I don't know how to fix it. It's like looking in the mirror and seeing someone else do exactly what you do. It's not just the physical aspect, but it's also the social that makes it bad. Since business clothes that are usually strictly gendered give me bad physical and social dysphoria, I haven't been able to network. My friend said they couldn't go into business like they wanted to because of how badly the gender roles made them feel. I can't wear the skirts and feminine clothes I want without feeling like a hulking man. It's seeing yourself in pictures and wishing you did something to fix it earlier. It's shaving and going into a depression for hours instead of doing anything productive, only to repeat the cycle every morning. I knew something was wrong, but I thought at first I was a gay man. Now I know that that's not true, but male puberty has kinda fucked me over a bit in terms of reversing that. I don't know if I want to go through with hormones since it'll change everything. It's not just the physical discomfort with your body, but the weighing of pursuing who you really are vs. keeping what little equilibrium you have. I don't speak for everyone when I say this, but I think it's just as much a problem of being born in the wrong society as it is being born in the wrong body. Sorry for such a lengthy explanation!"

It really is heartbreaking, but like many other people say, you're probably not stupid. I'm depressed (diagnosed) and people say that I'm smart, yet I don't see it myself. Personally I do think I've gotten objectively stupider, but honestly that could be because of the depression. I'd say try taking it day by day and learning at least one new thing in subjects you find interesting, whether it be from your degree or not. Studying more languages has made me feel better about myself! Don't give up :)"
makinghiphop,f7y0sh3,t1_f7xgtn6,1574082986.0,"Sure, thanks for the feedback! I think the mixing on the melody sounds pretty clean, but overall it feels like it's missing something. I know it's probably intentional, but for me the 808 feels a bit too high pitched- it might sound better either the octave down or just in a lower key. Since the beat is pretty repetitive, it might be better to switch up some of the percussion or put on a lowpass filter or something, or even switch up the 808 pattern. It's catchy, but after a while the repetition is a little too much. I do like the drum pattern, though! Overall it's pretty good, but I think you need to spice it up a bit more with maybe some panned percs, 808 variations, and/or maybe a counter melody?"

After college, you can get a job, move to a new city, and find your way doing all sorts of things you couldn't do before. It sucks now, but it doesn't mean it'll feel that way forever. And, no matter what, don't give up on music! You can definitely do it even as a lucrative side thing if it makes you happy. A lot of people don't even have that one thing to make them happy, so if you really love it you should keep at it. Don't minimize your struggles either- the mind is a weird thing, and I know that a lot of people would like to be in my shoes too, but we just can't emotionally realize that/it makes us feel more guilty and sad.

I'm a Masters student, and I'm actually going into the field of language!

I think my issue was consistency and not having a base of really loving myself unconditionally. I just feel like it's super hard, especially being trans and not knowing what I want to do with my transition. But I know that it's really fucking hard for everyone!!

overcoming,ezx6dgh,t3_d2s3i8,1568233078.0,"I completely feel you. The only difference is, I'm in college. What I've realized now is that no matter what we think ourselves, you're not a worthless piece of trash. I did the same things as you- I isolated myself, I only did homework or went to bed, and my grades started struggling when I took STEM courses. Your grades don't define you, especially since it's high school! Whether you want to go to college or not, your grades are not the end-all-be-all of your worth as a human being. I was also a ""gifted kid"", and what many people don't tell you is that it can be extremely hard to deal with the expectations that go along with that, whether they be self-imposed or societal. My twin brother is basically going to become a doctor while I still don't know what I want to do with my life. But, we can't compare ourselves to others and put ourselves down. Your journey is different from everyone else's, and it's just beginning! High school may seem like the end of the world (it was for me), but you just need to keep everything in perspective. Something that helped me a lot is a gratitude journal. I kept a journal of feelings, wrote down what was good that happened to me, and 2 things that are good in my life/that I'm grateful for. Also, you should try and get out of a pattern of self-isolation. It may seem like it's better than talking to others, but it's not healthy. Your life is worth living, and you deserve to share it with others. You don't need to cure cancer or be an astrophysicist to be proud of yourself. You may not be where you want to be right now, but that doesn't mean that you're a piece of trash. There are plenty of people out here like you, and we're all rooting for you!"
