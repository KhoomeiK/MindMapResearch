misophonia,ffgt5fi,t3_etfmyv,1579914403.0,I had my therapist write a letter to my school‚Äôs testing accommodations department (where students granted extra time and such get sent) as well as my professor. They worked something out for me and I was able to test in a private room. Hope this helps!

misophonia,f9m8d8l,t3_e5rlga,1575445920.0,Dude no way!!! I have the same thing as a trigger. I used to only have sounds and then over time my mom sticking her tongue out often (she does it like every five minutes) started to bother me. Now it‚Äôs a full on trigger and even when other people do it I get annoyed. Thanksgiving was a nightmare this year. How are you holding up?
misophonia,f9j8dth,t3_e5d5db,1575360821.0,"There‚Äôs a few decent articles and studies out now (one on NPR) and usually I send people I‚Äôm close to some articles and other information about misophonia. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with that though it‚Äôs such a pain! Took me about 8 years to get my parents on board. After my parents realized it was real I really just started owning it. It‚Äôs tough and I‚Äôve gotten with in fights with friends over it but the people that deserve you will eventually be sympathetic and want you to get better.

Best way I usually explain it to people is it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre getting smacked across the face every time you hear or see one of your triggers."
selfharm,f9ffk0y,t3_e4rnlt,1575269682.0,"I don‚Äôt even know you but I f*cking love you. It‚Äôs tough to be at that point where even self harm doesn‚Äôt help and you feel like your only outlet is other self destructive behavior. 

The terrible thing about mental illness is that in most cases it will get worse and sometimes severely worse before it gets better. It‚Äôs like a slingshot and it keeps pulling you back further and further and you get to a point where you feel like the band is going to break. A lot of people (myself included for a while) do break and end up further in the abyss, or even committing suicide. But you‚Äôre strong and if you can keep hanging on day by day without drugs, eventually things will start to turn around. After a while you may even realize you know longer need to self harm and you‚Äôll be happy with your life again, whatever the situation was that was keeping you down previously. Life can only throw so much bad at you before you get hit by something great and the sun starts to shine. What you‚Äôre going through is the worst so be proud of yourself for having the courage to voice how you‚Äôre feeling because reaching out to others for help and support, even if anonymously, is often the hardest part.

Hang in there and PM me any time because no one deserves to be in that kind of situation and especially not alone."
