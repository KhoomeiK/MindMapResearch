I don't have one myself, and i'm not sure how it stacks up hardware-wise, but maybe it's worth it to get a new tablet like that amazon fire 7? CAD it's on sale for around $60-70 iirc, and to remove the ads if they bug you, either pay $15, or root it with a custom rom. I also hear you can call and say you're concerned about the types of ads they're showing to your child and they'll remove it for free. I never owned a 2nd gen nexus 7, but judging by how poorly my 1st gen aged with the nand degradation issue, that'd be the move for me."
