my grandmother would turn off the heater in the winter so it felt like your sleeping outside in the cold with a blanket over your body. I never wanted to get out of bed in the morning in the winter to go get dressed for school. imagine sleeping out in 45 degree weather in the winter time with nothing but a blanket covering you.

In the summertime, she would turn off the air conditioner and the thermostat was 110 degrees in the house, she would open all the windows and turn on all the fans that blow hot air....I could never get any sleep in the summertime.....because it was so hot....and I can barely think straight.

in the bathroom their were 4 electrical sockets for light bulbs......she took out 3 light bulbs and only left 1.

she would couple all the laundry in 1 wash regardless of color, so my black clothes all faded out and had pink stains on them.

I never got 3 square meals consistently.........i was once institutionalized in a mental facility and I did not want to leave because the people at the institution took better care of me by giving me 3 full square meals.

I could never focus in school was always tired, and hungry........got poor grades in school.

Would eat the same nasty crap food over and over again.....the only luxury was you get fast food from mcdonalds or taco bell every now and then.......

doctor complained that I was under weight for my height and age........skin and bones......

no family vacations, and no excessive shopping sprees for clothes. My mother and father were both out of the picture.....born out of wedlock.....dad never get any money for child support to my mother or grandmother to care for me. My mother was very irresponsible. Never saw much of her my grandmother decided to care for me because my mother was incapable of doing so."

exchristian,ey2fuod,t3_c4xzx2,1566738209.0,"its a cult. I was a part of the church of christ for many years, if you left the church to go to a different church outside of a church of christ they instantly treated you badly and cut you off completely.

&#x200B;

their isn't much of a difference between many churches.......I have met different church members through college and if you left their church they don't do that type of stuff they still talk to you like normal people because they are actually trying to be your friend.

&#x200B;

thats what these low lives do. they are not your real friends, they are here for your money. when they all cut you off that goes to show you that the friendships you had with these people were not real friendships.

&#x200B;

i have not gone back to church for 6 plus years.......and honestly they did not rape me, but they mentally damaged me to the point where its on the same level as being a boy molested in the catholic church.

so if you get married young that was an acceptable norm in the church in the 1700s,

they took our belongings and threw us off the church property when they had several empty bedrooms to spare.......all the excuses in the world when you put them to the test.
