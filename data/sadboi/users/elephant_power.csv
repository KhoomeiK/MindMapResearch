schizoaffective,f37khwr,t3_dfohgv,1570726994.0,"I currently work as an elementary school teacher. I see 150 different kids everyday: kids who come from challenged homes. I have a husband, 5 children, 2 Masters Degrees and a PhD. I teach part-time at the local university.

My work is challenging but rewarding. I approach everything with a peaceful demeanor. I know how intense things can get as stress is a trigger for me. I take my meds but I still have symptoms that break through.

It's not easy but it is possible to lead a full life. Know your limitations though. Be in-tune with yourself enough to identify when the world is getting Topsy-Turvy.

I hope thus helps."
