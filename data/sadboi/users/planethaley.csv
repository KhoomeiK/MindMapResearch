As for advice, sometimes you have to fake it until you make it; just pretend to know a little more than you do or to be a little happier than you really are and soon it hopefully pays off in some way or becomes true :)

And if you haven’t already, you should definitely update your resume. Even if you aren’t fired, it is always a good idea to have a current resume. I actually have a little experience with helping people write/update their resumes, so if you’re interested, I’d totally be willing to help you update your resume (Obviously, you should remove any personal details or locations specific stuff prior to sending it to me and send it in a DM).
