Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul CONSTANTLY follow the [Rule of Cool](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool) though. Gus Fring being able to walk with half his brain being blown out along with the Walt & Tuco fuliminated mercury explosion with no one dying  are other examples. The Rule of Cool is the limit of the Willing Suspension of Disbelief for a given element is directly proportional to its awesomeness."

Good lord almighty how did Fergie ever get to be an artist she can NOT sing to save her life its the most whiny annoying voice I have ever heard and she nearly ruins All of The Lights.
AskReddit,fr3ydrn,t3_gmdla7,1589869848.0,I was in an all-day class in a vo-tech highschool about 7 hours a day. My teacher would play the radio for us while we worked and every single time Judah & the Lion - Take It All Back would come on SOMEONE would always beg the teacher to please switch the station. Its the same lyrics over and over over and over again. Same thing would happen with Heathens by 21 Pilots.

metroidvania,fr03p6c,t3_gkr254,1589782808.0,"I am pretty new to Metroidvanias. I started recently with Hollow Knight, and then onto Ori 1, and I'm near finishing Ori: Will of the Wisp. As much as I loved Hollow Knight I liked Ori 2 more. Will of the Wisps is entirely fun from start to finish(so far, but I'm at 93% completion) There is not a single frustrating moment in the entire game while also not being too easy. They took a lot of cues from Hollow Knight (map sellers, charms, and having many different abilities) I am so looking forward to 100%ing every area in this game. Ori 1 is a lot of fun too, and I recommend playing Ori 1 first, but its also a much shorter game and 2 is MILES better. I am really looking forward to playing it again in a year or so when I forget a lot of what happens.

All of these I've got on xbox game pass, so while I still have it I just now have downloaded both The Messenger, and Yoku's Island Express. Yoku's Island being more of a pinball game seems like a very interesting idea I'm interested in seeing how that works. Planning on playing some emulated actual Metroid or Castlevania games once I run out of other ones or if there isn't a sale in a while.

edit: Oh and I've played Gato Roboto inbetween Ori 1 and 2. The game isn't forgettable it's just very short!"
