Anxiety,fkwaee7,t3_fl1gng,1584587267.0,"Are you able to see a therapist to talk through your feelings, especially about your relationship with your mom and perfectionism/control?

When I was first ""adulting"" and getting my first job, etc., I went through a lot of anxiety with separating from my mom. I did not realize at the time just how controlling she was, and how that in turn affected my confidence to ""launch"" my own life. I worked through it with a therapist, and it helped a lot. I also worked with a psychiatrist at the time, and that helped, too. 

The workplace can be weird. I've had many jobs, and have heard about as many critical things said to me as praise. Take it all with a grain of salt, since most of what people say is more about where they're at, not you. A good manager can get the best out of you while being honest about your performance, but they are very hard to come by. And, it's OK to suck at a job or just not be in the right position....you are more than your job at any particular moment in time.

I also talked to my doctor (several times) and confirmed that my heart rate was within the norm. While it is probably anxiety, it can be helpful to check with a health care provider so you can understand better what you're experiencing."

[ommeditation.org](https://ommeditation.org) 

ask your doc for an EKG so you can see the evidence of your health?

increase your daily intake of CBD? look into additional supplements that can support your nervous system?

appreciate all the good qualities that come with being sensitive such as empathy, generosity, good listening skills, attunement to God/spirituality?"
Anxiety,fkw33mb,t1_fkrw9c7,1584582365.0,Same here. Feels more intense when I lay down. Try to get my mind off it and do something distracting. Also listening to SMR when I go to sleep.
