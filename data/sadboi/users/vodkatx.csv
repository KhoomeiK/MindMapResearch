Cetaphil gentle cleanser,
Superdrug's vitamin c serum,
Garnier rose moisturiser.

I don't want a complicated, lengthy, expensive routine. I just want some help finding a good cleanser, I've used a few things, ones coming to mind are CeraVe hydrating and foaming cleansers, they made me extra oily and spotty and I'm currently using Cetaphil which is making me break out."
