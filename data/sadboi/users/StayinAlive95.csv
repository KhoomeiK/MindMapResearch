Tarotpractices,fl0a71w,t3_fefzii,1584698452.0,"Princess Yue of the Northern Water Tribe, in Avatar: the Last Airbender. She literally sacrifices her life in order to take the place of the felled moon spirit and that just speaks so strongly of her nurturing and caring nature that she did so- especially when she had just found a loving partner. It really seemed a very High Priestess like energy."
Tarotpractices,fl09znk,t3_fkyomy,1584698182.0,"I feel like the person first had a real change in value-systems and attitudes in terms of how they felt about women in general. Like, perhaps there was a very unilateral or dualistic view on a woman in a relationship. Either it could be a very smothering, Mother complex gone wrong that made the person think of (I'm assuming)any potential female partner as another controlling, emasculating authority. Or it could be that there was no engagement at all and this made the person construct or even compensate for that lack in their romantic relationships. (The Tower). So this Tower energy perhaps led them to really tap into their internal Empress, their Divine Feminine and be more receptive to different forms of feminity and generally soften up more. And finally, the two of cups may either mean on an internal level, rhat the person is healing and engaging with their feminine side and or that this is causing them to truly have a symbiotic relationship with their lady in question."
Tarotpractices,fl09nhy,t3_fjoiet,1584697738.0,"My first thoughts about the card is that it represents the Divine Feminine, the Divine Mother. I think of the imagery on the card, which is of a woman standing in a field of swaying, ripe corn and may be pregnant and looking onto the surroundings with calm pride. I get a very positive warm feeling on interacting with this card. Like if I go to them with a problem, they're not going to make me think of concrete solutions and look at it logically (like say the Emperor or even the Hierophant/High Priest may do)but just encourage me to take care of myself, my body and just be receptive to solutions rather than really exert force to do it. I associate the card with Demeter and it makes me think about how people tend to really take them for granted because there is no explicit, overt power or societal value in feminine traits per se, but then when Persephone was stolen away by Hades, Demeter refused her life giving power to the earth and the whole planet just crumbled. So my intuition is just that I do not want to make this person mad no matter how chill they seem lol"

Hi, I'm Devanjali and I'm looking for a buddy, time zone GMT+5:30.
So, I've been dabbling with the Tarot since I was around 13 years old and now at 24 I've been wanting to really level up and take it to a level where I don't feel the need to consult Tarot dictionaries in order to bolster my interpretations. I would love to have someone to inspire me and hold me accountable to my practice and would hope to do the same for them.
I'm a Hindu Brahmin by birth, but I follow the tenets of Zen Buddhism. I'm also deeply intrigued by Jungian depth psychology and often view the Tarot (especially the Major Arcana)as a collection of archetypes and readings as a mirror into one's unconscious mind. My other interests include comparitive mythology, painting, sketching and writing."

indianpeoplequora,fizhbn8,t1_fivom9y,1582862828.0,"Clarification: this was more about the basics of legislative drafting than contracts per se. There are some common things to keep in mind for nearly all legal instruments, hence."
indianpeoplequora,fizgx9b,t1_fivom9y,1582862528.0,"Not at all.  This is pretty technical and boring, so I don't blame you. Mostly, there is no definition of terms. If you ever look at any legislation, especially the more technical ones, a Section 2 (or article 2), is designated as a definitional clause which will outline the contextual definitions for terms as per the Act. Like you'll have entire cases based on the interpretation of just one word. So there is no definititon of 'hygiene'. So if for one partner, hygiene is bathing once a month and for another it's everyday, whose definition do you go with? Forget about common sense for a second, because shit has to be absolutely clear and transparent, so every single comma, word and conjunction is important. So, like in some of the 'terms', this dude is like 'you can terminate the contract one month prior'. Prior to what period? No specifics. 
Also other stuff like, there is no use of ""shall"", which implies a strict mandate but a ""will"", so can be argued that there was no strict bar on a certain action. Another thing, no court of any particular jurisdiction was referred to in case of dispute. 
Moreover, terms and conditions are mostly for interactions relating to sale of goods and operation of appliances etc. A pre-nuptial agreement would be a better format for such an inane agreement (also you don't actually need a written agreement to have a contract but here we are.)"

DecidingToBeBetter,fej8irb,t3_epcysa,1579161478.0,"I dated a guy for nearly 4 years. We'd taken a couple of trips together and the year we broke up, we got us tickets to watch our favorite artist in Bombay for Valentine's Day. But my mental health was deteriorating a fair bit at the time and we were both in this bubble which was becoming toxic for us both but we couldn't see it. We'd distanced ourselves from almost all of our friends and I had to redo another year of college (but that's not relevant- just giving you an idea of all the emotional ruin that it was wrecking). But that was 2017 and I've moved on a lot since then- both in terms of my mental health and co-dependency issues. 
I will say that the two were more closely related than I realised. Getting busy consciously (and not doing stupid shit with the intention of just distracting myself) with things like working on myself and things I liked but just didn't work on because of everything else I had on - reading, painting/sketching/art-ing as I call it lol, writing, chilling with my family and animals etc really really helped. My therapist was instrumental really.  So essentially, behavioral activation and CBD went a long way. And just the acceptance that ok, shit might be fucked right now but your thoughts are just suggestions and they're not immutable facts about where or who you are right now. 
Good luck! :D"

Like I felt (and still feel) that I have very few friends but then I realised that I have insanely high standards for friends. Also I quit a lot of vices in the past year- weed and cigarettes so i can relate in terms of the void. And I can also feel you about losing people because of that- I'm not using the word friend because I agree with you on hanging with people 'cause of the stoner link-but then personally speaking, I realised that I genuinely don't like being around people. I think when I was hanging out with people 24.7, I felt even more alone- like taking an open book test and scoring a zero: I had all the answers and tools in front of me and yet i wasn't able to find them. I'm not going to assume that your makeup is like mine but what I will say is that try developing your own tastes, interests and needs- again for me, I became very interested in Jungian depth psychology, Buddhism and mythology because I'm a strange fuck like that lol- but gonna go super Mr. Miyagi here and say that you need to truly find yourself before you can find your friends.

DecidingToBeBetter,fbj64tb,t3_edeeh8,1576925727.0,"I wish you the very very best. I took a year off from law school (although at the time I thought I was dropping out) because my MDD (major depressive disorder) turned into soft bipolar because I was medicating with weed and alcohol so much. I then went on to have at least two manic episodes and (Trigger warning) a bunch of experimental treatments including TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation)and finally 7 rounds of ECT. All this because I went into something of an emotionally catatonic state- I felt like a prisoner in my own head. Like I wanted to speak but felt like I couldn't/shouldn't. I didn't leave my room, much less my room in nearly 8 months.
Anyway I'm sorry for digressing so much and relating my story when we're all trying to help you here, but my point is that now I'm back in law school. I finished an entire missed semester in one month and took my exams and almost all the complexes I had- while not completely gone, are way more manageable.
TL;DR - In the recovery phase (and there is no standard on how long or short it is), please don't put the pressure of a having the 'perfect' comeback story or linear healing (as I thought lol)- just aim at being functional. That's it. I apologise if this triggered you in any way.

DecidingToBeBetter,etkw5yl,t3_cbywpp,1562910905.0,"I'm in a somewhat similar space although I cannot even pretend to understand what you've been through. I have bipolar 2 and a couple of my manic episodes made me do a lot of things I'm ashamed of- the company I kept was shallow and hypocritical and really just freeloaded while not really being concerned about me as a person let alone a friend. I started drinking and smoking pot as a way to cope- and having an unhealthy amount of sex with random people, overspending, borrowing money and this really screwed up my college life. Following that I went through a lot of psychiatric treatment including ECT and TMS although nothing helped the suicidal thoughts. I hadn't gone to my very prestigious law school in nearly ten months- and had been living in a silent, hellish existence of no social interaction and little food for months. But I'm lucky to have very supportive parents and have been going to therapy throughout- and the last two months have been much better. In fact I've decided to go back to school till I figure out what I want to do. No two situations are similar and your experience is very different from mine but I'm sure things will get better. It will not be easy and getting better is a process- being patient with yourself and your circumstances, forgiving or at least accepting your past actions and choices and finally coming up with a rough plan for each day, each week etc will help you feel more in control. I recommend therapy but in case you'd avoid it for whatever reason, you can read this book on CBT called Feeling Good by David Burns. PDF versions are available online. My therapist recommended I read it and it genuinely helped a lot. Best of luck to you and you know, I'm pretty much bereft of friends too but I'm moving on from dwelling on that. I'm focusing on me.
TLDR- no matter what your situation is, you can get better. It will take time, effort, patience and practical planning- definitely seek therapy or read CBT books (Feeling Good by D Burns).
