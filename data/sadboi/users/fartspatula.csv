Khabib’s strengths and style are so vastly different than Tony’s, it’s going to be a completely different affair.

We all knew Justin was a competent striker and is fighting smarter/better than ever. Khabib isn’t going to engage Justin for 25 minutes on the feet. I see the matchup being the same as it always was: a legendary grappler vs a tactical savage. I think Khabib is going to choke him out in the 3rd."

Over-the-road (long haul, being out for 2-3 and often many more, weeks at a time) pays very well, the best in trucking from what I gather. It’s a sacrifice but well worth it. I’ll stay out 4 weeks, make great money and often a bonus and take over a week off, sometimes 10 days."
