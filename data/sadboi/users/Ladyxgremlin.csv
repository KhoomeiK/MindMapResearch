I am sorry you are having such a hard time during isolation. I think it has been really difficult on all of us. My parents and I are very close, and it has been very difficult trying to maintain a bit of physical distance. 

I have been trying to get out of the house for at least one walk every day. I don't live in a nice area where I can walk around my neighborhood (road are too narrow), but I live close to some hiking trails. As much as I hate it, exercise helps. For me, I feel it gets some of the aggression and anger out that I have been feeling lately. I take melatonin to help me sleep at night (my sleep has been affected the most). 

I've been trying to videochat with friends lately. Just to see/talk to a face that isn't the voices in my head.

If you have a Nintendo Switch, Animal Crossing has been an unlikely help. It is simple, and innocent, and sometimes that is the perfect distraction from the chaos I've been feeling .

I wish you well, stay safe."
SuicideBereavement,fjwp27v,t3_ff75bn,1583642342.0,"Sounds completely normal to me. 

The funny thing about grief is that you expect it to be linear. You grieve, and then it ends. However, that is not the case. Grief hits me in waves, over the smallest things. I lost my only sibling not even three months ago. Some days I’m happy, or more manic. Some days I’m sad. Most nights I’m sad. The frustrating thing is that I can’t predict how I’m going to feel. It’s exhausting. 

I do recommend you see someone. It was so hard for me to do but so helpful. Try not to worry about feeling awkward. I did, and a good listener shouldn’t care about that."

I lost my younger brother the week before Christmas this past year, and I have a hard time watching any show, because inevitably they have a Christmas Special. This Christmas was so unreal and so painful. I don't know if I am ever going to experience it in a positive way ever again. I find documentaries are pretty tame for the most part. 

I often wonder how we will ever cope? Personally, I view loss by suicide as a chronic, invisible illness. The passersby will not know what we have to go through on a daily basis. Some days are better, some are worse, some are near impossible. It is not a grief that we can just ""get over."" I also have sleep issues. If I drink, I can sleep, but I don't sleep well. Most of the time I can get to sleep but I wake up nearly every hour. Restless mind. Not that it helps much, but hot tea and a book helps most (but I rarely listen to my own advice). I find that my phone is more distracting (which also helps), but does not help me get to sleep at all.

We did not cremate, however we did do a natural burial. It's getting more common where I live. My brother was very eco-friendly and earth conscious. His partner told us that he mentioned to her that he did not want to be cremated, but wanted to be buried naturally, because when he ""decomposed"" he wanted to fertilize the earth, to give something back. Because his burial was natural, we did not have any funeral makeup applied. He looked much more peaceful in his casket (unfinished pine, so it didn't give anything artificial to the environment), buried in his sweatshirt and Red Hot Chili's shirt (they were 100% cotton, so they were allowed, and RHCP was his favorite band). I wish it was the peaceful remains that I remember more. However, the image that haunts me was seeing him that Thursday, wheeled out of the morgue for me to see after my parents had to confirm his death certificate. 

I was on the fence of seeing him. I was so afraid to see him how he was in that moment, rather than the happy image of him I remember seeing just this past Thanksgiving. Not that I would consider it ""lucky"", but a few people I work with have also lost siblings to suicide, so I at least have some genuine support from my coworkers. I do feel thankful that they DO know what I'm going through. One of them asked if I was going to see him, and not to push me but cautioned that I may regret it if I didn't. Ultimately, I am glad I saw him. I felt I owed that to him, as a sister to see him as he was. But, I will never forget it, and I wish I could.

i understand the frustration of seeing his dead face. my younger brother died on a Monday, and when he arrived from his college on the Thursday I went to see him at the funeral home before they touched him up.

His obituary stated “...passed peacefully Monday, December 16 by his own hands.”

I see a counselor about this loss. and she states that part of her job is taking away the stigma of mental illness. I appreciate that, but it has to be your choice. I have no problem telling people (who I know. ) what happened, that he had bipolar depression, that we had no idea he was suicidal. I don’t tell EVERYONE how he died, because it’s sensitive info for some, but if they are genuine, I am more open.

some people push for info you are not ready or willing to give. You have to be gentle with yourself. I understand the fear of gossip, it’s a valid fear. I am open, but I do admit it is draining at times, to mentally go through the pain of talking about my brothers death. For me, I feel it’s necessary. I can accept what happened (though absolutely devastated) and I feel that if I can provide some insight, or give some information to those who are genuinely emotionally invested or hurting I need to do so.

SuicideBereavement,fhhfikw,t1_fhhems3,1581602958.0,"Anger is completely justified, just don't let it consume you. It sounds like your loss was fairly recent. Eating was really hard for me the first few days. It's like being incredibly ill. You're not even hungry. If you can't eat, make sure to drink water. Lots of it. When you eat, eat something bland. Like being sick, if I ate something too crazy it would upset my stomach again and I would be back to square one. Lots of rice, soup. Take vitamins if you can. 

I know at this point it is hard to take care of yourself, but it's necessary. Is there anyone you can talk to? I am seeing a counselor at my college. Believe me, it was VERY difficult for me to do, since I am generally a private person and ""baring my soul"" to a stranger sounded traumatizing. It is actually much more helpful than I initially gave it credit for. 

I can't say it enough. Be gentle with yourself. If you can, try to do one thing a day you enjoy. I don't mean searching for anything crazy. But if an extra long hot shower gives you one second of peace, do that. Start small, but don't give up on yourself."

Amidst all the pain, grief and heartbreak there is a lot of anger. Anger in itself is frustrating. I feel guilty being angry but I am angry all the same. I feel a lot of the same things. I will (eventually) have to go through the deaths of my parents, alone. I won't have my sibling anymore. When they get older, and need help I will of course help them, but there will be no one to help me. That makes me so angry.

In hindsight, maybe I should have pushed him more to be more open with me. I won't ever know now, and that is something that I have to carry with me for the rest of my life. 

I am sorry you lost your friend. I think it is only natural for us to feel like we could have done something.

SuicideBereavement,ffjtgjx,t3_esp8mf,1580006484.0,"I am so sorry for loss. I also lost my brother a week before Christmas. He was my only sibling. I understand what you mean by P.T.S.D. My parents came to my apartment in the middle of the night to tell us what happened. Everytime I  hear a knock at the door I damn near have a panic attack. Actually, any sort of loud noise or knocking is terrifying. I can only hope that time will make that terror less....terrible.

As much as I am terrible at it, communication helps. I started talking to people on this board. I was not ready to talk to a person face to face yet. I just started counseling. It is painful, but ultimately I believe it will be helpful. I try to keep myself busy. I work full-time and went back to work a few weeks ago. Hindsight, I think I went back a bit early, but it wasn't necessarily my choice. However, a few people I work with have also lost loved ones to suicide, so they were very understanding and accommodating about what I could and could not handle. 

My 2 words of advice, reach out. It may be painful, in fact, it will probably be incredibly difficult, but do so. It never really seems to get easier to talk about, but it does get easier knowing that there are those out there that want to help, and more importantly, are there to listen. 

If you have trouble sleeping, please see a doctor. Your body needs sleep to repair, in general. This is even more important when we are in stress. It is harder to cope when we are sleepless. Melatonin may help, but please talk to a doctor first. They would know best. 

Please take care of yourself."
SuicideBereavement,ffjquc7,t1_ff16z0i,1580004583.0,"I find myself thinking about the horror of it all. This truly, is horrible. For you, for me, and for every grieving individual. I often wonder how I will get through it. 

I think I am starting to understand that I am not, ok. I have been trying to put a brave face on, mostly for myself, but for others as well. How else would I be able to go back to work, go back to class? Sure, I could quit my job, but how would I pay for my apartment? Sure, I could take a break from classes, but is my grief worth holding myself back another year before my courses are available again. So, I press on. Its terrible. 

I did go to counseling this past Tuesday. It was not as awful as I anticipated. The reception staff could be warmer, more approachable, but perhaps I am being extra sensitive. My counselor was wonderful though, and I am going to see her again next week. As I rant to her though (this week was a short meeting, just to get to know each other), I had to ask myself ""Am I crazy?"" Nothing makes you seem more insane, than rambling to an absolute stranger as to why you are the way you are. It was funny, in a desperately stressful sort of way. 

Do you ever go back and think of that day? When it all happened? I worked the majority of that day. It was actually not too stressful (I work at an animal hospital, and chaos is pretty standard). I remember coming home and my boyfriend (We are since engaged) made spaghetti, and even rubbed my feet. I feels so damn guilty about it all. We normally make spaghetti every Monday, its been hard to eat since. 

There is something strange about music. I have an...eclectic taste. My family is very musical so I was exposed to all types as a kid. As an adult, I love folk metal, though any metal will do. There was a song that came across my Youtube feed of a band I like around 2pm. I was on my lunchbreak at work and remember though I loved the melody, I did not like the song because it was about suicide. (It's a concept album, so supposedly it made sense, but on its own it was...awful). Having had to go through my brother's phone, and his computer. I realize that was around the time of his death. I cannot tell you how haunting that is. 

I do not feel haunted by my brother, but I feel that I am haunted by the ghost of memory. Such a bittersweet haunting. 

I'm sorry your experience with counseling was not great. Perhaps you just need to find the right person. From everyone I've spoken to, they say that not all counselors are created the same. You may have not found the right one. I hope you have someone to talk to. Are you close to your friends, the ones you were with at the time? I hope they are there for you.

My mom is having a hard time with losing connection. I completely understand where she is coming from. It's been a month today since my brother died. Initially, EVERYONE was contacting us. It was overwhelming, but also comforting to know how many people cared. However, a month as passed by, and one by one those connections are disappearing. Now the lack of communication feels like a loss in itself. I know this is not the right way of thinking about it, but it feels like less people care. A month for others feels like such a long time. For us, everything is still so painful, so fresh. It would be nice to have more connection.

SuicideBereavement,fejq4b5,t1_fehwjpd,1579182982.0,"I understand the frustration of therapy. I just started my spring semester of college classes this week, and reluctantly went to the campus' counseling center. I forced myself to go, just to say that I did. The counseling center did not have an inviting presence, which made the entire scenario off-putting. They were able to schedule me for a first appointment later next week. Though that's not too far away, I cannot help but imagine what would happen to someone if they needed immediate attention. Would they have to wait? That seems completely unfair to me, dangerous even. 

I cannot imagine how hard it is to have to go back to work for you, having worked with your brother. I know people who worked in my brother's department are devastated, and miss even seeing his name labeling his office. I worked with my brother years back. My parent's owned a restaurant and we both worked there for a bit. I worked for a few years, and he only worked on and off since he was early in high school. The restaurant has since closed, I can't even imagine how hard it would be for us as a family to go back there if it was still open. 

I am worried about the family cards, to no longer see my brother's name included on it. Christmas was hard for that reason. I signed my brother's name to one of my mom's gifts since we planned it together, but it was so painful. My brother and I listened to different types of music, so I don't have much connection to that. Going through his playlist, I see lots of songs that are very introspective, and sad. However, my family is very musical. All of us play multiple instruments. If I hear songs that play that I would hear my brother play on the piano it is so nice, but it hurts so bad. 

I am so angry for you about how the police dealt with your brother's things. I think the department around the area where by brother was was a bit more sensitive, but it was still difficult for my family to get around the legal things. My brother died a few hours from where we live, so my parents had to travel to speak to the police, identify him, and collect his things. It was so difficult for them to have to wait in a hotel before anyone was ready to speak to them. It must have been so painful. 

&#x200B;

It's been a month since today that he died. I did not anticipate that it would be much easier for me to process things now, than it was a month ago, but secretly I was hoping that it was. It is still so hard. Most people are expecting me to be getting back to normal (except for close family/friends), and it's exhausting. People ask ""what's wrong?"" anticipating a different answer because for THEM, a month seems like such a long time. Time does not seem linear. Everything is so fresh."

My dad's phone broke around the same time my brother died, and he would like to use my brothers phone. However, they did not want to lose all his pictures, so I went through his phone and downloaded them to my parents computer. He had a folder of pictures named ""d."" Looking through them, I understood that ""d,"" stood for ""depression."" They were not photos but artsy pictures. Not ones he drew, but clearly those he has collected. They were horrible. Showed how I can only assume he was feeling. He had bipolar depression, but never expressed suicidal thoughts to his family. I do not know about his friends. 

I understand how you are feeling, at least I think I do, having gone through a similar scenario. I went through his Youtube history, his email, trying to find something, some answers. Realistically, all it gave me was pain. Most of his Youtube history was benign, general things he would usually watch related to his hobbies. A portion of it wasn't.

Caring for myself is hard. Not because I don’t want to, because I do. I am just consumed with thoughts of others. If I can care for myself, don’t I have the time for others? I want to be available for family, if they need someone to talk to I want to be there without hesitation. I don’t want anyone to feel alone. Though this rate is unsustainable. If I don’t slow down, I’ll get sick, the body’s attempt to manually shut me down so I can get some rest.   


I am lucky enough to have a fantastic support system . We may grieve but we grieve together"

SuicideBereavement,fe0aqdi,t1_fe08vjk,1578807991.0,"I feel for you. I wish I had a religious connection to turn to. My brother was atheist, as am I. I would be lying if I said I didn’t want to turn to the nearest church I could find to talk to a priest. Not for the religious connection, but for the human connection. I wish I had a religion. I could then blame God. I can only blame my brother, and THAT hurts.

Speaking my brothers name hurts. It’s a common name. I have heard it all the time since his death. Each time feels like a fresh wound. I miss him so terribly I want to scream. I am currently in bed, typing, silent weeping next to my fiancée, who I don’t want to wake, since he has already heard me cry so much in his waking hours. 

People should be more sensitive. 

I am generally a cynical person, though I am now different. Everyone has their own burden. Because I do not want to reveal my pain to everyone does not make it any less real. 

Forgive my ramblings. I am sorry. I am sorry for your pain."
SuicideBereavement,fe0856s,t3_end40f,1578805645.0,"Yikes.

I understand. My younger brother, and only sibling committed suicide nearly a week before this Christmas.   


I have always loved seeing both sides of a discussion, except for this. I have had not had answer many “what happened.” My parents were honest in his obituary...”he died peacefully by his own hands,” they wrote.

I admire their honesty.   


Rarely, they ask “how?”   


I (even more) rarely, elaborate.

I understand this is ”morbid curiosity” but it is so personal. Not everyone needs to know"
depression,fe072f6,t3_clue8y,1578804754.0,"Hi. 

Please don’t think of me as insensitive. It is not my intention. I beg of you, do not allow yourself to die. 

Allow me to attempt to explain myself, please.

My younger brother, my only sibling committed suicide Dec 16, 2019. He struggled with bipolar depression for years. He was smart, he was intelligent, he a science masters’s degree student. He is dead.

I can be depressed, but I am not depressed. I cannot understand what it is like to feel this way, but I CAN understand what it is like to be left behind. I see my parents struggle. I have no living siblings, now. My brother’s pain may be over for him, but it has not been erased. It has been multiplied and shattered. A piece of it lives, festers inside me, and all those who love/d him.

Maybe what I say does not help. It certainly cannot bring my brother back. But I can tell you I would give EVERYTHING to have one more moment with him.

As hard as it is, life is more than you. Forgive my insensitivity. I am angry, but I care. I hope you prove yourself wrong. 

I’m sure you’ve heard it before, but if you want to talk, there are people who want to listen. (Myself included)"

SuicideBereavement,fe05cty,t3_enfwcl,1578803447.0,"I am so incredibly sorry. 

My younger brother, my only sibling, killed himself a week before Christmas this year. We were very close. i knew he had bipolar depression but he NEVER once expressed to me any suicidal thoughts. We spoke 4-5 times a week.   


Do not apologize for incoherence or selfishness. You are allowed to feel, as you feel. Unfortunately, feelings come and go so fast, be it anger, sadness, etc. The littlest things trigger memories. If you are like me, you will see your friend’s face in the faces of strangers. 

My advice, feel WHAT you feel, WHEN you feel it. I have always been the person to repress, and I can’t do it anymore. The bravest thing you can say is “help me”.   


We are here for you. You are not alone."
SuicideBereavement,fe040xa,t1_fcx1hdr,1578802533.0,"Hey.

Sorry it’s taken me so long to respond. I completely understand.

This Christmas was surreal. It was so so hard on my family. I’m sure it was for you as well. We have a family tradition of opening gifts in front of the fireplace. My brother was always “Santa” and would give out stockings and evenly divide gifts between us so we all finished opening gifts at the same time. He was 4.5 years younger than me, and a general late sleeper. On Christmas Day though, he would launch himself on my bed early and beg to open gifts. He did that until he hit about 20 but it was still the only day he would wake before 8am on a day he didn’t need to work. I missed that immensely this year. I always liked to joke he would “wake me up” when realistically I would be just as excited as he was. 

My parents and I opened gifts in a different room, at noon rather than at 8am. Even after his passing we got gifts for him. We shared them, but it was too fresh to not include him, even if he was only there in spirit. It was wonderful, but it was so incredibly painful. The wonder was not from joy, but merely our ability to exist as the remainder as our family and the insistence to try to put our best foot forward. I got a spa-like gift for my mom. It was a gift my brother and I wanted to go “halfsies” on, since it was pricey. He loved that gift idea. He never got around to giving me his half, due to his passing, but I got the gift anyways and signed his name on the gift tag. THAT was one of the hardest things I’ve needed to do. I may have paid for it, but it was from him as much as me. It was hard to write, and it was hard for Mom to read, but I could not have left him off of it. I feel for Dad. He has been so strong, and yet so quiet. I feel his pain, palpable in the air, like a weight visible only to my mind’s eye. I hurt because of my loss, I nearly hurt more for their’s. 

New Years was...surreal. My brother died in 2019. It is 2020, yet not even a month has passed. That fact makes time seem non-linear to me. I also spent New Years with friends. Around midnight I isolated myself outside, speaking to the ether, hoping my brother would somehow hear me. I hurt.

I got engaged a few days ago. My fiancée and I have been together 15 years. (I am 29). He knew my brother since he was a child. For this, I am so incredibly elated. I love my fiancée so incredibly much. He has seen me at my strongest, and my weakest. I look forward to our life together. 

Yet, I mourn. 

I am loved. I have lost. I am happy. I am broken. My future makes me optimistic, my past makes me cynical. I am peaceful. I am miserable. 

I feel like I am all these things. My emotions hit me relentlessly. I am merely riding the waves, however they fall. 

I have a strong support system. My family is strong. My coworkers (some who have also lost family members to suicide) are incredibly supportive. My friends are available. In that, I am lucky. 

Forgive me for talking about myself. I do not have a therapist. I do not know you personally, but I appreciate you. In a distant way, I feel connected. 

My brother talked about travel as well. You mentioned Finland, he talked Iceland. I am sorry about the loss of your cat. I work at an animal hospital (I have for years) and I understand how they are a part of your family. I am sorry for your additional loss. You mention your brother was going to graduate. Mine too. He was nearly done with his master’s program. He did some gaming too, loved any Zelda game. I have his Gameboy color, his Nintendo DS now. He had Zelda in the DS. 


How are you doing? It’s been 2 weeks and I hope you are ok. I hope you are trying to heal."
GriefSupport,fcwhwro,t3_ej40wm,1578026067.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. 

My younger brother, and only sibling, killed himself a week before this past Christmas, just barely 3 weeks ago. He was 24. I am 29. I understand how you are feeling and not feeling. I feel a little guilt, I think it’s only natural. Though we were very close and spoke 2+ times a week on the phone. I knew he struggled with bipolar 2 for a few years, but I never pushed him to talk about something he didn’t bring up himself. Maybe I should have. I’ll never know now. That finality is very hard to live with. There are so many unanswered questions. 

To me, this feels like a horrible nightmare. Not just for the loss of my brother, but being alive to bear witness to the pain my parents and family are in. My brothers decision was not personal, it was not about any of us or anyone, but it does not make it easier for the living. I am not suicidal or self-harming, but I am pained. 

I am planning on seeing someone for this. It will not be easy, but I think it is necessary. I really appreciate sites such as this for this reason. This is a wonderful place to share grief, to get feelings out, even if only on “paper.” I recommend you do the same. I have a very difficult time talking out my feelings, but this helps. 

if you ever want to talk, send me a message. Take care."
SuicideBereavement,fcwglg9,t1_fcavs9y,1578025092.0,"Thank you. 

Did you also have a hard time this Christmas? New Years? I have moments where I am fine. Where I am numb and can just get through the day nearly normal. Other moments hit me like an avalanche, cold and chaotic. I bounce back and forth from feeling like I’m in extreme denial, or just depression. I was browsing my amazon lists today and forgot I had a wishlist for him for this Christmas. Gifts I never got to buy him. I have his address and credit card info too, since he was in college and I would let him use my Prime account so he could save some money. 

He was almost 5 years my junior, and when we were kids we weren’t really close. 5 years is a big age gap when you’re a kid. Though when he graduated high school, we became very close. Since then we talked on the phone at least 2x a week and saw each other around every holiday. We were both dedicated students/workers and it was hard to find time off. 

I cannot imagine if he was my twin. I am so sorry for your loss. What was your brother like?

Mine was an activist of sorts. Masters student at a great college. Avid hiker and climber, hiked all 46 peaks of the Adirondacks before 24. He cared so much, as a science major he was very in touch with how the world was suffering (tbh, this was probably a contributing factor), very conscious of where his food/clothes came from. Incredibly kind, and would never hesitate to help another person. 

It’s very hard. He was my only sibling. I miss him incredibly. Sorry for my rambling, but thank you for listening."

In a whole, this is just terrible, and I am trying to do deal with this stress the best way I can. Part of me is incredibly strong, giving myself and others someone to talk to and to lean on. But my other self is small and sad.
