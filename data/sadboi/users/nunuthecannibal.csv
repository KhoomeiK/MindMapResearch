A couple years pass and I start college. My mental health had started to improve since I was breaking out of my shell and making friends, so I didnt see that looming dark one for a long time. 

Fast forward about 6 years and all of a sudden, the dark one was back. He told me to choke myself, stab myself, punch, scratch, and burn myself. It was awful, then I had a psychotic break. It told me to eat all my pills. I didnt want to die, tbh I was really just kinda anxious for the day, but it told me to so I did it. I freaked out and called my therapist, then got admitted to a mental hospital. That was rock bottom for me, I think. Since then, that was 3 years ago, I'm doing better. I have a stable job, health insurance, friends, no dark looming creature telling me what to do. (Not all the time at least). I'm terrified for my foundation to falter.
