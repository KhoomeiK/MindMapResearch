When you are ready and have had enough of the life you currently feel, you will go to that place or time or hurt or pain and figure that out.

I cannot stand the academics. I recovered from the hate and anger and abandonment issues. I never took meds.

I have suffered under my own childhood trauma and the life it once gave me to realize that recovery is possible once you decide for yourself and to commit to the work. It took me 40 plus years to figure it out. I share my thoughts and my journey so that others can see another view or hear another voice that does not shame and blame while going about it. It is a delicate balance between expressing thoughts and views on self expression and experiences vs. expressing an opinion that can help another person on their journey to recovery.

In the end, society seems to have placed those who suffer from mental illness in a box of shame, blame and a guilty verdict. Casting them aside for they are all lost hopes of genetic malfunctions or some other terrible tragedy. Give them meds for they cannot heal. That is not true. 

Helping others is the karma that allows me to heal plus it also allows me to express myself. Being an INFJ male and not being allowed to do this causes serious mental issues for me with regards to inner voice and OCD compulsive behavior.

BPD,fqq5l1c,t1_fqocmmo,1589559781.0,"Sure. Here you go. :)

The original poster made a comment on ‚ÄòDAE‚Äô...

The twist comes from the angle that some people with BP ask questions to others about there actions and then want others to say, ‚Äú yes. I am the same. ‚Äú

The issue is that most of those ‚Äò DAE ‚Äò do this or that are negative and either harm them or abuse others. 

When the poster asks ‚ÄòDAE‚Äô and the return is a laundry list of ‚Äò ya, I do‚Äô or ‚Äò yes, that is very common‚Äô or ‚Äòall the time, yep‚Äô it reinforces the posters actions instead of:

‚Äò why are you asking if others (DAE) because what you are doing is F‚Äôd up and not only harming you but probably also abusing others ‚Äò

So...

I as a responder to your post or comment on a DAE is not going to get any effort from me because it will only justify your continued actions. Which YOU already know are unhealthy to yourself and also probably abusing others around you. 

With that said...

If you know this all and can have the thought to come on Reddit and ask a DAE question then you are clearly in the know about what you are doing so therefor can change it based on it being a negative action within your life.  

But instead of changing and fixing it you as the poster or commenting person would rather find out if others also commit the same DAE action and based on a collective basis of other persons with same behavior, you self validate, continue original DAE action.  No improved behavior. 

Said more simple: the original poster was basically saying that anybody who is BPD and asks a DAE question is basically upset because they perpetuate the problem by self validating negative actions when others with BPD say, ‚Äú yes, I do the same‚Äù. So the action must be okay to continue to do. 

I hope that makes sense. It is complicated to really say in words but I get it, it is a true comment, valid with a little back handed criticism. 

The reason is because when you have BPD you also do not want to feel alone so knowing others feel or go through the same can be caring and loving and very healthy. It can save a life and also put you on the road to recovery. 

See how it‚Äôs a double sided coin?  I hope I did better explaining. Maybe I should do a video on this topic. It is a good one.

1. Nope. You cannot turn into an INFJ. That is not possible. 

2. Does childhood trauma affect the INFJ more so then other types. I would first say NO but in the end I would struggle to say YES and mean it.  So yes because of the way an INFJ processes and sees what is NOT visible. 

What that means is this: the INFJ child is already trying to pull away from the trauma but it can‚Äôt because the function of feeling is pulling the child toward the trauma. This is very difficult to go through and I believe it really does not allow the INFJ to protect itself like other types. Does that make sense?

You are thinking too much in terms of what YOU need and require.  Please try to find a balance between what will work, make you happy and make her happy.  Right now it‚Äôs all about you and your feelings. You are too smart to understand that that is not going to be successful for your life. 

I hope that makes sense and I have a video on it called 50 shades of grey and also another called how do you know when your marriage ended and another called men need to try harder.  

I hope that helps. Wait for the possible heat I am going to get for this post. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

He is wrong in all ways based on your post taken at face value.  I would never , NEVER, even think to consider what he is doing based on the post. 

What is more important to you is that you are getting a glimpse of who he is. I promise you this:

‚Äú his actions and concern for your feelings and the other thoughts and feelings you shared as it relates to what and how a couple acts should be your concern and not any of the jealous feelings. ‚Äú

I want you to take your post and find someone who does not know you and ask them to read it. Then ask them this question:

‚Äú Would you stay with this person and build a life and a family or would you walk away? ‚Äú

Wait for the answer. Might as well ask yourself the same question and let‚Äôs listen closely to what your inner voice says back to you. 

Oh, my bad. That is painful to hear which is why you are on Reddit asking us if your feelings and emotions are valid instead of trusting yourself that they are and realizing that your inner voice has already spoken, but your conscious mind cannot or does not want to see that result.  So you are ignoring your feelings and your inner voice.

I woke up one day and ( IT WAS ONE DAY ) I said this to myself, 

‚Äú I cannot take it anymore. I can‚Äôt! I hate me! I hate living! I want to be happy. I want to love me. I want to love my mom and not hate her. I want to hug her again. I want to feel that hug like when I was a little boy. I want to feel excited for her to see me and to miss her like I once did. I don‚Äôt want to hate my step father anymore. I want to live. I want to heal my inner pain.  I want to let go of the anger. I want to stop the triggers. I want to love and to be loved by my girlfriends. I want to be the best I can. I want the depression to stop. I want to wake up and smile. I want to know what it feels like to smile and truly have calm and happiness. I don‚Äôt want to be that man anymore with girlfriends. Insecure.  In fear all the time. Alone. I don‚Äôt want to cry anymore. I want to live!!!!‚Äù

...and with that...

I said, 

‚Äú I do not care how much pain I feel. What inner demons I uncover. I am going to reach down into me so deep and I am going to love and heal and finally listen and honor that little boy who lives inside me and is and was destroyed, abandoned and abused emotionally and mentally and physically by all the adults and parents in my life. I am going to let that little boy heal. ‚Äú

I now share my journey on my YouTube channel and share the deepest thoughts and emotions so that maybe, just maybe, anything I say or do will save another life or help another life to get on the same journey that I am now on without being religious or spiritual.  To offer anything other then the hate and bullshit that plagues our world today.  I am not trying save anybody.  I am just trying to be something different. Something good.  And ...

By just being me and being completely honest and open and sincere. 

I meant no harm. I meant no disrespect.  I promise. I am sorry if I did or upset or offended. Or anything.  

I respect what you said and I hope this text just lets another person know and understand what I was hoping you would share.  And that it will also explain to you what I meant. I wasn‚Äôt clear and that‚Äôs my fault. 

I wanted to hear your answer. I wanted to hear what saved you.

Think of trust as a full tank of gas. Each time you meet a person they get a one time fill up. Only once. Each mile is a little bit of gas that is removed. Just like when you drive. Each mile is a example of trust or an act of trust that is taken. 

As the miles add up the trust is being lost or taken away.  There are no more fill ups. See the example. 

I hope this helps. I am sorry. Trust cannot be rebuilt. It will always be on your mind just like the watching of the cause gage is always on your mind no matter what you do. It‚Äôs always there as you drive.
