Yet having compassion for ourselves and being forgiving and continuing the arduous process of simultaneously healing AND changing our bad behaviours at the same time (DI alectical).

DebateAVegan,fqa2ylo,t1_fq5aiu5,1589211882.0,"I love this! Thank you for sharing this. I think we should all ease up on omnis ESPECIALLY when they genuinely might want to try but are not there yet and it's ok! It's ok to be ignorant and not have all the right answers. It's ok to not be able to even be self-aware enough or even lucid enough to even have the thoughts in your head to want to make the world a better place. It's ok to ERR. It's ok to be human! I have been vegetarian since I was 17 (I'll be 26 in 2 months) and vegan for about 4 years now. I 100% will admit that I used to get very angry and emotional about my stance and was once not ok at all with the term ""flexatarian"" I thought it was so stupid. But now I realize me thinking that way is very arrogant. And in doing so I am NOT being compassionate to ALL animals/sentient species. We will NEVER achieve any gains or positive change if we continue to be so aggressive and completely inflexible with others. Who cares if someone is flexatarian for a while, they are still reducing meat intake! And  who knows, it might take several weeks, months, years, or even 2 DECADES but then in the future they might go vegan as well!! We have to practice patience, love, and compassion for all species. Even those that might seem like they don't care ... Remember we all come from different places and walk in very different ""shoes."" You never know the reason behinds someone's perceived ignorance/hate/indifference. They might come from abusive households and suffer from depression, suicidal thoughts, other mental health issues. Just because some can come from extreme abuse and still be able to make the choice to go vegan early on (like myself), it doesn't mean that it's ok to demonize others that for whatever reason find it a lot more difficult to do so. *PARTICULARLY* not ok when those people have started to make an INKLING of transition and have decided to do so slowly and maybe choose to be ""flexatarian"" for a while. We have to make veganism COMFORTABLE and associated with compassion and love for ALL so that ALL may look at it and feel safe and WELCOME. No matter what part of their animal rights/environmental rights/human rights journey they're in. 

It will feel uncomfortable. It will feel like we are ""allowing bad things to happen."" 

But we just have to be patient, it is all just part of the journey. 💛"

He will try (most likely) *insanely* hard to manipulate you again and get back together!! I have been there... It's hellish. No contact is the best advice that any professional would give."
