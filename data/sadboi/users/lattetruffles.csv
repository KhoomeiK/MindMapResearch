EDAnonymous,foa0x08,t3_g6jd3k,1587636889.0,"It depends, from what I gather orthorexia (I am not a professional or anything at ALL) encompasses the obsessive thoughts on eating a healthy diet and is not driven by body image or desired thinness as much as AN, however a ‚Äúfit‚Äù body may be the driving force for it.  I think exercise is a factor in orthorexia as it relates to nutrition and staying healthy, so perhaps. Diagnosis are very difficult unless you have a team who can professionally assess you, as there are a fair few people in treatment who still do not have a ‚Äúclear diagnosis‚Äù such as Anorexia Nervosa, ARFID etc."

Being so underweight that you cannot get out of bed is extremely serious and should not be treated lightly. I know it is difficult but opening up to someone professional or a family member for help will make everything 100% better. If the case may arise, you could be sent inpatient if you are malnourished/ have irregularity with your heart or susceptible to refeeding syndrome. It may seem terrifying but your health should be put first. Anorexia is very detrimental, especially if you carry on the way you are. This may seem like an intense comment however it is written with concern and with your best interest of well-being at heart. I hope you are okay"

EDAnonymous,fmw48bv,t3_fxqmp2,1586439166.0,"Here is my take. TRIGGER WARNING
An eating disorder is a serious mental illness. Emphasis on the word ‚Äúserious‚Äù.  A lot of us here went through your current thought process. At first it may be a quick fix or ‚Äúdiet‚Äù  to lose a few lbs, but if the wrong path is taken, it can lead to a life of misery, anxiety and suffering. You will feel fatigued, light-headed and dizzy. Your stomach may twist and turn and feel knotted - and when you do eat, it is excruciating.  Walking around the shops will feel like you have ran a marathon, your muscles will feel tired and sore, your bones brittle. It can lead to infertility, osteoporosis and cardiovascular complications (like a heart attack). Every day will revolve around food. When, what, where, with whom. In a paradoxical sense, it will consume you. You will be irritable, even depressed. Being ravenously hungry will leave you detached from friends and family, you will isolate. Your extremities will go numb, your hair may fall out and wounds will not heal. Moreover, malnutrition will proceed. For example, low calcium, low potassium etc. If you are growing, you will be stunted. Perhaps there will be bone scans, ECGs or many blood tests. One singular grape will become a number, among the frequent calculations of calorific intake that swallow up your day. You will fight with yourself. ‚ÄúYou cannot eat this! It is over your limit!‚Äù  A ‚Äúrun‚Äùin the fresh air will become mandatory, a military regime. You will feel cold all the time. That relieving air conditioning will bite like a malicious, whipping winter gale right through you. Depending on its severity it may affect you for the rest of your life, but if you can catch it now, just like any other illness you can treat it easier, as if you leave it, it will become very hard to escape. I suggest you take into consideration how you want your life to be, and the most important word is BALANCE. A good balance of exercise, eating a varied diet and doing things you love to keep you mentally healthy is of chief importance. Know your worth and perhaps seek professional help if you feel trapped.  X"

EatingDisorders,fmats0l,t3_fu4udr,1585907521.0,"As the comment above said, eating throughout the day, though it may be difficult at first as you are used to restriction, will be the best. Firstly it will make you feel more energised throughout the day and you wont feel ‚Äúfaint‚Äù or like you are running on empty/ in waiting for dinner. 
Secondly, you will be less bloated as your stomach will have time to digest the food throughout the day. It may seem daunting but as a rule many say 3 meals a day (including snacks if you can) . 
A wholesome breakfast which stops bloating for me is something wholegrain such as oatmeal.  I think the main reason you have bloating is the volume of food you are eating in that timeframe in comparison to the rest of the day, your stomach is still in shock that its being feed as its in starvation mode!"

It‚Äôs good that you are considering your feelings as the earlier you do so the better with this illness because it can do immense and serious damage the deeper you get into it.
