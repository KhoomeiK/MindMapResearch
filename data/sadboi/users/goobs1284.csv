I came to the same conclusion: I was super productive, but it wasn't sustainable and I was just thinking about how much I missed it. 

So now, I've taken this to a different level, if I enjoy getting high but not the negative effects of smoking, I changed carriers. Instead of smoking, I made tinctures. Slightly different effect but I've steadily reduced the number of times I smoke a day. Also reduces how fucked I get.
