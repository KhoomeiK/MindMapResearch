lgbt,fm879a7,t3_ftmjsv,1585844124.0,"As someone who is genderfluid, take your time! I explored with alot of labels before I came to this one and the more you rush, the less happy you might be. The way I deal with dysphoria is try to find something to keep your mind off of it like a hobby. If that doesn't work, try to explore styles of hair or clothes that may make you less dysphoric. As for pronouns, you don't have to have she/her or he/him as pronouns even if you're feeling more feminine or masculine. They/them can be used to express you as a person and not as a particular gender. 

I hope this kind of helps and I hope that you can figure it out in one way or another! Much love üíõ"
lgbt,fm85sx2,t3_ftn1w5,1585843347.0,"In my experience, and how I use the word bisexual, is the attraction to my own sex plus others and with preferences. This doesn't have to apply to everyone because people can use whatever label they find fit. 

Pansexual is the attraction to people regardless of gender. Other people's gender isn't part of the attraction in another person. On the same spectrum, omnisexual is the attraction to all genders but the gender does come into play, and polysexual is the attraction to more than one but not all genders. 

I hope that kind of clears it up, although bisexual has more than one definition and people are free to use whatever feels right to them ‚ù§üíúüíô"

depression,f6k7tt4,t3_dpl4bu,1572906937.0,"I understand what you're saying and I'm glad you brought attention. I've always saw it as ""conforming"" to an environment. The people around you can affect your mood and for some it's so extreme where you seem like a different person. I personally think I might have problems with this. In school I do fine, laugh and talk with friends. I get good grades and do all my work. Out in public is an iffy. Sometimes I'll feel as if I can't show any emotion at all and other times I'll feel like an entirely different person with a different personality. 

Anywhere at home or when I'm by myself or with family members I act almost like a zombie. I feel as if I can't feel anything at all and others are just going to be judging me for anything I do. 

This could go hand and hand with bipolar disorder but more predictable. Instead of changing personalities, it's mood that changes depending on your location and people you're with. I'll definitely do more research on this and maybe we can all learns something."
