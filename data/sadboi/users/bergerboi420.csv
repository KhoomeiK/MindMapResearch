My state is supposed to have an employee enforcing proper social distancing measures in every business for it to stay open. The majority of my last few shifts, I’ve barely had a quiet moment long enough to begin to remember to wipe down the counter tops and pinpads. I might have mentioned this in the original comment, but a police officer even got upset at us today because customers were crowding outside our store in the morning. I feel pretty powerless in what I can do, but asking for some more time to clean is at least something..."

I work at Joann Fabrics, I’ve been working there for probably just about a month. At a time like this, Joanns is not essential. We are helping out a bit by assembling mask kits that customers can sew and bring back for us to donate to hospitals, and that’s good! But... we’ve only received maybe fifteen masks over the last two days, and have given out fifty or more mask kits in my last two shifts alone. We are doing something helpful, but we are not essential.

My state put forward a new order two days ago that said all businesses that could not keep six feet between customers and employees (and within those two groups) had to close for safety. 

I have been 2-3 feet away from nearly every customer that I’ve had to ring up because of counter/checkout aisle space, and all of my coworkers have to go right past each other in multiple areas of the store that are small but necessary for employees to be in. Most customers are so impatient to enter the store, they won’t let me get on the other side of the door before they shove past me to enter. We are limiting our store to five customers at a time, but if all five are inches away from me on their way in and out, that will likely lose some of it’s effectiveness... I let in/out probably seventy five percent of the customers that came during my shift.

I do appreciate having a job right now, but we unquestionably are not safe and are not following the orders given by our state. I don’t want to get sick and I don’t want to get others sick. A LOT of elderly people shop at our store, too, so... If anyone who is sick with Covid-19 gets their germs on the fabric, countertops, door handles, et cetera...

TLDR: I want my store to close. We aren’t being safe, and we get lots of elderly customers. How do I do that?"

WalgreensStores,fhmiuem,t3_f3y2y6,1581713435.0,"That’s happened to our store several times... it usually lasts anywhere from a day to a couple weeks. We call in someone to fix it, they say it’s fixed, and half the time it starts beeping again. I hope yours stops beeping soon :("
Guildwars2,fhk1px5,t1_fhj0kdv,1581663079.0,Thank you so much for sharing this!!
Guildwars2,fhiwjr8,t1_fhip8gi,1581633259.0,"I can’t speak for others, but I felt blinded after opening up gw2 during HoT. It was like... a mini emotional endeavor to get through that for me. That being said, a lot of my playtime back then was in the middle of the night in a dark room with my screen on full brightness, so that may be on me."
Guildwars2,fhiwcxi,t1_fhiibo3,1581633150.0,What did the factions one look like?? I missed them all besides the EotN one
WalgreensStores,fhekct2,t3_f2lbvx,1581524231.0,We occasionally get these and it’s annoying!! Thankfully I’ve never heard a customer complain about it at my store so it’s not too ridiculous... yet...
WalgreensStores,fhejo8g,t3_f2km79,1581523824.0,"I wish I was either more like an NPC or less like an NPC. 

More like an NPC would mean I could just stand up front all day and wipe down the counter when I wasn’t checking out customers, yet still get paid the same and not have to worry about the other store functions.

Less like an NPC would let me feel like every day is less repetitive... which would be refreshing. And I could feel like an actual human being, not just part of the checkout process."
WalgreensStores,fhd0w4n,t1_fhc4aea,1581474948.0,You can??? I’m definitely asking about that next time I work oh my god. I swear it’s too loud to mentally cancel out.
WalgreensStores,fhboga8,t3_f20kkh,1581446487.0,"One morning I walked into the store before opening and I didn’t hear music... I thought the PA system went down in our store... and then a couple seconds passed and the next song played. It was a blissful few seconds, regardless. 

I wish we could just NOT HAVE MUSIC PLAYING. Like does it really make the shopping experience so much better for customers?? It definitely makes my day a whole lot worse."
WalgreensStores,fhbo0m1,t3_f2bhpe,1581446226.0,"It’s been harder lately to put up with it. My mental health has gotten worse recently because I’m processing something, and it’s made every day a nightmare. I just try to reset between every transaction in the hopes that my negative emotions won’t build up. It works only sometimes. The breaks are what get me through the day."
