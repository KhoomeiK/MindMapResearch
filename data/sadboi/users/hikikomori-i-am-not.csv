There's YouTube videos all over the place, they're worth a watch."
AmItheAsshole,fr61ssw,t1_fr5zpxr,1589918414.0,"I'd start with stir fry or soups and probably frozen veg. Frozen veg is harvested at its peak and immediately frozen, so for taste it's only really beat by something equally in season and fresh. With stir fry, you cook the protein, add the veg, and then the sauce, then serve over rice (or mix in the rice, if you prefer). Since it has a sauce and some spices, you're not eating the veg plain, and that can help you adjust to the taste until you don't need a lot. 

You can also add some to ramen, if you eat that. It'll pick up the taste of the broth while it's cooking, so it's not just the pure veg taste if you aren't used to it. 

Roasting and pan frying are also great options. I add onions to almost anything I cook, because when it's cooked low and slow, it becomes soft and sweet. That, some garlic, a little basil, maybe mushrooms, and some good harvest garden red sauce makes a very good vegetarian pasta sauce, which you can then add hamburger or Italian sausage into if you want meat.

Soups are super easy. Cook meat if you're adding any (bacon flavors the broth well! Chop it into fine bits and fry it at the start in some butter), add tougher root vegetables (like carrots or potatoes), then after a few minutes, any other not-leafy veg (frozen works here, and is precisely what I always do), then your broth (water+bullion is the cheap option) and any herbs or spices you want to use. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer and leave it for 45min-an hour (doesn't need to be watched while simmering, set a timer and go play games or something). Shortly before you're ready to eat, add any starches (noodles, cooked rice, etc) and any leafy greens you want to wilt (chopped baby spinach does well, imo), and flour or corn starch if you want it thicker like stew. Serve with bread.

That's all a novel, but I hope I gave you an idea lol."

Tell me that I'm not actually bleeding for eight days? That I imagined how bad my cramps are (objectively, they hurt more than broken bones. I was in an accident where I shattered two bones and dislocated one of my joints and I told the ER nurses that it hurt less than my cramps normally do. They've been bad enough before that I couldn't stand or drink water without vomiting—I had to be given anti-nausea medicine just to be able to take pain meds). That there's no way I started getting it when I was 10? Also, giving advice for said issues that is just objectively wrong.

Other experiences include men who tried to tell me how bra sizes work?

Totally wrong, on multiple levels), but are totally convinced that I and actual literal professionals are wrong and they know better?

Even if it's around 0.5-1% of people for whom that's not the case, that's significant in a sample size of over 7 billion, being, at the very minimum, over 35 million people.

AmItheAsshole,fprz4vy,t1_fpry597,1588864735.0,"OP said the grounding happened after the panic attack incident, not after saying that she didn't have a sister. And we're supposed to judge based on the information given. 

Even if OP isn't telling the whole truth, the parents still suck for leaving OP and Jess together without someone who could manage Jess' panic attacks being there. That wasn't a safe situation for either of them. 

>brother and the legal issues, that's not true.

Not saying it's universal, but in my state, it would. After a certain age, there at least needs to be a divider when opposite sex siblings share a room."
AmItheAsshole,fprx7vb,t1_fprp6nq,1588863747.0,"Imo, the parents are TA for expecting OP to be ""in charge"" of Jess, who is obviously traumatized and prone to panic attacks, and punishing her for not magically knowing how to manage panic attacks. That's not your standard ""we're going out for the night, can you make sure little bro/sis eat something and don't get severely injured/die?"" babysitting.

I'd also argue that Jess herself deserves her own private room. Between her anxiety (how well will she sleep before she and OP are at the stage where they're really close? Will she be able to sleep with a relative stranger in her room? Will she trust OP enough to sleep soundly?) and her night terrors (waking up screaming all night would also wake OP, and would probably cause guilt/resentment, and that's just not fair to either of them), she should be in her own room. However, OP also shouldn't have to share a room with her brother, and in my state that'd actually cause legal issues, if not now, then in a year or two when he starts puberty."
AmItheAsshole,fprvoj2,t1_fprj64k,1588862931.0,"The social worker would probably, at the very least, agree that OP shouldn't feel like she needs to choose between sharing a room with an opposite-sex sibling who will be starting puberty in the few years (in my state, that can actually be a legal issue) and sharing with a sister who has severe night terrors that make her wake up screaming all night. And will almost definitely agree that OP, a high school sophomore, shouldn't *ever* be in charge of the traumatized sister who has panic attacks and sprints off if a stranger touches her."
AmItheAsshole,fpruv3c,t1_fprisg4,1588862486.0,"You're a high schooler. You don't have the skills to comfort a traumatized teenager having a panic attack, nor should you NEED them at this stage. I find it pretty disgusting that your parents are punishing you for not knowing how to manage someone having a panic attack who sprinted off. If that's a risk with Jess, then she probably shouldn't be going out unless she has someone who knows how to help (ie, not you) until she's ready. At the very least, you shouldn't be ""in charge"" of keeping her safe.

NTA. Your parents are TA."
AmItheAsshole,fproj1e,t1_fprh6hf,1588858906.0,"While true, there's also a difference between speaking ""correctly"" and speaking colloquially. Native speakers speak differently than people who have only learned about it in language classes and never lived/worked/etc in a place that speaks the language, and I'd argue that unless you can speak colloquially, you aren't fully fluent.

Like, most English speakers would likely feel like someone who ONLY uses the absolute ""most proper"" English sounds a little weird and wooden. If someone like that corrected me any time I didn't use the subjunctive in English, I'd be asking them questions, too."

Her hair is perfectly natural. The products she's using take care of her hair, just like straight-haired people generally use conditioner to keep it healthy. Except, curly/coily/kinky hair is more fragile and needs more products to keep it fully healthy."
me_irlgbt,fpq8zin,t1_fpkglv1,1588817601.0,"I'm late to respond, but pan is essentially attraction to all genders, sometimes with the implication being that it's equal/that gender doesn't even factor in, whereas bi is attraction to at least two genders (and can be all, or may not be), and may or may not indicate preferences, etc. It's kind of a ""all trapezoids are 4 sided, but not all 4 sided shapes are trapezoids,"" thing?

I prefer using panromantic to biromantic because I don't have a strong preference any which way, and because my attraction to any gender is identical—which is a different experience from some of my bi friends, who told me it feels different for them. Other people who feel identical to me may prefer bi for their own reasons, but I personally like using pan. Bi just doesn't ring right to me, ya know? Not sure how else to explain it."

I don't understand the logic with peeing out of your clit. There isn't even a hole? And if women could pee standing, why wouldn't we???"

AmItheAsshole,fpit9uj,t3_gdihtr,1588648211.0,"NTA. God, at her age I'd be lucky if no internet for a while was my only punishment. 

More likely the conditions for getting it back would be needing to learn how to avoid scams (my parents would make sure that I have access to videos or something to help), and understanding it well enough that I could teach someone else how to do it, and also ""working off"" any money that couldn't be charged back—and losing out on any big birthday/Christmas gifts until it's ""paid.""  After that there'd probably still be some cool down time (a couple weeks?) before getting it back.

If I had claimed that I just didn't know about internet safety like your daughter is, then getting internet back probably would have also come with other stipulations—since, by ""my"" own admission, I didn't know how to use the internet safely, then I'd have to deal with it being monitored/with parental controls until I proved I could handle it in practice."

I can't say about other houses, but growing up in mine, the reply to that would have been ""and that's exactly why you can't use the internet—if you don't know how to use it safely, you shouldn't be on it unsupervised.""

Then when I'd eventually be let on, there'd by tracking software and internet restrictions on any device I was allowed to use—because by my own admission, I didn't know how to use the internet safely, so they'd monitor me like a little kid."
