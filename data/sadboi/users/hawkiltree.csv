But he’s doing it to save Padmé and his mind has been poisoned to think the Jedi are evil. Between the movie and novelization, he thinks that after mustafar he’ll return to Palpatine (limbs attached) and begin to learn how to save Padmé. The only people he’s murdered at this point are the Jedi, younglings, and remaining CIS leaders. But he still believes he’s good, that he’s doing the right thing.

Narratively, though, I think it functions to heighten the contrast between pre and post fall Kylo.  It’s a familiar name, and safe and there’s a certain innocence about it.  Also virtuous because of the link to Kenobi.  Contrast that against Kylo Ren, a name that is unfamiliar/“foreign” and debatably sinister.  Kylo Ren is also a somewhat twisted/inverted version of the name Ben Solo, swapping out some soft consonants for hard ones and inverting the syllabic cadence (2/1 on Kylo vs 1/2 on Ben)."
