BreadTube,fovac0d,t1_fouipzh,1588097998.0,"As far as I've understood the North Korean regime is a totalitarian military regime that essentially needs the narrative that they are under threat to stay in power. The regime spends a massive proportion of their GDP on the military because the strict ""follow orders or be shot""-hierarchy of an army is the only way to maintain the current dysfunctional system. An outside threat is the only way to justify that. Because of this, the leadership of North Korea every now and then lashes out with random ""threats"" that South Korea and the U.S. needs to answer to. From the perspective of the regime, this is just theatre, and the U.S. military knows this. Counter-intuitively, not responding when NK lashes out could be more destabilizing for the regime, and an unpredictable North Korea is scarier to the U.S. than an oppressive North Korea.

Trumps comments about ""fire and fury"" played exactly into Kim Jong Uns hands (if you're conspiratorial, one could suspect that this was the deal to begin with, though I just think that's Trumps personality)"

From what I have heard from people like Steven Pinker one should be careful about extrapolating these positive trends into the future. As far as I have understood a lot of these trends are based on a global economic growth that is not sustainable long term, especially with the cost of climate change. When expected progress turns to stagnation politics deteriorate and revolutions happen. If not that, then at least more political gatekeeping. I mean a lot of the world seems to be turning pretty far right in the last few years. I don‚Äôt think the west will be treating the future climate refugees as ‚Äúnicely‚Äù as we do now.

But yeah I don‚Äôt know. I hope you‚Äôre right."
climatechange,eyqqwu9,t3_cy8j91,1567351218.0,"‚ÄùFood production and distribution is greatly dependent on policy; it is not an inexorable biophysical process. It is within our current capabilities to produce and distribute enough food for the 10 billion people who will likely be alive in 2100, if we reduce wastage, eat more plant-based foods, increase the efficiency of production, and ensure more equitable distribution. Climate disruptions will make this more challenging, but by no means impossible.‚Äù

Still, isn‚Äôt it a bit optimistic to believe that the world 2100 will be politically stable enough to enact these policies? We have starvation now, even though humanity technically make enough food (although largely with unsustainable methods). I don‚Äôt doubt that 6 billion is an exaggeration but I also think the would will be worse equipped to handle food insecurity..."
