dogs,fnn7x3q,t3_g2injh,1587086363.0,"If your dog was outside and then just came in to the shock of an unknown dog, that may have been the problem. I would read up on proper socialization, meet on leash in a neutral area, let your dog see you bring the puppy inside so he knows for sure that the puppy is welcome. It could've just been startled, but be careful because sometimes one bad first interaction can cause your dog to be aggressive to that dog later on. Also, make sure the puppy is HEAVILY socialized. Being attacked or just having a strong negative interaction can cause a puppy to be fearful and aggressive toward other dogs in the future."

dogs,fn5p72l,t3_fzbv1y,1586671293.0,"Idk if this was commented already, I didn't spend much time reading through! Does he have a crate? I would suggest getting a crate or any other space similar, so that he can have a designated place that is off limits to anyone else. His own personal safe space. I would also suggest getting a clicker for positive reinforcement training, click it and then give a treat immediately after, do this multiple times. After this, try some target training. Its very simple, just hold your hand out with a clicker and treat in the other hand, and if he touches your outstretched hand with his nose (even a sniff!), immediately click and give a treat. This will teach him that your hand means good things are coming! Give him lots of love and speak in a joyful voice, have patience, practice often, and he will understand. If he cowers when you try to pet, I would back off a little, hold your hand out for him to touch, and do the clicker and treat. A dog showing obvious signs of being scared and being pet anyway, can increase anxiety and show them that they don't have any control. Give him space and let things happen comfortably. A little bit of stress is okay, and will be a normal part of getting comfortable, but if he gets too stressed, let him go to his safe spot and just encourage him to come out with treats and a kind voice. I would have the kids help with clicker training as well, it might be a fun bonding experience for them and also would give your dog a sense of normalcy. The people he is more comfortable with are doing the same things you do! Good luck, and thank you for giving a traumatized dog a chance at a better life üíï."

So he continued to drive forklift, uncertified for a dollar less for 6 months!!! Didn't even realize til he got his pay stubs this year. He brought up the pay with them and they just took him off forklift. No compensation, no apology. He quit the same night and they sent him his last check with the WRONG NAME ON IT so however long they're closed is how long he can't get his last paycheck."

Story is good enough to make you cry, beautiful graphics, so much to explore. I beat it twice and still find things I hadn't discovered before when I go back to it. I recommend it to everyone."

I'll still have a job there when it opens back up, but no one knows when that will be. Hardly made any money yet, don't know how I'm gonna afford groceries or pay bills."
depression,fl387f7,t3_fltp8a,1584772408.0,"I feel the same things sometimes. I love my mom far too much though to be wishing something like that, it just makes me unbearably sad. So I switched to wishing that everyone in my family hated me so much that they moved to the opposite side of the globe with hopes of never seeing me again. Then I could kill myself and they could live on happily."
