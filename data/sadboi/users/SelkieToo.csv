 A poem that has helped me through grief before is: 

Do not stand at my grave and weep

By Mary Elizabeth Frye

Do not stand at my grave and weep  
I am not there; I do not sleep.  
I am a thousand winds that blow,  
I am the diamond glints on snow,  
I am the sun on ripened grain,  
I am the gentle autumn rain.  
When you awaken in the morning's hush  
I am the swift uplifting rush  
Of quiet birds in circled flight.   
I am the soft stars that shine at night.   
Do not stand at my grave and cry,   
I am not there; I did not die."

If I were near you I would raise a glass of wine to you or high five you (if it isn't too weird please do it yourself and imagine it's from me). 

I have a very young memory of lashing out at my Edad once when he told me off, but in an odd way it is a fond memory because I could work through those emotions and process them with him (I couldn't with Nmom). I think another poster wrote, that children will often lash out. I would go as far to as say that from my experience if they feel they can't, that is when it is most worrying. 

I've been learning about parenting through choices (any recommended books/links I'd be grateful), and what worries me the most is how I will react in a situation like this, when the emotions whell up. I know my Nmom's lashing out was linked to emotions she couldn't handle.
