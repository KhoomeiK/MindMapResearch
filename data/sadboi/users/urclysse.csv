In my case , a month after the fourth injection i experienced this weird balance issue (when i move ) that lasted one week and now i m experiencing the same thing after 2 or 2 months and half. The doctor said that its normal and i have to go through it with vestibular exercices and walking. 
I m worried cus i have a military thing that i have to go through for a month in order to get my diploma and i m afraid i wont be able to make it happen."

guitarlessons,ff6ftla,t3_errglo,1579626270.0,"The similarities in term of shapes is very helpful on guitar however, the ultimate level is to know sound as sound not as a fret or as a degree of a given key.

Ofc the only way to advance to this level is to start doing what you described as memorising intervals ( by shape and also sound ).

Its been 2 years that i m learning guitar by myself and i got the same light bubble moment you described.
I d advise you to check arpeggios of each degree in a major scale ( sorry i dont know the technical term) , check some jazz progressions ( 2 5 1 for ex ) , also variations and voicings in blues 1 4 5. I d also say try coming up with small lines and execute them.

Sorry for the long comment"

MonoHearing,ev289k1,t1_ev1dcoj,1564172222.0,"Hey, i hope things are going better for you. To update you on my situation, i have been having these vertigo attacks for the last 4 months on a weekly basis which sucked but these 2 last weeks were quiet. 

After i posted this , i v seen around 9 ENT in differents cities here , did MRI , balance tests and some ear ones too. It showed that my right inactive ear showed a balance imparaiment (idk if this is a word) of 40% which caused me a Positionnal Vertigo ( the kind of vertigo you get when u turn your head quickly).

So the disagnostic showed that i had Meniere disease which explains the vertigo attack but i didnt suffer from its other symptoms (Loud noise in the ear for ex).
Lately i went to see an ENT to get my ear injected with an antibiotic , its a kind of treatement for Meniere disease ( i invite to read of it , there is a subreddit too). This doctor noticed something odd in my tests and said that i had a rare condition called Delayed Vertigo or Post Traumatic Meniere Symptoms which is often developed in inactive ear due to an accident or another disease in the past and i m doing well since this diagnosis. 

I just wanna tell you that sometimes this vertigo thing affect your mind too and i know its so fucking hard and you just wanna sleep to not experience it, but u have to really keep a strong mind to fight it.

I hope you get well"
