I knew my mom didn‚Äôt like me exploring different sides of spirituality (I grew up Christian) so I tried to read tarot while in my room. One day, though it was very nice outdoors and I started shuffling the cards in my sunroom. She came in and got very upset saying she wouldn‚Äôt have devil worship in her home and that if she saw me with them again she‚Äôd burn my cards. I tried to explain that I was not channeling any bad spirits and this was just an avenue I was exploring but she was adamant.

Now when she does bible study in the kitchen (I know she won‚Äôt be coming into my room for a few hours)
I take my crystals, candles, and cards which I use as decorations and make a tiny tarot reading spot on my nightstand which can be quickly taken apart.

Im going to university next year and I‚Äôm so excited to have the freedom to choose what I believe:)"

A few seconds of the intro to the song played and I parked my car and unplugged my phone from the USB so I could watch the Snapchat video that I was sent. (if I didn‚Äôt unplug my phone there would be no audio) I got annoyed because it seemed my phone was connected to Bluetooth because ‚Äúkickstart my heart‚Äù was still playing but I realized the song was coming from the radio station that the car was last tuned into when I disconnected my phone.
