I think you mistook me wanting people to play their character instead with involvement and by the rules for wanting rogues to being singled out.

I'm just super sick of the player not using the manifold rules they get for sneak and instead just pointing at stuff without involvement."

I had been the one that was mostly always there since I had been in a lot of ldr. A lot of them had individually gone mia for a while after getting into new relationships and all that jazz but they suddenly made it out to be a problem and projected it on my new partner. Got to hear all the funny lines about abandoning friends for love as well. Meanwhile they had rarely made the effort to just text me first to begin a conversation. All it took was three months and they treated me like I wasn't really part of the group anymore.

The annoying (as in we as a couple are annoyed with us and not her) thing is that she's pretty disturbed from us catching her. We had to grab her by hand since nothing else really worked and since then she's even more shy in regards to movement. Beforehand we were able to nearly pet her outside. 
I'll hope she'll just forgive us at some point but I can't help feeling bad about it. On the other hand it's very cold outside and there's a lot of hunting dogs, foxes and even some wolves around so she's definitely safer here. She just doesn't know that.

Sucks but Amazon doesn't seem to understand that people pre-order their games to play them on release."
pokemon,f7808jb,t1_f775008,1573481655.0,I can only hope that that's a wild and unfounded rumour
NintendoSwitch,f72zv08,t3_du6y8n,1573385496.0,"The only feature that makes a new game appealing for a big part of the target audience is new Pokemon. If they stop the games might live on a while but the whole franchise would slowly come to a halt. 
They seem pretty afraid to crack the 1000 anyways because it will sound unreasonable but in the end I think they'll do it and it won't be that big of a deal."
GirlGamers,f72vaaa,t3_dtndj6,1573381646.0,"It looks amazing! I'm so excited for the games, already took the day off and planned the whole trip to the city to pick them up. 

 Anyone interested in exchanging friend codes for some Maxraids and trades once the game is out"
pokemon,f6z1yt5,t1_f6wb7jl,1573306763.0,"Let's be real, I wouldn't want to go to an event like this if the people I could meet are those that have been spending the last six months sending me death threats. 
Just think about being in that situation, it must suck a lot.

I'm super upset about dexit. I'm super critical and would love some proper debate. But I'm not gonna send anyone any kind of harassing message, not only isn't that gonna do anything it's also super unkind. Says more about those who do it then whatever the devs fucked up."
pokemon,f6yympu,t1_f6y9nc4,1573304076.0,"So first of all funny thing about your comment: I only knew that name ali-a from his girlfriends sims channel and thought he was kind of unimportant trying to get some of her followers to follow him as well. Guess it's not that way around. 

Anyways I fully agree, Adrive has always been someone who's way of producing content I absolutely disliked. I didn't care much but the way he's been about Sw/Sh is really obnoxious (and gets in my timeline often enough to actually annoy me)"
pokemon,f6yx4jj,t3_dti35i,1573302202.0,"Pokemon sells merch. The games are a by product that sells the merch and creates more of said merch, but in small numbers so it can be perfectly pushed out over the time of a generation. 
Once upon a time that was different but it hasn't been for a long time."
GirlGamers,f6whbt7,t3_dtf6pn,1573226576.0,"If you love Nintendo exclusives it's worth the money. All the other games are less frequently discounted than on other platforms so it's not worth it just for that. 
I love mine a lot, got it last year and played a lot. It got a bit dusty earlier this year when the PlayStation moved in but when I was bedridden for a while it more than restored it's worth."
pokemon,f6sy8wv,t1_f6qovf2,1573141414.0,I hate them because I really don't like the cashiers trying to pressure me into buying something else. I know it's not their fault and that they have to do  it but man it's annoying and I feel really uncomfortable during the whole thing.
nintendo,f6q2ag9,t1_f6pjrsf,1573069448.0,"Pokemon's rights aren't Nintendo's property or at least they don't own them alone, so there might licensing stuff. 
On the other hand it would be stupid not to cash in on the largest multimedia franchise with a park. It would sell itself."
dndnext,f6pen25,t1_f6pcr00,1573054632.0,I absolutely understand. Tbh I took me until level 4 of my clerics life span to understand that I couldn't just change them like that. Because they were 0 level spells right? You cast them like spells right? I feel so annoyed and vindicated at the same time by that cantrips are spells box in the document.
PokemonSwordAndShield,f6ospiz,t3_dsbkzr,1573032837.0,It looks amazing!
GirlGamers,f6os5zc,t3_drmpz2,1573031963.0,Not a game but get something to protect your screen from scratching! A small investment that will keep your switch and hopefully you happy for a long time.
