I have been working in a hospital for over a decade. Some deaths get to you. But most of them don’t. I can’t explain why. It’s the same for all medical staff. Most of the time you move on, but sometimes, for reasons you can’t explain, one stays with you for a long time. Do you deal with death at your workplace?

Not only that, but nurses are deeply cynical. Our nurses have been spit on, cussed at, punched, kicked and treated like serves by patients who act like they are 3 and not 50. They take a lot more abuse than most people can stand to keep people healthy. Do you get this at your workplace? 

Aren’t you smart enough take apart a media article, btw. They want you to be emotionally because then they get $$$. The reporter says she is devastated. Not the nurse. She is directly quoted as being overwhelmed. A patients is unstable, you are constantly putting on PPE, you have multiple patients beside this, wouldn’t you get overwhelmed too?

If you are too embarrassed how are you going to be able to speak up for yourself or someone else? You see something wrong, that you can change, but God forbid you are labeled as a Feminist. So you do nothing. 

It’s a way to keep the status quo on unequal terms. To keep some of the population on top with certain people under them. To keep somethings taboo. If something is taboo you leave it alone. Growing up in the 90s and 2000s, bring a Feminist was taboo. I did not think I needed it. Luckily I had some great people in my life that showed me that being a Feminist is not a dirty word.

mentalhealth,fndud86,t3_g15o9l,1586877658.0,"Yes. I moved away from my “best friends” a few years ago, but I didn’t come to my new city suddenly confident and ready for healthy relationships. 

It took a long time, therapy and new friends who do actually treat me well. I didn’t completely cut of all contact and one of my new friends pointed out once and for all how shitty they treat me. Finally, the main ringleader needed a place to stay and she continued to treat me like shit. But I finally stood up for myself and I can tell she hated it. It was awesome."

COVID19,fna7uvu,t1_fna31n1,1586792667.0,Are we sure? Social distancing is still very strong where I am. We are already starting to cancel large festivals and the Governor recommended canceling concerts and other larger gatherings. A lot of people are refusing to go to stores that do not provide/allow employees to were masks and gloves. The narrative I am seeing is still stay home unless you need to. There is large peer pressure to continue to shelter in place.

The winters have nothing to do. 

The summers are amazing. Multiple festivals every weekend, beautiful, public lakefront. So much greenspace put aside for resident. Our amazing food establishments have rooftops and seating in the back or on the sidewalk. Beaches have restaurants and bars. You can explore the city or go to the forest preserves. Fireworks over Navy Pier every Wednesday and Saturday all summer."
