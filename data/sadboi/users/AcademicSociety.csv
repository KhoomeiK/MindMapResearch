I can never find a peace in a world so cruel and so horrible. 

I've read about some Reddit user who never had a girlfriend, never had a first kiss, never had a real friend in life, always gave his everything in school, expecting something positive to happen in the future just to get diagnosed with a rare type of lung cancer - at the age of 27. The level of detail he provided about his diagnosis etc. made me realize that he wasn't lying.

Aside from a serious injury, I'm very healthy myself and everyone tells me to be happy that I'm healthy, but I know deep down that this could change at any time.

A suicide needs some proper planning if you’re planning to go somewhat peacefully. The widespread methods of hanging or jumping off a building are incredibly unreliable. There have been many people failing these attempts over the years. 

I read about some teenager who jumped off a multi story car park and he woke up in a hospital bed with severe pain that will follow him for the rest of his days. His spine and lower body was severely damaged so he’s now heavily disabled and longs for death even more."

There are definitely people with a bad life and there's enough evidence to prove it. The mere existence of some diseases proves my point to be honest.
