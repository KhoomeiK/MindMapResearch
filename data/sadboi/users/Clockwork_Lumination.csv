40kLore,fmcgvlg,t1_fmb4k4x,1585945420.0,"Thank you, that makes sense."
40kLore,fmcgtsd,t1_fmb2eay,1585945394.0,"That makes sense, and wouldn’t be entirely too far from reality in canon. I remember reading one of the Sisters of Battle novels (I think it was a snippet in one of the bigger books) where a small Sister squad is sent to a world that was cut off by a warp storm and found that their Servitors had become sentient and were praising the emperor. Something something it was a Tzeench plot by the humans and they used the sentient servitors as weapons blah blah, but the fact remains that is something they do. So if a convent were cut off because they were left for dead on Midgardia or something and they started indoctrinating local beliefs for a century or so, I could see them returning with their beliefs and, while being held deeply in suspicion, COULD be accepted because they are still Sororitas, as long as they remained pure of Heresy."
40kLore,fmcgauk,t1_fmbuoz9,1585945106.0,Thank you! This makes sense and kind of echoes what everyone else says. I think I can work with this to make it work for story. Thank you!

schizophrenia,f4j4err,t1_f4j1cm3,1571612977.0,"I agree completely, and honestly I bottle up everything as best I can while I’m at work. If I didn’t have to work I wouldn’t but I am suicidal (not feeling bad and going to kill myself, rather just my brain is predisposed to suicidal thoughts) especially without people around me.

schizophrenia,f4j0qb7,t1_f4j095y,1571611685.0,"I think the scariest  moments I experience are the moments where I feel utterly alone because I feel like no one understands my experience, and even if they did they would try to force something. I function okay in society, have friends and can hold down a job, but if the general populace knew the contents of my thoughts I am pretty sure they would try and commit me. The actual psychosis isn’t at all something that bothers me and doesn’t  really affect my life except the fact I don’t experience the world the same, and other little things like memory loss, paranoia and such which I can deal with with therapy and coping techniques."

schizophrenia,f4b02cb,t1_f4ax9w3,1571504425.0,"To clarify: of the medication I was given, all six of them made me extremely sick. Vomiting, vertigo, weakness, and a bunch of other things. So sadly I wasn’t able to really get a good idea of how I handled it on medication.

How often? Well hallucinations are fairly consistent. Usually I can just tune them to background noise, but every once in a while I’ll start being really aware of them, and that just becomes disconcerting.

The big episodes are usually sudden and I need to just close my eyes and let go past, like a storm. Usually it’s a flurry of images, or scenes. They don’t  usually /feel/ scary in the moment, though I’m sure by the descriptions others would disagree."

schizophrenia,f49diae,t3_djuydd,1571462977.0,"Also I should add that, unfortunately, my doctor prescribed me six different medications over the course of a year plus, and all of them made me terribly sick. So even if I did pursue a normal life, it would be without meds. Basically the life I am living now while living with schizophrenia"
schizophrenia,f49bm67,t3_djuydd,1571461554.0,"Thank you for your insightful viewpoint! I’m glad you found a way to work through what you fight and have brought yourself to a sense of peace. However I would stipulate that each one of our journeys is quite different.

When I was first diagnosed with schizophrenia, my therapist asked each question, and each time it was a resounding yes to if it was something I experienced. However as a follow up question, she asked if it bothered me that I saw these things, to which I replied: “no not especially.”

As someone who grew up with a multitude of other mental disorders, I never grew up knowing what focus was. It wasn’t until I was prescribed adderall that I even realized I had been missing out. So for me, I was raised in an environment that i guess favorably or unfavorably didn’t acknowledge it as a mental illness. 

I feel like I get a unique experience with schizophrenia, one few get to experience. I have a lot of coping mechanisms to handle it in ‘reality’. The coping is more the depression and anxiety that are byproducts of it and other things.

If i can create something others can enjoy with this life, rather than fight the river that is my madness, I relish the opportunity. 

To stipulate though, in no way am I endorsing following this path. It is my journey and I personally believe that if you and your doctor think fighting so that you return to a sense of ‘normalicy’ is the safer option, then that should be what you do. 

In the end, I am just glad to be here and to share my experience."

occult,evc2qkt,t1_etjhi2i,1564404527.0,"I have never personally had an issue with shadow people. They have honestly been nothing but kind and quiet no matter how I act towards them. When I was younger a specific one used to stand out on the street under a streetlight every night. Every once in a while I would go out and there would be a sort of waving, dancing, non verbal conversation we had. Always seemed friendly but never actually turned “light”

Other shadow people have been around watching however they have never disturbed me. More often than not they keep away people who are not good for me, and it’s honestly a sign that the people I’m talking to aren’t very open when they talk about moving shadows around where I’m living. Personally they have brought me comfort"
