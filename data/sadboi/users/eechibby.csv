I can also say this: a lot of people would like to help,, but they just simply don't know how. A lot of people simply just get fed up with it when they feel as if their approaches to this problem are proven to be ineffective or they feel as if it's not working. And some people just don't know what to say or do, making them run away or like someone else in this thread say: they're afraid of what they don't understand. I can imagine it can be some pretty hard shit to watch the person you love do a whole downwards spiral one month and then be the most manic motherfucker ever the next.

It makes people walk away from you  (Believe you me, I know about this one all too well). I don’t feel as if I can talk openly with my friends or my mom about it,, because they’ll want to throw me into an asylum the second I mention the word “bipolar”. The worst part about all this is is when you’re acting a little moody and your friends or your boyfriend asks “Did you take your meds today?” That’s the worst. Like am I not allowed to have normal teenage mood changes without you jumping down my throat about meds because I feel a little bit more happier than usual today?"

I’m not myself (even though I don’t truly know who that is),,, I don’t usually do things just for the hell of it, especially when it comes to sex or taking drugs.

I’m chubby and when I look around,, other girls don’t have stretch marks.. they don’t get made fun of for being pudgy.. they don’t know what it’s like to be the “ugly girl”.

I have thought about becoming bulimic,, I even starved myself for two weeks and then had to stop when I ended up at the hospital for it... but I just can’t bring myself to do it. I eat when I’m emotional and that’s just... all the time. I had a good workout plan going too. But then, when the places that I used as emotional outlets started to close, I’ve been cooped up in this house.. just eating my feelings away. Can’t really get my mind of my dysmorphia.. friends don’t really talk to me or I don’t let them talk to me because I secretly think they all hate me or something... so there’s truly no way to get my mind off it.

I don’t look like the models, actors, singers or whatever the hell you find on the media nowadays. I don’t fit into whatever society deems as “pretty”. 
Crap man... I don’t even care about school anymore. I spend more time and effort into applying my makeup than I do doing things that are actually *school*-related.

depression,exdv0ea,t3_csb5ng,1566187589.0,"I actually fucking felt this in my bones. I have a boyfriend currently and I usually keep my suicidal thoughts and actions to myself because I don’t want him to leave me when he figures out how hard dealing with a partner with severe depression and anxiety is.,, or you know,, when he finally realizes just how fucked in the head I truly am. I just... I don’t end up talking to him about the ails of my depression because I’m scared that he’ll up and leave me because of the mere fact that I require too much.. well everything. Usually every time I talk to him about my depression and my depressive episodes, or just feelings in general, I wish I hadn’t even opened my mouth afterwards. He expects change overnight. He thinks that since I had one good day, free of a depressive episode, that I am “cured”. He gets irritated when I talk about relapsing back into my old, destructive habits and it makes me feel guilty and discouraged. 

But my message to you is, when you have depression, it’s best to just focus on healing and getting back to trying to get to know yourself rather than have a relationship. If you feel like pursuing one, don’t feel down or beat yourself up when they don’t know how to respond to your mental illness, not everyone has experience with loving a depressed partner or experience dealing with depression. Also, if they really love you, they won’t feel burdened when you talk about your problems- they’ll listen and give an open shoulder to cry on and advice and encouragement when you need it.  They just might see past your depression and see you for you. Sure, your depression ails you, but it doesn’t hurt to try :). 
I hope this helped."

I used to be okay at it, but now I can’t even pick up a pencil without my brain saying horrible things before I can even put a mark on the page. “It won’t measure up to anyone else’s art” “You’re fucking horrible so why won’t you stop?” It sucks because just like you, I know I have potential, I am very self aware, I know I can excel at school if I put my mind too it, I know I’m smart but my brain says otherwise and my mental state keeps putting restrictions on what I feel I can do."

It’s no “Why are you feeling this way” or “What can I do to help”. But then, I start to think,,, 
She maybe really doesn’t know what to do in this situation, as a lot of parents don’t have formal training in what to do when a teenager is depressed/suicidal. They’re just as confused as we are when it comes to our feelings. It doesn’t feel good at all when your parents make *Y O U* feel guilty about having depression.

She had a huge fancy medical term but I forgot what she called it.  But sometimes, it is really hard. When you’ve been this way for such a long time... it’s like a habit. And habits are really hard to break. I keep falling into this thought pattern because it’s all I’ve ever known. I just... don’t want to give up but I just keep thinking that that’s the only option to truly... I don’t know,,, erase my problems."
