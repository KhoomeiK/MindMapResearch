raisedbynarcissists,fqald3i,t3_ghliqf,1589221027.0,"It pained me to even say happy mother‚Äôs day. My step dad and I got her a cake and he made us dinner. I thought that was enough. Apparently not. I told her this morning that I was tagging her in something she‚Äôd like and she was like ‚Äúa mother day‚Äôs post?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt do one this year as I figured about she is a nmom and emotionally abusive and i‚Äôve been having a fuck ton of issues accepting this. Depression, anger, etc. I didn‚Äôt feel like I had to do it. My response to her asking me why I didn‚Äôt give her a post was that I forgot bc I don‚Äôt want to be kicked out and i‚Äôm dependent on her. She said that she doesn‚Äôt feel loved and that just proved my fucking point. This is the hardest thing I have had to deal with. I hope this pandemic ends soon and that I can leave soon for my own sanity."

raisedbynarcissists,fpxrj11,t3_gg0avx,1588988113.0,"Yes, I am absolutely not looking forward to it this year. I have always known my mother is emotionally abusive but just recently, like last weekend recently, I figured out that she is narcissistic. While it made me feel validated that I have a term for what she has put me through, I have been grieving since last Sunday about not having the childhood I should have and not having a proper mother or the mother I thought I had. It has taken every fiber of my being to not lash out at her for all the pain and suffering she has caused me. Hell, she has contributed greatly to the personality disorder I have, the laundry list of other mental conditions I have and my suicide attempt when I was 18 (1 year ago). Sadly I am dependent on her financial and for my necessities so I have to keep holding my tongue and pretending like everything is ok. 

Going back to your question, yes I absolutely hate Mother‚Äôs Day. Whenever I am trying to watch TV, a commercial talking about ‚Äúlove‚Äù ‚Äúhow your mother is always there for you‚Äù etc comes on and instantly triggers me as I had none of that. I always had to be there for my mother since age 8 when she got divorced from my father. She made me her personal therapist. I had to put my own feelings aside and hear her talk shit about people I loved and cared about. My feelings didn‚Äôt matter. I had to put everyone else‚Äôs first. Then, when I finally put the pieces together that she was abusive after going off to college in another state, I ended up hitting a low spot and attempting. She was there for me at first but then would complain about having to drive me to therapy everyday, about the cost of the therapy and the hospital stays I had that you know HELPED ME LIVE... ugh. I‚Äôm sorry, this is all so raw for me and its been absolute hell trying to sit in this emotion and grieve about it all while having to live with her still and act like everything is okay."
raisedbynarcissists,fpujiii,t3_gfligl,1588914542.0,"I am also 19 and recently have come to the realization that my mother and stepfather are both narcissists. I can definitely relate to multiple things that you have included in this post that your nmom has said/done such as ""How did you suffer?"" ""You have no right to complain""  refusing to allow me the chance to earn my own money, subtly pressured me into med school, made me behave like a therapist towards her and forcing me to take sides in a very heated divorce and then got mad at me when I would defend my biological dad and would claim that she is ""always the bad guy."" 

I want to say that you are not alone in these horrible experiences and I am truly so sorry that you have had to deal with this. Parents, especially mothers are supposed to be nurturing and everything but harmful and abusive to their daughters and it is absolutely saddening that our mothers were not. We were robbed of a childhood and of mothers. If you made this realization recently like I did you will probably need some time to sit in your emotions and basically grieve the mother you never had. This is what I am doing at the moment and while it is super exhausting and depressing and painful, it must be done in order to take the next steps of recovery. 

You are extremely strong and from what you have shared seem extremely smart too. I wish you the best <3"

raisedbynarcissists,fpmtfs5,t3_gdku9g,1588741257.0,I have recently come to the realization that my mother is narcissistic and abusive. Things have always seem somewhat off when I compared my experiences with her to my friend‚Äôs parents growing up. But it took me going off to college in another state in fall of 2018 for me to realize her true colors. This led me to making an attempt on my life and that led me to being in DBT therapy with a laundry list of mental illnesses including BPD. This past week after my mom called me the r word for not reading her mind over something was when all of the realization of the abuse truly hit me. How the way she treats me is not healthy nor normal. How she did things purposely to make me dependent on her. And in 4 days I‚Äôm going to be forced to celebrate how wonderful of a mother she is and I have no where else to go bc of the pandemic and because i‚Äôm financially dependent on her. I need all the support I can get since it isn‚Äôt even mother‚Äôs day and i‚Äôm already three days in of a depressive episode and feeling numb almost all the time.
raisedbynarcissists,fpmqgsv,t3_ge6gip,1588739071.0,"I just want to validate you and say that for what you have been through, this is a totally normal response. As you said in your post, you probably got a flashback to your mom yelling at you and that is what caused you to get upset. I‚Äôm the same exact way when people are yelling at each other or when someone raises their voice at me or is even upset with me, and I suspect that that is because of the trauma and abuse my nmom put me through. You are not useless, you are a survivor ‚ù§Ô∏è"
raisedbynarcissists,fpmq1dv,t3_ge7ums,1588738768.0,"I relate to this so much. When I was in HS and wanted to get a job to have my own money my parents told me not to worry and to focus on my grades. Fast forward to now, me being a rising Junior in college, and I have barely any money to my name (I have a summer job but am trying to get a part time job during the school year too) and am basically fully dependent on my nmom and nstepdad for necessities and my college education. I am looking for a job but since I don‚Äôt have my permit anymore (due to it expiring) and I have to wait until the pandemic is over to get that renewed and then wait a year after that for my license. Basically what i‚Äôm trying to say is do not fall for what your parents are saying to you. I wouldn‚Äôt wish the feeling of being stuck in the same patterns of abuse I am feeling rn on anyone."
raisedbynarcissists,fpmpfam,t1_fpmbe6x,1588738331.0,thank you so much for your kind words and support. i really am in a bad spot right now and just reading your comment made me feel a little better and like i was seen. thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è

raisedbynarcissists,fnincac,t3_g1r5bl,1586982987.0,This is exactly what my nmom says to me... like giving me the basic necessities is your job??? Then since i‚Äôm 19 she is always saying she doesn‚Äôt have to provide me with these things anymore which in my opinion is so shitty.

RowanUniversity,f9rbtd1,t1_f9r9lii,1575574119.0,The last person who passed was two of my best friends roomate. They are not okay and it has been really hard for me too as I knew him and was friendly with him. I am absolutely outraged by the way this campus handles mental health and there needs to be a change.  how many people have to die for them to see that??
RowanUniversity,f9rbi8p,t1_f9r9lii,1575573991.0,"I totally agree. Rowan needs to do something. Idk what exactly but something. This is out of hand and for someone who attempted before, it is all so triggering. We, the student body, need proper mental health care and support."
RowanUniversity,f9r8eyh,t1_f9r7wfq,1575572735.0,its an app that alerts you about crime or other things that happen on campus. I just downloaded it and it seems pretty useful.

RowanUniversity,f1ybbv6,t3_db2568,1569813172.0,"I just transferred to Rowan this semester. I am a sophomore and my freshman year of university was horrendous. I started my freshman year at a school in Baltimore (3 hours away from my home, not the smartest move but I wanted to get away from NJ). I have suffered from COUNTLESS mental health issues since childhood and have dealt with a father who has severe mental illnesses. Basically, I didn‚Äôt finish my first semester as a freshman because I was contemplating attempted suicide and had to be rushed home to NJ. I withdrew from my university in Baltimore and was put in inpatient and outpatient therapy. I am grateful for this time I had as I was diagnosed with BPD which made me seem less crazy and less alone. Since most people do not know what BPD is, one of the symptoms is impulsivity and chronic suicidal idealization. So, when I was released from inpatient and outpatient, I took classes at a local community college and then transferred to Rowan. I have been doing a therapy called DBT to help me with my extreme emotions and symptoms of BPD and this required me to go to group therapy once a week for a year. I looked into Rowan‚Äôs group therapy for DBT and was shocked they even had something like this as my old university didn‚Äôt have long term therapy and made me walk a few blocks off campus to see a therapist. I thought Rowan has a decent mental health program but I am obviously incorrect. Mental health is a very important topic to me and my goal is to become a psychiatrist so that I can help people like me who suffer greatly from mental illnesses. I want to make mental health a common topic that people talk about and de-stigmatize  it. I am so sorry that you have dealt with all of this and I can honestly say that I have been in a similar place as you are. I am appalled at how horribly Rowan handled this and will make it a goal of mine, with my time here to make sure the school does something better to help the student body with their mental health. Stay strong <3"
