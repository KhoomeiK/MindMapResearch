socialwork,f5rkuqb,t3_doytza,1572396720.0,"Hey there, 

About 3 years ago in my junior year of my program I had to complete a role-play at the end of the semester demonstrating techniques that we had learned that semester. We got some basics on our client about 10 minutes before we were up to complete the role-play. A classmate of mine was the 'client' and my 'client' was a 15 year old girl who found out she was pregnant. I froze up about 3 minutes into the 10 minute roleplay. My professor, who was observing, had to give me a tip to get me started again. 

I was mortified. My other classmates had great role-plays that showed that they had learned a lot that semester. I froze up and sat in silence for 2 minutes of mine and felt like I looked like a total schmuck up there. I felt like I was going to be the worst social worker. I cried and cried in my professors office after class wondering if I needed to change my major. 

I ended up getting a C- on that assignment but you know what? A year and a half later I grew in my skills and graduated with my BSW. After that, I landed a job in my field. I still struggle time to time (mainly my awkwardness) but it gets better with time. You are still a student. There is a good amount of room for error still and time to grow in your career.

Long story short, don't beat yourself up too much over this. Take your mistakes and work on them. It's the best way to learn in this field. You'll be okay 😊

I had a English paper due the following morning that I didn't even start (and may I say, was never actually finished). 

I just remember going back to my apartment and trying to make coffee(notorious night coffee drinker) and I kept spilling everything. My other roommates parents were over for the weekend and pretty much watched the scene unfold. They knew I was baked."

I just get anxious, especially since I am technically a first time renter."
Adulting,evzty2h,t1_evzsym2,1564967198.0,Mine and I will be hitting two years the day we are projected to move in (early September). It's also part of the anxiety. Itll pass once we move in. Just worried that he will change his mind! Haha

entwives,evtef81,t1_evte8s4,1564768631.0,"I have a eucalyptus and spearmint one I burn all the time. It doesn't smell similar to my weed, but it's a STRONG scent. I'll try that. Also made a sploof out of a plastic herb-seasoning container. 

Hopefully it works!"

depression,evrcz7z,t3_ck913s,1564705740.0,"I get like this for like, 3 months every couple of years. I'm really depressed. I just wanna die. I barely eat. Productivity in the trash. I can't muster myself to do anything else but sleep and work. Then suddenly, I'm fine. I still have bouts of depression but nothing more than a day or two."
AskReddit,evqlee9,t1_evqjz65,1564694045.0,"Wasnt the first time I did that. But who knows, still something I think about and the group I was with was confused as to how I got so fucked up because I couldn't even stand. I have blacked out with much worse but was still able to stand up. 

Who knows. It was 6 years ago."
