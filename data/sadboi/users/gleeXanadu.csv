I would go ahead and wrap some foil around it or at least make sure you're storing it in the dark. Vitamin C serums like this break down in light. 

At this point you'll probably need to use around twice as much in order for it to be as effective is it would be clear. 

Once it turns orange or a darker yellow I would toss it because it won't be effective. It should still be active for now though, just use more."

You can do this! Switching to WFPB is the easiest way I've ever lost weight. I used to count calories, but I would end up losing and re-gaining the same 10 pounds over and over.

Now that I'm eating WFPB I feel like I can eat as much as I want and still lose weight. Please try it! You'll feel so much better, and if you're anything like me you'll start to feel curvier and cuter before you know it. I have way more energy too, and I feel healthy. I used to often get tired after eating, but since going WFPB I've only felt energized by meals.

Is there a way you two can work together to find dinners you could both enjoy that's WFPB? Maybe you could make him chicken and broccoli with potato, but you could eat black beans and broccoli with potato. Something like that. You could do a WFPB chili, and he can add sour cream and cheese to his but you can eat yours WFPB. You could do a whole grain pasta dish with greens, beans, mushrooms, and tomato sauce. If he wants he can add cheese and chicken.

Also, check out the youtube channel [Krocks in the Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pwBdo7dfh4)! They've lost a combined 290 lbs following Dr.Fuhrman's plan that I linked above.

For weight loss focus on foods that are nutrient dense, but low calorie. This includes things like veggies, fruit, and beans. Limit things like dried fruits, nuts, and seeds while you're losing weight. They're healthy, but they won't fill you up. 

If you have time, watch this video from Jeff Novick. [""How to eat more, weigh less, and live longer""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CdwWliv7Hg) He does a very thorough job of explaining how to eat to lose weight on WFPB.

Maybe there are some WFPB dinners you could both enjoy together. You could do your own thing for breakfast and lunch. That way she could have 2 meals per day when she can eat whatever she wants, and you can eat WFPB.

Examples of dinners you both might like are a pasta dish with a cauliflower bechamel or a tomato sauce and greens/mushrooms/beans. You could leave it the way it is, but she could add parmesan and chicken on top if she wanted. Similar thing with chili. You can make a WFPB chili you both like, but if she wanted she could add cheese and sour cream. Those are just some examples. Maybe try finding 5 or so dishes you can both agree on and start there.

Hopefully she supports you in this! I know sometimes people don't like changing what they eat, but if you work through it together and do it gradually then I think transitioning to WFPB is very doable. Good luck!"

He's a big proponent of IF for longevity in addition to exercise and a healthy diet focusing on produce. Lots of good information from him."
loseit,eztyw1q,t3_d2ax30,1568141738.0,"I don't think a bulk or a cut is in order per se. You've only been training two weeks, and you are correct that bulking will make you gain fat regardless of whether you also gain muscle. At 140 lbs and 5'6"" you're a good weight for your height, so I wouldn't cut either if I were you. 

Instead, I suggest that you continue to eat at maintenance calories and continue working out. Maybe a little above maintenance by about ~200 cal/day so you can be sure your body has what it needs to build lean muscle mass. You'll stay about the same weight, but your muscle mass will increase and your fat mass will decrease. People generally call this re-comping, because your weight will stay about the same but your muscle/fat composition will change. Over the next few months you'll notice that your stomach will become more defined and your muscles will be bigger. You'll stay about the same weight, but you'll be losing fat. You don't necessarily look like you have much fat to lose either. I bet if you continue on this program then you will see a noticeable difference in your stomach in the next 3 months, and a very big difference if you continue lifting for the next 6 months. After that you can re-asses whether you want to change your calorie intake.

Good luck!"

What's been working for me lately is to stop fixating on weight loss, and start focusing on healthy habits. The long term goal is healthy habits anyway, so why not start focusing on that now? 

Try re-framing the issue. It's not that you have a long way to go, and a lot of weight to lose. It's that you're developing healthy habits to last a lifetime. It doesn't matter how long it takes you to make it to a healthy body fat percentage, so long as you keep moving in the right direction.

Try fixating less on CICO, and focusing more on ways to make sustainable life changes. Find exercises you enjoy, healthy coping strategies (calling a friend instead of eating, petting dogs, relaxation techniques, etc.), focus on adding healthy foods to your day instead of limiting unhealthy ones. 

You may have a ways to go yet, but if you keep making a consistent and sustainable effort over the course of time you will be rewarded. You don't have to do it all at once! Slow and steady.

Plus, remember how great you're gonna feel if you keep going. You got this <3"

loseit,ezttlfy,t3_d22yll,1568138348.0,"I lost 15lbs earlier this year using CICO, then hit a rough spot and regained most of it. It took a lot of effort to get all those pounds off. I was doing a lot of exercise and was carefully watching every calorie, and was obsessing about my food and exercise. So it was really disappointing to re-gain so much of what I had lost.

Now however, I've been focusing on healthy habits. I don't have a scale at my place, so I don't obsess over the number on the scale daily. I'm just trusting that healthy habits will lead to positive change over the course of time.

Surprisingly, or maybe not surprisingly, I've had great results in the last month now that I've been focusing on healthy habits instead of just weight loss. I'm not necessarily tracking my calories, yet I am continuing to lose fat. My waist is getting smaller, my skin looks healthier, and I feel that I've made a sustainable change to my lifestyle.

So although I'm frustrated that I gained that weight back I feel good that I've managed to find a new and more sustainable way to not just lose weight, but to improve my health. Feels good.

I know that's not really a rant, just wanted to tell someone."
