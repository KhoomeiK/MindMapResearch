I promise you‚Äôre not being overly dramatic (my family used to tell me the same), I‚Äôd recommend asking them if you could visit a therapist or psychiatrist if you think they‚Äôd be willing to consider. I know it can be hard to ask, and if they say no, maybe ask other relatives that would be more likely to listen. I hope you can find a solution or something that can help ease the stress.

My psychiatrist told me that I could start taking it and then taper off of it once I‚Äôm feeling more stable, but for now I think I‚Äôm going to stick with it.
