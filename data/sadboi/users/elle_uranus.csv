houseplants,fr3w2jw,t3_gmierq,1589867900.0,"I collect books on houseplants, generally vintage ones* as they are usually more factual than the modern ones (which tend to be more focused on artwork than factual sources); vintage books are usually cheaper as well if you go to a secondhand book store or thrift shop. I also research via googling, typically collecting 3-10 sources per plant and check across all the sources for consistent facts and different opinions. Get as many (credible) sources as possible, as some plants grow and live differently in different parts of the world. On that note, make sure to check the native region for the plant, and look into what the weather conditions look like in that region to determine humidity, temperature, etc. It seems like a lot, but if you truely are interested in keeping your plant for it's maximum lifespan, it requires work. 

As you learn about individual plants, you will pick up basics on taking care of plants.

I would also recommend collecting info on: pests/bacteria/fungi (especially ones common to your area) that go after plants, different soil types and what goes into them, sanitizing soil and if you need to do it, pinching or pruning, different pots and their pros/cons, artificial versus natural lighting, different watering methods in relation to your specific plants, different fertilizers + homemade fertilizers, etc. For all this info I would recommend a plant journal to gather this info and refer back to. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, a lot of this info becomes second nature as you collect and grow plants, so don't feel like you need to memorize everything at once (again, the journal is great to refer back to when you get confused).

This is only part of what I have done and still do to learn about my plants. I would recommend checking Pinterest for ideas on how to organize a plant journal, as the ideas I have found there have been very useful. Remember, certain plants won't like where you live, and certain plants will just die. THAT'S OKAY! Keep pushing forward and learn from your mistakes (if possible)! 

*Beware: certain types of plants change families, and certain plants are new enough that they aren't even in books yet, so don't entirely rely on older books"
plantclinic,fo25v6f,t1_fo23tzf,1587450699.0,Yeah of course! Shoot me a message if you have any questions!
plantclinic,fnyg38k,t1_fnyfgcd,1587362044.0,"ALSO, be careful putting anything onto plant leaves (including soap, hydrogen peroxide, or rubbing alcohol). Anything that can coat a leaf can also kill it, as plants respirate through leaves (and other parts of the plant), basically exchanging gases and sometimes excreting water or taking in water through their stomata. Some plants are more sensitive than others as well; some plants won't show damage from coating the leaves (at least not for a while) whole others will respond almost immediately, like my ficus burgundy did when it almost died when I didn't rinse the leaves after treating them."
plantclinic,fnyfgcd,t1_fnyfcj0,1587361510.0,"Oh, and be gentle with the new leaves while rinsing! This method should work with new leaves as well, as the water can get into the wrinkles and kinks of the unfurling leaves to kill the mites."
plantclinic,fnyfcj0,t3_g4mrgw,1587361423.0,"I would cover the top of the soil with tinfoil/plastic wrap, and then bring it into the shower and use a hard spray on the foliage. Of course make sure you aren't damaging the leaves, but this kind of treatment will help knock some spider mites loose without having to use any treatment (also, covering the soil during this process will make sure you don't over water or get soil all over your bathroom). If you have a backyard/side yard you can try this outside with a hose or something similar. It won't necessarily get rid of the spider mites in one try, so try doing this every couple days for a few weeks possibly along with a gentle treatment. Make sure to be extra gentle with fragile plants, opting for a gentle rinse in the sink with a spray bottle or just the water from the tap. I've noticed a lot of times spider mites are attracted to plants with dry and/or dusty foliage, so doing this every week or so with all your plants will help prevent this problem in the future, and it provides a good time to water your plants as well."

I would recommend googling common pests for your ficus and with that information, look into the best way to go about getting rid of them.

houseplants,fmxgy2p,t1_fmxfed0,1586464788.0,Yep I second this! Just make sure if you are using the water method that you change the water regularly to make sure the plant has a better chance of not rotting.
plantclinic,fmxgs6t,t3_fxzukp,1586464700.0,"The general advice I give to people who are trying to root cuttings in water to transfer them to soil, is that once the roots reach around 1-2 inches long transfer the plant to soil. Since the roots are definitely longer than that (and the plant is very used to being in water), transferring the plant to soil is going to be tricky. If you were to put this plant directly into soil and try to water it like a regular houseplant, it would die from the shock of going from water-all-the-time to water sometimes. I would recommend mixing up soil that is pretty heavy on moisture holding components (peat moss, coco coir, etc.) with drainage to ensure root rot does not occur. For the drainage I would recommend cactus mix and orchid mix, aka bark with perlite and/or pumice plus some sand. Basically, the same soil mix you would use for an epiphytic plant plus some extra moisture retention and some sand added in (to help with root growth). As soon as you plant the cutting make sure the soil stays a bit more moist than a typical M. deliciosa soil, to start with, to help prevent shock. Slowly taper off the watering to a typical cycle over several weeks, and then eventually you can water it on a typical cycle. Please feel free to contact me for any questions!"

BipolarReddit,f6ag9wj,t1_f68q8ai,1572756462.0,"I get that, I really do. There are things I can't do anymore, there at people I cannot even talk to because I know I will get back into some things I shouldn't and I will become an angry and sad shell of myself who is rapidly cycling and suffering. I have physical limitations and sometimes I just cannot do things. I don't get to hang out with my friends most of the time because of my mood, or what they are going to do, etc. 

I think I am talking more about goals like going back to school; there are a lot of different ways to go back to school that can be integrated with having disorders of many kinds. You don't need to take three or more classes at once, maybe just take one. Managing your expectations does not mean you shouldn't shoot for certain goals, it means that you will achieve them differently, or in a longer period of time, or with a lot of help, etc. If there is something you really want to do there is a high chance you can do it, just differently and maybe not exactly the way you planned or wanted to.

And you are right, sometimes there are things you just cannot do. And that is fine too (even though it really sucks). As long as you can find something to do or set a manageable goal, it's worth it (it=living). Even doing the little things can be incredibly satisfying. I cooked dinner for my significant other and I tonight and cleaned some stuff and that is really good, because there was a time when I did not clean anything and really did not eat much and I don't like to remember the bad stuff, but I am achieving things that did not seem simple then."
BipolarReddit,f6aba8l,t1_f68m9nf,1572754458.0,"For example, at my college I have a disability center where you can send in official paperwork about your diagnosis. This means that if you miss class for a week, the professor can't just kick you out of the class, and you can get official notes from the classes you missed, etc. I finally did that, and it gives me the opportunity to use the tools and resources the school can provide, and because I have my paperwork in no one can tell me I don't need it or that I don't deserve the extra help. 
Another tool I use is my therapist. I can say all the stuff that is pent up inside to her that I do not want to tell anyone, or sometimes I can send her an email just to rant about surface level stuff. She provides (or reminds me of) different coping mechanisms, or talks about how I have gotten through similar situations, etc. (I also understand it can be incredibly difficult to get a therapist let alone one who gives a shit and knows what they are talking about, but it is fucking worth it to fight through the idiots to get to the right person).

I have other co-morbid disorders that make my life difficult (addiction related stuff, ADHD, eating disorder) and so I have a lot to navigate on a daily basis. I have noticed that dealing with my emotions is distinctly different from how my significant other deals with their emotional stuff. This includes having a mental breakdown after my boss criticized me (in a constructive way) and having to go outside, take my lunch, not have a panic attack, not eat for various reasons, and not leap out into the street behind my job and kill myself via a moving vehicle, all in 30 minutes (I don't see my co-workers doing this usually). I use a calming breathing pattern, I stretch, I mentally talk myself through what is going on to bother me (nothing and everything lmao) and go back to work. It has taken me most of my life to sort out my calming technique and it doesn't always work. Sometimes I end up self harming, sometimes I just need to crawl into bed and ride things out for a couple days, sometimes I yell at people and feel justified until a few days (or weeks) pass and I realize I was in the wrong and definitely hypomanic. 

I have done much worse things when I was younger and I am glad I have gotten better of taking care of myself, but obviously I'm not perfect. I am still working on actually filling out a mood chart consistently so that I can see how I am doing. I still self harm sometimes (whether physically hurting myself or drinking myself unconscious).

The best thing to remember is that even if you find something small to help yourself, it is still a step towards stability. And sometimes things that actually help you change overtime. There is no perfect solution to helping yourself."
BipolarReddit,f68nm1b,t1_f68mhei,1572730172.0,"My first year of college I got a 0.89 GPA and I tried to kill myself a few times while nearly drinking myself to death. I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly after that year and I thought I would never go back to college. I worked for a while and tried to go back again, only to reach a similar result. After that I worked to get a therapist and psychiatrist and got medicated, researched about tools to help myself from slithering back down. 

Finally, I got into some self paced courses this semester and I am actually hitting my goals. It is ROUGH. I hate struggling so much. But I am making it after working hard for a few years. If I could pull myself up out of that situation (amongst others who have come from worse things) I believe that you can do it to. Believing that you cannot do it is how you will never achieve anything."
BipolarReddit,f68kqpw,t3_dqqegk,1572729413.0,"Something that helped me with the drugs and alcohol bit was realizing (after taking some time off from doing either) that I was more stable without them. Yes, I do occasionally get drinks with friends, but I keep it minimal and prepare myself for the next few days (or weeks) to watch out for signs of not doing my greatest.

Honestly, being bipolar is not the end of the road. It is not going to stop you from achieving your goals. You will find a different way to get things done than people who are not bipolar, and that is okay. 

It will be a struggle, and even though I have been diagnosed for a couple years, I still get frustrated and upset that I have the diagnosis. I will have bad days or even bad weeks just being upset about being diagnosed, where I really cannot get myself out of a funk, and I have to work extra hard to turn myself around, but I do it and I use the tools around me to help myself.

I think the best thing I can say is that you have probably been dealing with the symptoms of bipolar disorder for a little while now (or a long while) and having the diagnosis just gives it a name, it doesn't change what you will experience.

There is a fine line on keeping the starts moist and rotting them, so I would recommend looking up some more directions online or messaging me directly about it."

But it should be noted that different birth controls work for different people (as with any meds for mental illness)"

bipolar,eujkhrb,t3_cgnjj3,1563873319.0,"Sometimes I just have to walk away (or even run away) from the situation if I can while I'm still somewhat lucid, and explain myself afterwards. I usually try to warn people ahead of time that I have 'issues with anger' if I trust them, so that if I suddenly dip out of a conversation they understand. When I am dealing with customers at the store I work at, I try to focus my anger into what I am doing or just smiling; I might look weird but at least I didn't freak out in front of someone who could affect my income."
plantclinic,euix3t6,t1_euiw382,1563857224.0,"Technically you should not, but if you check the moisture every day you can make it work. A moisture meter would help with that. It's super difficult to do with plants that don't love moisture though! So be careful and read up on your plants!"

plantclinic,euiw3cw,t3_cghaxx,1563856583.0,"Would recommend getting a moisture meter to check the soil as it is hard to get an accurate reading of all the layers just using your finger, this would help prevent root rot. I would also recommend terracotta pots for succulents, cacti, or any plants that don't like 'wet feet', as the terracotta is porous and will help keep moisture away from the roots by sucking some of it up!"
houseplants,ett1326,t3_cd46vg,1563161248.0,Usually due to overwatering or underwatering; I would recommend getting a moisture meter to check how your soil is holding water
