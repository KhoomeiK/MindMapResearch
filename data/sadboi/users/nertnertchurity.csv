I think it's an entirely different scale determining how someone is not smart: impulsivity or mental health issues. I feel oddly confident in saying that over 90% of the people I've ever met are smart. I'm not a psychologist and don't have a grasp on describing someone as ""they'll never go above a mental or emotional age of say 10 or 12"", I feel like I've never exactly met a person like this for myself even though I'm pretty sure I've been told I have.

I've been to countless rehabs and psychiatric hospitals though thankfully no jails. I've met a lot of people that, if they gave a shit, could turn their lives around to the point that people would see how bright they really are. In my opinion that is the correct perspective rather than an unfair comparison, promoting yourself as an einstein among us mere mortals. It's like the Jimmy Neutron sodium chloride moment."
