dating_advice,foefcyh,t3_g6th8g,1587702402.0,"Let me start with- I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going through this :( second of all, as much as it‚Äôs going to suck to hear this, I‚Äôm going to give you some big sister (I‚Äôm 24 hehe) advice. 1. I‚Äôm sure you really like him & you two have a lot of good memories together but you‚Äôre not going to convince anyone to be in a relationship with you. That‚Äôs something they have to do. You just sit there and be the best version of yourself. 2. You‚Äôre going to tell him you like him and where you stand & he needs to figure out where he stands & if he comes back with, hey I‚Äôve just hit a bump & things started slowing down for me etc etc but I don‚Äôt wanna let you go yet, okay- that‚Äôs okay because all relationships have ups & downs, talk- rebuild your relationship together. If your relationship wasn‚Äôt toxic, you can always rebuild. Do you think couples that have been together for 50 years loved each other every. Single. Day? Nope. We‚Äôre human. Take things slow and date, it‚Äôs fun! But if he just keeps making it clear that he really just doesn‚Äôt know anymore, I‚Äôm sorry but he‚Äôs mentally checked out :( and that doesn‚Äôt mean there is anything wrong with you!!!!!! It just means that this is how the universe is going to bring you something better. Again, I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going through this, it‚Äôs hard, every time. Tell him he needs to decide & in the meantime- don‚Äôt stalk him on any socials, don‚Äôt wait for him to reach out- if he does- cool, if he doesn‚Äôt- cool. You might have had an amazing year with this guy but you‚Äôve had 23 years with yourself. You need to look out for yourself, everything else will fall into place. Also, make a list of 20 things you love about yourself. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è"

dating_advice,foeb6o9,t3_g6w661,1587699765.0,"No, ofc not. People go through things & maybe she‚Äôs not comfortable telling you yet. You obviously seem to like this girl, I wouldn‚Äôt just end things over her being distant. Text her letting her know you‚Äôve noticed she‚Äôs been distant and if she‚Äôs going through something, you‚Äôll try your best to be there for her because you care about her and if she‚Äôs being distant because she feels something is off between the two of y‚Äôall, to have a conversation with you and not string you along. Whatever it is, let her know that you‚Äôre willing to talk about it because it‚Äôs putting you in a place where you‚Äôre questioning your self worth. If she says something has been bothering her- family, work, mental health- try your best to be there for her & respect her space whenever she ask for it. If she says she‚Äôs losing feelings/feels scared about yalls future- don‚Äôt undermine her feelings, let her know where you stand but ultimately love yourself enough to remove yourself from the situation because you don‚Äôt deserve a half assed relationship. Good luck! I recently went through something like this & it gets better, I promise. Things always work out for the best. You just really have to love yourself and remember to respect the other person & their feelings so no one gets hurt."

I also have pale legs and dark hair so what I did was 1. Fake tanned my legs- the color makes my legs look healthier and doesn‚Äôt make the dark hair stand out as much. And then I grew out my hair a little and waxed it- this really pulled the dark hairs out of its pore and make the appearance of strawberry look better. & also while I was growing my hair out- I exfoliated every single day- with an exfoliating glove and any Walmart body scrub- also keep your legs moisturized- this is think makes the pore size smaller- and and and remember to love and accept yourself! I go through this & I know how annoying it is! But remember when we accept ourselves and our flaws- other people have no choice but too. :) good luck!

dating_advice,exmzopr,t3_ctheuj,1566442949.0,"So sometimes after a relationship it may not be smart to jump right in to another one. Take some time to recover and internalize this feeling that you felt. Try to channel the negativity through another means either through a new hobby or working out or anything that will help you grow physically and or emotionally. Sometimes the worse thing you can do is jump right into another relationship and have that lingering negativity from the old relationship hurt you. Always remember that you don't want to bleed on someone else when you've really been cut by another person. In terms of looking for another person- Life is hard and teaches us alot and sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith. If you run into someone that really loves and that you really love, you have to have faith and just jump in. But in order to develop that you have to get over and accept what happened with your previous relationship"

relationship_advice,ewqxqwd,t3_cpj9qz,1565684417.0,"For starters, I‚Äôm giving you a big hug and sending positive vibes your way. A very wise lady said to me once ‚Äúif I let my age define me, I wouldn‚Äôt have accomplished half the things I have.‚Äù  This lady basically accomplished all the things she wanted to and became the best version of herself in her 50s and she‚Äôs thriving. She‚Äôs finally accomplishing things that people accomplish in their 20s but she‚Äôs not letting that discourage her or stop her from celebrating. You might not get there at the same time everyone else does, but when your time is right you‚Äôll get there because everyone is on their own timeline. Also, I think it‚Äôs very important that you focus right now on filling yourself with all the love in the world. Accepting your body and where you currently are. Because you can‚Äôt love with a cup that‚Äôs only half full. Decide today that the person that needs the most love is you and the only person that can provide the love is also you. Once you start loving yourself you‚Äôll start seeing the world differently. Also it‚Äôs very important for mothers to love and accept themselves bc children pick up these habits! I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm insecure about my body just like my mom is. Age isn‚Äôt a limit, you sound like a beautiful mother and women and I have no doubt all the most best things are going to come to you. But first love and accept yourself unconditionally so when a good thing comes, you can recognize it and when a bad thing comes (like your ex husband) you can get rid of it from a mile away. Also I‚Äôm really sorry for the long post, just wanted you to know you‚Äôre not alone. Also oneeee more thing. When a sales person goes to sell their product to a very successful businessman he/she doesn‚Äôt doubt their product. The sales man is very confident that no matter how successful the businessman is, he/she needs his/her product. That this product is PERFECT despite it‚Äôs shortcomings. You‚Äôre the product you‚Äôre selling to potential guys. Love yourself so they can see that and in return love you back. 

Best vibes ‚ù§Ô∏è"

offmychest,esnmhxc,t3_c8k6gc,1562138790.0,"Listen to me, you're going through a shitty time right now but you're going to keep working that shitty job until you save enough shitty money in our shitty currency and move out and you're not going to be defined by who your parents are, you're one day going to be defined by how all of this shittiness didn't consume and define you. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT OUT AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE. KEEP WORKING UNTIL YOU DO. I promise, you've made it so far, just a little longer until things aren't so shitty."
offmychest,esnm214,t3_c8kvnn,1562138187.0,"I feel this really deeply. I'm 24 with no job, I also miss being in a relationship, and I deeply miss my grandma who recently passed away. I'm sorry you feel this way :/ but remember, you deserve love too. Be gentle with yourself, we don't all get there at a certain time, we get places when its our time. And you'll get where you're meant to be. As for a relationship, work on yourself hard enough and love yourself because the person you're dating will only love you as much as you love yourself. And as much as I do the same thing to myself- telling myself I'm being overdramatic, this post is helping me realize that's wrong. Our feelings are just as valid as someone else's. You're not being overdramatic, you're hurting. Nurture yourself because you're important too."
