NTA - You don't have to do anything you don't want to, you didn't ask for this and the kid isn't your responsibility.

YTA - Just because you didn't ask for this doesn't give you a right to be rude about/towards the toddler. This isn't the childs fault. It's the moms. So grow up and take it up with the mom. Stop being rude about the kid regardless if it is your responsibility or not. Also, most toddlers throw tantrums because.. well.. they are a toddler. What do you expect? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
