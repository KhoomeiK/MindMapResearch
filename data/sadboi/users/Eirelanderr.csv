But the executives wanted changes, POI complied and suddenly Shaw was dumped on the audience (a Mary Sue btw) the team went suddenly from Finch, Reese, Carter and Fusco to Finch, Reese, Shaw, Root and Fusco. They went from 4 unique people trying to help everyday people using an unfathomably powerful, yet ethical AI. To 5 people fighting a secret war between dueling computer programs.

And the audience bailed.   (nielsen.com)

If they originally pitched this later concept to executives it wouldn't last a season on the syfy channel.

POI was infected, the last few seasons were watching a once vital, exciting show fight desperately against cancerous executive meddling.

I think they did a good job with what they were told to work with in the final season, but they lost the heart of the show a couple of seasons before that."

Catholic writers Gaitley has very good ""retreat"" books that are very good. Chesterton is good, but can be so dense in content that it may not be great for those weary in spirit.

Reflections by father Leo Clifford are a book and video series that offer 7 minute sermons that are very soothing, uplifting and encouraging. That can be especially good when a weary mind can only bear so much in terms of preaching or even thoughts.

Don't discount music as a remedy. Musician are inspired by the good news and there are numerous composers who convey the pain, comfort and resounding hope just in song.

Think of the two thieves at the cross at Calvary.

I am sinner that means my actions break the commandments, God's love, endanger my salvation, etc. 

I go to confession because I admit that I have fallen short, repeat I have fallen, strayed, rejected, offended God. And in confession God gives me absolution so I can continue to war with all my vices again.

And I lose, again and again.

And God forgives me, again and again.

But the one thing that is crystal clear is this. I am always in the wrong when I sin.

The danger this poster is in, the danger I am strongly telling them to reexamine is their perspective on sin as described by the church.

The post was laden with talking points, modern rhetoric and it was all bullshit. I gleaned more about what the poster wanted by the phrase ""sex before marriage"" than anything else. They wanted to have sex before marriage and they didn't want to think about how they grew up, studied and once believed it was wrong. Couch that view with troubles in the church and other issues and viola a rationalized ""argument"" about staying in the church.

The translation of the post is ""I want to fuck x and/or y and the church is the only thing in the world saying no and I hate that because if they stopped then may be I wouldn't feel guilty about it deep down in my soul.""

That viewpoint is dangerous because it cuts a person from God entirely. They choose their justification over the virtues, the sacraments and their salvation.

On the surface both the thief and the good thief did the same horrible deeds, the good thief may have even done far worse, but the difference is the good thief realized the truth of his actions while the other REFUSED to.

So when I hear someone whose ""theological"" disagreement is nothing more thin attempt to justify sinful behavior I call em out on it. They are refusing to realize the truth of their actions.

And yes, the truth can alienate people, it can hurt, but it doesn't change the reality that it is the truth. And sooner or later we all have to face it."

The 4th point of the sex abuse scandals in the clergy is simple because it is not part of the faith. It's an evil we could discuss ad nauseum, but for this person's post it didn't really fit the overall argument.

The 3rd point is similar to the 4th but without the scandal attached. The Church has long establish why it has only male priests.

In short the two last points were insincere additions to mask the real point that the person doesn't want to be reminded of the fact that their actions (and that's what it's really about) are sinful and would rather the church adopt the current trends of the world than preach the truth."
