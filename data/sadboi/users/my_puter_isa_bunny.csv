It takes weeks to kick in but going another six months unmedicated, especially when you're rapid cycling, sounds miserable. 

With my health insurance, half the doctor's offices in the area aren't even aware that most of their services are fully covered for me. Take the time to write down a list of offices and their numbers and just go through, calling each one to see if you're covered.

If this really doesn't work, do you have any voluntary inpatient mental health hospitals around? Some insurances have separate coverage for inpatient hospital days (I have like 140 per year) so you may be able to check yourself in (always, always do voluntary) and have a few days to go over which meds are likely to work best and to get started. A little group therapy and some time off work don't hurt either.

Being medicated is tolerable. Being unpredictably manic and depressed nearly killed me. A few times.

I guess yoga and spin were the most helpful at greatly reducing stress. Wearing myself out with cardio every day and having a consistent wake-up time helped my sleep 100%.

BipolarSOs,ewp05eh,t3_cpe2ie,1565630557.0,"This is, again, not related to bipolar. You're just doing what people in a relationship do. Not everything is about your diagnosis."
BipolarReddit,ewm9nd8,t3_coywt6,1565546411.0,"Watch the dosage and get frequent blood tests. I won't touch lithium because of a terrible experience involving severely high doses (which led to temporary blindness, thanks doc)."
BPD,ewkhdg3,t3_cokbap,1565484460.0,"What you're describing is called failure, everybody feels it when they mess up, it's not your BPD, its you feeling a normal human emotion. Not everything is BPD. It's not ""weird satisfaction"" unless you enjoy messing up your life and probably the lives of those around you."
relationship_advice,ewkfk8p,t3_convlc,1565483076.0,"Erm, not to be obvious, but your mom was having sex with two guys at once. Without a DNA test, how are you even sure about this? Freaking out and trying to ruin your possible father's life was a bit childish, BTW; no wonder he told you to leave him alone.

You and mommy need to have a talk."
