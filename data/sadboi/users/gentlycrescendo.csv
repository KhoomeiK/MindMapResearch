piercing,fqocefu,t1_fqnns52,1589512124.0,They mean take it out permanently.
piercing,fqoc9uj,t1_fqobwhh,1589512048.0,Yes. Possibly go to a professional piercer and get it looked at when things open up because it looks like it was pierced incorrectly to begin with and that may be causing your problems. And if it is a real infection you need to take it seriously and go to a doctor.
piercing,fqobokj,t1_fqob0hb,1589511682.0,You shouldn't take it out especially if its infected. It cant drain and the infection can get trapped in there. If it is really infected you need to go to a doctor.
piercing,fqoae2a,t1_fqo8pud,1589510899.0,You are not supposed to take it out at all when its healing. Just letting you know.
piercing,fqo4scd,t1_fqo03nt,1589507557.0,You're irritating it more by taking it out over and over
piercing,fqnrqz6,t3_gjvrs0,1589500175.0,Stop taking it out.

piercing,fpxwyj5,t1_fpxw7io,1588991281.0,"My best advice is to stop touching it, make sure she isnt sleeping on them either. If thing persist I would visit a piercer in person once thing open up and get a professional opinion"
piercing,fpxwqpu,t1_fpxvbag,1588991150.0,Spray saline and rinse in the shower I know its frustrating to still see gunk on there but the crudites might be connected to newly formed tissue
piercing,fpxumkt,t3_gg6l3j,1588989909.0,Drop the ointment and q tips
piercing,fpxsbf7,t1_fpxs7c9,1588988570.0,Try a new piercer because they don't know what they're talking about.either way I'm letting you know it's the wrong jewelry regardless of how common it is. Good luck pal
piercing,fpxs8ua,t3_gg2zdu,1588988528.0,No not all balls and bars are universal
piercing,fpxrocd,t3_gg4z9l,1588988201.0,It has inappropriate jewelry and has a high risk of rejecting just so you know. You need a surface bar not a curved barbell
piercing,fpxrgxk,t3_gg5yaq,1588988081.0,You shouldn't be taking them out to clean if they arent healed
piercing,fpv4smb,t3_gfqv3w,1588934889.0,Yes
piercing,fpjkmqa,t1_fpjji4v,1588672074.0,Try showering after you use wound wash that way the salt doesnt stick around and irritate it further. But yeah that bar is way to long you need to downsize asap. Try a different piercer while you're at it because that jewelry is so wrong for this piercing
piercing,fpjgbdg,t1_fpjf3nq,1588667428.0,Do you mean vertical labret?
piercing,fpie3tw,t1_fpidya1,1588639022.0,Yeah I do. Daiths are one of the harder piercings to heal they are finicky and prone to irritation bumps.

piercing,fox7qo6,t1_fox79rc,1588136178.0,Keloids dont pop friend that's why I thought it was irritation
piercing,fox71no,t3_ga2z3w,1588135673.0,If it is infected the only thing that can help you is a doctor and a prescription of antibiotics that's your only choice. True infections are serious and need a professional to be addressed.

piercing,fol6108,t3_g7zuty,1587855573.0,A ring with a captive opal would be to die for in your rook
piercing,fol5oom,t3_g816o7,1587855384.0,"The piercing was about a 4 but putting the jewelry in hurt a lot more because I have a teeny ear so my piercer had to man handle me a bit lol, mine isnt healed yet so I cant comment more than that but it doesnt get in the way of earbuds at all. Does even touch them."
piercing,fol4xlm,t3_g82s5w,1587854964.0,"The smaller gauge probably wont be a problem unless you're already at 16g. 18g isnt ideal because it can reject more easily and it can cut through skin if caught. It's called the cheese cutter effect, nasty stuff. Also the problem with bowflex is it isnt really suitable for long term wear because plastic is porous. You might be stuck with a bitchy conch but I dont think making these changes would help since the issue is that it doesnt like to be slept on aka it doesnt like pressure. My best advice is to get a travel pillow and put your ear in the hole when you sleep. :("
piercing,foifd40,t3_g7220r,1587785347.0,They look properly placed. Alternatively I think your anatomy isnt symmetrical

piercing,fmzzjvn,t3_fya3km,1586532658.0,It might be because this piercing is terrible for the health of your tongue because it pins two muscles together. Also be careful in the future. People with this piercing end up with really fucked up chipped teeth.
piercing,fmwlsgx,t3_fxjcq1,1586448870.0,My conch will not have it and my rook which is relatively fresh still aches when you touch the back of the ear so it sucks all around for me.
piercing,fmtrm8h,t3_fxb75u,1586377804.0,You should really take it out. Its digging into your flat and can cause bad scaring if you dont take it out now. You dont have time to wait for a piercer.

piercing,fjloa40,t1_fjlo607,1583450732.0,Yeah you should take that as a sign it's not good for the health of your tongue. Venoms look cooler in my opinion anyway and you get the same effect.
