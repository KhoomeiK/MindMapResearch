lonely,fqw3244,t3_gl82lf,1589691466.0,"I just want to say I'm sorry over how you feel and how many lonely people say they're lonely  but yet a lot us dint have the audacity to reply back. The truth is texting doesnt really fulfill anyone in the way when it comes to talking with people in person unless you're using facetime with them. 

There was a russian guy I once talked with but we couldn't take much over time difference and we managed to talk once on the phone but then he texted me saying that he would rather not talk to me because I was uninteresting with him even though he hardly responded at all much because he was busy, I didn't even have the feeling of just reasoning with him about it, and i understood how he felt but he was a little too quick to judge to be honest. Even then I found him and approached him in this subreddit, I mean what did a guy like him think he was going to find in this place? Interesting people that fly allover the world, go on vacations to 5 start hotel resorts? I mean I as far as I know, there isn't really a lot of lonely people that do that often. But at least he didn't ghost and told me about it so I can't be too mad at him.

I talked with this phillipine woman that was living somewhat of a nomadic lifestyle throughout the midwest, we talked for a month and then one day she ghosts me, not that I noticed initially, I mean we all have other things to do, i get that but I noticed that she never replied back like ever. I was so lonely but I also couldn't be mad because she either ghosted me because she lost interest and found me boring, or her boyfriend probably got jealous and told her not to text me, I mean not that I was even trying to say her off her feet at all. But like you, and every other use out there who has been ghosted, we will never ever know. 

I could tell you also about how a Danish man said that he would talk with me again but never did which I found pretty funny, then about how, there was some Romanian kid that was there yet never responded because he was all he was looking for were memes, lol. Even then there is currently like a not even a handful of people o even talk with much, who knows how long before they ghost me too, and for some reason a lot of girls get hesitant to reply  when I talk with them, I mean I just wanted a friend, I wasnt asking for marriage, or a date, or anything. But there is nothing I can do because in the end its thier descicion. 

And then last but not least there was this so called british woman, that I wanted to talk with as a friend to get to know with, she or if she even was a she at all, tried to scam me. She refused to do face chat at all with capital ""NOs"" everytime I asked, she kept hinting about how she needed money, and then I needed up ghosting her when she claimed that her account was hacked and need funds for her mother and wanted to do something for me on the internet. 

Also I dont care if anyone in the subreddit even responds to this at all I honestly feel like this subreddit is like my high school, more than adults for the sake the of not wanting to be alone and have someone to talk to which I do not get much, other than how they dont want to be alone and beg about wanting friends,or love or whatever else, and yet dont respond much once I or someone e slese tried to contact them and they never respond, and on top of that I remember seeing  2 suicided good bye posts here which are me sad. This isn't a feel good comment other than admitting that o do genouinlry feel bad for you OP because this comment is just something I also want to get off my chest as well. 


I never had a good social life, and so times piss people off without wanting too, maybe I'm doing that now, b regardless I still strive to make friends because being lonely can ruin our lives and will make us less likely to succeed in life the way we all as children have dreamed of. But then again this is something I want to get off my chest for this sub over how I feel lately."

lonely,fqs0ip7,t3_gjzjeo,1589595861.0,"This is just my opinion but from what I remember especially me being a lonely man myself, a lot of us with poor social skills, and a history of not having many friends over whatever reason that may be, and not having much association with a lot of people, for SO long, of course we would DEARLY crave for a love partner in our lives. But that itself will be hard for us because aside from that being lonely will mean that we will be less likely to get a job and if we do much less a raise, we cannot be getting a partner for us to love and take care of. 

Sorry for giving a lesson, and for probably sounding like a snob as well, but if you want a partner in life, the only way to do that is to start socializing and I'm not trying to sound very bossy or demanding, not like I'm actually there wherever it is you're at. 

Unless you happen to find someone who is lonely like you and happne to hit it off then good for you and forget the world! But I'm only saying that si ce I think unless there are others that can say and comfort people better which they obviously can. I'm trying to fo all of this just to get out if the hope I am in and I thought maybe I can share something that is scary but valuable.

I only made acquaintances and no real friends, I ended up being lonely when the real friends I had moved into other states  and cities. I also had an abusive father really though he would get somewhat physical with me he was more manipulative than anything. 

I wanted to make friends and dreamed of having some, like what you would see in TV when you're a kid watching your favorite show with the main characters and all of his/her friends.
