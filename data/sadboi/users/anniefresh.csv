I imagine when someone's (people, dogs, cats, etc.) jaw is so clearly misaligned, the issue isn't isolated to a couple of teeth. Like when people get braces, the orthodontist doesn't only correct the placement of one or two teeth, they realign the whole jaw in addition to those certain teeth.

I'm not an expert, just a thought. Either way, as long as the pup is happy and healthy, I'm good :)"

MadeMeSmile,ffad7j5,t1_ff9hc5e,1579732785.0,"This is not about penny\* pinching. It's about a mutually beneficial economical arrangement between a company and a worker. There are pros and cons to being either an FTE or a contractor.  Contractors are paid much higher hourly rates than FTEs, and they are eligible for overtime. FTEs don't get these higher pay rates, but they do get things like health insurance and paid time off. Sure, in most cases, being a full-time employee is the preferred option, but for many, this is not the case.

I will also add that WM pays both its employees and its contractors wages that are competitive with the market, and in many cases the best in the industry. Further, WM's corporate culture is the best I have seen (and I've worked for multiple publicly traded and Fortune 500 companies).

And to clarify, the reason this is seen as an accomplishment is not about cost, it's about establishing the employment relationship as a more permanent one. Most contract positions are seen as temporary, whether for a project with a defined end date, or a job that typically sees a lot of turnover. Once the company sees that the employee brings more to the table than the guys/gals that are just passing through, they want to formalize the employment relationship. Like the difference between living together and getting married. Each has its benefits, but one is a lot more permanent.

I hope that helps."

MadeMeSmile,ff9h6gy,t1_ff9cptr,1579712933.0,"WM has a LOT of contractors. Further, it is typical at WM for people to join as contractors/temps, and after a period of several months or in some cases even after a year or more, to be added on as full-time employees. This shift from contractor to FTE is not guaranteed and is seen as a pretty significant accomplishment.

This is by far the best comment I have ever read on Reddit. Thank you kind friend."
BipolarReddit,eyilltp,t3_cx4o53,1567104090.0,"(All of this is from my experience dealing with Bipolar I over the past several years.)

First, take a deep breath. then a couple more.

Then, call your doctor and explain your symptoms. Don't stop taking any of your meds.

Next, go for a walk or exercise. This will help you get some of that intense energy out of your system. 

Avoid caffeine or other stimulants, they'll just amplify things.

Stay away from alcohol as much as possible. The combination of impulsivity from mania and the lowered inhibitions from alcohol can definitely make you make choices you'll end up regretting.

And let your family/support system know that you're at risk of making risky/unhealthy decisions.

I hope you get everything figured out!"
