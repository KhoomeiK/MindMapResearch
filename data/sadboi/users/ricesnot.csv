Or go through the small entrance meant for chickens. I flashed a light in there to check if anything was going on and found this backpack. A day later I grabbed the bag from the coop finding it covered in dust.

Upon opening the bag I found horse brushes which were made in Germany, even the name of the brush was German nothing was written in English on these brushes, there were a few. I found a card that was for someone's mother, the name signed is illegible, whoever signed it was young and couldn't write their name well. 

A little blanket, seems to be hand made was also found in the bag. 

We do not have any children on our property, and I live in a small country town where the nearest neighbor is not close. I know one of my neighbors has young boys, but I haven't seen any daughter. I did a search in my county for missing children reports but nothing came up. This was a little girls backpack though, and it's gathered a lot of dust.

UPDATE: after thinking it over I have decided to take the bag to our local sheriff's I don't think much will come of it in our small remote town, but I thought just in case. I won't be going through it anymore for pictures sorry guys. If anything comes of it I'll let you know."

Almost all the men where I am from are privileged and if you're not fighting to change that dynamic so both men and women are treated equally and with respect in society, then to me you're a trash man.

Having the stance not all men excuses those who don't even participate in trying to change the system. And to me that sucks. All men should be allies to women there is no excuse. Men need to tell other men what's up. Sad thing is on reddit which is mostly male, the female perspective gets lost easily or told to shut up. 

Women only spaces on reddit get raided, or the posters get harassing DMs. Myself included. No one outside those spaces talks about that, the countless young girls on here who receive dick pictures from men, or even just any woman.

Or how in life as a woman society teaches you to put everyone before yourself, to be understanding, to take the punches and move on. Because not all men.
