1. Formatting. I know you're on mobile, but just letting you know, separating into paragraphs helps a LOT.
2. Put dialogue in it's own paragraph. Press the enter key for each new dialogue piece.
3. Try to keep it a tad more organized. Everything was kind of mushed together and it wasn't too clear.
4. Lastly, your tone in it. There's nothing wrong with it, but just saying: it was really up and down. Tell your story in a calmer tone.

ChoosingBeggars,euylwe0,t3_ch7zef,1564104785.0,"This happened with a friend of mine---but it was like this:

Her mom was pregnant(8 months) with her and she was talking about how excited she was with another pregnant(also about 8 months) friend of hers. She mentioned how she wanted her daughter's name to be ""\_\_\_\_"" and apparently the friend's mom face formed into a face of shock and she said, word for word, ""But-but that's what *I* wanted to name my baby! You can't do that! Also, my baby would be a boy and yours is a girl!""(it was a gender-neutral name)

Obviously, my friend's mom was kinda confused, and she said, ""Um... that doesn't really matter? ""\_\_\_\_"" is a really common name and my baby won't be the only one with that name besides your child. Also, ""\_\_\_\_"" is a gender-neutral name. I don't understand the big deal here.""

I'm just gonna do dialogue from here(keep in mind this was told by my friend, which is told by me, so it's a little changed)

""\*\*scoff\*\*! Even if there are already born children, that doesn't mean you should use ""\_\_\_\_"" too!""  


""Okay, you're being really unreasonable here, -----. It doesn't matter if our kids have the same name! Knowing kids, they're probably going to think it's cool!""  


""Don't you understand! This is an act of courtesy!""

""I should be demanding this of you, shouldn't I? After all, I'm closer to 9 months than you are! And all those kids with the name ""\_\_\_\_""? Why don't they demand YOU to use another name!""

&#x200B;

After that, the friend of her mom was kinda speechless, so she muttered something like ""gotta go"" and just left. Apparently, the other woman kept texting her and harassing her. She just blocked her.

Currently, they are friends again but she REFUSES to apologize, so things are kinda awkward between them."
