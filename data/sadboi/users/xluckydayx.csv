I would say SPR is a great Americanized Version of the War.

The best movies about WW2 are mostly foreign as they endured the horrors much longer and translate the feeling of ""well fuck everything about this."" Better. 

Come and See.
Stalingrad
Europa Europa
Das Boot

All do far better in terms of leaving the audience with a feeling that war is pointless choas. Some of the best WW2 movies are Eastern European or German. Americans always gotta have a winner in their movies and war has none in reality. Though I do love SPR and all of its technical achievements it still bugs me as someone who wishes war movies weren't so ""Hollywoodized"" and depicted reality better. That way people realize an individual soldier living through battle can mostly come down to luck. War is mostly boredom with moments of pure choas. 

Still reccomend watching SPR so that people can compare an American version of War to Foreign films in the same genre.  I appreciate SPR and all its glory but its still a bit romanticized for me personally. Then again I'm also a pretty harsh critic of films as film/tv is one of my biggest hobbies and Spielberg is one of my love/hate directors.


Fun fact: the village at the end of the movie was created in a field in england from ground up. It is used for every village scene in the movie. The Rainy day sniper village and the end fight are both shot in the same place.

Actually spend the 4 years between runs to fix mistakes and prepare for the next one. No commercial breaks.  Spend like the 5, 6 or even 12 hours getting through all the questions.  Since, ya know, it's part of their jobs...

This is one of the very few times we get to actually use the peoples democratic powers and its stuck behind profit and monopolization of the parties. Ratings are more important then democracy to our media. 

And for God's sake, the media at the very least has to act like it's a fair race. I mean look who qualified for the next debates...everyone who was center stage during each prior debate. Such blatant manipulation is so annoying because we dont pay attention to how shady the whole thing even after 2016."

Same shit different position in society."

Are people Really not worried about mass surveillance, blacksites, facial recognition, encroaching police state, super polarization of the political parties and a world that is becoming ever more unstable with climate change looming in the background?

Gun laws today will have a longer reaching effect that could end terribly in the future and to not consider the amount of negatives further down the road in order to make life pleasant today is just a bad call.

Everything that has been done well by an AAA gaming company in the last decade has been taken from user made mods and smaller independents who get eaten up. The reason they stopped letting us have mods is because they realized users were making better games with the same tools and giving it out for free.  They are killing any meaningful artistic venture into the industry by focusing on wealth and shareholders litterally do not have enough brain power to understand chracter, plot or game mechanics.  Gaming is the new movie industry and they are turning it to shit faster then we can handle."
