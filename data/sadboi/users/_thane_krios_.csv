DogCare,fnw4v80,t1_fnw41ir,1587311478.0,"Unless your dog is very allergic to fleas, usually it takes a fair few of them to get to the amount of discomfort you’re describing your dog as having.

DogCare,fnw3ls8,t3_g483l7,1587310750.0,"I know you said it's probably not fleas, but here's some tips on checking -- fleas like to hang out on the warmest parts of the body. So you're most likely to find them in their tummy/sanitary areas, especially in the early stages of an infestation. Luckily, these are usually the areas with the thinnest fur. So definitely roll him over and check there, down by his lower tummy, his boy parts, and the inside of his back legs. Fleas also HATE water -- I see you said you ordered some oatmeal shampoo, so when you do give pup that bath, this is also a good time to keep your eyes peeled. The fleas are going to run to the ends of the hair to attempt to get away from the water and will be much more visible. 

Edit:You can also look into Capstar if you want to be absolutely sure he doesn't have fleas. It's a pill that will kill all the fleas *currently on his body*, though it will not prevent new ones from jumping on. 

I'm a dog groomer. Realistically, if your dog is itching so badly that you're finding clumps of hair and a multitude of hot spots all over, my guess would be there's an underlying problem that an oatmeal bath isn't going to fix. It may give him some relief for a few days so give it a shot, but I'd be calling the vet if it were me."

There’s lot of muscles in there you likely aren’t used to using.

So I would be tense and slamming everything shut in there and then couldn’t figure out how to get those muscles to relax. Even now when I’m with my boyfriend and I haven’t had enough warm up time I occasionally have to actively think about relaxing and make a conscious effort. It’s normal. 

I don’t know how to describe how it’s done, perhaps someone else can better. For me, it was just an experience thing. It may take some practice but try to spend some time learning where the controls are for those muscles in to brain and body and try to relax them if you can. Came with practice for me.

doggrooming,flza7c6,t1_flz8vrq,1585618964.0,"As an addendum, cause it's looking like you have a lot of questions about brushes, what you want is a slicker brush AND a comb. [Slicker brush](https://www.amazon.com/Millers-Forge-Stainless-Designer-Grooming/dp/B001NLVFH2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=8AERTE3IZLCA&keywords=doggyman+slicker+brush&qid=1585618583&sprefix=mr.+robot%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-3) goes first -- you want to brush in layers to make sure that all the hairs are separated all the way to the skin.  If you don't see the skin when you're brushing, you're not getting down to it. When I say brush ""in layers,"" I'm referring to a technique called ""line brushing."" [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRmsuoe6z6s&t=135s) is a tutorial video on line brushing; this video is specifically about double coated coats, which is not what your dog has, but it is essentially the same technique -- use your hands to separate the hair into layers and brush one layer at a time Once you have separated all the hairs, you'll want to go behind and redo the same areas with a [comb](https://www.amazon.com/Andis-2-Inch-Steel-Comb-65730/dp/B004UTDHP2/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=grooming+comb&qid=1585618642&sr=8-5). The comb is the test -- if you can put a comb's teeth all the way to the dog's skin and pull out, that means there is no matting. 

As another commenter said, the key is a table -- cuddle time is for cuddling, grooming time is for grooming. We very often see owners bring their dogs back in and there's one beautifully brushed strip right down the dogs back because they were brushing their dog in their lap while they were lounging on the couch. Meanwhile, the dog's undercarriage, rump, and legs are completely matted. If your dog is used to grooming, the table will also indicate to your dog that it is now time for grooming and help continue that training, as well as help indicate to your dog what the expectations are. Set your dog upright on a table and make brushing its own activity.

The 4-pack is about $7 and these are super soft and gentle (and also really easy to clean). I found out pretty dang quick that I was actually leaving way more makeup on my face at the end of the day than I thought when I was just using my fingers to wash my face. I also mix squalene oil in my face moisturizer in the evening and that's helped keep my moisture balance a little closer to where I'd like it to be."

I’m late 20s and broke up last spring with a guy I’d been with for quite a few years. We had a dog together. We’re still very amicable and even though the agreement was that its “my” dog post breakup , she still goes on frequent visits to his house. He just picked her up yesterday because I’m about to start finals and could use the help. 

I dunno. I guess I could see why it might make some people uncomfortable. I don’t personally get it, but I can see it. But I agree with you— if you can be amicable why the hell would you cut someone out just because it’s convention? It doesn’t have to be that way."

I am definitely the type of person who doesn't put or actively hides a LOT of the stuff I'm tagged in on my social media profile. It honestly does not matter who tags me in it. I have my relationship status hidden on facebook. I don't let photos people tag me in on other people's feed. It has absolutely, zero, nothing to do with whether or not I want people to know my boyfriend exists. It has absolutely everything to do with the fact that I don't use social media for everyone to know everything about my life. I don't... honestly think everyone NEEDS to know who my boyfriend is. My personal life isn't anyone's business but mine. Doesn't mean that I'm hiding he exists or I'm not proud of him. It just means I'm a private person. And I don't need or want a paper trail of my entire personal life on the internet. 

Maybe have a frank conversation with him about how this makes you feel rather than jumping to conclusions based on something that, honestly, I think is pretty innocuous"

I say this because I tried every over the counter drug store acne treatment on the market, because I didn't understand my skin or why I was breaking out. Turns out, I break out because I have chronically dehydrated skin and throwing drying acne medications on on top of that is a sure fire way to give you the worst break out of your life. And then cause you're breaking out, you add harsher treatments. So you break out more. So you throw more crap on. And it just gets worse. Took me months to figure out my error. 

Look into what kind of breakouts you have/where/why and that will help guide your decisions."

As someone who's currently in an incredibly rough semester of school (20 credit hours + working 20 hours a week + an internship + prepping a law school application + a relationship) this is what I gotta do right now to get where I need to go. I appreciate more than anything that my boyfriend is very flexible on what nights we hang out and staying in instead of going out. He's supportive and cares about me and always stresses that we can hang out another time if I need to focus on school and he makes it known that he wants me to have a good balance. But I've had more than one person suggest to me that I scale back when honestly... I'm doing just fine. I'm doing more than fine. I'm tired, but I'm happy. And to be honest, when people nag me to slow down I find it *ultra* patronizing.

BikiniBottomTwitter,f2ku4oj,t1_f2kh21w,1570289291.0,"Not OP but this is kind of my wheelhouse, so: 

The US incarcerates more people than any other nation in the world, and the rate of incarceration has risen from about 200,000 in 1972 to 2.2 million today. We make up 5% of the world's population but 21% of it's prisoners [link](https://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/#targetText=Between%201980%20and%202015%2C%20the,21%25%20of%20the%20world's%20prisoners.). This also counts only current incarceration and does not take into account those still under some kind of criminal justice control like probation, parole, or post release control. Of those 2.2. million, 540,000 are being held in pretrial detention: over half a million people are being incarcerated awaiting their trial and have therefore not even been convicted yet [link](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2019.html).

The sharp rise in incarceration has been led largely by a) the drug war and b) ""tough on crime"" policies that began in the 1970s (these include things like mandatory minimum sentencing, three strikes laws, etc.). While crime rates have been steadily declining since the 90s, our incarceration rate has continued to rise exponentially due to these ""tough on crime policies"" which have been shown by numerous studies to be largely ineffectual at preventing crime. This sharp increase in incarceration has caused extreme financial and economic strain on our infrastructure as well as producing more felons who, once rereleased to society, find themselves restricted from jobs and housing and face overall difficulty becoming functional members of society again (and thus the cycle continues). 

So it's not just about who is or is not falsely accused. It's about why the US continues to incarcerate at a rate that is completely unprecedented in world history despite the fact that crime rates do not justify the rising incarceration rate. There are a number of very good reasons why we should be paying attention to the incarceration rate as a whole-- I've touched on very few of them here."

DogCare,f163vqh,t3_d7x6g9,1569201979.0,"Groomer here. 

Welcome to it. Shedding is part of the Duke-package. You're not going to eliminate it, just manage it from here on out. 

Regular grooming is going to be a major help to you (personally, I don't think groomers should offer a ""deshedding package"" and I myself would be suspicious of those that do as they should just always deshed a dog correctly because that's part of a proper groom. But I digress as that's more of a personal gripe about my industry). Getting Duke on a 6-8 week schedule is going to be best. DO NOT shave him -- it's not going to help with the shedding and could in fact damage his coat permanently. 

Don't purchase a furminator. They are far too expensive and they're damaging to the coat. A slicker or a pin brush should be used to break up and separate the coat and a comb used to make sure that all undercoat is pulled out. I would suggested looking up line brushing ([here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRmsuoe6z6s) a good tutorial) and do this in between grooms to help manage undercoat. You could also look into an undercoat rake (a favorite tool of mine), but this tool should *not* be used on a daily basis as it is hard on the skin -- again, I would search for tutorials on youtube, they're plentiful. 

Feel free to PM me if you have questions."
