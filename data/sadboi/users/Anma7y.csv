workingmoms,fqs91uj,t3_gkd2p4,1589601271.0,"I've worked from home for about 8 years. I'm a regional manager with about 20 people working on my team. My husband lost 40%of his hour at work and is now working from.  And I'm supposed homeeschool my 10 year old, while making a sure the house is managed. My husband has never managed another person, but surely with your extra 4 hours a day to help. Oh then to find out he's maxed on vacation,  meanwhile every spring, winter, and summer, I've had to manage my workload and mom load to make sure everybody is taken care of. I also do the after-school pick up, often sitting on a conference call at the same time. Not one of my friends have jobs and do not understand the pressure involved and so I can't even vent to them because I don't want them to feel in anyway negative or chance they feel judged by me."
Bakersfield,fqpik1b,t1_fqpftt7,1589547262.0,"No worries. Also know, the job Market was slow prior to Covid and it's really bad now. Medical is also one of my issues.

I travel to St. Louis a lot. From your perspective, the weather will be so nice and you will be awstruck by the natural beauty that surrounds us. On the rare occasion I dive over the hill into LA, I am always in love with the scenery. And when the flowers bloom along the grapevine, it turns hillsides into the coolest shade of orange that seems to change color as you drive by.

One other thing, there are times the highway going to close due to flooding/mudslides, snow, or fog.

It is the Midwest of California here, but still California."
Bakersfield,fqp5nfh,t3_gk3qzq,1589535898.0,"I live just west of the 99 in the sw and I would suggest go north/northwest. The crime and homeless population are moving in from the east of 99. People are getting their cars broken into, strangers ringing their doorbells in the middle of the night pretending to need help, but rejecting offers to call the police, really just a set up or scope out. I hear sirens every night. Pretty much all night. You can hear cars racing up and down ming. Mostly Thursday through the weekend, but some weeks it's more. The mall is not great. I've worked in 8 malls in 2 states and this is the lowest end I've been in sans Antelope Valley mall (they win for the sharps box in the restrooms) . Not to mention the occasional incidents at the mall, sometimes resulting in not allowing teenagers in or people getting hurt. Many shootings. 

There is an app where you can listen to the police dispatch radio. Just search the app store.

Elementary and high schools are decent, middle schools aren't good at all.

SW has a large sports center/fields that's is very nice. As you move North and West it gets newer and quieter. More typical suburban communities.

There are more new restaurants popping up all the time, but as of now there is no Cheesecake Factory or other typical chain restaurants you find in most larger cities.

It is one of the most conservative cities in California.

Spring and Fall are short lived, but beautiful. Sometimes it's less than a week. Then very hot summers, which I like, but makes the electricity crazy high. Winter is mostly mild. Cold, but nothing extreme.

We are in a valley and the biggest industries are agriculture and oil/gas. We are also part desert and get occasional haboobs. Pollution is a huge issue because of these things. It's also very dusty here. Outside table canstantly have a layer of dust. Inside collects more dust than anywhere else I've lived.

The people are pretty nice. I've never had a passing smile of acknowledgement rejected. I don't go out much, but for those who I know who do usually have a neighborhood spot they regular, but you can run the gambit of bars and entertainment pretty quickly.

It's easy to get around here. 20 minutes from one end of the city to the other.

This has been my experience in the last 5 years. I'm a middle aged adult. It's an easy way to get into California and figure out where best suits you. The coolest thing about California is you can get anything you want (mountains, beach, culture, etc.) in between 1and 4 hours. Vegas is 4 and half hours, depending on how you drive. San Francisco is a bit longer, like 7 hours from BK.

Most people here like country music. There are not a lot of radio station options. The city has roots stemming from Oklahoma. 

OH, there's no high end dining. No matter how the restaurant is touted, you can get in anywhere, in jeans. Very casual city in that respect. 

It's not my favorite city, but it allows me to live comfortably in the state I grew up in and be nearer to family."
