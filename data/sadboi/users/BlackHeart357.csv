askteenboys,fr291nr,t1_fqzleuq,1589833236.0,"So in my understanding, a hebephile is PRIMARILY attracted to teenagers, although I don't buy that 17 is a rational cutoff, since the age of consent is lower in many countries around the world. BUT, if the person is older and is still primarily attracted to people that age, then I guess it would fit. There's some nuance I guess.

Yeah, it's not as weird as 30, but they're still a lot of years apart. Like, a lot of development happens from 13 to 19, both physically and just maturity-wise. I think the biggest issue is probably the power balance between the two. That she may be looking to take advantage of a kid because she has a sort of ""authority"" over him. That's where it could get really bad in OP's situation."
askteenboys,fr28kvg,t1_fqzfkia,1589833006.0,"Pedophiles, by definition, are attracted to prepubescent children. A pedo literally would not find a 13 year old attractive. Maybe if they were a late bloomer, I don't know.

It's basic evolutionary psychology, dude. Plus this doesn't pass basic scrutiny. You're 16, so what, 10th grade, maybe just into 11th? You're going to tell me that you haven't found ANY of the girls a grade or two below you attractive? You're lying.

I'll put it to you this way. Back when I was 19 and in my second year of college, there was a girl in one of my classes who I started talking to. Now, she didn't look all that much younger than me, like she was just out of high school maybe. But I came to find out she was actually 16 and was getting a head start on college taking a couple courses at night (since she didn't get into any college credit courses in high school).

I'm not going to lie, it was clear she was attracted to me, and I definitely became attracted to her. Could I have taken advantage of her? Absolutely. But I didn't. She was mature in some ways, but even compared to me just three years older, she still seemed like a kid. I just didn't think it was appropriate for either of us. I'm not sure what the legality would have been in NY, but keep in mind that in most countries around the world, she was not only the age of consent, but PAST it. My opinion would not have been different even if it were legal."

It gets pretty nuts when you consider that in blind tests, apparently men actually preferred girls who were underage to their older counterparts when they weren't told their age. I think Tim Pool talked about this recently. I guess it's sort of like, ""Well, they're ready for reproduction and they have the highest chance of producing healthy offspring"". I suppose it was like that in the old days.

Honestly, I think everyone's found someone who's underage attractive. The issue really is acting on it. It's not like she's 19 and he's 17 and like yeah, that may be illegal, but no rational person would bat an eye at that.

It would not matter what you knew. Because they're under 18, they literally cannot consent, regardless of what you believed their age to be. But there are some exceptions. First, where within a certain year range, a person under 18 can consent to someone over 18 and it's a non-issue. 

Other states do allow some defense to make room for someone reasonably mistaking their age. As in, ""she looked well over age of consent, we were in a club where you needed to show an ID and be 21 to get in"". I'm not sure on the outcomes of those kinds of cases though."

It's a work in progress, but it's hard to feel too sorry for someone who hasn't taken any steps to change what's bothering them. Reminds me of a girl I used to know.

What do you mean the right to ""consume"" over the right of actual live conscious people? What are you even talking about?

You know how insane you sound when you say they're all white supremacists? Just like the white supremacists that went to the Virginia rally? Oh... The media selectively hid the dozens of minorities there standing side by side with all those ""scary white separatist militia assholes"". Now why would they do that? You tell me why. I'm waiting. 

Okay cool, so why don't you go over to those guys, tell them your concerns and how you want them to stand for certain things like cancelling debt. Or better yet, exercise your own rights and go and do an armed demonstration yourself provided it's legal. I actually have respect for the guy who went to storm the ICE facility. Do I think he was a moron, and that he couldn't even do that right, and immediately got taken out? Yes to all of those. But I respect that he at least was fine with the risk that he wasn't coming back from what he was going to do. I thought he was an idiot, but he was a brave idiot. So if you don't like what they're fighting for, go and stand side by side with them. And how would you feel if someone told you that you were ""just another white supremacist militia asshole""? By the way, there are quite a few far left pro-gun groups who demonstrate as well, so that doesn't even hold up. You're just making ad hominem attacks on people who you disagree with, without addressing what they're talking about. 

Okay, so what is this new amazing system you'd have in mind? Because right now we don't even have capitalism. It's crony capitalism. For example, look at the FDA. Not them as an organization, but all the pay to play SHITE that goes on. ""WHY AM I PAYING SO MUCH FOR INSULIN!?""

""Well Darlene, it's because the government determines the ability of a company to produce insulin, and they've only given permission to 4 companies which collude to keep prices massive."" (I picked that name out of nowhere btw, Darlene isn't real lmao).

Hell, if you and I put all our differences aside right now, started producing insulin, and then attempted to sell it and undercut the other four, we'd be thrown in the fuckin' slammer. So when people talk about how messed up capitalism is, they don't realize that we don't even have a free market. And so they want to tear all that down. But the problem is, simply going back to reasonable regulation, rather than government overseeing so much about our lives is a much easier fix, and one worth trying. Rather than largely moving over to another or different or hybrid system. We have basically the worst of both because we're in a weird in-between. Based on history, I think capitalism with basic government protections and taxes and so on is what incentivizes all the innovation we see. That goes for healthcare costs, it goes for a lot of other stuff as well. I'm just going off your point of benefiting the people, and it what I think would be an easier way rather than tearing shit down. 

Look, there's a lot of shit I don't like that needs to be changed. The kind of shit that Google does, you know ""We're totally NOT an American company, so we'll have our HQ in a tax haven, even though we definitely are an American company."" But the truth is, why wouldn't they do that? They'd be dumb not to if they can. So things like that need to change. Hell, I'd lower taxes in a lot of ways, but try to keep all that money in the U.S. economy, rather than allowing loopholes like that.

Who's debt is going to be cancelled though? If you went to college for $100,000 for a degree in gender studies and can't pay your loan, like I don't know what the fuck you think I'm going to do for you. I would support some things though. For example, NO ONE should be making the minimum payment on a loan and owe MORE money afterwards. So freezing interest and things like that, I might be able to be convinced on. 

I was talking about education cost with someone the other day in fact. Consider you're going to Harvard. You're going to pay them a metric crap ton of money. Most will I mean. How the FUCK is it that they make all this money on tuition, and then have their hands out to the government for BILLIONS of dollars? If you go back in time, government funding was lower IIRC, and cost accounting for inflation was ALSO lower. Seems like the more money we've given them, the less they've had to compete. If a business can't compete on it's own, let it die. I think both sides get this wrong depending on what they value. Like the airlines... ""Oh, you spent money irresponsibly buying back your own stock and never saved for a rainy day or something going wrong? Fuck you. See ya."" So... It depends.

I'm probably one of the few guys here that is very conservative but also largely libertarian. I was trying to explain to her that incels and the blackpill ideas are more on the left, because they look at a sort of inherent flaw in the game where you have a few mega-winners, some people in the middle, and then a large portion at the bottom are complete losers. And so the idea would be to attempt to sort of tip that scale so it becomes more balanced.

But even as a conservative, I don't think it's crazy inconsistent to believe that either. Because as a conservative, I believe far more in equal opportunity than equal outcome, which is not what my pursuit is. As a conservative, I'm saying that there is NOT equal opportunity in the dating game, and that's the issue. Hopefully I've articulated myself fairly well.

Anyway, she couldn't even begin to wrap her head around this. She said, ""NO. MANY INCELS ARE BASICALLY ALT-RIGHT AND THE ONLY REASON THEY ALIGN WITH THE LEFT IS BECAUSE MANY ARE NOT WHITE, OTHERWISE THEY'D BE REPUBLICANS BUT REPUBLICANS HATE THEM!!

They're peaceably going about their day and having a fun time with their children and have government agents with guns coming to arrest them. The issue is not even that. Not at its core.

When people see the protests in places like Michigan, they're alarmed. And while I also am not a huge fan of the optics of open carrying rifles on their chests, apparently they can do it legally and they aren't hurting anyone. You at least have to understand the reasoning, even if you disagree. I'll say it like this:

""You guys don't have the authority to do the things you're doing. We're going to protest. We won't start a fight, but violate your oath to the constitution and the people of this country, and we will at least have the means to finish the fight if need be. So here we are.""

You didn't even bother to address the things I said. Apparently they just started rationing meat today. I mentioned that if this goes on too long, there could legitimately be riots for food. It'll all be fine, until one day there's nothing on the shelf and stores say ""Well... We don't have any more trucks coming with those things. Guess that's it.""

Hell, I'd take it anyway, but again, to remove someone's freedoms if they don't? It's a real possibility that won't happen, but then will happen all at once.

I'm not a conspiracy guy. But as I said in my previous reply, we as citizens DO have a duty to keep ourselves and our community safe as best we can. But we also need to remain highly vigilant of government overreach. And for the government to not just *recommend* that people close up shop, or maybe implement some seating distance requirements (or whatever), they're essentially saying ""If you do open up, we will literally send men with guns to take you away.""

And what if they did find blonde, blue-eyed white women most attractive? What then? Or they could throw society for a loop and find some other group more attractive. It may also be based on how they (the hypothetical aliens) look. We just don't know.

I think you need to read between the lines of what you said, and why I said you were contradicting yourself. Calling me an idiot doesn't mean you're smart as a result. 

She may, or may not. ""It depends"". Women often refuse to look at their looksmatch too, so that means nothing. Just anecdotes and we can argue about that all day and get nowhere."
AskTruFemcels,fpe5j8j,t1_fpcs777,1588540769.0,"Don't you think that we both believe what we believe because of our life experience, and that the truth is probably somewhere in the middle? We're all shallow pricks. That's a fact. But if what you say is true, again, how can that OKCupid data on how men and women date each other ever be true? It would not hold up to basic common sense...

On the age thing, that likely has far more to do with evolutionary psychology than with conscious decision making. Younger women are at the absolute peak of reproductive and mothering capability, at least from physical perspectives. It would stand to reason that younger women are preferred. There's also some evidence that women prefer men older than them because they've gained more status, power and resources, making him a better protector for offspring.

Tim Pool talked about this a while ago. About the ""value"" of men and women at different ages. It went like this: When a woman is younger, her value is absolutely maxed out. When a man is younger, his value starts from absolute zero, and as he matures and gains power and resources, he reaches his peak quite a bit later in life, but STILL will never reach the maxed out value of young women. You can say it's bullshit, but it actually makes a ton of sense from the perspective of evolutionary psychology. 

You have a lot of hatred in your heart and you gotta' be careful about that. I mean that genuinely from the bottom of my heart. I've been where you're at, about a year+ ago. And it absolutely tore me apart."

Nice ad hominem attack there. Take that to debate club and get laughed out of the room. That's what's so insulting. To refuse to engage in ideas and go for a personal attack. Not only is it weak... It shows your an intellectual white belt.

Just because I'm saying some shit you haven't heard before, doesn't make it untrue, or make me dumb. 

Let me say this: I've heard all of the arguments made by your side, but I bet I can tell you a lot of stuff you simply haven't heard because you're in an echo chamber. Again, that doesn't make those things untrue, especially when there's significant evidence to support them."

TLDR: **Criss Angel** (famous magician, duh) and **Marilyn Milian** (the Judge on The People's Court). Backstory to both are below.

&#x200B;

1. My family and I actually met **Criss Angel** at my church in Long Island. He was super cool. Come to find out he always visits his family in Long Island for Easter. It's a tradition in the Greek Orthodox church to always have a feast after the midnight mass (so very early Sunday morning). It was definitely a shock to see him there. He had a modest entourage with him, but mostly he was just sitting there like a normal dude. So for like an hour, I kept looking over at him and he eventually caught me doing it and straight up walked over to our table and shook my hand and he asked me if I'd maybe like a picture with him which I was ecstatic about. I got his autograph too, it was awesome. 
2. Then another time, this was in NYC in a place that doesn't exist anymore, my family and I met **Marilyn Milian** (the Judge from The People's Court) eating with her husband and... I forget if it was maybe their two youngest daughters? I was maybe 10 myself, so long ago. The place was called like ""Mars 2032"" or something like that. It was this weird space-themed place in Times Square and all the servers were dressed up like Martians and there was an arcade lmao. Super weird. But they were extremely nice. They were a couple tables down, and my mom was staring at her, and then she caught her eyes, and she sort of said with her mouth silently, ""Are you..?"" And she smiled and shook her head and literally came over to talk lmao. She was also extremely cool. As I understand, she gets very personal with her audience before and after filming the show and I totally believe that based on what we experienced."
