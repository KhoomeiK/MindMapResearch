It took me four months just to get an endo referral from my PCP. I've had hashis for twenty years and couldn't get a prescription for natural thyroid. Synthetic doesn't work for me, but it took my tsh going up to 50 before my new doctor would take me seriously.

ChronicPain,fgt1ymj,t1_fgrzu9j,1581097355.0,"We can dream I guess. :) 

99% of my providers time is spent on insurance documentation.  If I get a fifteen minute appointment 14 minutes are spent talking about insurance and paperwork. I MIGHT get one minute to talk about the fact I am pretty sure I'm dying.  lol  It's so fucked up.

You know it's horrible when you can't help button someone's shirt without getting inundated with having to do paperwork!  Maybe that's why the police no longer help anybody ... they don't want to do the mountain of paperwork?  What the hell kind of world are we living in?!  

I hope both of us find some kind of relief."
ChronicPain,fgt1vhj,t1_fgs04ob,1581097303.0,Sucks that it's always about litigation ... not a damn thing about getting better ... finding a diagnosis or treatment ... just paperwork and litigation.

ChronicPain,fgszrew,t1_fgsrgnc,1581096051.0,"yeah ... just meditate and do some yoga and it all magically melts away! what the hell?! 

I am going through some of that. I started a bucket list. I think about ending it everyday.  it's insane we get so mistreated when we're just about begging for help. stray dogs get treated better. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChronicPain,fgsz68t,t1_fgrmtfg,1581095699.0,"EXACTLY! I've done it both ways ... shower, dress nice, smile ... get out of bed, put on sweats, not shower ... you're damned either way. There's no winning against the machine."

ChronicPain,fgsyopr,t3_f0bdz4,1581095404.0,"It seems to be the norm when they won't take the time to treat medical conditions ... or are too lazy, stupid, or greedy. They pawn us off on someone else. The problem is the psychiatrist most likely won't find any mental problems. So who do they shuffle you off to then? The system is fucking broken! I have tests that show I have multiple autoimmune diseases, but since none of the doctors seem to know about it .... I'm crazy ... but I'm not ... broken system with circular logic.

Hope you get some relief. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChronicPain,fgohhae,t1_fgogg8k,1580970123.0,"In my case, after blood work, one is saying rheumatoid arthritis possible lupus.  RA is causing some terrible pains in some weird places.  Being this sick takes a lot of work. I hope you get answers asap."
ChronicPain,fgofyxs,t3_ezfrjm,1580968626.0,YES ... I've been doing it for twenty years! Now I'm dealing with Medicaid HMO bullshit and it's so much harder. I can't even guess what specialist referral I need. Hugs. ‚ù§Ô∏è
ChronicPain,fgofkam,t3_ez7jwh,1580968246.0,"Well shit they believe you enough to suggest it might be MS. You're way ahead in the game ... in my opinion. 

I was diagnosed years ago, but since it wasn't them AND I walked into the appointment they're sure it's not MS. lol  Nurse flat out told me since I walked in there I don't have MS, BUT then she tells me my MS is caused by smoking. The MRI in front of her shows lesions and the report says to consider MS. Medicaid has one neurologist accepting patients in my county ... my primary doesn't want to give me a referral since I'm seeing one. Doesn't matter that they are incompetent and abusive. HMO's suck! 

I hope you don't have MS. Stay strong."
ChronicPain,fgoep2s,t3_ezhm35,1580967468.0,"I honestly haven't learned how to cope. Doctors won't listen to me so I don't get to do much anymore. My quality of life is in the dumps.  I struggle with coping everyday. My primary referred me to a therapist and they seem baffled by a chronically ill person, in chronic pain. I keep begging them for coping skills, mechanisms, but they are incompetent and apathetic. Being abused by medical people is NOT helping me cope. lol Medicine is a comedy of errors.

Hope you find something that helps. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ChronicPain,fgodi8w,t3_ez6te1,1580966423.0,I finally figured out that I have a methylation problem and high homocysteine so I don't react normally to anything from pain meds to food. Since doctors don't know anything about it they don't consider it real. I would venture to say it's in your body and not your mind. Your classmate sounds ignorant. Ignorant people are so hurtful.
ChronicPain,fgocid4,t3_ezjell,1580965572.0,"Oh yes. It's a horrible habit. I've got nicotine gum and patches, but all bets are off when my pain is unrelenting.

I had an asshole nurse practitioner tell me last week my MS is caused by smoking. SO I guess that means since I'm such a disgusting person I don't deserve medical treatment or pain management. Enrages me. I know a junkie who smokes, drinks, and shoots up, BUT his doctors treat him like a prince. He gets arterial surgery and all the pain meds he wants BUT I get treated like a dirt bag!"
ChronicPain,fghnwjt,t3_exaw3q,1580789199.0,"Not having pain is addictive. Being able to function is addictive. If eating deep fried crickets worked to ease my pain, and get myself back, I'd be addicted to them.  Maybe doctors need continuing education. Maybe doctors need to stop being so arrogant and listen to their customers.  I'd much prefer to find, and treat, the cause of my pain than be stuck taking pain pills. 

Maybe there are other things that helps with some people's pain besides opiates. Personally most pain meds spike my pain. One thing that has helped some, for me, is correcting a vitamin deficiency with methylfolate. Apparently some of my pain is from high homocysteine and vitamin deficiencies. 

Pain is very individual and doctors don't take the time to listen to figure it out. Whatever it takes to stop my pain is what I'm pushing to get ... I'm not an addict ... I have chronic pain ... it's not rocket science ... by the time they get through their research and ""allow"" me access to pain relief I'll be dead!"

I had anal leakage for ten years. doctors were no help. My personal experience was ..  once I got off benzos it stopped no matter what I ate ... just my personal experience.  I still have to eat low fiber because of Crohn's and I would never attempt wild rice merely because of the high fiber ... it would shred my insides ... probably even after two years .... four weeks is really soon."
