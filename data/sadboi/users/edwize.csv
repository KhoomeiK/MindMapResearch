SuicideWatch,fivqzha,t3_fa3mw4,1582766095.0," Cognitive distortion and to be more specific we are talking about  *emotional reasoning*. It's a thinking pattern where emotions about something are believed to be interpretation of the reality of the event. Of course, before you can counter distorted thinking, you have to become aware that you’re engaging in it.  Watch for patterns in your negative thinking, and explore the underlying themes to reveal the distorted rules you’re living by. 

 When a thought comes to mind, take inventory of it thought by deciding  what parts of it are actually true or just as opinion disguised as  truth. If there are elements that are based on truth, then great, you  have something to work on and change. However, if it is in fact just a  negative opinion, then make it a goal to find the truth—or at least  other possible truths."
SuicideWatch,fiquh5w,t1_fiqmtrk,1582651914.0,It's nice to feel like you belong.
SuicideWatch,fiqt89i,t3_f9d5go,1582651305.0,"If only we could have a ""pause"" button to press from time to time when shit goes down really bad.. Even so, it would make things take a rather weird turn and maybe we are better off without this option in the end."
SuicideWatch,fippg27,t3_f95x5v,1582615206.0,"Whenever you mention this or talk to your mother about it, the whole discussion should be about you and the reasons why you shouldn't do it. The fact that someone else died can be considered as an example but not a real reason, it is about you and not someone else. You should try to point out some of the reasons you want to do it in a way that you want to make clear the fact that you are a priority and should be treated as such."

SuicideWatch,fijg6lg,t3_f86pnj,1582446465.0,Then let me ask this - What would they think about you giving up on life at this point? I'm sure you thought of it yourself but it is important to keep it as a reminder. You are stuck in this neverending loop but you have a chance to escape it or face it so it can loosen it's uneasy grip.
SuicideWatch,fiirybr,t1_fiirg7a,1582425480.0,"That's a problem she will have to face either way so don't try to think it is your fault for some of her decisions. It's clear that she is in a bad spot also and is being pushed around to believe different things or see certain situations in her bf's advantage. Having a toxic relationship won't be easy to deal with even if she has you by her side, you should know that there is more to it than that."
SuicideWatch,fiiqup9,t1_fiiq7yq,1582424905.0,"Have you considered trying to rebuild what you have lost regarding your best friend? Since the connection was strong, from what you are mentioning, it should be an option at this point to try and see how things started good and ended up bad."

SuicideWatch,fiim16s,t3_f82kse,1582423146.0,So how did the improving part came to be unreal or in vain? I'm sure it was a crucial point in the bigger picture but was it that convincing?
SuicideWatch,fiilkk6,t3_f82q3i,1582422964.0,"But is it the right thing to do? There are some other options you might want to consider. If you get into the right mindset for solving the issues, you will be surprised of the results."
SuicideWatch,fiijr5f,t1_fiija71,1582422415.0,"Your mind is in a bad spot right now, you can't let it decide something like this or even consider it as an option.

SuicideWatch,fiiiyh6,t3_f829lh,1582422147.0,"Advancing shouldn't be the main issue now, it is not satisfying to see how everything falls apart just because you managed to put so much effort into it and the result was a bad one. Expectations were high, I get it, but you should consider the fact that now you know what to do in the future if you are put in the same situation. You are not worthless because you simply wanted to achieve your goal, it's more about determination and the fact that you wanted to make it worth the time and struggle in the end."

You need to not be afraid of sharing the ""bad"" side of you with him or else you will end up giving him only 50% of your true self and he will be ok with living in a world where he knows you are okay with everything he says and does."
relationship_advice,fc4af12,t1_fc40nei,1577411010.0,"Then most likely she is seeking revenge of some sort at this point because she knows that she cant drag you down in her sick mind games. I think you shouldnt give her the attention she is seeking for even if you get curious, she hasn't proven anything to you so you can make a move towards her again in any way. If she is looking for something she can address the problem in a smart way but that wont happen given the fact that she is 100% convinced that you were the bad guy all the time no matter the situation."
relationship_advice,fc3rpd4,t1_fc2cmee,1577396936.0,"It depends now. Did you talk to her about it before leaving her ? I mean at least that's the only good thing she could've done back then if she really was interested in having a relationship with you. It's a hard to swallow pill to see someone you love hurt you and turn their back on you after you thought they would change. I'm impressed that you still got out of the toxic thing by yourself, it rarely ends up that way because love is blind ."
relationship_advice,fc3m9sc,t3_efuqcg,1577393073.0,"You need to make the rules look like they are in his favour at first just so he can pay attention and try to hear you out somehow. It can even be at a level when you make him do go things just so he can receive good things, the rewarding system - It can be effective with people that get angry easily because like this they wont feel like they are wasting their time or doing things just because they are told so and so on and so forth."

I'm sure she can help you even on this topic and plus that she has the right to know so there wont be any inconvenience in the future. The fact that you had a bad past shouldnt affect your present that much in a negative way because if you think of it a little you can understand that it doesnt really matter if you get hurt or not because you are prepared for such an outcome due to the past suffering. It's as simple as it can get when it comes to trust, you need to make the rules from the start when it comes to a relationship of any kind."
relationship_advice,fc2zovh,t3_efxdmp,1577378143.0,"You can try to talk to him about in a calm way considering the fact that he ""ignores"" you whenever you want to try and start a fight. He probably knows you are there for him and you will respond anyways so it doesnt mean that something bad will happen if he tries to carry on with his daily tasks. It is rather toxic when you think of it but on another note it can be seen as a normal thing depending how much you insisted on the idea of trust and respect regarding the relationship between you."
relationship_advice,fc2i7cn,t1_fc2hzds,1577361589.0,"It's quite risky to take a decision just yet, you should try to reach out for him but in a simple manner instead of sending a long text that requires him to rumble thru his mind over the wrong he did and try to put it up together."
relationship_advice,fc2hcoq,t1_fc2gueq,1577360289.0,He needs some time to reflect over all these things but there is a possibility where he can fall into depression if he wont ask for any help at all. I suggest you wait a little more before sending that because you dont know what's going on at the time being when he will read it and maybe his mind will twist and get the wrong idea out of it.
relationship_advice,fc2ggfp,t1_fc2g7fm,1577358849.0,"You can act normal, if you send him a message regarding that situation it will remind him over and over about that certain feeling. You can act casual and caring, as usual, to make the whole thing easier and you need to reassure him that it is still safe."
relationship_advice,fc2fce2,t1_fc2f4wl,1577356980.0,"He tried to integrate you in his lifestyle little by little with the possibility that you will walk away, that is not easy, I'm willing to believe he wants to make progress regarding your relationship but now he is facing the downfall of his intention. I think he wants to take all the blame on his side and deal with it on his own to not damage you any further but it's the exact opposite, cant blame him if he wasnt in a situation like this before."
relationship_advice,fc2f86q,t3_eftud2,1577356779.0,You can try to set up limits when it comes to the interaction between you and your friend. To avoid overthinking the bad things you can remind yourself in what situation he is and it will somehow make it easier to accept. It doesnt mean you have to accept anything unless you really want to be headstrong and force it to a point where you dont mind anything at all yet this can be a big issue and damage your perception over the whole situation.
relationship_advice,fc2f40b,t3_eftxvx,1577356580.0,"You need to talk to him about it, you cant make assumptions based on his actions just yet. If he is pushing you away and you did nothing wrong then you should consider the fact that he knows he can rely on you when things go bad but he cant offer his support in return when needed. You encouraged this behaviour by always trying to help and by being unnecessarily understanding to his needs and desires, he clearly knows you wont go away no matter what he says or does and that's a big plus for him."
relationship_advice,fc2erka,t1_fc2em76,1577356000.0,"In general, yes, but you need to consider he is a straight forward person so its unlike him to try and hide stuff. You dont need to think that you can give him all the time in the world for one mistake because if something else like this happens again you will end up waiting for things to settle down which can lead into a never ending loop of unnecessary patience."
relationship_advice,fc2eol3,t3_efsr9o,1577355863.0,You should try to talk to her on a more serious note because this behaviour is quite bad. She might be upset or heartbroken but there is no reason to let everything else to go down the drain just because this feeling lingers with an abnormal intensity and the thought of him gets her head and heart  go numb in pain. I'm sure that if you talk to her about it and try to get out some important details regarding her issue you could help her better to understand where it went good and where it went wrong.
relationship_advice,fc2efct,t1_fc2edrt,1577355429.0,You cant know that for sure even if you want to go full trust on someone. You need to wait for a response and try to have a normal discussion from where you can get some crucial information out of him.
relationship_advice,fc2e5f8,t3_eftpjh,1577354960.0,"The fact that he wants to distance himself or even break up can mean that he is regretting what he did but being drunk is not an excuse for such a mistake. You need to think of it from his point of view a little to understand how he wants to manage things at this point because he doesnt want to accept the ""mistake"" as being part of what he is and feels like he betrayed you which is disappointing to say the least. Give him some time to think it thru and it's okay that you pointed out that you will forgive him but he has to forgive himself first to move on. You were understanding and tried to manage the situation in a calm way with him and that was a red flag for him maybe because he was expecting you to argue or something along that line, you instead tried to show him that forgiveness is an option. If he doesnt trust someone that much you need to consider that being forgiven for a mistake is unlikely to happen and when it does it cant be accepted that easily."
relationship_advice,fc0s542,t3_efjksh,1577298349.0,"You can try to talk with her about her relationship more in a way that you could find more info that can be useful in this situation, just dont make it awkward. It doesnt mean now that you should corner her or try to push her into thinking it wont work or things like that, it's just that in this way you can see if there is any potential regarding your interest. Having spent some time with her and doing all those things together made you think a little about how she understands you but has she put it out that you shouldnt understand something bad or misinterpreted her behaviour?"
relationship_advice,fc0r67p,t3_efiqc9,1577297641.0,"You cant expect him to be there at your every move and so on even if you do enjoy his company and want to do everything together you should consider giving him the time to manage other things in his life. The main issue is that you rely too much on him and focused your full attention on him when you should try to find things that you enjoy doing for example reading or going for a walk and so on and so forth. Putting so much effort just into one single person is wrong because you forget about your own needs and you slowly become a shadow of that person instead of being yourself. He wont enjoy the fact that you do nothing except please his needs and wont move an inch if he isn't there to tell you that, plus that he can easily get bored and will strike you with the fact that he needs someone he can be with and do things instead of having a slave. It's a thin line to cross when you think of it, you dont want to disappoint or make him feel bad but at the same time you dont want yourself to feel bad for not knowing what to do next."
relationship_advice,fc0pb4a,t3_efhzpb,1577296439.0,"The first real love is important just as a starting point just as in everything else, you discover something new and you try to adapt and understand what it's all about. Once you start experiencing more and more on that side you can easily see what you really seek for and what your expectations are, as long as you dont get stuck on a certain type that you think is acceptable."
relationship_advice,fc0jx1n,t1_fc0j8kn,1577292500.0,"That's just being selfish, not accepting that your behaviour comes off in a toxic way towards others is far from being alright. I dont think this behaviour can change especially when you reach a certain age and here there are two main issues to be mentioned here - One is that this behaviour was accepted until it became something normal and the other one is that he cant come to realise the side effect of this behaviour and doesnt want to consider them as being real."
relationship_advice,fc0itv2,t3_efhipz,1577291786.0,Have you tried to talk about it with him? I mean all this time since you say it's not the first time he is acting like this. You can bring it up in a friendly manner just so he wont acknowledge it as a bad think from the start and ignore it or have a bad reaction. I imagine how it feels for you to try and communicate and get rejected like this but you need to point it out sooner or later if you want it to change. Ofc it can be a possibility that he will ignore your cry for help to call it so but you can be pleased with the fact that you pointed out what's wrong and tried to fix it.
relationship_advice,fc0g280,t1_fc0byde,1577290009.0,"So you are caught between wanting to know what she is doing or how she is feeling and the fact that you know you should give her the space she needs. It's understandable to a point where you both get to relax and take things easy but it damages the whole relationship in the end. You have the natural urge to help the one you love but its painful to do nothing and you feel kinda useless to say the least. You should think about the fact that she knows you have her back and if something happens she can always count on you to help her or to listen to her, it's a big thing for her. You need to try and temper this urge and keep your mind busy because if not it can lead to a bad end. I'm not saying you should keep it busy with other things and forget about her but you can think of ways to improve the whole relationship when this issue will be solved."
relationship_advice,fc0f4x3,t1_fc0c6ml,1577289218.0,There is a small chance that she will earn it back considering the fact that she was the one who made the wrong things first but have you tried to put yourself in her shoes for a second? Trying to make up for the wrongs you did is not easy and there are a lot of conflicting situations you have to consider and go thru. It can never be how it used to be once and you both know that but it doesnt mean that she cant make up for the wrongs she did although it can never be enough. At this point you need to think what you want to do and take the situation on your own shoulders because there is no reason to postpone an inevitable ending.
relationship_advice,fc0b4nk,t3_efebwu,1577285596.0,"You should talk with her about it, I mean what was the reason she wanted this or what caused her to turn around and put everything on pause regarding the relationship between you guys. Communication is key and with that you can get wonderful results. It is wrong to assume someone wants to cheat just because they insist on taking a break but if they do it with no good reason then it should raise a big question mark. If you want this to grow and work well then both sides should give attention to what's going on around them no matter the situation."
relationship_advice,fc0ag4w,t3_efewae,1577284937.0,"The main thing to think about here are the children, you dont want them to grow up in a broken family but if you look at it even now you can clearly see it is quite torn apart just because of its poor start. You cant really sacrifice your happiness in order to create an illusion  that the children wont know how things were going on and everything can be fixed just like that. She clearly wants to remain in the bubble that was created by you when you've accepted her back and made a compromise for the children, she feels safe and tries to make her life around that one main condition that she is okay as long as the children are. That can be taken as an excuse for her behaviour so she likes to hide behind the responsibility instead of taking it and making things happen, plus that she knows you wouldnt want the children to feel bad because of your actions. You feel selfish now that you found someone who you genuinely like and get along with because that's something you've been missing from the start, it's not a bad thing that you want to fulfill your own desires and needs but you need to take in consideration the consequences that come with it."
relationship_advice,fc07wxm,t3_efb9ia,1577282304.0,"She needs to prove her worth in the end. The fact that you guys sat down and talked about it doesn't mean it's solved. You should try to keep her on this path where she will be okay with telling you all sort of things that go thru her mind so you can sort it out together. You can't expect someone to just change after a simple discussion because they will most likely take it as a scolding and won't understand the main issue, plus that you have to cut the roots of this behaviour step by step if you intend on getting rid of it."
