It does not work for DTS, period, despite saying in the manual that Night Mode supports DTS. Did you purchase a soundbar from their new lineup or is it from their first generation? The new ones might not have this issue I would hope. 

But yeah, Night Mode is important -to me as well. The dynamic range is too wide somtimes that you have to sit with the damn remote control riding the volume up and down."
depression,fannv3s,t3_e9hksr,1576246167.0,I am not bitter. I am just very embarassed over myself. I had the same oppurtunities as my friends but just let it all go to waste for reasons I can't even understand. All my friends are done with university and lead very stable lives. I am very jealous but also incredibly proud of them for not being total fucktards failures like me. I have sibblings who are doing very well too. I just don't know why it went the way it did for me. I don't think there is a reasonable explanation for it. I hate myself more for each passing day. It's not too late for me to turn this shit around but I feel mentally crippled by the years I wasted. My friends tell me to forget about the years I wasted and move on.. But it's not easy.. They could never understand how it feels wasting 10 years.

depression,f4urdgg,t1_f4u1xt4,1571825548.0,Graduation in Sweden is very different from America. You don't have a formal graduation ceremony. Some schools have smaller ceremonies where you can apply to walk before a audience but it's not standard.
depression,f4ur9zg,t1_f4ukacp,1571825409.0,"I ask myself the same thing very often. It baffles me that I have been able to live these lies for so long. Am I that good at acting/lying or are they extremely ignorant? In my opinion there has been a lot of red flags and yet I escaped questions/situations. My mother used to ask me to show her my ""grades"" in the beginning of my lies and of course I never showed her anything, not even forged ones. I just kept saying I will just let me get them first. That alone should have made her think what the fuck is going on? But she never questioned it further. She could easily contact the university and ask for my ""grades"". Government institutions in Sweden are very transparent. You can ask for people's grades, salaries etc no questions asked."
depression,f4sc2c4,t1_f4r1lh8,1571776374.0,"I live in Sweden with my parents. I have worked weekends and a little bit on weeksdays since i finished high school so I have saved up some money. Before I started studying again I worked full time 6 months as IT-support. I quickly realised ""I can't fucking do this all my life. I gotta study"", so I started my two year programme. Also, in Sweden you get money from the government to study and you can take a loan which is basically interest free. I get around 12k dollars a month from that. So yeah, saved money + that is how I get by."
depression,f4saj3f,t1_f4quhcj,1571775992.0,"I fail to see how it's selfless. If anything it was my selfishness of not being able to be honest about my failures due to the disappoinment I would cause my parents. Their reputation wouldn't be that badly affected tbfh. They have two other children who are excellent at life.  

My actions were mostly about me not feeling shame and bad about myself because of how my parents would react. I care too much about what they think.   If I were honest I would have to listen to their negative shit all the time though, which is the main reason for my lies. I don't know how I would have handled that. Like I said, I've been pretty much a disappointment my whole life, they don't say it straight to my face, but I hear in how they speak about me to our relatives and stuff, even my older brother.

Their disappointment would be 100x worse if they found out now than had I been honest from the beginning. Think about it, they have been lying because I told them lies.  They probably would have have told lies to other people if they knew the truth, but at least it would be their choice to do so...."
depression,f4qhjc7,t3_dlfw2v,1571753361.0,"I wouldn't say I am barely holding onto life, but I have barely any motivation or drive... I have wasted almost a decade of my life doing absolutely nothing of worth after high school. I started a 2 year programme this year and hopefully it will lead somewhere. Still, I very often think about how the fuck I could have just let almost 10 years go to waste, 10 fucking years! It's eating me inside. If I was given the option to go back 10 years in time there would be absolutely no hesitation. I am 28 years old.

Also, I have been lying to my family for 10 years about going to college. They think I have a degree and a stable job. I never should have lied but I have always felt like such a big disappointment that I couldn't tell the truth. It's been going on for too long for me to come clean. It would be an extreme embarassment for my family. My parents are from a south asian country where status and shit like that is a huge part of the culture. I have two sibblings, an older brother and a younger sister. Older brother is the complete opposite of me, has a masters degree and is CFO for pretty big company. My younger sister is 9 years younger than me and in her last year of high school and is doing excellent in school, straight A student and is definitely heading for a very bright future. I am the ONLY fuck up in my family which makes me feel worse.

I live a double life basically. My family knows nothing of my situation but my friends do. My friends don't know that I've been lying to my family for so long. My friends all lead very stable lives. Most of them are highly educated. I feel like I can't tell them, they have no big secrets like this of their own and would think I am absolutely pathetic. I mean hell, I think I am pathetic! I live in a nordic country where I have had all the oppurtunities but still managed to do nothing! People in other countries would risk their life to get to the country I live in, to have the oppurtunities I wasted..

I have stage 4 chronic kidney disease. I've had problem with my kidneys since I was a child. I don't need dialysis yet, but I expect I will need it in 10 years. I don't know how my kidneys are affecting me physically. The doctors asks me every checkup if I am feeling alright. I feel like I always have been feeling, which is alright. I don't know how I would feel If I had healthy kidneys as I have never had it... I often think about ""When am I gonna wake up and my kidneys are not stable enough?"" I hate it.

I have played with the thought of suicide, but I will never do it, I can't stand the thought of doing that to my family..."

It's a damn shame that the DRC on the bar is shit and that the settings on the box are neglected. DRC is really nice to have sometimes, especially at night when you don't wanna wake up the neighbors but still be able to hear the dialogue.

Hopefully we get Season 5 and we probably will. Netflix always does at least 2 seasons of a show and as far as I've read season 4 has been doing well so I can't see why it would be cancelled.
