GriefSupport,fqaa94p,t3_ghqy5q,1589215587.0,I've been dealing with my sister's passing since january and the only advice I have is to cry when you feel like you're going to because holding it in just makes it worse when it finally does come out. Take one day at a time as they say and try not to be too hard on yourself. People you care about are gone and it hurts and it's going to hurt for a while. I'm so sorry for your losses. I lost my grandfather two weeks before my sister and then my grandmother two months after my sister. It's been a rough road dealing with multiple losses but someday it won't hurt so much. Or at least that's what they say.

Masterchef,fprin4q,t3_gew1nj,1588855103.0,My husband can't stand her and thinks the only reason one of the winners during her one of her seasons won is because she had a crush on him (I can't remember the guy's name for the life of me). Idk where he got that from but I just think we didn't like the winner all season and he may have been grasping at straws. Lol
thesims,foz0y7y,t3_gad018,1588182789.0,I just saw a townie with like every tattoo ever. Now I have no issues with tattoos. My sister had at least 25. But it was the most random one I'd seen in a while.
GriefSupport,fonvnod,t3_g8dcyl,1587927368.0,I'm so sorry. I lost my younger sister in January and I still find it hard to sleep without waking up panicky and just missing her so much. Losing her has been the hardest thing in my life and I'm sure this will be for you as well. :( Please hang in there.

GriefSupport,fnb8rm5,t1_fnb8gql,1586811208.0,Thank you for this. I feel like I'm losing my mind and finally made the call to talk to a counselor because my husband is doing the best he can but I think I need an unbiased person.
GriefSupport,fnayg7v,t1_fnaxuas,1586806034.0,Thank you for this. I lost my grandfather and sister in the same month. And two weeks ago I lost my grandmother (not the wife of the grandparent I lost). I knew my grandparents were old and they would leave someday but my sister's death is just so hard to accept. I'm sad for all of them but feel like it will never get better. I'm trying so hard to keep it together for work but it's just hard sometimes.
GriefSupport,fnathva,t1_fnat97q,1586803547.0,I'm so sorry for your losses. This is just a terrible time to be living in and going through these things.

thesims,fn47jtz,t3_fz9x57,1586635659.0,I have this issue as well. They fixed the prep task issue but now my actress doesn't get the option for me to join or to send her alone to work. There's no go to work button and it's so frustrating. I gave up on her until they fixed the prep task issue and now this issue comes up. :( I fear she will never achieve her dreams. (that last line is sad but sarcastic)

antidepressants,fkcyj6a,t1_fkcyg7w,1584064120.0,Yeah they usually put you on a super low dose if they're going to do it for depression. It freaked me out at first too.

antidepressants,fkcox4h,t3_fhp991,1584057808.0,I only take 2 mg of abilify with wellbutrin xl 450 mg and my husband says he can see a big difference. It helps me be more motivated. I didn't want to do jack shit and that was making me backslide but now I actually want to do things. So far it's been okay.
GriefSupport,fk8pot3,t3_fgr2ra,1583960530.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss. 

I am grieving the loss of my younger sister and I never thought I'd feel so empty without her. I'm just going through the motions of working and whatever else I'm supposed to be doing until I have a week off next month because I just don't even know how to get through this. I lost my sister mid-January and it still feels so new and raw. I'm hoping as time passes it'll get better but I don't think it will. Other people in my family lost their sibling and they were never the same. I don't think I'll ever be who I was before. It is so hard to think that I am an only child. No, I have a sister. She's just somewhere else I hope. I miss her so much. I feel like there's a huge hole in my chest all the time.

Edit to add: I also don't know how I'm supposed to grow older and deal with all the things we were supposed to do together. Like it's weighing so much on my mind that once I lose my parents (hopefully many years from now), I'm going to be alone. I don't have her half of our memories together anymore and I'm so scared to be without her."
GriefSupport,fk1dffk,t3_fft6c8,1583777412.0,Yes. I can barely watch tv shows or movies that we both enjoyed because it just reminds me of how much we enjoyed them together. It just makes me miss her more and it's hard enough to just think about her.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fjeytiu,t1_fjec69w,1583280749.0,I'm so sorry for your loss and sorry that people decided to be so inappropriate.  Wow.
GriefSupport,fj7yynl,t3_fc0esx,1583101383.0,Be there. I got to my sister's hospital room seven hours before she passed. Idk what I would be like now if I had waited and didn't make it.

GriefSupport,fj14nb1,t3_faxyjx,1582912933.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I was out to dinner with my husband and his friend and had to stop myself from crying several times because I didn't want to being attention to myself and whatever. But I am definitely with you on wondering to other people have sisters (since i lost mine). Wondering if they think I'm crazy. Wondering all sorts of random things I don't think I ever would have thought of before. I hope you are okay. Sending lots of love.
GriefSupport,fiuhuet,t3_f9x68i,1582741681.0,I'm so sorry for your loss and that your experience wasn't the best at the group. I hope next time is better.
GriefSupport,firxtwh,t3_f9ivps,1582673293.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I feel this same way. Like the sadness is never going to end and everyone is going to stop being there for me because of it. I don't want to bother people with my sadness.
GriefSupport,firxq78,t3_f9j2gq,1582673228.0,I'm sorry for your loss. I also wish I could dream with my sister since it seems everyone else has been having these great dreams with her. Idk why but mine are just unsettling. I hope you have a great dream soon.

GriefSupport,fij9qta,t3_f82vw0,1582438975.0,My uncle passed away when I was 8. I am now 37 and I still miss him. Talking about him still makes me teary eyed and everyone in the family still gets sad around the holidays as he died before Christmas. I asked a psychiatrist if it was normal and they said that grief has no timeline and it's okay to still miss someone even 20 years later.
GriefSupport,fihjfr4,t1_fihgi4t,1582411033.0,You are so right. ðŸ’–ðŸ’–
GriefSupport,figuw8k,t1_figujuu,1582403702.0,You're welcome. And yeah I guess we all should. My mother in law tried to pull some shit like that to my husband about me being upset after my best friend passed since she was sick for a while before it happened. He shut her down real quick thankfully. I hope you can find some peace someday.
GriefSupport,figqfvj,t3_f7wt8y,1582402529.0,I'm sorry you're going through this. I lost my sister to something similar but that doesn't make your grief any less than mine or vice versa. I'm so sorry your friend didn't stop to think before she said that.
GriefSupport,fibpuzv,t3_f7jdro,1582327337.0,I'm so sorry. :( They may not know how to broach the subject maybe. Maybe they don't want to make you hurt or make you sad by bringing it up. I'm sorry that they aren't including you. Sometimes people don't know how to act after a loved one dies. I hope you can find peace someday. :(
GriefSupport,fib419n,t3_f7d53m,1582314173.0,"If you think it might make you feel better or better able to handle what is happening, then do it. Sometimes trying to retain some normalcy is what helps some people get through tough times. My husband wanted to see his best friend a couple days after my sister passed and I knew it would help him so I wasn't mad. Your parents know you're there for them and probably want you to do what will help you too."
GriefSupport,fiaxghx,t3_f7drfw,1582310327.0,I'm so sorry for your loss.
GriefSupport,fi8m92p,t1_fi8m3cd,1582243385.0,"That was a really good idea. And yes, she'll definitely appreciate it. I sent my friend's mom a birthday card and she wasn't expecting it so she sent me a card in return to thank me. I didn't want or need the thanks because I just wanted to make sure she knew she wasn't forgotten just because her daughter is no longer with us. I hope you can find peace in this terrible pain someday."
GriefSupport,fi8llem,t3_f6vz73,1582242978.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my best friend 3 years ago and I felt the same way. I felt like no one would ever know me like she did. I also felt guilty that I was alive and she wasn't since her mom had also lost her younger brother the week before. It was an awful situation but make sure to try and keep in touch with her parents if you were close with them in any way. I send her mom birthday and mother's day cards because I know that my friend would have liked that. Try something like that maybe later on. Or just send a sympathy card if you haven't already or even if you've already expressed your condolences in person. You lost someone you love just like they did. It's an awful thing to have in common but sharing memories can help too.
GriefSupport,fi4zpgz,t3_f5hgl1,1582151767.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my younger sister (34, just 3 months before her 35th bday) last month and I am dreading anyone asking me this. I don't know what I would do. I was also there when she passed and having those images in my mind on repeat has been so hard. I hope that you can find some peace. I also advocate for EMDR. My cousin says it has helped her immensely with trauma. And my parents are going to start going to a grief group type thing soon. I hope, if you can also do these things, that it can help you."
GriefSupport,fi4yzn2,t3_f66pic,1582151327.0,"If your friend wants to talk, you can just listen. You don't have to say anything that you think might be comforting. You can but sometimes silence is okay. I feel like, going through losing my sister and grandfather, the best thing my husband can do for me is just listen when I'm sad, not try to fix my sadness."

I have some regrets but it's also still really fresh for me. I made sure at her funeral to tell anyone with younger siblings especially to make sure they squeeze them and tell them they love them. This has been super hard. I hope you can find your way through.
GriefSupport,fgstsxt,t3_f01bz1,1581092508.0,"If it makes you feel better, then leave it up.

I went to do it and erased it because I'm not feeling like the smiley face and I don't really are how it comes off at the moment. The only emojis I feel okay using are heart emojis when talking to other people in my family that are suffering the same losses I am. I thought it was just me.

My boss didn't tell anyone about my situation as I was also dealing with the hospitalization and subsequent loss of my sister. She still hadn't told anyone once I came back to work last week the week after the funeral. She told me she didn't feel it was her place to say anything and I felt okay with that. I just am worried now that people think I was sick or that I was on vacation as well. I don't know how to broach the topic with anyone outside the few people I did tell so it doesn't seem like I was out of work having a good old time. Part of me is glad though because I haven't gotten the unnecessary questions. I hope you can get through this and just remember if they don't know, they won't know what to say."
