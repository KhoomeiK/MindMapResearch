I even left work twice because I didnt know how to cope with it in public. So my supervisor advised me that I should go home and get some rest and if I still felt the same to take an extra day off and then come back the next if I was scheduled to.

Anxiety,fnw5njl,t3_g3z40y,1587311930.0,"I started having these bad anxiety attacks a few months ago literally out of nowhere and idk what would have triggered it but. My heart was racing and it felt like someone was sitting on my chest, I felt extremely tired and exhausted and just wanted to sleep and I kept nodding off as if I was about to pass out, my hands would sweat, I would shake as if I cold but wasn't, and I would think about why my heart was beating so fast which made it worse, I'd lose my appetite and still haven't fully regained it so I eat small light things like salad, bread, fruits, veggies, some sweets like chips ahoy and stuff. This all happened during my job orientation when I got hired onto home depot. And this was in early February. I didn't even think about the virus when it happened. But the episodes kept happening on and off until this past week in which I haven't had any episodes. Which I'm thankful for. And I didn't have any cough, throat itch or anything. But I do have allergies so I sneeze alot during this season usually. But now that I think about it, I'm like, is that the virus cuz I felt like I was going to die. I even left work several times because of how bad it was. And I'd shower after getting home and would just fall asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow, sometimes I wouldn't even fall asleep, I'd be  there laying awake and afraid I'd die in my sleep or something.

Also YouTube clips of the show Family Guy helps me calm down from my attacks too which is weird. This is everything I've experienced with my anxiety attacks which started a month ago after showing up to job orientation hungover. I don't drink often either so I must've been really hungover, cuz I kept nodding off during the orientation meeting, also probably from the first anxiety experience as well.
