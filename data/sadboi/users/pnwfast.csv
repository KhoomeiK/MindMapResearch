neoliberal,fk1n5rf,t3_ffpk17,1583783025.0,"All the cries of sexism regarding Warren's exit are just ridiculous. Here is why:

\-Hillary was the nominee 4 years ago, and she won the popular vote in the general election by 3 million votes. She only lost to Trump because the electoral college system we still have. Clearly, more people wanted a woman running this country in 2016.

\-She was part of the last 3 candidates standing in a field that had well over 20 to start with. How did she beat so many men for so long if sexism was the issue?

\-In October 2019, Warren was the front runner, FAR ahead of Bernie. In mid-October, Bernie got endorsements from AOC & Ilhan Omar. 2 FEMALE progressives gave their support to the old white guy instead of endorsing Warren. Her numbers began a steady decline at that point as Sanders numbers began to rise.

\- If we are throwing out ""-isms"" every time a candidate doesn't get enough support to win, why is sexism the only one being thrown out this election cycle? One could just as easily and with just as much evidence argue that the Democrat establishment supporting Biden over Bernie is because of anti-semitism. Are white progressives that supported Warren over Kamala Harris  or Cory Booker guilty of racism? 

Many of the people blaming sexism point to Warren's intellect and policy positions making her the best candidate. However, anyone who has ever paid attention to presidential elections should already be fully aware that the smartest person with the best policy positions frequently does not win."
ElizabethWarren,fjoz43b,t3_fekovw,1583537969.0,"Democrats nominated a woman in 2016, and despite a lot of political baggage, Hillary still got 3 million more votes than Trump and simply lost the presidential election due to our ridiculous electoral college system. It is also easy to assume a lot of would be Hillary voters sat home because they weren't excited about voting for her, but didn't think in a million years America would be dumb enough to elect Trump and thought their vote wouldn't make a difference.In the lead up to the 2016 election,everybody was going on and on about how far we've come because we've finally nominated a woman (and everyone assumed she would become president running against an idiot like Trump.) Now that Dems didn't nominate a woman 2 elections in a row, we are getting articles from every direction lamenting just how sexist we still are?

Let's not forget she was the front runner in October 2019. Did everyone suddenly find out she was a woman and change their mind? Of course not. 

Please, just stop it already. Are we all still racist because we didn't nominate Harris or Booker even though we happily voted Obama in for 2 terms? Warren failed to generate enough excitement to win. She only got 24% of female votes in her home state. Clearly, plenty of people had valid reasons to choose someone else. Blaming it on sexism just sounds like sore losers."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,fiusrbn,t3_f9wy0d,1582747584.0,"He says the network both isn't tough enough on Trump, but also doesn't give him credit when its due. Sounds like a fair journalist to me. Trump himself agrees with half of that statement and says so frequently.  

I think his suspension probably had more to do with him bagging on Good Morning America for being full of useless fluff."
politics,fib0m2v,t3_f752cb,1582312178.0,"Warren left off one part that would probably keep them quiet even if Bloomberg did sign it. Before anyone can be released to speak, they have to pay back 100% of the money they took to start with. That was the deal. You can call it paying to silence victims or you can call it gold digging, I don't care. Either way, its a 2 way deal. No way they get to keep the money and talk."
fantasyfootball,fgkjpsh,t3_ey0ov2,1580867151.0,"Mahomes deserved the MVP as much as anyone else, not necessarily more. People keep saying he played horrible except half of the 4th quarter, wrong. He did fine in the first quarter, other than a 3 and out to start, but then led a touchdown drive including running the ball and taking big hits along the way. How is that playing horrible? He played like an average QB the 2nd quarter, then had a flat out bad 3rd quarter. His team is in the hole 10 points with a few minutes to play and he played tremendous doing his part to lead the Chiefs to a 4 point lead."
Patriots,ffs5hfa,t3_ekwrja,1580173626.0,"Brady is not the GOAT because there is no such thing. GOAT arguments are nothing more than fan opinion arguments. Sure, you can throw around stats and SB wins to make different arguments, but its still simply opinion. There is no GOAT and never will be because of the sheer number of variables in a team sport leave it open to subjective opinions which can never be bias free.

SB wins seem to dominate any discussion of Brady being the GOAT. But if SB wins decide how great a player is, then Terry Bradshaw was a much better QB than Dan Marino. Jim Plunkett was as good as Peyton Manning. Trent Dilfer was better than Dan Fouts. But the truth is players don't win superbowls, teams do.

Individual players on winning teams aren't automatically greater than individuals on teams that win less. Take Barry Sanders and Emmitt Smith. Sanders played 10 years on one of the worst teams in football and finished with 15,269 rushing yards. Smith played 15 seasons and finished with 18,355 yards AND 3 SB wins. Is Smith better than Sanders? Nobody in their right mind would say Smith was a superior running back to Sanders.

When it comes to Brady, his overall play has not been far beyond others at the QB position. I have no doubt that if Drew Brees would have been with the Patriots all these years, they could have just as many SB wins. And if Brady had played elsewhere, he could have had a Dan Marino type of career, putting up amazing numbers, but never getting a ring. Would that mean Brady wasn't the same guy with the same amazing skills and greatness? No, it would just mean having those amazing skills and greatness didn't produce a SB win.

Clearly, Brady is one of the greatest to ever play the game. But he is not the GOAT since there is no such thing except in opinionville."

Moved to Washington in 2015 and it was around $15 per gram. Now I buy 3.5 grams of good quality weed for $15 at the pot store near our house. Supply, selection, and price should all improve over time."
ANW,ezw94bj,t3_d20n2c,1568211124.0,"I think they expected snap back to take out more ninjas because it was a tough one in the city rounds, but once the ninjas figured out to hit it with their forearms and grab it from there, it suddenly became pretty easy for all. The waverunner has been more challenging in the past and there are no tricks to beating it. 

The grim reaper looked cool, but after they got going, it looked like a moderately challenging city qualifier obstacle. They needed a bigger gap or a more difficult ledge to grab, or both. 

I don't expect to see another stage 2 be this easy in the future, they certainly couldn't have wanted 21 finishers. The upside this year is we will find out just how tough stage 3 really is with 21 people running it."
inthesoulstone,exqkrq3,t3_ct6iig,1566503610.0,"Just like Batman, there have been so many Spiderman movies its hard for me to care. Far From Home was the first Spiderman movie that I've enjoyed, and now that I actually for once was looking forward to the next spidey movie, it looks like it is over. Easy come, easy go I guess."
TheOCS,exlrwaa,t3_bey9tt,1566418317.0,"I think there is some truth to it, but its far from a reliable indicator just to go by whether its labelled as sativa or indica. And as with all things, individual results will vary.  Super silver haze, durban poison, and Alaska thunder fuck are pretty reliably energetic get things done kind of strains for me and they are considered sativas. Granddaddy purple, romulan, and hindu kush are reliable full body relaxation strains with a very sedating and couch lock effect for me and they are considered indicas. 

Green crack is supposedly one of the most energetic strains and is a sativa, but I usually feel a little sedated and tired when I smoke it. Northern lights is supposed to be an indica with a heavier feel to it, but I usually feel relaxed but wide awake. 

As plenty of others have said, the terpene profiles have a lot to do with the high, then your own personal chemistry will have an effect as well. 

I think for now, the sativa and indica labels are fine because the whole legal side is new and not much research has been done. I do think eventually research will lead us to much better ways of classifying different strains and will give consumers better information to make decisions with."
lastweektonight,ex2981i,t3_cm7eio,1565965145.0,"I was a big fan of this show up until this episode, and for the first time I see how utterly biased it is. His goal isn't to present a fair story, it is to paint a very unflattering picture of a topic to emotionally manipulate the viewers, who then think they are compassionate people who see the ""truth"".

I know someone who works for one of the companies he bashed, and Oliver clearly did this as a smear piece. A few basic facts would have left an entirely different impression on the audience, but he only presents facts that tell the story he wants people to hear.

Prison phone calls outrageously expensive? The cities/counties/states are much more to blame. Many of them require extremely high commission rates from whatever company provides their telephone systems, sometimes as much as 85% of the cost of the call is a commission to the prison, not to the company providing the phones. Why do they do this? Frequently to fill in  their own budget gaps.  But that isn't as juicy of a story, so Oliver omits it.

Also never mentioned, these aren't just pay phones that simply allow people to talk. There is advanced software involved to monitor calls. Why? Because people in prison frequently try to organize crime on the outside. The  software flags conversations based on words used for review by correctional officers. Many attempts to have a judge, witness or someone else murdered have been thwarted by these phone systems. Also criminals tell on themselves frequently, as well as giving info about unsolved crimes while talking to someone on the outside. Many murders, rapes, kidnappings, etc. have been solved because of these phones.

Video calls are terrible and outrageously expensive? Tell that to someone who wants to see their loved one in prison, yet they live 200 miles from the prison and need to take off work, put kids in daycare, etc., just to go to the prison to see their loved one. Easily 20X more expensive than the highest video call rates. And if the jails weren't requiring high commission rates, the calls wouldn't be nearly so expensive to begin with. Also, prisoners do not have to be transferred for video calls, which is a big safety measure for jails because that is when a lot of criminals start fights, riots, etc. 

I don't doubt for a second there are abuses taking place, but when Oliver's segment is scrutinized, it shows he is essentially biased and dishonest. Are the facts presented true? I think so most of the time. But omitting facts that would make the picture look far different is essentially the same as lying.

Pisses me off because I had been a HUGE fan of his show. Now after this segment I have that same dirty feeling I would get after watching Fox News. I see the manipulation as clear as day and cannot look at Oliver the same anymore."
marvelstudios,eukfzvz,t3_cg0bt9,1563887803.0,"I'm bummed Portman is coming back. Ragnarok was the best Thor movie so far, and the Jane Foster/Thor lack of chemistry was the biggest flaw for the first 2 Thor movies.

Honestly I'm not at all excited about the lady Thor line. Sure, it could be good, but there are a ton of other Thor story lines I would have preferred, like the God Butcher. Feels like this was chosen more because of the ""we have to be more diverse"" obligation than it being the best story line available. Besides, Thor was already turned into a fat crybaby for Endgame, one movie after finally reaching the height of his powers in the MCU. I have a feeling Thor will never return to that form again in the MCU and if that is the case they will have ruined the character for me.

We already have Valkyrie representing a strong female, and one of the few female superheroes that actually has some muscle and power to her appearance, something that has not been done nearly enough with female superheroes. The more time they spend on Natalie Portman, the less time they can focus on Tessa Thompson. Considering Portman's weak performance in the first 2 Thor installments and Thompson's brilliant performance in Ragnarok, its a shame to know they brought Portman back just to run the lady Thor story."
depression,eu37c4q,t3_cd0hjp,1563407223.0,"Hadn't heard the term functional depression, but what you described is exactly what I've been dealing with for a few years now. I do my work enough to get by and I take care of basic hygiene. I feel so guilty for feeling depressed that I don't like to be around other people because I'm afraid I'll bring them down and I don't want to mess up someone else's happiness. I'm 43 and I've lost all interest in hobbies I used to have, like I can't even remember what it was I liked. I haven't had a real friend in 15-20 years, only a couple of general acquaintances from work. I have no idea how to socialize with other people outside of getting drunk which I rarely do. Somehow, most mornings I still wake up thinking today will be the day I start to turn things around. And by noon I'm wishing a meteorite would crash into me and vaporize my existence because I can't see any positive possibilities. I've been through so much self help, therapy, briefly tried anti-depressants which made me worse, and now I have a hard time taking the idea of getting help seriously anymore."
