With basically being stuck in my house the last 3 weeks due to an injury, though, I'm feeling especially bad. I just want someone to hug me."
depression,feu6lyi,t3_eqcju4,1579383622.0,"I finally had a conversation with a friend about depression the other night while we were playing video games. Between me having depression and him suffering from severe anxiety I was able to just have an honest conversation about how shit gets to me and how I feel empty all the time. And it was the first time I've had one of those conversations with someone without being told how to fix things and get out of my ""rut.""

I get people wanting, or at least trying, to help. Sometimes, though, all I want, all I need, is someone to listen to me. I'm a fucking human being, not a side project."

depression,fdi3yo1,t3_elhhgz,1578435312.0,"I feel like this a lot. Generally speaking, people irritate me. I don't like crowded areas, I don't particularly care for meeting lots of new people, and I'm rather particular about who I spend my time with. Still, when I'm alone too much I feel so detached from everyone and everything. Definitely relate to the feeling of wanting someone to be close with.

depression,fdfkzq0,t3_ekw3j2,1578364141.0,"When my last relationship ended my ex told me she couldn't handle me when I went all ""depression mode"" and waved her hand for effect. Then had the audacity to say she hoped we could still be friends. All I could say was okay. Then I packed up my shit and left, swearing I'd never talk to her again. And I've kept that promise.

I understand that I can be a lot to handle at times, and I know it's hard to see someone you care about suffer but feel unable to help. The way I look at it, though, is that if someone really cares about me they won't just bail when the chips are down. I'm open with people I want to date about my struggles with depression and being a recovered addict. They can either accept that or they can't."
depression,fdfjitk,t3_ekuia8,1578363176.0,"Sometimes I feel like I'm Atlas, being crushed beneath the weight of the world yet somehow still holding on, refusing to give up. But then I shift the weight, take a deep breath, and stand tall, the burden of the past, of all I've lost, of all the mistakes I've made inconsequential in comparison to my spirit.

When that happens the real me takes center stage. And what a glorious performance he gives. A sly grin oft tugging at his lips he moves ever forward, mind clear, eyes full of life, no moment too small to enjoy, no problem too big to overcome. Like Atlas, though, I seem to be unable to ever truly be free of my burdens and so the curtain closes, the mask once more at the fore."
depression,fdfc235,t3_el170m,1578358155.0,"All the time. I catch a lot of flak from some of my friends because I've been single for so long. They always tell me I just need to go for it and message people, then get real quiet when I point out how all of our conversations start. And I get it, people have lives. At the moment, I don't. All the same, I constantly question why I waste my time trying to talk to people who never bother to message me first."

depression,fcmahd7,t3_ehrota,1577768706.0,"I saw your edit, and I'm glad you're doing a bit better. I used to work with people with developmental disabilities. One morning while I was showering someone I noticed he was unusually quiet so I asked what was wrong. He was upset because he had seen on the news that someone had committed suicide. We ended up having a pretty long talk about depression. And after our talk he told me he just wished that he could help people who were feeling sad. That morning as I drove home I bawled my eyes out.

I've sat on the floor, staring at a bottle of painkillers or with a knife at my throat, wanting nothing more than everything to end, to finally be at peace. I've drank till I puked blood and then kept drinking, hoping that my body would just shut down and I'd never wake up. But I could never bring myself to go through with it.

I thought about all of that while we were talking. It completely blew my mind how someone with their own struggles could have such compassion for a complete stranger. But there he was, crying, wishing more than anything that he could have helped. It made me realize that no matter how alone I felt there was someone out there that cared."
depression,fcm8e6r,t1_fcm7o6n,1577766974.0,One of the few things I take comfort in is that I've managed to make it this far without a whole lot of help.

But there's also a lot of people who can't understand just how hard it is dealing with that stuff.

depression,fcapxgt,t1_fcabjqp,1577574240.0,That sounds like a good plan for the day. It's easy to get overwhelmed when so many big things are happening. But sometimes dialing it back and focusing on the things right in front of you can help you catch your breath and sort your thoughts out.
depression,fc9r7vr,t3_egrutg,1577556994.0,I used to call off at Wal-Mart claiming that I had a migraine when I was just depressed. Currently training at a job I started recently and trying to convince myself to go into work has been a nightmare.
depression,fc9q260,t3_egr1c1,1577556474.0,"Last year I got really close to someone for the first time in years. I tried to convince myself for months that I should just go for it and ask her out. We had such great chemistry. When we were together we laughed and joked and had an absolute blast. We even shared some life experience so it was so easy to talk about stuff. But when I finally worked up the courage to ask her out she just up and disappeared.

Fast forward 18 months, someone else comes along. Someone that I get along with amazingly well, that makes me laugh and smile, that I can talk to about everything (including addiction, anxiety, and depression). The difference is that this time I actually had a shot. We spent some time together, held hands, cuddled, kissed. It was amazing and felt like the start of something really great. But then a week ago the messages just stopped.

I don't know. I know these things happen sometimes and that in instances like this we pretty much never wind up getting answers. Still, it fucking hurts to wait so long for someone to come along that makes you feel like this only for them to disappear. Just wish I could catch a break after everything I've been through and overcome."
depression,fc9mq51,t3_egoxgv,1577555000.0,"At my lowest point I forced myself to stop looking for big moments or experiences and started focusing on the little things.

I get 3 day weekends now since I work 10s, but at this point the damage is done. Have a few logs in the fire right now so I decided to put my well-being first and put in my two weeks. Probably should wait till I have an offer set in stone but burn out and depression are no joke."

To be honest, I'm not really sure what changed. But at some point I realized that things weren't getting to me like they had been. Instead of instantly falling into a mental cage every time something didn't go my way or how I expected it to, I was actually trying to process and unpack things.

Get a huge kick out of it, though. Not to mention eviscerating someone flying through the air with a palm of death is ridiculously satisfying."
DivinityOriginalSin,f0wzcq1,t1_f0wyrhj,1569017317.0,"I was absolutely rolling during that quest. DOS2 was my buddy's entry into the series and he was crying over his mic the entire time. I've only beat the game solo, but damn is co-op a blast."
DivinityOriginalSin,f0wz6dn,t3_d6pbs0,1569017179.0,"Funny story. During my last run I decided to open a chest with a fireball. Just as the fireball was let loose a seeker in the camp decided to check the flowers over by the pretty lockbox. Naturally he was none too pleased with his absent-minded perusing being interrupted by a scalding hot orb of death and a fight ensued.

Given that this fight entailed every last seeker assembled I was okay with reloading. Until I saw that my previous save was quite some time prior. So with a shrug I laid seige to the seekers, ultimately walking away from a pile of smouldering, poisoned corpses that had been picked clean of all their valuables."
DivinityOriginalSin,f0wy48r,t1_f0wxbzg,1569016373.0,"I try to be a decent human being in real life so when I play video games I tend to be an absolute monster lol. One of the runs I started but never finished basically eradicated everything in Fort Joy. They, unsurprisingly, wound up being quite rich."
DivinityOriginalSin,f0wx3l4,t1_f0wusou,1569015772.0,"I restarted so many times trying different characters and builds. The one that finally broke through and saw me to the end, though, did exactly this. Because that character and his companion were huge assholes."
DivinityOriginalSin,f0wvuom,t1_f0wpt4u,1569015064.0,And just when I thought I had gotten all of these out of my brain...
depression,f0qkle6,t3_d65d1s,1568861442.0,"I wake up every night and just stare up into darkness (I work overnights) wondering how everything got so bad again. I stay like that for 10-15 minutes, mind wandering, trying to unpack and sift through all the muck. Then I drag myself out of bed and head to work, that all-too-familiar sense of dread and hopelessness chipping away."
Nightshift,ezpagqo,t3_d1mfev,1568036701.0,"I'm more apt to drink on my days off, but I work in the mental health field so some days coming home and having a few drinks is extremely cathartic. People understand the concept of nightshift, but I'm not sure how many truly understand the reality of working nightshift. It certainly has its downsides. But working nights means we also have to make things work for us."
Anxiety,ez8rght,t3_d02jdo,1567755437.0,It took me tearing my meniscus and wrecking my back to request a less demanding site at work. After getting fired from Wal-Mart a couple years ago I pretty much swore to myself that I would be someone that would work until I dropped. The last couple months have been a real eye opener though. I totally understand the guilt side of things. But at the end of the day we have to take care of ourselves.
Nightshift,ez8or68,t3_d0a2as,1567751604.0,I'm actually switching sites at work after I finish up on Sun due to some health issues. Going to be much easier on me physically but flips my days of the week and slightly tweaks my hours. I fully anticipate this to be me in the coming weeks/months lol.
Nightshift,ez4tjje,t1_ez4175g,1567691893.0,Pretty much everyone I work with says this agency is the only place they've ever worked that doesn't do a differential. Sadly just one issue on a growing list.
Nightshift,eyzg1nj,t3_czhqfc,1567616911.0,"Wait, you guys are getting paid more? What the hell. All jokes aside I like 3rd shift. It's generally more peaceful, and I don't have to deal with people as much. So it's all kosher in my book."
Nightshift,ewalvyx,t3_cnd3ok,1565246502.0,"A whole whopping 0%. It's been discussed to death at the agency I work at, but it'll probably never happen. And the biggest reason I don't see it happening is because of the night shift employees. Most sleep, half-ass their job, or both. Pisses me off because I work at the agency's most demanding house, of which there are 15, and work like a dog. But at least I get another 0% to my pay for working at such a difficult site. Also, yes, I am looking for a different job lol."
depression,ewalatw,t1_ew7xn7o,1565246127.0,I'm house sitting for a buddy starting tomorrow. He has 3 cats and a dog. Actually really looking forward to not being in an empty house for a week.
depression,eurgf0u,t3_ch5k91,1563993789.0,"I feel like I'm sitting in a really comfy chair at a bus stop. I see everyone get on, smiling and laughing, excited to see what's down the road, the promise of tomorrow and all its wonders seemingly just around the bend. And I see them come back.

Some aren't much different than when they left, the same smile, the same laughter carrying them back onto the platform. Others bear a worn smile, their shoulders slightly drooped, the lines around their eyes deeper than when last you saw them, the weight of the road plain for those with the eyes to see it. Yet whether their journeys were what they expected or something else entirely, they all bring back stories, they all bring back memories.

Most pay me no mind, no doubt eager to be reunited with those dearest to them. To share in the triumphs and tribulations of every bump, of every turn they navigated. Occasionally, though, someone will stop, the question always the same: weren't you here when I left? And with a practiced smile I repeat myself for what must be the hundredth time. ""My bus is just running a little late. It'll be here any time now."" And just like that they're gone, the bustle of the bus stop drowning out their steps, the crowd quickly hiding them from view, my chair seemingly clinging to me ever tighter."
depression,erigikj,t3_c23268,1560897080.0,Enjoy it. Hope you have a good day. Sending positive vibes from down south.
Nightshift,er75io6,t3_c0idud,1560567659.0,"Enjoy. I go in tonight midnight to 10 am, and then I'm off for 9 days."
Dreams,eqwhnt6,t3_bzlt9p,1560357207.0,"I tried years ago to teach myself to lucid dream. Could never pull it off. Having crazy, vivd dreams though at will sounds awesome."
addiction,eqwfj5l,t3_bzhfkb,1560356514.0,"Way to go. Congrats on 4 months and here's to 4 more. Remember that it all starts with a single step, which is the hardest one. Before you know it months will turn to years."
Vaping,eqwe8oa,t3_bzml2b,1560356112.0,"I have a Legend, as well as a Smoant Cylon. Absolutely love both of them."
Nightshift,eqwcvt4,t3_bznppb,1560355686.0,"Where I work I actually stay just as busy as the day staff, which has been a big help. I know when I was at Wal-Mart, though, my shifts were so boring cause it was just stocking crap on shelves. I lead a much healthier lifestyle now and put a big emphasis on getting enough sleep, which has helped tremendously."
rpg_gamers,eqvmxq2,t1_eqteosx,1560347169.0,"Persona was one that made me care about my teammates and want to spend time with them in-game. I always appreciate a strong story and an engrossing main character. But having an interest in supporting cast members helps so much with immersion. At some point I want to get my hands on Pillars of Eternity. I'm not great at cRPGs, but I've read the story is fantastic and that the pre-made NPCs are pretty awesome."
rpg_gamers,eqte89j,t1_eqtdrhs,1560309768.0,"I went back to the first Dishonored after finishing Persona 5. And something about Persona made it feel quite hollow to simply be a mass murderer in the shadows. When I played through the DLC I actually aimed to be more of non-lethal ghost, which I found particularly satisfying."
rpg_gamers,eqtdgp7,t1_eqtco2r,1560309226.0,"Glad to hear it. I liked Dishonored 1, but I'm hoping 2 pulls me in a bit more. Still looking forward to getting my teeth into the Bioshock games even more though."
rpg_gamers,eqork9y,t1_eqor2a4,1560191822.0,Referring to The Force Unleashed? Cause I sadly have not played them.
rpg_gamers,eqj8xv5,t1_eqgxon8,1560100929.0,I second this. Hands down some of the best combat. And who doesn't love just randomly chucking people off of cliffs or large rocks?
