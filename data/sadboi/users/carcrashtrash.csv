Sleepparalysis,fqbvyym,t3_ghzxck,1589244995.0,"Idk but I've started having a laugh with mine, joking about even in your mind tends to ease the anxiety and makes things a lot chiller. Last time I had SP the demon ended up checking how long I'd been under and cracking jokes about the weather lmao. I'd imagine aggression might make it worse as it increases adrenaline"

BPD,fkb9yck,t3_fhhrld,1584029032.0,"Seconding therapy, sometimes it can be subconscious stuff you're not dealing with. I'll feel like that for a while, then something will trigger a crying session and it'll all come out and I feel a lot better after!"
Sleepparalysis,fkb9nru,t3_fhi9di,1584028869.0,What's your preferred technique for inducing SP?
ADHD,fkb98sw,t1_fkaz0jc,1584028638.0,"Ah okay, this is a silly question but can GPs diagnose and prescribe meds? I really want a proper diagnosis to bring to my university for evidence. Thanks for the advice üòä"
BPD,fkb8x91,t3_fhiat5,1584028462.0,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. I've been through the same thing and it's one of the worst feelings ever, and it's going to take some time to be okay with it. Just wanted you to know from experience, this isn't about you not being enough, or not being good enough.

Sometimes unfortunately, you can do all you can and it's still not right for the other person. But this doesn't say anything about you as a person, it doesn't mean you're not lovable or worthy of being loved. Do you really want to be with someone who doesn't treat you like you should be treated? It's so tempting with BPD to base your worth off others, but your priority should be yourself.

I know this won't help right now, but for now try to make the priority yourself. Treat yourself like you'd treat a friend going through the same thing. Buy yourself something nice, eat your favourite food, watch your favourite shows. You existed before him, and you will exist after him. No silly guy needs to decide your fate, and I promise you it will get better ‚ù§Ô∏è

Do whatever you need to do to cope. Since you know how you usually react to this sadness, try to anticipate triggers and find distractions. Talk to someone you trust, and if you can't, my messages are always open.

You are strong and worthy, and I believe in you."
BPD,fk97n9g,t3_fh6sy3,1583970398.0,"Love this! I think sometimes it's so easy to forget that in the grand scheme of this world, setbacks are just a drop in the ocean and its only us that takes them so seriously. Definitely gonna try this üòä"
BPD,fk9736o,t3_fh2drc,1583970063.0,"This is me! I've never identified with the BPD stereotype of being outwardly loud and dramatic, it's always been quiet and internalised for me.

I definitely have that contrast of personality where if you asked me to describe myself, I couldn't. I'm painfully shy but super confident. I'm generous but selfish. I'm panicky but chill. Mutually exclusive terms but I seem to embody them all, depending on the situation. That's one of the more frustrating parts of BPD for me; never quite knowing who you are or what you're capable of. But I guess it keeps things suspenseful üòÇ"
depression,fk81yrc,t3_fgxzqu,1583947839.0,"I've already lived through so many 'apocalypses' and scares that I'm numb to any more scaremongering. This isn't the end of the world, though obviously it's best to try and stop the spread as much as possible. Generally I'm just apathetic about it and it annoys me to see the mass hysteria"
BPD,fk66gi8,t1_fk64biw,1583894693.0,this is the biggest mood I've seen so far
Sleepparalysis,fk553ar,t3_fghs73,1583873625.0,"I've got quite a bit of experience with lucid dreaming, but I'm terrible with scene changes. I always have to create a plausible transition to another scene, like walking through a door, rather than just closing my eyes and visualising. Not much more advice on that I'm afraid.

Now when it comes to maintaining a lucid dream, I've found your brain will normally respond to requests. When you're starting to wake up, it will feel like the dream is getting blurry, out of control etc.

When I start to feel that, I look down at my hands, clap, and demand 'clarity' out loud. Just saying the word clarity out loud, with conviction, centres you and brings your brain back to the dream. I do this several times, sometimes even when it's not needed, and it's never failed me so far. 

Flying: our brain is still clinging to the laws of physics, even in lucid dreams where we know anything is possible. To get past that mental block, I do one or both of the following :

1) ease myself into it gradually. A common technique is to run and jump as you go, and try and jump for longer each time. Eventually, you should be able to lift off the ground permanently. 

2) get yourself a jetpack. This works because our brain now knows that flying is physically possible and thus its much easier to do it. Stand on the edge of a cliff, use the jetpack to fly off. Or give yourself wings if that works. 

Hope this all helps! üòä"
agender,fk42ldo,t3_fgek1e,1583851984.0,"You sound agender to me, and are entirely valid in whatever you feel comfortable with. I'm agender but am fine with female pronouns, as I've been socialised as female, but much like you I hate gendered nouns like woman, girl etc. There is no pressure to look androgynous either; I am highly femme presenting, love skirts and makeup etc. 

The thing to remember is there isn't a checklist you have to complete to be agender. Some people are fine with gendered pronouns, some (like me) feel little or no dysphoria. But we all have a shared experience in feeling that we have no gender, or that gender doesn't matter or apply to us. 

You are valid and if this feels like a label that speaks to you, then don't worry about small details üòä"
BPD,fk3uf9n,t1_fk3u6bp,1583846536.0,"Definitely, like it takes being burnt out to recover in a way. It's a difficult and I often feel like I SHOULD have someone there to obsess over, but can recognise that it's the BPD talking and needing something to latch onto - hopefully by starving it, something good will happen. Well done for focusing on recovery and best of luck üòä"
