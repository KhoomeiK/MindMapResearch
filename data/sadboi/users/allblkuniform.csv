Anyway if you don’t know what I’m talking about, ignore that, and just know that we are actually here for you. Much love and stay safe!"

bipolar2,fhhru6u,t1_fhh9qh6,1581610498.0,"I too was expelled from preschool and kindergarten! Was sent to alternative school twice, got arrested twice, stole and totaled my dads car, and almost failed a grade due to skipping class, all under the age of 15...BUT at the age of 16 I turned it around, stopped all the bullshit, graduated high school a year early and then college at 20. I won’t get into all my wildness as an adult lol, but I’m almost 27 and very stable now, with my life together (still dealing with some sins from my past)

All that to say, that it definitely presented as a child but I didn’t realize it until my proper diagnosis at 24."
bipolar2,f93ug8v,t3_e3id2k,1575068822.0,"I’ve been on my meds for a while and they still make me nauseous if I take them in the morning. Try taking them at night, or after dinner. I also take something to help me sleep so I feel like that combo helps me at least get through the nausea without throwing up. Good luck!!"

BipolarReddit,ezs9rid,t3_d1yeyf,1568085431.0,I literally did this last night at a girls going away party. She had a pill addiction and is in recovery so we all took shots out of her old pill bottles.
bipolar2,ezs8r5v,t3_d1q2sd,1568084904.0,"Got some criticism for being to chatty at work. Since I’m freelance and at the bottom of the today pole, the same rules don’t apply to everyone. My agent said that my work is great, I’m just too chatty sometimes. Which isn’t the worst thing in the world, but it makes me feel like no one was to work with me and that I’m awful at my job. I know it’s combination of me needing to chill out on the socializing, knowing that others can talk because they’re in higher positions, and also that sometimes people just don’t like you. Point is I cried in silence all the way home and I’m trying really hard not to internalize it. And like most of us, I tend to hermit when I’m down or overshare and be a social butterfly when I’m up (and the feedback I got what definitely from jobs where I was happy/hypo at the time, so it makes sense). How do you guys deal with criticism and managing how you interact with people at work?

Ps, self awareness is a bitch with this disease."
