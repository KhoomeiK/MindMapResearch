I would also like to add the thought process behind the upvote and the values you have are rather interesting in a poetic sense. I dont feel as though you overanalyze anything In this particular situation anyway. Also the poetic sense I was referring to, was the value in which you have behind a upvote its beautiful. Thank you for satisfying my curiosity it's very much appreciated."
BorderlinePDisorder,fq7rasn,t1_fq418qp,1589150609.0,Beautifully said :) thank you.
BorderlinePDisorder,fq7r76u,t1_fq49fhf,1589150551.0,"I really appreciate you, reaching out to me with such a beautiful offer of kindness, making the connection and the comfort of relatability. I think for now I'll appreciate the beauty of not diving too deep into my issues on a person level and allow this platform to be a form of anonymous expression. However I dont say this lightly and i really appreciate you, thank you."
BorderlinePDisorder,fq7qxfe,t1_fq69h3k,1589150396.0,"I'm curious as to why you decided to mention you didnt feel right in upvoting this? I have my own assumptions but, if you feel that you are willing or able to Express yourself as to why you felt that way :). I put a smile because my post wasnt about the upvote due to the fact I just found reddit four or five days ago. But I'm curious as to why me expressing my struggle leaves you feeling not right about it. I know this is a situation where you might feel theres no point in responding but I want you to know that I'm not salty I'm just really curious."
mentalillness,fq3rvh9,t3_gggi9p,1589069465.0,"I've been in a relationship for 5 years and I've made so many poor choices and I believe it's because I struggle alot with my own demons I never faced or really knee about, so the longest time I believe I became extremely co dependent. Which wasnt heathly. I've eventually changed that, however recently, well not recently but for the past 8months I been realizing that time really the right person for my loved one and as much as I love them I dont see us staying together and I truly believe it's because I wasnt able to love correctly at the beginning of our relationship and my choices affected the reality I live in now :( so yes I do feel unworthy of love."

BorderlinePDisorder,fpfhv1k,t3_gd1bym,1588571708.0,"Yeah I can understand the disheartening part of that. Main thing is to remain positive and loving towards yourself, trust as you lay there that you'll fall asleep when it's time and try not to get worked up about it."

ottawa,fperl6k,t1_fper3m6,1588553444.0,I was once in the loop of payday loans because I had just started a job after being laid off and I need to make my bills and couldn't wait the 2weeks for my frist pay. It took me over 4months to break free from that situation and it was unbearable but I couldn't afford to go with out ot even though I was loosing money eventually I was able to make what i was borrowing less and less but it's really hard if you enter it and they make it that way on purpose.

ottawa,fpeqi52,t3_gcy5pm,1588552789.0,"You need to put them in a box outside. Make sure that you got all of them because the mother is going to RIP into your roof if you didnt. If you are able to go on the roof and wait for the mother to come out at night to the aid of the baby's that would be perfect once shes out I would patch the hole and say good bye to them. 

However that being said if you missed any babies in the attic you gave two problems the mother destroying the roof to get back in or in the summer when the body starts to stink and trust me it will you'll have a whole new problem."

mentalillness,fpe8n98,t3_gcszpe,1588542554.0,"I've never really understood the reason for these feelings. I feel like I've progressed alot on myself in the years, being able to identify why I am the way I am. But I have to admit the battle of the changes of moods makes social interactions at time with my loved ones a chore. I try my hardest but I have issues and I think its hard for them to understand that because on a regular basis you wouldnt know that I struggle. Even my girlfriend of five years forget that sometimes I am the way I am for the reasons we know. I've done some hars, hard work on myself but the ""out of nowhere"" still applies to me today. :("
askTO,fpdsosr,t3_gc02ca,1588533443.0,"What exactly do you mean by validating the sin? Theres a way to check mathematically if the sin you are using is an actual sin. 
I can send you the equation if that's what you like to see, however if you were receiving payroll with the sin you are using and now it isnt working then unfortunately you have to contact the government. I have a number you can use for that if you would like that as well. 
You have to have worked a certain amount of hours aswell. But if you are eligible for ei then you are more then likely eligible for the package."
