sffpc,fqkrax8,t1_fqkj2kh,1589434113.0,"Thanks for the in-depth answer! It really is risky to have a focus on availability, and be dependent on someone else's supply in the same breath.

Just some more thoughts - overclockers UK and caseking both offer cooler bundles for the Dan A4. They sell like crazy, but when they're sold out there's still the raw case available as well.

Best case scenario for the beginning, pun intended - you release the case on its own first, demand is ramping up, and suddenly you're another player on this form factor's market, proving that there is demand. You provide these numbers to PSU manufacturers and hopefully they want a slice of the pie.

Either way, I would love to see you succeed in any endeavor you choose on the sff market. Cheers!"

The Viper Mini however, is on the very edge of being too small for me for grip width alone. If it was just a bit wider, it would be 110% endgame.

I guess it just depends on how exactly you grip the mouse. Try it out, be really picky, and send it back if you can't use it. I place my bets on letting my hand adjust to the smaller dimensions."

Instead of really hugging that rock, you practically stood beside it while you took shots at the wraith. Only expose as much of your hitbox as you need to in order to get the LoS on the opponent, not a smidge more.

While you were in the open, you maybe could've incorporated more crouch spamming to make it even harder for the opponent to predict your movement.
Jumping is bad, because it sends you on a predictable, parabolic rail.
