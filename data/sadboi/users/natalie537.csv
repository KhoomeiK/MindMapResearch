AskReddit,fjmyzox,t1_fjl8oeu,1583491072.0,I was on a bus on my way to a summer camp. We were about 5min into the trip when the buss slams the breaks. Our summer camp leader was ironically in the middle of saying “please don’t stand up or you risk flying forwards if the bus breaks” He slams backwards headfirst and cracks the entire front window. He stood up and gestured to the window and said “see what I mean”

It got stuck in his throat and he just stood extremely still while not being able to breath. My mom tried to reach into his throat to either push it down or take it out. I think there are better techniques to use for dogs if they’re choking and stuff. We were all really panicked when it happened. That stuffs scary
PetTheDamnDog,fh4ft4k,t3_f180u6,1581278223.0,Ok just to be clear. I ROUGHLY translated the caption in the original video as the title. Maybe it sounds a bit harsher in English than what it is in Swedish
