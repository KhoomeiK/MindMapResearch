As long as you and your partner are clear and honest about your emotions and expectations, I see no reason why you cannot add another person in. However: all parties are equal in this, so be sure your bf and any potential girlfriend know exactly what is expected. Discussion and consent will be extremely important moving forward, and you will have to become an expert in being considerate and communicative. Don't be afraid to take steps back and place things on hold so all parties can breathe. Dont forget that any third person is a human being with flaws who has the right to voice their own concerns and set their own boundaries. I hope you find a happy balance <3"

My partner and I do ""spoiling days"" which are focused entirely on one of us being relaxed and warmed up slowly. If you are interested I would have an evening planned with some a or b options for her so she can practice verbalizing her preferences out loud. Like ""its bubble bath time do you want a jasmine bath bomb or a eucalyptus one? White wine or red wine? Would you like me to scrub your back? Jazz or soul for background music? Would you like a massage on your back or the feet first? Would you like boob play or oral?"" You may want to remove actual sex from the equation at first as it may add tension or a pressure to perform.

Double spoiling days are also a thing, where my partner and I trade off the massages and favors, scrub eachother in the bath, etc. These little bonding activities really help us connect, and even if we dont have sex that need for physical touch and affection is fulfilled.

Best of luck!"
childfree,fjajp9e,t3_fc0wt9,1583174865.0,"Hey OP, so sorry you had to go through this. Its rough to have your heart set on something and then have reality crush all your expectations. Totally understand if you swear off pets from now on, but IF you ever find yourself wishing you had something to care for that is less intense than a puppy here are some options to consider:

Adult Cat - a cat who already has their personality formed would be best so you can find a good fit. Many cats are aloof yet loving and very self sufficient as other redditors have mentioned.


Leopard Gecko - so easy after initial set up, as adults they eat a few worms about every other day, make you work to earn their affection, may wake you up because they are most active at night.


Corn Snake - if you dont have a phobia snakes are wonderfully low maintenance pets. Corn snakes stay small, eat a small mouse once a week, otherwise will just laze around be cute and go ""sssss""


Succulent Garden! - succulents are amazing plants and I talk to them just like my pets so I'm including them here. Water once every 2 weeks and keep in bright sunlight, they make even bloom for you which is always amazing to watch.


No matter what, I hope you take the time to rest and recover from your anxiety filled experience. Best of luck finding a calming way to indulge your nurturing side. <3"

The way I was told the story, a woman fell in love with a young bachelor who came to her village. Because she was beautiful she caught his attention, and they bore children together. However over time the man became a player, and would take off for long periods of time. His visits became less about his now aging (wife? babymomma?) And more for his children.

In a jealous rage the woman flung her children into a river. Upon realizing what she has done she beings to sob and cry out for them, chasing them down the river until she trips and falls, killing herself.

Legend says that she is still chasing after them. Children are urged to return home quickly at nightfall lest she catch you, mistaking you for one of her own. Shes supposed to leave deep gouging wounds if she catches you with her long ghostly fingers. And if you cant get away, she drags you back to the river."

Then I realized my degree program was slowly and literally killing me via stress. I had panic attacks with vomiting nearly daily but it's somehow so easy to convince yourself that it's no big deal. Until you stop functioning.

I finally made the choice to drop out, and I found a job working with animals instead of the teaching I had been doing (better pay too!)

Now my work is itself a form a therapy because I find that animal care recharges my mental energy. Finally after 3 years I feel like I'm firmly in the process of recovery.
