Besides, there's no guidelines on how to be trans, nor there is a criteria to follow to ""diagnose"" someone as transgender. And that brings us to the problem of not being trans enough. And there's chasers too. And people who claim they're trans but in reality they are not. There is gay guys who say trans women aren't real. All those sh*t hits hard. And if I read earlier in the morning something bad, I will be less open when talking about sensitive subjects. I have some homophobia too. And it hurts bc I'm a woman and I have a wife. It hurts bc I'm trans and people often think I'm just a gay guy. I haven't been able to get a real job because well, you know, I'm trans, and according to some people, that makes me less efficient and less productive than cis people. Also, the more you interact with other trans people, the more you get biased. You're prone to get angry more often. That doesn't helps either. But I'm trying. I promise you I'm really trying. Sometimes I get mad. But also sometimes I get enough courage to apologise. And most people are not willing to ask for perdon.

Many couples end splitting up after someone comes out as trans, but I think good communication is key to find what's best for you as a couple.

There have always been ethnic minorities in almost all countries, and almost all of them treat them the same way. They are seen as second class citizens, if you don't believe me, just ask turkey about the kurds, or even better, ask Israel about Palestinians. This has nothing to do with the riots, since the ones protesting are indeed Chinese. So yeah, as any other ethnic group, tibetans want to have their own country, same thing with Palestinians, but the ruling govt is never willing to do that. It doesn't matter if they are the cccp, or the Israeli government, the thing is the same.

Now, Taiwan is a completely different story. The kuomintang was not an ethnic minority, they were indeed Chinese, but they had different povs as how China should be ruled. They fought a civil war. They lost, but as any good Chinese, they are not going to accept the truth. Besides Chiang Kai-Shiek was a dictator in the early days of Taiwan. He was not so different to Mao. He was authoritarian, and he didn't trust anyone, that's why he failed. You may have surveillance systems on mainland China now, but the truth is, they have existed since before the cccp.
