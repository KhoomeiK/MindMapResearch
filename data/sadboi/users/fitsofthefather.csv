psychnursing,fpmmg71,t1_fpmbx8p,1588736345.0,"Not op, but thank you for sharing. I went into nursing 100% invested in going into psych. Now that I've been in psych for 8 months (directly out of school also), I'm afraid that it's not for me-- not because I don't want to work with the patients, but because for-profit companies don't care about psych staff or patients. We can't give good care even if we wanted to because the system is designed so poorly and we're drowning in paperwork. I run into many of the same problems you mentioned like unsafe staffing, unhelpful techs, and changes thrown at us constantly (that you only hear about because someone happened to mention it). 

I've been considering mother/baby or labor and delivery for a few months now. It seems like a better fit for me, at least as long as psych hospitals continue to fumble through mental health care. What do you love about mother/baby? Is it easy to transition from psych, or will I be undesirable since I haven't been using as many skills as fellow nurses from other areas? Will I take a pay cut and start all over as if I'm a new nurse? I realize I will likely need to wait until the covid-19 crisis is over. Thanks for answering if you can!"
BipolarReddit,fpmipos,t3_ge2pw7,1588733945.0,"I used to feel this way.

psychnursing,fpkkqdd,t3_gdp9fo,1588696422.0,"I'm right there with you. My favorite unit also closed. They keep putting me on the geri unit as the only nurse with 10-12 patients. I'm a new nurse and not very comfortable with geri patients; I'm afraid I'll miss something medical. A few days ago I was on the highest acuity unit (schizophrenia, psychotic D/O,  manic bipolar, assaultive patients, etc) as the only nurse with 18 patents for more than half the day before a second nurse finally came. 

We are under investigation, so the amount of work they keep piling on nurses to satisfy surveyors is absurd. They make no effort to try to figure out how to make the system easier for nurses. They just give us more work. And all of this keeps me from actually giving good patient care, because I'm too busy charting (paper, ugh). I've noticed that a lot of nurses who are able to get all their work done do so by lying about assessments, because a good assessment takes too much time. 

I got into psych because of my own mental health struggles and a desire to help this egregiously underserved population. Instead I'm just a cog in a machine that gives terrible care so some CEO's have a good quarter. I'm part of the problem, and I wish I could explain to my patient sobbing alone in her room that I DO care, I want to sit and talk with you, but I can't because... I have to chart. 

On top of all of this--- nobody respects psych nurses. There is no pride in the job. Other nurses turn their noses up at psych. We aren't even trained in therapeutic communication or coping skills or psych meds, or anything relevant to the specialty that might give us any kind of expertise at all at my job. You have to do this on your own, and many nurses just don't.  Management doesn't care if you're a good psych nurse at my job, they care if you did all your treatment plans for Tylenol. 

From the beginning I wanted psych. I am passionate about it, and eventually want to become a psych NP. But now I'm seriously second guessing this choice. I'm still in my first year as a nurse and wondering if I should jump ship and try another specialty. 

I'm sorry I totally used your post as an opportunity to vent. I just can't believe how disappointing psych nursing has been. I'm so sorry about what you're going through. I'm also the one supporting my husband and kid, and so scared to take a cut to start over in another area of nursing.

Personally I don't think you should leave nursing because of a bad psych gig. There are lots of opportunities in nursing where the pay is good but you don't have to do bedside. Being an RN opens a lot of doors. You could  work at a nurse line, or for insurance companies, or as a case manager. Might be nice just to get a chance of pace. Good luck, this situation is tough."
psychnursing,fpbvn0v,t3_gc3vsa,1588479907.0,"I think it's often true-- especially in inpatient psych. I'm a psych nurse who also has bipolar 2 and spent 15+ years severely depressed. I was hospitalized (involuntarily) once for SI, and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. I thought that by becoming a psych nurse I could make a difference and give the kind of care I needed at the time, but I can't. The for-profit hospital machine is too heartless, both to employees and patients. I'm hoping I eventually find a psych job where it actually feels like I'm helping patients. Aside from the system, there are so many psych nurses who are there for the wrong reasons. It's easy to feel jaded when the nurses don't seem to care and your Dr spends 5 minutes with you.

I also think patients get hyperfocused on the ""guinea pig"" feeling that the trial-and-error nature of psychiatry causes. Mental illness causes a lot of mistrust and negativity and hopelessness, and it's easy to turn those feelings on the psychiatry industry, especially when you can try dozens of medications and medication combinations before you get any kind of relief.... If you ever do. Intractable depression, schizophrenia, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and others can all be incredibly difficult to treat. It's very hard to hold out hope when you spend months or years trying out medications and all you get is side effects"

But it really is about time. Build up social support and seek out good people who see who you are. Let friends be the ones who validate you, not a love interest. Work on your self esteem. Pick up hobbies, learn things, master things, work hard on your career.

You'll want to max out the absorption of the troche under your tongue, and one thing you might try is breaking the troche into pieces to increase surface area for breakdown/absorption. It's ok to swallow the saliva, you just won't get as much out of ketamine that you swallow, so you want to give it time under the tongue. However I have a feeling that letting all your saliva pool in your mouth for 15 minutes is actually preventing the ketamine from being absorbed because you're diluting the fluid that sits against the mucus membranes that absorb the ketamine with your saliva. So I would try letting small amounts of saliva pool for a few minutes then swallowing. Keep repeating that until it's gone. You should be able to taste how concentrated or diluted it is in your mouth, so if it still tastes strongly of ketamine, let it sit. If it tastes ""weak"", swallow. If this doesn't help, next time try breaking up the troche into smaller pieces to start. Good luck!"
TherapeuticKetamine,fnfjuke,t1_fnfewfr,1586909463.0,"You mean you'll never get the same benefit as you do from IM or IV *if using the same amount of ketamine.* As long as the dose of sublingual is high enough to make up for the lower bioavailability of the sublingual route, you will get the same effect. Sounds like the troches just aren't a high enough dosage for OP.

Edit to add-- well I have to correct myself, it might not be possible to get the same effect if the right amount can't be absorbed just due to physical limitations/time needed for absorption. But as long the right dose can be administered in a similar amount of time, the route doesn't matter."
TherapeuticKetamine,fn4imc2,t3_fz95h3,1586642141.0,"I was on ketamine (intranasal) for 3 years, 150mg 1-3x pet week (after 6 initial infusions). The first thing I will say is: ketamine will not work if you drink alcohol. I don't know why, but I've noticed this for myself, and you'll see many others report the same thing.

The second thing I'll say is ketamine has extremely variable effects for some of us. For me, sometimes it completely reversed depression and I didn't need it for a full month. Other times it seemed useless and I wondered if it was no longer a treatment option for me. Only one thing remained consistent: however it was working, good or bad, it would probably change again in a matter of time. But you also must do some work on your part. You can't sit around eating potato chips (not saying you do, just saying). You have to try to grab on to its motivational effects when its working and eat right, don't drink, work out, meditate. It doesn't work alone, but it does help you do the things you need to do to take care of yourself. 

So give it time. Don't lose hope. There might be periods of time where it doesn't seem to work, but I'm willing to bet it will start working again at some point. You might also consider a break from it to develop sensitivity again."

In all my interviews the interviewers seemed impressed with my personal experience/passion, so please don't let your fear hold you back; your personal experience is an asset! I was offered every job I interviewed for btw, and even turned some interviews down after accepting a position.

Unfortunately some nurses go into psych nursing because they either wanted a break from medical bedside, or because they didn't do well in medical.

BipolarReddit,f7dexll,t3_dvhoym,1573614981.0,"I just had my daughter at the end of September. Like so many others, I've been terrified of passing this illness on, but eventually we decided to be a little more flexible wth birth control and see if it happened (basically switching to rhythm method only). Well it happened immediately, even though we avoided my supposed ovulation window (and I'm 35+!).  This was quite a shock, but I couldn't be happier.

Heritability of bipolar disorder is supposedly around 25%, but genetic predisposition doesn't guarantee full-blown illness, either. And while I wouldn't wish bipolar on anyone, I also know I will be much better prepared to help my daughter should she inherit it than my parents were. How many of us were raised by supportive, savvy parents? I'd guess very few. I'm certain I would have a much milder form of bipolar, if it emerged at all, had my parents handled things differently. That's the hope I cling to, but I'd also be lying if I said I have no anxiety about passing it on.

I have bipolar II and spend a lot of time in a mild depressive state (used to be more severe before ketamine therapy), but cycle through different shades of depression and periods of remission. My pregnancy was about 20% severely depressed, 40% mildly depressed, 40% remitted/euthymic. This is similar to how I am with ketamine therapy. I felt pretty amazing when euthymic and pregnant (not hypomanic though). I had a LOT of stress during my pregnancy and would guess if I hadn't, I would have had more frequent/longer good phases.

I waa on lithium 600mg daily and quit immediately with a positive pregnancy test at 3 weeks. Lithium has always been more insurance against really bad episodes than truly stabilizing, and I don't think stopping it mattered.

I was also on ketamine intranasal 2x a week. It was rough not having this failsafe to pull me out of episodes, but I still felt better (mostly- see below) unmedicated and pregnant than I ever have (mostly) unmedicated and not-pregnant.

I was also on clonidine to regulate sleep/anxiety, and stayed on it during my pregnancy. This probably helped keep me stable-iish since my wacky sleep cycles make me more ill. I stopped it after giving birth though, because I can't take something to sleep with this little milk goblin waking me up every 2 hours!

The postpartum period has been far better than I expected. I've adjusted just fine to sleeping in 2 hour shifts...way, way betrer than I expected.  Sure I was hormonal after (felt like severe PMS); I cried, I snapped at my husband, I was exhausted, my body felt war-torn, but as someone prone to depression I was so happy that it really wasn't that bad. Mostly it's been waves of milder depression, which I can handle. And having this little person to focus on me helps give me purpose and motivation, which I think keeps me from sinking deeper into a deeper depression. 

I was so curious about other people's experiences as parents with bipolar, and I think it's so important we help inform each other. I wanted to share my (so far) positive experience to give others hope. I should note that my husband is extremely supportive and helpful; I don't think this would have gone as well without him.

I'm so happy she happened to me."

It sounds like you might benefit from shifting your journaling focus from ""letting it all out"" to a more Problem-Solving focus. Examine your life more like a therapist or life coach might. For example, after venting about a problem, explore ways you might be able to handle that problem better in the future (coping skills? Changing perspective? Seeking help sooner?). With the spending issue for instance, write out some parameters to look out for that signal your spending is getting out of control and you need to ""check in"" with yourself, a friend, or professional for some perspective.

Goal-setting, examining/recognizing triggers, defining coping skills and how you might use them next time, and gratitude journaling (simply writing things you're grateful for) are all useful in turning your journal into a tool for wellness rather than a trigger itself."

One thing I've learned is ""get it out of your head and onto paper."" You have to accept that you have a disability that requires structure and support systems in place in order for you to function like other people. You do not have to be ashamed of this, just take charge and figure out what your systems are. Here are some examples: a running to-do list like in Google Tasks, a strictly planned-out hourly schedule, copious post-it notes, checklists for each task, organized file folders for things to start/ finish/copy/fax/get signatures etc. What works for you, and what do you need to move you through the day? Organize your office and your time so you aren't constantly juggling everything inside your brain, because our brains are no good at juggling!

In my experience, the more you organize/plan externally, the less trouble you will have. And if your systems work, people will actually see you as organized and on top of things rather than not."
