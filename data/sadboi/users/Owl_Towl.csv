Tl;dr  saving and loading is supported by the lore, all possible outcomes are happen, and everything in existence is a dream. This is actual lore written by Michael Kirkebride who took iirc took a shit ton of acid.    
    
All the gods and stuff were created by entities that weren't blinked out of existence by acknowledging they're all a figment of a dream, like the tribunal. Example of entities that were blinked out are the dwemer, although this is often disputed by lore hounds because entities blinked out are erased in the past, present and future, and ofc they leave the ruins behind.    
    
Also they all got blinked out because they somehow share knowledge in unity. Not quite sure how, and when they activated the numidium it acknowledged the God head, and because of that they all did- thus, no dwemer, except cragronac or something... But he was in another plane of existence at the time--I dunno."

See Godhead and Dragon breaks.    
    
Long story short saving & reloading is part of the story, and all of the games and the worlds are dreamed by a man called the god head, and when a character recognises this they become blinked out of existence, like the dwemer.    
If the entity manages to comprehend this, they become God-like beings, like the tribunal."
