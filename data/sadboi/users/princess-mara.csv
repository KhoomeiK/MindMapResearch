DeadBedrooms,f0yh6ad,t1_f0xzmoy,1569070382.0,"As someone who helped a partner through a severe depression, he‚Äôs now doing great - and I‚Äôm resentful and unhappy because I spent years caretaking and being sexually rejected. If you leave now, and he eventually gets his mental health under control and his libido back, you can re-evaluate, without having spent those years being miserable. And if he never improves, you will be free and living your life."

Anxiety,ez2oema,t3_czqtqt,1567657312.0,"Yes. I had two endoscopies and countless doctor‚Äôs visits with no relief from stomach pain. Then I left my horrible job with an abusive boss and the stomachaches disappeared. I still get them during periods of extreme stress, though."
DeadBedrooms,ez2m9h2,t3_czqg60,1567656679.0,"Honestly, she shared an incredibly common female fantasy. She wants to feel desired by a lot of attractive guys and, if she‚Äôs someone who experiences responsive desire, this fantasy allows her to feel pursued and desired. My opinion is that the main turn-on for most women is feeling desired, and not only by the person who is sort of ‚Äúobligated‚Äù to tell them they‚Äôre attractive, etc.  After going through such a traumatic experience with your child and probably having some body image issues, it might be nice to fantasize about being generally desirable in a no-strings-attached, emotionally uninvolved scenario. I really don‚Äôt think you should ask people their fantasies if you aren‚Äôt ready to hear something you didn‚Äôt expect. She can‚Äôt control what turns her on any more than you can.

Also, if she‚Äôs not orgasming during sex, that‚Äôs probably part of why she‚Äôs not banging down the door for more. 

It sounds like you both need a lot of work on your communication skills, whether or not you remain together."
