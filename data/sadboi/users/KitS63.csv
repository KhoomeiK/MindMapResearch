mentalhealth,epqqgs6,t1_eppnwlc,1559410507.0,The agency I contract with utilizes telemedicine. We even have local clients within a 15 min drive who just don't feel like leaving the house that utilize it occasionally. We have good results with it. We try to make therapy as accessible as possible. Accept all government insurance and 12 private and waive co-pays. I think face to face interaction definitely has advantages but this is another option. We're in Ohio and know we have one client in Oklahoma that's getting good outcomes.
therapydogs,epkd6ui,t3_buicxu,1559272515.0,"I work with my therapy dog in my full-time employment. With me 24/7. You really need to look at a viable career that you can incorporate your dog into as a tool. One very viable option is the social services field which you kinda somewhat do already. The next question is if you are working for an employer, whos liable? As correctly mentioned previously, therapy dog certification bodies will only cover your volunteer hours. My work is not in social services but as a support to them. We provide a valuable tool that assists  therapists in getting results from clients. A tool that they want but don't have to feed, pick up poop, groom, bathe, take to the vet or be liable for cause that's on my employer. Find a career your passionate about and ask yourself how you can incorporate your dog into that work. Liability will always be the million dollar question for any organization. It's a Risk Managers greatest fear."
