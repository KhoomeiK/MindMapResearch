I've started to losing friends, our connection was being worse and worse but somehow I managed to keep it.
Then I met this girl I fell in love in a moment, she was the only one I could think about, so I left my friends for her. Our relationship lasted for more than a year and then she cheated on me so I left her.
Now im in a college so finding friends in a new place is kind of hard and I dont know what to do.
Ive lost contact with my hometown friendsand everything is fucked up now.
Also Ive lost one of my best friends because of I fell into alcoholism, Ive drunk more and more and started to cut our connection. Now we live in the ssme city and for over 3 months we couldnt find a day when we could meet.
Life is fucked up.

Im from Poland and my english is not well, so if i made any mistakes please correct me"
