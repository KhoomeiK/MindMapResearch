povertyfinance,fnuyejz,t3_g3zpfm,1587274529.0,Why not try tackling the small debt first and then moving to the larger debts as you ladder through them? It will hopefully give you the confidence to pay them off and move away from purely saving.
povertyfinance,fnuy69l,t3_g40jj6,1587274334.0,"Congrats! My husband and I have just fallen on our feet in a similar way. If you haven’t already, sit down and start a budget. It makes the new money “real” and stops you from accidentally overspending on the high of your new security. Congrats, once again!"
povertyfinance,fn1xw9j,t1_fn1tphx,1586572779.0,"Ha! That's a great idea. And I like the physical nature of it, so much of what we do with money is virtual now. 

The temptation to (unwittingly even) overspend is definitely something I'm going to have to fight against. Thankfully most of our ""big purchases"" were what we took care of when he did get some work: a fridge, washing machine, bed etc. We bought a bed last year after sleeping on the floor or a broken old many-hand mattress for years. It  was a huge milestone for us. This feels similar.  

Recognising that poverty causes trauma is a tough one. Thank you for saying that. I'll admit I welled up a bit, having my feelings and experience acknowledged like that. It meant a lot, thank you."
povertyfinance,fn1rpci,t1_fn1nbck,1586568549.0,"Thanks u/Mewseido and u/Meghanshadow for such grounding and logical advice. This makes sense. 

I didn't realise that thing about the cc limit changing, good to know, and I'm sorry to hear that happened to you Meghanshadow! 

I'll definitely update once we have the emergency fund and cc paid off etc, Mewseido. I'm sure I'll have more questions. This is uncharted yet exciting territory for us."
povertyfinance,fn1nbck,t1_fn1c6yy,1586565712.0,This is a great plan. Thank you so much! I think we've managed to keep the diet \*okay\* but I'm excited to add in some more fresh ingredients. Building an emergency fund is definitely a priority as we did end up having to use the one we had. May I ask why you suggest emergency fund before cc?
povertyfinance,fn17rnc,t3_fyo9cy,1586556477.0,"Also, I just wanted to add a huge thanks to this sub. Long time lurker and it’s gotten me through some pretty dark times. So thank you."
farming,fl9kjqo,t1_fl908g5,1584959848.0,Thank you!!! Yeah he changes into coveralls etc but the smell permeates into everything. I’ll give the vinegar and scent beads a go.
curlyhair,fgeqfrj,t3_ey1q3v,1580706510.0,"Left is before. Right is after. 

Growing out a buzz cut and it’s finally getting to the point where it is wanting to start curling. Unfortunately this meant just a bunch of C’s coming out of my head like a crazy cartoon character! Did some research and decided to try CG. My hair completely relaxed into a textured pixie and I can see the curl starting to come through in a “nice” way. 

Routine: 

Washed with Kevin Murphy Hydrate Me Wash (I believe it is CG friendly? I have a huge bottle of it that’s nearly empty and will probably change to something else after for a low poo). I was already mostly co-washing with the KM rinse so will probably try that with my new conditioner. 

S2C with Garnier Fructis Hair Food (the Goji one although I don’t have coloured hair). Washed out with cool water. Added a 5c piece’s worth back into hair as a leave in. 

Dried a little (~10%) by scrunching a micro fibre towel and added gel with praying hands. 

Put the micro fibre towel on until dry. I used a very loose plop that I don’t think actually does anything at this length but it did stop me touching it! Any tips would be very welcome! 

Slept on a eucalyptus fibre pillow (very smooth, not quite silk). Refreshed in the morning with watered down gel.

EDIT: It’s normally a 2B/C when it’s longer and tends to get curlier as it grows. Normal porosity (I think), fine but LOTS of it."
xxfitness,fg574oc,t1_fg4fn7w,1580519939.0,"Yep, this. When exercise stops being self-care and starts being something that you punish yourself or feel guilty for not doing, it's time to step back and reassess."
vegetarian,fdu2j2q,t1_fdlfdm0,1578726372.0,Fellow celiac. Hemp protein powder is our favourite.
vegetarian,fdu1ne1,t3_em1bxh,1578725918.0,"Type 1, vegetarian here! How do you find it? I have learned that I need to keep a very active lifestyle to eat the relatively high carb diet that vegetarianism requires. If I don't, beans, legumes and grains send my sugars up like crazy, it's as though the insulin doesn't seem to respond quickly enough. Adding coconut milk or other fats does help slow absorption, and I've had some luck with dual bolusing there (pump user). I'm not vegan. Mostly because milk is my number one hypo cure, as long as I catch it before \~3.4 mmol/L (\~60 mg/dL)."
EOOD,fdtr8au,t3_emskq0,1578720947.0,I think realising this is half the battle. Welcome back to running and Happy Birthday!
yoga,fdovpvh,t3_embkon,1578613959.0,"Yoga and lifting go together really well. We (husband and I) do it before lifting as our warm up. Definitely find that we are more mobile and stable as a result, much more so than with e.g. Agile 11. Conversely we do it post-cardio. Post-lifting I tend to foam roll. For pre/post exercise purposes we use Yoga with Adriene. Her 30-day challenge videos tend to target the whole body."
xxfitness,f3dnqjn,t3_dg16v4,1570841865.0,The guy on the floor at lululemon the other day attempted to sell me leggings based on the draw string - so that I can fit my glutes/quads and my waist. That same day I climbed to the top of a (small) mountain with my co-workers and was the first to the top by about 15 minutes.
Stronglifts5x5,f22gji8,t1_ernf5u3,1569888581.0,I’ve been thinking about doing this! I’ve stalled around 32.5. I can do 3 set of 5 at 35. Is it okay to move to 5/3/1 for 1 lift and continue with 5x5 for the others?
xxfitness,f22add1,t3_db2l9m,1569885235.0,"I know where you are coming from! I’m 5’9” btw. My muscle development has completely freaked me out at times. I’d been skinny-fat for a few years now and the changes to my body have been very quick and dramatic. I like the quads/booty gains but when my traps grew I was really uncomfortable. I was convinced that was excess fat when I was younger (I was a serious athlete and hated that I weighed more than my friends even though I was a smaller or equal size) and convincing myself otherwise is hard! My clothing size hasn’t really changed (although the fit has changed and it’s gone down in some places) but I’m still convinced I look ‘bulky’. I also have type 1 diabetes and when that goes wrong I get quite bloated which I feel shows more on my now more athletic build. There’s a lot of pressure on tall girls to be skinny ‘yoga types’, and a lot of the insta weightlifters are shorter, so it’s hard to buck the trend. Ultimately, I really enjoy weightlifting and the fact that it is making me rethink/tackle my body image is probably a good thing. I love *feeling* strong, now I’m trying to love *looking* strong."
WeightLossAdvice,f2261k0,t3_d5jn8y,1569882617.0,"Yes absolutely! I was very briefly (a couple of years) overweight a few years ago. Turned out I was seriously ill and once we dealt with that the weight fell off. Anyway, I happened to move countries around the same time the weight gain happened so a bunch of people only ever knew me as “fat”. I’d been a fairly serious athlete all my life and suddenly found my opinions on fitness or any suggestion that I enjoyed fitness completely disregarded. Eating poorly was almost expected of me. I wasn’t really included as “one of the girls”. It was a weird, horrible experience and I’m glad it’s over! I try to consider whether I’m like this normally and I try not to be. I think I do subconsciously judge someone when I find out that they don’t take care of themselves and are overweight. We all have our biases. Realising you have them, accepting them,  and challenging them is what matters."
StrongCurves,f1ow60v,t1_f1oj231,1569664693.0,Interesting. Thanks!
xxfitness,f1ouhzb,t1_f1oj4ne,1569663248.0,"I lift, and have gained 7kg in muscle. Back still got smaller boobs stayed the same-ish ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Be keen to hear what happens for you!"
xxfitness,f1oidfx,t3_daar1m,1569646754.0,Haha I wish! My back size went down but not my cup. 36DD -> 34F
StrongCurves,f1hcqf7,t1_f1drksh,1569490623.0,How did you go about managing SL and SS? Did you do them on alternate days?
xxfitness,f0i7n0u,t1_f0hmg3o,1568637402.0,What you said especially the 24/7 pool! Except add in equipment for tall/long limbed people. I’m 5’9” with a short body and grumble until I remember my husband is 6’2” with the wingspan of someone 6’8”!
xxfitness,exb7viz,t3_crcngj,1566125120.0,For lifting I focus on technique. Can I feel each muscle activating? I try to imagine myself having control over each individual muscle in my body. It works especially well for my leg muscles and glutes. I also find that meditation tricks work well too: acknowledge the thought but let it pass as though it isn't a part of you but a car/runner/turtle cruising past you at the bus stop.
xxfitness,exb32ef,t3_crrpr7,1566121752.0,"Went to a gym in South Korea for a few years. My Korean was good enough to get by but absolutely not fluent. I loved it! I could get in and out without anyone bothering me, and I was forced to practice my Korean if I did need help. Being a tall white chick I did stand out at classes and I didn't really enjoy that but solo workouts were great. France is far more diverse so I think it's probably less of an issue in that sense. In terms of not understanding the instructor, I wouldn't worry you catch on quickly and a lot of gym classes follow the same routine most days with minor alterations. If its a branded class like Zumba you can probably watch a few classes on youtube in French to get a feel for the vocab.  You can do this!!!"
ptsd,eucx00y,t3_cfmfjl,1563690253.0,Holy crap. This is exactly where I am today. Thank you.
