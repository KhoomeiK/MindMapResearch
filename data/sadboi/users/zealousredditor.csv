At least she can admit that she dosen't know what this is, just like she wants our parents to do. Empathy does not require you to have the same experience. Actually a similar experience (aka having a misunderstood mental illness) should enhance her empathy.

Sometimes I'm not in the mood of dealing with her problems, but never have I said something this demeaning to her. If I don't have the energy to say anything, I'll just let her rant, not cut her short. I don't understand Generalized anxiety. I don't.

Even the times I asked her about the amount of milk she would act as if I'm just being qUiRkY or something. Something like: *""OMG how much milk did I put in there""* in mock valley girl accent.
