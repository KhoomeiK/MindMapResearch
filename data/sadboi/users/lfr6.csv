insaneparents,feiz49z,t1_feixa8c,1579151322.0,"There are so many variables in each person's life, a turn in one corner can change your life completely. Your reality is being obligated by religion to be a good person despite you thinking that on the inside you aren't. What if you could be an even better person without being religious? I'm not saying I don't believe you, I honestly do, but you really don't know if you would be in prison or dead without it, nobody knows their ""what if"". What I'm saying is that human beings are good because that's what work for us to be a successful animal in planet earth, of course there are a lot of POS, but 99.99% of people are inherently good, if it wasn't like that we wouldn't be here anymore, if everybody were like Hitler, we would have killed each other by now, but here we are. In fact,  a lot of wars have been caused because of religious reasons, that was Osama Bin Laden's motivations, or take Christianity's dark ages, that's really something.

For me, I don't know if the so called after life is how it has been picture to me (I was born Catholic, now I'm a Pantheist), I want to make the most out of my time on earth, I think that's what is all about, making the most out of me and the people around me.

Don't blend, as simple as that, just don't worry about that, I know everybody says this but now that I'm turning 40 I'm finally understanding it, look for yourself, get to know yourself, what you like, what moves you, believe me, I'm finally getting there, I have a small shop that I'm really sick of it, have had it for 15 years and now I'm just keeping it because it feeds me, but it is the reason why I'm so anxious and spend with this awful feeling 90% of the time. But I'm getting to know myself and just started this project that gets me working even until 2am, but I'm delighted, for real. Right now I'm working on it while I was thinking what to answer you

I know what you mean about making people uncomfortable, I've been there and yeah, its sickening, but little by little I have found my people, I have 2 good friends, that's all I need, really don't care about society. I even feel uncomfortable around my family (mother, father and brothers) so I don't really look for them and just spend time with my wife and son.

Don't worry to much, for real, things do get better with time, just don't expect to thing change in a day, it doesn't work like that.
