JUSTNOMIL,fqvhb9h,t1_fqve2hr,1589677259.0,"Gentle reminder that this is a support sub... 

Comments got locked so I'm gonna edit this one to add this: 

This is awful advice... its kinda manipulative and pretty much the definition of gaslighting. I'm certain there are better ways for OP to communicate with her husband. She said her husband was on her side so its irrelevant anyways. There's a huge difference between being in denial and calling someone a liar. OPs husband sounds like he's in denial and having a hard time *accepting* the fact that his mother would say something like that... that doesn't mean he doesn't *believe* her and thinks she's a liar. 

OP give your husband time. You can't push someone into facing the fact that their family is awful... i mean you can push them, but its just going to make them resentful. In their mind, it somehow becomes your fault that their mother is trash bc you made them face that. Ive been there and I know it sucks, but its still their family and that's a hard thing for a lot of people to face. I'd continue to tread lightly and let him realize it on his own.  You don't sound like a confrontational woman anyways, but especially dealing with PPD, you need your husband to continue to be your rock. He's your partner, not your enemy and it seems like you know that, but everyone on this sub thinks otherwise. 

That being said, you don't have to put up with her shit until he realizes it on his own. Respectfully, you really can't afford to take anymore abuse from her. PPD is a bitch. You're not a failure but that sneaky PPD loves to make you think you are. You don't need anyone in your life thats gonna side with your PPD. It literally sounds like shes saying the things aloud that my PPD used to say quietly in my mind. So I understand why thats the worst thing she's ever said and ever could say really. If its possible, I'd go full no contact until you get better. There's a stigma around mental illness and she sounds like the type of person that would use that as ammo, so give her whatever other reason you want or better yet, no reason at all. I guarantee once you start to distance yourself from her, your husband will finally see what you've been saying. Good Luck, we're all (mostly) here for you."

He took the heat for me and we never discussed it (& thank God bc I felt so much shame). IDK why I was ashamed bc I wasnt raised in a homophobic household but I still I spent an unhealrhy amount of time wondering ""am I bi or just in denial""? 

I still can't answer that question and I'm 30 years old. It took me YEARS to be okay with the fact that I can't define my sexuality. They have words now like pansexual and demisexual but I still don't know how how to label myself. I just like who I like and that's okay with me... My inbox is always open!"

I would never avocate to anyone (but women *especially*) that they blindly trust their doctors without doing their own research first. You did the right thing. You have to weigh the costs and benefits too and decide for yourself what's best, but you can't let your fears override your rationale. 


So... My doctor stopped giving me my birth control bc I was becoming high risk. NGL, I konda felt like you & I didn't want to do that. I was like WTF am I gonna do. She replied very professionally so I'm paraphrasing here but... you use condoms. If ur partner refuses, that's a good sign that you probably shouldn't sleep with him.

I mean, it was an adjustment but condoms really aren't that bad. Actually we're having a lot of fun with them (trying new brands, all the flavors and colors, etc.) . I'm an anxious person too, but it feels great to let go of that responsibilty and let my BF take control.


Best of all, I haven't had one UTI or yeast infection since. I always thought I was sensitive to these things and accepted it as a way of life. Its been a massive relief physically and mentally for me personally. Its worth a try. & if your symptoms don't go away, that sucks, but you could probably get back on ur BC and ur doctor will try something else. Keep your chin up girl you'll figure this out."

I Asher about the possibility of a smear test or a pelvic exam and was shot down immediately. I’ve researched into all the symptoms I’ve been experiencing and the number one result is ovarian cancer.

I'm gonn be blunt here... I know it sucks when you feel like you arent being heard, but you're not listening either. 

I'm sure youve noticed that google will always show 3 or 4 common conditions and 1 or 2 catastrophic ones. There's a saying I've heard amongst people in medicine: ""When you hear hooves, think horses not zebras."" He's right to attempt to fix your problems with the easier solutions first... There are dozens, if not hundreds of reasons why you're experiencing these symptoms. But diagnosing isnt always as easy as a google search, so he decided to try nixing ur birth control BC IT IS the most common culprit and the easiest solution. 

If I were in that much pain, I'd be willing to try anything & if it were that easy, I'd be ecstatic. You trustgoogle and your jnowledge more than your doctor, you obviously want treatment, so why did you go in the first place? You think you've self diagnosed already, you just want him to confirm whether you're right or wrong (which is ironic bc he doesn't know what he's doing). Doctors dont test everyone that thinks they have cancer bc they googled their symptoms. Its a waste of their time (especially during a pandemic) AND YOURS. Birth control PREVENTS certin cancers, including Ovarian Cancer. If you're 20 YO with no history of Ovarian Cancer and you're on birth control, you'd be close to zebra territory but he would get there after eliminating the things that make the most sense. 

Be a better advocate for yourself and your hoohah and trust that your doctor probably knows something you don't. I once went to the ER with leg pain so severe I felt like I couldn't walk. I was pretty pissed too when their first decision was to give me a chest xray but i guess they knew what they were doing bc I had walking pnuemonia. Walking pnuemonia is asymptomatic sometimes so my body was literallll screaming at me that something was wrong. Also, please don't waste their precious time and demand whatever test you think you need. Writing a post hating on doctors is also so incredibly tone deaf rn."

TwoXChromosomes,flug13i,t1_flue5j4,1585501866.0,"Obv bc of the opiate crisis, a lot of doctors have gotten pretty strict about giving out pain medication. But that probably means they've gotten a lot better at judging if someones an addict or if someone is literally just seeking drugs. There's a big difference though. Anyone who's ever gone to the ER for kidney stones is quite literally seeking drugs, but that doesn't mean they're an addict. I wouldn't worry about the side eye though. Regardless of what they think about you, even if you were an addict, doctors ethically have to treat you if you're in obvious pain. Funnily enough, in legitimate pain, you won't get ""high"" - the painkiller will just do what its supposed to do so it really doesn't matter lol."

LITERALLY NO SUCH THING YOU FUCKING FUCKTARD!!!

My girl, you're dating a classic narcissist:

1. Doesn't wear a condom but its okay bc its not his responsibility. (Narcs will never admit anything is their fault and will do gymnastics to make it yours instead. Every time.)
2. Instead, assumes YOU fucked up YOUR birth control AND THEN you had the audacity to lie to him about it?
3. Consults Dr. Google to verify his suspicions (Stop and ask yourself, who would do that, let alone think that about their partner? Someone who's a narcissist).
4. Proceeds to lie about his BLOOD DOCTOR ""friend"" in an effort to ""call your bluff"" all while subtly making him look superior / smarter / better bc you don't have doctor friends. 
5. He does all this so he can gaslight you and blame shift. ""Its all your fault that I knocked you up and I know you're lying about it to me. I'm so hurt and devastated by this that I need to go process this by myself. Fuck you and deal with the abortion by yourself bc you're a liar. Oops I fucked someone else to cope... well its kind of all your fault. Sorry OP, one day, when I'm ready,  I'll reach out again, but I'm not ready to yet. 

I just dated a man just like this. Mine cheated on me when I was incarcerated. It was my fault that I made the decisions that led to my arrest when I know how high his sex drive is... but he was the one that called the cops on me for a ""domestic""... after he headbutted me bc I confronted him about finding said girls phone # in his pocket. See they start off so charming and perfect and its so subtle but usually ends with something THIS ridiculous bc you say... wait how is this time my fault too? No. 

They do shit like this specifically to keep you on the hook & constantly apologizing for the shit THEY did. Since being with him, you might have lost a lot of confidence in yourself but think he's a 10/10. This is by design too and BS too. You just need to get TF away from him, like yesterday, so you can see all of it... just like you'd need to step back to look at anything that massive. It took years for me to finally see it and another year or so to fully understand the depths of it. When you look back in a year or so, you'll probably see that he went through this exact pattern SO MANY TIMES but this last time, he got cocky and it was too ridiculous for you to think it was your fault. 

Run fast and far girl. Maybe browse some narc subs here bc he sounds spot on. Things can only go up from here I promise you ❤"
TwoXChromosomes,flu7pwt,t1_fltud16,1585497027.0,"No idea what you mean by ""bad time for some"" but what about later"" but to answer your question yes and no. Risk isn't exclusive to just abortions. Ever heard someone say ""Back surgery can make your back 20X worse"" or ""you can go under anesthesia and never wake up""...? Abortions aren't even done with anesthesia - you're either sedated or under twilight at most. It's a relatively simple & safe outpatient procedure as long as you live in a place that they're accessible.

But yes, all risks increase the more you do something. But as long as you're not using abortions as birth control, I think you're probably gonna be fine. That was probably truer 100 years ago, but if you've heard that in your lifetime & you live in a 1st world country, then it probably came from someone with an agenda. Most ppl use this as a scare tactic to try to dissuade women from having them done &/or having them done too often."
TwoXChromosomes,flu5hes,t1_flttbei,1585495652.0,"An abortion isn't supposed to be like that girl! I'm sorry you had such an awful experience, which was probably made 10X worse by the fact that you weren't heard. That makes my blood boil...  If you haven't already, I'd follow up with a DIFFERENT doc to make sure you don't have an underlying condition that could explain that & also make sure there wasn't any damage done during the procedure... 🙁

My first pregnancy, I found out I was RH-. So basically my body tries to attack the fetus like it would do to a virus. Its NBD usually, but another condition compounded it & made it too risky so I had to have an abortion. It was pretty painless bc of the drugs they gave me. However, tryinf to go through labor without drugs was like... vomitting literally every time I had a contraction. I figured ""yeah labors supposed to be painful"" but apparently not that painful bc it was a major red flag for my doctors & I had to have an emergency C-Section. I know everyones different, but if your abortion was as painful as your labor, it really should've been a red flag for your doctors too..."

I was thinking, ""Well some women can actually orgasm from nipple play"". But that's actually kind of a weak argument, bc even if I had the science to explain it, plenty of people feel the same about feet. But if you sexualize feet, its a ""fetish"" & if you sexualize breasts you're pretty normal.

You REALLY might be onto something with that explanation there. Look at the ass and thick women culture shift (for lack of a better term). Men are proudly declaring their love for thick women, but 10 years ago they weren't. If they were into that and proud of it, they'd be called ""chubby chasers"" and shamed. They had a ""fat fetish"". I've been noticing myself being more attracted to ass or thick women but I never thought it was bc I was being exposed to it so much. That's crazy."
AmItheAsshole,flta2w9,t1_flt727p,1585464421.0,"IDK the answer to that question, but as a bisexual woman, I wonder about this too. I can't explain why breasts are so attractive. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally against the oversexualizing breasts and I'm all for not wearing a bra & breastfeeding in public. I breastfed for ~2 yrs, so I understand how annoying the sideye is. However, during the actual act of sex, I love breasts. I do and I can't explain why. People that like to say, ""Breasts are a sign of fertility / its biological"" excuse can't explain why either. 
Regardless of the ""why"", you can be sexually attracted to breasts without *over*sexualizing them."

Ive been in a similar albeit different situation. My ex-husband made me feel sooo invisible although like literally, not sexually... He wouldn't even look up from his phone when I'd try to talk to him. He'd come home from work and pass right by me like I was a piece of a furniture, I wouldn't even get a glance. Whenever he paid me any attention, it was only BC he'd want to have sex. By then I'd be so starved for attention and affection I'd take whatever I could get, even if it made me feel used / dirty. In hindsight, I'm pretty sure he had some mental health issues that he needed to address (which makes me feel guilty) but I dont regret leaving.

My current partner is wonderful but of course we have our own set of issues. The difference is, we both put in effort to make changes and be better and those changes generally last. All relationships are work after the honeymoon phase ends, but if one person has that wall up or refuses to change or doesn't care, well... don't be afraid to leave bc being single isn't nearly as painful as that.

But whenever its work or food related, it's always ""Chef... may I pleae have..."" etc. The Chef is always intimidating is, as is a lawyer or a doctor or professor. Its because they earned the right to that title. Personally, I've never met a Chef (or any professional for the matter) prefer to be called only by their first name. Not once. And I've never even heard of someone being so insistent about it. I could never call someone I respect by their first name like that - it would make me so uncomfortable. I'm not on their level and I dont want to pretend they're on mine. This whole thing is weird AF and I definitely think OP is just being stubborn and petty."

(For instances, leaving an unlocked Jaguar in a bad neighborhood, then waiting for it to be stolen so they can make an arrest). If you go to the police station on you own volition for them to ""test your drugs"" you've already committed the crime of purchasing and possessing drugs. The police had nothing to do with you buying or possessing drugs, and they certainly will test them but they'll arrest you afterwards. This is clever if you're a cop and stupid if you're a criminal - this isn't entrapment."

I called it out afterwords bc I felt that a straight guy telling us we've never been hated was more triggering than my limited lady dating pool. Sorry but straight people saying things like that is erasure. I think people like the guy in the OC have good intentions, but they don't realize that they're part of the problem. That way of thinking and sexualizing LGBT is progress, but it's still problematic and should be addressed. 

For clarity, heres my reply from this morninng: 


""I'm bisexual and have been told ""I'm not really bisexul"" or I dont belong in the LGBT... literally from the LGBT more than anyone else. It sucks and if they wanna be angry about everything I mentioned, okay cool that's their prerogative but I'm personally not very angry. Im also in the south and I experienced a lot of hate when I was dating a woman but now that I'm with a man, there's none. And I consider myself lucky that I can pass or don't typically ""don't look like a lesbian"". My point is, I've gotten crap from both sides but I'm also lucky in that I haven't had to experience that level of hate... if I had it would probably ruin me NGL. 

But I think you missed my point about the majority thing. While I do agree that maybe it seems that way now, not even 50 years ago, the vast majority of people did care (and arguably still do). We can't say they *NEVER* did because that just negates everything.

And I dont thinķ most people really change their views and opinions. You'd be surprised what people will say when they think they're in like-minded company. I've heard, ""I don't care who you sleep with as long as I don't see it."" Or ""I'm cool with it as long as you don't hit on me"" the most. That's not outwardly like murderous hate but it's still incredibly homophobic / trsnsphobic. It isn't even anywhere near accepting nor understanding."""

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but to say things like that and act like they know how I feel?

When you say that a majority of people don't care and never did, that's insane to me. The Gay Rights movement started 70 years ago. That's more than enough time for progress yet there has been next to none.... Sure Matthew Shepard was finally able to be laid to rest in 2018 after being murdered for being gay... but it took 20 years for his family to do so because they were afraid of vandalism. More big news in 2018: we could offically join the military and get married in some states. But that same year, 50 people died at Pulse Nightclub (which is now by far the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. History).

We take one step forward and two steps back. And the transgender community is even further behind. If you're a black transgendered women, you'll have to deal with the trifecta of hate: racism, sexism and transphobia. Last year, 26 transgender women were murdered (as a hate crime or as direct result of being trans) and the majority of them were black women. That's *reported* trans women that were murdered that they could prove was a hate crime. The actual numbers are probably insane but we won't know anytime soon. The acts of violence / hate crimes committed against the LGBT is literally countless and wildly unreported... because no one gives a shit like you said. 

I understand that the community sucks sometimes but this is why the LGBT community is so hostile and angry. And you saying ""we don't hate you and never have"" is literally denying everything we've been through. I understand that the LGBT community has changed. It happens whenever a group grows - reddit sucks more now than it used to but with more people joining, you're gonna get more assholes. I know reddit loves to say ""Trans people are assholes"" and ""you can be racist against white people too"" so I'll probably get downvoted to hell for this but fuck it. If you really want to be an ally, and it sounds like you genuinely are, dont say the majority of straight people are cool with it. Just be happy that those assholes felt comfortable to come out and join the LGBT community. They're still gonna be an asshole no matter where they go and if it doesn't effect you, why get so upset about it?"

As a woman, it's pretty shity when you feeling when you lose a friend because you rejected them. I lost a friend after we slept together too once. So if a guy befriends you *with the sole intention of sleeping with you*, he's not really your friend. Friends don't have agendas. 

If I'm being honest here, I befriended my current boyfriend because I was interested in him. Luckily he was interested in me as well, but we were both upfront about our feelings within the first week or so. We took things slow and did the ""friends first"" thing. I feel like most of us have probably been guilty of doing this at some point, so I don't want to sound like a hypocrite by saying this. I just think if you notice it's a recurring theme, maybe you should take a look at yourself honestly and ask why. It's totally normal and natural to *develop* feelings over time but it's kind of unfair to enter a friendship like that."

I wanted to reply to your  comment though bc I wanted to know if you've also been told you have a tilted uterus? I have a uterus that tilts forward (towards my belly not my back) and I've literally never had a tampon expand like in the commercials or the pictures that another user linked. I'm wondering if that's why for us and OP? 

I almost always leak and I can always sort of feel them. I make sure to put it in all the way and even try to angle it the right way too... so I'm wondering if it's a uterus placement problem more than a tampon placement problem. 

Honestly I'm kind of having an epiphany. I never realized it was supposed to expand fully and be comfortable / unnoticeable. I might just switch to the cup finally."

I think you just want to discuss abortion, which is the post topic so that's fair, but I think you just wanted to pick my comment apart more than anything.


Before I clarify, I just want to say, I shouldn't be a questionable Christian just because my beliefs differ from yours. Remember that little thing called ""the Reformation""? I suspect differing beliefs was probably a big reason why the church split. You're coming at me like we are 1,000 years in the past. And I'm glad you did because it proves my original point and shows that there's even a misconception about Christian's amongst themselves. Anyways:

1.) I never claimed to be a member of a Catholic Church... most people aren't usually Protestant AND Catholic. I am currently a member of an Episcopalian congregation; however, I know a little about Catholicism as I was baptized Catholic. I really didn't think it was necessary to elaborate because I've never had to prove that I'm a Christian on reddit I suppose lol. 

2.) Of course I don't know everything about the Catholic Church, bc I haven't been to one since I was a child. Nor have I recited or read the 10 commandments since I was a child. (And BTW, you're either arguing semantics or missing the point that the first commandment is about ""worshiping"" / loving ONE GOD.) I didn't get anything wrong, youre just splitting hairs and being *pretty hateful*. 

3.) Your explanation makes sense to me in that I can see how you connected those dots, but that's your denominations beliefs, not mine. I am studying for a major in Biology and I have different beliefs regarding abortion, bc of my education; however, I'm not gonna go there with you. Abortion has been debated for literally centuries and we still haven't gotten anywhere so I'm not gonna waste my time with it today.

4.) Again, my personal beliefs are completely separate from my religious beliefs and my area of study does effect them but not that much. I can be a scientist and a Christian. Maybe I can believe in evolution and believe that God evolved all these species to be perfect over time. Or I can believe that God gave us all our own personalities, thoughts, beliefs and even sometimes our doubts. (As a Catholic, that's a huge no-no, but IME my doubts have only brought me closer to God in the end, so it's been healthy for me to experience doubt). I can even LGBT and believe God made me that way... 

And finally, 5.) I can believe all this and still be considered a Christian because we don't live in the year 1000 anymore. I'm glad I don't have to worry that I may be actually murdered (unlike say a zygote). People all over the world are undergoing religious persecution and we should pray for them, not stir the pot."

I've literally never heard of our ""God Given Rights"" being ""Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness"" anywhere but the United States... and abortions happen all over the world. 

Pro-Lifers just believe life begins at conception, and you're taking away something's right to choose for themselves before they even have the chance to decided. So if they grow up and they want to commit suicide... at least they had the option to choose. Make sense? Pro-Choicers kind of think, great now two lives are ruined when one could have been saved.

confessions,fijcn2f,t1_fij3in5,1582442192.0,"Honestly, I respectfully disagree. I double checked snd the Bible does actually mention abortion. I had to double check because it's not usually a hot topic at church...  the majority of Christians (myself included) don't bring their political beliefs into church on Sunday. They practice the basics of being good to one another and do their best to follow the 10 commandents. I have no idea who in my congregation is a Republican or who is a Democrat, who is rich and who poor... because it doesn't matter. I am both LGBT, Pro-Choice and Episcopalian / Catholic. Controversial? Maybe but not to the majority.

The extremists use their own interpretation of the Bible to either justify their hate and push political agendas or play with snakes and speak in tongues. Most Christians find these groups abhorrent / weird. In the media, religious extremists that happen to be Christian get a lot more attention than the ""love thy neighbor"" Christians. Surely we've all heard of the Pentacostal Church or the Westboro (God Hates F*gs"") ""Church"". The majority of Muslims aren't terrorists either but thats not interesting enough to be news. 

Hate completely and literally the opposite of what it means to be a  Christian. In the 10 commandments, right after ""Worship One God"" is the Second Commandent: ""Love Your Neighbor as Yourself"". Hate and Christianity cannot coexist. 


ETA: I have no problem with the Right just because my views differ from theirs. I think the whole Democrat vs. Republican thing is weird and could honestly care less. But this is an interesting article I found that elaborates a little more on these groups.

But mostly, as I said in a another comment, we have very strong, outgoing personalities. We listen twice as much as we talk, but we talk ALOT. That can make it feel like there's a connection on your side of the bar, but if we feel it on ours, we will definitely lyk and usually ask for your number.

It gets awkward when you do as you say and throw the number away but... the guy is still a regular and keeps coming back. It's super awkward then... you can say you never got it and buy yourself a few more days. But ONE TIME - and EVERY TIME - these guys will get some liquid courage and confront you about it. Which makes you TA and everyone feel awkware and awful. 

I never lead on anyone for tips. IDC if the guy left me $100. If I ever suspected I was giving them the wrong impression, I'd explain that, ""I'm at work. This is my job. This is unprofessional. Don't do this to your bartenders please."" But if you're chill enough and have enough practice (and nip it in the bud early enough) you can keep your regulars and they usually understand. Saves everyone a lot of trouble. I'd almost rather someone ask me so we can have that conversation there and then without all that awkwardness.

Maybe the bartender in the OC hasn't mastered that yet, but even if she has, it gets annoying to have that conversation so frequently bc it *should be* common sense. Most of the good ones don't act like strippers and lead people on. That's how you get a stalker and 20 regulars all fighting for your attention and affection and it sucks. It sounds like a great suggestion but this is why it's really not a good solution."

Thank you for saying this! We aren't trying to lead you on. We are trying to do out damn job... It's innaproproate AF to ask a server or bartender for her number or leave her yours like OP did. & if I had a regular cross the line, I had no problem making this very clear... I didn't care about losing a regular bc 9 times outta 10, they were either poor tippers or got so drunk they forgot to pay their bill. ""Its cool, I know the bartender I'll get her back next week"". Yeah... no. 

& we are usually VERY outgoing people... we will ask if we want yours. Men and women both. Over ten years or bartending / serving, I've given my number to dozens of people but idr ever giving it to anyone that asked or responding to anyone that left me theirs. OP you done really fucked up."
AmItheAsshole,fi4sbzx,t1_fi46hwx,1582147463.0,">Maybe I'm going to deep with this, but I agree that it definitely started earlier than a year after OP and her ex split.

If this guy was a true narcissist, I would say you're just scratching the surface. I dated one almost 3 years ago and I still have moments of clarity like this."

confessions,fi1a3ud,t1_fi17qi2,1582053654.0,"Im not talking about Catholicism either. Again, I am a Christian, I was just baptized Catholic. Episcopalian is not Catholic. It's a form of practicing Christianity that's close to Catholicism but it isnt (hence the diet catholic joke). 

Jesus died for us on the cross to save us all because before that, Jewish people had to constantly ask for forgiveness and even then, true salvation wasn't a guaranteed thing. Christians get baptized and are absolved for past and future sins. That's the whole appeal of Christianity... that and what you said, as long as you repent and mean it, you can go to the Kingdom of Heaven and spread your afterlife there. However you must be baptized. Even small children, the most innocent can't go to Heaven if they aren't baptized. Babies aren't sinful and they cant ask for forgiveness either... So to me, it sounds like what you're telling me aligns more with Judaism / Old Testament Bible (aka before Jesus). My ex was Jewish, like dual citizenship in Israel, fluent in Hebrew Jewish, so I know a little about it, but not a lot of course so I could be wrong. 

So I'm just genuinely asking were you raised Methodist, Baptist, etc.? I'm just wondering what form of Christianity would teach that because that kinda defeats the purpose of Christianity rising if you believe that. I've literally never heard this being a Christian thing so I'm just asking, I'm not challenging you."
confessions,fi0t5qr,t1_fi0ijg5,1582044257.0,"I've heard of people ""losing their way"", but never losing their salvation. ""One baptism for the forgiveness of sin"" is generally the motto. I tend to lean towards ""Diet Catholic"" so maybe that's why I think this way. I was baptized Catholic, attended a Lutheran school and now consider myself Episcopalian

I mean, we all use the same book, but I'm aware that the way it gets interpreted can vary greatly.ook at the insanity of Westboro (the ""God hates f**s"" church - screw them). However, losing your salvation kinda defeats the purpose of Jesus dying on the cross doesn't it? It kinda goes against everything. Genuinely wondering if you could elaborate bc I'm confused AF now."
AmItheAsshole,fi0org2,t1_fi0npw6,1582041672.0,"Keep your essay. Its reddit. I'm allowed to comment on other peoples comments but I won't tolerate some fool (who can't even spell properly) criticizing medical professionals and downplaying all their hard work and effort. It is personal to me and does have something to do with me. So the next time you wanna have a private conversation in a comment chain, expect others to respond. Btw, you can simply message people instead if you wanna have a private conversation. 

>I stated several tines I meant no disrespect, and even admitted I admire and respect all medical students, and doctors

Then compared him to Joe Dirt.... but this is the dumbest thing I've heard all day, probably all week. It's literally like saying ""No offense but you're kind of a cunt"". Then you're shocked when they are offended. ""Well, I said *no offense* so..."" IDK of you're in middle school still or if you're just a foolish, ignorant sad human being. But either way, someone needed to call you out."

AskReddit,fhr1msx,t1_fhr0sqn,1581815260.0,"I had an epidural, which is a shot that goes into your spine. Interestingly, it doesn't actually numb you from the waist down like most people think. It just blocks the ""pain signal"" from reaching your brain for a little while (which I didnt know until recently honestly lol). A lot of women start having pain when the epidural wears off and that's why they give pain medication. I was in 0 pain during my csection but I was not on narcotics either... just the nerve blocking epidural. IDR being in a ton of pain afterwards either. So either ""it was worth it"" or it wasn't that unbearable and I was just really sore. Which can probably be said for women that had vaginal births. The hard part is over by then anyways you know?"
AskReddit,fhr0wez,t1_fhqzrdn,1581814761.0,I guess it's so you can be conscious when you do finally give birth (via csection). Hear and see your baby immediately etc.
AskReddit,fhqyq4j,t1_fhis7wr,1581813692.0,"Have you ever had a kidney stone or a uti? Where you can literally feel your bladder or kidney in pain? ""*Feeling*"" anything on the inside is really weird and never fun. Always concerning."
AskReddit,fhqy4ff,t1_fhinhao,1581813492.0,"See since I had wanted ""a natural birth"" I just got the epidermal but refused pain meds. So unfortunately I remember everything bc I'm a dumbass. Yeah... it wasn't fun especially since the csection wasn't planned and I was literally alone except for my Doula & tbh that was the scariest thing really. But after I heard my son cry, and saw him and they put him on my chest... I don't remember much after that bc I was so focused on him. Everyone always says how worth it it is and you forget about the pain immediately. I think there's probably some scientific / hormonal reason behind it bc the whole thing felt like a dream. I heard that's common for women too. So silver linings?"
AmItheAsshole,fhocfz1,t1_fho7vly,1581749882.0,"I have no idea how any of this works... but I do know it's not just elderly that think about their wills - I had a living will drafted 8 years ago when I had my son. However, when I get old and cranky and petty, I HOPE someone out there did me dirty so I can leave them a dollar or a rug or something."
AskReddit,fhik026,t1_fhh6y6s,1581626247.0,"My C-Section was also unplanned and an emergency. I was way underprepared bc I had originally planned a natural birth. Im not very granola but I wanted to prove to myself and everyone else that I could handle it and do it. (HAHA). Labor was going very poorly. So bad that it became an emergency for my son and myself and I understood that. So they doped me up, gave me a shot (that I welcomed) and within maybe 7 minutes, they were prepping me for surgery.

I remember asking my Doula, ""Why do I feel like I'm on a roller coaster right now?"" And he said he would tell me later... that feeling where your stomach drops on a ride, yeah that's bc they were rummaging through my insides to get to my uterus. I compare it to getting dental work done. You can *feel everything* except pain. Pressure, movement, etc. I was bawling my eyes out. Horrifying isn't even the word. 

But my son is a perfectly healthy 8 year old and I couldn't be happier. I haven't had another child and don't plan on it but yeah... its definitely not always magical for every woman. I would never look and never advise anyone else to look but morbid curiosity gets the best of us sometimes."

AmItheAsshole,fhgim98,t1_fhgc3mt,1581568138.0,"If OP wants to live off $40,000/year, she can technically make it the next 100 years lol. But if OP ever wants to buy a home or raise children, 40k/year probably won't cut it without additional income. Whether that comes from a future job or a future husband, IDK but somehow I don't see the BF being a good egg here. I'd trade in the BF for a new one and I wouldn't tell anyone else about the money. 

(Edit: IMO, whether you are well off or have terrible credit, finances that are *this extreme* should definitely be discussed before marriage; however, it's not something a BF or GF needs to know. You can say you're comfortable (or your financial situation is ""pretty bad"") but actual numbers should ABSOLUTELY be discussed before marriage.)"
