I don't recommend that you try glancing at the end-game math (multivariable calculus and differential equations) right now as a gauge. That shit is daunting as hell, and this is coming from a math nerd. Look at the class that you would need next, and consider whether or not you are ok with the idea of trying to learn it if you had a decent professor. And a good professor goes a long way - after going to a friend's diffeq class following the first midterm, I went from an F to a C. Not great for the GPA, but I passed, and even got an A on an exam. And I couldn't even make it to every lecture because of schedule conflicts with a meteorology class.

I also have ADHD. I have and have had multiple coworkers with ADHD. It certainly didn't make getting the degree easier, but it's not impossible. I wasn't even diagnosed in undergrad, I just had a very good friend for a roommate who kept me on task.

SuicideWatch,fkfdlwx,t3_fhzr9a,1584132088.0,"If you can, you should find a therapist now. The sooner you start dealing with the trauma, the better the outcomes tend to be, PTSD-wise. And dealing with trauma isn't linear - a lot of really awful depths of despair rotting in the hell that these memories are for you days can be followed by a nearly normal one, or even a great one. And there could be days where you'd been thinking it was behind you only to have it not be. Those blow, but they get fewer and farther between. It is completely understandable that you are overwhelmed right now. Even the strongest person, mentally, would struggle. And you were already in such a vulnerable place given your own struggles. 

I'm honestly impressed, both with how bravely and through great difficulty helped your friend, and that you are holding together enough not just to keep taking that next breath but to teach out for help. It's not just ok to not be ok right now, it's understandable or even expected. And it must be so very difficult to have friends who insist on not talking about it. I'd imagine many of them are struggling with their own emotions and just know how to deal with them, let alone help you deal with yours. I know that doesn't do much for you now, but hopefully they are good friends and kind people, and will be there for you when they can be.

If you can, I'd recommend finding a support group. For trauma or for loved ones of people who have died by suicide or nearly so. And maybe for those recovering from addiction or self-harm. A group of people who have been where you are, if not exactly, enough to understand and know the feelings you're feeling right now, and have felt them too. I've personally found some measure of peace in finding others with similar struggles to me, it helps me to remember that it's ok to be a bit of a mess and that I'm not the only one in the world who is dealing - it makes the world a little less lonely sometimes. Even if the people haven't been through your exact situation, they may be of some help and solace to you. I can't guarantee that will work for you the same as for me, but you clearly need someone who can at least hear your burden so that you can lighten it somewhat.

Flyers,fkedwpr,t1_fke1k3r,1584111139.0,"It depends, honestly, on how risky it would be to catch the virus itself. If I knew I tended to tolerate vaccines well but had chronic health conditions that meant the disease could kill me or significantly incapacitate me, I'd probably consider it, depending on who it was that developed the vaccine and the outcome of any trials that were previously performed.

In other words, I suppose I might let you know just how willing I am if it becomes available in a short time frame. I could see me doing it, if I thought my risk of catching the virus was high (so far it's seemed ok here, but people aren't going to let a little pandemic keep them from their tropical vacations, it seems, so it's only a matter of time) and hadn't already caught it.

If you can, try to find a way to strap your coat to your backpack for inside (to free your hands). And speaking of your hands - a warm but thin glove under one of those glitten things (the glove/mitten where the top of the mitten part can be slid off) was a lifesaver for me and my stupidly cold hands (I have startled my husband with how cold my hands are since moving to the Caribbean lmao). If the mitten part is being stubborn, get your SO to help make sure it's on as far as possible - it is easier to get it to stay if someone else adjusts it. And if it's still too cold, little handwarmers in your pockets are pretty great. Granted, it didn't generally get as cold in NS as it does in QC, but it was manageable when it did. Also, make sure your hands are already warm when you put gloves on - otherwise they don't work too well. Some mornings, I had to run my hands under hot water, dry them, then put my gloves on.

Wool is your friend. I wear wool socks almost exclusively. Yes, I wear them nearly every day in 80+ degree weather. Initially it was just for field work, where I need closed shoes for climbing random hills in cow pastures in the mountains, and otherwise I'd wear sandles, but it's comfortable and I don't get soggy feet if it happens to rain, which... tropics lol. They're not the thickest socks I own, mind you, but they're thicker than my cutesy thin socks with decorations on them. They will also be the socks I bring with me if I have to go to the consulate in Montreal (immigration is a pain) in winter. Also, wear shoes you are comfortable with. You do not want to be breaking in new shoes, and you do not want to be wearing synthetic fibers while having sweaty feet. Just trust me on that.

Instead of hats, which I hated wearing if I was going in and out of places, I usually wore scarves. Honestly, I usually used thicker decorative scarves or jersey material scarves (stretchy and stay in place, but not thick - bought them from hijab stores online), and wrapped them around my head. Then I could slide it to loosely hang around my neck inside. I still occasionally wear some of my scarves, including the jersey ones, down here. It's a little overly warm if I'm working outside, but not bad if I'm not doing physical activity. If it gets to be too much you can just slide it closer to your shoulders and let it hang open instead of it being wrapped around. Back in Canada, this is how I did trips to the mall and such once I had a couple winters under my belt. I also had a thick wool scarf if I was just going house to car to office and wasn't going to be shoveling enough to generate much body heat.

Also, don't forget your sunglasses. You probably don't need to be told this, but you don't want to be so wrapped up in gathering the stuff you're not used to needing that you forget them.

And don't be afraid to just go ""I need to step outside/inside"" if it gets to be too much. Even if you're in the middle of something. Neurotypicals do that too. I'd also recommend not overdoing it on warm clothes. If you're out doing physical activities, you will warm up, even if it is -20 to start."

AspiePartners,fe5r49d,t3_entug5,1578873373.0,"Warning: long rambling reply from a sleep-deprived aspie ahead. Tldr: get both of you to therapy, she needs healthy coping mechanisms and you need to cope with the fallout of an unhealthy situation.

She needs help, probably a lot of it, and it's not help you should be required to give, and it may not even be possible for you to come close.

I'm really, really sorry, but you're going to have a lot of difficult decisions in the near future. You are not obligated to be her punching bag, not even metaphorically, and what she is doing is abusive - whether or not she realizes it is and even if those feelings are very, very real in the moment. A lot of it sounds like how I feel when I start to burn out. It suuuuuuuuuuucccckkkksssss. But, that doesn't mean I get to take it out on my husband, just as your partner doesn't get to take it out on you. And while I don't always recognize that's what I'm doing, and I might get big mad when he enforces his boundaries, it's better in the end. I know you are trying to help and probably feel pretty darn helpless yourself, but she needs to find healthy coping mechanisms before irreparable damage is done.

If it is accessible/affordable, mental health treatment is probably a good start. I'm assuming Canada based on the power plant thing, but I know that mental health accessibility in a timely fashion can be... hit or miss... depending on province. I recommend looking into it and talking to your or her doctor about it at least, and they should be able to give you a better idea for your community. You should consider some for yourself as well - it is not easy to be in your position, and you cannot help her if you cannot help yourself. Yes, you can try, but that shit will catch up to you. 

If you trust local emergency services, I would suggest that you call them the next time she threatens to kill herself. She probably does actually have more than a little suicidality going on, not just as an emotional weapon. It's alluring when everything is overwhelming and out of control - finally it can all shut up and there can be peace because dead people don't have to deal with this crap. Autistic people do have a lower life expectancy, in no small part due to suicide.  If you do go that route, and call for help, you will need to be prepared that she may try to stop you, and she may hate you for it. But if she caves to that impulse... Well, no one ends up happy.

Beyond that... Honestly, I found interacting with other neurodivergent people to be some of the best help outside of therapy and medical interventions. We can swap tips and tricks and not feel like the crazy one in the group. Putting those tools and other various accomodations into practice makes things... Well, not perfect... But better. I don't know what will make life more liveable for your partner... That's going to take a lot of trial and error, and I don't know her well enough to know where to start. Clearly, though, y'all's situation is untenable as it is. And you should not - and cannot, really - set yourself on fire to keep others warm. Even if you love them and really care for them.

Caveats: I'm on mobile so I can't read your text while replying, and I'm sure I missed some stuff, so I'm sorry if I've missed anything or am not being terribly helpful. Also I might be a bit scatterbrained at the moment, so if you need anything clarified, I'll do my best. Furthermore, we're all different and I could be way off the mark. And, I'm giving your partner the benefit of the doubt that she really isn't in control anymore and that she'd be willing to do what she needs to do to take control, even if she doesn't know where to start and doesn't think it's possible right now. If it's something like burnout, she could need to remove whatever it is that is stressing her beyond her tolerance and rest/recover before she can work on building healthy habits. I don't know, maybe she's just a manipulative jerk, but I hope not. And if she isn't willing to work towards making your relationship healthy, you need to look towards your own health. Build up your support network, you're going to need it no matter how this goes.

My first job was through a temp agency, working in a call center. I applied to about a trillion different jobs, and that's the one I got. The call center actually wasn't so bad, since it was all scripted, and as we were working in pharmaceuticals, there was no going off script.

My first job actually in my field was a bit more unique in how I got it. My husband emailed a local company to ask about what my job prospects would be once I had proper immigration status, one thing led to another and I had a job like 4 months later. But I work in a super tiny field, that is even tinier in the country we lived in at the time. And it still required essentially being adopted by someone with more social skills (though the boss was way less interested in that, in the end, than the fact that my husband worked for local government, so I was probably in the area to stay).

My current job is with a government agency. I applied for a lot of positions, including entry level ones. Being disabled actually opened up some more options for me (if you are in the US, look into Schedule A hiring if you can). After about 15 months of applying, interviewing (over the phone), and being turned down, I was selected. 

Honestly, once you find that first job, it does get easier if you can stick with it - which I know is easier said than done. I'm now on generally equal footing with people who have higher degrees (I'm a grad school dropout), because I have experience, in a field where those higher degrees are usually seen as a necessity. I've definitely simplified things a bit to avoid this being a novella (admittedly not that successful on that front), and it hasn't exactly been easy the whole way through, but that's the general idea. And now I still need to figure out this networking thing so I can progress in my career, which... Well, we'll see how that goes lol..."

This doesn't mean you need to find a job that you always love. Maybe it means you find a job with hours that work for you, that you can tolerate, and pays well enough for you to do the things that matter to you. The tolerate and hours part is more important than you might think... I love the field I work in, but I haven't always loved what I was doing at/for work."

I never had to return anything though, so I can't really tell you about that process. I've also never been in their store, since I lived in Halifax lol.

Not to discourage you from ordering from abroad (I still did it regularly up there), but if you do, remember to factor in customs and brokerage fees, even if they're not guaranteed to be charged. Like I said, I still bought things from outside of the country quite frequently, but getting hit with import fees if you weren't expecting them sucks."

aspergirls,evfntvm,t3_cjmq3m,1564498565.0,"I was just shy of 16 when my mom was diagnosed with cancer. We were told not long after the diagnosis, but my mom tried to hide it during the diagnosis process. I say tried because no one ever paid any mind to how much I overhear things.

Mom got her mammogram. No big deal, she'd put it off for a couple years, so this was her first. Then my parents started trying to hide phone calls and doctor's appointments and a second mammogram and the biopsy. Extra letters and such started coming from the insurance company. As some background info, mom's dad had died of cancer when I was 10, and I knew her mom had had breast cancer when I was a child; dad's family had no shortage of cancer diagnoses either. So I knew enough for it to be scary. But I had no other info other than ""mom doesn't want us kids to know, so I'll just worry in silence, lest my sisters overhear anything, or anyone see what I'm searching on the family computer and get in trouble."" My poor mom was so proud of having protected us from having worried during the diagnostic process only to have me point out that I knew something was up because lol what's tact.

As for scary Google searches... Yeah they suck, and some of the shit can be downright terrifying for no reason. I was about your daughter's age when I had a lymphoma scare because my body is weird and a gland that was supposed to shrink didn't. I googled everything. It was awful. But it was better than what my imagination would have come up with. It's better than what my imagination had come up with in the past with my parents' health issues.

Honestly, you know her best... Maybe if you think she'd go off the deep end with searching info online, start by giving her a lot of reputable sources of info that don't have any scaremongering. Take her to an appointment and have her ask the doctor questions, assuming you know the doctor to be knowledgeable about the potential problem (the family doctor I saw after my er visit that led to the scare had no idea what was going on other than the radiology report saying to do a hematology consult... It's not reassuring to listen to a doctor call an oncologist for answers lol). But chances are you're not really saving her a lot of worry, you're just keeping the worry at ""something is wrong but I don't know what and this is scary"" instead of ""something could be wrong and that wrong thing would be that and that is scary"""
AskReddit,ev7yobz,t1_ev6zzct,1564266290.0,"Seconding the don't swerve, but with a side of hard lessons and hypocrisy.

A dog ran a few feet in front of me on the highway at like midnight in the middle of nowhere about a decade ago. Normally I drove sedans, but that night I was driving my then-boyfriend's Jeep...  I did nearly keep it on all four wheels, but nearly doesn't really get you anywhere, it turns out. Rolled at least 2.5 times, somehow around a curve. Thankfully it was a guy in a car who found us first and was able to stop before hitting us, and parked back far enough that the trucks would see him in time to stop. The good news is no one died, and the dog was ok, based on the fact that the guys in the ambulance saw it as they turned around to get to us.

I can't say I wouldn't do it all again because I just don't know. And I don't drive big vehicles anymore either, so the risk of doing road cartwheels is lower. But the concussion wasn't any fun (nor the glass stuck in my foot for weeks), and the PTSD hasn't exactly been a riot, so on the whole, really do not recommend."

Not entirely foolproof, and maybe a bit overkill in terms of taking on extra responsibility just to avoid other humans, but... 

(I'm partly kidding and partly being honest. We'd go feed the dog and disappear for hours lol)

Less drastic measures? Take breaks. Purposely lose games and hide somewhere like the washroom. Sassy messages under the table to your fiancee. Offer to help by taking the little ones to another room or outside to play once they're toddlers... And use that time to ""corrupt"" them with messages of tolerance lol.  

I use a fair number of these on my own family, tbh. We've only visited my in-laws once in nearly six years of marriage, so I don't have much experience on that side of things. Good luck."
AskTrollX,es9qvl9,t3_c6fuoi,1561742450.0,"I'm from the states and live in Canada. I have never gone home for Christmas. I've done a few Thanksgivings at home, because no one at my office (we're a small office with 24/7 coverage, so days off are competitive essentially) has any interest in having a week or two off at the end of November. Sometimes, though, even when I have time off, the money just isn't there for the trip.

While I do feel kinda bad about not going home for the holidays, and I'm kinda sad to have missed Christmas with my family for 6 years now, it's just the way things have to be. I only got Christmas off for the first time this past year, and only a few days - not enough, really, to justify going 1000 miles, even if I had the money. And my parents have yet to get a passport, let alone visit me, so... *shrug* I guess now I get to wait and see if they are more willing to do a portion of the traveling once I'm in the Caribbean instead of Canada, since I am supposed to be moving there in a month lol (still waiting on the last bits of paperwork from my new employer smh federal government is fun)."
