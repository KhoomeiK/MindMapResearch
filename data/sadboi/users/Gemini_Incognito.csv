## Address to a Haggis

Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,   
Great chieftain o the puddin'-race!  
Aboon them a' ye tak your place,  
Painch, tripe, or thairm:  
Weel are ye worthy o' a grace  
As lang's my arm. 

The groaning trencher there ye fill,  
Your hurdies like a distant hill,  
Your pin wad help to mend a mill  
In time o need,  
While thro your pores the dews distil  
Like amber bead. 

His knife see rustic Labour dight,  
An cut you up wi ready slight,  
Trenching your gushing entrails bright,  
Like onie ditch;  
And then, O what a glorious sight,  
Warm-reekin, rich!

Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive:  
Deil tak the hindmost, on they drive,  
Till a' their weel-swall'd kytes belyve  
Are bent like drums;  
The auld Guidman, maist like to rive,  
'Bethankit' hums.

Is there that owre his French ragout,  
Or olio that wad staw a sow,  
Or fricassee wad mak her spew  
Wi perfect scunner,  
Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view  
On sic a dinner?

Poor devil! see him owre his trash,  
As feckless as a wither'd rash,  
His spindle shank a guid whip-lash,  
His nieve a nit;  
Thro bloody flood or field to dash,  
O how unfit!

But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed,  
The trembling earth resounds his tread,  
Clap in his walie nieve a blade,  
He'll make it whissle;  
An legs an arms, an heads will sned,  
Like taps o thrissle.

Ye Pow'rs, wha mak mankind your care,  
And dish them out their bill o fare,  
Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware  
That jaups in luggies:  
But, if ye wish her gratefu prayer,  
Gie her a Haggis

&#x200B;

### Address to a Haggis Translation

Good luck to you         and your honest, plump face,  
Great chieftain of the sausage race!  
Above them all you take your place,  
Stomach, tripe, or intestines:  
Well are you worthy of a grace  
As long as my arm. 

The groaning trencher there you fill,  
Your buttocks like a distant hill,  
Your pin would help to mend a mill  
In time of need,  
While through your pores the dews distill  
Like amber bead.

His knife see rustic Labour wipe,  
And cut you up with ready slight,  
Trenching your gushing entrails bright,  
Like any ditch;  
And then, O what a glorious sight,  
Warm steaming, rich!

Then spoon for spoon, the stretch and strive:  
Devil take the hindmost, on they drive,  
Till all their well swollen bellies by-and-by  
Are bent like drums;  
Then old head of the table, most like to burst,   
'The grace!' hums.

Is there that over his French ragout,  
Or olio that would sicken a sow,  
Or fricassee would make her vomit  
With perfect disgust,  
Looks down with sneering, scornful view  
On such a dinner?

Poor devil! see him over his trash,  
As feeble as a withered rush,  
His thin legs a good whip-lash,  
His fist a nut;  
Through bloody flood or field to dash,  
O how unfit.

But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed,  
The trembling earth resounds his tread,  
Clap in his ample fist a blade,  
He'll make it whistle;  
And legs, and arms, and heads will cut off  
Like the heads of thistles.

You powers, who make mankind your care,  
And dish them out their bill of fare,  
Old Scotland wants no watery stuff,  
That splashes in small wooden dishes;  
But if you wish her grateful prayer,   
Give her \[Scotland\] a Haggis!"

HomeworkHelp,fgocfb5,t3_ezge92,1580965500.0,"Not Indian, this is just my best explanation from reading reference materials.

Endogamy and exogamy can exist at the same time because they're referring to two different types of group. 

gotra are exogamic, and jaati are endogamic. 

Jaati is like, a community.  There are thousands of them, and they're mostly defined by profession, although some are religion or language.  You're born into a jaati, and you marry people who belong to the same jaati.   (Endogamy!)

gotra is family, who you're descended from.  Most gotra are patrilineal, meaning you belong to the gotra of your father,  (Some cultures it's matrilineal, meaning you belong to the gotra of your mother.)  You're born into a gotra, and you cannot marry people who belong to the same gotra.  (Exogamy!)

Super simplified explanium:

Your father is an archaeologist.  You're automatically also an archaeologist.  You're expected to marry another archaeologist.

Your father is Henry Jones.  You're automatically also a Jones.  You're not allowed to marry any other Joneses. 

\----------------------

Interesting stuff:

Your father's brother's daughter is in the same gotra as you.  She's like a sister, you can't marry her. 

Your father's sister's daughter is in a different gotra.   You can marry her. 

American style family would class both of those women as your cousins, and you really shouldn't marry either of them."

So now we have r + 3r = 80 miles.  in other words, 4r=80.  So r = 20miles and 3r = 60miles.

and they took 4 hours to meet, so 20 miles/4hours is 5mph for the slower cyclist and 60miles/4hours is 15mph for the faster cyclist.

The pastor was pointing at the ushers, telling them to get the unity candle ready.  He was just doing it right next to the bride and groom while they were doing the first kiss. 

Not all that important, just funny that the wedding photographer happened to get those shots."

Most of the things you do with snake blood require 'fresh' blood, so it's hard to find anyone that sells it."

Oh yeah, it's all fine. 
The wedding photographer managed to capture the exact moment the maid of honor realized she didn't have the ring.
Also the expression on my mother in law's face when the butterflies turned out to be not entirely awake yet. 
And the  . . . interesting  . . . decision made by the pastor to make a big dramatic pointing gesture right next to the couple at the ""you may kiss the bride"" part."
