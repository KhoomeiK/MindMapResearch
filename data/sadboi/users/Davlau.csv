The scars can remind you of His love and His unwavering presence in your life. I would imagine He is proud of how far you have come.  I am sorry the scars cause you pain and upset you.  I hope as other people here have said, that they come to remind you of your strength to overcome hard times.

If you spoke to each child they would describe their father in different ways based upon how he had interacted with them.

It just means don't carry the weigh around in your heart- he is not worth that amount of energy.  

Aside from that, I am sorry that he hurt you so badly in high school.  I hope that any invisible wounds/bruises you carry from that are able to heal completely.  You may never see him face justice for his actions and that is frustrating.  It must also be tough to see people you like spending time with someone who hurt you.  Since it may not have happened to them it is easier for them to let it go and it is not a sign that they don't care about you or your feelings.

If you are not already going for counseling I would recommend it. I have two friends whose spouses were unfaithful and both of them are still married.  One couple thoroughly hashed through everything that happened and they were able to rebuild their marriage. They actually got new wedding rings and had a whole new renewal of their vows ceremony as a clear sign of starting over. The other couple did not go for counseling and I know that the wife still to this day does not fully trust the husband. She has chosen to be in a marriage that is less than fully joyful as she thinks that is better than being alone.   I am lifting your marriage up in prayer now and I really believe that it can be healed. I don’t know how long ago you found out but I urge you to be patient with yourself and to allow for a time of healing for yourself. You still have every right to be angry.  In fact you have every right to feel anyway that you genuinely feel. I have not been in your situation but I could see you not wanting to touch my husband knowing that someone else had.

Don’t listen to mean people.  Sit quietly in the presence of your heavenly father and let him fill you with his peace and a sense of how precious you are to him.

OpenChristian,fap77ph,t3_ea5lpi,1576281611.0,"I was a lifelong Catholic up until my mid-40s.  I even ran the religious education department at my church and oversaw all of teaching done in our parish. I had a great love of the Catholic Church. When I found out that my son was gay, my pastor told me that he thought my son was making a horrible choice and that I should know that my son was putting his eternal salvation at risk. My relationship with the Catholic Church ended that day. There is no room for disagreement in the Catholic Church. I saw in your edit that you say that you would not change your positions about homosexuality or abortion. You are not allowed to be a Catholic if you believe in those things. You would be excommunicated or at a minimum you would be denied communion. That happens to politicians in the news all the time if they come out saying that they do not agree with the church’s official positions. In reality, most of my Catholic friends do not believe in a large number of the Catholic Church teachings but they just don’t tell the priest.  That did not feel right for me. I don’t want to go to a church where I am implicitly pretending to agree with something that I don’t. I left and went to a nondenominational Christian church. I have since moved on from that to an Evangelical Lutheran Church of America parish. The services and the traditions remind me very much of the Catholic Church however this is the place where ALL of my children could get married.

I agree that it’s very important to allow Jesus to lead us to where he wants us to be so I am in no way trying to overrule the promptings of the Holy Spirit. I just want you to know that given your beliefs the Catholic church does not seem like a fit for you unless you’re willing to hide those beliefs from church leaders."

I have to believe that the majority of people who see what happened will immediately know that you were in the right and your boyfriend had acted inappropriately. Really, I agree the fact that you said you trusted him makes it clear that he had been unfaithful. That makes him look bad, not you. People who make mean comments like that often feel so bad about themselves.  The mean words are a reflection of them not you.

By the way, I’m so proud of you for loving yourself enough to not put up with his cheating. You deserve much better. Even if he tries to come back and say he won’t cheat again I would suggest being very very cautious as he has already proved his willing to be unfaithful.

People very quickly find something else to talk about so you focus on taking care of yourself. Do you things that you like to do and spend time with people that make you feel happy.

I think that everyone is invited to dive into scripture regardless of how knowledgeable they are about the Bible. I often tell people to start with the stories about Jesus and to get a sense of His actions and his words. I have a difficult time interacting with people who say they take every part of the Bible literally. The Bible starts with two different and seemingly incompatible stories of creation. Was man created before animals or after animals?   In the bigger scheme of things does that even matter? I know I started by reading the Bible looking for stories of God‘s love for us and how precious we are in his eyes. I have attended and lead Bible studies for many many years so I have come across people who use the Bible as a weapon or is it justification for actions that I flat out think are not Christian. God tells us to love him and to love each other.  I would suggest that you spend time in prayer asking God to give you good discernment about what you read in the Bible and then move forward and which ever way you feel him leading you.

I don’t know what kind of help you are getting for your anxiety but please don’t give up trying to find a solution. I had to start with medication on a daily basis.

I currently use Metro gel and Soolantra and it is working well.  My last dermatologist never even mentioned these topical treatments.  It may be worth seeing if a new doc would think of something you have not tried before.

Anxiety,f59npey,t3_dnca8m,1572092583.0,"Forgiving ourselves can sometimes be harder than forgiving other people.  Since you are realizing there have been times that you have wronged other people, make a commitment to act in a better way going forward and then forgive yourself.  If it would make you feel better (or the other person feel better) if you gave a brief apology then you could consider doing that.  Otherwise, it sounds like you are at a new place of awareness of your actions and are trying to be better.  That is great.  We have all, every single one of us, done/said things we regret.  We learn from our past but don't have to dwell on it.  How are you acting today is what matters now.  How you plan to act tomorrow is important, too.  Be gentle with yourself.  Not everybody gets to where you are and some people stay in the place where you used to be so be proud of yourself for reflecting on the kind of person you want to be."
Anxiety,f58j1v8,t3_dn6mte,1572057186.0,"I know it is hard to not dwell on those things and I do think it is important that we all care.  However, I have learned over the years that so many things I have focused on and worried about never came to be.  I am old enough that when I was young we had nuclear bomb raids and had to hide under our desks (like that would have helped!).  I felt so despondent at times thinking what was the point of even hoping for the future when the Russians were going to bomb us any time now.  There are lots of other examples but I have learned that somehow the world keeps going on.  I try to make my little part of the world peaceful and happy.   I do what I can to make the wider world better when I see an opportunity.  Yes, the mean, hate-filled people get a lot of press, but they are not really the majority- just the loudest.  The world is full of good hearted people, too, and we need to find each other and lift each other up.  Look for good news stories and for good people around you.  If you only think about the bad people you give them more power."
Anxiety,f51bhwb,t3_dmifjj,1571939394.0,"I can relate to your comment as I had many years feeling that same way. Are you going for any help for your anxiety? I finally got so tired of my self-imposed isolation that I went for help and it made a big difference in my quality of life.

Is there someplace that you might want to volunteer, like an animal shelter?  There may be ways you can get out more in places that feel safe and not overwhelming."
Rosacea,f4ykhz0,t3_dlku85,1571878606.0,No purge.  It just took two weeks or so before I could really notice the difference so be patient.
Rosacea,f4wbogh,t3_dlku85,1571854089.0,Now I use them every other day. At first I used one in the morning and the second medication in the evening. My rosacea is so under control with this regiment that I alternate mornings now and are still able to maintain the smooth skin with using them one med one day and the other the next.   I have had rosacea a very long time and it has been trial and error for me. For a while taking an antibiotic was enough and then it just stopped working. This is working for me now but I won’t be surprised if in a few years this also stops working. It’s almost like the rosacea somehow becomes resistant to the treatment or something
Rosacea,f4s1ku2,t3_dlku85,1571773623.0,My dermatologist has me using the metro gel in the morning and Soolantra at night and it has cleared all of that up on my face.  I don't know how much of the improvement is due to the metro gel but I have had no side effects.  I would trust your dermatologists judgement but you could always ask about combining two meds like I do.
LifeProTips,f48z70d,t3_djwm1k,1571452991.0,"Well this might be good advice for some people, But it would not have been Good advice for my son. He came out to me when he was only 17. We accepted him with love and joy and full support.  He had been carrying such a burden of having a secret and if he had carried that burden until he was financially independent it would’ve broken my heart that he would have spent all those extra years of feeling like he had to hide some thing from us. I say that if a young person has any questions about how their parents might react or if they might be kicked out then this is prudent advice. I think kids sometimes know in their heart if their parents will be fully loving and accepting and if so, the sooner that those kids can start living their true identity and real self the better."
FreeCompliments,f48u2ej,t3_dju8bc,1571448911.0,Hello young man with such beautiful eyes and such a warm smile! It’s amazing that even in the middle of a struggle you can still look so friendly. There is of warmth to you that is undeniable. I hope the next few days and weeks are much much easier for you!
Anxiety,f48txrf,t3_djvsyn,1571448808.0,"Loud noises or blinking lights make everything much more difficult. Perhaps go outside and take a walk? Is there anyone you trust there because sometimes even just voicing how you are feeling can make a difference. Have an ice cold glass of water and focus on the cold sensation as you swallow it. Find the most quiet part of the room or the quietest room and spend some time there. Perhaps get into a conversation with someone so you get distracted from the anxiety and you don’t allow it to spiral even higher.

If your strategies don’t work, take a deep breath and feel free to leave. Congratulate yourself I’m even going there in the first place! You’re not obligated to stay places you’re not comfortable"

OpenChristian,ezqrmx4,t3_d1v631,1568063118.0,"It sounds like you and your wife have found a way to make your marriage work. Every marriage is completely unique and it can be very damaging to hold a marriage up to expectations set by a community, a society, or even a church. In my marriage, I handle all of the finances and I am the wife.  I’m just better at it than my husband is so our salaries go into our checking account and I take care of paying all the bills and figuring out refinancing the mortgage or whatever else needs to be done. I also handle a lot of the appointments for repairs or work to be done around the house. Many of my women friends don’t do these things in their marriages but I am happy to do them and I am good at it. I think my husband is honestly happy to not have to do it because it’s a burden for him. When we had our first son, I was Only able to take off 6 weeks.   My husband took off 16 Which is uncommon.  In no way do I consider him submissive.  He doesn’t take the lead on some things but in plenty of other ways he leads whether by great financial support, loving encouragement of the kids, organizing a vacation.   If you are happily married be grateful and enjoy.  Drop the expectations and be kind to yourself.  :)"

OpenChristian,ewmgvcv,t3_cp0uxt,1565551346.0,"Hello.  I agree with you not wanting to be part of something that disagrees with who you are and that doesn't celebrate you exactly the way God made you.  I left the Catholic church after my son came out as gay for the same reason. I now split my time between an ELCA Lutheran church that is fully affirming and welcoming, and a non-denominational Christian church.  I need my family to be someplace where all my kids, whether straight or gay, can be fully embraced and possibly married someday (if that is what they choose).  You are correct that God would never denounce you, He adores you and wants to lift you up and continually closer to Him.  I am sure He rejoices in your desire to find a church home and I will pray that you find the right church family for you.  Is there an ELCA church near you that you could visit?  My only advice is to pray for guidance and keep looking until you find a church that feels right for you.  A place that treats you like treasured family- because that is what you are."
MomForAMinute,ewjmkur,t3_cokx7r,1565468872.0,"I am so proud of you for being honest with yourself about messing up.  Everyone can do something regretful but not everyone has the character to admit it, even to themselves so great job on being honest.  I am sorry you are in this situation.  You may have lost someone's trust and respect and that hurts.  Luckily, this can usually be fixed over time.  I am happy you did not lose your job.  You have a chance to go back and do things differently going forward.  You may want to apologize to the person who is mad at you.  I am sad that they would talk about you behind your back instead of having the courage and character to approach you and talk things out.  You are clearly learning from this and I know you will make better choices going forward.  Do what you can to fix the damage, forgive yourself as mistakes are human and we all make them, and don't allow others to make you feel bad about yourself as I am sure they have messed up, too.  Good people sometimes do bad things.  Regretting those actions and wanting to do better is how you know that you ARE a good person.  Be kind to yourself and when you are eventually in the other person's shoes and someone around you messes up, pay it forward and give them a chance to make things right.  We can all lift each other up or knock each other down and you seem like a lifting up person.  I hope this blows over soon and you are able to move past it quickly.  Sending you a big hug."

Other people had told me to expect this so it did not ruffle me at all.
