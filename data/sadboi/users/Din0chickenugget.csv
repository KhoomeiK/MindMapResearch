There are other times where I say the wrong word completely (happens a lot with names and places), even though I’m thinking of/know what I mean. With writing I’ll also tend to write down homophones for even the most basic words (two when I mean to, weigh when I mean way...). Luckily I (usually) catch those before I, say, send that text or submit that assignment, but as a total grammar freak (or at least formally, now that I can’t fucking write) who is currently in school (for majors where I’m writing all the time) it’s incredibly frustrating and makes me feel like an absolute idiot. 

I’m also noticing that my hands are more shaky than normal, which is a bit frustrating when I try playing music or have to use any sort of fine motor skills but that’s much less severe."

Graduating with as little debt as possible will set you up nicely after college, especially if getting a job in your field right away is a concern (if that’s something you’re worried about, I can totally sympathize). I don’t know anything about this program but alabama is a hell of a lot cheaper than New York."
GeneticCounseling,fkyjhto,t1_fky13hg,1584649966.0,"Of course! I haven’t gotten a chance to do a deep dive for hotlines yet, but if you need something to do this summer, look into comfort zone camp (a camp for kids who have lost parents or siblings- I’ve been myself and it’s an amazing organization) and/or the Huntington’s Disease Youth Organization. Both take volunteers with no prior experience. 

I can’t speak firsthand for HDYO but if anyone wants info about CZC feel free to DM me. 

I’ll edit this comment later when I find the hotlines again. Or I’m sure you could reach out to those organization online and see if they have any suggestions"
GeneticCounseling,fkxyxcr,t3_flbqjk,1584638133.0,"Have you considered maybe finding a specific hotline or organization with a different focus? I used to go to a therapy camp that was for kids who lost a parent or sibling, and I think the organization either has or promotes a teen grief line? A few health organizations also have support hotlines. (I think I remember seeing those on the Prader-Willi organization and the HD youth network?). 

If you’re interested, I can see if I can find those resources again."
CoronavirusUS,fkscu3s,t3_fk6p69,1584487224.0,"Airports are definitely an odd place to be. I had no option but to fly yesterday (I have an eye problem and can’t drive, and I had to leave my college town) but if I didn’t absolutely have to, I would have cancelled for sure. 

Flew out of Birmingham yesterday, connected in Charlotte, landed in Richmond. Birmingham usually has very quick security, but yesterday it took maybe five minutes at the most. I asked a few people what it was like. TSA agent said he could go half an hour without seeing anyone come through. Check-in clerk said she saw maybe half a dozen people on some flights. There were so few people on my plane that everyone (aside from parents with small kiddos) got their own row. 

 The airport was so empty that the Starbucks was closed (usually a bad sign in an airport), as was the Chick-fil-a (always a bad sign in the south). Definitely not complaining about that, by the way. I’m relieved to see that they’re trying to slow transmission. I just hope their employees get some sort of paid leave. 

So Birmingham was very quick and clean. Charlotte was another we story. They’ve been renovating and I’m not sure if all concourses are open, but it was packed, even through my flight didn’t take off until 10 PM. No hand sanitizer anywhere (Birmingham has pumps scattered here and there), employees wearing masks with their noses exposed... Even saw a pilot cough into his hand which I’m. Even without a pandemic, eww. 

Yeah, it’s an odd place to be for sure. Feels like a bad science fiction movie."
