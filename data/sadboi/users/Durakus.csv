Whenever I greeted my friend I'd punch him in the arm. Or whenever something funny happened, again Id do it.

No matter what we do, we're intrinsically tied to a series of events. This includes not existing. This may not be particularly uplifting for some, but it's been covered before. By movies, books, etc. You name it, the scenario has been thought of.

Picture this:

You, downtrodden, beaten, sad, and a ""burden"". You think, okay. let's hit this button and stop existing. Retroactively.

You hit the button, and you're gone. Time and events change as if you never existed.

That person who almost ran you over that one year and slammed on their breaks? Well they didn't bother to hit their breaks this time, as no one was there. They passed the point you were crossing and decided they were safe, and looked away form the wheel. They hit a car they didn't see at an intersection and killed a young family.

The space you took up on a college course? The one you decided didn't matter because it didn't get you anywhere, and your life is still nothing? It was occupied instead by someone else. Turns out this someone else had severe mental instability and brought a loaded gun on campus killing 5 before killing himself.

You see, your mind can think of amazing things like ""If I didn't exist then my family wouldn't worry, and I wouldn't have to feel this way."" But that's incomplete thinking. You do exist, and if you didn't the world isn't necessarily a better place.

DebateAnAtheist,fn2apyy,t3_fywhoj,1586582753.0,"> Most of you probably do not believe in Atheism as a matter of will, not as a matter of so called lack of ""evidence.""

> In this case, you have willingly stopped believing that No god exists or could, not as a matter of lack of good evidence or lack of a way towards such evidence, but you have ceased believing and ceased the activity of open minded looking as a matter of choice (probably also due to despair, pessimism, cynicism and so on).

Hmm there seems to be quite the fundamental flaw in your argument here. See, if you flip the subjects around The argument is the exact same. 

No that can't be right, let me try again.

> Back to the main point. When you limit, as a matter of will, what can and cannot be ""allowed"" into your definition of truth (which is flattened so as to be devoid of Atheism), in so doing you limit your ability to ever know truth. You limit your ability to evolve and grow.

Nope, i'm not wrong. there it is. Change the subject and the argument hits the exact same. Why is that? I'll tell you why. because it's not an argument. I can easily dismiss all of this by saying ""I don't do that."" and what evidence do you have that I do? None.

How about going back to the drawing board and actually say something more compelling."

atheism,fmwsyua,t1_fmwr0wz,1586452485.0,"I agree with this to an extent. Experts are great for truly complex things. But a lot of issues and nuance we deal with is because of a severe lack of education and logic.

How do people get duped into goop and pyramid schemes? Lack of education. You don’t need an expert to know that “everything natural is good for you” is a lie. Yet here we are with people shoving rocks up their vagina. Critical thinking skills may take a few seconds longer than every day thought, but it’s not rocket science."

HaloStory,fmwlkcn,t1_fmvmr3a,1586448753.0,"Spartans feel pain like any other human. Their bones may not break as easily but their nerves are in their tissue and will still flare up. However they do have (At least the SII's definitely do) an adrenal rush feature where their brain essentially ignores or doesn't notice pain and bypasses the bodies shock responses. But once they begin to slow down the chemistry likely returns to normal and The Spartan will experience severe side-effects and Pain.

However Lucy's musings over pain is actually Unique. Lucy suffers from severe PTSD. If you recall Lucy, after the disastrous operation that left her mentally scarred, remarked that maybe they can't be sure ""If they're really alive"". So feeling and musings on pain is a realisation: She is alive. Not a testament to what a spartan Should and shouldn't feel."
