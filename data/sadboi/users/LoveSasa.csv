A quick Google search gave me this:
""Trauma bond is the connection formed between a victim and their abuser(s), often built during long-term abuse. ... In many instances, the psychological impact of trauma bond can be more harmful than the abuse itself, with children finding it difficult to come to terms with what is happening.""
Source: https://www.nfa.co.uk/story/blog-news/what-is-a-trauma-bond-and-how-can-it-affect-children-and-young-people/

And this:
""...the field of clinical psychotherapy continues to struggle with examining why some severely abused children have trouble disconnecting from their abuser and forgetting them. Some children, as difficult as it is to believe, continue to desire the nurturing and accepting love of an abusive parent, even long after they have been removed from the abusive home environment.""

progresspics,ez9m2ic,t3_d0du02,1567785157.0,"You look great!

I think when you get closer to the ""normal"" range on the BMI scale, it becomes less useful. 

The only time I was a ""healthy"" BMI was when I was in high school and my first year of college. I was working out 2+ hours a day and was very (probably unhealthily) strict with what I ate. Friends who knew me then have described me as ""a stick with an ass."" Not a great look, and honestly probably not very  healthy. I later gained a lot of weight because I didn't know how to find a healthy balance.

When I have lost weight as an adult, I've found that I'm only able to maintain if I stay around 130-140lbs, which is also a weight that looks good on me. Per the BMI scale, 130 is the TOP of the healthy weight range for my height (5'2"") and anything above that is ""overweight."" I have very muscular legs and a large butt, so 130lbs and below is just not realistic for me, my body composition, and my lifestyle. 

At this point, you might consider switching from going by the scale to going by body measurements, body fat % and general body composition rather than BMI."
Hypothyroidism,ez8lch5,t3_d04cno,1567747450.0,"My blood pressure (104/70) and resting heart rate (58) are both very low. 

I just got diagnosed with hypothyroidism and started taking Levo 2 weeks ago. My temperature has improved (no longer constantly freezing). Per my FitBit HR, my resting heart rate hasn't changed.  I'm curious to see if my blood pressure has changed. I'll ask them to check at my follow up appointment. 

I'm currently very out of shape and have an obese BMI, so my heart rate and blood pressure are definitely not due to being fit. When I was younger and a healthy weight and athletic, my blood pressure was on the very low end of the normal range."
