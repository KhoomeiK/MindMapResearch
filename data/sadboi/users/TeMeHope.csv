Whiskey isn't being condescending??? Just trying to be friendly, appeasing, placating, etc. etc.? You have got to stop assuming everyone is being angry or insinuating something or other. How does their post read condescending? Maybe you're the one who's taking everything too much to heart? 

I know you're going say something rude about my post, something about how I'm being rude or accusatory but I'll say this anyways. That is not the intention. I just want people to get along.

When OP said 500km, he probably meant he looked online, posts within 500km radius. The person wasn't bashing? We just mean OP should look for a little bit longer that's all. He doesn't have to, he's not obligated. But he seems like a good guy. We just hope he will."

It's funny. Someone attempts diplomacy, they're ""masquerading elitism"" and they're pretentious. Someone focuses their concern on the bird instead of OP, and you think they're being rude and contemptuous. Hard to satisfy huh?

If I can bother to scroll through the comments to answer yours, then please understand I've already read his replies. A 500km radius? For a pet animal??? This man is fucking wonderful.  Please don't assume I'm like whoever you're mad at. Stop generalizing and hold back on the fact that the people who disagree with you are all the same. The one thing we all share is we want the bird in the best hands possible right? If the owners are gone, fuck, I'm glad this man is here to take care of the bird. If not, and if there's a 5% chance this guy's owner is out there looking for him, then I'm going to hope this guy is going to keep looking too.

I'm getting pretty fed up with people like you. WHY WOULD I BE PRETENTIOUS I'M SORRY?? WHAT DO I HAVE TO GAIN??

I don't know how to tell you but I was genuine, I am genuine, if you choose not to believe me lmao what can I say, right? I can tell you I have lost a bird myself. Obviously I can go into a sob story but it sounds like virtue signaling too, doesn't it? I have emails, posters saved, messages from people I reached out to looking for my bird saved on my computer. If you'd like I can pull them up. In the meantime, know that I mean what I say. I've lost a bird, I've been devastated.

It is amazing someone has put the effort to look for the owners of the little guy. It is my hope he will do so for a little longer.

You're right. I could've done, ""some things you can do to increase your chance of finding them!"" I didn't think he was going to read all the comments here so I kept my message short. (Jokes on me I guess now haha;)

Of course, we should all be civil. The person apologized if you'd read all. More importantly, what's more important? Pride, or the bird being reunited with its owner? OP's a grown man who can survey 500km to find a bird's owner? He can take one or two people worried about the bird to the point where they deliver their address a little bit poorly.

Cool your head.  


Good luck to OP."
cockatiel,fma5zb3,t3_ftpp51,1585884690.0,"Hey there! I've read a few of the other comments/and replies you've made but I wanted to say something anyways; I hope I don't overlap too much.

You may also want to try r/Ontario and some of the area subreddits if you haven't already. I hope you will also continue searching for the owner! I know the sub and I appreciate you for searching for the owner, I just want to beg you to continue being on the lookout for an owner. I know you're not obligated to make the effort, and I know you weren't in the first place either but I know as a past pet owner, you care about the bird, its health and its happiness, so I believe you'd be willing to continue to?

As many of the individuals have mentioned, tiels can fly really far. 30 km isn't impossible for it to do and a remarkable bird can probably do more. I've heard stories where people have been reunited with their birds after weeks or even months, simply because they've missed each other's lost/found resources.

If you'd be willing to send more photos I would like to help search! If you don't mind, I'd be happy to discuss resources you have and haven't covered yet as to not overlap.

Otherwise thank you for all you've done."

No one is saying OP has done anything wrong; we're not assuming he's an asshole, and no one is treating him poorly. We're glad this bird was found by someone who can take care of him temporarily.

We all care heavily about the little lost guy and the owners who must be sick with worry, because we know we could be those people, or we have been those people.

Many of us may have been struck uncertain by the title, reading the quick date and OP labeling the bird as abandoned when it is almost certain the bird is lost.

Not to sound too centrist but we're all good people. We all want the bird to be okay; we're happy someone found him and can take care of him right now, we're just worried someone else is out there looking for him :/"
Markham,fm6spz4,t3_fte315,1585802178.0,Hey there! I'm not the owner but I just saw this post and want to make sure you'll be okay taking care of the little guy for now (have the right resources). Otherwise I'll ask around!

literature,fl625e9,t1_fl5l2nw,1584852069.0,"Sorry for the vague wording! (I just reread my response and I realized it could be interpreted sarcastic? Not my intention!)  
I went down a similar path when I was first learning about him I think (hoped to see some other works he'd written?) But yeah. Some of his less-moral behaviors can be justified (sort of gray area?) but eugenics was a big uhoh. Anyways, thanks for listening :p What are you reading right now?"

love,fkzqqiw,t3_flgxuo,1584677658.0,"What you need is closure. 

Tell her how you feel, as in tell her all of this (not just that you have feelings for her, but that there are regrets you have had, maybe misunderstandings that you'd like to clear up). 

 There's nothing wrong with feeling like you're in love, even as hard as it is at times, but there is a reality you have to meet, and you'll get there by telling her and figuring out what she really thinks instead of listening to what's in your head. Best of luck."

I'm not in the area unfortunately; just wanted to make a warning note; would highly not recommend posting to kijij any ""sale/trade"" sites!! ; a lot of people do resale, not looking for good owners so much as they are looking for money. Please be careful! I wish your birds the best!"

I'm so terribly sorry to hear all of this; Feeling lost is only understandable. it's a lot of weight to have on you in one period. :/ I'm glad you felt comfortable enough to come to this subreddit.

I'm not sure if I can be of any immediate help, but I would like to try! Please message me if you want to talk further. Best wishes in any case <3"
