harrypotter,fqbd94z,t1_fqbc8dy,1589234855.0,"I thought that too, which is why I missed it as a metaphor. It seems strange that they wouldn’t do that, but maybe they thought Moaning Myrtle was a good enough deterrent (maybe a bit too good). But it doesn’t really explain the other toilets that there surely must be considering it’s a massive castle, but admittedly I haven’t read far enough to say whether there are any more ghosts in the toilets at Hogwarts which could potentially act as a deterrent."

AskVet,fo3xc3x,t3_g0k3ca,1587494536.0,"Update: After regular cleaning of my house, using flea spray weekly on carpets and bedding and continuing my cats flea treatment, my cat no longer has these scabs around her head and is no longer scratching so frequently. After checking her, I found that she had flea dirt on her chin which proved to me that the reaction she was having was most likely due to fleas and I didn't need to give her any medication. I guess it just shows how important it is to have a clean home not only for yourself but for your pets as well, and it is certainly a lesson learnt on my part."
AskVet,fnendbu,t1_fnen8js,1586892448.0,Thanks for helping out! I’ll give them a call as soon as I can!
AskVet,fnemgt8,t1_fna339j,1586891993.0,"Could you suggest to me where I could call to get more advice? The only place that I could think of calling is the RSPCA but they are only taking emergency calls. Or should I just call my local vets in my area to ask for advice? I haven’t taken her to the vet yet because I haven’t had her for that long and she was taken by her previous owner had only just had her checked up and vaccinated (I was given proof that this was the case) so I didn’t see it as necessary. Is it okay to call a vet where she isn’t registered at? Sorry if I sound ignorant, she’s the first cat that I have owned myself."
TransChristianity,fl7urc7,t1_fl7th4r,1584909811.0,"The mention of arsenokoitēs which debatably is translated to homosexuality is certainly not in reference to the homosexual relationships that we have today. Ancient Greek and Roman cultures did practice homosexual acts, but they were in no way similar to the loving ones we have today. Most likely the mention of arsenokoitēs in the Bible was not referring to the sexual relationships between men, but more likely forbidding the disgusting perverted nature of the examples they had in their time, including pedophilia, sexual perversion and adultery. What I meant by my comment is that there is no mention of anything similar to loving gay couples. I cannot imagine that God has any aversion towards the modern gay relationship if you love God and stick to the commandments. Of course I can’t claim to know the nature of God, but no human is free of sin and God is the God of all mankind, including homosexual and transgender people."
TransChristianity,fl7epjh,t3_fn3njz,1584900206.0,"Homosexuality only became a sin within the Bible in the 40s after the second English translation was published. Unfortunately after this was published they couldn’t revise it for 10 years, within these years other translations would follow suit. The Bible does not mention homosexuality within the slightest. You are not a sinner for being transgender because God made you that way for a reason. It is not a mistake. He knew you when you were in your mother’s womb and His choices were intentional. You were formed to be the person you are today. I hope your family will come to accept you in time and that you will live your life with happiness and faith."

I don’t expect you to elaborate if it makes you feel uncomfortable, but please message me if you need someone to talk to. Remember that there are always people out there who you can speak to, even randoms on the internet! Please reach out if you feel like you can. If you feel like you are in an abusive situation I implore you to seek out help. I’m not sure where you are from so I unfortunately can’t give you any contacts, but please, please reach out to anyone who can help if you are in any danger or you feel like you need help."
ftm,faac4as,t1_fa97wuj,1575906767.0,"My friend, read all of the comments. It is clear that you are not alone! You are valid no matter how you presented yourself in the past, how you present yourself now and how you will present yourself in the future. We all have experimented with our gender and no one should make you feel ashamed for it. I understand that it is hard to tell people and unfortunately to the outside world they expect everything to be black and white. Don’t ever let anyone make you feel bad for expressing who you are. I also understand the shame that you feel, the longing to bury them phases and pretend that they didn’t happen. All you can do is be yourself authentically, no matter what anyone says. It’s the path to true happiness. You will get there my friend, but never stop to care about what anyone thinks. It sounds easier than it is, I know, but once you do it’ll all be worth it. Good luck. I’m rooting for you!"

ftm,fa8kqrl,t1_fa8isoa,1575848506.0,"I had it at a similar age and it was because I wanted to be more attractive to boys in general. I was almost objectifying myself because I thought that's what men wanted from me, but in fact it just lead to a load of heartbreak and trauma. In the same way, I was quite terrible acting as a girl, it never really fit. I think most of my exes knew this but took advantage of my insecurities. Coming out as trans gave me the self confidence to not just settle for anyone that would take me and instead I became my own person. Very upsetting times indeed, but I am lucky to say that I got through it, but it did leave me with a few scars."

ftm,fa8fsxd,t1_fa8ehp6,1575845622.0,"Literally a week before I came out as trans I was trying to grow my hair out and I was about to get hair extensions to look more like a ‘girl’. It’s funny because now whenever my hair gets long enough to touch my ears, I get so dysphoric that I can’t even look in the mirror! I know once I get hormones and top surgery, I’ll be much more comfortable with growing my hair out and maybe experimenting with makeup again, but for the time being I try my darnedest to look as masc as possible. Stupid gender roles making me feel dysphoric af!"

I still love the look of makeup and I find it fascinating, but now I appreciate it in a different way and I see it more as an art form rather than a costume to hide my true self"

ftm,fa8ddm5,t1_fa8c4tr,1575844775.0,"When I was going through this phase, it was very feminine but distinctly different to what a cis woman would be. It was very fake and I never really knew how to be a girl so I just did what I thought was right. Now looking back it was so obvious that I didn’t really know what I was doing. That’s why I like to call it drag. Feminine, but not female."
ftm,fa8cwl3,t1_fa8bxdr,1575844496.0,"I was in the same boat. I was constantly in and out of relationships and I felt like no one would love me if I was trans. I even came out to one of my exes and he threatened to break up with me, which only further perpetuated the phase. After the last breakup I had had enough and I came out a day later. Now I’m in a happy relationship which has lasted over 3 years now with a cis man who accepts me for who I really am!"
ftm,fa89m91,t1_fa88nyo,1575843263.0,"Of course! I’ve always had this insecurity that I wasn’t trans enough because there are a load of feminine things that I like. Not that I’ve been made fun of for liking them things, but there’s always that pressure to be hyper masculine especially being a trans guy. I always felt like a femme gay man which made it even more confusing. I’m glad to know that there are trans men like me!"
ftm,fa88fpl,t1_fa88bwl,1575842819.0,EXACTLY! This is exactly how I felt!
ftm,fa88cjf,t1_fa87zc1,1575842764.0,"Yeah, I kinda had a similar experience. I felt like it was expected of me to dress in that way and I was more looking for approval than anything else. I was also terrified of the idea of being trans and I tried to bury it with makeup and clothes, but it never really worked. Coming out was such a freeing experience!"
