creepyencounters,fpfc41h,t3_gb93ag,1588567000.0,I used to work at a gas station. Many regulars could be a bit too ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù. One would call to see when I was working. I saw this man at the grocery store and immediately went the opposite way hoping he didn‚Äôt see me. Another man came in drunk with bloody hands just before 11 pm closing saying he beat someone up for me. He proceeded to give me his number and address to come over after. So many stories from working there. I was around 21f. Working there made me a firm believer that jobs like that should not require name tags. People are too fucking creepy.
