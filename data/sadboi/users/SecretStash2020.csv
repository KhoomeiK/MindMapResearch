bipolar,fqwoxzn,t3_gl7vca,1589712533.0,Hard work pays off!!! This is fabulous news! Congratulations. Keep going !!! <3
depression,fq8j28n,t3_gh7lxw,1589167347.0,"Thank you <3  Just celebrated my own ""SELF-mothering'""on Mothers Day. Make a self care/self mothering day out of it. It's all about US today :-) YOU deserve all the love and care!! :)"
mentalhealth,fq8ihte,t3_gh5k0z,1589166971.0,Amen to that!
bipolar,fq5da4z,t3_ggvb59,1589100985.0,"My weekend is coming to an end now. but I did a workout, some light housework, fruit and veg shopping trip, had a couple naps, read a bit of a good novel and went for a scenic drive around town with some music on... Pretty low key, chilled.

What about yourself ??"
raisedbynarcissists,fpzi8mz,t3_gg0avx,1589018591.0,"I hate it!! ... and I hate the guilt I feel for hating it.  FML. I hate it just as much as I hate every other ""event"". Birthdays, Easters, Christmases, New Years....I am just a really bitter person with a memory bank of heavy, negative emotional experiences running my world view. I hate feeling like this, too...but...it is how I feel. I can't fake ""happy family"" any more and I'd be disrespecting myself if I did. Erhh... It will be over in 24 hours and come again next year. Yay. :-("
DysfunctionalFamily,fpy12bw,t1_fpv8d0m,1588993715.0,"Thank you.  And, totally, I get you. If you can, I suggest to just maintain your point of view and don't back down with the gaslighting. I hope you can end the gaslighting with something like, ""Well, this is how I feel and I'd appreciate it for you to respect my feelings."" Or, even say, ""how would you actually feel if I was to do this to you? Can you try to put yourself in my shoes?"" (This usually ends the argument pretty quick!)    This situation sucks, ey. You're in a double bind. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. And sadly this should never be the case in any relationship.... But, here we are.. . *hugs*"
DysfunctionalFamily,fpufbwm,t3_gfj96d,1588911481.0,"I know how this can feel. It is so awful. I have had to stay away from my sister because of this. She is actually younger than me and tries to show she knows better than me and doesn't suggest things, just orders me to do things differently. She is always trying to 'mother' me. My sister does this type of thing; (That is, ""Create a solution to a problem that doesn't even exist for you/you have already sorted"". It takes courage to express how you feel and I believe the only way this type of thing goes away is when you inform the other person of what is irritating you. It does have the potential to rock the relationship though, especially if the other person is used to patronizing/dominance over you, as well as you being silent/submissive (which is also like me). Assertive statements like, ""Thank you for caring, Sis, but I really just need to be trusted that I've got a plan and will ask for help if and when I need it. I feel micromanaged and smothered at the moment so a little bit of space would really help me right now. I hope you can understand and I hope this doesn't hurt you...."" (Or something) :)"

bipolar,fpg1q6r,t3_gd3vk5,1588591492.0,Feels so good to get that task done. It is the one I put off the most yet enjoy the benefits of the most!! I was so happy for you whilst I was reading this post - I have felt that elation just from a 'simple' re-dressing of the bed. It is the little things that can have the biggest impact on mental health. I feel you! :) :)
bipolar,fm3vadc,t3_fsqtk5,1585738340.0,"I feel and relate to this so much. All I can do is send you a *hug* and help you feel validated. I have no friends either. I generally dislike people. They're a nuisance to me. I can't work anymore. I couldn't hold a job long either. I feel really short changed by life, too. It sucks. I feel you."

Never mind people losing money, jobs and lives and those that are doing the right thing, I'm related to two tit-wanks of women who think they are soooo perfect that the world around them are beneath them and they themselves are superior to the rest of humanity and are cruel enough to show blatant disregard for the world around them.

depression,fl099yd,t3_exo6f1,1584697260.0,"When will I enjoy things again? My life is so pathetic and I can't be bothered changing it either. Every day that goes by I'm glad it's gone. I wish someone would come and wrap their arms around me and tell me everything is taken care of and I don't need to worry about anything anymore. Why the fuck am I even here - why do I exist. This experience called ""Life"" is horseshit. Wish I was never born."
depression_help,fkycdra,t1_fkxzdij,1584645942.0,"It could be time for a change in interest but it also isn't uncommon to experience this. Relationship difficulties can really affect your confidence, self esteem and feelings of connection and belonging - which are all really a part of mental health, too. When one part is out of balance, it can affect other areas of the brain, including concentration. Something to try is just doing something for the hell of it. No one ever died from a ""crappy drawing"" but if your heart isn't in it to begin with, then you are likely not going to enjoy the end result. Perhaps instead of drawing art, wander off to a gallery and just appreciate art. Look at what other people come up with - sometimes I wonder how a simple line drawn on canvass makes it to a wall in a gallery - open up your style of art to new possibilities perhaps? These are only suggestions. It sucks to feel like this. You are in a healing process and it takes time. Give yourself a little break and let time and inspiration take hold when you are drawn to it. :)"

ForeverAlone,fkx4l36,t3_fl3ppm,1584618502.0,"I relate to this Post so much. The last paragraph really hit home, for me. You are not alone - in your feeling this way and also in your response to peoples' comments they've made in your life. It is so heartbreaking to feel like no one gets you, let alone be minimised, patronised and shamed for your feelings. I feel the pain. Trust me. I don't blame myself for just living my days till I die one day. I have isolated to the point where I don't talk to anyone except the people at the grocery store checkouts. I have given up on many areas of my life. I'm not proud of that but I also can't be bothered caring much either. Life's disappointments can become a weight to big to bare these days. Anyway, I am so sad that you feel this way, too. I wouldn't want anyone to feel this lost as I do. It sucks. It's also a very long and lonely road to travel. :-("

depression_help,fktrfu5,t3_fkf1no,1584532149.0,I have done this a lot. mostly in recent weeks. It has become a really addictive coping mechanism - to find / plan a way to escape. I am seeing my doc soon - that is the only thing barely keeping me here.

I just want the pain to end. So glad another day is over. It is one less I have to do over again."

The ups and downs can really throw a person around in their brain chemistry... Perhaps it's just a feeling of overwhelm and release. Crying can feel exhausting but also can be very healing, too."
