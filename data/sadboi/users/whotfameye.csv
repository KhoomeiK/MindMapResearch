AlAnon,ff54pyh,t3_ero3xr,1579580176.0,"I am no expert and not qualified to give you advice but there are similarities in our stories so I wanted to share. 

My husband has picked up our son from daycare drunk, he knows he has a problem, and thinks he can fix it himself. I‚Äôve seen him try to ‚Äúfix it himself‚Äù for over 4 years now. 

Every person is different, but I do know that continuing to try, over and over again, using the same methods doesn‚Äôt work. Maybe the medication will help, maybe he won‚Äôt take it, maybe he needs to talk to someone. 

But, what do YOU need? I need peace of mind, absence of fear and anxiety, I need to KNOW that my kids are safe. I think the same thoughts as you, if I stay, can I better protect my kids simply by being here, or am I making this worse by continuing to put up with it and expose them to this? 95% of the time, great father, great provider, but that 5% of the time, and not knowing when to expect it is slowly killing me. 

I have not yet found the courage to do the things that I need to do. I have only just started to admit to myself that I need to do something. My kids are my priority but I know I cannot forget about myself either. That is what is confuses everything for me, it gets all jumbled in my head until I don‚Äôt really trust what I‚Äôm supposed to do. 

It‚Äôs a long road, even for the ones affected by drinking, but we need to do whatever it is that needs to be done to help ourselves. I‚Äôve lost so much of myself in this that I‚Äôm no longer concerned about my happiness, it‚Äôs been survival mode for so long that I don‚Äôt even think about it. 

I hope this didn‚Äôt make things worse for you, just wanted you to know, you‚Äôre not alone..."

AlAnon,eov82y8,t3_bt6zf7,1558890343.0,"If something doesn‚Äôt change, and change quickly, this will be my post. 3 years ago my husband attempted to pick up our 18 month old son from daycare, blacked out drunk. Luckily they recognized he was not right and did not let him leave with our son. After that he quit drinking for a year to convince himself he could control it. We had a daughter, now there are two to protect. Since then he‚Äôs started again and obviously it is only apparent to me that he cannot control ‚Äúit‚Äù. I know I have to do something so this does not happen again. These are my babies..."
