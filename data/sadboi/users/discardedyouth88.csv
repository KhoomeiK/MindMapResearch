From Pete walker's cPTSD FAQ ---[http://pete-walker.com/fAQsComplexPTSD.html#misdiagnosed](http://pete-walker.com/fAQsComplexPTSD.html#misdiagnosed)

>What  may I have been misdiagnosed with?  
>  
>Renowned  traumatologist, John Briere, is said to have  quipped that if Complex PTSD were  ever given its due – that is, if the  role of dysfunctional parenting in adult  psychological disorders was  ever fully recognized, the DSM (The Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders used by all mental health professionals)  would  shrink to the size of a thin pamphlet. It currently resembles a large   dictionary. In my experience, many clients with Complex PTSD have been   misdiagnosed with various anxiety and depressive disorders, as well as  bipolar,  narcissistic, codependent and borderline disorders. Further  confusion arises in  the case of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactive  Disorder), as well as  obsessive/compulsive disorder, which is sometimes  more accurately  described  as an excessive, fixated  flight response  to trauma. This is also true of ADD (Attention Deficit  Disorder) and  some dissociative disorders which are similarly excessive,  fixated  freeze responses to trauma. (See my article “A Trauma Typology”.)   
>  
>This is not to say that those so diagnosed do  not  have issues that are similar and correlative with said disorders, but  that  these labels are incomplete and unnecessarily shaming descriptions  of what the  client is afflicted with. Calling complex PTSD “panic  disorder” is like calling  food allergies chronically itchy eyes;  over-focusing treatment on the symptoms  of panic in the former case and  eye health in the latter does little to get at  root causes. Feelings  of panic or itchiness in the eyes can be masked with  medication, but  all the other associated problems that cause these symptoms  will remain  untreated. Moreover most of the diagnoses mentioned above imply  deep  innate characterological defects rather than the learned maladaptations  to  stress that children of trauma are forced to make– adaptations, once  again that  were learned and can therefore usually be extinguished and  replaced with more  functional adaptations to stress.  
>  
>In  this vein, I believe that many substance and process  addictions also begin as  misguided, maladaptations to parental abuse  and abandonment – early adaptations  that are attempts to soothe and  distract from the mental and emotional pain of  complex PTSD."

I agree with this. That said what about things like the unmentionable DS which has been called a demon by HHDL and apparently causes harm in the real world?"

Hardcore,fjag9xt,t1_fjaf3i8,1583172888.0,">I was half making a connection between the numbers/meaning of ""88"" and boneheads.

Understood and fair enough. 

TBH when I set up this user account I didn't think about the nazi connection at all. Now with that being said it's turned out to but an interesting thing. I get to see how people make assumptions and having that 88 does generate conversation, which is good or at least entertaining. 

Oh and it keeps regressives away which is an added bonus."
Hardcore,fjaermx,t1_fjad4u0,1583171998.0,">From an outside perspective, one might think that someone who posts in a skinhead sub and has 88 in their user name is a nazi skinhead.

Sounds like stereotyping to me. That's said I can see how it's an easy assumption to make if one is being lazy. Not that I'm calling you lazy. 

Y'all know that most skins aren't NAZI right?

In my world the only real difference between a Hardcore Punk and a Hardcore Skin is beer money. 

The 88 is a reference to the year and more specifically [this newspaper article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mDuxREDYqxR1kifMalZr7j8mAeezg8V_/view) which I am featured in."

It's early and I clearly need more caffeine.

Edit: Still would like to know if there is something (and what it is that's) wrong with posting to a skin sub?"
