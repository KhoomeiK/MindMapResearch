When I was 16 I withdrew from all christian churches. (Churches are linked to taxes in germany.) 

I was always drawn to occultism, witchcraft and could agree to various teachings like taoism, shintoism and hinduism. But every religion seems to restrict a being in some way. 

You can also identify as atheist or no label at all. Identifying with satanism came naturally after reading into it."
conspiracy,f4724ks,t3_djpiyy,1571416438.0,"I‘ve been reading this book „The secret history of the world“ which explains exactly that. It states that Lucifer wanted humans to live free and make their own decisions while god wanted to keep the order in „paradise“. As soon as humans tasted the fruit of knowledge, god banished them and sent Lucifer to „Hell“. It further states that while Lucifer was falling, the stone in his crown that is associated with clear sight, divination, the third eye so to say, fell out on the earth, making us „blind“ to the dimensions/ gods/ angels/ you name it, that exist with us here on earth. 
It was an interesting read for sure and I do recommend it. 

I think we have indeed been blinded. People do desperate things for the slightest sign of hope. That‘s what makes them relate to religion. As soon as something good happens to them, it was god. 
Saw this just yesterday on „Rhythm and Flow“ when a contestant thanked god TWICE for passing the audition. Chance the Rapper in the jury had this look on his face. This „no, it was ME who made you pass.“ 

As a satanist, I cant relate to thanking god. Let‘s discuss."
