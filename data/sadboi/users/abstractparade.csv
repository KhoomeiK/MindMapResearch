thebachelor,ew378vw,t1_evwrtcl,1565066544.0,How would you know it’s not objective if you weren’t there? You sound like a pretentious dick yourself🤣🤣get over yourself
thebachelor,evy6gjd,t1_evxcxfk,1564924080.0,Thanks. I wasn’t going to share this but felt obligated to since the response to OP’s post was so awful.
thebachelor,evy6b7w,t1_evwod3e,1564923935.0,Sounds like you’re Kind of a Dick yourself
thebachelor,evx46i5,t1_evx3d2i,1564881385.0,you should be
thebachelor,evx412r,t1_evwj8yv,1564881261.0,"bruh, the event was for him to meet his fans, lol, so no, you're not really allowed to deny fans, and if you do, it's considered rude. you clearly have no manners either"
thebachelor,evx3sxs,t1_evwkxsp,1564881078.0,"celebrities owe you nothing, 

unless the event was designed for them to owe you something (like this one). 

&#x200B;

Funny how none of you know that he was running at an event in NYC that was planned for him to meet his fans. True ignorance, lol."
thebachelor,evx3jj2,t1_evwjj2z,1564880867.0,your plans? he was at an NYC run that WAS DESIGNED for him to run with / meet his fans. It's not like he was taking a stroll on an average day! Know your facts first!
thebachelor,evx3bpw,t3_clnis9,1564880693.0,"I was at this NYC run that Tyler was at on this day and can confirm he is not approachable, ignored me and three friends who asked to take a picture with him. Funny how people who were not even there are so quick to defend a reality star that they have never met in their life!"

loveafterlockup,ertdcfv,t3_c3gf6e,1561239197.0,"1) I can't stand to watch Michael and his lies. Pretty sure he routinely lies to himself too. 

2) Megan might be the most desperate sight I've ever laid eyes on. 

3) Sarah needs to take it upon herself to INITIATE a divorce. I feel for her but she allows herself to get strung along. This loser will not change, not today, not tomorrow, not ever!!!!

4) Tracie looks like she is run over by a truck more and more each episode. I wouldn't want her in my house either if I were Clint's mom. 

5) Andrea pulling her innocent kids to LA for an ex-con like Lamar who is in and out of jail is painful to watch. Cmon woman, have you no sense?!!!! 

6) Is it just me or is Marcellino a jerk? Seems to always have an attitude! 

Can't wait for next week!!!"
loveafterlockup,ertcv8o,t1_errdix1,1561238823.0,u are the only one that thinks shes looking good lol

loveafterlockup,ertazue,t3_c3taob,1561237343.0,Megan is dumb as a rock and Michael is dumb and always high. They're a good match.
loveafterlockup,ertaup5,t3_c3qi6n,1561237232.0,my thoughts exactly lol
loveafterlockup,ertaosn,t1_ert4yx0,1561237103.0,yeah I agree.  I think she has some serious self-esteem issues to work out.
