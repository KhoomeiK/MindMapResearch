There is no cure for TS, and I fell the sooner the individual can except that this is the hand they have been given, they can take it and run with it. It helps to just realize that they don’t know what this is like. They don’t know the how hard it is, and trust me if they did they wouldn’t give you crap. So I say embrace it and realize that tegu have no clue what it is really like. I fell you! ❤️❤️❤️"

Tell your daughter that what she is doing is amazing and I hope one day that I will achieve something like her and be able to be as inspirational as your child."
