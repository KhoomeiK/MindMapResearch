writing,fpsnu23,t3_gf93py,1588876618.0,"Creative writing has helped me hone my writing skills and really helped me in college with essays (especially for scholarship applications). In fact, there was a high-quality college I applied to way back in the day that I *didn't* get into only because of the ""turn in an essay from your high school that your teachers have given you feedback on"" portion of the application--my high school's writing standards were not rigorous enough, and so I set out to improve that skill on my own.

  
I am now the treasurer for my college's creative writing club, and am learning many skills such as group work and communication that will help me in my future. I am in the business program, and the two things that companies say students need more of are the abilities to work well in a team, and communication skills--both of which I am improving by being in the club.

&#x200B;

Writing is a practical skill that will help your academic future. Whether or not you can convince them of this, I highly suggest you continue writing as it is true. However, make certain you are getting enough sleep, or your grades truly will suffer. To be honest, I have been working on my novel for years (school does take up a lot of my attention). The ideas don't disappear, and even if you only have enough time to get out 300 words or so a day, you will eventually finish your novel."

[https://www.psychologytoday.com/](https://www.psychologytoday.com/) is a great resource, and I read their articles all the time. The top four results from a google search are:  [Effective communication during relationship conflict](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/201703/effective-communication-during-relationship-conflict)  [intimacy and communication](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/201905/intimacy-and-communication)  [communicating mindfully in relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/conscious-communication/201709/communicating-mindfully-in-relationships) and [problematic styles of communication in relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/magnetic-partners/201910/problematic-styles-communication-in-relationships). I have not read these particular articles, but I trust the site. One excerpt from the second article might be useful to you:

""It’s not that communication techniques are inherently bad. The better ones are like the better diet tips (eat less, move more) — speak respectfully, listen attentively. But they’re unhelpful because people communicate primarily by emotional states, not words""  


I don't know of a romantic relationship communication class, although I am sure there are countless out there. Instead, I started with a quality free classes website I already know (edX), and found this: 

 [https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-human-communication](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-human-communication)   


One thing I will say is that you are going to do a much better job learning if you ""look for the bright spots"" and the times you have done well, as well as get support from your fiance and positive feedback."
communication,fnmxte9,t3_g2nn3m,1587080264.0,"Wanting to change is already a huge step on the path toward learning good communication. There are a few different great books I could recommend, one is ""Switch: how to change when change is hard"" by Heath and Heath. It provides a good guide on how to change. The second book is ""The 5 Love Languages"" while I don't believe that it is a relationship bible, it did have some examples of relationship difficulties that remind me of yours. In particular, it mentioned a marriage where one of the spouse's ways of showing their love was through *words*, and it sounds like that might be the case for your nearly-fiance. **Look for small and actionable steps you can take to communicate with her more freely.**  


Learning how to communicate with your partner the way that they like to communicate is important. **What does** ***she*** **mean by  ""communicate like we used to?"" What did that look like when it was successful? You've done it before, and you know how to do it again.**  Ask your fiance for examples of times she thinks you have communicated well with her.  


In addition, it sounds like your definitions of talks and arguments are different. Arguments don't have to be bad! If you want to learn more about that, I suggest you read John Gottman's ""4 horsemen of the relationship apocalypse"" and **look into what can come off as an argument to different people.**  


You said that you don't talk to her like you used to now that her sister is around because she would "" would tell her sister everything,"" however, **your soon-to-be-sister-in-law isn't just going to disappear when you get married.** Do you want to be married to someone who you can't talk to just because you're scared they'll tell their sister everything? My point here isn't that you should break up, but that sisters talk to each other. They likely talked before she moved in. Some families share more than others, and that is okay. Have you told her ""I am uncomfortable with the idea that your sister might learn things about me that I consider private?"" If she already knows this and isn't going to stop talking to her sister, then you need to either accept it as the price of admission and learn how to be okay with it, or find another compromise. Consider what information you are actually scared of your sister in law knowing--why are you scared of this? can your fiance respect that some topics are just between the two of you? If so, are those topics things that are too heavy to force her to bear on her own? If so, can you two get a therapist to share that with instead of sharing it with her sister? There are options. Communication and relationships are not about ultimatums, but understanding one another.  


If this is a situation problem that will be solved when her sister moves out, do you have a plan for her sister moving out? 

&#x200B;

TLDR; 1) you already know what she wants as far as communication goes, so that is not the issue here--if I am reading this correctly. 2) you need to deal with your fear of her sister knowing personal things about you. 3) This could be a situation problem rather than a skill problem. 4) ask your fiance when you two have communicated well, and try to do those things more often."

I'd suggest a lock box for your food and move the things you don't think are kitchen supplies to your room."

writing,fjyyijz,t3_ffe8q5,1583707327.0,"I have too many really great ideas, and while I don't post ""can I do this?"" posts, I often ask myself if I can or not. Not *may* I, buy *can* I. It's a question of technical skill. Can I pull off this crazy idea I have and make a story that people will want to read? The answer is more nuanced than just YES. However, yes I can is what I am operating from until I can get this story done. I keep running into roadblocks for my current bat sh\*t story. Honest roadblocks. So what I tell myself is: this is a *rough draft* and it can be as bat sh\*t as it needs to be to get the words out. At the end, editing and rewriting, is when I will worry about the bats. I'll see if I need to get out a shovel, or reroute a whole river to clean up their sh\*t."

writers,fjsguq0,t3_fev6xr,1583596829.0,"There are some great tablet coloring guides online. Add more layers. Copy an opaque layer of everything and use the burn tool to darken shadows, and add highlight. Then make another much more opaque layer to go over everything in a single color. This will provide cohesion. Add a more complex background if you can. Even if it's just a hallway.

Oh! The first thing you should do is make a pallet of colors for each hair, shirt, face, etc. Make each thing a different layer, select that item so you have a guide. Now add depth/light with those different shades of the same color. Blur just a little bit.

My father is an artist and he always said that the two ways to improve once you get to a certain point are: a) take a life drawing class. And b) draw a comic. Drawing the same characters over and over really improves your skill. I suggest that you redraw the cover once you finish the comic. It will show you how much you've improved!"

It's how my ribs are. I am much shorter than you, but my parents look like an amazon and a hobit, and I ended up average in *nearly* every way. With how tall you are, it sounds like you are proportionate."
