AskReddit,fqsjeqm,t3_gkktb3,1589608946.0,"I used to 100% approve of porn. But now...not so much. I'm not gonna preach and tell others not to watch it. But as someone who used to be flat out addicted to porn, I think it can be psychologically harmful. First off, I think it dehumanizes the idea of intimacy, and rewires your brain to view it through a lustful perspective, which in return takes away the essence of what intimacy is supposed to be. It sort of numbs your mind to romance, and makes you simply hyperfocus on one aspect, which is sex. I think that's what's wrong with the newer generation, including mine. Porn has numbed our minds and has basically turned a lot of people into sex addicts. And secondly, it dulls the sexual side of your imagination. Instead of being able to conjure up your own fantasies in your mind, you become dependent on porn to fill with visuals, which is why it becomes addictive, similar to a drug. Ever since I quit watching porn, I do feel actually better about myself. I feel a sense of balance and purpose. And on top of that, losing interest in porn inspired me to start connecting with another girl. It turned inaction into action. It took many years for me to come to this conclusion."

Though, I know that no young person probably wants to hear that. In the moment, they believe that they're right. It's harder for them to admit to their own ignorance. I understand this all too well.
