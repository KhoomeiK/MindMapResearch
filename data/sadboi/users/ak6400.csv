BipolarReddit,ewduadz,t3_cnp4xv,1565307772.0,"Doing fairly ok these past three years. I‚Äôm almost 45, got diagnosed at 41 after a quite pronounced breakdown led to a month in the psych ward. It pretty unpleasant but I guess it was the bottoming our that allowed me to start with a clean slate and own my illness and manage it properly. I was test driving the wrong meds and self medicating on my own on and off throughout the years.


Had mixed episodes since I was 16 but never figured out what was going until way later. Tons of episodes one and off all those years...long story short it was a rough road. 

I was bit over medicated after the hospital, I was on 6...many months of just being apathetic and wanting to sleep. 

In summer 2018 I got off booze 100%. Fall 2018 I got off benzos. Spring 2019 I quit eating sugar and crappy food in general. I lost around 30lbs and I‚Äôm back into skateboarding so I can teach my sons after not being on a deck in almost 20 years. Being a parent is a big stressor for me but I‚Äôm managing. I‚Äôm more into my creative pursuits than I have been in years. Getting sober was good for that and for my sleep and many other things. My anxiety went way down after removing booze and benzos. I‚Äôve been on a lamictal/Wellbutrin combo for almost three years and that‚Äôs been the winner for me(wish I found it sooner!!).

Anyways...I can‚Äôt assume I‚Äôm in the clear forever but I‚Äôve learned to manage this illness rather well compared to the sloppy slow train wreck that took up way too many years of my life. I have to manage it for the rest of my life. For me it means creating positive feedback loops and grabbing any tools I can to be well:
Cbt, exercise, meds, skateboarding, sobriety, therapy, group therapy, having positive people around me,  music,  art and hiking etc...if negative feedback loops show up then I‚Äôm headed back to that bottom where I thought cameras in the psych ward were reading my mind so I gotta pay attention and stay fucking alert about my actions to keep it moving. People count on me and I can‚Äôt fuck around."

Also while the munchies side effect is common not everyone has the issue. And from what I‚Äôve observed with friends on different AP‚Äôs some people do better on some than others when it comes to weight...it‚Äôs all individual.

If you look up ‚ÄúwzrdryAV‚Äù on streaming services or BC I‚Äôve got some releases up. A couple of those tapes are mine in that picture and there are digital versions out. Shameless self promotion all done!"
