BPD,fkph036,t3_fgh8zj,1584409947.0,"This is relatable. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother having an FP in my life and wonder if it’s worth the ups and downs because while the ups feel A-MAZING, the downs feel like I’m having the wind knocked out of me and the rug pulled out from under me simultaneously.  I have good friends that I don’t feel a strong fear of abandonment with, and I sometimes consider just sticking with them and not allowing myself to have a favorite person. 

I thought I was making progress today but then I texted the FP and didn’t get the response I wanted...and now all the emotions are coming back and it feels like the beginning of end with this person, yet again."
BodyAcceptance,ez2zw6y,t3_cq39il,1567659835.0,"Today I thought to myself, “I wonder how much more time I could dedicate to fully living and experiencing life if I wasn’t always so busy obsessing over how I looked and what I ate?” And then my mind was blown."
