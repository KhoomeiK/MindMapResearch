BipolarReddit,eycdyd2,t3_cvrx13,1567000497.0,"Hmmm let's see, I took a citibike to the Hustler club, and would keep showing up in sweatpants to go to Sapphire, another strip club and they wouldn't let me in like that. Mind you I had never been to a strip club in my life until this point. I couldn't get jeans because there was private security guarding my apartment entrance door. I would have to call the cops every time to let me in to my place, and if I left I was effectively locked out again. The cops actually let me climb my fire escape and break into my place from the backyard (ground floor apartment) at one point. But then those fucks arrested me for 'breaking into' my spot on a separate occasion as I would hire locksmiths to let me in when the private security wasn't around. 

I met this half Japanese half Black girl at a bar right by Sapphire, macked her and brought her to a hotel, she had apparently just tried out to become a stripper, so I kinda did the captain save a hoe thing. She had a problem with her phone so got her an iphone7 to use. I then had this mission in my mind to deliver weed to a dude who worked at a Duane Reade who I saw as a Wu-Tang god, she tagged along. We stopped at a deli to pick up some stuff, but she was slow (everyone was so damn slow), so I just continued on to the spot to deliver some fire to my god. I figured she would go back to the hotel, which she had done. When I got back she was all pissed I 'ditched' her, so apparently threw the Iphone in the East river. I then had to regulate and kick the bitch out, but the manic dick is mad addictive, so she kept trying to make contact. I forgave her and we met at an Irish bar at like 3am, where I was antagonizing some people there. We went to  another hotel (I got kicked out the other spot for weed smoke). Side note, from that hotel, I could see a meeting room that had only Israeli and American flags. It looked like a conference room where govt officials probably collaborated somewhat in secret to be on the same page for UN related issues. So anyways, we get to the new hotel, everything going good, but somehow I trigger her and she starts going apeshit in the hotel room. So I go down to the lobby and pretend I am very concerned about her and that she has a history of mental illness, and that I am her boyfriend and she has acted like this before. She gets dragged away and thrown out by security. Hotel doesn't let me stay another nite so on to the next one.

So I have a neighbor I had never met who lived on the top floor, he seemed to be the only dude that was kinda cool whereas all the other folk were kinda shit scared. I considered myself root chakra on the ground floor and him as crown chakra buddha on the top. I had  a hoe over, but lost interest and wandered up to his apartment, I somehow knew intuitively which one it was. He was surprised as we had just met in the am as he came back from a night shift. He had some weed so we smoked and played chess. I had hacked chess in my mind. I let him go first, copied his every move and checkmated him. I typically don't win at chess, but my grandfather was a master, and I lost to him  99 out of a 100 times as s youth. Dude was in awe. I then went back to my apartment and gifted him some Chinese scroll that the owner had left behind when he went to live in China. We had a handshake deal, and thats how they were able to label me an illegal tenant, dude at the time didn't wanna go thru the board. Ultimately the coop brought a case against him, and he either had to sell or the apt was taken away from him (Sorry Wu!). That neighbor dude eventually ended up turning on me. I would ask him for help to get me in, ring his doorbell at odd hours. I went to ask for the manuscript back, and he didn't give it, saying he had already given it to his parents. I was already in a white people are persecuting me trip (Muslim after 9:11) but this was more typical white behavior of taking and not giving.

I have a video of me fucking with cops to let me into my apartment. My intern had an Oz of weed on him unbeknownst to me so he was shitting his pants, but I finessed those fucks into letting me into my apartment. One of them (white dude) bodychecked me on the way out (fucking pigs) and the black cop was like yall have a good day now, and I would tear into any black folk thst were supporting white behavior. I would antagonize the fuck outta the private security $15 an hour black guards by letting them know they were white fucks on the inside only wearing black skin etc."
BipolarReddit,ey7utto,t3_cvrx13,1566901620.0,"I had to go on disability and eventually leave my UN indigenous issues 'dream' job due to an episode triggered by an international flite to East Africa and back, which landed me inpatient back in 2017. It was devastating at the time, but since then I have been able to manifest other dreams into existence such as touring with a band, hanging out backstage with musicians like Robert Glasper and the Last Poets, and doing sacred ceremonies for deep healing with indigenous elders. Patience, prayer, gratitude practice, surrender, incredible family and friend support is leading me to my true desire of artistic expression.

And also, being in an Organisation like this, I can tell you that its the best thing thats happening to you. Once you see it from the inside and experience it, your dream shatters very quickly. I went through 3.5 years of a toxic office environment, got divorced and demonised, was left with only enough money to pay rent, and even though I somehow stuck it out 6 years before landing the indigenous job, it only lasted about 6 months. I was 'thriving' in the job too, being given more and more responsibilities, but the stress, weedsmoke, and travel triggered an epic episode that I hope to write into a book someday. 

Lets just say that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is G rated compared to the shit I pulled in nyc on a 2 month binge, highlights include staying at the Waldorf Astoria,  on the secret floor at the Lexington Hotel where Marilyn Monroe would stay, getting kicked out of multiple midtown hotels, opening my apt to homeless people and having the building mgmt hire security to keep me out of my own apt, getting arrested for B&E into my own apartment, a GTA charge for 'borrowing' a Citi Bike maintenance truck at 4.30am, getting attacked by some dude trying to rape me, a revolving door of prostitutes, charming women then having them rage on me, immigration jail in Cuba, finding an 'intern' and having him serve me, going to the office dressed all weird and flirting with my colleagues, going to my old office and telling the Director he should apply for an entry level position in my new office as he speaks Russian, having my mom at my place while hoes came to hang out, antagonizing peeps until they physically attack me (smashed ones head into a soda machine at a mcdonalds as he bull rushed me and grabbed his head and neck using his momentum), playing cat burglar and entering multiple buildings, partying at awesome clubs and ending up backstage with djs..."

You mention something along the lines of 'Maghrebi patterns' as if its just something people know about, the detail comes off as strange as the majority of your writing is somewhat flat/general and not very detailed.

Still waiting for that response on sexual deviance that exists in such monasteries where people attempt to suppress their natural urges and have it bubble up and out in the form of buddhist monks smoking amphetamines and diddling little boyos (a la any form of strict doctrine practice mostly made infamous by Judeo-Christianic belief systems).

As far as the response method, it is akin to an aversion of actually engaging in dialogue and putting on a front of acceptance and 'love' and 'positive vibes', hence I did not respond to it, but yes it does have a disengaging effect, sure (depending on the person). They teach this crap to professionals too, writing neutral emails etc. just sounds robotic and cliche to me. I would posit that it could vwry well further enrage someone to keep this 'I will pray for you and all beings' attitude as the undertones can be interpreted as dismissive in nature. 

I also think running away to a monastery is a form of escapism in itself. Congratulations, you absolved yourself of all the 3D world stuff that is going on by going to a place to literally sleep your life away. I have already expressed to the poster I do understand its benefits, especially if someone needs to center and balance themselves,l before returning to battle mara. I used to be enamored by the idea of these monks, but then realised that being a buddha on a mountaintop is a cop out, come be a buddha in the city and then I'll tip my hat. 

If the poster wants to hide behind a veil of I am enlightened and none of this bothers me type attitude and wants to keep reposting the same damn thing over and over again, great. I am sure I can mute them somehow. Its just not someone I believe I can learn anything from, and its akin to spam to keep seeing 3 reasons why bla bla bla in my feed.
