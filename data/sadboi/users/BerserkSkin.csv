And i haven't heard a complain from their part.
They say the only differences are in the kindness of people, street infraestructure, burocracy, and way of living. 
It depends of the city, really how good is to live in mexico. 
If your husband has a good job and you can afford to live in a well acomodated place you can do just fine.
If you guys have the normal fear of the violence, just remember that the news exploit this kind of news and forgetabout the good things.
