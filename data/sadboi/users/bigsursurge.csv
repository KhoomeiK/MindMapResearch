tiedye,fotjmkf,t3_g9gxxl,1588055958.0,"Hello! Great question!

There are many ways to get your colors to be more or less vibrant and/or saturated. Here are IMO the three most accessible and effective-

1. Use a 60/40 polycotton blend instead of a 100% cotton shirt. Polyester doesn't dye nearly as readily as cotton does so you will have a less vivid result
2. Do not treat with soda ash. the use of soda ash increases the fabrics ability to retain more color, thus making the dye more potent. 
3. Use less dye in your water/dye powder mix.

Doing any or all of these three things will make your shirts colors come out on the more pastel/muted side of the tie-dye spectrum. 

Of course, that being said, I encourage everyone to do all three of the above if you want to achieve the opposite goal of excellent saturation and vivid colors. 

Much love and happy dyeing!!"

AskMen,fauml8z,t3_eajcxk,1576349677.0,"There are quite a few moments in my life that fit the bill, but I think the one that affected me the most was when my dad told me that he was getting back together with my stepmom for the 23rd time. (No exaggeration, I kept count)

They had had an explosive on again-off again relationship. My dad got with this woman about two weeks after my parents told me they were getting divorced. Things were actually pretty good for about a year, and then my stepmom and her insane adopted granddaughter moved in with us in my old home. The facade immediately came down, and it turned out she was a level 5 batshit crazy person with a drug problem. She was incredible at manipulating my dad, and I know that he truly regrets giving her so many chances. 

The reason the 23rd time in particular was so awful, was because we had literally moved to a different county to get away from them. My life had been completely uprooted, I was at a new school that i hated, with no friends or stability in my life and it was all because we needed to get away from these people. After a couple months, things had gotten so much better, and I was truly starting to love our new house, and I had even made some new friends. Then one day, my dad sat me down and told me that him and Trish had been talking and she was going to be moving in with us again. Not only did it break my heart, it broke me mentally and destroyed any trust I had left in my dad. 

This wasnt even the last time this scenario happened, but from that moment on, I just expected it. I knew that they weren't going to stay broken up. 

Life is so much better now. My dad finally left her entirely and even though he definitely broke our relationship down I'm very proud of him for eventually getting it right. 

Much love everyone!"

As of the beginning of last year, I was living out of the back of my truck. It was a relatively easy transition for me, but it is not to be taken lightly, and I am very grateful to have my own place now. Here are a few tips:

Find 3 seperate options where you can park overnight. For me it was in front of my family's house on the street, near my friends house off of a cul de sac, and a truck stop near my work that had showers and overnight parking. 

Next, you need to figure out your bathroom situation. What are you going to do when everything around you is closed, but you're in too much of a public space to utilize the great outdoors? 24 hour spots like walmart, or a 24 hour gym will be very useful to you for this. This also goes for showering, I would invest into a subscription to a gym in order to shower. 

Look into the laws surrounding sleeping in your vehicle where you live, and where you are planning to go. Do not, for instance, sleep in your car within 1,000 feet of a school. Not a good idea. 

Have a plan for how you're going to bathe and feed yourself, and prepare a decent sleeping area in your automobile. Sleep is so important for you to succeed in this environment. 

I lived in my truck for half a year in California. I'm currently in Austin, Texas and it is so much cheaper and easier to get by here.

Hope everything works out for you and you can use some of these tips"

For me, I think the main issue is that I am obsessed with music. When there is music on around me, I am paying attention to it. I'm listening intently to the rhythm and I am also analyzing the song structure. I personally don't like to listen to music when I'm in the outdoors participating in one of these events. I'm out there to experience the outdoors, not someone else's playlist. That being said, and like I said in my post, I'm not in favor of a ban, and I think that people should do what they're going to do, I would just ask that people be considerate, and also understand that some other people on the course are going to resent it. If you're ok with that, that's your prerogative!
