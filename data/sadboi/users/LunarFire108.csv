I'm not bringing up the ""Hey people have it worse than you"" argument at all.

I'm sure OP did not mean it in that way but I've seen multiple posts on here of people wishing that. Just because your drowning in misery and feel like an outcast doesn't mean you should bring people down to your level. Some people have things they want to do before they die unlike you all who are wishing death would speed it up.

My advice, get used to the combat cause you can't always rely on your pawns to save the day. If you want to stay away from enemies, I recommend getting the mystic knight vocation and leveling it up to at least 5 to get magick cannon which can be OP asf.

I was talking to my Korean friend on his livestream when this girl came in and constantly called him Oppa(Korean word for older brother) I'm ok when its once since I used to be into Kpop and it was common to see fans use it but she used it in every sentence she typed. That's when I got a bit annoyed at seeing the word constantly in non Korean letters. I told her to stop and just call him by his name but and was like ""oh why cant I call him oppa??"" My reasoning is that she was not Korean and she wasn't writing it in the correct format or Korean letters. She just kept whining about how she wanted to call him oppa and I just gave up.

AskReddit,fejfpu9,t3_ep9ur1,1579172018.0,"First one is a video someone shared over a group chat of a Chinese man beating a dog and crushing its skull until blood started coming out of its nose. I couldn't even finish it and immediately hid in the comments. The person who shared it was talking about ""oh well not many people know Chinese eat dogs""

Second is of a rape victim in Indonesia or Philippines I think who had her whole face torn off. It was just a picture of her laying there with a bloodied skull face and exposed bottom(since she was sexually assaulted). It shocked me for sure but not as bad as the first one."

Thank God my mom let me get instructed by her friend rather than it being her because knowing how she is, I make one little mistake and she flips. Or she would just rage quit and say ""Oh just let me do it!"" Her friend was understanding and patient with me."
