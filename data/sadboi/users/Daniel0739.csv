c) I don’t care that much about N counts really, but I guess that’s just me, anyone is free to date any person under whatever criteria they set.

Still, the chance of one really dating a hooker out of genuine love are infinitely small, less than that of being struck by lighting or winning the lottery, I guess.

Cringetopia,flkzj12,t1_fljxgpp,1585250730.0,"Well, let me put a Colombian perspective to this “personal defense” issue, here almost no one is allowed to own a gun, except for rich and threatened people, and criminals of course who can get guns easily and relatively cheap from the black markets all around the country, so an armed robber can easily break into your home or mug you on the street (which is very common over here) and when you’re the one who’s being robbed and your family is being put at risk you are not allowed to defend yourself.

You’re supposed to call the police and hide, and wait for them... 45 or more minutes since their response time is absolutely terrible, and even then they send a payroll car with two fat and undertrained juniors that barely know what to do and don’t give a single damn about what’s going on, in this situation, and living in this country ownership of a gun is a god send, stabbing a robbing rat inside your home can give you jail time, so you might as well shoot him and make sure he’s dead.

So many people in high risk areas and high risk jobs also get guns from the black markets and simply hid them well until the day they might need it, they also use legal loopholes to get permits or to buy potentially lethal weapons that are not including under the restrictions for ownership, and that way many families can sleep easy at night even in places like “Distrito de agua blanca” in Cali or “Siloé” also in Cali, or places like  “Comuna 13” in Medellín, and don’t get me started on Bogotá’s Bronx.

Edit: my dad owned a gun, with permit (because he was once kidnapped and held hostage by the FARC) he always took it with him everywhere he went, he never meant to kill someone with it and he always told me that if a situation called for it he’d try to use it only for dissuasion.

Another edit: Colombia is a country with a history full of rebellions, revolutions and civil wars, until the early 20th century everybody was able to own guns and there was no regulation, then a conservative authoritative government took power (by staging a successful rebellion and cue) and they set laws to heavily restrict ownership, after that the number of rebellions per decade decreased significantly, but the tyranny of the government has always been a constant in our history, be it a conservative or liberal government.

Just look at Alvaro Uribe for an example of that in recent history."

As a voter (of a country that’s not the US) I vote for politicians that favor my personal interests and whose policies are likely to benefit me economically, socially, or in whatever other way, so in order to make the right vote you gotta filter out all the bullshit said in campaign debates, interviews and slogans and think more pragmatically about what this person you’re voting for will be doing once he’s in power, not only according to their (80% of the time empty) promises but also according to the pressure from his party, Cabinet, already existing policies, market, and most important, what will cause him to be re-elected.
