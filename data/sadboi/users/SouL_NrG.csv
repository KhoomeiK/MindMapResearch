Anxiety,exs2aow,t3_cu2roa,1566530248.0,"I feel your pain my friend. Certain times of the year (not recently) I would wake up with massive headaches/tension headaches. I was scared to go to sleep and have to wake up the next morning. I had blood work done, nothing, ct scan, also nothing. I researched and found out that if I snore a lot, that can cause morning headaches due to sleep apnea and lack of oxygen to my brain. I started using a mouth guard at night, big improvement. In addition to this I also started drinking lots of water every day, all week. Very disciplined. I went and got a hard core, legitimate deep tissue upper body massage. Amazing. I started taking magnesium tablets daily. Fast forward 4-5 months and I have not woken up with massive headaches. It also helps to think to your self that you are strong and nothing is wrong with you. You have to genuinely believe that. Through out the day take moments to take in deep breathes, feel the breathing and concentrate in that moment, nothing else. Best of luck."

Anxiety,evoun6k,t3_ced3nz,1564658424.0,"Anxiety took over my life since 2007.
Ive gotten better and better slowly, however, I'm unable to travel, especially by plane due to the worry, anxiety and panic. It's seems impossible to me.
Thank you for your victorious story and accomplishment. It gives me power and hope."
Anxietyhelp,evckhos,t3_cild0d,1564417269.0,"It's mostly general thinking. I try to avoid the worse case scenario. For example, I'm afraid to travel far, by plane because I instantly feel and think that a panic attack will occur. I have gotten better over time, but the feeling and thought still linger. I'm getting better at it."
Anxietyhelp,evcjhiz,t3_cild0d,1564416626.0,"Lately it's been worse. I worry more and feel more worried. I think about the future, instant negative thoughts kick in and I feel this worry and fear. Usually I get a feeling in my stomach and that worsens it too."
