AskPsychiatry,fqzqkob,t1_fqxveex,1589773056.0,Thanks. I'm going to stay on 1200mg for a couple weeks before I go down again.
antidepressants,fqxd9lo,t3_glflmo,1589730352.0,If your brain is used used to having the chemicals consistently at the same time and all of a sudden that's not happening it could be some withdrawal symptoms. Paxil has really bad withdrawal so it is best you take it consistently and at the same time. It should clear up soon though.
AskPsychiatry,fquctxm,t1_fqtru43,1589656497.0,From what I've read though it does seem to be more dependent on calories? I read something when I first started taking it that absorption rate can go down to 25% and below if you don't eat enough. Its really confusing. Im not sure if that doctor just said it has to be 500 calories as a way to force me to eat that much...and my pdoc followed along...
AskPsychiatry,fquc85g,t1_fqubjcb,1589656153.0,"Are you a doctor? What will I expect from withdrawal?

Edit: I see from your profile that you aren't a doctor and it sounds like you've had a bad experience with gabapentin. I didn't have any issues except I gained a tolerance. I used to only take it 3x a week with good results but my doctor insisted I take it 2-3x daily. So I'm not really that worried about withdrawal but would like to know what to expect.

Also if you're not a doctor it's a good idea to start your post with NAD so you're not confusing people with potentially incorrect/harmful info."
AskPsychiatry,fqted6p,t3_gkkpl7,1589637281.0,"NAD but this reminded me of something that happened to another patient when I was hospitalized last year. Basically she kept screaming ""they're telling me they're (the meds) poison! They can be trusted you are trying to poison me"" or something to that effect. Finally they got her to believe they were vitamins by ""speaking"" to her hallucinations who said they wanted to go on vacation or something. I thought it was pretty unethical."

AskPsychiatry,fqtdkid,t1_fqt6oqz,1589636767.0,"I have a dietician through PHP. She modified my meal plan going off what my prescription says so that I am eating 500 calories at dinner and then take my pills. However I would throw up my pills 3 out of 5 times probably.  So I started taking it at afternoon snack but thats less than 200 calories. The hope is that if I do throw up after dinner the pills would be dissolved. But before I started PHP I would eat 3-400 calories in one meal a day and take it at that time. If I ate more than that I would purge, and usually I already took my pills by then. That would happen 1-2x a week. I had conversations with my doctor and we both agreed I just wasn't eating enough for it to absorb. So its confusing that this new doctor says I am it just isn't working. I'm also probably on too low of a dosage (60mg) but he had to adjust the dosages on pretty much all my meds at once and wanted to see if I would get more of an effect from higher dosage of lamictal first. anyway, I am starting to doubt my doctor because this one is being much more aggressive with my medications to get me on therapeutic dosages. Before PHP I had been stuck on the same dosages since November and nothing was working.  Yet her only solution was to add on zyprexa and Depakote to try to make me rapidly gain weight which just made things worse."
AskPsychiatry,fqrzwyl,t1_fqq0u3i,1589595489.0,Oh I see. I wonder if this was more the reason because I do have an eating disorder which puts me at risk of issues from purging.
AskPsychiatry,fqrztmp,t1_fqnt3hu,1589595433.0,"Well the geodon was prescribed for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. It has no effect on any of those things.
When I was on zyprexa however, the first month I saw a drastic improvement in all of those areas. But then the binging/purging/weight gain kicked in and I spiraled out of control over the next 4 months. I begged and begged to be taken off of it and finally she agreed and gave me geodon."

AskPsychiatry,fqn2cw4,t1_fqmq59i,1589487501.0,"Oh okay. I would have thought the risk was greater because zyprexa seems to be a much stronger med with more side effects...  I'm 29f, anorexia, depression, anxiety, insomnia, ptsd, bpd. I'm also taking lamictal 150mg, gabapentin 1800mg, atarax 200mg and lunesta 2mg.  I don't have any side effects from the geodon... it doesn't seem to be doing anything at this dose. However, before I was not eating 500 calories with it and often would eat nothing so absorption was low. I've been eating 500 calories with it for one month since I started ED PHP but still no effects. The reglan would have been to speed up my gastric emptying and alleviate my GI issues from being forced to eat all the time."

TalkTherapy,fpj92ld,t1_fpj40oh,1588660330.0,"Thank you. When my psychiatrist referred me to residential it went through the regional ED committee but the committee is just a bunch of therapists, not anyone on the insurance side. They denied me for PHP originally (only approved IOP) as well but approved it after the treatment center sent them my intake notes. Which was funny to me because when I asked why they didn't approve residential I was told ""they used their extensive expertise to review your chart and decided IOP is the best fit."" My dietitian  said she asked my psychiatrist to try again with res.  I'm not sure if she is the right person to do it or if I need to, or maybe the CEO of the treatment center? But because of the meltdown I had with the therapist on Friday my psychiatrist did say she is discussing my modifying my treatment plan with the team there, so hopefully I will be able to see a therapist. Because I really need all the support I can get. The program in all honesty is only making my mental health worse. And the gastroparesis doesn't help make me want to eat lol.

How long were you inpatient for? I would definitely be willing to go to Pasadena if it's Kaiser contracted. I'm also not finding any inpatient eating disorder units in NorCal. I only found one at Stanford for adolescents. That type of atmosphere sounds like it could really help me though. And having 24/7 support is something I really need right now. But I can't leave my dog for an extended period of time. At the res here I would be able to bring her."
AskPsychiatry,fpgkzwq,t3_gdcpi8,1588604751.0,"Eating disorders are something that are best treated with therapy and he probably knows that.

I had BED most my life (anorexia now) and wasn't ever even diagnosed by any psychiatrists. It was just ignored despite me at one point having a BMI over 50. It's better for him to be honest with you. But he should refer you to someone who does have the expertise to treat you. That would have been the ethical thing to do. My psychiatrist does not have the expertise to deal with EDs but she still tries and it made things worse for me. She had me on zyprexa which caused my bulimia to come back and I gained 50lbs in 4mos. I begged and begged for her to take me off it and finally she put me on geodon, lamictal, and lunesta.

My insurance has an ED committee that makes referring decisions so my psychiatrist request they meet and approve me for treatment. It did take time for me to get into the program, my psychiatrist sent the request probably 5 months ago. I did my intakes over zoom.  The first half where we have 2 groups and lunch is in person (but capped at 4 clients, with 2 therapists and a dietician) and the second half which has my group plus everyone doing EDIOP is virtual. So basically you have to eat dinner on camera and log it in recovery record. They provide ensures since I'm doing the first half, other clients would buy their own if they need them. But not sure what would happen if I just refused to eat during dinner? Would they boot me from zoom? Idk.  If I was just doing the EDIOP portion the dietitian said she would have to figure out weigh ins so they are blind but couldn't control me weighing myself otherwise.

VPN,fndyurf,t1_fncz7nv,1586880026.0,Probably a suspicious IP with multiple password fails
bipolar,fncb8q4,t1_fnc9ykm,1586832649.0,Oh well that makes me more confused and I wonder if she's just dismissing my PTSD...
TalkTherapy,fnc92xf,t1_fnc3oxj,1586831271.0,Thank you. I am trying to process but sometimes I don't even feel like I can go on. She was my only support and now I'm just alone. I will keep trying though. I call the crisis line through my insurance when I start wanting to kill myself and I can get out of it. I have to tell myself the feelings will pass...
bipolar,fnc8hjc,t1_fnc5i2g,1586830898.0,Thank you! This makes a lot more sense now. I scored a 42 on the test so I guess. What I need  I  think is clarity from my psychiatrist though is the PTSD piece. How they overlap.
antidepressants,fnc3izd,t3_g0vxii,1586827855.0,It's not really an activating AD...When I was on it I took it at night.
antidepressants,fnc24fu,t3_g0sd7d,1586827017.0,"Very difficult to get off venlafaxine. You'll likely find that even after one day you have severe withdrawal symptoms. So definitely consider tapering it slowly. Are you able to request that your doctor call you? They can't just not be working, and if they aren't they would have a covering physician."
VPN,fnbynuo,t3_g0sfdn,1586824963.0,I don't think they detect VPNs as I've used it with one in China and didn't get a suspicious login attempt email. Never gotten one when logging in overseas either. Maybe the person tried to log in too many times?
kratom,fnbwrtj,t3_g0m2et,1586823867.0,I hate the AKA tbh.
OCD,fnbncc8,t3_g0khdz,1586818613.0,I think this is really awesome!
theGoldenGirls,fnblj8n,t3_g0o7t5,1586817676.0,My boss sent me the hoodie a couple days ago. Too bad she didn't also send me money to buy it because she doesn't pay me enough to be able to afford it lmao.
tacobell,fnaxy4l,t3_g0klw2,1586805783.0,"I've never tried it but one time I tried to order it after googling ""does taco bell have enchiladas"" and was very disappointed. At the very least they could bring back olives..."
AskPsychiatry,fnaxa5q,t1_fnatgsj,1586805449.0,"Oh I see. I've been thinking about it and  I do have some traits. But I am diagnosed with PTSD and most of my symptoms (irritability, agitation, self harm, impulsivity, etc) are attributed to that... However I think it also concerns her that I send her messages sometimes daily usually in the middle of the night about various things that don't really make any sense. For example the reason she said this is because I messaged her that the depakote was poisoning me and I wasn't going to continue taking it even if I got withdrawal. So it somewhat makes sense."

EatingDisorders,fnaqujc,t1_fn8fggd,1586802214.0,"Thank you for the guidance. I'm actually not sure now that PHP will be approved by my insurance. The ED committee has to meet again to decide and if they approve and if they do my psychiatrist has to send insurance an outside referral request.  It's more complicated than the ED clinic thought...they told me I would be able to start on the 20th but I don't think that will be the case after I got info from my therapist. If it is approved I think I would need to file for disability, because working a reduced schedule at my full time job I would lose more money than going on leave...And thinking about it I don't know how they would be able to fire me when I get back because that would be grounds for a lawsuit. If they fire me now there's nothing I can do because I haven't disclosed disability and this is an at will employment state. 

When I posted before a lot of people told me EDIOP was a ""step down"" program and not for first time treatment, so I was not optimistic about it anyway...I had originally hoped they would approve me for residential so I had no choice but to stop everything and focus on getting better. And I tried to appeal their decision but they said EDIOP was my only option, so now I'm not so sure the committee will even approve it like I thought..."
AskPsychiatry,fnalk2s,t3_g0dwd6,1586799593.0,"I've never been asked if I masturbate but almost every time I do an intake with a new MH provider they ask my sexuality and if I'm (and have ever been) sexually active. Not 100% sure why, but the sexuality one may be for patient statistics and the other because it can help figure out your diagnosis..."
mentalhealth,fnalceb,t1_fn9oe8j,1586799488.0,"That is a really good idea, I will try it with cleaning, because I struggle with that a lot.."
mentalhealth,fn83u2o,t3_g01kpw,1586733321.0,My mental health has gotten no better/worse since the quarantine. I only left the house to go to work anyway. And usually I would just sit in my car all day because I'm too depressed to do anything else.
Cruise,fn7k0s5,t1_fn7euih,1586721867.0,Neither are likely to happen before next year.
CPTSD,fn71ykq,t1_fn71h9e,1586711723.0,Yeah I've sent my pdoc numerous messages about it and she usually doesn't respond. I'm not sure she reads my message if it's more than two sentences honestly. But I message her sometimes daily so I can understand.

StackAdvice,fn6t0mi,t1_fn69qt8,1586706759.0,"I'm looking into CBD, maybe that will help. Water fasting just encourages disordered eating behaviors though. I would know, I have anorexia lol."
CPTSD,fn6p88e,t1_fn5mmkw,1586704537.0,"My insurance denied my request to switch and my psychiatrist told me I had to keep working with her to get treatment, the situation is kind of ridiculous really. I'm going to submit a grievance to my insurance company and see what happens because I feel worse and worse every time I talk to her."
CPTSD,fn6p0si,t1_fn662n9,1586704413.0,"Yeah I think she hasn't done any trauma informed care training. She said its not good to dwell on what happened by writing it down, it will only be a reminder.  She says I need to focus on the present and the past is behind me. When I tell her Im not safe she just says yes you are until I agree. She does this a lot where she repeats things until I just agree with them. I actually didnt do therapy for 6 months after my therapist of 2 years left my clinic and felt better than I do now. I've thought about it and I'm going to submit a grievance to my insurance company that I'm being denied appropriate care not being allowed to transfer to someone trained in working with my issues."
