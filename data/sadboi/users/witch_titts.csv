depression,fnr1px8,t3_g36yxc,1587177197.0,I completely understand. Totally dismisses the pain now. And if you arent allowed to acknowledge the feelings in the moment properly because everything is dismissed by an ‘obvious easy’ solution or ‘it gets better’ it won’t. Talking should leave you feeling lighter but if everything said is met with that it makes you feel like even more of a burden. They think they are helping but it’s not a helpful approach. You can’t come up with a solution to get better or wait it out if you haven’t even been able to process your emotions. People just need to be able to confide in someone and vent otherwise the thoughts just continue to ruminate. Its hard to come across someone who is good at listening and comforting. I literally have no one I can dump all the nonsense in mind out with and just talk so I write / journal whatever. Might help for you.  I hope you find peace. just wanted to say I know exactly what ur saying and I know a lot of others feel the same 💗

mentalillness,fnmymz6,t3_g273ym,1587080742.0,"Your life starts with your body and yes this behavior is going to affect everything in your life. I was a college dropout as my bulimia hit me pretty hard once I graduated high school. I didn’t tell anyone and isolated myself and so it continued for longer than necessary and the people who could’ve helped me and would have understood weren’t able to. I lost my education, opportunities, and a lot of relationships to my ED. And you don’t wanna wait till that point or you’re dead to let the people you care about know you’re struggling. So try to resist isolating yourself and surrendering your life to this illness. It will lie and try to take everything from you. I had my ED for probably 6 years and though I struggle with other issues today, I always remind myself how grateful I am to not have that anymore. It is truly one if not the most terrible things I’ve had to endure in my life and I can’t believe I get to sit here today and look back on it and be able to say that I’ve never been more comfortable in my skin. Idk if this was helpful I just can relate and want you to know you’re not alone, you are more so much more than your body and image, and life can and will get better and I really wish that for you 💗💗💗💗💗"
mentalillness,fnmwj3u,t3_g2aqj9,1587079533.0,I’m sorry you feel this way! I understand. And not to ask stupid questions but are you on medication for anything or seeing a therapist or psychiatrist about this? Sounds like you could benefit from some sort of mood stabilizer.
mentalillness,fnmw0ub,t3_g2acwd,1587079250.0,I think you can do online counseling too? Which may suffice for the time being until you figure out all your other options. Maybe you could talk to your dad separately and tell him you feel you really need this. Wishing you the best hope you can find some help 💗
mentalillness,fnmvmay,t3_g2d5r2,1587079024.0,"I know what you mean how you feel it’s hard to inspire hope thinking that even if my brain did somehow work correctly the circumstances of life are and always will most likely be tolling on your mental well being. I think over time we can learn to adapt and be better at handling everything than we can imagine now. You never know what life has in store so I guess we just have to try and stick around to find out. Sorry you are suffering so, I understand ❤️"
abuse,fnmtl8n,t3_g0xhyt,1587077910.0,No need to try and understand but you do need to do something about it. A 3 yo cannot help themselves and I’m sorry but if you really believe in God he’s gonna put your ass in hell if you just ignore the well being of a helpless child when you had the opportunity to do something

AgeGap,fngof6y,t3_g1m6pn,1586939047.0,He’s definitely in the wrong and he will probably come crawling back eventually but don’t give in! Been in a similar situation. If men are using you for one thing make sure you’re using them for something too! They will continue to disappoint throughout life but again I’m sorry you had to go through this he is a piece of shit and will get his karma. It’s not your fault you didn’t know better and he knew that.
AgeGap,fngo4u0,t3_g1m6pn,1586938752.0,I’m sorry bb :( he shouldn’t have taken advantage of you like that men r scum

Hyperhidrosis,fnfo9im,t3_g1h4gi,1586912042.0,"I’ve heard you can get Botox injections in the places where you are sweating but there’s the possibility it would just make it worse in other areas. But if you’re hands and feet don’t sweat that much it might be an option for you. Also talk to a doctor about medication that may help. I’ve been meaning to do that myself. Maybe try to remember to breathe deeply because I feel like nerves do trigger the perspiration even more and just thinking about it alone makes it worse so I try to be mindful of that, even though i know it’s really hard to ignore. 
When I was in middle school I had excessive underarm perspiration and used prescription strength deodorants and they didn’t really help. I don’t sweat under my arms now nearly as much as I did then so there’s a possibility it may go away over time. Though it could have been worse at that time for me due to the nerves from being in the hell that is middle school but again there is the possibility of it going away on its own eventually."
techsupport,fnf5eko,t1_fnf2ugd,1586901721.0,"It’s not going to work again until I find out what to do from here ? Lol I am simply asking if anyone knows what I should do. Everything just says ‘back up ur information’ but I cant! I can’t access the drive, I can’t access my settings because what- the computer doesn’t work and the screen says error 301- back up info immediately- run diagnostic test- or continue to start up. So I am just asking since there is no information on how to back up my info without accessing the drive itself should I run the diagnostic test OR continue to start up and is there a possibility I will lose all my files if I chose one of those because those are my only options it seems."
techsupport,fnez182,t1_fncmyaj,1586898449.0,Yes everything says to replace the drive but that’s what I’m saying idk how because it’s inaccessible

ADHD,fl1t675,t1_fl1s2lo,1584735772.0,yea breathing deeply seems to help release the tension a lot I just need to train myself to do it all the time and hopefully I’ll adjust to the feeling. thanks for your input!

depression,ffdkk21,t1_ffdipbi,1579822837.0,Aw it’s ok bb 💔 I understand the guilt you’re feeling about wishing you had spent more time but I’m sure you had a lot together overall and he is now at peace and knows that you loved him well! And at least you were with him in his very last moments to say goodbye ❤️ seems like he was well taken care of (•: it will hurt for now but allow yourself to grieve just don’t let your pain overstay and forgive yourself!
depression,ffdjkr5,t3_esxeki,1579822238.0,Hope you are ok now nothing lasts forever so however you’re feeling will pass. Please don’t make a permanent mistake over a temporary feeling! People tend to be much stronger than they realize. I know you can pull yourself out of this place right now. It’s just a bump in your road. Sending you my love 💓💓💓
Herpes,f98rja9,t3_e49kwy,1575181962.0,"I am no expert and just recently found out about my hsv2 status but before I knew, I had sex with two different partners both without a condom multiple times and did not transfer to them. I also get my break out right at the opening of my vagina so they were definitely exposed to the area though I wasn’t having symptoms like yourself. So I think it would be unlikely though there is a small chance of transfer but the only way to know for sure is just for her to get tested. Hope this helped a little."
