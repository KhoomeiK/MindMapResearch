I'd append that the procedure itself is often tantamount to torture. People are subjected to what is essentially intense psychological abuse packaged as ""aversion therapy"".  The combination of this and the fact that it doesn't work anyway, leads people to feel a sense of complete failure and despair, and many people sadly end up taking their own lives as a result.

There are also serious questions about consent.  Ethically, doctors and therapists have to stick to a principle of *informed* consent for medical procedures. The people who push these therapies lie to their victims, saying things like ""you'll never find love in a same sex relationship, you'll never be happy"" etc.  And many of these people come from very conservative backgrounds in which they have already been indoctrinated with loads of patently false views about LGBT people.  I'd argue that informed consent is pretty much impossible to give in these cases, even if people *think* they might want to undergo it, that is because they have been lied to by people they trust."

I have no doubt that there were conversations about the optics of how this would look in terms of race, but fear of racism was absolutely not the driving factor of the cover up.

They have gone with this excuse because it makes them look less terrible than the truth and absolves them of personal blame. The British tabloid media has enthusiastically taken it up because it 1.

The UK is clearly a much more enthusiastic contributor to international aid than Canada is, and Canada still has huge unaddressed problems such as the crimes of its enormous mining and fossil fuels conglomerates.

In my view, what you're left with is a messy situation where it really isn't fair to say one is worse than the other.

Collectively, the west needs to do far more to make amends for colonialism, and to work to protect the self determination of threatened nations such as Taiwan.  I don't see the UK as being particularly worse than any other former colonial power so I took issue with singling it out as a nation Canada shouldn't deal with for this reason.

I am absolutely in favour of Western countries doing far more to make up for their colonial past (although government apologies without action are pretty meaningless), but it is factually untrue that the UK has never made any effort to apologise or make amends. 

It's also important to ask what making amends would look like, e.g. would it take the form of international aid? Because the UK is the [largest](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/04/uk-among-six-countries-hit-un-aid-spending-target-oecd) international aid donor of any major economy (% GDP), notably far higher than Canada and one of only 6 countries in the world to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GDP.

Different countries all limit speech in different ways, but that's a separate debate. My point is not that it's acceptable to limit speech, it's that advertising and political donations do not count as speech.

Aside from the legal argument, I would argue that the people of the US are *functionally* significantly less free to speak than most Western democracies.  For example, when your family's healthcare is coupled to your employment, you have a much greater incentive to keep your mouth shut about how your boss mistreats you.  Or if you're a black man in a conservative state for example, and a cop arrests you arbitrarily for ""resisting arrest"" because you said something to them that they didn't like.  These are examples of how *practical* freedom of speech is restricted every day, despite the existence of the first amendment.  

The American conception of free speech and freedom is in my view, overly simplistic.  Other Western nations seem to focus significantly more on the ability to live freely in daily life, rather than some theoretical idea of freedom guaranteed by a supreme Court most people have zero access to."

ukpolitics,fo7j27p,t1_fo7gdbt,1587579179.0,"My worry with this is that Germany is far more balanced than the UK in terms of regional wealth and population distribution. At least with hospitals directly controlled its easier to ensure care is provided in places where it may not be as profitable to do so.

We have a responsibility to support their decision, *especially* as former colonial powers.  You dont begin making amends for colonialism by letting the Chinese practice colonialism, you make amends by protecting the right of peoples to their own self determination.  90% of Taiwan born people want to remain Taiwanese and that should be the end of it. 

The Chinese government is behaving like an imperial power and should be called out for it."

They're not setting out *to* kill them, but it wouldn't exactly count as accidental either."
