AskReddit,fd3iw1s,t1_fd3iorc,1578158751.0,I’m thinking along the lines of: what about the world leaders? What if a bunch of them had a bad trip? What if they had the stereotypical LSD revelation?

tipofmytongue,fc9vvnf,t1_fc9v8a0,1577558969.0,The similarities between my description and this song are eerily similar but it’s not it.
tipofmytongue,fc9j56y,t3_egt9tu,1577553426.0,I’ll try to listen harder next time but I’m desperately hoping you sleuths could help me out

If your name is uncommon, then obviously with the increased amount of times you have been to the gyno, she’d notice. Like with Siobhan. For the longest time I didn’t know how to pronounce it, but once I made the connection to the spelling and pronunciation, I didn’t make the mistake again. It’s really that simple. She doesn’t give a fuck. Countless patients or not. A few corrections should be all that’s needed. Her dismissing it and saying that you have to deal with it is extremely insensitive. 

But you didn’t have to tell her to fuck off. Many other words could’ve been used. “I’d appreciate if you attempted to try.” “I’ve told you numerous times how to pronounce it and I find it offensive that you don’t seem to care.” Etc..."

college,ev3oizy,t1_ev1vf9x,1564198637.0,My credit is 630 and I’ve had credit for like 1.5 years and that wasn’t enough for Sallie. I heard that Upstart and Discover is good for shit credit but you get abysmal interest rates. I havent tried them yet
college,ev1u7bm,t3_ci60ct,1564165219.0,Sallie Mae is pretty nice if you have a cosigner. Neither of you have to have stellar credit from what I’ve heard.

He expressed that he was into it and I told him I’d be okay with helping him explore it a little bit. We’re definitely not restricting sexual play to online bulls. It’s just a side thing. We have sex, I play online a little bit, he gets horny thinking about it, I tease him, we have sex again. 

Don’t worry :) I appreciate the advice though!"
