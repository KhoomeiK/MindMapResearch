Clinique brand of products is the only make-up I used for 20 years, they're a reliable brand for me. Due to sensitivity changes from skin dryness, I've switched to baby oil gel and lavender oil to moisturize the skin on my body. Any time my clothes are washed in a machine where trace amounts of different detergents can mingle with my clothes, if I don't add a cup of white vinegar to strip out oils I will get hives when I wear these clothes.

My logic behind this is maybe if they begin to associate positive attention when everyone is together, maybe they won't be as competitive with each other.

Another thing you can try is a kitty condo strategically placed so there's a high ground alternative escape route across the furniture and a hiding place up off the floor that feels safe to them. If you haven't already, each cat really needs their own litter box + 1 extra litter box. 

I think you had a brilliant idea by distracting them with play. They can't use their extra energy to fight each other if they're too engaged (and pooped out) by play üòÅ Maybe also try a click/play/treats & loves combo.
