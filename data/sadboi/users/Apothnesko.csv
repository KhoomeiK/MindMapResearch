I don't know who i am and i don't know what i want to do, if i try something and i fuck up, my whole life would be ruined.

I feel shitty because my peers are doing so much more than me on mommy and daddies money, while I'm fighting to make sure i have food and a roof. And i don't even have anyone to tell about everything. I'm just too depressing to fix or be around, just too far gone. I'm just constantly ridiculed by peers and those who don't know me.

I feel constricted. I have to work 40 hours a week to be able to try and do something i might want to do, and then probably not even have time for it. I'm stuck in a fucking loop. i hate that the world thinks we need to be ground to be bone to be successful.

Ask, ""what do i need to do to stop the curve from progressing."", ""what can i do for pain management"", etc.

There's going to be many stretches/exercises that physical therapy will give you to continue doing to help your spine.

Your spine is very important it is best to seek out as much professional medical advice as you can while you go through this, they will be able to tell you what's best and what you need to do.
