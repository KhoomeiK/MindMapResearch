He could be making a horrible mistake that he will likely regret if it happens. I made such a regret a a young age.  I wish I could change it still.  After seeing my wife with someone else, it changed that cuckold spirit I had but it was too late by then.  I wish I had another chance.  I think letting him see another guy value u and you going with him would make him fight for u but I could be wrong.... just don't cheat on him,  and be prepared to start fresh with ur hubby.  Being young makes us stupid.  After 30 all that changed and I was sure I made the biggest mistake of my life leaving my wife"

FreeCompliments,flcojuo,t3_fnx3af,1585039565.0,"Start today doing planks for abs. Work your way up to planking for 7minutes, if u need to do them in intervals then 30 second intervals till u reach 7 min for the day. No rest days, only when your body absolutely needs it because your a hard gainer with a strong metabolism which means you recover in hours.  U will see abs popping out immediately after the first day.   Eat high carb diet after workout but not overly excessive,  just a good weight gaining portion.  You quick body will use all the notes n pump them to the muscles that were getting the most bloodflow.   Its all about blood flow.  U want big,  u need notes going to the desired place, so u need to make sure to get that flow pumping until the muscle group is swole.  That's not enough,  it needs to become tight from swoleness. Repeat muscle groups day after day to keep blood going there, as long as they are swole then nutes are going there when you eat.  Become aware of this blood swoleness thing in ur body.  Next u need to understand that the muscles in order to get bigger, they need to break the connective tissue...the sinews run in a straight line but they are held in a straight bunch by the connective tissue which is like a web or grid.  The blood needs to expand the straight tissue so much that the connective ""grid like"" tissue breaks.  Only then will it allow for bigger muscles.  This is why rest periods between sets should only be for 10sec, because as soon as tension is released blood goes everywhere else where its easier to go.  You want to pump them to the point of connective ""grid"" tissue breakage quickly and efficiently.  So no rest periods between sets longer than 15sec max.  U want to pump pump pump and break that connective tissue without allowing the blood free to go anywhere else in as short a time possible otherwise its counter productive to mass gaining.

Now for the upper body, shoulders... lateral raises and full arnolds.  Biceps, curls and close grip pullups, triceps-kickbacks and extensions. 

Key takeaway, it's not a numbers game of reps or sets,  the focus is blood, blood expands tissue to the breaking point of connective tissue and it keeps nutes in that zone that its pumped to.
Know ur body and when its swole and when its starting to deflate, typically deflates in a day or two if done right.
Btw, your sexy baby"

Your not done, your life  is full of purpose that this setback is preparing you for.  The pain that you have is incredible and powerful but it is not going to overcome you.  Your victorious but in this dark place it's hard to see any glimmer of light that is there.  I know though that your going to become a warrior that is able to endure and persevere through even the most severe of circumstances.  Each new day brings new challenges and can even have more pain but your purpose is not to endure suffering forever.  Your experiences make you more experienced and when you are again in a place of peace and tranquility you will possess what it takes to be able to help others that are in similar situations.  If your reading these words its because your a champion that has yet to conquer this giant, but I know that you will conquer it because these words were prepared for you but given to me to give to you.  This battle ends with you being victorious.  Your not done yet, the light will yet again glint from your eyes and your smile will return to you yet.  Your life is more important than you or I could even comprehend, but losing you would cause a crater that would eventually effect every living thing as the grief would spread like a ripple in a pond.

Every hair on your head is numbered and each tear you shed is collected into a special tear jar because every feeling you experience is significant not only to Our Creator but also to me.  I know that the pain you feel is real and it seems like it won't go away, but I also know that it's making you stronger somehow and that is something that you might need in order to help someone else that is going through the same thing.  You have a purpose that is so important, its vital to everyone living in the world because if you were to go then it would cause a ripple that would cause more than a loss of one life but it would take years off many peoles lives the way it would spread grief till it reached everyone.  This deep pain is not a curse, it's not abnormal either, even animals feel it as a result of their circumstances.  It will pass, time will elapse and when the Joy of God is inside of you, you will look back and wonder how you even felt this way.  Your spirit will again soar, and you will shed tears of joy, and laughter will fill your home.  I know this because your purpose isn't to die or to suffer all your life, but part of your life you will experience this so that you can be all knowing and have the capacity to heal those who are in need that are in your life just as I am with you.  Your purpose is that of a healer and that of a warrior, a fighter, and a person who is so strong and full of love that the light you shine can be blinding.  Your an amazing person, I know you are because your reading these words and these words were prepared and given to me just so I could give them to you.  My heart beats harder for you and you give me vigor and strength because I know my purpose is to heal and mend the brokenhearted and when I see your pain it gives me purpose.  For that, I thank you. You are victorious,  I know how this battle ends.  You may be down but You cannot be defeated.  I have so much faith in you and in this pain you feel because I know that it is creating in you a scar that is like armor upon your heart, you will never fall like this again. And after u heal, you will be prepared for the vital purpose that you are here for.  Try doing something different because it will give you a different feeling.
