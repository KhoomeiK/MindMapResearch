1.) The enemy has so many gapclosers Stormrazors passive does jack-shit

2.) The enemy has so few gapclosers that you can simply run em down.

3.) Zeal items give more attack speed and different passives. (Range RFC, Security and Kiting PD, Waveclear SS, Waveclear RH)

4.) Maybe its a game where they recognized they have enough security to try and get more AS to get more AAs off. This is a tradeoff compared to when you can only get a few AAs off and try to maximize their impact."
