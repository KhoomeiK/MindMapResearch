migraine,fp4lget,t1_fp428so,1588301650.0,"i had the same thing with root beer snow cones! hahaha. 

from doctors i either get told it’s my period or how much sleep i get ,,, when the migraines cause both of those things to go away. i really haven’t been able to find anything that triggers a migraine other than excessive sugar or stress. i feel like i’ve shifted around every part of my life to get some sort of relief.
i recently got access to my own medical records and my doctors never told me (or my parents) that i had abnormalities in my blood tests back in august. they’re kind of irrelevant now that it’s april but at the time it would’ve given me an idea of what was wrong with me. they also won’t tell me if i have any allergies, 
they just tell me to avoid certain foods. haha no one takes me seriously because i’m “too young to be in that much pain” so i must be “making it up” because it must be that time of the month and i’m hysterical! i’m 17 and i’ve been having migraines since i was 5-6 (i was also diagnosed then).  it just makes me wonder if i’m actually allergic to something which causes my migraines. i just feel like they aren’t telling me something ya know. 
it’s really shocking to me that i’m not the only one being ignored, i know that sounds suuuuper self centered and all. but i really wouldn’t have thought that so many people have been dismissed by their doctors for the same reasons as me."

He was sick for weeks and it was a really slow recovery. We later learned that his symptoms almost exactly mirrored covid almost a month before it was detected in the US. As more research is done and more possible symptoms are found, the more his mystery sickness seems like it was covid.

insomnia,fl3p372,t3_fm8dx8,1584793672.0,"it’s kind of like wanting to go down a slide at a park, except when you try to go down the slide (fall asleep) you get stuck at the top (awake) as if someone put superglue there. or say you finally go down the slide a little bit, but you keep stopping on it as you’re trying to go down (waking up in the middle of the night)  sorry that’s a little confusing but that’s how i explain it to my family members who don’t understand it.

most people need around 8 hours of sleep, it’s not always exactly 8. for me, an hour of sleep is enough to get me through the day groggily - but between 5-8 is ideal for energy and such. my boyfriend is the complete opposite though, he needs 10-12 hours of sleep to feel energized. brains are weird, what can i say? 

before i got medication (or even knew insomnia was a thing) i’d be awake for 2-3 days at a time multiple times a week. the only real different s is without sleep i tend to be very hungry, i don’t know how it affects others with insomnia though. 

i hope this wasn’t too confusing lol"
