Not sure if it will be worth it to them.  Attendance will be strictly limited.  Scores of attractions will be closed.  

We will get the benefit to see how other countries open up though first.  We are abysmal at it and need to learn. 

I think we can all agree on that schools better be open and in full session.  Not a great look to have kids going to Disneyland because their schools are on lockdown. That we can’t protect a classroom but we somehow can protect a theme park.

We have no testing or tracing.  

This is not ending for years.  That’s the decision we made.  At the same time we semi-paralyzed our economy.

You have to at least pretend to wash the seats and bars of any ride.  You can’t just hop in two seconds after someone else was in that spot for 10 minutes.  

This will be a horrible Disney experience coupled with a non-zero risk of getting affected.  And wherever you live.
