Seaofthieves,fr315a9,t1_fr30w4z,1589847854.0,Honestly not sure how a galleon was catching up to my duo sloop with only one sail down. Desync maybe? I definitely have been proven wrong on that note. Still confused on that whole encounter though.
Seaofthieves,fr30rqb,t1_fr2zcop,1589847639.0,Anyways I believe we may just have to agree to disagree here sadly. My sincerest apologies if I was an ass at any time during our conversation. But thank you nonetheless for having it with me
Seaofthieves,fr30now,t1_fr2z07l,1589847576.0,"I do have to agree with you on most things. Again as I said in the beginning I do enjoy pvp, in fact I feel pve servers would not be my cup of tea when I’m sailing solo. But with my more inexperienced friend group who tend to want to goof about it would be nice.

I honestly think most of the issues with the game right now come from the emissaries. It’s where my frustrations lie, as well as many others. Forts were absolutely a great addition to the game, the high stakes nature of fighting other players and holding the fort is a blast. It’s just that right now, things are rough for the average player. 

But on the last point too, and a lot of games suffer from this. What if someone doesn’t honestly have the time to learn these sorta games, should we as a whole completely throw them aside? Because I honestly don’t think the solution is always a git gud mentality but I also do not know what to do in that regard."
Seaofthieves,fr2zcop,t1_fr2xymu,1589846836.0,"Except where did I say pvp was a bad thing? Not once did I say that. And I have no idea what servers/times you’re playing on but I have run into aggro players nearly every session for the past little while. And if I’m mistaken on reaper’s not getting any sort of boost, something sus was going on with those players.

And on the sloop note, you are clearly an experienced player, not everyone is. Most everyone agrees the sloop is the most difficult ship to stay alive in. I can 1v3 a brig max. But an experienced galley crew will wipe the floor with me.

What I’m saying is the game has been fine up until the emissary update. Toxicity has been more rampant. But I still enjoy pvp, hell I had a blast fighting other crews a little over a week ago.

But my main question is what would be so horrible about tweaks? Pvp is absolutely half of the game for most, but  pve servers with some sort of downside would only benefit other players. Not the opposite. 

I’ve seen devs in plenty of other games only cater to the most experienced competitive players, and wouldn’t you know it, the playerbase dropped from those who are not that. This sub and various forums have shown that, a large number of players are frustrated, and there is a divide in the community right now. You don’t have to agree with me on everything but you have to at least see that happening."
Seaofthieves,fr2x30o,t1_fr2vzvl,1589845578.0,"When you’re flying the reaper’s emissary, you absolutely get a speed boost. Unless they tweaked the galleon to be faster, I have never seen galleys move that fast in pvp, after losing a galleon half way across the map. (We watched our table, we saw them way off in the distance) only for them to immediately be on us 30 seconds later with only one sail lowered as they were trailing at the same exact angle, sail in the same position. Pretty sure there was a boost of speed there. 

And on your second point, we had never been given any allusions to tales, nor revivals outside of arena, nor the fort of the damned. Asking for a better game for everyone is all we can do as players, unless you wish for 50% of the playerbase to either drop the game. Or just use alliance servers, which are complained about on the daily. Things need to be changed, plain and simple."
Seaofthieves,fr2v2rv,t1_fr2unx9,1589844460.0,"Yeah I could see an increase in rep rather than the opposite being good as well. It just sucks seeing the community this way as of late.

bi_irl,fq97hlc,t1_fq93amh,1589188367.0,"Yeah, but the issue with that logic is that of course you’re going to get upset if something that you are gets directly insulted. If you get upset about your gender being called trash, there’s actually a higher chance you aren’t, and getting upset is just straight up human emotion. To imagine how dumb it is, what if I said “All blondes are just complete garbage.” If you have blonde hair you might not enjoy being called names because of it. It’s an extremely asinine way of thinking, there’s plenty of toxic as fuck guys, but there’s plenty of toxic as hell women, and everything in between.

-Tutorial sucks, most players agree on that one.

-The random debuffs are completely unfair, like come on I get a debuff for life due to random number gen?!

-The server size is too small, we’ve got a load of people logging on for the first time daily and it’s causing problems.
-Far too many microtransactions, makes the game completely pay to win. 

-Certain map zones cause constant debuffs or game breaking effects. You can die just due to the map shifting, really not fair.

She gaslighted the fuck out of him, and was hellbent on destroying his career before he even had a point to refute which is like so colossally shitty. I don’t think heidi is a saint, but I probably won’t think jared is either. My main point being that, during the time jared started getting feelings for holly and heidi encouraged that, she was still engaged to someone. I can’t say the full timeline, because unlike those two blasting eachother that side of things stayed mostly private.

YAYVIDEOGAMES then responded saying to get an uninstall button mod, much to the confusion of other users. Yayvideogames then proceed to have what seemed like a mental break, spamming said thread with hundreds and hundreds of comments basically saying this “ubisoft on steamworkd drm go bye bye.” All with minor variations. Now of course this sent people into a frenzy trying to figure out what was going on, and as of now, we have found out pretty much everything. The user yayvideogames suffered from a chronic fatigue syndrome and back pain which led their life to feel awful. The user had to take quite a few meds and life was not fun for them. Now this is where things are unsure, but two variations of the story are what seems to have happened. The first is that a friend of yayvideogames posted how he took his life, and the ubisoft drm thing was either an actual mental break, or just yayvideogames messing with people for fun. The second is that yayvideogames suffered some sort of psychosis and is now doing better just based off of some forums by users of similar account names as the ones he used.
