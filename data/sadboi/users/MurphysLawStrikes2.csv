15g for a trailer. (Used)
2 g refrigerators,

The 13 and 18 year old get yelled at for litirally nothing. I was cutting my eldest nephews hair walking my eldest niece through a proper hair cut because she loves make up and hair so I figured she could taken over and trim hair when i am not there. 

Well my dad said something to us, none of us heard, and my neice (talking to her brother) said oh your nasty! In response to my nephew saying he liked something we found gross. My dad flipped thinking she was talking to him. He got up started yelling scared the shit out of me, I was like ""wtf dad she wasnt talking to you none of us heard you!""

To be honest though my dad just doesn't do well with kids so he does this with all of the children no matter what age. Hes also very big on being ""manly"" so when aunt murphy comes to town it is a system shock to my dad, because I'm very much so 'hell yeah I'll do your make up! Even as a boy' and my dad won't flip on me because well... I'm 30 and an adult spending time with my family. 

My sister and I feel the same, we teach my nieces and nephews that what they want to do or feel is valid, and not wrong , social norms are not real representations of the world. People are weird and that's fantastic! 

Being popular isn't a life goal, being happy and kind is. 

 So you wanna wear make up and a dress for dress up? Cool doesn't make you gay. 
You want to dress like a boy being a girl? cool, again doesn't make you gay.

Then at the end of the year we have to pay our own taxes, any car repairs because of the added mileage, health and not ever 100% guaranteed a wage, nor hours. 

I honestly have zero clue where it goes considering they upcharge groceries by 10 - 20%. Ask for a picture of your receipt and you'll see the charge discrepancies.

That's awesome you stopped honestly from what I heard Shipt is and has been way more fair. Instacart is not a good company. They are shisty and take advantage of a broken contract worker system.

(Checking at any time behind heavy machinery.) 3. Lose jobs / loved ones. (Ie a parent spending Little Johnny's birthday on reddit. Upsetting spouse and child.

They have everything from great beers (brew dog does some damn good NA lagers, IPAs and porters) to liqour. It helps to have your own drinks when surrounded by people indulging. NAs kinda trick your brain into believing your doing the same thing you always did, ultimately calming anxiety.

 I am so impressed with those who can do abstinence, I my self have been on so many different drugs, prescribed and not that in the beginning years I found 100% sobriety was killing me. My moodswings (bipolar) lost me more jobs than my addiction had. 

I couldn't sleep, eat and wouldn't get back on pills, I didnt want to be numb any more. I was lead to harm reduction about 5 years ago. It's shifting your addiction to something less harmful (Ie I quit alcohol, cocaine, and pills and only smoke pot.)

 I found I could smoke a shit ton of weed at night and actually sleep, get to work on time, be calm, and control my emotions. Eventually, I was able to wean myself off pot and go 100% sober when necessary. 

But i very rarely recommend this without some sort of support group. I have never been substantially influenced by others, I have no problem being sober at a bar, or watching people get drunk. Not everyone can do that. 

With that said, abstinence can be good, it all up to the individual, but an abstinence culture leads to a culture of fear, guilt and failure.

Example. You have a single beer you've fucked up in a abstinence culture.  To harm reduction, you only slid back, how you respond after is what matters. if you say ""fuck it"" then get wasted because you believe you've already failed thats a failure. If you finish that beer and go, wow! I shouldn't do that and walk away. You're not a failure. 

My big issue is gatekeeping. 
If I go to AA or NA and tell people I am doing harm reduction the response is always ""oh... then your not sober.""  By abstinence definition no. But the whole point is to improve myself for me and I've improved my life. I made my self a better person and learned self control so by my standards I am sober, despite smoking pot occasionally."

Either accept it will kill you sooner not later, and stop caring (not recommended but the most common path.) Or find something or some reason within yourself greater than getting fucked up. 

 Best Tip to stay sober.

Always have an out. Never go to a place or event without an emergency exit plan. And if you are tempted, leave, find something else to do, stay busy. 
Change your surroundings, change your schedule and focus on creating a paradise inside you.

**fact checked @ the World Health Organization and CDC.


Random theory: not fact checked... unsure how I would fact check it... let me know if I'm wrong. I'd really like to be.

If China, Korea, and Japan crash, USA is forced to inflate prices, driving a harder line between rich and poor. All  because we now have to produce everything in America, yes it would provide jobs, but increase the items cost by 1000% because of our higher living /production costs. 

Everything affordable is lost, no more cheap electronics to survive school with,  simple jeans? Haha that'll be $1000, need new tredsafe? good luck 400 to 500.

 Walmart, Amazon, google, all of these places rely on these industrial countries for affordable products to sell. the minimum wage in America will stay $7.25, health insurance will spike in cost and we are all fucked and 2017 was the beginning to the downfall of my country. We've lost rights, now we Lose affordable home/living products, it will turn middle class to lower class and keep them there. 

Rich stay rich, the poor die from lack of health care and middle class is abolished. 

Are you ready for that sweet slowmo poverty porn? I promise sarah will sing arms of an angel over a sad child holding on to a playground swing/chain link fence.

 I mean don't mind the USA we are just taking away rights and have a mass shooting daily, but we are godly! 

True fact. / random rant. 
I've already lost the right to do what I want with my own body.  ""your husband might want kids...""

 my non exsistant/ future husband should have zero say. He is not the one potentially fucking their body up and growing a human. If he wants kids, he can move the fuck on, I'm not holding him back. No women should be fucking questioned or handed religious text when inquiring about birth control/an abortion. It's my choice, my body, it's not a 'possible God's. 

Stop living to get to heaven and live to make heaven a place on earth, by being decent humans, realizing others choices are not yours, and they affect you zero % 

Screaming to take others rights because of your belief is like crying/saying ouch because someone else hurt themselves. It affected you none yet you still reacted? Why?"

People are trained from birth to be robots, not understand mental health or emotions. It is also no one else's responsibility to take care of you, depression fucking sucks, find a way to deal, make art, scream into a pillow, obsessively move your room around. 

we often mistakenly believe our mental health depends on others. It doesnt. It's up to you to get help, it's up to you to get up and shower. (Even if that's all you do. That's a win. ) 

Harsh truth is people are unreliable unless it's in their best interest. We usually struggle to see past our own issues. Blaming others for your issues and saying fuck them is an unhealthy pointless stance.

Coffee,fi8j1n5,t1_fgnd3d8,1582241412.0,"It's standard to do 30 to 40lbs of pressure. You can measure it by tamping on a cheap bathroom scale. If coffee is tamped too hard  it creates a solid puck, water searches for the easiest escape route. So the water will only glide over the surface and into cracks, not actually through the coffee.

A few side notes, tapping after you tamp is bad it breaks the puck essentially doing the same as described above. 

Espresso should have the texture of river sand with no uneven grinds. 

To avoid injury tamp on a surface even with your hip keeping your arm at a 90 degree angle and lean into it, repeatedly pushing using your shoulder will tear your rotator cuff or worse. when polishing stop and twist the tamp with your fingers, polishing using your wrist will mess up your shoulder and your wrist sheath."

3. Use a straw to take deep long controlled breaths. Often we panic and hyperventilate, preventing us from controling how we intake air. Using a straw will give your body, and mind a different focus.

Denton,fb8jw7p,t3_e1my59,1576615517.0,"Start this by saying I am so sorry girl we did not know! We thought he called you we had all day to look. He could have told us hang on. 

This all makes me a bit nervous. I just started renting from him... the day we came to see the house we called and he gave us a two hour window. So we wondered around. Arriving at the house a few minutes late. there was a vehicle in the drive. We assumed it was his, never seeing him or his vehicle. 

We knocked no answer. But a dog started barking and it struck us that somone was living here still. 15 min go buy and Gary shows up smiles and charm. Funny guy I'll say, though I had my tall tattooed fiancee with me so I stayed next to him as he wondered around showing off faux wood blinds.

All the while this poor girl we just intruded on is chain smoking cigarettes in back. We were told she knew. Then told she had just woken up! Fuck I would be fucking losing my shit if he just walked in with people in tow. I am a very private person with a lot of anxiety. Anxiety that keeps me off the phone, I can't talk to people unless I see their face I freeze, get distracted by my own brain.... (very counter productive if online resources are not available)

Anyways we walked to the house so he offered to give us a ride to chase. I dont write checks too easy to forge, so we get a money order and pay the holding fee and proceeded on our way... well then he takes us to 1/8th the houses to show off ""Halloween decorations"" 

Semi Red flag...  so he just drives by all of his properties to check them out. (He has 52 by the way) all on public domain. My logic and need for housing kicked in. ""Of course he does he has to see the condition. It's because he cares!... and really likes yellow""... why the fuck would you use matte paint outside? That holds all the dirt.... I digress.

We've been fucked too many times to let someone do it again so... go anxiety email text relationship only! :D 0

Though... I'm hoping he never comes in unannounced.... all of our main hobbies are shooting at the range and three of us are licensed to carry and very good shots. 

Pretty much anyone is likely to be shot if walking into my house unannounced at odd times. 

We've lived in neighborhoods where theft and Robbery is common. I leave my car unlocked because I got tired of replacing windows.. there's just never anything to steal.  Except a grapefruit spoon... don't take my spoon please i just it... well no I found it and didn't want to run over it so now it lives in my car. Take it If you need it :) 

Truthfully though all this being said we are not in a position to be picky. We just moved here to start a business and We have a 100lb great dane. We needed a house and no one here rents to people with large dogs. 

Coming from a place where every landlord's shifty. I lived in a 1 bed room apt that had 1 water heater per building. We took showers in the rain and boiled water for baths. 1250 a month.... (also said place I got broken into several times)
1500 dollar a month 700 soft house with collapsing foundation (pack sand bags and a car lift that will work)

Im sure we will be fine if Gary just does his job and we pay our rent on time. I have yet to have a negative experience but also I'm paranoid as shit so... thank y'all for giving me definite signs to watch and things to try to curb. 

If it's your first time renting I cant reiterate this too much Keep every record and dont do business deals over the phone."

Hawaii's living costs are almost 1000x higher than the average coffee farm in Honduras, Africa, or anywhere along the coffee belt. 
That has to be factored into the price. That is how the farmers, workers, and their family's (I mean everyone up to the roaster and retail store) don't starve or have to live 10 people deep like they do in the majority of the country's coffee is grown. 

If you spend 8 dollars a pound here. The farmer is making .25-1 dollar. Per pound.
