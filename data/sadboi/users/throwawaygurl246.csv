You literally live with her and you’re going to make things awkward and miserable for her and yourself. You don’t necessarily have to be friends, but don’t be passive aggressive/rude. Be mature about it and decide if you want to keep living there or not. I mean, she wants to be your friend still. Not much lost and not much gained."

I feel like if I get one negative thought or imagine the wrong thing, I’m going to ruin my entire life. Because of that, I sometimes wish I didn’t know about LOA.

lawofattraction,fqa1m1t,t3_ghov3v,1589211176.0,"Hey, I know the feeling. Being ghosted and them not having the decency to give an explanation is the worst. Trying to get something you want for so long and not getting it also sucks. Maybe it’s good that you got angry with the universe and want to give up. Maybe this is a good opportunity to do great things for yourself instead! I also got ghosted, but I think of it like this: if they ghosted,  that leaves opportunity for them to eventually apologize, to rekindle things with you, and to mend things in their own time. That gives them room to miss you and wonder what you’re up to. I know it seems impossible now, but having a bridge of incidents like that is a lot of times what ends up being the reason things get pieced back together. You’ll either get her back, or someone better. Or both. I hope things get better for you. I know they will. :)"

I think he could miss me, so I get the FEELINGS of being missed and wanted. When I say we’re a happy couple, I feel stupid and like I’m lying to myself.

BPD,foetrtm,t3_g72ntn,1587714478.0,"“from a borderline” “the borderline I was involved with” let’s first clarify that she’s a human being and not just a borderline. Aka not just a personality disorder. Especially when you end the post with “bpd seems more like her.” You’re just making snarky assumptions?
Anyway, aside from that there’s no obvious answer because it seems like she’s being stubborn. The only thing I could think of to do is wait a little bit and then send a very calm message explaining that you need want your stuff back and why. Give her options, like she can mail it or have a mutual friend give it to you. I would focus on that first and foremost, not giving an intervention."
AskReddit,focwy5p,t3_g6o792,1587676967.0,"The person I was talking to lead me on, and chose someone over me. He took her on all the dates he planned with me. It turned into an obsession of wondering what I did wrong, if it’s the way I look, and comparing her to myself so I could change whatever is wrong about me. It started out innocently looking at her social media and then got worse and worse. I also have personality disorder which didn’t help. It was emotionally driven, not logically. So to sum it up: low self esteem. Resentment. Emotional attachment."
BPD,foc9o20,t3_g6s9r2,1587668744.0,"I’m always very supportive of people communicating and having proper/positive closure, but I’m not completely sure what the right thing to do in your case is. It seems like you’re going to basically say something similar to before, that the friendship can’t be revived and you don’t want her in your life. I don’t think she needs to hear that twice! It’s kind of like you’re saying “I forgive you but not enough.” On the other hand, I’ve had someone forgive me but not want me in their life still and it gave me so much peace to have their forgiveness. I’d say you should wait on it. Maybe write some drafts on what exactly you’d say, and then decide if it’s worth it or not."
BPD,fobmba4,t3_g6q7h8,1587661278.0,"I relate to so much of this, I constantly need to make sure things are okay. And if they aren’t, I’m already planning my action on how to fix it. This could be a really good quality if we went about it in a better and less obsessive way lol. As for closure, personally I don’t think it’s overrated. Closure has helped me move past things so much quicker and easier. When I don’t get closure, I’ll obsess over it forever."
BPD,fo8z8qc,t1_fo8snv0,1587607001.0,I related to all of this! Definitely the relationships with other people is a huge factor in it. I work retail now but told them to give me the least hours possible because I couldn’t handle more. I hope your mental health/life gets a little better!
BPD,fo82zu0,t3_g67rri,1587588995.0,"I have very unstable job history and also quit every job after a few months. I think it’s directly related to my BPD. It took a lot of time, but I finally found what worked for me. I worked at a call center part time. It paid decent and was extremely easy. The scheduling was lenient and pretty much any shift could get covered if I needed it to. It didn’t put much mental stress on me, and I think that allowed me to get through school and not quit so much easier. It was really all about finding a good balance and a job I didn’t completely hate."
lawofattraction,fo82f0h,t3_g68irr,1587588701.0,"Hi! This exact thing happened to me. Like, as soon as I discovered LOA the exact opposite of everything I wanted happened. Everything went downhill and every worst case scenario ever happened. I felt incredibly confused and hopeless. There wasn’t anything I could do. Things have gotten better, though. When I feel like this, I usually go through a process of just letting myself feel it. Letting myself cope with things, and accept what’s happening was necessary. Because I also felt like pretending everything was okay was downright exhausting and a lie to myself. But I kept repeating “I can still get what I want even though I feel like this.” I took it day by day. After the coping process, I have found methods of picking myself back up. When I feel down, I watch funny videos and tv shows. I watch positive LOA videos and I read success stories on here. I talk to people that cheer me up and I do lots of affirmations. I take extra time washing my hair, getting ready, cleaning, anything to take care of myself and feel better. I think it’s pretty common for things to not be linear, and to even seemingly get bad all at once. You can always go up from here, and a lot of people say it’s just old thoughts and feelings presenting themselves. Things will get better, and all of the bad stuff can be the beginning of the road to success. Hope that helps:)"
BPD,fo1j77n,t3_g562ww,1587434454.0,Definitely wait and see if she reaches out first. I think trying to mend things right now would be adding fuel to fire (is that the right phrase?) It could easily make things worse and it’s better to let people come around in their own time if they want to. It sounds like she needs space and I would respect that! You’ve tried your best.

I’m not the best at knowing what to say, but I do know heartbreak and how hard it is to get through. I was in the same place as you. For me personally, I HAD to take the time to be alone and let it all out. I slept a lot and never ate and it was depressing but it was a lot better than pretending to be okay. I know that distractions are really helpful, things like watching movies or YouTube, inspirational videos/podcasts, writing, drawing, etc. I watched videos on people going through similar things to me. there’s also lots of online therapists right now if you’re able to do that. He sucks and cheating is disgusting. I’m sending u love and support!!"
BPD,fny1ib8,t1_fny0y1j,1587351153.0,For me personally it’s because I have really low self esteem and would rather exist as little as possible to others.

RelationshipAdviceNow,fnxl751,t3_g4ia43,1587340948.0,"Idk, I personally wouldn’t jump to that conclusion yet. Usually I say something similar, and it’s because I’m not good at holding conversations through text when I’m out doing things. It’s possible he wants to give you undivided attention when talking to you. And he’s also communicating when he’s leaving and coming back! I see why you were concerned, but maybe just take it day by day and see how things go."
BPD,fnxh7tc,t3_g4hl8e,1587338570.0,"Wow this happened to me and I found out he was going on like 50 different girl’s chaturbates EVERY day. I agree with you, it’s way more personal than porn and I also consider it cheating. Especially if they’re paying. Honestly it ruined my self esteem lol. Personally, I don’t think you should do something back to hurt him. Because it will turn into a “who can do the worst thing to one another” back and forth competition ya know? He’s being very invalidating and unfair.  However, I think there should definitely be consequences or a deep and long talk about it or something. I’m not really sure what the best solution is, because I’d feel so hurt that I’d just leave. (Which I did) At the very least I definitely would not pretend things are fine. I’m sorry you’re going through this. I’m not the best at relationship advice but I understand what you’re going through."

lawofattraction,fnfv0q1,t3_g1ijlw,1586916052.0,"In my opinion, it’s not messing with free will at all because you can’t force someone to do anything. Anything someone does is their own decision and doing. To the best of my knowledge, people that are using LOA to improve their love lives are taught to love themselves first, write down what they want from a relationship, be happy on their own, be in alignment, etc. You come first!! And let’s say you attract someone who is loving/loyal/etc.... they were energetically gravitated to you for that same reason. They more than likely also were looking for someone loving and loyal. No matter what, whoever you attract shows up because they align with your energy. Not because you forced them hehe"
BPD,fndoche,t3_g1404u,1586874354.0,"It’s really interesting the way we can get hung up on specific people, even when there’s other people that we could be hung up on or invested in. I feel like moving forward from things like this, especially with bpd, can be so long and agonizing. And especially when they leave you for someone else. That happened to me and I’m still trying to cope years later. And trying to make sense of it all? Like why can’t I just not care!!!?

BPD,fnann8u,t3_g0nrs4,1586800616.0,"I’ve had so so many jobs and I’ve quit without warning because of people too depressed to show up. I kind of get manic, act up at work, and get to the point where I’m like “I literally can’t do this another second I’m not going back.” The good thing is I’ve found some jobs and some ways to manage jobs a little easier so I’ll share them with you. 

First, I try to make my job seem like only a small portion of my day. I try to do things before and after work. Like get coffee/tea, listen to good music, take a new route to work. I try to do something fun or relaxing afterwards. That way work isn’t the only thing I do in my life. 

Second, I’ve found ways to have a small side gigs and so the side incomes add up. That way I’m not doing ONE thing full time. 

Third, just trying really hard to find things I like about any job. I’m very socially anxious, but if I make even one friend at work, it makes the day so much better. Finding one task, one person, one thing to look forward to, even if it’s lunch, helps so much!

I know it can be hard and it helps a lot if you work in a field you enjoy. Good luck!!"

I’m diagnosed and even then, it’s so complex that I understand why someone wouldn’t understand unless they’ve done hard research on it.  With my apology, I didn’t bring up BPD even though that’s a huge factor in why I did what I did. I didn’t want it to seem like I was making excuses.

Having a sugar daddy has become way more normalized, and I’m sure you’ve heard the good side of it way more than the bad. It definitely has risks, and it’s not your fault this guy ended up being terrible. It could have been a really fun experience, but it wasn’t and that’s HIS fault. Also if he knowingly has an STD and slept with you, he can definitely face legal consequences. 

I’m sorry you went through that and I understand why you went and did it. Forgiving yourself and moving on from situations can be so hard. I’m not really good at that myself. Take it as a learning experience! Think about it logically. He wasn’t a good guy, he scammed you.

I felt like I was an embarrassment and that he he thought she’d be more fun to do those things with. I stopped eating, stopped sleeping, dropped out of school, and was very suicidal. I showed up where they were eating and flipped her off and chased them down the road. They called the cops, and because he worked with me, he tried getting me fired.

I kind of get it, because they don’t want to jump to the assumption that you have it. Instead of that, try spending time talking about the symptoms without relating it to anything. I’d definitely put emphasis on your BPD symptoms (and be specific) so she’s aware that they are present and need help. She’ll diagnose you when/if needed. In my opinion, getting help for solely depression or anxiety would NOT help with many of BPD’s symptoms. Sometimes therapists have odd replies and advice I’ve noticed lol. Hope that helps!!"
lawofattraction,fm7lu1v,t1_fm73nhi,1585831098.0,search on YouTube! I can’t explain it very well
nevillegoddardsp,fm6vtem,t3_fsu7mt,1585804716.0,I have a really hard time visualizing my SP because its been so long since I’ve seen him or heard him in person. But I CAN imagine myself from his view! This is a really good idea that I’ve never thought of and I’m going to try it. Thank u!!
lawofattraction,fm6v2qq,t3_ft3cua,1585804095.0,"All of this is based off of what I’ve studied and my own opinions on it. It’s a very controversial subject and people usually feel very strongly about it lol. 

First of, free will: it’s not against her free will. If she came back, she did it willingly. Any person who has been manifested back, did it because they WANTED TO. You can’t physically make her speak to you or come back in your life.  It is literally not messing with someone’s free will to manifest them. It’s not like you’re holding her hostage. No one has the ability to mess with someone’s free will in my opinion.

Second, what if she doesn’t want to come back: she’s not back to you yet. Which means you have work to do. I don’t think you should focus on what “she wants.” One, because you don’t know what she wants. Two, things are changing all the time. People change, things change, energy changes, opinions change, wants change.


It’s not really about positivity, but more so alignment. Feel good about yourself and your life. Be happy and content with living in the moment. Don’t obsess over her, and if you think about her, try to make it good thoughts. Positive visualizing. Attracting an ex/person into your life is all about energetic vibrations. Work on yourself! The idea is that you’re the best and happiest version of yourself which will attract many good things into your life:) watch some videos on LOA and read about it. Hope that helps!"
BPD,fm6t515,t3_fteg4t,1585802508.0,"Everyone’s symptoms are different and certain ones are more/less heightened than others. It really just depends! It’s a good thing that you’re being understanding and taking it into consideration. I think you should go about everything as normal. With time, you’ll pick up on how to navigate the relationship."
confession,fm6so99,t1_fm6qpr2,1585802141.0,LOL
BPD,fly4mxi,t3_frwuzv,1585595449.0,Absolutely not
BPD,flxpf63,t1_flxp2ma,1585587323.0,"Also sorry, my answer was more about making friends on there and I’m not sure if you’re wanting friends or a date!!! :( but I think the advice can be used either way!!"
BPD,flxoyte,t3_frtv5a,1585587077.0,"Bumble has the option for meeting friends, and I think it’s good because you can pick and choose who you’d seemingly get along with. So right off the bat, it takes away the pressure of not knowing anything about the person (the way you would meeting someone in person.) Friendship isn’t linear, so it’s not you going from being strangers immediately to close friends. You can let them in as much as you want in your own time. Also try to have fun with it!  Take your time. Ease into it. I’ve met a lot of cool people that way. Just remember that different friends have different purposes. You could meet people that end up being just an internet friend, someone that you end up being super close with, an acquaintance, travel buddy, etc.Hope that helps!!"
BPD,floq1cn,t1_flop641,1585343162.0,This was spot on :(
BPD,flj66p7,t3_foyvll,1585200174.0,"YES. And even if I have a good reason to dislike them, it doesn’t explain/justify the intense deep hatred and anger I feel towards them. It has happened to me twice recently and it’s so draining to feel that deep of a hatred (for someone that isn’t myself) hehehe"
BPD,fl5gvur,t3_fmq9cf,1584836424.0,This was so relatable :(
BPD,fl5frkf,t1_fl5fkqp,1584835683.0,I understand that it’s a big deal. It’s incredibly dangerous and deadly for so many people. It’s hard to tell which comments you’re replying to on mobile. I see where you are coming from.  I should have kept my rant focused on BPD and not anything else because it has clearly upset everyone. I think it’s an obsession when I can’t even talk about any subject in the universe with people and have them not turn it into a covid-19 conversation. Take care.
BPD,fl5eicg,t1_fl3envp,1584834847.0,100% agree!!
BPD,fl5d4vn,t1_fl5cu20,1584833951.0,"I mean, if catching it means I never have to see you comment on my post again, I’d be glad ❤️"
BPD,fl35cbg,t1_fl351tm,1584769352.0,Use that quote as much as you’d like!! Lol. I agree with absolutely everything you’ve said. Trying to make people understand the many effects this situation has had is exhausting. And thank you for your kindness. You’re 1000% valid in how you feel as well.
BPD,fl21ck2,t1_fl1s8ec,1584740745.0,Really? I’ve been thinking of trying discord but I don’t know anything about it!!
BPD,fl1b3td,t1_fl1aags,1584725509.0,"It’s like a lose lose and finding relief is hard. I’m glad we’re not alone in feeling like this, but also wish it wasn’t like this. I hope things get better for you!!"
BPD,fl18ip0,t1_fl18bo3,1584724071.0,thank you I appreciate that!!
BPD,fl16f3z,t1_fl169iy,1584722902.0,Well I have people mad at me for self-isolating and I have people mad at me for not going outside. Crazy the way I wanted to vent and everyone made it worse:) I care about the elderly too which is why I’m not around them. Or in public at all. Or around anyone else.
BPD,fl15pq2,t1_fl15avy,1584722512.0,"I don’t know of one person who is actually 100% alone right now. Besides me. Also if you guys feel this mad about me literally be inside and alone for almost two weeks, I can’t imagine how you feel about all the people in Florida partying on the beach. As I said to the bitch that was being rude to me, this is about BPD and social isolation. Not my fault you all read one part of my post and went crazy."
BPD,fl12n48,t1_fl0t7u8,1584720804.0,Thank you!!
BPD,fl103nz,t1_fl0uped,1584719359.0,"I wish she would’ve invited you too :(( You definitely deserved to be there just like everyone else. Being left out/stood up sucks. I’m proud of you for not picking a fight, I don’t think I could’ve stopped myself."
BPD,fl0zqkf,t1_fl0fsdz,1584719151.0,I just related to everything you said. I’m sorry and I hope it gets better!!
BPD,fl0yxf5,t1_fl0ysbx,1584718679.0,I pointed that out because you asked why I’m complaining about it. I’m complaining because I wanted to vent and this is a place to vent. I don’t care if you give your opinion or not.
BPD,fl0xelq,t1_fl0mwvi,1584717776.0,I’ve gone outside a few times to go walking and stuff but the isolation is starting to drive me crazy lol. The point in all of this is to stay inside and away from people so.... also mental illness isn’t cured by going outside 🤗
BPD,fl0xd7x,t1_fl0p5po,1584717753.0,ur username is accurate.
