You are the master of your own life, never let anyone dictate your path. Doing something just because you want to show them won't help anyone, certainly not you.

I feel you, I also struggle with social anxiety and have trouble communicating and establishing relationships. I've spent 3 years completely alone because my former friends treated me with contempt because of my depression, so I had to cut them off. Later on managed to find two great people with whom I am now good friends. They are intelligent enough that my depression doesn't bother them.

I haven't achieved much in my life, but I have come to the realization that it's not what matters. Life is not a competition of who has a better life. What matters is spending time with people that care about you and basically doing anything that makes you feel good. 

One of the worst thing about depression is the self-hate. Every time you fail at something or even if you're just stressed you bring yourself down. Depression makes you feel useless and dumb, but that is not true! It's just the voice of depression trying to bring you down. Try to remember that every time you berate yourself for something. Once you realize this it gets easier to banish those thoughts. These thoughts are usually irrational after all. Every time this happens to me I basically talk to myself and remind myself that I am a good person and apologize to self for being so mean. It helps."

The thing is if you have only friends to share your problems with, it can get overwhelming for them, especially for the less intelligent ones. Partly due to the fact that only talking about your issues does not help much and it just goes on. I'd suggest seeking professional therapy, which can help you actively deal with your issues, change the negative thought patterns and find a way out of the vicious cycle of hopelesness. The combination of therapy and having good friends was what finally turned the tide for me and I can feel my mental health slowly improving. It takes a lot of effort and work, but it is possible.

During my darkest time in life I was completely alone, I had to cut off my friends because they treated my with contempt because of my depression and just didn't give a shit. I didn't even vent to them much. I desperately wanted to find a way out and I decided to try therapy before I take my own life. Later on I managed to befriend two co-workers, who are great people and we gradually became good friends. My depression never bothered them. I believe that the combination of these two life choices is what saved my life."

It seems more like their problem than yours. That's just contradictory as fuck. They probably didn't know what to do, but it's wrong to offer help and then so blatantly disregard you for being a burden.

Like I said, not everyone reacts this way to a depressed person. The best thing you can do is not to rely on one source of help, that's never going to be enough. Your best option is to combine professional therapy and hanging out with friends with whom you can share your feeling. That way it's balanced out and not overwhelming for your friends.

That is the perfect analogy for your situation as well. It's not true that you are a monster and don't deserve life. That's the depression talking. It has taken over your brain and is feeding you these lies. It makes everything seem extremely negative and hopeless. Once you realize this, it actually helps you fight it. 

You shouldn't close yourself to people. Those who care about you make life at least bearable if not enjoyable. Don't think that you don't deserve them or that you are a burden. You deserve to be loved! I am aware that not everyone can handle being around a depressed person, but such people don't love you, otherwise they wouldn't have left. They don't deserve you, not the other way around. I speak from experience. Six years ago I lost all my friends because of my depression. It turns out they didn't really care about me and left merely because it was uncomfortable to them. Two years later, when I was at my lowest, I befriended two people, who turned out to be much better people then those former friends have ever been. We are now best friends.

I've been struggling with a serious clinical depression for 6 years. I have considered killing myself many times. I have never experienced what it is like to be loved, but I crave love so desperately that I refuse to leave without finding it and living it. I am going through therapy, it is hard work, sometimes painful, but I can feel my mental health is slowly getting better.

SuicideWatch,f4uw71u,t3_dlu2vn,1571831285.0,"I feel you. I've lost count of how many times I contemplate suicide. All I ever wanted in life is to be loved. Yet it seems to be an impossible task. No matter what I do I always get rejected or straight up indifference. Even if I meet someone with whom I have a connection unlike the both of us ever had before, still she rejects me and pushes me into the friendzone. WTF?! I know for a fact that she and many more people I know got together with their SO for much less significant reasons. I just don't get it. Am I unlovable? What's wrong with me? It seems surreal to watch others live their lives happily, having relationships, like it's so easy for them.

So I live in a perpetual state of loneliness, carrying the burden of a serious depression all alone. It is becoming unbearable. I have several friends, but they don't seem to care much. I feel like a spectator in my own life, watching behind a glass window. Everything just goes by as I slowly fade away."
SuicideWatch,f4un4dj,t3_dlu2p3,1571818907.0,"What? How can someone be so insensitive when all you do is confide in them? Fuck that person! Obviously, they don't really care about you, otherwise they wouldn't have ever said that.

Truth to the matter is you do need people. It's the way our brains are set, we need social interaction or suffer from neglect. As unfortunate as it is for people in our situation, we can't live without someone close, no matter how we might wish to. I have several friends but none of them is close to me no matter how much I show that I care. They just treat me as a casual friend of sorts. I live in a state of perpetual loneliness, there is no one who would actually give a shit. Even though all I want in life is to be loved.

Most people who have never experienced mental illness will never understand you, DO NOT take their opinions at face value. I feel exactly the same way about socializing. I seem to ba failing at that at every turn. In both our cases we carry something that is dragging us down, thus preventing us from forming healthy relationships. In my case it's childhood abuse combined with serious depression. Don't blame yourself, illness doesn't choose who to take, it just happens. Try to find someone who is in similar situation, they are the only ones who can possibly understand you and be your friend."

I envy you such close connection and love between the two of you :) This is precisely the kind of thing that makes life worth living, unconditional love.

It is so wholesome to read. I wish you the best!"
SuicideWatch,f4pkavm,t3_dkxxh8,1571735447.0,"Man, fuck your family! Spend time with someone who appreciates you and treats you nice instead of those who bring you down just because you don't fit their vision for you. I come from an abusive household so I've learned only to be around kind people and to avoid everyone else. I am very careful about who to let close.

Don't think you don't deserve life just because you are in a bad place and are suffering right now. Your consciousness was created with a specific purpose, to live. In nature everything has a purpose, nothing is meaningless, even though we sometimes don't realize it. 

I am struggling as well my friend, but I refuse to believe that this is all that my life has come to. There are some things I've never experienced, for instance what is like to be loved. I refuse to leave until I reach the things that are important to me. I can't accept the thought that my entire life was suffering and nothing else. There has to be more to it."
