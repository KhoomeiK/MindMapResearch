I was “released” from my college for not going to class and failing multiple semesters in a row. I finally went back after I found the right medication, spent some time adjusting to real life and was stable for an extended period of time. 

This was super helpful: I would send my parents (if you have anyone, SO, sibling, anyone you trust. If you don’t, you can message me) a photo somewhere on campus or in class where the date was visible - a newspaper in the student lounge, the intro slide on a class PowerPoint, whatever. It held me accountable and alerted someone if I fell into a depressive episode.

Granted, there was an understanding that I had some rough days that I needed a mental health day. My parents understood this, so they knew how many classes I could miss per course and knew if I missed more than a day in a row. I also had accommodations with my school’s disability office which was SO helpful. Definitely look into that. I hope this helps!"

MedSpouse,f39cqwg,t3_dfzhcq,1570746480.0,"My husband (M2) and I have both struggled with our health/weight since he started - we both stress eat and don't have the best will power in the world. But here's what has worked so far:

The free food is a KILLER. It's still hard to say no, but we found that if he makes a lunch and takes it with him, he's more likely to skip the free food because he feels guilty wasting our food/money. I know it's tempting to say *but it's free*, but sometimes that doesn't mean it's worth it. If he does end up going for the free food, he just cuts down his portions (i.e. instead of taking 2-3 slices of pizza, he takes 1 slice and loads up on salad or if there are pastries/bagels, he'll take half and eat fruit).

Gym wise, I noticed that I felt really self-conscious and defensive when he would say ""we need to go to the gym"" anytime we were eating crappy or I was having a bad day. Instead, I figured out we do best when we just PLAN for the gym. Don't talk about it. Just look at your calendars and say ""okay, we have a free day/morning/afternoon, let's plan to go to the gym or class then."" Treat it like a business meeting, set a reminder and it helps to go together.

Find something she likes to do! You said she likes that class, which is awesome. I get really bored working out which is why if I just go and use a treadmill, I won't stick with it. I would suggest kickboxing because it's great for a workout but added bonus: she can beat the shit out of something and let out some of that stress. Or yoga, get some relaxation on while you workout.

Compliment the hell out of her. And make it specific. If she's got a cute butt, tell her. If she's had a week where she stepped up her healthy food/workout game, tell her you can tell she looks a little skinnier. The best thing you can do is boost her confidence. 

Good luck! I feel like this is one of those med-life struggles we all deal with that isn't talked about as much. At the end of the day, just be there for her."

If you truly, deeply love this person, it will absolutely be okay. It will be worth it. 

I do want to make sure you’re prepared mentally that life won’t be the same as what you have now. You’ll still get to do all those things, they’ll just be less frequent. I’ve found that the people who say that they never see their spouse and life has stopped usually haven’t figured out how to work around this new schedule or have a spouse who doesn’t prioritize the relationship. 

Have conversations now about expectations. Make your relationship a priority while also understanding that you’ll be their support system in the background for a little while. 

Make sure you have some hobbies. Learn how to be comfortable being alone - I’m an avid skier and have learned to love going by myself. Make new friends in the city where you land. Also know that if you do this, your career will take second place so you’ll have to leave companies you love. As long as your partner outweighs your career ambitions, you’ll be fine!

For what it’s worth, my husband and I still have time to watch our shows, eat meals together, go on date nights. We still do fun activities that we work around his schedule. And we travel during breaks. 

You’ll be fine! I promise. It’s scary, but you sound like you have a really healthy relationship. Just look at it as another adventure.

AskReddit,ex3taz8,t1_ex0zjz0,1565991152.0,"Not a parent, but diagnosed at 19 and have been stable and healthy for about 10 years. Speaking as the “child,” make sure you find the right medication (which can sometime need tweaking) and stick to it. There’s a stigma around being medicated and a lot of people think “oh, I’m doing better, I don’t need them anymore.” It’s a lifelong disease, so it won’t just be cured. With a kid so young, you have the awesome opportunity to normalize the meds so it’s just a regular part of their life...just like taking a vitamin everyday to stay healthy and strong. 

Parenting-wise, the fact that you’re asking that question means you’re already doing a great job. Make sure as they get older, they know they can be open with you about how they’re feeling. From the outside, bipolar symptoms can make your kid seem like they’re being lazy/unmotivated (depressive episodes) or irresponsible/reckless (manic episodes). This should be pretty well controlled with proper treatment, but keep an eye out for those extremes because it might mean they need to see their doctor. The misconception is a person having crazy mood swings, but it’s actually more behavioral than emotional. 

Try to always be understanding, but if they have any relapses as they get older, they might need a little tough love. People with personality disorders sometimes lie out of shame or avoidance (ie, saying they’re taking their meds, going to the doctor, they have a job when they don’t, etc). It’s not completely their fault, but hold them accountable. Since your kiddo was diagnosed so early, you have the opportunity to limit the stigma and assure them throughout their life that this is just a normal disease that can be controlled and it’s totally okay. It makes them special and strong. 

Sorry if this was lengthy (this barely scratches the surface), but I think you can avoid the problems that a lot of people go through with loved ones since it was caught so early. Feel free to send me a message if you ever have questions/need advice (from my perspective, but also what I wish my parents had done differently and what they did well).

I hope this isn’t too blunt, but I’m a big fan of getting straight to the point: is the relationship worth the extra work you’re going to have to put into it? The next few years will get worse, especially when he gets to studying for his Steps and his residency. It sounds like he doesn’t prioritize your relationship, which means however you’re currently feeling will just get worse unless he acknowledges he’s slacking and is willing to put time and effort into being a good boyfriend. You have needs, too. You’re not Mother Teresa. 

If you’re still in it, I would recommend he meets with an advisor regarding his poor time management. Med schools employ people to get students whatever help they need to succeed and he should make sure he’s using that resource if he’s struggling that much. There are people who just genuinely can’t get the hang of the tough schedule, but there are also people who use med school as an excuse to put less work into relationships.
