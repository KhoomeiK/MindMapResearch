KalistaMains,fq97mpf,t1_fq814oy,1589188515.0,"I honestly dont want her winrate to increase, as I said on other comment i want her to be playable and win with my skill."
KalistaMains,fq97j3p,t1_fq8ffrh,1589188411.0,"I would like some nerfs to kalista with some quality of life changes. I dont want her to be op so enemies ban or pick her but, she's currently quite annyoing to play and (unless she's buffed and op) only people who main her play her. Just remove the slow nerfing your dps (make the jump less distance not less speed), the 90% dmg thing, the several bugs she has (attacks not working, weird jumps, rend killing enemy and not resetting, rend resetting but not killing enemy, and many more I dont remember), improve the attack click and attack move on her. And probably many more I dont even want to start to think about it. Just make her playable even if worse than most adcs i wanna win because i'm good and comfortable with my champ."
KalistaMains,fq5b7b4,t3_ggxgwv,1589098802.0,"Yeah it's been said, most of the times i saw an answer like ""pyke r, cho r, etc are executions while kalista is a stack based dmg so it isnt the same"" idk i think it could be cool but would just make her easier to play wich is not bad but not too good imo"
diablo3,fpg157i,t3_gd7mqd,1588590938.0,"90% of the times movement speed since there is a cap if 25% from items and paragon and you can get the cap only with paragon and barely any other stat (that isn't dmg of something you dont use or something like that) us better than MS on an item, get MS from paragon and nothing on gear if posible"
diablo3,fmb6bdu,t3_fu27sd,1585919477.0,"All the comments in here just talk about probability but they don't take into account that in computing there is no way of ""flipping a coin"" completely random. (After this it's what i think might be the case, not based on sources, only experience) System is probably based on a number generated by a seed and that number might be MOD 100 (makes the number between 0-99, kinda) and if you want 60% chance of something happening you make it happen if that number is <60. The seed being used might be the current time and this generated number is not perfect and probably there is a lot of close numbers in sequences. That said, the probability comments are right about sometimes happens, we play a lot and we only keep in mind the one we got rekt or the big victories (my 60 60 30 15 succes) ."

diablo3,fjjmkd8,t3_fdstts,1583403586.0,"The other comment who told you to get the set is wrong. The set they give is pure trash, it's not worth your time. If you're on a 4 group (if you're not, don't start necro) all 3 necros share loot, each necro will keep and recieve the items from the other necros yo get one build. One will gear the znec (supp), one will gear the rathma mages (the set) since it's more dmg early season, the other will try to gear a LoD mages, the dps will ALWAYS level the LoD gem (both the one with set and the one with LoD on), once the dps with set has around 5-8 ancient and LoD +40 OR LoD +60 and you have tasker and theo (can do before 60 if have some ancients), if you have that, you swap to LoD, swap fast, don't make your group to stop. Numbers above come from my memory, can be really wrong, if you want more precise ones you can check svr_90 stream on Twitch (check last english stream) where he makes this conclusion there. If you're overwhelmed by what i said, just ignore anyone and enjoy, play what you want. This is purely trying to be as efficient as possible, not needed to follow these at all since it will save you maybe one hour top if you do it right and id you think it too much and don't manage your items it can even loose you time. Gl and hf, sorry for big text"

depression,fj0rqul,t1_fizyfkg,1582906396.0,"Since you say 70-80 years i can guess you're around my age or lower (20) i feel the same way. Sometimes my grandparents say things like, we'll see how you are when you're my age (health) and i always think ""do i really want to live that long ir it's going to be like this?""

After some seconds of all of them looking at eachother thinking what that means i decided to say, ""i know it"". My oncle laughted hard, thanks god he didn't say what it is."

KalistaMains,find9nn,t3_f8rdwg,1582561172.0,"Slows don't slow jump speed, they reduce jump distance. Get rid of w active, maybe give it a long cd and that it removes slows and roots. Maybe if this makes her too powerful, increase the epic monsters damage reduction to make it less powerful on pro play while not being too much on low elos (cause there is less macro for objectives), also a good QoL, dont miss when out of vision. I think this would be my aproach to make her not annyoing to play while closing the gap between pro and solo."

SuicideWatch,fi1dybz,t3_f5supb,1582055834.0,"Whenever you're on the spot of really thinking about that there is no coward choice. Suicide is against every instinct of survival we have, it's never the easy way to make a decision like this even if you really lost the will to keep going. On the other side, not doing it is as hard since (if you're thinking about it) you're going through a bad time and you're suffering a lot and you keep going despite the pain, maybe because you you're not fully ""convinced"" that you want to die, you don't want to hurt/loose someone or you just think deep inside there will be a better time even tho you can't think about how you'll get there. Either choice is hard enough to think that you're a coward for not chosing the other. Don't look at them like ""the easy way out"" or ""not brave enough to do it"", think something like ""going against every survival instinct"" or ""suffer in order to have chance to get better"". This said, i think either choice is hard to make (or to not make) and should be respected but everyone in that position should choose to stay and try to keep going because, who knows what could happen? Hope i didn't mess up any ideas because i'm not a good writter and not my native language.
If you want to talk, i'm here, you know what i think you should choose to do. I'm in a bad spot too so i get at least some of the thoughts you have."

Imo as kalista you take very good advantage of wits' AS and on-hit dmg and you also take advantage of the SV sustain/tank but maybe the ad you loose can lower your e's dmg scaling and might not be worth (dont know if you took that into account)
