I’ve been NC for a year and it makes me feel awful because she loves my kid and was always great with him but seeing her took a toll on my own mental health. I still have pretty bad mental health issues, but no longer are they fueled by that circumstance. 

When I told her I was engaged she became almost violently angry and told me I should’ve just texted her because she didn’t like surprises, but when I told her in person that I was pregnant she was nothing but joy. She told everyone the gender despite my very clear explanation that I wasn’t revealing that to anyone and when I called her out on it she just said ‘whoops’. 

I had to write a list of all of the things that were psychologically traumatizing because otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to maintain NC. I didn’t get any apologies when I told her my feelings prior to NC, instead I received a ‘grow up’ and ‘I can’t believe you’re still holding grudges’. 

Nparents aren’t always bad, if they were I don’t think most of us would have trouble with crawling back and trying to reconcile or gain some sort of love or attention even if it’s very clear we will only be given a pebble of it every so often.

In all honesty I have just taken to the view point that if I am in fact the toxic one than I am doing her a favor by stepping out of her life, it’s probably not the healthiest view but it helps me through the moments of self-doubt.

BipolarReddit,eq4fbwd,t1_eq3am62,1559775626.0,"Thank you! There was a couple semesters where I withdrew because my mental health was awful and I needed to preserve my gpa, and I took a year off after I had my kid but I’m glad I ended strong"
BipolarReddit,eq3j906,t1_eq3j2z9,1559757004.0,I honestly am not going to get a lot of job opportunities with my degree in art so I’m going to take more classes this fall
BipolarReddit,eq3h3ag,t1_eq2pvdj,1559755807.0,"Art, but I took a lot of math and science because I was filling Pre-Med requirements which I think I’m going to do again in the fall"
breakingmom,ep7tr8u,t1_ep5cdq0,1559086236.0,"I too suffer from RBF, it was glorious during pregnancy plus I’m tall and I wear clothes that aren’t fitted so it was hardly noticeable"
insaneparents,ep68njy,t3_btykq3,1559065977.0,"I hate being a parent, my kid is a lot and I often think about running away. I think what crosses the line is placing the blame on the kid, kids are supposed to be assholes until they are taught otherwise and they didn’t consent to being born they just were. Even with all my issues I would never even consider hurting my kid"
BipolarReddit,eouai97,t1_eotifjq,1558861102.0,"Yeah, I ended up feeling ok before the appointment so thankfully didn’t ask to be admitted.  He was giving me 2 weeks because of the suicide risk, but he just upped it to 4 weeks because I went off one of my meds because the pharmacy kept fucking it up every single time."
insaneparents,eos0517,t1_eon04zp,1558815600.0,I mean you’re not supposed to leave a baby on a changing table unattended and if there is still poo you probably can’t put them in the crib or let them loose BUT you best believe I would rather wipe that poo onto my clothes before I put it near my mouth
insanepeoplefacebook,eol9iv9,t1_eoizybb,1558667492.0,I tried and got told it might be possible if I received my partners permission...the whole process is incredibly patronizing
bipolar2,eojuae7,t3_bs2bwf,1558642984.0,"My kid is very young and was an accident from before I knew I was bipolar...it fucking sucks, especially the first year with the sleep deprivation and constant energy needed. I regret having a kid, don’t get me wrong you will likely love your child more than anything in the world but the mental/emotional cost is extremely high. I worry about the possible damage I’ve already caused, and his dad is constantly telling me how much his mom fucked him up as a kid by looking grumpy and depressed all the time. I feel like I can barely manage to do bare minimum"
BipolarReddit,eoj3akw,t1_eoi0ijp,1558632372.0,I hope it goes well for you
BipolarReddit,eoj39mt,t1_eoijlin,1558632361.0,"Right now I don’t even know if my doctor has written a diagnosis, he is treating it like bp2 and we’ve briefly talked about how it makes sense but I think he’s been working his way around officially labeling it as such because before this I was planning on trying to go to medical school."
BipolarReddit,eoj2xfi,t1_eoic0ee,1558632204.0,"I don’t honestly think it will come to that, one of the major events that led to this episode was finding out my ex was having affairs with his employees at his store. I don’t want custody of my kid at all but I’m worried that if I do get out of this episode I WILL regret it. Thanks for your input!"
BipolarReddit,eoj2gf6,t1_eoi6uqc,1558631988.0,"You’re probably right, I just know that if I do get a time out alone the results won’t be good and I will need to be hospitalized but I won’t ask for help at that point. It’s like schrodingers depression and it sucks balls."
BipolarReddit,eoj0ip4,t1_eoijlin,1558631045.0,I unfortunately live in a rinky dink town so that’s not a thing
