ExplodingHeadSyndrome,fnh1i1g,t1_fnh14jb,1586952258.0,Yeah i experienced it about 2 months ago i guess. I also was unable to move my body and obviously had a high frequency sound(like when someone gets hit on the head in the movies) but no visuals. Are you also unable to move your body? It lasts about 2-4 mins for me. It is absolutely terrifying when it happenes. When i was 10 it scared the shit out of me. And nobody in my family had it. When did you first have it?
depression,fngtkdj,t1_fngpimv,1586944438.0,"I have the same trust issues situation i guess. Never thought about it like that. Also i have social anxiety because when i go into a room having a lot of people or people who i don't that well, i feel really awkward and feel like they are gonna insult me. Also have been dumped by ""friends"", who bullied me and even spread rumours about me like i cheat etc. I had some great friends after that but my insane brain tried to make me feel like they are just using me. Also it made feel like i have to suffer because if i made friends, i wouldn't be able to succeed.(sound crazy now) But i would get this feeling that it is something unusual. Like i should back and watch yt videos and browse reddit. I guess maybe it is because my brain got too comfortable to being depressed."

AsianParentStories,fnelaqt,t3_g10p6o,1586891395.0,"I had almost the same story that you did. My parents are narcissists and delusional. I was also bullied severly and all that. You shouldn't be ashamed of yourself, your parents are telling you all that. Your parents are twisting the narrative and painting yourself was weak, not good enough, ungrateful. But your parents believe system is just too delusional . The way they constantly abuse you and then think you should be grateful to them. You need to protect your mental health, you owe it to yourself. Their harmful believes and behavior are ruining your life. No good parent behaves that way. It is true that they came overseas for a good life but that doesn't mean they can use that to treat you like shit. You deserve much much better than that. I would recommended for you to tell them about your life as less as possible and maybe slowly reach into NC or just don't tell anything that can  be used against you. Distance yourself as much as possible. You will find that life gets pretty easy after that."

I thought i would start playing sports but my anxiety crushed me every time. At last i became numb to everything. I tried to play and even played some sports for some times but even when someone got a little mean, i would just get upset. Obsess over it in my free time, and would quit. Although i would say that some other things improved but they maybe because of age. Also i get very anxious when i am near large groups of people. Just curious i used to puke all the time before going to hostel, also my eyes would become watery automatically. Also i had very apathetic parents who never took me to any doctor for anything."
depression,fme4nob,t1_fme1bg6,1585989178.0,"Lol. When i told my parents they were like you don't have depression. You just have a very sad personality and were like this since childhood(imo 2 grade). You are just faking it.

That really made me insane, i thought maybe i was faking it. Maybe i just want attention. Because in my mind my issues were nothing. One of my cousins dad is an alcoholic. Although i got checked and the therapist i talked to sent me to a psychiatrist who prescribed me some drugs. Then she said i needed both drugs and therapy. Although she never clearly said what i had. The thing even after that they said the same thing as above. And all my opinions of them were proven true. Even after this they didn't believe me. They also said that if you take these drugs you would have a depression for a long time. It still don't know about the last statement. Everything else was bullshit. Maybe if they had let me go, they couldn't justify the crap they pulled on me."

But if you just wanna lose weight. You have got to make a routine. Because if you don't, you are gonna gain your weight very soon again.( happened with me) Also if you can you should keep fruits with you all the time and keep them where you can easily see them, so that you can effortlessly eat them. Also make a routine which is achievable and try to make it as effortless as you can. Start with small steps. Maybe record your eating habits. And try to improve them each day.  Now you can scare your family members by telling them all the good things about obesity. Or just watching a video on a loud volume about it. Or maybe you can just ask them to give you healthy food. Whatever you gotta do. Try to replace every unhealthy item you eat, one by one. And when you are eating, eat slowly and try to enjoy food, chew it a lot and don't watch tv while eating."

depression,fi4ljmd,t1_fi3i6y6,1582143617.0,"I know that we aren't special. That there is no intrinsic meaning in anything we do. There is no point in our living or dying. IMO we can find meaning in anything as long as we feel respected, we are contributing to something, have value, loved or supported. Or do something we like. I think that cooperation and curiousity are the main reason for our modern civilization. We like to think that our ""thinking part"" of the brain is incharge but in reality everything our limbic system is incharge(emotions, arousal and memories) Said by elon musk on joe rogan. And there will always be problems but we should try to make a difference in whatever way we can.

I don't think most people are trying to justify their existence. People love each other because that's what our limbic system wants. That's how we are made. I believe there is something beautiful about human collaboration.(Unlike octopuses who live in isolation) Big pharma gave free medicine to help with parasites in Africa. When people love each other or have their meaningful work these useless questions don't matter. Death of the universe is inevitable by heat death. So it is all about the journey. How advanced as a civilization can we get. How far can we explore. We are curious after all. We should preserve our consciousness. We are the dominant species of our planet and we should utilise this. Earth will die one day so we should try preserve our civilization and our knowledge.

I don't think destroying the planet has anything to do we with loving others. It has to do with unsustainable use of harmful natural resources, countries denying climate change for financial gain, countries hell bent on leading the world rather than making a better world. People preferring money over our future.

Many people don't realize this but what we do isn't totally based on what's happening in front of us it is based on our life experiences(the people with talk to, the people whom we love), our preconceived notions, even the food we eat and the activities we do(exercises, yoga etc.), the books we read etc. Therefore we should try to focus more and more on each improving each aspect. We should try to foster mutually beneficial relationships. 

Causes of depression by John Harri 

1. The first main cause of depression is a disconnect from meaningful work – something that’s alleviated when employees feel empowered.

2. The second cause of depression is a disconnect from other people. The solution is to foster mutually beneficial relationships.

3. The third cause of depression is a disconnect from meaningful values, so don’t lose sight of what’s important. 

4. The fourth cause of depression is a disconnect from childhood trauma.

5.The fifth cause of depression is a disconnect from status and respect. You need to feel that people see and value you.

6. The sixth is disconnect from nature.

7. The seventh reason is a disconnection from a hopeful and secure future.

8. Genes and brain changes

If we can resolve the above issues we can deal with depression. But remember that when in depression it is always necessary to get help. I don't think anyone can do this alone. I know doing anything in depression is nearly impossible but i just wanted to share my point of view with you guys.

Intermittent fasting, nearly eliminating sugar, eating almonds, cashews, walnuts, curcumin , reserveratrol (good for brain according to sandrine thuret a neurologist) helped me in my depression before a relative fat shamed me and i slowly and slowly got stuck back into my old habits. I guess i cared TOO MUCH for what others think of me."
