He worked nights, slept all day, and used his free time to golf. I’m proud of you for pulling through for your kids and yourself. I’ve had serious conversations with my fiancé already about splitting house work and overall duties and explained that women in this position are more likely to take their own life or even leave/divorce.

raisedbynarcissists,fqhh5e5,t3_giou5l,1589376896.0,"DHS/CPS/Social Workers all around struggle to be effective. Many times they are assigned far too many cases for one person. It’s possible your social worker is seeing your situation as less dire considering they literally enter homes where grandfathers rape infants. Furthermore, even with all the proper reporting it takes a LONG time to genuinely get an effective order put in place. I worked at a daycare in a poor neighborhood and I cannot tell you how many things I reported and all it did was further “build a case.” They “try” to document and collect as much evidence for a stronger trial in the meantime subjecting children to still live with their abusers. In states like mine, Iowa, governors are trying to further make CPS/Social Work privatized, which would only make matters worse. :("
changemyview,fqg14jo,t3_gigi2i,1589335762.0,It’s intentional. Aristotle explains in The Politics that tyrannical government use two party systems to keep the people divided and unprogressive.

I’m sorry to hear about your coworkers, I often felt the same way after work but thankfully no one ever personally told me i was “too much” so it was more of how i perceived their reaction to my mood and i was able to calm down by reminding myself, I’m not a mind reader so I could be projecting OR remembering I hardly remember shit people do so it’s likely they aren’t thinking twice about it. I recently ordered this Dialectical Behavioral Therapy work book and it’s on the way still but this therapy approach is one worth reading into for you! Like you, I’m unable to just move past emotions or understand them so this book allows you to integrate your split thinking into a wholesome mindset.

And don’t get me wrong haha i definitely was able to get my shit done but i would take forever to start and doing it usually annoyed me bc I wasn’t smoking. I mostly just hated how dirty my house was though bc if things didn’t have a deadline and it wasn’t affecting anyone besides myself, I didn’t do it. I was a master of just saying “after I smoke I’ll do it” or “after this trap nap” lmao"
BPD,fq9cr9g,t3_ghfuza,1589193862.0,"I was like this for the past 4 years. I smoked like 3 blunts a day (an eighth A DAY) until I switched to wax which i blew through 1g carts in about 5 days. Eventually I got tired of the cycle where I felt sad and empty unless I was high, because when the weed wore off it was evident it wasn’t helping. The breaking point for me was when I was practically anorexic bc my tolerance was so high I couldn’t smoke enough weed to get hungry. I also grew the inability to sleep 8 hours a night because I would wake up once the weed wore off. Lastly, it made doing everything harder. Working out, cleaning the house, yard work, my school work, etc. all of those things I realized make me feel more accomplished and genuinely happy when i completes them and weed was standing in my way of being proactive and genuinely content with my daily activities. I know this isn’t easy but slowly push yourself to sit with those emotions for 5 minutes before sparking, then 15, 30 min, even push yourself to an hour and maybe tell yourself “if you clean the bathroom you can smoke” or something like that. I’m not saying you should quit but smoking weed all day every day isn’t ideal for anyone. (Also not trying to imply you do, but I’m sure others may) It’s much better when only consumed at most once a day but I grew to quit buying weed and now i only smoke when I’m with my smoking friends and they smoke me up. They know i don’t smoke or buy but they love to offer so I don’t mind bc it’s more social now than a dependency."

She brings it up at least bi-weekly. After my wedding I’m going no contact bc she’s offering to pay for my wedding so fuck it, I’ll use her money and dip out.

You really can’t do anything even when you try your hardest.” School work was half the battle when I was struggling with self esteem. I’m sorry you’re experiencing the same thoughts.

However, if you couldn’t tell by my name, ya girl loves to smoke. I often feel frustrated attending graduation parties, weddings, holidays, KIDS birthday parties even and alcohol is always present but I would rather get high but smoking weed at any of those would stir controversy, why? Weed doesn’t effect you AT ALL like alcohol and most smokers don’t act as impulsively as people who are drunk. Something to consider :)"
RationalPsychonaut,fnnmclf,t3_g2ic1b,1587095798.0,"This reminds me of when I had my first solo trip ever and I recall snacking on walnuts but when I bit into the first walnut every single bite, tasted like the universe. I was able to recognize and appreciate the taste of the tree, the amount of water and sunlight put into a single walnut, and overall just the ability to sit back and actually savor it. In a corny way I felt like the universe sitting back consuming itself. It was beautiful and eye opening."
introvert,fnh1wl1,t1_fnffg49,1586952603.0,"Exactly and empathy goes towards the sender of messages too. That is why i didn’t suggest engaging in full conversation simply bc it might hurt their feelings. No, i said have enough empathy to at least recognize the fact that they thought and cared enough to reach out. Don’t even respond to any of the content in the message just say “I’m busy.” I think you should apply your last message to your self to be honest bc i see it both ways but it seems you do not."
introvert,fnf8kwl,t1_fnea48d,1586903399.0,"I’m not sure how I lacked empathy? Lol i recognize they didn’t want to respond but i was suggesting a way to avoid double texts or people sending back “???” Bc the post, to me, was high lighting how that was even MORE annoying. I will admit though i do not have empathy for people who want to complain and feel validated about their problems but fail to take proper action to set boundaries or do something about said problem. No one is a mind reader, if you want someone to fuck off simply communicate that. It’s not that hard lol."
introvert,fndwm38,t3_g0xg5f,1586878849.0,"Other people have feelings and as annoyed as you may be, they took the time to think about YOU, to try and connect with YOU, and ultimately if you don’t even respond it seems like their effort/love goes unnoticed. So try not to get so irritated and perhaps appreciate the gesture and just communicate openly that you are busy and will get back at a later time. Empathy never hurts :)"
BPD,fndutbm,t3_g0puu9,1586877898.0,"Life is only as meaningful as you make it. I used to definitely feel the same way, and even experience similar suicide ideation. It wasn’t until my sister committed suicide that I realize it was NEVER an option after being on the other end of it. But overall, psychedelics have helped me the most. I’m much more self aware and when I’m in a funk I’m able to call myself out on it and just say to myself “so you want to sit and make yourself miserable or you ready to move on and have a good day” ultimately it is all in our head and we essentially create our realities."

My family dog passed away the other day and I’ve found going on walks, cooking, cleaning, reading, etc keeps my mind off of it. We are ALL here for you!"
Makeup,fnbp4xi,t3_g0o748,1586819580.0,I found better results by making sure I exfoliated if I REALLY want my foundation to look good. It helps a ton to remove all the dead skin. To be honest though I’ve tried a ton of different dewy and luminous foundations but frankly I think it’s just the ingredients. When I use expensive brands like dermalogica for my primer and foundation I don’t have any cakey-ness.
politics,fnbk9sw,t1_fnbjp80,1586817026.0,It sucks we have to pick the lesser of two evils but it seems to me you identify a little more liberal than conservative and if you at ALL want the democratic presidency please recognize we are already up against the electoral college. The Democratic Party cannot afford to deviate from our candidate.
RationalPsychonaut,fn4ps57,t3_fzbw0s,1586646356.0,"Plato summed it up best, “I know that I know nothing.” People who are genuinely “woke” (don’t usually use that word lol) but they simply recognize they need to put their pride/ego to the side and accept they know nothing and control very little of what we experience. People who claim to know it all are typically those who know the least, and those who know the most claim to know nothing. It’s called the Dunning-Kruger Effect.

Psychedelics,fn46pdu,t3_fzg4gu,1586635165.0,You stepped out of your ego for a moment. If they made fun of you they’re the assholes. I dance literally in my underwear in my living room at 3 am during my trips with my dog and my fiancé never makes me feel weird. Get better friends or communicate how they make you feel.
offmychest,fn37z94,t3_fyy0ga,1586615034.0,"I used to feel the EXACT same way until one day a very wise person asked me, “so if you were offered a chance to gamble on an entirely new body and face would you do it?” And immediately I said no because as shitty as it is to say I was able realize I have definitely seen much uglier people. I’m not a vain person anyways and don’t care to compare to others in general but it’s all relative so don’t get down on yourself. :)"

socialskills,fn2ky1x,t1_fn2k7o6,1586592864.0,"I have not given up and I’m not feeling hopeless either. I was just hoping to highlight that the narrative of the op, to me, was reading that adverse effects were poor excuses. I felt there could have been more empathy, or at least a follow up on those who face bigger obstacles with self esteem besides basic insecurities. I just felt it could be less patronizing. I personally speak with a talk therapist but frankly the best therapy for me is psychedelics. Shedding the ego, and getting up close and personal to my subconscious allows me to dig up what I’ve suppressed for years among many other fascinating things and then I address it in talk therapy.  Best of luck on your journey."
socialskills,fn2kn9f,t1_fn2kff6,1586592533.0,I was referring to the comment i replied to. They said something about working to reverse trauma.
socialskills,fn2jl3c,t1_fn2iujv,1586591384.0,"I also disagree. You cannot reverse trauma, it’s near impossible to control yourself from thinking about trauma too. Through therapy and several other therapeutic experiences I have had I am constantly reminded my battles come from messages I learned starting as an infant and those are stored in the subconscious which we have no control of or much access too and it makes up 95% of all thought and behavior. It’s entirely hard to reverse messages you simply are unaware of."
socialskills,fn2fyaq,t3_fyv2uo,1586587629.0,"I partly disagree. The part where the author claims “some bad things from childhood have an effect but overall it’s just an excuse.” We form our subconscious by the age of 7 based on the experiences we have. For people like me who were raised by narcissists, have innately learned to speak to themselves in the same way. It’s not an excuse, the reality is 95% of our thoughts are unconscious. I just feel that claiming adverse childhood effects are excuses is really a disservice to people who suffer complex-ptsd or experience personality disorders as a result of endless abuse and neglect."
Parenting,fn2dw5x,t3_fywh0k,1586585637.0,"When you said she caught him at 3 am I was terrified. As an adult YouTube queue turns CREEPY past like 1 am.

AskWomen,fmn2ltz,t3_fvzp3y,1586216893.0,Quit reaching out first/initiating all interaction and you will soon realize you were the only one maintaining the relationship all along. It’s a hard process and you must be willing to accept that if your friends are in fact not reaching out you must accept it and respect your friendship for what it really is or b.) set standards for friendship and stick to them.
offmychest,fml7kxc,t3_fvpu2g,1586180548.0,"I hope you know they ARE OBLIGATED to tell you. It’s ILLEGAL not to disclose that to a sexual partner and you may be subject to charges, fines, or other penalties. STD/STI have some potential to be deadly especially those that are non-symptomatic and cause ovarian/cervical cancers or infections thus the need for legal implications."
socialskills,fmhhc5b,t3_fv7ekg,1586080152.0,"You’re not alone! I used to consider myself an extrovert, like you, and I would now say I’m more of an extroverted introvert. My best friends from college and myself hung out every day, and even took a lot of the same classes, and practically lived together. Post graduation it was hard to get used to being 2+ hours from each other and having jobs and schedules. None have kids or are married yet but I’ve had to learn to accept the relationship for what it is, if it’s meaningful enough to me. That unfortunately means lowering your expectations but your partner is right, they do have A LOT going on. If you are seeking a possible way to reconnect perhaps find something to do that’s inclusive of their children. Nothing makes people feel more loved than people who love their kiddos. Otherwise you could just put your heart out there and say you really miss them and if you can’t see each other right now perhaps FaceTime would suffice. Best of luck"
raisedbynarcissists,fmcf5xz,t1_fmbstj3,1585944486.0,This is literally me too. My mom to this day denies that my underwear had holes. My sister and I are 22 months apart and we shared underwear with holes for years. But obviously my jeans were $100 each and everything on the exterior was name brand because image was everything to my mom. -_-
relationship_advice,fmas55w,t3_ftyvop,1585905653.0,"I hope you are able to find a way to communicate this to him, just in a more productive manner. Find ways to make your point essentially that you have concerns about the grocery budget and how long it’s lasting in reality. Perhaps he agrees and would be willing to pay more. Your tone overall (albeit being interpreted through text) doesn’t come off as very endearing and I hear that you are stressed and needing more help and appreciation. But when we are just trying to communicate, connect, feel heard, and loved all those become harder when we allow our ego to involve itself."
raisedbynarcissists,fmaq8tv,t1_fmabufz,1585903496.0,"I experience this too! I have buyers remorse almost any time I spend money, and I constantly try to reason/rationalize myself into not spending money. I only got toys or clothes if it was Christmas or my birthday and as a 22F I never buy myself clothes or make up or anything personal because I’m used to it being “special.”"
socialskills,fmaq259,t3_ftsis8,1585903289.0,"Used to have a lot of the same issues. Learning more about self awareness will help you gauge social situations. You can read books, watch YouTube series, get therapy, but I found the most effective tools for me were psychedelics. Self reflection and looking at myself and my life through differing perspectives always brings more self awareness. If you’re scared of your own feelings and “hate crying” please know the experience may not be as fun for you due to emotional immaturity/lack of self awareness."
nosurf,fm7i72x,t3_fszkoh,1585827878.0,"So disappointing. I think it’s a lot of the reason everything is so political now without any change. Everyone is a keyboard warrior and says whatever they want because they can do it remotely without facing the repercussions. Whereas politics may be taboo in person. Also, most people feel like a strongly worded post is contributing to positive political change when it’s not. Change only happened when people got together and demanded love and respect for each other, not slaughter each other through screens."

Makeup,fjrven2,t3_femodj,1583590556.0,I’m kinda opposite lol. I like to do make up on other people because I’m much less critical of how everything looks on their face compared to my own. :)

I think people should try to see narcissism in a different light in the sense that most people with narcissism were raised by narcissists or parents who failed to give them connection and guidance. They have an extremely damaged inner child, the issue is they will never change unless they want to but even wanting to is a LONG road for them."

The worst part was when I quit taking them bc i didn’t know there were withdrawal symptoms. I was sweating, nauseous, anxious, crying constantly, and overall felt like shit physically and emotionally. You could try natural methods like 5htp, Rose Root Extract, St. John Worts, or lastly CBD."
