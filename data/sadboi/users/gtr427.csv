Simply put, she's a great character because of who she is even with everything else stripped away. She's still a fighter even without her arms and legs.

Showerthoughts,fpqy7pi,t1_fpqxkhx,1588835905.0,Do you think nobody noticed his electric car company or space program? He was in Iron Man 2 all the way back in 2010.
Showerthoughts,fpqxal7,t1_fpqwyu3,1588835065.0,"Elon has been an eccentric billionaire for at least a decade.

Edit: He sold PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002 and the Model S came out in 2012 so yeah he has been famous for quite a while."
Showerthoughts,fpqx6l2,t1_fpqwfph,1588834962.0,So he can't be a genuinely eccentric guy who happens to do shite things sometimes? Every single thing he does is for nefarious reasons? He runs a car company and a space company. *Of course* he's going to launch a car into space.

StarWarsEU,fpqw3of,t1_fppz9t7,1588833994.0,"It's a quote from the notoriously un-eloquent Lucas himself but I believe he got the idea for repeated themes and events from Wagner's *Ring* cycle (which is one of the most significant operas ever written), so people laugh at that line but miss that what he was going for was a rather sophisticated concept that is more than a hundred years old."
todayilearned,fpqhl23,t1_fpoh7lr,1588822971.0,"Hijacking this comment for a fun fact: Her name wasn't even Pocahontas, originally it was (Princess) Matoaka and then she changed it to Rebecca Rolfe when she married John Rolfe. Pocahontas means ""little wanton"" or ""playful one"".

Her 'secret' name was concealed from the English out of superstition and she only revealed it to them after she changed her name."
WeirdWheels,fpqfg31,t1_fposn81,1588821586.0,It did several test runs so it definitely works but I don't think they did anything with it other than do a couple laps of their test track.
saltierthancrait,fppbmnl,t1_fpopgku,1588799346.0,His T-16 is even visible in the movie! [While Luke is flying the toy model around it's sitting in the background just outside the archway.](https://external-preview.redd.it/bV7Gkx1UOEWlGnevvnzm2RpRZfLV_3g8GwiVQdaPBoE.jpg?auto=webp&s=926d5d9fa7c843884bdc9c801f944bf60f97e002) Even though it's obvious to me now I still never noticed it until someone pointed it out but it's just one more thing that establishes his piloting skills.
WeirdWheels,fpp2l2y,t3_genh58,1588794856.0,"This is a similar model (or even the same) to the vehicle the Doof Wagon was made from in Mad Max: Fury Road, for extra battlecar cred"
alitabattleangel,fpp21yr,t1_fpn4day,1588794595.0,"As far as I'm aware there's only one cut of the film, other than the theatrical and open matte versions which just have different aspect ratios. I just checked and this shot happens at exactly 1:35:37 into the movie."

saltierthancrait,fpmvegr,t1_fpmpjj4,1588742785.0,He was also Palpatine in season 2 of Rebels plus a bunch of other minor voices in various things and he was the voice and face of Galen Marek/Starkiller in Force Unleashed. He has so much Star Wars cred that his opinion can't simply be dismissed.
