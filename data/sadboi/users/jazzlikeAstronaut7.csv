BPD,fk668sl,t3_fgouvy,1583894563.0,I felt like this too until I found a friend who was just as negative as me. It works great. We talk shit all day and we both don't get sick of it lol. Just gotta find someone like yourself dude.
BPD,fk65qrw,t3_fgdaq3,1583894262.0,"yep. Been through so many relationships and every time it's either they cheat/lie, or I feel fucked anyways because of typical BPD mood swings/overthinking etc. I'm just gonna give up now lol. I'm empty when I'm single but at least I'm not so confused and at least there's no chance of someone leaving."
TooAfraidToAsk,fk63ca4,t3_fgp042,1583892857.0,Maybe it's a sign of wanting people to feel bad for you so you can get attention. You're probably just insecure. Happens to me sometimes too.
TooAfraidToAsk,fk637mm,t3_fgo0dg,1583892782.0,Start having friends over to have discussions and dinner parties. The more the merrier.

BorderlinePDisorder,exjqd4c,t3_ct7948,1566357271.0,"Usually bpd manifests in young children as chronic boredom. I had this as a kid and now it all makes sense lol. I think it has something to do with the emptiness. If you feel empty and lonely then all of life’s pleasures will seem pretty mundane and thus you will get bored. It overlaps with depression a lot.

Don’t you just love having bpd!! Lol"
BorderlinePDisorder,ex2wqbs,t3_cr7vtb,1565976534.0,I’m almost always in a rage after thinking of shit that hurt me. I still haven’t found ways to cope with it except endlessly thinking of suicide and distracting myself with random hobbies...
BPD,ewww1bx,t1_ewwc03d,1565836820.0,This.
BorderlinePDisorder,ewp6iaa,t3_cpgbb6,1565634510.0,"I do this too, I think it’s because we try to re live something to see where we went wrong, or to hold onto things that we lost...my suggestion is to literally throw all of it out, delete old pics, delete social media, etc. Live in the world not in your head or in the past."
NarcissisticSpouses,ewp2kmm,t1_ewg7sfi,1565632078.0,Sounds like his fear of closeness is extreme...I feel for you :( I told my ex that I still had a crush on him and he laughed in my face. Some people never change!
NarcissisticSpouses,ewg57zi,t1_ewg4xwi,1565374161.0,"In my opinion “killing them with kindness” works for even the worst of people. I would say to manage your expeditions first off (don’t expect him to become warm and fuzzy suddenly) but also try to be as nice and comforting as possible. Sit him down, take his hands, tell him you love him and think he’s amazing, and ask him to open up to you. Since they’re not psychopaths they do at least have some capacity for compassion and romance and trust. If you give it your best efforts to build trust with him he may slowly start to let you in. Try to have a nice cuddle session and open up to each other. This might do the trick to alleviate at least some tension between you two."
NarcissisticSpouses,ewg4dbj,t3_co51oe,1565373629.0,"My ex is the same way. He quickly becomes obsessed with people and then quickly hates them for no legitimate reason. The problem in my opinion is that narcissists have major insecurities and trust issues so they don’t like getting too close to anyone. They’re so afraid to get hurt. So they find every reason they can to push people away. They won’t ever be happy with you because they’re never happy with themselves. And unless you make them constantly feel happy about themselves, the’ll discard you and become cold monsters."
acne,ew5w2ru,t1_ew579ou,1565146595.0,Thanks! For some reason cetaphil BURNS my skin! So weird...eucerin is good though..thanks
acne,ew4lyd6,t1_ew4hjop,1565113438.0,It’s not that severe. Just 3-5 on my forehead. I’ve heard of that too I’m going to ask my derm about it. What’s your skincare routine? I hear African black soap is good.
AskWomen,eva3g0k,t3_cirnsn,1564337885.0,They all lie. It might just be a little white one. But they do it because confrontation gives them a headache. Men don’t like anything stressful or complex when it comes to social interaction. So they avoid through hiding and lying. I’ve never met one man who doesn’t lie at least a bit.

mentalillness,etsw4ca,t3_cd8n4f,1563157190.0,I have the same problem. I have BPD and everything makes me want to kill myself. But I do everything I’m supposed to in terms of therapy etc. the one thing that slightly helps me is doing something meaningful. Try to think of a goal you have and then work super hard towards that goal. It’ll give you purpose and self esteem.
BorderlinePDisorder,ets78tp,t1_etrobip,1563138242.0,Wow “attention and comfort but our conversations lead me to feeling disappointment.” That’s literally me. Thanks for being so empathetic!! Xo

BorderlinePDisorder,eticjop,t1_ethkrv3,1562846005.0,He will likely be compassionate if you tell him. It’s rare that opening up to your partner will end in them being mad and leaving you. Just be honest with him
BorderlinePDisorder,ethk3hg,t3_cbj28t,1562817848.0,"I used to be so bad I would contact the girls and ask questions about anything I wanted to know. One time I found out my ex cheated on me with a guy (my ex was bicurious) and so I went and had sex with the guy the next day just to get revenge/because I was so jealous. It’s fucked. 

I’ve come a long way in the sense that I don’t act in my impulses anymore...but I still have them. Just try to remember that if your bf wanted the other girl over you then he’d be with the other girl."
BorderlinePDisorder,ethjouo,t3_cbq5tp,1562817494.0,So far it hasn’t worked for me. I’ve realized that you have to find someone who has the exact same values as you. BPD’s can’t settle or compromise. For example: being clingy and liking to text and call a lot. They need to like that too otherwise it won’t work. You gotta find someone who isn’t judge mental and knows you have BPD and is willing to stick around and deal with it. Someone compassionate and agreeable but still strong enough to not crumble under the pressure. It’s nearly impossible but not impossible imo.
BorderlinePDisorder,etfqsqt,t1_etfhxfn,1562775655.0,I mean like- obviously bpd’s want something more out of it which is why they’re usually always in a relationship/depending on someone

BorderlinePDisorder,et7iq30,t3_caa6cn,1562531981.0,"I think this is a hormonal thing. Something sciencey lol- basically it’s like when you cry. You release hormones (Seratonin I I think) so you always feel better after a crying fit. And there’s a psychological aspect to it too obviously. You’re essentially releasing bottled up stress so it’s no longer ruminating in your head. 

After similar episodes I always feel better and wonder why I was even that mad, and I think “life isn’t that complicated just chill dude.” But then slowly, everything boils up again..."
relationship_advice,et7gs5c,t1_et7glac,1562531007.0,I guess even though I’m 22 the problem is I feel like I have too many exes. Like even though I’m over them I still think about them all the time and only stop when I’m dating the next guy. I wish I could just go back in time and erase them all...
BorderlinePDisorder,esn8kfc,t1_esn8e1r,1562125355.0,"Yeah I felt almost bad for her and angry with her at all the people who bullied her. 

I don’t manipulate on purpose but I’ve definitely found myself trying to date the most masculine man in the room and then finding his weaknesses and prying into them just so I can feel better. I don’t notice I’m doing it but I always realize later. I’m not sure if I have NPD instead sometimes. I know BPD and NPD have similar traits though."
BorderlinePDisorder,esn8ca6,t3_c8isuj,1562125187.0,"I’m like this. I always want it from a guy, usually my bf if I have one. And if I don’t have one, I want it from an ex. When my friends or other thirsty guys try to give me attention I just get annoyed and angry."

And i’d be too grossed out to torture people physically. But emotionally? Like all the blackmailing with her fake “cancer” etc. that is totally me. I do it without even noticing and then feel pathetic and ashamed afterwards. Idk I just fully related to her emotions. Even how she wasn’t focused at work because she was so caught up in getting revenge on people who betrayed her and abandoned her. I do this all the time. I’m in therapy but I can’t help my feelings a lot of the time."
BorderlinePDisorder,es6ctnz,t1_es65x2s,1561646332.0,Yes I heard about these things! I’m gonna try the dunking my face in cold water thing and see if that helps.

relationship_advice,eqhbxdu,t1_eqhbocx,1560054241.0,Yeah I’m starting to realize that. I guess it’s hard for me because I’m not used to being rejected by guys. I’ve never had someone dig into my character like he has. Most men have cheated on me so it was easy to blame them for our problems and break ups. But this time I share much more blame than usual which I’m not used to. It’s making me more introspective but as a consequence also more insecure. I guess I just have to accept that I’m not gonna be everyone’s type as you said.

I know you're still in shock and in a lot of pain but if she doesn't want to stick by you through hard times and doesn't want to give you the time of day to break it off in person, then you probably shouldn't be with her anyways.
