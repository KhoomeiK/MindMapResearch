breakingmom,fhrkg1t,t1_fhrith7,1581828782.0,"There are more factors at work here- he was treated for ADHD as a child and he was bullied about having to take medication to the point he was beaten by a neighbor kid with a baseball bat giving him permanent brain damage (difficulty converting short term to long term memory). The last straw was when they went on a field trip and another child nearly succeeded in pushing my partner through the window of a 160ft tower. His mother homeschooled him after that, which honestly didn’t make anything better, considering that she was a pretty shit mother who fed him nothing but peanut butter and jelly while she spent all her $ on antiques.

His family is also the unfortunate religious types who believe that taking medication for certain conditions is “meddling in God’s affairs”. So, the deep seated shame he has been bred with for most of his life are main factors in him being afraid to get help. It’s a miracle he’s even to the point of admitting he *has* anxiety and depression over the 2 years we’ve been together, which takes a lot for him to even say. 

One can’t overcome that kind of inbred shame in a couple years. It was so deep in him he literally used to vomit if he took communion because he felt he was so unworthy he could hardly step inside a church. The way his family treated him and still treats him makes it harder for him to fight for himself. 

It’s the same mentality that a woman who has lived with domestic abuse has, except this is in a man who has been emasculated in almost every way- his mother openly complained he wasn’t a girl, his father called him a loser every time he saw him, and he didn’t have any friends except the ones whose parents made them play with him. 

He is also an assault survivor, which for (especially a conservative) male contributes even more to shame and trauma. So, not being healthy is understandable. 

I wasn’t ready or able to treat my conditions until I had been diagnosed for nearly 2 years because of finances, and other factors. I’m the first to admit that I was a freaking monster when I was manic and untreated. I think the only reason I even held on by a thread is because I hated addiction so much bc of my family that I never touched anything like that. 

No one is perfect, Lil_MsPerfect (I’m assuming that handle is sarcastic 😉). We all have brokenness in us; it’s just a matter of figuring out what we can and cannot handle. I learned a lot from my failed marriage to my daughter’s father, and my friendships- enough to tell the difference between someone who really doesn’t gaf, and someone who does and just isn’t ready to take the plunge because of fear and shame. My love is the latter, and I know this because he wouldn’t have admitted he has anxiety and depression if he wasn’t. It’s jut really hard to see that slow process of realization and knowing that he could feel so much more fulfillment and contentment out of life if he stopped giving in to fear."

(Bipolar Mood Disorder type 2, PTSD, severe anxiety, and depression). I can’t tell you how difficult that level of care is to manage while being in a single parent household and employed full time. 

That’s why it gets so frustrating when he refuses to do anything about his symptoms that I’m supposed to just shut up about and deal with, as long as I am treating mine. I’d also like to note that my daughter *also* is now seeing 3 providers for her therapy considering all she’s been through, so literally the only person in the little family we are creating whose symptoms are untreated are his. 

If it goes any further after he finds a job that gives him insurance, if he asks the question, I’m afraid I’m going to have to really look closely or, even worse, put a condition on saying yes. :( and I don’t want to, but I also know what it’s like growing up with a family who doesn’t treat their mental illnesses, and what that can look like.

It is also illegal.

Needless to say that interview didn’t last very long. But I also turned around and reported that to the BBB and the labor board. I got an apology call a few days later, and they asked if I wanted a second interview, and I told them “No, because regardless if I have kids or not, you attempted to discriminate, and I don’t want to be part of a team where that kind of culture is so prevalent you’re comfortable in revealing that during interviews.” 

I put a yelp complaint on the company too. 

Before that, I had the unfortunate experience of being fired from a job after taking 8 non-consecutive days following my child being sexually assaulted at her daycare, to find childcare, go to court hearings, meet with advocates, therapists, doctors, detectives, psychiatrists (needed some SERIOUS anxiety meds that a regular doctor wouldn’t prescribe) and my attorney.

I want to clarify my information about funeral assignments- if your moms job had insurance and there’s a policy, don’t tell the funeral home until ***after*** you’ve selected your arrangements and settled on a price. At that point is when it’s safe to offer the policy as an assignment, but do it only for the price of your arrangements. ***if the policy is for more than the price of the arrangements *****don’t*****tell the funeral home the face value/amount of the policy*** 

Be sure to read the contract before you sign it, and call the insurance company before the funeral home sends it with the total for the funeral home bill; tell them (the insurance company) if there is any discrepancy when they get the documentation for the assignment, to call you straight away, along with what the exact amount of the services will be. 

Sometimes the bill  *legitimately* could exceed the policy, but the funeral home will be more flexible with arrangements if they know at least some of it is paid upfront. In that case, it’s ok to authorize the insurance company to take the “full face value” and give it to the funeral home.

There might be a fee for the funeral home to help you make an assignment/claim, but hey, if it helps pay, it helps pay.

breakingmom,fe0jr88,t3_encs9x,1578814565.0,"I spent two years of my childhood homeless, and I can fully attest that your account of the conditions in homeless shelters are 100% accurate.

I’ve been homeless with my daughter since April. I lost my job for “attendance issues” when I took off 10 non-consecutive days to care for my daughter after she was molested at daycare- she was 5 and I’m a single mom, WTF was I supposed to do????? Court dates, lawyers, therapists for both of us, psychiatrist for me because that kind of stress on someone who is also part of that sad 1 in 3 and also has PTSD is not a good thing, trying to find child care, needing days off because my daughter was so afraid, couldn’t sleep, and was so confused she raged, and needed to stay home to calm down-who can blame her?! What was I supposed to do? so I got evicted when the $5000 I had ran out because the job market sucked where I was and I couldn’t find a high enough paying job to make it work in time. And we are just now in a position to move into a sublease owned by some nice Christians who want to help us, so we lucked out in regards to rebuilding my rental history. We are moving this Wednesday. That’s right folks, that’s 9 months of homelessness because some teenage boy couldn’t keep it in his pants as chose my 5 year old.

I know what you’ve been through-my daughter and I found a place at one really nice shelter after a domestic violence issue her dad decided to do (we are divorced, but I had nowhere else safe to take her to get her enrolled in kindergarten so we stayed with him for a bit- he threw a punch at me that missed and then threw a glass of water at my face- in front of our daughter- he was angry because he thought I slept too much-I had been putting in job applications until 3 AM and wasn’t able to wake up at 6 like usually did because of medication change issues, and he got mad).

We were really lucky that this DV Shelter was a house, that was cleaned everyday, had a clean kitchen, provided all toiletries and hygiene products, fresh towels, actual beds with actual bedding, PRIVATE ROOMS, a key code entry door, working washer and dryer, and that they stocked food everyday including milk, eggs, butter, cheese, bread, pasta & sauce, canned veggies, even frozen chicken breast. But this is a rarity in the world of homeless shelters. We have been couch (and hotel once I found a job) surfing since September, Sometimes living in places where I wouldn’t have considered but for the fact the shelters are worse. 

I have been driving my daughter an hour to school and then 45 minutes to work, and then the round trip back again just to keep her in the same school so she has some stability. All so I could avoid going into any other shelter in the area, because I’ve been to them all as a kid, and I’ve volunteered at them once I was adopted out of that situation, and I’m telling ya, those places haven’t changed at all. 

In the middle of this, my boyfriend (he was in the middle of getting his degree on cyber security and was close to going homeless himself because of student debt, so he couldn’t in good faith try to provide for us, he didn’t want to see us suffer by having hope only to possibly go homeless again) and I got pregnant, and then I miscarried at 8 weeks 3 days. All while homeless, having just barely found a job, and trying to keep it together for my daughter to get the Justice and the therapy she deserves to make some kind of recovery from this trauma.

Things happen. If you don’t have wealth, or literally $10-$15k in savings just as a buffer, and you have 2-4 Bad Things ™️ happen in the span of 2 or 3 months, you can lose everything *so effing fast**.

Assistance,fe0e8xt,t3_en99g5,1578811674.0,"I was 13 when my dad died at 36 years old of a drug overdose. I’m so sorry for your loss. 

I’ve worked in the death/insurance industry for 4 years now, including death claims at a Fortune 100 insurance company (Mutual of Omaha), and life insurance customer service for Transamerica Life Insurance Company. I currently work at a smaller insurance company’s tech startup/subsidiary building online storefronts for funeral homes, which means I’m very familiar with funeral home goods, services, regulations, practices, and basically the whole kit and caboodle.

I can’t donate money, and I don’t know exactly what area you live in, but I want to help you by giving some pointers about funerals, funeral homes and their processes, and insurance claims/other benefits to help. I’m 29, and you’re 20 and dealing with a horrific loss, and I don’t want some funeral home taking advantage of you due to your age, and being in a hard situation, because while there are some really kind and nice funeral directors out there, there are also some pretty shady ones. I’ve seen all kinds of stuff working in this industry and I don’t want you to get hurt anymore than you already are 💔

1- MONEY. I can’t donate to your gofundme, but I do know this: If your mother was currently employed for more than 90 days, call the employer and ask if they had a policy for her. Most employers will have at least $5k-10k of life insurance for their workers, at no cost to the employee, as a fringe benefit. You would just have to call the proper benefits department to start a claim. It can take a while for most insurance companies to pay them, but it’s at least a start to go down financially that if it doesn’t pay for services now, it can help you and your siblings later with other expenses (I’m really sorry to tell you this, but there are a LOT of hidden fees and expenses surrounding a death, it’s absolutely ridiculous).

2-FUNERAL HOMES/SERVICES- ***DO NOT*** tell the funeral home if there is any life insurance policy, even from an employer.  if you find a policy at your moms employer that you can claim on, call that company right away and tell them they are not to release any information to the funeral home without you having given consent for the funeral home to get that information from the insurance company on a separate phone call, and then only if you are also on the line when the funeral home speaks to the company. Funeral homes use a practice called “assignments”, which is helpful in some cases, but in others, in the hands of sales minded funeral directors, can be very damaging and unhelpful. 

A life insurance assignment is when a funeral home finds out the family has a policy, and then gets the information for the life insurance company, calls the insurance company’s claims line, and says they are placing an assignment- the assignment means no one else but the funeral home can be paid any amount from a life insurance policy before the funeral home is paid for the goods and services for a cremation or burial disposition, and all the merchandise and fees associated. Funeral homes will often say they’re taking a verbal assignment for the full value of the policy, and then you have to get the funeral home to sign off on releasing the assignment if you don’t want that insurance company to pay them the full value of the entire policy. So, easier to keep any policy you *might* unearth close to your chest with your other cards.

Funeral directors might try to sell you things you don’t need, so you have to be careful. I know this is a lot of info, but it would break my heart if you got taken advantage of.

In most states, you have the right to select either a direct cremation, ***or*** a direct burial of you just don’t want to have your mom cremated. 

——-Direct cremations—— are cheaper; you generally will be paying for basic services if funeral director & staff, transportation of your mom to the funeral home and from funeral home to crematory, a cremation fee, a fee for the use of a hearse or utility vehicle, and most funeral homes will include a “basic alternative container” which is basically a sturdy container that will encase your mom during the cremation, and a black temporary plastic urn. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROVIDE YOUR OWN URN/CONTAINER for your mom’s ashes. Depending on what you have handy, this is either very cheap, or can be free if you have something special at home you might use (a special wood momento box that mom had?). Some funeral homes will charge a fee to place the ashes in such a container, but it will likely be cheaper than any urn they sell at the funeral home. As long as the container can be sealed, you can use it. I’ve seen people use whiskey bottles, coffee cans, glass coca-cola bottles, baskets with a lid to put the temporary plastic container into, all kinds of things that fit the special person they loved who had passed away. 

——-An immediate burial——-doesn’t have to cost a lot of money. You can buy a casket from Walmart.com for a few hundred dollars that is sometimes cheaper than the ones you can find at a funeral home (which can range from $700-12,000+, it’s just insane how much caskets can be, but you don’t have to fall for that). This would be a “direct burial with container provided by the purchaser”. That is generally the cheapest option while electing for a burial. Some (actually most) cemeteries require you to buy a vault to place the burial casket in to prevent the ground from settling. You don’t have to buy a fancy vault. Ask for a concrete grave liner- use those words specifically, otherwise they’ll sell you a vault, and they are two different things (vaults Rend to be more expensive)-it gets the job done, and is the cheapest option if you’re doing a burial. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!!! When making your mama’s arrangements, you have the right to ask them for a full copy of their general price list, and any list of funeral, burial, and cremation packages they offer. The Federal Trade Commission requires funeral homes to disclose all their itemized pricing if a consumer asks them to. It’s federal and state law. Use that right. If the funeral home gives any pushback on letting you see their itemized general price list of goods and services, GO TO ANOTHER FUNERAL HOME. Just because a funeral home has your mom does not mean you have to use their services. Just be aware that if she is already in a funeral home’s care, if you decide not to use that funeral home, there *will* be additional charges at the one you’re leaving, and the one you’re going to. You don’t have to release your mom’s body to any funeral home until you’ve shopped around for the best deal.

If cremation is your aim, my recommendation is to look into a direct cremation society; they’re the fastest and cheapest. If you’re looking for an immediate burial, shop at two or 3 local funeral homes, and please please please be sure to ask them for a copy of their general price list to either be emailed or presented as soon as you walk into the arrangement conference.

If you have any questions PLEASE DM ME; I can’t help with $, but if I can save you a headache, I really want to.

When my partner lets down his guard enough to show his true feelings, he doesn’t call her “our daughter”. He calls her “my daughter”.  He doesn’t understand her sometimes (she’s *very* strong willed) but he loves her. He’s always done what is best for all of us.

Long story short, Nebraska absolutely SUCKS if you’re in a tight spot. Even if you’re a single mother and have had a sexual assault in your family. My partner is in about the same boat as you are. I ended up having to move to central Iowa to get myself on my feet, and I’m still homeless and fighting to overcome all this a year later; I found a job here, by the grace of God.

I know that Omaha has pretty limited resources, they’re kinda a-holes there about helping people, so honestly, Iowa is a bit friendlier. If you’re in the Omaha metro, might be worth your time to jaunt across the state line to CB to get better chances in Iowa. 

I know Counciltucky sucks, but it’s better than being destitute in NE. There’s so many jobs in the service industry in CB, and they’re more desperate for warm bodies than service in Omaha. If you’re not able/willing to do that, then if you’re in the Omaha metro, Alorica is almost always hiring; they might suck, and have a revolving door, but it’s a job, and will get the bills paid.

If you can drive a bit out of town to a rest stop, they do allow you to park for no more than 24 hours for resting. No one will bother you as long as you aren’t parked right in front of the building. These will oftentimes have free WiFi, and at least vending machines for coffee, drinks, and small snacks. 

Truck stops have showers you can buy, or you can sometimes apply for a discounted YMCA membership to shower and get exercise and sometimes hot meals. Sometimes if you talk to a church or temple they might grant you space in their parking lots. If you don’t get anywhere with Christians, try a Unitarian congregation, they have a tendency to be a bit more lenient. 

24 hour groceries, WalMart, or Targets are good places to park. You’ll need to keep a list of places that you can park, don’t spend the night in the same place more than once in a 7 day period. Vary it up so you don’t draw attention, especially in a big city. 

If you can’t get a place before winters end, then once spring comes by, you could look for a tent and there are public access lands where it is free to camp.

It’s hard to overcome the urge to isolate, but I promise, you’ll be glad if you do. 

If you’re not ready to seek that kind of help, then I’d recommend some things that help me in my journey with anxiety/PTSD/Bipolar Mood Disorder Type 2. 

1- Use the five minute rule. 
The principal here is that I can do anything for five minutes. Pick up some trash. Do dishes. Clean the toilet bowl. Take a 5 minute shower. Pick up laundry. Maybe put in a load of laundry. If you can do one thing for five minutes, maybe you can do five minutes more. But you *have* to give yourself grace and permission to stop at 5 minutes if you need to. Be kind to yourself. 

2- For anxiety, use the 5 Senses exercise. Intentionally list 5 things you like to hear, 5 things you like to see, smell, taste, touch. When you’re done, go and experience at least one of those things. Smell and touch are the most powerful senses, I often will make myself a cup of tea in a disposable cup so I don’t have to wash anything, just to smell it (I like the smell of Stash Double Spice Chai), and I’ll wrap myself in a soft blanket. I usually do drink it when it cools down, but the smell is just lovely.

3- Use the 4-7-8 breathing technique. Inhale 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. This will slow down your heart rate, and will do at least a little to relax you physically when things are getting out of hand.

Please, please, please be kind to yourself. A lot of people experience at least some of what you’re going through, you’re not alone.

Thank you for reaching out here- that takes courage. Please keep the community updated. ❤️"

One year, a family brought a make your own sandwich kit. Guys. It was literally a thing of pickles, a thing of mustard, some ketchup, and a loaf of $0.80 white bread. No meat hiding in the fridge. No cheese. Just the bread and some condiments. Budget friendly, but not the gift you want to choose.

Best gift there ever was: Someone borrowed a plastic T-Bone steak from their kid’s kitchen set, wrapped it up with a note that said “Find me in the fridge!” And sure enough, in the fridge was a porterhouse steak labeled “You found me!” Genius.

There was also the rubber chicken that got wrapped and hidden every year as a joke. The person who got it usually got a better gift at the end, because getting the chicken knocked you out of the game. 

I go to Target, buy a nice mug, then go to the grocery section and pick an assortment of candy, chocolate, tea, and those tiny bags of gourmet coffee, put it in a brown paper bag gift bag (the kind with the rope-like handles), tie the handles together with a pretty bow, put some pretty gold stick on letters that spell “Noel” or “Peace” or “Merry Christmas”, something of that nature- the I call it good.

This was all brought on by moving for jobs, changes in schedules, and situations we needed to get her out of in daycare, fast. 

Needless to say, I’ve seen the gambit from excellent, to just ok, to oh heck no when it comes to childcare. 

Lady, even for the first day, this is a Big Big Red Flag. 🚩That’s not appropriate for your child’s age, and is not a good indicator of how that daycare handles things. Even if they’re short staffed and not at ratio (which is an entirely different and licensing compliance concern), that should not happen.

I would speak with the room leader, let her know what you saw, and tactfully tell her that you don’t support the cry it out method, and you are concerned your child was allowed to cry for that long without being picked up or even spoken to. If she seems defensive, find new childcare. Your precious baby deserves better than that; usually when things like this happen, you’ll discover even more disturbing things as time goes on.

1- What were you taking (if anything) to treat your epilepsy before you had your daughter? I take some medications that are often used for epilepsy, but to treat mental health disorders. So I’m wondering if you’ve potentially got the absence of epilepsy medications that can also have been stabilizing your mood, coupled with Post-Partum Depression, compounded by a validly sucky situation.

2- Does your area have a train/public transport system? If so, since it sounds like things are tight, maybe you could apply to get a free (or heavily reduced cost) bus pass? My daughter always loved riding the bus! 

3- Who do you have near you that could come to see you? 

When I was pregnant with my first, I lost my job because they didn’t want to bother with FMLA for me, and I’d been there literally 11 months and was 5 months pregnant when they fired me- so, because money went to other bills, my car got repossessed. I had to walk nearly 2 miles to the closest bus stop to get to the closest grocery store, then walk back those two miles to carry the groceries home. 

Once we did get a hold of some money by chance (I got a check in the mail I hadn’t expected) we bought the first junker we could find, but it was the only car we had, and since I only worked part time, and my ex worked nights, guess who never got to leave and go anywhere (if you guess me, you’re right!)?

I’m bipolar 2, and I was diagnosed October 2017. 

I’m hypomanic, which means I don’t really swing high/happy much; and if I do, it’s mostly a tense upward swing, because it’s anxiety related. The hypomania is what separates bipolar 1 from bipolar 2. 

The mood swings are the most frightening thing; I’ve identified times I’ve cycled through depressed, to angry, to anxious, to calm, to happy in less than half an hour, with that type of cycle happening over several hours, adding in different emotions.

 And when the anxiety and being pressured builds up, it feels like I lose my composure explosively. I try to avoid that, of course, because I have been told I sound aggressive even when I don’t feel aggressive, if I’m feeling anxious. Imagine what it’s like when I’m actually upset :/ Without mood stabilizers I have no control whatsoever if I’m scared, anxious, or angry. 

If I realize I’m in the middle of this, or someone tells me I’m there/getting there, it physically hurts when I stop to try and breathe, to control it, and once I nearly passed out. I shake all over trying to mindfully control my mood swings when I’m in the middle of them. After an intense anger or sadness swing, or an extended cycle of wild swings, I’m guaranteed to have a headache afterwards. It can wipe me out for days. 

I also tend to ruminate- this is also called grandiosity, a fancy term for “blowing things out of proportion.” For example, I will take a problem like my daughter needing new shoes but not quite having enough money for it, try to solve that problem immediately (because anxiety tells me I have to) and end up at “I’m a terrible mother who can’t provide anything at all, and don’t deserve to live” instead of “It’s ok, I’ll just have to save and wait.” Hard to stop that train once it’s started.

I could go on and on, but the important thing for you is this- keep your routine, keep your regimen of medications, ask questions, go to therapy. And find a support system, that is so important. And if you learn something about yourself, share it with your loved ones; ask them about what they notice, too, because I was only diagnosed after someone told me it’s not typical to cycle through emotions that quickly on a regular basis, and it’s not typical to feel emotions physically, all the time, sometimes multiple at once, regardless of what they are. That made me ask questions, and after an episode of depression lasting more than a month that I had to file short term disability and accommodation for, the diagnosis made sense of it all. 

I hope you find something helpful in this- and I hope you feel well and healthy and like you’re healing, soon."

I also went through 6 weeks of intensive outpatient therapy- group therapy 3 days a week, and individual therapy 2 days, to get a handle on myself after I spent a weekend inpatient with suicidal ideation/intent/fully devised plan.

While the medications I’m taking are amazing and I feel so, so healthy, I’m telling you I wouldn’t be in the same place without that therapy. 

The medications help stabilize your brain chemicals. The therapy teaches your brain how to use those chemicals to build positive habits and pathways. 

Therapy has literally saved my life, and there are people around me who see me and say “Emily, you look so much better- I’m so happy for you!” They can all see the difference.

It’s expensive, and not easy to manage the schedule sometimes, but I promise it’s worth it! 

Remember to drink water; we all love you ❤️"
breakingmom,f5vkz1l,t3_dpd70p,1572491923.0,"So.... I was the person on the other side of the issue. I hope my take on this will help you.

My partner and I were having a very, very rough time (both going through unemployment, I was homeless, daughter had been sexually abused at daycare, family issues including physical abuse, just a very traumatic time), and he said he needed a break (It was all just too much). 

Now, I’m diagnosed bipolar, and I was waiting for insurance to kick in for mental health issues during all of this, and was off my medications because I couldn’t afford to fill them. 

I freaked out, and I became suicidal. I had dreams about where I’d do it, and eventually, when my daughter went to her father’s for the summer, I decided I wanted to end it all, for many reasons.

My partner figured it out, after some texts where I basically asked him not to leave to give me hope for the future (which I know now as hella manipulative and was NOT ok), and he called the crisis line and gave them my location. I was angry at first, but because I needed help, I went with them willingly- if they were determined to take me, even without my consent with a court order, it would end up with an even worse legal situation with my kid/custody later.

I ended up on a course of treatment that has given me the most healthy and stable outlook I’ve had since childhood. Dare I say it, I feel human, normal.

My partner saved my life by calling the crisis line that day. Regardless of the fact that we later mended fences, and are happier now than we ever were before, he saved my life, and my daughter still has her mom. Even if he hadn’t called me up later so we could heal and be together again, I would still, to this day, say that he saved my life, and be grateful to him.

I didn’t know then that he would call back, that he would ever think to want me again as much as I wanted him. And not everyone gets a happy ending like that. Sounds like that is pretty unlikely for you and your husband, which is sad but if it’s what you need to be safe/healthy, do it! 

Long story short, you can leave, and you can do all you can to help him, but his life is his choice. If you send him help, and he denies it, that’s on him. But you’ve done all you can. Give the rest to God.

I’m so sorry you’re in this. You’ll be in my thoughts."
bipolar,f5vjg7k,t3_dp9s54,1572490828.0,"I asked for 3 different opinions because I did research and found the issues between bipolar and BPD. 

The last opinion I got was from the psychiatrist when I went inpatient this past June (life situations got the better of me while I was waiting for health insurance to cover mental healthcare). 

She sat down with me and really walked through the symptoms of each- when she really got me on her page of a correct bipolar diagnosis is when she  very accurately described symptoms of mania that I have which I had never attributed to mania before. When she said that and I paused, she looked at me and smiled and said “a person with BPD wouldn’t have any idea what I just said- don’t worry. You’re going to be ok, and we are going to get this treated so you hopefully never have to come back inpatient, because you’ll be on the correct treatment plan.” 

She was so kind to me, and listened to all my questions, and I am healthier now than I have been- ever in my life. I don’t recall a time I was as stable, even as a child. 

Look, of the meds you’re on help you, and they’re meds for bipolar, if the boot fits wear it. If meds used to treat BPD help you, wear those boots. It’s all about being healthy- and finding the providers who will care more about how to get you healthy than your label. 

Good luck, brave soul. You can do this!"
bipolar,f5vi7po,t1_f5v7774,1572489940.0,"I totally agree with the once or twice rule! 

I married a man who was 21 years older than me. I was 19 when we got married, and *that* honestly was probably too young- we did end up divorcing after we had our daughter. But the marriage was unhealthy because 1- I didn’t know I was bipolar and was untreated, and 2- he was an alcoholic, and drank more than he earned. So it was probably doomed to start. 

Important point there- I didn’t know I was bipolar, and he refused to get treatment for alcoholism. You already know your health issues, and are vigilant about taking care of them- as long as he is the same for himself, as well as supporting you, and vice-versa, there’s no reason you can’t be happy.

And I *hope* I’m in a place to nab a 22 year old when I’m pushing 40, you go lady!"
breakingmom,f5vaabs,t3_dpehgw,1572485891.0,"Thank you for doing this for your family. Seriously. 

When I lost my job after my daughter was sexually abused at her daycare, my prayer group brought me meals, and it was such a blessing. It was one less thing I had to do. They even gave me paper plates (nice ones), disposable cups, and cutlery so I wouldn’t have to do dishes. 

My pastor’s wife gave a pasta casserole with one of those Dole salad kits, another family did taco fixings and tortillas with corn and black beans, another lady sent us a breakfast casserole with fruit and milk and orange juice, one family did some roasted chicken breasts and veggies. All things that could keep for a while, and that you can warm up individually. No oven needed!

breakingmom,f5v63oh,t3_dpfjta,1572484220.0,"Speaking as a person with anger issues, PTSD, and bipolar mood disorder... even if he has PTSD, that is no excuse for him to be abusive.

He doesn’t have to hit you for it to be abuse. He’s manipulating, he’s isolating you, he’s breaking things and throwing things... this is abuse. I know because I’ve been on both sides (giving during untreated manic episodes, and receiving from an alcoholic ex-husband). It’s taken me a lot of trial and error to did the right prescriptions, therapy, and a divorce to get out of those habits for good. It’s been 5 years since divorce, and 2 years since bipolar diagnosis to become a healthy, thriving individual. 

At the very least, you and DH need counseling, and he needs treatment for his mental health issues in order for your living environment to be, well, livable. Maybe if you have safe family, you can take your son and try a separation for a bit, and therapy alongside.

Mostly? Please take care of you. If you can afford it, see a therapist. Please. At the very least, it will be a way for you to get some additional positive skills to help yourself and your son.

We all love you. And you can do it. Whatever IT is, you can do it. ❤️"
bipolar,f5v4ehw,t1_f5ulkuk,1572483495.0,"The name itself can feel like a slap in the face, for sure. And while it’s easier to treat when there’s a name to what isn’t quite “right”, it also can have some disadvantages- socially, emotionally, mentally.

This is one of those chronic health conditions that is an actual medical condition which people use as a label for negative behavior in general. It’s going to be important to remember that just because there’s a name people have a certain perception about, doesn’t mean it’s not worthy of being treated like any other chronic health condition, like type 1 diabetes, or a heart murmur, or acid reflux.

You can live with this- be kind to yourself, and give yourself time to have your thoughts. If you don’t already, see a therapist. It will be helpful, I promise."
bipolar,f5v3ecg,t3_dpe1h1,1572483105.0,"I was shocked- then, devastated. 

I felt broken, less than, and as a religious person, I also felt that I had been abandoned by God to suffer in ways no human being should. I still alternate between acceptance, anger, sadness, fear, and just plain self-pity because who TF would want to live like this? 

And how could I possibly be any kind of parent to my daughter being like this? She deserves better. I was (am) afraid that I would make her all messed up, and not be who I should be for her.

I also became very angry at my family- my birth parents and my adoptive parents, both, for not doing the things they could have done, and get me the help I asked for that could have taught me how to manage this later in life THEN,  as a teenager, as opposed to now, when it’s harder to treat yourself while balancing full time job, and raising a child. Can’t change the past, though 🙁

I’m about 2 years into dealing with this, and I’m getting a handle on it, and learning to take better care of myself. But it’s totally normal to have all kinds of feelings- you might feel none of these, or some, or all- and at different times, or all at once. That’s the twisted glory of bipolar.

But the most important thing is that you’re not alone- you’re getting treatment, you’re loved, and we are here for the hard days ❤️"

And don’t stop there- I’d not just report that unprofessional conduct, I’d also consult an employment attorney just to have your things in order. Don’t let them jerk you around. If you get another treatment like this, have your employment attorney give them a call. Protect yourself. 

And lady.... start putting your resume out there.... just in case. This employer has already proven to suck, have a back up plan.

These two “friends” of yours are clearly not acquainted with the real world of being responsible adults, or what it takes to be a successful, stable parent. 

I cut out my mother. My mother lived with us while I was pregnant. I warned her she was not to use weed or any other controlled substance in my house. Caught her smoking weed in the basement once- told her never to do it again. She did it again. So I kicked her fucking ass to the curb. NOTHING was going to come between me and my baby, least of all my mother’s stupid fucking habits.

breakingmom,f4fgblv,t3_dkerjk,1571570008.0,"My ex-husband would pull this kind of BS with our 1 year old (alcohol, not a smoker).  His habits and gaslighting when he refused to accept his behavior was irresponsible and flipping it around on me while I was struggling with stress/PPD trying to hold things together where he was failing to help us led to my being inpatient, suicidal after being at the grocery store wondering if I should drink bleach to get out.

Notice the EX part. The nurses in the hospital and my providers urged me to divorce him for the sake of my mental health, and more importantly, my daughter’s physical safety-so I kicked him out when she was just a bit older than 2. She’s now 6, and we are having a bad year due to her being sexually abused/job loss/homelessness, but with therapy and friends, she’s actually doing really well- and her dad isn’t one of our problems.

A mama’s most sacred duty is to protect their children. From ANYONE or ANYTHING within her power. Do you, but things need to be seriously looked at here. :/ 

Also, if you’re pregnant, he has no business using those substances around you. I’m sure you’re aware of HIPAA/mandatory reporter issues in the healthcare industry; a judgmental provider finds any levels of that weed in your system, bad things can happen. Period. 

He needs to get his fucking shit together. Time for a zero tolerance/scorched earth policy, he’s dropping the ball HARD.

We tried to figure out what was causing it, and a month later her attacker was caught in the act by his mom (he was 14, and homeschooled by Christian parents who went to the same church as my bf’s aunt and uncle). 

While it is clear your son doesn’t have this issue (thank the Lord!), he clearly has some kind of imbalance. This is not “normal” behavior. This is something that needs a pediatric psychiatrist. 

If you can get him into BHIS (Behavioral health Intervention Services), get the correct diagnosis, and the correct medications, this can improve. I’m Bipolar 2, and these processes, including inpatient, and outpatient therapies, have done wonders, and I’ve seen them do wonders in kids in my extended family.

Once for the “reprocessing” phase, and the second for the aftermath, because EMDR can be a destabilizing process for anyone. It can be worse for people with BPMD, so we are being pretty careful with that. 

However, it is very effective for making progress, especially in those whose mental health issues are resultant of/exacerbated by trauma. 

It’s doing good things for me, but I also did Intensive Outpatient Therapy, and have been very engaged in doing self-work and self care. Gotta do the whole package.

bipolar,ewmk1lw,t3_coznzw,1565553532.0,"Psychiatrist. PCPs just don’t have the experience to properly diagnose mental health concerns. 

Now how to find one, I would find the hospitals nearest you, and see if they have floors specifically for mental health. Those floors can range from Inpatient residency, to outpatient options, intensive, or routine. You don’t have to be a resident to get good care from a psychiatrist. The hospitals that have inpatient floors are usually the ones with the best providers who really know their field. 

You can also see if the hospitals near you have extensive substance abuse programs. The unfortunate truth is that those with mental health concerns are often lumped in with substance abuse patients, so if there are programs for that at the hospital, they generally also have the means to have outpatient/routine psychiatry care. 

They will usually give you a questionnaire or two for you to fill out, so they can see your symptoms and take assessment of your behaviors/thoughts. It is extremely important that you fill them out completely and honestly. That is how they will help you frame your diagnosis. At first it might take a while. These issues are complex, like unraveling three colors of knitted yarn, trying to separate them into their respective skiens. But you can get the right diagnosis- and it’s ok to question it and get second, or third opinions. You are the best advocate for your own care. When you call to make the appointment, just say you’ve not been feeling right, and describe your symptoms. That’s all you have to say. 

It’s scary to take the leap to put a name to how you’re suffering. It’s been two years since my diagnosis, and I’m still having a hard time coming to grips with my bipolar 2 diagnosis. I’ve gotten diagnosis opinions from the 4 providers I’ve seen, just to be sure I had the correct diagnosis.
