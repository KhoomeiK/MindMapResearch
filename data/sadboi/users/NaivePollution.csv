Then I have like ""hot keys"" on my home screen. It's basically toggle buttons so I don't have to search the function in my phone.

For example I have a ""Bluetooth ON"" toggle. It's a Routine that says 

""When widget is pressed, turn on Bluetooth""

&#x200B;

It's a bit useless since I can turn that on and off from the notification panel but I'm a bit lazy sometimes and I just feel like pressing the widget right on my home screen.

I think Routines are for things that repeat themselves every certain amount of time or that I triggered by a location whereas quick commands can be started anytime but you want to save the extra clicks.

For example I wanted to create a Quick command/Routine called ""Working"" 

I want it to :

1. set a timer for 25mn (Pomodoro)
2. launch Digital Wellbeing > Focus (it greys out all apps except the ones in the exception list)
3. play my favourite playlist for working
4. decline calls and send a text back explaining I will call later

The timer works but then it struggles to launch Wellbeing and it won't turn on Focus anyways.

&#x200B;

If you want to think of a good routine, try to think of things you do with your phone that takes many steps. For example, let's say everytime you have a meeting, you turn on Do Not Disturb, then start Samsung Notes then New Voice Recording, then you split your screen with your emails or with PowerPoint.

Well all these steps can be combined into 1 with a Quick Command. Since it's not something that happens every day at the exact same time it's best not to use a Routine for that.

But you could use a Routine for, let's say everytime you plug in your headphones between 10am and 11am, play your favorite playlist and start Samsung Health, turn on GPS and send a text message to your best friend saying : ""hey I'm going to run, wanna join?"""

loseit,fo37abf,t3_fkofkb,1587481874.0,"Since March I have implemented changes in my life: exercising and eating better (and less). 
A month later: no results at all.
It's driving me crazy.

Here's what I do : 

Exercice:

2h of cardio (low intensity cardio and medium intensity) daily. Sometimes when I feel like it: a medium intensity 45 mn pilates video with focus on the lower body

Food: 

No breakfast (I wake up late and I don't feel very hungry in the morning). I usually drink a big mug of unsweetened green tea (I never add sweeteners to my tea).

At lunch I eat vegetables (spinach /zucchini/lead/broccoli/artichoke) with a bit of olive oil, lemon juice and salt. And I eat white fish (microwaved) with a bit of olive oil and lemon juice. Sometimes I have desert: a natural yogurt with some frozen berries (raspberries/blueberries etc. It's a mix bag). No sweeteners at all.
And unsweetened tea.
I don't feel hungry at all!

During the day if I start feeling hungry or bored I grab another natural yogurt and an apple. Or maybe a small handful of almonds.
Unsweetened tea.
I also drink water. And I may chew sugar free gum if I'm really bored.

Dinner
Same as lunch but different vegetables, different fish or maybe 2 eggs instead of fish. Frozen fruit for dessert (berries or watermelon balls). I'm buying everything frozen lately to avoid touching fruits and vegetables at the shop. Maybe another yogurt. Sometimes I can grab a small piece of cheese like goat cheese because I like that. No bread.
Actually, aside from the carbs contained in the vegetables and fruits I don't eat carbs and I like it that way.

I want to mention again that I don't feel as if I was starving myself and I don't feel hungry at all. Occasionally I may feel a bit hungry if I delay lunch or dinner but otherwise I'm fine.

And I added the 2h daily cardio + cleaning my apartment almost every day.

And still I'm not losing weight. Nothing, Nada, Nichts! I don't have a scale so I can't know what my exact weight is currently but I measure my waist and hips every day and nothing moves! Jeans fit the same!
I see no changes in my face.
Nothing is happening and it's extremely frustrating.
I'm not allowed to go out often but whenever I can I walk daily.

I'm taking plant based diuretics to see if it's water weight but my legs and ankles aren't any thinner.

I'm a female and I'm 5'3 around 145 pounds.

I don't know what to do. Even if I wasn't doing things perfectly, gosh I should at least shed some pounds. But looks like my body won't even get rid of 1 pound in 1 month!

Should I cut off the cheese? The fruits? The olive oil? The yogurts? What is there left to do?

(I'm not a fan of strength training and the pilates video is enough)."
Anxiety,fj6sfjq,t3_fbq6n2,1583079163.0,"I've been feeling the same as well. Declining lots of invitation. Problem is that after 2 or 3 declines people stop asking and you end up more alone.
I would suggest to force yourself and set a timer like (I will see that person for 1h only and pretend I'm seeing someone else at 5pm for example).

Otherwise I've developed OCD with cleaning as a (bad) way to cope with anxiety and depression. I clean my house all the time. I also declutter a lot because now I'm into minimalism (as opposed to the mess and chaos in my mind). I need counters, desks and tables to be empty, empty sofa, I removed the shelves and anything visible. My house looks like a minimalist IKEA catalogue photo but at least I feel at peace in it. The downside of it is that I can't stay a weekend without cleaning everything. Everything. It's spot clean!
It prevents me from doing interesting stuff instead or just relax but it takes the stress away and keeps me busy doing something ""useful"" with quick rewards (good looking house).

If your house is full of stuff I suggest you declutter. Even if that means getting rid of some pans and pots. If you live alone, one or two is enough. Plus it means less dish washing.
Worst case scenario you will trash something useful and regret it but nothing that can't be bought again. And if it was a rare item, if you ditched it before it somehow means it was clutter and you're just being nostalgic."

Hello,

Is it the fat or the lack of cardio?

It's so uncomfortable to arrive sweating in front of people. It's like I have to take a 15 minute advance in order to walk slowly and thus not sweat."

I think I also have the fear of missing out. Whenever I see something online that I like, I ""need"" to buy it urgently because I'm afraid it becomes sold out and miss out an opportunity of looking good. The irony of it is that I'm not comfortable with my body any more so I don't wear anything I like for fear of being disappointed about my image. If I buy a dress I like, I'm afraid of putting it on and realise the dress doesn't look as nice now that I'm actually wearing it. Keeping the clothes on the hanger kind of keeps the hope alive that someday I will make the most of the dress (or any clothes).

You are totally right about slipping into bad habits whenever my space isn't tidy! Turns out my bulimia binges are the worst whenever my apartment is messy. I think it even triggers them. 

But I'm also very bad at keeping routines. Everything is clean by Sunday evening and on Monday I can already see the mess slowly creeping in.
