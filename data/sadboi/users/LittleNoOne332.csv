ptsd,f4ynxv9,t3_dm80ip,1571880965.0,"Yes!

Especially swear words. It doesn't even have to be in an angry tone. Hearing them is the same to me as being yelled at aggressively. Not sure why but glad I'm not alone."
birthcontrol,f3zc138,t1_f3ykbmz,1571266098.0,"I found it great. Cramping the first couple days was brutal, not going to lie. No periods after that. I would get some headaches and slight cramping each month around the time I would have had my periods. Nothing I couldn't deal with though. Unfortunately had it removed recently. 

My SO claimed it constantly pricked him despite two of my docs saying the string was perfectly fine. TBH he was probably just being a wimp."
birthcontrol,f3whfhl,t3_diiq3c,1571202635.0,"Same happened to me. Got it put in the month of October a few years ago. Great for a few weeks then constant HEAVY bleeding when normally I have super light periods. 

It would occasionally stop for a day then start up again. After 4 months I couldn't take it anymore and my doctor switched me to Mirena (stopped my periods completely). 
Everyone responds different so maybe ask your doctor if it's normal and what's considered too long. 
Hope you feel better soon!"
ptsd,f266x1q,t3_dc1r8s,1569995993.0,You are not the only one! I thought it was just me. It's scary for me to think he is ACTUALLY the president and I'm not in a dream.

ptsd,esshp41,t3_c92mmx,1562252016.0,I completely relate with you on this. It can be difficult to explain that even though they aren't yelling at me the yelling one is enough to be scary.
pics,erf587r,t1_ereu0e9,1560800299.0,I got it when I was 16 (crazy but true). So painful and uncomfortable. Three more times between then and turning 25. Ask your doctor again about the shingles vaccine. I was recently told there is one (completely blanked on the name) and with a doctor's recommendation you can get it younger if you've had shingles.
ptsd,epmeqij,t3_bv5er3,1559312173.0,"I wish I knew! 
Didn't know other people had this too. I try to avoid crowds (hard in a big family) so I tend to smile as an answer. I get so panicky but try to be calm on the outside. People usually make an excuse to leave after about 2 of my smile responses."
ptsd,eojjf7j,t3_bs36io,1558638687.0,"I can totally relate. It really messes with me as I am married and have kids. I only finally opened up about it to my husband and am trying to work on it in therapy. To be honest though it's hard to imagine being ""normal"" about sex.
Hope things get easier for you. Just remember it's not bad to feel this way ❤️"
