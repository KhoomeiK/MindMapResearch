SkincareAddiction,fnboowt,t1_fnbmtua,1586819338.0,"I apply AHA directly after cleansing, sometimes when my face is a tiny bit damp. 

I also use stratias liquid gold, first aid beauty ultra repair cream mixed with a couple of drops of biossance squalane."
SkincareAddiction,fnbhypm,t3_g0bl2w,1586815850.0,"Hi guys. Wondering how to layer AHA and Azelaic acid. I have used both the stratia AHA and TO Azelaic acid for over 6 months.

I have also used Cosrx black head power liquid for a couple of years

I would like to layer the AHA and Azelaic acid at night time daily and use the BHA during the day twice a week. How should I layer the night time products? 

Thank you!"

curlyhair,fnbhfpu,t1_fn9d0f0,1586815591.0,Thank you! Will try this and will also will try mousse
curlyhair,fnbh10y,t1_fnaks2p,1586815388.0,"Thank you! I been doing just conditioner, no gel or mousse and the gel was totally what made my hair not dry. Might look for a mousse since I have thin hair"
curlyhair,fn47vqo,t1_fmzorim,1586635854.0,Same thing happened to me! It‚Äôs my first time trying to use gel and I used the LA products one. It seems like I could get lost of the crunch out of my hair on top but the ends are stiff and I‚Äôm not sure how to take it off. I have thinner wavy hair
curlyhair,fn47n7g,t3_fxs402,1586635716.0,"Tried curly hair method yesterday and my hair is pretty curly now although I have been more of a wavy girl. 

Two things: my hair took forever to dry! Which is unusual for me. I did a reset wash, conditioned with tresemme and added LA gel. I scrunched out my hair with a t shirt so it‚Äôs possible that I didn‚Äôt scrunch out enough...? 


Also it‚Äôs been impossible for me to scrunch out the crunch, is this indicative of too much gel? 


Thank you ü•∞"

SkincareAddiction,eu287si,t3_ce7t9r,1563384446.0,"Hi! 

It‚Äôs been 2 weeks of me trying out timeless Squalane on half my face and the biossance Squalane on my other half

The timeless side has a bunch of tiny little break outs on my cheek area - typical of the way I break out. They are all under the skin, flesh colored bumps. No white heads or black heads. The other side is pretty clear. Nothing unusual 

Is 2 weeks enough to conclude that timeless Squalane is not for me? ‚ò∫Ô∏è thank you."

But for the last couple of i don‚Äôt know, days? Weeks? It‚Äôs been getting darker - so that it shows through my make up. My subconscious kept repeating something like doesn‚Äôt product start to move towards your eyes as you sleep? But I wouldn‚Äôt remember if I had made it up."
