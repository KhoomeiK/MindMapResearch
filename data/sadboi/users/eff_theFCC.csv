selfharm,fqumgcq,t3_gky7e5,1589661251.0,Mega yikes. The only place that I don’t chicken out of hurting is my left arm and I’m so grateful for that because it limits my ability to self harm. For him to say that is disgusting. School counselors honestly aren’t SHIT. I’ve never gotten good help from them.
selfharm,fqoxiby,t3_gjsh6v,1589527902.0,YEAH you will!!! You got this.

AskRedditAfterDark,fqijony,t1_fqhcw58,1589396900.0,"Judging by the fact that my first partner came out to me by saying she had a crush on me a little while after we started, I’m going to go ahead and assume pretty common lmao"
sex,fqgq5di,t3_giqq76,1589353514.0,Dude this is consensual and pleasurable for you as well as him. As long as you’re both having fun it’s fine. If you want to have a lot of sex then have a lot of sex. I’m not seeing any issues here. If you didn’t feel comfortable with it it’d be another thing but it sounds like you were just enjoying yourselves until your friends got in your head.
sex,fqgpyiw,t3_giiguw,1589353346.0,“I hope I feel something this time” “ow” “fuck I’m not contributing enough” “ow” “should I tell him he’s got the completely wrong spot” “fuck I should do something more for him”
abuse,fqgf71z,t1_fqgbjm8,1589344722.0,"That’s a valid fear but I think it’s worth it to ask yourself if you should let that possibility stop you from seeking help. Maybe your home environment won’t change, but maybe it will! It sucks when the people responsible for helping you don’t believe you and it can feel frustrating or embarrassing, but that’s not always what happens. If you talk to someone, they could help stop it. And either way, I promise there’s so many therapists out there who will believe you and can help you feel better internally even if your options become limited externally. Regardless of what happens legally, you deserve to have your truth heard and to get help from a therapist who can support you. A therapist has no reason not to believe you from the beginning. I wish you luck whatever you decide and I hope you can recover from what’s happened to you and you don’t have to go through any of it again."
selfharm,fqgehso,t3_gim517,1589344219.0,"I’m really proud of you! Staying clean is tough and it sounds like you’re really dedicated to recovery. That’s admirable. As for the other stuff, it’s tough to deal with the wanting support from friends vs feeling guilty about possibly hurting them, and honestly I haven’t figured it out. But a good step could be texting (for me THATS easier to not chicken out than irl) to ask your one friend if you can talk to him about some mental health struggles you’re having. Make it clear you don’t expect him to do anything much (like being responsible for fixing it or stuff like that)—not only does that make it easier for him, it’ll probably make you feel less guilty if that’s something you struggle with. If he says he is, let him know that you struggle with self harm but you’ve been clean for about a year. You don’t have to give any details that you don’t want to. Then you can let him know that you almost relapsed the other day and ask for anything you need (does the way that you two argue trigger urges? Do you want reassurance that just because you fight doesn’t mean xyz? Do you just want to get it off your chest and be able to talk about it?) You can tell him the reason if he wants to know/you want to tell him(but you don’t have to) while making it clear that he’s never at fault for your coping mechanisms and you don’t blame him (unless you do, in which case maybe try talking that out in a civil way, and even though it’s hard try to remember that ultimately taking responsibility is really important for recovery). You can do it!!! But you also don’t have to. It sounds like you want to get it off your chest though, and you feel safe that it won’t negatively impact your relationship. Whatever you do I wish you luck and I hope you know we’re all super happy for you that you’re able to stay clean!! And if you slip up that’ll be okay too and it won’t make you worth any less. Set backs happen. Wishing you the best!!"
AskRedditAfterDark,fqgd0ra,t1_fqfxugx,1589343195.0,Yeah I wonder if it could also have something to do with the endorphin rush from exercise?
AskRedditAfterDark,fqgcxq5,t1_fqfjx0b,1589343138.0,I practice karate and sparring honestly makes me so goddamn horny. The exhilaration from a high activity level and just the concept of fighting paired with the physical intimacy and power struggle definitely gets me in the mood for a slightly different physical activity afterwards.
AskRedditAfterDark,fqgclit,t3_giha2l,1589342910.0,I am constantly horny but in all seriousness I think it depends. During the workout I get pretty focused and don’t think about too much else besides what I’m doing. But afterwards? With those endorphins and the pride in myself for taking the time to get fit and take care of myself? And with the knowledge that my fwb thinks I look even hotter when I’m sweaty and kinda a mess?? Yeah I tend to get horny unless I’m really tired or hungry.
AmItheAsshole,fqgc496,t3_gig1ij,1589342593.0,Uhhhh NTA at all??? That’s a really strange thing to get so upset about. It’s a pet name. You weren’t telling your sister to eat peanuts herself and you weren’t eating them in front of her (although personally I’d be fine with someone eating something I can’t in front of me over video chat). I don’t see what the problem is.

abuse,fqgau7q,t3_gin11l,1589341762.0,"You’re NOT overreacting I promise. If it’s at all possible, let a therapist, teacher, any non-family adult that you trust know what’s going on. None of that is okay."
mentalillness,fqgajsg,t3_giilbe,1589341574.0,Awesome!
therapy,fq5cpfg,t3_ggx2my,1589100376.0,"If you’re looking for a diagnosis, a therapist can’t give that to you. However, they might recommend you to a psychologist/psychiatrist who can. Psychologists, from what I know, can diagnose but not medicate. Only psychiatrists can medicate you (out of the three). If you’re looking to work through your trauma, mental state, and coping mechanisms, then seeing a therapist is a great place to start. For me it’s really helpful, and they’ll let you know if they think you need to move up the ladder."
selfharm,fpr1qbj,t3_geulkb,1588839299.0,"Your doctor will know your situation better than any of us, but from what I know antidepressants take at least 3 weeks to work, and can take up to 8, so if you can it might be worth it to keep going and see if it helps. Definitely let whoever it is that’s responsible for monitoring you and your meds know about your concerns though!"
selfharm,fpr1229,t3_genpb8,1588838637.0,Helpful on couches—good for naps and friends’ naps!! Those decorative things better stay away from my bed though.
selfharm,fpr0u6k,t3_gexdot,1588838423.0,"Meaningless music, watching the news/random YouTube videos, dming group chats/friends, really anything that makes me take in words that aren’t about SH or that make me give out words that aren’t about SH. Also exercise (in a group the instructor talks which helps, also my body is physically occupied so I don’t have access to hurting myself)—martial arts been really good for me."
selfharm,fpqvt06,t3_gevv96,1588833732.0,"I try to talk to my friends through social media. Group chats get chaotic and it completely distracts me from wanting to self harm once a conversation gets going. That being said, if the interaction ends on a negative note or my attempts to start a conversation get ignored, it can sometimes make it worse."
TalkTherapy,fpqeaj7,t3_geyfgr,1588820855.0,"There’s nothing wrong with going weekly! Recovery isn’t linear and sometimes we need extra support. It doesn’t mean you’re losing it. In fact, you committing to therapy and going in every week shows that you’re putting in the work to help yourself and you’ll be better off for it. It sucks to feel like you’re losing progress or getting worse, but it sounds like you’ve made it pretty far and I’m sure you’ll be able to get through this. Things happen, and it’s okay to not be doing okay, and it’s especially understandable now when there’s so much chaos and confusion. Your therapist just wants whats best for you!"
TalkTherapy,fpqdq1l,t1_fpq9k9f,1588820501.0,Thank you! I’ll talk to her about how I feel like I’m holding back next session.
