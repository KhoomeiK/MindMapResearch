relationship_advice,fep5uo2,t1_fep5l9m,1579312803.0,oh that’s okay! Thank you for the advice. I guess I was hoping there was some quick fix and I could click my fingers and it would be all better. I think you confirmed what I knew (but didn’t really want to acknowledge) that there’s only one way to do it and it’s working hard on yourself.
relationship_advice,fep4wl9,t1_fep3emo,1579312200.0,"to be fair to myself, I don’t think I treat him in a way that’s unfair. I give my all to people when I like them and I really do like him. If I feel a certain way, I usually talk to him about it and we sort it out, and vice versa, so he’s not in the dark about things. At the end of the day, I’d never treat him badly. I’m the sort of person that can’t kill flies, let alone hurt someone I deeply cherish and love. I’m mainly asking for help on how I can believe that he feels the same way and dispel the negative thoughts when I know that rationally they’re untrue. 

I’m not sure how to open my mind though- that’s kind of what I’m asking in the post. 

Thank you for taking the time to write a response :)"

You’re right though. I do look for clues - but I’m able to commit and apart from this, my recovery is going really well. 9 months clean from self harm and taking my medication as i should hahah. 
Thanks for the response, I wish I could just calm down and stop overthinking it. I’m not sure how though, honestly."
CPTSD,fdpvwim,t1_fdov0ip,1578642685.0,"hi, I’m 18. My medication works well if i take it when I’m supposed to but i forget to take it a lot. I phrased the post a bit weirdly because I’m terrible at proofreading but what I meant was I started medication when I was 15, where they built me up to a very high dosage for my weight and age group. I’m on a different medication to the one they gave me then, because it didn’t work that well except for numbing every emotion i had and causing me to dissociate. 

The medication I’m on now is also a high dosage but works much better when i remember to take it. 

I’m in therapy and my living situation is complicated, but basically I bounce between my parents houses. I went to a boarding school so that was also in the mix, but i’ve left school now. 

Thank you very much for your supportive words. It’s a relief feeling like there’s people rooting for you."

CPTSD,f23f24f,t3_dbki23,1569921079.0,"my mum once called me the glue of the family to my therapist, which cued a discussion on “why are you relying on your 14 year old daughter to keep the family together??”

I’m the middle child. I would always be the one to resolve conflict or de-escalate a situation.
I’d also head family meetings where we discussed what the issue was. Keeping a family of 5 in check during one of those, while everyone is mad at each-other and there’s a high chance you’ll be blamed if a fight breaks out is incredibly stressful. If my dad started getting violent then I would blame myself and beat myself up over it for ages- bc i was meant to be the one to prevent that. 

Now I’m quite an angry and emotional person because while growing up i never fully learnt how to deal w my own emotions beyond completely hiding them away."

dating_advice,f0rr9ll,t3_d6alsm,1568891021.0,"okay as a bona fide female maybe i can help here a bit. 
Things that are super attractive are nice smelling colognes (not overpowering though), good hair, clean face (seriously, wash your face) generally good hygiene and looking after yourself. The gym doesn’t hurt either. I find beards hot but not everyone does so that’s up to you! 
What isn’t attractive: football shirts. Please don’t wear football shirts it seems super low effort.  Bad breath or overpowering smells (any smell, even cologne or deodorant) also aren’t very pleasant. Greasy hair or long hair that isn’t a style choice.
