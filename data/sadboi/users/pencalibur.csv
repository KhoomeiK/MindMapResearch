Not exact, but a very versatile dress! And pretty simple too for knits!"
Anxiety,fpu3xe5,t3_gf7ars,1588904130.0,"Yeah. I was a depressed kid who didn't eat and now my appetite has been super unstable pretty much my whole life. However I will admit that smoking pot has really helped with that. I smoke because I like it but when I don't I notice that I don't really eat at all. For like days. I'm pretty sure it's the only thing that actually gets me hungry!

Maybe not the right answer, but an honest one! It sucks. My significant other says I should force myself to eat but if I'm not hungry the thought of food going down my throat makes me want to gag! I start meals headstrong and lose all steam halfway through all the time too"

I haven't gotten married but I used to think a lot when I was young about how to pick either my step dad or my bio dad to walk me down the isle someday.

And sometimes I slip up, but I always apologize for overreaction and explain that I was frustrated and should have handled it better. I have a ways to go but I want to accountability for my actions so they know they are wonderful little humans who mean the world to me no matter what.

Just admitting that you have work to do makes you a better role model than many of the people in my life so good for you. Keep powering through, and remember that you are a human too who makes mistakes ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Anxiety,fjxz599,t3_ffb16t,1583686616.0,"I feel you. All I want to do is sleep and give in to the constant, crushing desire to lay in bed and do nothing but feel overwhelmed. But I have two kids, a job, college, and all sorts of other fun responsibilities getting in my way. It drives me nuts but sometimes I think its better to be busy and feel crazy than to let myself get consumed by my issues. Mixed bag for sure!"

Anxiety,fdpd471,t1_fdo33x3,1578625599.0,You beat me to it. As did many others. But that's what I call it too. I just feel emotionally and physically exhausted after rough days
raisedbynarcissists,fbwbdpk,t3_eeoon4,1577145484.0,"So I recently had a rather dramatic argument with my n/grandmother (who me and my family live with for the sake of me going to college) and all of a sudden my n/mom (who I don't talk to often) 's boyfriend (who I've met once) is texting me, so I call her and I'm quite upset to be honest and this woman started to laugh and say that it was okay if I wanted to take it out on her. I was already more mad than I have honestly ever been in my life, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Her LAUGHING at my distress before minimalizing it, as if she even has any right to be involved in the conversation to begin with.

It is sick. I don't talk to my mom much, she has lived in another state for years. And sometimes I wonder if things were warped in my young mind but that moment was a big reinforcer to me. If she can laugh at me in one of the worst moments in my life, I can't have imagined being as miserable as I was as a child.

I never want to do that to my kids. Never never."

Anxiety,f9nkd8t,t3_e5zco5,1575486032.0,"Yes. I loathe it. Even talking to people I've known for a long time.

For any non-personal call, I take notes the whole time on anything I think to so I can negate my fear of misremembering info, and I make kind of a ""script"" of what I'm going to say when they answer. It helps me a lot to kind of go in with a plan.

I hate making calls but it's a necessary evil! I cant control my fear too much but it helps to go into any calal feeling more ""prepared"""
weed,f8sgbyi,t3_e1x1v6,1574779982.0,"Yeah I smoke several times daily. Makes me a more pleasant, less anxious, and less short tempered person ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

It looked great after I got all the egg out though!"
Anxiety,f7hbaju,t3_dw917l,1573736977.0,"Yeah, although I think that when I was a kid I was too depressed to be anxious. I know my anxious tendencies have always been there, but it didn't start to really impact me until a few years ago when I stopped being depressed. Just swapped out mental illnesses!

Sometimes I still have depressed days. And I'm so shut out from all of my feelings that I'm not even anxious anymore. And I think that's how it must have been for years in my youth :/"
Anxiety,f6xxawu,t3_dtl4ij,1573261248.0,"I don't mind vomiting myself (don't love it of course but it's just discomfort) but I can't handle people around me getting sick, or acting like they may get sick. I dont like being around drunk people and theme parks make me nervous. Anyone saying they don't feel well make some anxious. But someone vomiting in my presence, or if I knew they vomited earlier, it sends me I to full panic mode. Idk why, I'm not afraid of getting sick really. I guess just the unpredictable nature? Lack of control? Idk!

It's strange because I woke with people and their body fluids and vomit is the only thing I can't handle. Sure way to get out of a poop cleaning situation is around me is to threaten to feel ill"
Anxiety,f5tc8cj,t3_doz3zc,1572455311.0,"Yes. I very rarely have panic attacks (like 3 times ever) but I have a steady low level of anxiety constantly. Sometimes I get waves of it being more intense, like I have to take a deep breath and remind myself that I can breathe fine even if it feels like an elephant is on my chest. Sometimes for some stupid trigger like being late, sometimes I have no idea why.

Sometimes it feels hard to talk about my anxiety because when I'm talking to someone who does have panic attacks, I feel like I shouldn't complain. But it IS real to me, a physiological response I have no control of. And it sucks ass because it never really stops, unless I'm too depressed to feel anything at all which happens too.

My brain is an asshole."
Anxiety,f4gp8ju,t3_dkf9qw,1571583222.0,"Yes! I am terrified of vomit (not grossed out, actually scared of it. Idk why) and me, my hubby, and two kids all got hit with the stomach virus. I got it first, so I was okay early in and caring for my sick kids for a week and it was horrible. I had what I refer to as an anxiety hangover for ever, from the anxiety while they were sick, and then the anxiety that they weren't really done being sick. My body was shot, I was exhausted and sore from the 100% of the time muscle tightness while I was home. Also terror shits for weeks!

Anxiety is physically exhausting as much as it is mentally, and if I can always anticipate it after a long bout of physical anxiety symptoms. It's rough :/"
Anxiety,f3zbjwz,t3_dirvvk,1571265757.0,"That's why I take notes during literally any phone call, so I can mentally confirm it when I write it down and then I can feel good referring to it later (mostly good lol still a little doubt but I try to ignore it)"

raisedbynarcissists,f3hrmm6,t3_dgxg82,1570927613.0,"Right now I love with my grandmother (who is absolutely a narcissist) and I hate being out of my room. Of course I have 2 kids to take care of so it's not realistic. We have ""our"" common area but I don't like it out there either lol (today my 4 year old was shocked to see me sitting on the couch out there while we waited to leave). My grandmother tried to invite me to spend time in ""her"" living room (she tries to record stuff for me and that TV is the only one with the box) and I absolutely will not. There's a threshold and my anxiety spikes as soon as my feet are over it. I'm a hot mess so I have no words of advice, but you're not alone!"
raisedbynarcissists,f23t6x8,t1_f23sekc,1569936975.0,"I am looking into this, and I have a hopefully non offensive question: I see a lot of mention of God, is it also a good environment if that is not really your path? It really does seem like something I could benefit from, but I don't want to hurt my progress in anything by not quite being on the same page on that front"
raisedbynarcissists,f0q5giz,t3_d63v4w,1568854217.0,"I often feel a lot like I have no family. Did not have a good relationship with my mom when I was a kid, but we are alright now. However she lives in another state and we don't really talk too much. My father dipped out of my life due to him not liking the boy I was dating almost 10 years ago (who I'm still with now, with 2 kids of my own) and that sucks because even though I only saw him once a week, we had a lot of fun. And sometimes I miss him despite the fact that I am so freaking angry at him for abandoning me and refusing to acknowledge my kids. My step dad was a big part of my life but I got essentially double stepped when he remarried and his new wife and kids took over (my family is confusing) ... It hurts a lot. I get reminders of my family interacting with each other without me constantly. HOWEVER, I love my in laws. I feel a level of comfort with them that I have NEVER felt with my own family. I can walk in there and make a cup of coffee and then go smoke with his mom and I never feel weird asking for things or raiding for snacks. I prefer to go there for holidays. I feel like I am part of their family. Being there feels natural and not at all tense or awkward. 

It sucks. It sucks to see people who come from these supportive environments, and to not be able to even fathom it. I have never felt like I have someone to go to. I still feel that way sometimes, because there's things you just don't want to talk to your significant other about, and I wish so much that I had the kind of relationship with my mom where I could text her about my problems. My kids are young but I'm trying so hard to let them know I'm always there for them. It's so important to me that I can be that person for them.

I guess my point is that you're not alone, and you're young and there is still time for you to find your people. I have my man, my two kids, and I recently found a friend who is the perfect mixture of understanding my anxiety but not letting me use it as an excuse and having someone to talk to about all of my inner crazy while knowing she isn't judging me has made a huge difference in the current hot mess of a situation I'm in. My family sucked ass so I had to go and make my own, and the path that I took has lead me to meet some wonderful people who have been there for me in times of need, even when I didn't have anyone else to turn to."
anxietymemes,evnrn2e,t3_ciw6zy,1564630728.0,For me it's more the fact that I analyze all my actions to figure out what ways anxiety is making me a terrible person.
