AskReddit,fqzv621,t3_glsqzp,1589776172.0,"When my tire came off on the highway, I was going about 120km/h, I took a sharp turn to the left, hit the median (which was more like a gully) and rolled 3 and a half times coming to a stop upside down and in on coming traffic. 

I was on my way to move in to my dorm for college and I was following my folks on the highway, my poor father saw the accident in the review mirror. Once the car came to a stop the most surreal feeling came over me, it was like a dream. My boyfriend at the time (who was in the passenger seat) asked me if I was okay, I had to check in with my body as I dissociated, once I was ""back in my body"" I was sore, my head was in agony and my neck hurt but I could move everything with minimal pain. It was at this point that I  could hear my mother screaming my name.... I will never forget that. 

My boyfriend and I undid our seatbelts, we had to crawl into the back seat to ger out. I could see my mom on her knees, and man peering into the back driver side window, asking me if I was hurt .... I was relatively calm at this point, but stuck in the car, and then the guy yells out, ""does anyone have a fire extinguisher?!"" 

""WTF IS MY CAR ON FIRE?? GET ME OUT, GET ME OUT.""  I went from shock to utter fear in a split second, thought we were going to die by fire. A few men managed to pry the door open and we both crawled out, both totally unscathed (minus some bruising and a concussion.)

Parenting,fpl85np,t3_ge09pg,1588708065.0,"My two year old daughter is very similar. She never has a sustained interest in any of her toys, even if I sit and play with her. She throws them when she's lost interest and dumps her toy baskets just to walk away immediately after. 

I worry too, but I'm fairly certain it's age appropriate. When she throws her toys I ask her to ""please pick that up and bring it to me."" I then reiterate that ""when you're done with a toy, bring it to me please."" 

I just keep trying different activities. The other day I took her to a school field to run around and kick a ball. She had zero interest and instead found a patch of dirt/sand and sat and played in that for 20 minutes. I think she just has high sensory needs so I'm making a sand sensory bin for the back patio. I also have a slide into a ball pit as well as a kids trampoline but again she doesnt play with either too often or for too long if she does. It's not physical activity she's after, it's mental stimulation and I haven't quite found the things that keep her occupied for longer than 2 minutes, but it's generally sensory things that keep her attention longest."

Anyway, when we got home and got all of our pictures developed I was so looking forward to showing my folks that I wasnt crazy, until I went through my pictures and discovered that where the cat pictures should of been, were pictures of some random man I had never seen before.

If I can and it's safe to do so, I walk away, regroup, and then come back and talk to my child.

But I can say I definitely feel a difference already, I've kinda swung into a mixed state as my brain detoxes from this shit, so there has been a lot of positive self talk, reaching out to friends and family (all of whom I had to be honest with in regards to how bad my dependency was.) and of course communication with my doctor. I'm hell bent and determined this time round to get off pot. It serves no useful purpose for me and makes my lows lower and highs higher. There may have been a time in my life where it ""treated"" my mental illness but it just spun into an addiction which is not healthy no matter the susbstance. 

I've also been using the app ""I am Sober,"" which I've found to be quite helpful. And I'm reading up on marijuana addiction and addiction in general to better understand it. Helps to sort my thoughts out and understand what's happening in my brain in regards to addiction and detox.

I'm also creating new habits, like going for daily walks, and working out in my basement with simple free weights and resistance bands. I'm essentially looking for a new hobby, or a new healthy habit. If I could put all that time and energy (and money) into pot I can invest it into myself by creating a new life that's not centered around pot. 

I threw out all.of my pot paraphernalia. It doesnt help to have that stuff around and serves no use. 

I've come to the realization that I will always be in recovery. I cant control my use and unfortunately abstaining is my only option. And I'm okay with that. But it took me some time to accept this aa pot has been such a huge part of my life for so long. 

I'm setting goals for myself. I want to return to school and change professions. But I can only pursue that goal once I hit a year pot free. That's the deal I've made with myself. 

I have been reading a lot of material on marijuana dependency and addiction in general which I've found helpful to understand what's happening in my brain and body both during use and once you abstain.

Now, dont get me wrong, I've achieved goals, I have a career, a family., all those things that functioning adults have AND a rip-roaring addiction to pot that has slowly permeated into every aspect of my life. But more on that later.

I tried every drug under the sun in my youth, but nothing held power over me like pot does. Nothing has been as destructive as pot. No, my chances of immediate death upon consumption of pot is slim to none, but death by pot is a slow, agonizing, self destructive death. I am alive, but I am not living. My depression and anxiety are not treated by pot, it lmakes it worse at this point. 

Sure, I've been lucky to chisel out a ""life"" for myself but pot has made it 100% more difficult. My whole adult life has literally been 1 step forward, 3 steps backwards. I am 33, my addiction is starting to catch up to me, I have gone into debt for a fucking plant. I have passed up opportunities, ruined career advancements, compromised relationships and burned bridges all because of fucking pot. 

I'm telling you this because I'm essentially begging you to see the error in your actions and correct it now, while you're a head of the game. There is an underlying cause that is leading you down a path of self medicating. Don't end up like me, don't waste your potential, don't shit on your future. I feel like the lame, patronizing adult saying all this but really, if I had the opportunity to go back and speak to my 18 year old self, this is what I would say, I would beg myself to never touch that stupid fucking plant. 

You can do this, you can quit. But you also need to evaluate all of your drug use. I know you're young and having fun, I get that. But sit down one night and really reflect on what drugs are providing you and ask yourself, in 10 years what will this look like. Most of my friends managed to escape that time in our lives unscathed and most are functioning adults without any dependencies. But some didnt, some ended up making really poor life decisions that have continued to effect them into adulthood, some succumbed to drug use, and then there's me, addicted to pot. 

You can do this. You can quit!"

Growing up, I loved all things BOY. I didnt necessarily want the body of a boy, I wanted what I considered the ""perks"" of being a boy/man. I noticed from a very young age that certain activities/ skills/talents better served boys than girls. For instance, I played hockey but I understood that I would never play in the NHL or even play a big important game in front of a crowd who actually saw worth in womens hockey, it just doesnt have the same draw.... I noticed it with comedians too, as I so badly wanted to be a comic, but again, comedy is not received the same way when coming from a woman. I noticed it elsewhere as well, especially as I grew older and became aware of social constructs.... men held more power. 

I wanted to be a boy, well, as I said before, I wanted what I cconsidered the ""perks"" of a being a boy. The comfy clothes, the cool toys, rough play, less pressure to adhere to social standards of beauty (after all, I was not a ""beautiful"" girl, I liked my hair short and wore guys clothing into my 20's) but I always new I was a girl. I love my female body. I loved that, one day, when I grew up, I could carry and give birth to a baby .... something a man can never do. 

I will still dress in men's clothing, my hair has always been short, I rarely wear makeup and I enjoy many a thing that society would consider ""masculine,"" but I've never cared, mainly because my parents never placed any importance on it, they just let me be me. 

Perhaps you are transgendered, but perhaps you're not. There is nothing wrong with exploring all options and finding your authentic self. Even though I knew I didnt physically want to be a man, I knew I wanted the power that men hold in our society."

Depression and mental illness is not a black and white issue. I just tell people that when they want to remind me of ""how good I have it."" Thanks, I reflect daily on the privileges I have in my life, and it makes me feel like shit that it's not enough to pull me out of whatever the fuck this is that is on an endless cycle of repeat. It's my brain, it's my chemistry, it's my genetics, it's my life experiences, it's the daily pressures plus more that effect my brain. I AM grateful for all that I have, I truly am.

Effexor has an extremely short half life of 5 hours (especially compared to other SSRI antidepressants)  which means its peak therapeutic effect is at 5 hours. The nausea could very well be related to missing a dose (if it were any other SSRI I'd say likely not) 

Have you been experiencing ""brain zaps"" or ""brain shivers?"" You'll know what I'm talking about if you've had them, lol. This is a very common SSRI withdrawal symptom. 

Just take your next scheduled dose and if you want to stop all together I would speak to your physician first. All the best. 

Oh and as for treating the nausea, take some Pepto or Gravol (the gravol may make you a bit drowsy.) Drink lots of fluids and eat some toast or broth."

Keep in mind, it isn't from lack of sleep in the case of chronic pot smokers, it's the fact that REM is suppressed by pot  

REM sleep is believed to benefit learning, memory, and mood. Which means there can be huge implications for those who smoke daily."
