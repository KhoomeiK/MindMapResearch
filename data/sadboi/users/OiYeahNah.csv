I was doing mostly front end work with React.js in my first job and have been mostly front end, but have also dabbled with Node.js and a few other technologies since. Once learning one tech it does become easier to learn others.

My first job was a bit different to others in my cohort. I decided to head over to Vancouver straight after the course and tried my luck at getting a dev job there, unfortunately it did not work out, so when I returned 6 months later I took the first job I was accepted into as I needed the money. The relationships you build through the course and the people you meet immensely improve your chances of finding a job - I had been accepted into the role here before I had even left Vancouver.

My starting salary was $55k. It was a startup and that is what I was on as a real estate agent, so I was happy just to be doing something I enjoyed more and get paid the same amount. Some in my cohort received a larger salary, but between us it mostly fell between $45-70k.

After just a few months I had an opportunity for another role. I was mostly just entertaining the opportunity to see where it went. I made it through the interview process successfully and managed to score a pay rise to $70k, along with other benefits, less hours and less travel time."

I also believe that being quite a personable guy due to around 10 years doing different customer service roles definitely helped; soft skills are equally, if not more important for a junior in the industry.

It can be a bit tricky to get that first role, however where I studied I got a Diploma at the end of it and an internship which gave me the first taste of commercial experience. Some of the others I studied with were hired by the company they interned at, some did not, but that certainly benefited a lot of people.

Personally, I went with a bootcamp after struggling to teach myself as I needed to be a bit more ""hands on"" with the learning.

If you can teach yourself how to code, massive props to you, I just saw a great amount of benefit in smashing out the full-time course in a 6 month period; absolutely no regrets there.

fiaustralia,fpn3i1s,t3_gee94e,1588749020.0,"Hey mate, I was in a similar situation, except I was a real estate agent bottom-feeder.

Uni was never for me and could not image giving it another crack spending the next 4 years studying and going back to casual bar work or whatever. I found a coding bootcamp which would teach me necessary job-ready skills in 6 months, so I quit my job and made the career change at 24.

Now at 26, I am significantly happier, make more than I ever had and didn't have to do 4+ years of uni to get here.

I'm not saying to do programming if it is not an interest of yours, but there definitely are other options out there.

Hey mate, it can be a bit overwhelming starting something like this when going from a site like Code Academy.

In the programming world, we have the Holy Grail known as Google to fix almost every problem we encounter, as well as having forums like [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and this subreddit.

I am relatively new to the programming world (1 year commercial experience as Jr Dev), but I strongly recommend getting into the habit of googling everything. That might seem a bit too obvious, but that really is the case.

It might seem easier to post a general question and wait for an answer, but you wouldn't believe how easy it is to find what you're looking for just by punching in a few words in Google.

First, by searching how to set up a react-native application, I stumbled across [this post](https://dottedsquirrel.com/react/how-to-set-up-react-native/). This goes over the basics of setting up a new application (You may want to briefly look into [Expo](https://expo.io/)) and if that still doesn't make sense, what should you do? That's right, give it a good ol google (hint: ""Expo vs react native"" or ""What is expo react native"").

Now that you've got the react-native setup sorted, next is Apollo and GraphQL.

It would be good to have a brief understanding of what each is and why it is necessary (Google that shit, yo). You don't have to know the ins and outs of both as it can be very overwhelming at first when diving into new, foreign technologies, so a basic understanding will suffice at the moment, you will learn more as you go.

Hopefully once you get an understanding of each, you now have the ability to figure out how to get those working with the react-native project. It is rare for a technology not to have a docs section, with most having an easy-to-follow guide to setting up whatever it may be; definitely look into those.

Goodluck!"
