If you didn’t know the reasons I got them, you’d think I was just a basic bitch. The rose I got for myself in the aftermath of an emotionally abusive relationship, as a reminder that I would never let someone treat me that way again. The butterfly was for a college roommate who OD’d, because butterflies were her favorite. On more than one occasion, I’ve had guys who I’ve hooked up with make fun of my basic bitch tattoos. It’s obnoxious af, but I usually get the last laugh when I tell them the butterfly is for my dead roommate and watch their face go from mocking to horrified. 😂It’s such a pet peeve of mine when people feel like they’re owed an explanation about YOUR body."
AmItheAsshole,fmv4xg9,t3_fx931l,1586406190.0,"Info- OP do you know her background? I just ask because she almost sounds like she was homeschooled. I was not homeschooled, but I was in catholic schools and friends with a LOT of homeschoolers. I think it’s worth mentioning that depending upon what her upbringing was, she could have had a VERY steep learning curve. I grew up in predominantly white suburbs going to small catholic schools (and not the kind with the daddy issues and partying, the kind where everyone there has zero social skills and our parents wanted the religious education and could give two shits about anything else)... I went from a very sheltered environment with pretty much zero interaction with poc to an urban university in a predominantly black city. 

And I fucked up along the way with my learning curve- I remember one time at one of our freshman welcoming events, the older students had arranged a surprise shaving cream fight. Good times, until I grabbed a handful and almost got some in my black roommate’s hair. Boy did I get an earful. And at the time I couldn’t understand it, here I was, covered from head to toe in shaving cream like everyone else, so why the hell was she freaking out at me about her hair? Like I literally had zero concept of what black women’s hair entailed with the care required. The only reason I bring up this embarrassing anecdote is that shit gets weird when you go from super sheltered white kid to adult actually interacting with other diverse humans. Like if she went to a normal high school and shit, then she should get her shit together. But the learning curve for some people is pretty rough if their upbringing didn’t allow for normal growth on this issue. 

And don’t get me started if you’re fighting against the sheltered upbringing AND toxic racist relatives, because then you’re unlearning awful shit on top of it. Like my relatives aren’t cross burning Klan level racist, but they’re definitely Fox News black on black crime level racist. It took awhile to rewire my brain. And it feels weird to try and rewire it, because it goes against what you’re brought up with and at the same time you’re scared to ask people for advice because you don’t want them to know you have to relearn this shit, it’s embarrassing af. Idk why I went on this rant, I’m several beers in and I don’t think I’ve ever admitted this to anyone let alone on the interwebz... quarantine got me fucked up.

Honestly it’s what scares me if I am ever in a situation where I feel like I have to come forward about my attacker... he’s a well liked good Christian lawyer so I’m sure I’d get thrown under the bus. Hell, I’ve already been thrown under the bus. Told a good friend about what happened and begged him not to go to this person’s wedding... he went anyways. And for the sake of our friendship I just had to let it go. I’ve had to let so many things go, when I’m not fine, I don’t want to let it go, but I was more or less forced to or else risk losing friendships, risk my job, the list goes on and on.

Pingyang- her father reportedly said this: “As you know the Princess mustered an army that helped us defeat the Sui Dynasty. She participated in many battles, and her help was decisive in founding the Tang Dynasty. The Princess personally beat the drums and rose in righteous rebellion to help me establish the dynasty…She was no ordinary woman.” https://sheroesofhistory.wordpress.com/2014/10/02/princess-pingyang-no-ordinary-woman/ 

Kwahlah bint-al-Azwar- “She fought side by side with her brother Zirrar in many battles, including a decisive Battle of Yarmouk in 636 against the Byzantine empire.” https://military.wikia.org/wiki/Khawlah_bint_al-Azwar

Freydís Eiríksdóttir- murdered people with an axe, not a sword, but you get the idea. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyd%C3%ADs_Eir%C3%ADksdóttir

Tomoe Gozen- “Her weapons of choice were actually the long sword and the bow and arrow.” https://www.tofugu.com/japan/tomoe-gozen/

Order of the Hatchet- used hatchets and other weapons. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Hatchet

I’ll admit, I’m an avid history nerd and I haven’t heard of most of these women (kudos to the author). But there’s a reason for that- history was largely written by a small demographic (white men* at least in the West) and most of us here in the US are coming from educations where that viewpoint controls a lot. It’s the reason we don’t learn about the extent of the brutality of slavery, or the widespread massacres that happened during the reconstruction (generally speaking, if you just had basic HS/undergraduate courses). But I get annoyed by laziness- we have entire encyclopedias at our fingertips with the internet, and it is so EASY to look up this shit and see how sexist BS like from the Daily Wire bro is factually incorrect.

If/when the time comes that the shit becomes too thick to ignore, gloating or going I told you so is not going to bring them back into the fold. They just need to come to grips with it on their own. So I bite my tongue (mostly) and wait for that to happen. 

As hard as it is, try not to be too upset with your mom. A lot of good people have been gaslit by this sociopath, and it will do more harm to push them away then it will to just quietly support them.

All of your complaints center around the women’s level of attractiveness, NOT who she is as a person. Your complaint is not women don’t like you, it’s **attractive** women don’t like you.  Notice how your complaint about being set up centered around your date’s looks, **not** compatibility or personality. You seem to have one criteria for dating, and it’s looks. Guess what bub, looks are fucking temporary, but that shit personality of yours could be permanent if you don’t do some soul searching. Maybe that date was the sweetest, most caring and wonderful person on earth, but you wouldn’t know it because you were too busy whining about how she didn’t rise to your impeccable standards. 

You’re not owed a hot woman. I’m not owed a hot man. Do I want to date someone who looks like Hugh Jackman? You bet your fucking ass I do, but I also know that hot guys usually have egos and I would rather have someone who is marginally attractive with a stellar personality over a male model with a shit personality.

Also your venom towards these girls husbands is truly disturbing. Has it occurred to you at all that maybe they love one another? And I mean actually love one another, not your weird version of love where you don’t really love those women you just want to possess them. Because if you did care for those women, you’d want them to be happy. 

I mean this in all seriousness my dude- maybe talk this one out with a therapist. And I don’t mean that in a condescending “lol you’re crazy” way, even though some of my comments are harsh. I mean that in a “Hey therapy can be genuinely helpful for toxic thoughts and I would know because I’ve been” kind of way. I was super bitter towards my ex after an emotionally abusive relationship, and talking it out brought me to a healthier place. I would recommend looking into it.

But sure, let’s say she was more like one of the Jewish people in the camps... you did have some Jews who betrayed their brothers and sisters, and guess what? Still a dick move, despite the fact that they’re being brutalized as well.

June’s made dumb decisions, but she’s never proactively handed someone over to get murdered. She’s bungled her escape attempts, made horrible choices, but all actions outside state sanctioned behavior carry risk. Literally every character is risking something or someone the moment they step out of bounds, but that is to be expected and completely different that handing someone over to be slaughtered when you aren’t even in any danger at the moment. 

People were rooting for Nick because we believed he had genuinely changed, and we were hoping for a redemption arc. People are happy about OfMatthew’s comeuppance because SHE MURDERED A WOMAN. Let’s not forget too... she murdered a woman, and got... what? Shoulder bumped? Cry me a freaking river."

Let’s put this into historical context, shall we?

The Czechs were brutalized by the Nazis when they took over. They suffered immensely at their hands, and surely large swaths of the population were traumatized.

HOWEVER.

If a Czech person (even one that was brutalized) snitched on a Jewish person in hiding- knowing for certain that their words would condemn that person to a terrible death- then that person is an asshole, full stop, and I would not feel bad for them if karma caught up in the form of this person’s neighbors being mean. 

OfMatthew knew her actions would condemn that Martha to death, and she did it anyway. “But Aunt Lydia told her to!!” AND??? Who gives a flying fuck??? The Nazis told people to turn in the Jews, it doesn’t mean you did it!

Yeah, trauma is messy and internalized misogyny is a helluva drug, but excusing bullshit like OfMatthew’s because she’s been through a lot is just a crutch. At some point, trauma is not an excuse for you to do whatever the fuck you please and you should still have a sense of right and wrong. And it is not internalized misogyny to feel a little schadenfreude at someone who did such a terrible thing- boohoo, some of the Handmaids were mean to her. 😢 Spare me. Their mean girl antics were downright MILD compared to what me and my sister put each other through during the holidays, and we freaking love each other!"

There’s zero remorse, probably because he’s one of these little rich kid sociopaths that genuinely thinks he didn’t do anything wrong. He can burn for all I care."
unpopularopinion,etf19j8,t3_cbeztr,1562756372.0,"If he accepted any responsibility for what he did, I might see your point. But he didn’t. His family didn’t. They continue to whine about poor Brock, waaahhh his life is ruined, blah blah blah. Like bro, if you REALLY wanted people to stop hating you, you’d own up and offer a mea culpa, but you continually deny any responsibility. 

I mean for the sake of argument, if I had gotten wasted and raped someone, and that act wasn’t reflective of who I am (I tend to dismiss the idea that booze affects people so badly that they normally aren’t rapists, but now they’re rapists when blasted... I’ve been black out drunk before, never has it occurred to me to have sex with someone who’s unconscious but I digress)... but let’s say that was the case.

I would be so fucking horrified that I had done this, so completely devastated that I hurt another human being like that, that there’s no WAY I would have proceeded to trial. My ass would have copped to it and taken a plea deal, and then I would have gone and sat in prison because I was raised that you take responsibility for your actions. 

My family? Holy shit, there’s no WAY my parents would try to explain that away before a judge. My parents wouldn’t even cover for me in middle school when I wanted them to give an excuse for a missed assignment... they were like “You want us to risk our reputation for your book report? Nah girl, get your butt in there and take that L.” 

But since there was not only no accountability or remorse (just crocodile tears for himself), he can continue to enjoy the shitstorm that HE created. Americans love a good redemption story, but you have to ask for forgiveness to get redemption and he has not."

But even then- I’m not sure they could have charged him with something. Maybe menacing or harassment, but it’s unclear if the statute in that state would have allowed for it, if harassment has to be part of a pattern and not an isolated incident. It probably would have been worth getting a record of that so if he was a suspect in other cases or there was a pattern of behavior, then there would be a paper trail. 

But it’s frustrating because it’s like wow, even if I had gotten the police on the phone and somehow they had apprehended him, I’m not sure they could have done anything."

It appears the train is traveling northwest along the bank of the Potomac, with a clear shot of the Monument with the river and the Jefferson Memorial. You can’t get that shot from those train tracks, that angle would have you looking up the Potomac as you head into the city, not across it from the point of view on one of the banks. You can get that shot along GW Parkway as it follows the river (where the Mount Vernon trail is), but that section definitely doesn’t have tracks there. 

I drive that section of GW all the time so I was laughing to myself like “Well I guess they destroyed the Parkway?? But also they’re headed towards ARLINGTON you’re going in the wrong direction guys!!” 

TL;DR I might be detail oriented to the point of OCD."

If you ever get up to DC, definitely visit the Archives to see the Declaration and the Constitution... I was so moved when I saw it for the first time.
