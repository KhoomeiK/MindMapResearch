For me it was awkward and the therapist just sat there and didn’t say anything but hi and how are you, so I wasted the 5 free therapy sessions in silence.

All I can say is you should wear headphones, have your volume up, take deep breaths and if you have a noisy family, ask them to please keep their voices down. I’m starting to feel a little anxious for you, I hope it all goes well! Good luck! ❤️"

AskReddit,fr5ac4y,t3_gmraet,1589905247.0,"I vividly remember at 2 years old burning the skin off my feet, legs, back of my thighs and under my butt. I had turned on the water in tub like I saw my mom do, didn’t take my clothes off and sat in the tub. I had turned on the hot water only and burned myself badly. I only remember it, I think, because I had been so angry that my aunt (who was watching me and her son, and was high at the time) wouldnt let me have a bath, so toddler me thought, “Fuck that bitch, I’m having a bath! I know how to do it!” And I also remember and can still feel the pain of the hot water burning me; it felt so hot that it started to feel like cold water (that’s the only way I can describe it). My cousin had to get my aunt because I was in there for awhile (I hadn’t plugged the drain thank god) and I was screaming my head off, and this bitch and her friends were high as fuck ignoring the two toddlers in other rooms.

I recently learned that my aunt was too paranoid to help my mom take me to the hospital and my mom had to drive, by herself, with me in the front seat because she was afraid more of my skin would peel off. She had one had on me so I wouldn’t roll onto the floor and the other to steer - she said I was bleeding badly and bottomless and red and all my skin was gone because my aunt had taken me out the tub and immediately pulled these thermal bottoms I had on and ripped whatever skin I had left off. She said my aunt had heard her come home like two seconds after she got me out the tub, took my bottoms and diaper off and then shoved me into my mom’s arms and said, “She burned herself.” and went back to entertaining her friends.

The last memory I actually vividly recall is me sitting in the tub and feeling the hot water start to turn cold while I screamed for my cousin. Yeah, my cousin said he remembered me screaming his nickname. Now I don’t grow hair on the back of my thighs, I have large brown freckles on my feet and ankles, and there’s a line permanently scarred on my legs to how high the water got since I never plugged the drain. OH and my mom took tons of pictures, too, I was one cute ass/stubborn toddler."

There was a family of 5 across the street from us and the two older boys, about 16-17, would come outside when me and my sister and cousins were outside playing, and laugh, point and bring their friends and call us welfare babies. We never told my mom until my older sister’s friends saw them throwing  pebbles at me and my little sister, and the old ass racist neighbor with one leg standing out by his truck and encouraging them. My mom went to their houses the next day and told them off (she cussed out that one legged man and mocked him for having one leg too, it was fucked up) and basically “threatened” the family across the street that they shouldn’t pick on the kids on welfare because they don’t know who their mom could get to fuck up their life.

So yeah, I learned we were the only people on the block that bought ice cream with paper food stamps in the summer. Before that, I assumed everyone had a mom that sold drugs and bought food with brown and blue paper called food stamps."

u_Xtina641,fql6ni8,t3_giua0g,1589448107.0,"I don’t know how if she was there that there wasn’t any evidence of her there, like more fingerprints. A 13 year old somehow tapes up a big ol man to a chair without a struggle and without getting her fingerprints or her hair folliciles or sweat anywhere near him? I call bullshit. Perhaps she was a witness since her grandma picked her up, possibly with her brothers, and decided right then was the perfect time to rob the neighborhood drug dealer since he was alone. Maybe she was made to go inside, they didn’t want her to get any attention or want her to run (?) and made her help by ripping up some duct tape while the brothers ransack the house and grandma watches and continues to duct tape Cookie until the robbery was done. 

That’s just my theory. She was a kid and as a kid she does what her elders tell her to.

Or maybe it’s a case of Angel hanging out with her grandpa one day and playing with the tape, like unraveling parts (maybe) then rolling it back and messing around with it, getting her prints on it. Or she could’ve been messing with it while bored and had one of her brothers or grandma snatched it from her and then used it in the robbery. 

I dunno, it’s just my opinion. The tape part is really hard to challenge, but I’ve had moments of playing with things like tape, but I would rip it off and throw it away before putting it away, so I don’t know. I don’t think she had a role in actually taping up that man and being the cause of his death. I do think her family members, especially her grandma, knows what happened and since she didn’t get along with Angel and the fact Angel is young, letting her take the fall for what they did is probably what she thinks is the best. It’s horrible though, why let her grandchild, who has children of her own, go to prison until she’s as old, if not older, as she is?

And if Angel did have some tiny part in it, I wish she’d just tell, but I know the whole “no snitching” and the fact “snitching” on her family is a bigger no no."
