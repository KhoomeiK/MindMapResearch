Those are all really understandable reasons to turn to drinking, I know I drank a lot and did drugs to forget about my bipolar and social anxiety a lot too. Not to say medication is the answer to everything for everyone, but I can say that drinking made my meds straight up not work. Getting on the right meds and doses and therapy really turned things around for me. That can be a battle on its own but a worthwhile one (for me)

Sounds like we both struggle with brain chemistry..Alcohol just throws a wrench in the works I think. Maybe it might be nice to check in with your therapist and talk healthier coping skills, it helped me so much! :)

Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but stay safe going to parties while staying sober. Sobriety changed my social life, and for better or worse, it meant that I had to avoid my usual places and people.

You may notice a bigger difference if you struggle with depression especially, since alcohol can worsen depression which may lead to more drinking. I have BP so drinking heavily affected me. 

I noticed a mental clarity as well though, like this hazy cloud cleared. My inner coping skills improved over time, my relationships are better. My body feels better, I lost a couple alcohol fluff pounds too.

I make better decisions in all walks of life, my sense of judgment is better. I’m just a better version of me :)

You may consider asking yourself why you binge drink at parties, maybe something else is going on outside of social drinking. No judgment from me of course just that’s how it was with me and how it started. Maybe consider not drinking for a period of time and see if you feel better :)"

I mean, it doesn’t make me feel any type of way like a benzo does. No psychoactive effects - it just helps sever the brain/body connection in a good way. It slows my heart rate and reallyyyy cuts the adrenaline rushes down.

When something happens that normally gets my adrenaline going, propranolol significantly reduces the racing heart, shaking, voice cracking, paranoia, etc. I struggle with SAD a lot, so I love taking one before work or a social outing. I can focus more on what I’m doing and my brain listens to my calm body. It helps the racing thoughts and everything without numbing me. I feel more like myself! :) I react to stress in a normal way (more normal) and freak out less.

I’m only speaking for myself and a few others with whom I’m close: these are our signs of depression. Isolation is a sign, and it can increase depression and anxiety over time. I’ve been sucked into this thought pattern many times. I think it’s important to have safe people who help keep you sane, not totally put up your walls and isolate. I’ve been watching my mom do exactly this lately, and I’ve been gently nudging her to come be social. She hesitates initially but when she does socialize with safe people, she’s been getting better over time. 

Push away shitty people, not all people. Keep yourself safe, but let good people in. Keep some at an arms length, but not everyone. Have some good social boundaries. I’ve been burned so many goddamn times I never wanted to talk to anyone again. Closing myself off completely only hurt me more... not everyone is bad! It’s so hard to give people a chance, but better boundaries has made my socialization better.

Disordered eating, body dysmorphia, weight fluctuations, obsession, etc. have been a part of my life for over 10 years. It may interest you to know that bipolar women are more likely to struggle with these problems too.

Gaining weight has been a side effect of being in recovery from my eating disorder and bc of my meds, and while I’m still within a healthy weight range for my height, seeing a different body is painful sometimes.

I can only speak for myself but you might ask yourself if these fixations on your appearance may be a manifestation of your inner turmoil. This concept is fairly well accepted in the ED community. I’m not saying you have an ED or body dysmorphia, but maybe you can relate to that like I do. Being unhappy with my appearance is usually a reflection of being unhappy with myself. You mentioned it yourself, that you sometimes wish to be anybody but you.

I have seen many reflections - very underweight, extremely fit, healthy, and my current softer figure lol. When I had what I thought was the “perfect” body, I was more miserable than I’d ever been and hated what I saw in the mirror. It was surprising and heartbreaking. I wanted control over my body but what I really needed was control of myself. 

I am awful about picking apart any pic of myself, and I was really pleasantly surprised that a recent pic taken of me I didn’t overanalyze or critique. Despite being heavier than I’ve ever been as an adult, I didn’t even think about my body in a negative way or whether or not I looked okay or beautiful or ugly - all I could see was how happy I was with my SO’s arm around me.

It’s no coincidence that the most at peace I felt with a pic of me, was a pic of me looking stupidly happy and loved. A pic of me where my meds are much better managed, a pic of me with months of therapy in my life, a pic of me without substance abuse, without an ED. A genuine smile. I can see the weight on my face and it’s not the “best” pic of me but I just don’t even care bc it’s the happiest pic of me to date.

Sorry about my novel, but the point I’m trying to make is that taking care of my inner self has led to accepting and loving my outer self. You are beautiful and amazing. Listen to the people telling you so. Take control of your mind bc focusing on changing your body isn’t going to ultimately make you happier with who you are. At least that’s been a huge life lesson for me personally! I hope this helps a little"

Do I need to reconsider my love for her?"
