rant,f5807qk,t3_dn5grz,1572046332.0,"I find those on top like supervisors, managers can be a danger to the employees well being. Get one that takes any critical opinion as a personal attack on them and kiss your sanity good bye. That’s what I feel right now at work. I’ve already had five different managers in the same company for the past 10 years!! Oh, shitty company owners too. Cant get a real fucking manager."

I wish you good luck in the army."
SuicideWatch,f3xq9yh,t3_dili0p,1571242252.0,"I sometimes feel hollow and so much apathy towards everything. If I lived alone I wonder if I would spend my days living on the couch or bed all day. I just don’t want to leave my room, what’s the purpose of stepping out for anyway."
SuicideWatch,f3xoo3r,t3_d71ue7,1571241555.0,"Smiling hurts but it’s a requirement at work. Greet patrons and don’t forget to smile. I can’t do it anymore. I can’t deal with the whims of every new manager every two years. I don’t even know who the fuck is the manager now! Is it the one I see at work, or the caller that gives out orders? Work has driven me mad."
