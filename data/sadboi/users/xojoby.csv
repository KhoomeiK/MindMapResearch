Some can be intelligent, some can't due to their struggles in context.

Some are but can't express their intelligence due to anxiety, cptsd, dissassociation, etc. 

You could say those with mental handicaps are less likely to be intelligent, but that statistic is hard to argue considering the world consist of people who are stable, people who are mentally ill, and people who are and don't realize it.

A different way I can look at this is, yes they can be more intelligent, obvious example:
Elon Musk, I am a huge admirer of him, and he may very well be the Einstein of our generation.. yet his social cues, and appearances scream social anxiety."

Climate control, gun control, especially with the rise of white nationalism which is being promoted by the president himself.

Even after that, other issues are still more important than tackling immigrants; free health care being a human right, government reform, college; but you know... Just leave me and my awesome guns alone, you [insert insulting name calling] /s"
