cymbalta,f30srzl,t3_deycjo,1570561647.0,Please do some research first. Go to the Facebook page called Cymbalta hurts worse. Horrendous outcomes for people that have been on it. Class action lawsuits against the pharmaceutical companies with probably more to come. I thought it was great at first but then I realized it was damaging my brain function. I am finally off of it and for me I can tell you what I was going through before medication was not nearly as bad as being on it or the awful withdrawal from it.  That being said please look up the book- The Mood Cure by Julia Ross a nutritionist specializes in temporary amino acid therapy for anxiety and depression. There is enough info online to see if this method is for you!  Good food and exercise is critical but some of our bodies are ‚Äòlow‚Äô in essentials and this helps to ‚Äòfill the tank‚Äô. Miraculous for me and so many others. Not exaggerating and I have no tie to the book other than gratitude.  Really supports dopamine and serotonin supplies.  I SWEAR IT SAVED ME. now I am happy and a pleasure to be around.
cymbalta,f2r40o6,t3_ddysmi,1570369543.0,"You are absolutely correct. For anyone who wishes to rid yourself of Cymbalta please don‚Äôt listen to the doctors that will lower you with big jumps because that‚Äôs the only way the pharmaceutical companies offer to lower the doses and that‚Äôs the way the pharmaceutical companies tell the doctor so that‚Äôs all most of them know. There is a page on Facebook called Cymbalta hurts worse. Please read all the information they have to offer.  In their files they explain a really good way to taper slowly.  It is the best way of doing it. A little tedious but well worth it.  Cymbalta withdrawal is real and it can be devastating to the person, their family and their job.  Typically because it is not expected. Doctors don‚Äôt know about it because they haven‚Äôt been through it.  People think oh gosh I‚Äôm crazy without the meds and then they end up back on the medicine or on another one when in fact they just need to get through the terrible withdrawal. It can take up to a year to get it out of your system. Some people claim long-term bad effects For those of you happily on Cymbalta like I was please be alert for changes in your memory, in your thought process, in your ability to concentrate and be articulate. Do your research and find out the various negative effects and watch out for them. Best to all involved in this drug."

hsp,f227ni1,t3_dbi9is,1569883620.0,"I don‚Äôt know yet,  I am still a work in progress.  There are ways to rise above it but you have to be able to see it with your big brain so to speak. Also sometimes those feelings can be exacerbated by our nutrition not being perfect which is easy for most of us. That‚Äôs a very basic answer but it boils down to being depleted in things that our body makes/has, but sometimes it needs a little help from the outside. Please look up the Mood Cure by Julia Ross a nutritionist specializes in temporary amino acid therapy.  There is enough info online to see if this is for you.  But I can tell you 100% amino acid therapy can help with over sensitivity. I will always be a highly sensitive person BUT I feel better now because I think clearly while including my emotions.  When you can control all that you can use your sensitivities for better use."
cymbalta,f225cnv,t3_dbgbme,1569882235.0,"Sorry no good news here for you on drinking with Cymbalta. Total times of blackout even on smaller amounts of alcohol. It‚Äôs not a good sign of what‚Äôs happening in your brain that we don‚Äôt know about. Cymbalta also causes some serious alcohol cravings so it could make you want to drink even more. I don‚Äôt think you should drink at all while you‚Äôre on this medication. But if you‚Äôre going to ignore the old lady who knows better, please be smart take a friend with you tell them what‚Äôs going on with you and get them to help you limit your intake because it may be hard to do it yourself and you have to have somebody to make sure you get home OK.  Please think about all your years ahead of you not just the fun you need to have right now.  Please let me add that you should never stop that medication cold turkey it can be devastating to your body and your mind and everybody around you. If you need help with that go to the Facebook page Cymbalta hurts worse. There you can learn how to taper slowly so you can still function while weaning off of it.   Of course you should talk to your doctor but they typically will wean people the way that they were taught and that does not work in reality it has to be much slower. Best of luck to you."
