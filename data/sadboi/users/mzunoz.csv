I think it’s the same? But it grew over night. I’m super scared to tell my mom. I can’t even go to the store because I can’t drive and there’s no where walking distance. So I’m lost at this point. I’m feeling pain when I sit, and wiping especially. I’ve been trying to be extra extra clean and careful when showering and getting no soap near. But I don’t know what to do."

birthcontrol,fnsp0y8,t3_fogl4j,1587226045.0,"Hello, I’m so sorry you are experiencing this. I am a 16F, I experienced the same effects as you, but never as severely as you are describing. I just got my second shot yesterday. My mother refused to take me the 11 weeks after so I wasn’t consistent with the every 11 weeks. Are you able to see an adolescent specialist? That is where I was recommended to get the depo. I had my period 97 days straight and just yesterday they stopped right after I got the shot. I am on Prozac 10mg and my psychiatrist is straight shit, and she didn’t believe my medication “wasn’t working” so makes me feel better I am not the only one who feels this way. This may not help, but know you are not alone. Hope you have a nice day!:)"
