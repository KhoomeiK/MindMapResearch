bipolar2,fodzc05,t1_fodqfb0,1587692990.0,"Thank you for being so kind in your answer!! I feel like you felt: definitely sure I have it but not wanting to seem drug seeking. As I'm doing grad school, it makes me self conscious as I may seem drug seeking from my psych. My pysch actually had me fill out a questionnaire once for adhd and I scored high on it but he never medicated me for it!! I'm only on Lamictal. BTW, I was also admitted to the pysch ward but the care there wasn't great. I asked this same question to someone else and they said that they had to pay a lot of money for the diagnosis. Yikes. Are you in the US? I want to know if that's just a US thing. (I'm outside of the US)."
bipolar2,fo99m67,t3_g67ruq,1587613786.0,Can tell describe your diagnosis journey? :) asking as a person who might have adhd but doesn't know how to approach with it pysch.

SkincareAddiction,fn057lk,t3_fyc4oe,1586535659.0,"Congratulations, your skin looks great! I have a few somewhat noob questions. Is it OK to use HA in hot and humid climates? I was worried that it would dry me out in the tropical climate I live in. Also, what does b5 help with? And finally, what's the retinol product in your routine. Thanks :)

Edit: I see the retinol produce now ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

adultsurvivors,fmlf6dr,t1_fmkc5p4,1586185182.0,"Yes, it does. It starts you on a long and scary journey towards healing :) the first time I said it was on a forum about my favourite book series when I was 14. Just to say it and for someone to know. My body shook and my hands went cold. It was hugely triggering. But after I was able to tell someone when I was 17, then 18 and so on and now today, you see it's easier for me :)"
KindVoice,fmjo2dc,t3_fvladq,1586134226.0,You are genuinely suffering so you should tell them. They should be aware of all what's going on with the situation. You're not the only one. Good luck! I hope you feel better. You can do it.
adultsurvivors,fmjnr5v,t3_fvo0t9,1586134046.0,"I second the other comment about it may be being PTSD. Hey, I don't how to help it but I can say I was 7 when I was raped too and I'm 25 now and I was 100% trapped in the memory of it for at least 11 years. But now I go weeks without thinking about it, so I understand what you're going through and I know you'll get through it :)"

Skincare_Addiction,fjymhvp,t3_fb994m,1583699941.0,It makes sense. I know lots of men who don't use any skincare products and their faces are fine. I've gone through periods where I've stopped using any products and my face gets better! And other times it doesn't. (Part of the reason I feel so frustrated with skincare. I wish I just worked for me.)
2meirl4meirl,fiizhbw,t3_f7ee0u,1582430908.0,"Try going to an animal shelter and asking to volunteer with the cats there. If there's a cat cafe in your area, that's also an option. Other option is going by a friend who has a cat and playing with them. Cats are helpful for depression, etc but my apartment is too small to get one so I try to interact with cats in other ways."
2meirl4meirl,fiiz6h0,t1_fiarg39,1582430674.0,Or at least some of that and get your parents to help with the rest? Good luck to you and your cat

It's not nice to do it alone, I know because I've done it since I was 7. I also told my mom because I wanted her to know me better and that felt like a second difficult momentous event. She didn't really do anything and she also said ""why didn't you stop it?"" and told me about a time someone tried to touch her as a child and she stopped it. Since then...she hasn't really tried to support me. Not getting the support you need is so awful and hard. *hugs*"
