Indeed, men may more innately have a lower frustration tolerance than women, but an inability to wait or delay gratification needn't be inevitable.

Sex and aggression are (generally speaking) inextricably linked in all mammalian male brains, and prosocial behavior is more rewarding in women than men, generally speaking; that's not an accident 

Either way however, the point stands; THIS IS NOT SET IN STONE. Tend and befriend are just as innate as might makes right, and environment will determine which is perpetuated more. No one worth their salt in evo psych (or any science for that matter) will say you're an 'evolutionary dead end' because you don't fit the antiquated ideal of times past, or whatever.

Yeah, you need all 6 characteristics in a functioning society, and there is no clean divide between 'real men' and 'soft boys' all the time. Like all traits though, they're subject to change, and will be brought out more in some environments than others.
