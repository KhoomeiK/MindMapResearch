My favorite memory is chocolate crinkle cookies. I liked baking them but mostly loved eating them 🤣"
SantasLittleHelpers,f88c5td,t3_dx9koi,1574352204.0,"The dream gift for all our kids is a game system. We currently have a Wii u but it has stopped reading disks and we can't afford to replace it so they can only play the one preloaded game since the network for it no longer exists. They didn't even specify which game system just something that they can all play together. (I'm registered with 4 kids, but I care full-time for two bonus kiddos) 

My kids are so very hard to describe. The oldest is 10 and the youngest is 4 which are my girls. In the middle is squished two boys ages 9 (on December 10th) and 7. 
They, as much as we try to shield them, know that money is tight. They also were raised to believe that Santa doesn't always bring electronics so they aren't expecting anything like their dream gift. 
They all love the outdoors and anything to do with animals. My oldest is all about ducks, my second oldest loves to fish and is Chewbacca obsessed. Then the next boy is all sports all the time. He loves baseball. The youngest is interested in EVERYTHING the big kids are interested in and puppies and horses 🤣 they may all be a little different in their own way but they are all amazing"

One activity we do on Christmas Eve is that we make reindeer food. It's basically oatmeal and magic. The magic being glitter. We sprinkle it out on the lawn before bed... The moon makes it look even more magical."

SantasLittleHelpers,f80s5u1,t3_dy8cxz,1574136820.0,"My oldest boy turns 9 on December 10th. We've always waited to put up the tree until after his birthday, and no joint Christmas/birthday presents are his main requests. Everyone else gets a separate celebration so he likes his too. 😁"

SantasLittleHelpers,f7btqvc,t3_duvqq8,1573577416.0,"Normally when things aren't so hectic we would get three board games or family games and wrap them up. We would open them slowly throughout the day taking turns on who got to unwrap and them we would play them. There was also a cookie making set, PJs for each kid, hotchocolate popcorn and a new Christmas movie, then last we would open our new Christmas Eve book. All wrapped separately.
It helped distract from the excitement of Christmas morning and is just a whole day of relaxing fun. 
Last year we couldn't do the board games and or kids actually picked their favorites from previous years and rewrapped them without telling us. So the tradition continued even when we couldn't really afford to do it like normal. ❤️"

ptsd,et8gt0o,t1_et87pvi,1562556052.0,"Sadly since starting support services for his diagnosis we've met several other children his age and even younger with the same diagnosis 😟

I will say though the services we have and the care teams we use our kids are thriving. We still have tough days... Sometimes even couple of days... But there's constant progress. 💕"
ptsd,et85cam,t1_et848qe,1562546956.0,"It took me a year to get my son, 8 yrs, the help he needed. He was spiraling and I was doing everything I could short of standing outside the drs screaming for help. I followed all the steps to get him help. No one took me seriously until my son had a manic episode and hit fight or flight with a police officer. Then everyone looked at us, his parents, like we were the issue and they needed to force us to get him help. 

The system is just so broken. It shouldn't take a extreme to get someone to listen."

Then when I went to turn around noticed my 3 yr old naked and climbing in it like her own personal water bucket. 😂 Clearly it's hot today"
SantasLittleHelpers,et82c7d,t3_aqxa73,1562544572.0,I had Samantha as my very first American girl doll. I absolutely loved her. Reading her books and knowing all about her life. At age 9 I had saved sooooo many months to buy her winter outfit with skates because I wanted to take Christmas pictures with her 😂 she was my prized possession for most of my childhood.
ptsd,et81weo,t3_cad9ku,1562544220.0,"I mostly lurk because I never seem to have time to do much else. I agree wholeheartedly and just wanted to add that I just wish it were easier to get the process started for mental health help. 

Getting the ball rolling to better ourselves or help those we love shouldn't be so hard."
