It’s important to start therapy early, in order to avoid some of the complications that can come from prolonged, untreated PTSD. It’s really important to have a professional support, because no one else will be able to help as effectively. 

It is very sweet of you to do this for her. One of the concerns with this, is that if an untrained person attempts to work through her trauma with her, that can result in her becoming retraumatized or putting herself in danger. Processing trauma has to be taken very seriously, and needs the help of a trained professional. This will be a long road for her, but she will get through it. I suggest that she tells an adult she trusts. 

In the meantime, let her know that she is not alone. It’s normal for her to feel how she does about this. She will get through this and have a happy life. I run a tumblr account for mental health awareness, and she is welcome to message me on there. My account is @ reveriesystem.

You aren’t losing your mind, and you aren’t crazy. It sounds like you brought up some trauma memories before you were equipped to handle them. It happens, and it’s going to be okay. 

Work on some grounding exercises. It sounds like you’re having body flashbacks, which means your mind is more quiet but your body is stuck in a different time. Spend some time observing your senses. Things you see, taste, touch, smell. Name them out loud to yourself. Talk to yourself, saying “My name is ____, it is May, 2020. I am (age) years old. I am safe.” These things help to bring your body out of the memory.

DID,fqdndsb,t3_giacuy,1589293171.0,"Hey! So the diagnosis of OSDD can mean that either 1) Your alters aren’t fully developed. So they might seem more like “extreme versions of yourself”. Or 2) You don’t have amnesia, so you don’t experience lost time or black outs. 

It is also common for people to not be able to recognize when they aren’t fronting. DID/OSDD are developed in order to keep us safe, and this disorder is meant to fly under the radar and go unnoticed, even to the host. That being said, no one here is a professional and you should definitely go to a therapist or psychiatrist and speak to them about it. There are other disorders that can cause similar symptoms, and it’s good to rule those out as well. 

If your friend has DID, it might help if you open up to them about your experience. Most of us have some idea of how DID works, and they might be able to help you. However, everyone’s experience is different, so one system’s experience doesn’t always match another’s."

DID,fqc2zop,t3_ghzvgv,1589249055.0,"Hey, friend.

I know it’s scary right now. You are going to be okay. NOBODY is too bad for therapy, and you are not crazy. if a therapist ever makes you feel that way, find a new one. You are never, never a lost cause. 

Your therapist sounds like they have some good experience, that’s great. What I can say is that if they’ve been in the game that long, it’s most likely that they care, and they are passionate about their field. No therapist is a 100% expert, and if you feel like they aren’t qualified, you have every right to get a second opinion. 

Trauma is really complicated. Our bodies sometimes know more than we do, and even though that doesn’t feel good, it’s important that we do what we can to create safety for ourselves. You may never know the truth, but that doesn’t change what you’re experiencing right *now*. This is your experience, and you deserve to heal from it. 

My advice is to focus on your symptoms. Don’t get too caught up in labels, because they don’t change your experience. It’s awesome to have the validation of a label, but if it’s doing you harm, there is no reason to attach too much to it. What matters is that this is your experience, you are struggling, and you deserve to receive help. 

If your therapist makes you feel safe, and they haven’t given you any other reasons to doubt them, I would give them some time. Give them the benefit of the doubt, assume that they know what they’re doing. As long as they aren’t causing you harm. 

No matter what name your mental illness falls under, it doesn’t change what you feel, and how you process the world. It sounds like you suffer from some trauma symptoms. Focus on that, and how you can create more safety for yourself. *You never have to process your trauma in order to have a happy life. You never have to relive it or remember it in order to learn how to cope and heal.* 

If you’re doing really poorly, look around for a trauma IOP program near you. The one I went to saved my life. I wish you luck."

ptsd,fq9wf5m,t3_ghjl0h,1589208377.0,"Sometimes therapists won’t tell you a specific diagnosis, because some believe that giving it a label makes you identify more with it.

There is nothing wrong with asking your doctor, “Am I diagnosed with anything?” I had to do that with my first doctor. 

If you have trauma that impacts your daily functioning, there’s a good chance that you meet the criteria for PTSD. However, only a professional can officially determine that. My recommendation is to just ask them, or ask for your file."

Most of my experience is like this. I am diagnosed with DID, because I do rarely have blackouts. However, most of my time switching is like this. I think of amnesia like a spectrum, because it varies in the level of memory that I can recall. Sometimes I can remember details when prompted, sometimes I only have a vague idea of what I did. Sometimes I can think back and know that someone else was fronting, but I can’t visualize any of the things they did (usually my memory is very visual, I recall memories as images).

ptsd,fpglobd,t3_gdd1rs,1588605120.0,"Woah that is *not* normal and *no* trained therapist should ever do that to you. 

During an intake, it’s normal for a therapist to ask you what your trauma was, and expect a simple answer such as “I had an accident”, or “I was sexually assaulted.” But they should NEVER ask you to relive or disclose details before you are ready. 

If they force you to disclose details, this can retraumatize you, ESPECIALLY if you don’t know any healthy coping mechanisms yet. 

My advice, if they pressure you to give them any more details than the basics, walk away. They should never be pressuring you that way, and they should never threaten not to treat you otherwise. If they do this, find a new therapist. Look for someone who is trauma-informed. 

You have every right to stand up and walk out of a session if you are ever uncomfortable. I’ve been in therapy for a long time, and I have never had a therapist force me to disclose the details."

All the way up to the “9 Step Process” everything is great. Those are all great ideas, especially about learning self regulation and seeing a trauma specialist. 

However, in the “9 Step Process” there is a part that tells you to “recall the trauma”. I cannot express how dangerous this can be if you don’t have a large toolbox of coping skills and a mental health professional to work with. This is the same reason you shouldn’t be cleared for EMDR if you have not built a foundation of coping skills. Pushing yourself to recall the trauma before you’re ready, could re-traumatize you, or put your well-being in danger. 

I would say, no harm will come from working on everything before that section. Eventually, once you have a good groundwork of coping skills, talk to a professional about trauma processing."

When I’m not at the front, I’m usually co-conscious. However, the memories of what another alter did are easily forgettable, and very cloudy. I can usually remember when prompted, but it would be easy for me to forget if no one reminded me. I only have 2-3 times that I know of where I found evidence of doing something that I had no recollection of. I stressed to him that those full blackouts are very rare. On top of that, when I am co-conscious with one of my alters, I have intrusive memories that are completely unfamiliar to me. That, I guess, is another major indicator of amnesia.

asexuality,fb9109n,t1_fb90x9p,1576626635.0,It’s basically a subtle way to be proud of our identities! It also helps other aces to recognize each other. Mine has a heart as well because I’m romantic ace.

ptsd,fb7ns8f,t3_ebqw0x,1576595113.0,15 mg remeron. Helps with sleep and depression.
menwritingwomen,fb7nkfc,t3_ebsx1r,1576594954.0,"This reminds me of a time in high school health class where we had 1 bandaid, and it symbolized having sex every time you stuck it to another person. The teacher had us all pass it around until it wasn’t sticky anymore and then made some stupid point about how sharing yourself too much made “the bandaid stop working” 🙄"
ShitMomGroupsSay,fb6k3mf,t3_ebpazw,1576552247.0,There’s a suspicious relation between being educated about medicine and also NOT being a psychic. Hmmm
asexuality,fb4qw8y,t3_ebgxje,1576513950.0,"It’s normal for sex to feel good because our bodies react physically to the stimuli. As someone else said, asexuality doesn’t directly relate to sex in that it’s a lack of sexual attraction, and not a dislike of sex. (Some aces are sex-repulsed but not all aces are). I’m in the same boat as you, sex feels good but I don’t seek it out or crave it."
ptsd,fb4e56a,t3_ebfs9k,1576507199.0,"I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I am going to tell you to be REALLY careful coming off any meds. Some meds cause pretty serious side effects if you aren’t weaned off them."
ptsd,fb3wwz8,t1_fb3ulkg,1576493686.0,"I have a feeling my yoga teacher training triggered it. We did a ton of “trauma work” and deep spiritual introspection and I wasn’t ready for it then. The people who did the yoga training were not psychological professionals, so for me it ended up being a really harmful thing. I just wasn’t ready at the time to open that door and it retraumatized me."
ptsd,fb3a5mg,t1_fb39ulb,1576467845.0,"You aren’t crazy. We’re all scared and confused, but that doesn’t mean you can’t keep putting one foot in front of the other. It’s a hell of a fight, but you ARE strong enough to do it. Please message me if you want to talk, I’ll be here."
ptsd,fb39bix,t1_fb38uin,1576467278.0,"It really really sucks but with PTSD it gets worse before it gets better. You’ve been pushing your trauma down and ignoring it for so long, and now the “can of worms” is open. It’s really common to feel worse when starting therapy. Hell, I barely even had symptoms before I started therapy. It’s important to remember that in the long run, this is the best way to go. If you keep ignoring it, it just comes back with a worse vengeance. In the long run, dealing with it now will give you so much more time to truly enjoy your life. 

I know it feels hopeless right now, but you can do it. Keep moving forward, friend. 

I felt the same way even 2 months ago when I got admitted. I have come so far since then. It will all start to make sense but you have to get through the mud. It’s a constant struggle, and I’m not going to tell you it isn’t. But you can do this. You can do this. Right now it’s about you."
ptsd,fb38gtd,t3_eb7gco,1576466700.0,I definitely deal with intrusive thoughts and when they pop up I physically shake my head as well. Almost like a reset button like “okay we’re not gonna think about that right now.”
ptsd,fb38bn1,t3_eb90xm,1576466600.0,"I was admitted to an intensive outpatient program after having a mental breakdown. I am telling you, no matter what, it is going to get better. I would not be alive right now if I didn’t get admitted. Do this for you. It’s time to take care of yourself. I wish you so much luck, and PM me if you want to talk more."
asexuality,fb2j6a9,t3_eaxtsc,1576452021.0,"I am in a happy relationship and recently got engaged. My partner is not ace, but I am. It depends on the person, but my boyfriend doesn’t have a problem with it. We both just “take care of it ourselves” if we ever feel aroused. I am also a sex-neutral ace, so eventually I plan to have sex with him on a more regular basis. So far, we haven’t had sex in 3 years and everything is fine."
ptsd,fb2ivko,t3_eaxyjs,1576451867.0,"My ptsd isn’t medical, but in regards to experience it in a delayed form, I relate. My trauma happened when I was 16. I suddenly, out of the blue “snapped” and started having severe ptsd at age 20. I think maybe my brain wasn’t ready to handle it until this year."
ptsd,fb0lham,t1_fb0l4t6,1576427105.0,"Oh I’m definitely not saying you’re asexual, but I definitely get what you’re saying. Do you know what derealization is? It might help to read a definition of it and see if that’s what you’re feeling. Anyway I really wish you the best of luck. It’s going to get better"
ptsd,fb0k3xe,t3_eb0e6h,1576426745.0,"I get it. I actually struggled for a long time because I pushed myself to keep having sex because it’s “what’s supposed to happen”. 

I recently realized I’m asexual, and that has helped me a lot because I no longer pressure myself to perform sexually. When I do have sex, I dissociate which makes me feel like I’m not connected to the other person. I also break out into random crying fits, which sucks a lot.

If it makes you feel better then go ahead, but don’t feel like you HAVE to have sex in order to please another person. It’s 100% okay to take some time away from it."

wowthanksimcured,fasyb64,t3_eag94u,1576332821.0,"Life has really kicked my ass, but honestly all I can do to keep staying alive is tell myself this. The post does come off as, “it’s just that easy!” which it totally isn’t. All I know is that I have to keep telling myself, “okay. One more day. One more step. Just keep going.”"

ptsd,fahnwth,t3_e9arrm,1576089783.0,"I completely understand this. I also think of it like a forest. There’s a gigantic fire there, and the treatment helps the fire get put out, but then you’re left with a bunch of burned trees and no greenery. So you basically have to start from square one replanting and regrowing. 

I feel like my trauma has changed me so much that now I need to relearn who I am."
asexuality,fafng2f,t3_e8zvwq,1576027175.0,"That’s a strange situation, and not really fair to you. 

No matter what, don’t let other people make you feel shameful for who you are. There isn’t really a reason that the mention of the word should make anyone uncomfortable, except that they are probably immature. 

I’m sorry this happened to you."
asexuality,faezz53,t1_faexlfj,1576011651.0,"It definitely is interesting. It doesn’t feel ~amazing~ to know that there are people who believe I am not spiritually in tune if I am asexual. I have a lot of learning to do in terms of where I stand with my own spirituality and my own self-validation. I’ve never been a religious person, but before I got sick I was very into spiritual philosophy and such."
asexuality,fael1gl,t1_faeknkv,1576002894.0,Thank you. That definitely makes sense. I can imagine that my OBGYN might be concerned if I say that I am in a long term relationship and I am not sexually active. They might want to test my hormones. I’ll have to think more about what to say in that situation.
ptsd,fabxzqx,t1_fabx68f,1575930566.0,"Honestly, that was most of it for me. I absolutely hated myself during that part of my life. I thought that I would be alone forever, and that was “the best I would ever get.” 

The other part of it was that he had this charm about him. He was dominant and straightforward. At the time, I liked that about him. That was what would rope me in every time."
asexuality,fab2qjy,t3_e829n5,1575916935.0,I find pleasure in sitting closely/cuddling and doing silly things. I also love hair pets.
asexuality,faaptk6,t3_e860j3,1575911975.0,"Best: Not having the self-imposed pressure to include sex in my life.

Worst: Lack of representation, difficulty accepting who I am."
