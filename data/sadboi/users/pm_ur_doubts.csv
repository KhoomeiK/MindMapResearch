DataArt,fnljax3,t1_fnjjux2,1587054518.0,"Interesting perspective I guess. Just because you aren’t affected by the greed of the rich doesn’t mean that there aren’t millions who can’t afford proper medical care, housing, and don’t have access to the same opportunities the “rich” are, when they likely work much harder. And that’s just in the USA, take the people around the world who are in this situation and you’ve got billions. It’s not just about “redistributing the wealth” it’s about realizing that the rich don’t get rich by their own labor but off the backs of others’ labor."
AskWomen,fmnnyz6,t3_fvzp3y,1586230618.0,"Had a close friendship in which I had feelings for them and they may or may not have had feelings for me. We had multiple fights but anytime they were in a crisis they would call me and I would immediately come to their aide. I’m not good with confrontation and after about 3 years of friendship, they called to tell me an “update” to one of their crisis, I carried on the conversation but decided after that it was no longer good for my mental health to keep them in my life. I dodged their calls, texts, and made excuses anytime I ran in to them. It had been about 6 months since I had seen them, I felt like I was in a place where I could wish them a happy birthday, have a small conversation and be okay. Even though I knew I had been a pushover I would never want them to think I stopped caring. I wished them a happy birthday. And they texted back “who is this?” Sure they could’ve lost my number switching phones over but I highly doubt it. It hurt insanely bad after how long and often i had been there for them, and realize none of my feelings reciprocated even the platonic ones. They had never cared about me as much as I cared about them."

I have a few friends who do engineering, and from what I’ve heard from them, you will absolutely hate it unless you have a very high interest in it. They all have a lot of interest in it, and being in the field after graduating, but the workload and intensity have them doubting it sometimes. You have to weigh the pros and the cons. Yeah, we all want high paying jobs. You would be able to pursue passions outside of your job, but at the cost of hating your job? Not worth it to me personally."
