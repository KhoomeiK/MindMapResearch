When I was able to work on a computer (I am 32 so some of my homework was allowed to by typed up, but none done online) I could get better grades, and my sentences and structure improved drastically because I wasn’t in pain from writing.

I looked normal, so nobody knew I was in pain when writing. It happened every day, so I didn’t even recognise it as pain. I thought everyone had cramps and their fingers slipped out.

If I had suddenly been able to work online my work could have improved massively. Everyone assumed I was lazy because I was intelligent and “just wouldn’t do the writing”...

I am *NOT* saying that’s what is going on here. I am *certain* a fair number of parents are doing work for their kids too X( but some students may genuinely vastly improve for a variety of reasons:
Comfortable environment (no bullies, soft clothes, comfortable chair, quiet, music they like, being able to sleep and work at their own pace etc.)
Doing work online (immediate hand in, can’t lose it, can’t forget where you put it, can’t lose your pen, can’t have a sibling or pet or abusive parent ruin it)
Typing (is easier than writing for some people, may be easier than verbal speech for some)
Having access to snacks and drinks around the clock for some students.
Some may feel like they miss you so much they will work harder.

I hope some of your students will be sending you good work for those reasons! <3"

I didn’t get a test, because my local hospital wasn’t able to get enough, and I managed to stay home mostly, but I had suspected Covid in mid March (started aprox March 16th).

I am 32 with various complex disabilities.

I am NOT a doctor or any other kind of healthcare person.

After several weeks of drowning in my own fluids at home the second set of Doxycycline seemed to clear it up. But then I developed liver damage, and then a kidney infection. Last week one of my pupils decided to dilate... I think I may have another UTI, and I am being treated for gastritis and may have lung tissue healing (I have a lot of chest pains but my peak flow and breathing are ok with my inhalers).

I hope you get some answers soon and your doctors take good care of you.

My husband had a mild cough for 4 days.

My eldest was a bit pale and had a fever for a few days and a cough.

My youngest who is quite severely asthmatic had a big asthma flare the week before she had any symptoms. We had to increase her inhalers to the maximum dosages and her eczema flared all on her face too. By the time her fever came out she was a bit better. Her cough lasted a bit longer than the lads. But she was fine within a week of fever.

I am still unwell.

I am hoping an antibody test will come out soon so we can check if it was c19 and not another nasty infection. But the symptoms fit well, and the doctors who treated me felt sure enough to put it in my medical notes.

I really hope you get some good news and they find a way to help you. Have you tried rolling on all of your sides (especially your tummy) at night? Or sitting up a bit with some extra pillows? It won’t fix anything but may make you more comfortable? I found laying on my tummy was the best. I even tried sleeping in my recliner chair but it didn’t help as much as laying on my tummy and rolling on each side a lot. But obviously follow medical advice if they have said something else!

Good luck!"

I have a bad headache as of yesterday, BUT I also have a cold that my family have all had (lasts about 1-3 days).

However the weirdest thing is my eyes:

Both eyes are responding weirdly to movement.

Flicker when I move them fast or when something else moves fast. Like a light effect. And if, for example I wave my hand quickly I can see my fingers for a few milliseconds where they are not.

A bit like when you are in a dark room with a strobe light but it only happens with movement, and it was worse last night.

I haven’t tried to get up today as I have a nasty headache still, but I have a feeling it will happen when I try and walk.

It feels like vertigo but in my eyeballs instead of my ears!

It may well just be normal variations in your skin, like freckles called cafe au lair marks then? I have literally half my torso and the top of one arm covered in a giant birth mark that looks like freckles :) and a tiny patch at the base of my neck that side too. Not usually an issue as long as the skin doesn’t show any changes and it doesn’t upset you?

Obviously if you are concerned do ask a dermatologist or general practitioner to check it for you. And if you want to keep an eye on them, taking a photo every 2-6 weeks or every 6-12 months can help identify any changes (short term for new marks or ones you think are changing, longer term for regular moles or birth marks).

You could pop some moisturiser on them or use some of the skin brightening creams (please only use safe formulations though! Don’t buy bleaches or online!!) that may even them out a little but they might not make any difference either."

However, I would like to point out that anxious people can get sick too.

I don’t think you are dying though.

Can you see a family doctor to get some general blood screens done? Including thyroid.

I think a 48hr heart monitor (the kind you can wear around your home and return)

And maybe a biopsy of your lumps? I’m not sure who would do that, dermatology? Or someone?

The chances are, that you are experiencing minor symptoms that are on the spectrum of ‘normal’ for humans, and your anxiety is making that feel horrific. But those 3 sets of tests will take a few days, and don’t have any major risks to you. If anything does show up, it can be sorted. If not, you should be reassured that you feel ok.

I agree with other comments to stop watching your heart rate. If it is stressing you out, don’t do it. You need to put yourself in emotional intensive care at home right now. Try and make your environment as calm and safe as possible: set up music if you like, or watch the same film on repeat if that helps. Wrap up in cozy PJs. Make your comfort foods and have tiny tiny portions.

If you aren’t on lockdown, you can enjoy some exercise in the sunshine too. Or maybe do some dancing or whatever at home. Looking after your mental health is a lot like taking care of a pet or a baby. Just keep being kind to your body and your brain.

If you have things that make you feel good, like reading trashy magazines, or fantasy novels or watching sports or bubble baths or putting face paint on or writing poetry or knitting or cooking or fixing cars or anything like that, then make that a priority right now if you can.

I really hope, whatever is up, you feel much better soon xxx"

I would definitely use this close call to think about how you want to plan for your future. You have lots of options. And even if pregnancy is avoided there are infections that you could catch while on hormonal birth control, so it is worth considering using condoms.

As I said further up, both of my (wonderful!) children were created while my now husband and I were using condoms, so while they are very important for infections, they are also not completely safe on their own.

Is 111 available in Scotland? I would call them for advice and streamline care.

You should still get medical attention. Most hospitals have separate entrances and everything.

Good luck xxx

If you haven’t already: first aid I was taught was: run under cool water for several minutes and then wrap in clean cling film. Helps reduce the pain and keep it clean on your way to get it sorted."
BSL,fplqx50,t1_fpkg2le,1588717764.0,Are you sure I am not going to offend anyone? I feel inappropriate as I have very sensitive ears. I just have a brain that is bad at processing sensory information.
BSL,fpkdhqc,t1_fpjz82c,1588692691.0,"Thank you!

Yeah, I know Makaton is different, but the experience taught me that I feel more comfortable signing than I do talking. I also know finger spelling and I know that *some* of the signs are based on simplified BSL. So it may be semi-useful, if I am lucky! But mostly it has inspired me to get myself motivated to learn.

I am worried about my shoulders dislocating during signs, I don’t have good mobility with my elbows away from my waist. It’s fine to do anything with my arms by my sides (well, I mean all my joints pop out, but my shoulders are more of a nuisance to pop back in than fingers and wrists).

I haven’t had chance to speak to my friend much yet, she was open to the idea when I mentioned it before :) but we haven’t been super communicative as they are enjoying a honeymoon period with their partner and I don’t want to ruin that special time before it naturally calms down for them :) we still talk frequently but not for as long so it tends to be less in depth, and more current health and life stuff :) but I will ask if she is interested in video chatting to learn sign together. Her partner may want to join in too which could be fun!

Thank you for all the advice! :)"
accessibility,fpjtfma,t3_g0bko1,1588680493.0,"The wording is a bit unpleasant to be honest.
“Autism families” that would be “families with an autistic person” and “child with autism” no, statistically autistic people prefer to be called “autistic people”.

Also this appears to be almost entirely directed at parents. Which is very useful for parents. But it would be more inclusive if it it was just worded: “for disabled people and their carers” which would make it feel less like we are an after thought as usual?

I hope you accept this as constructive criticism with the understanding that those small changes can make a resource friendly to us or feel like it is just for parents, and infantilising."

Gastroparesis and other gastrointestinal disorders which have caused undesired starvation over the years.

If you don’t meet your caloric intake you will lose your brain capacity. It happens slowly, it’s almost unnoticeable at first. Like you just forget keys a bit more or can’t remember that word or when your friend’s birthday was... then you find yourself unable to understand complex concepts anymore. Ok you must just be tired, or thirsty...

Eventually you feel like the whole world is very confusing. You just focus on what you need to do. Get up, don’t faint. Wash. Nibble enough food not to be told off. Sip some fluids. Feel awful. Nap. Etc.

The first thing I noticed 4 weeks in to my hospital stay, when I had failed to respond to nasojejunal feeding and was put on TPN (feeding directly in to a vein that goes in to the heart with special food bags) was suddenly I could think again.

My brain was working. Not perfectly, but enough to make sense of things again.

Recently I have been sick with suspected C19, liver issues and now I have a kidney infection. My brain once again feels like it is losing those functions. Not entirely, but on that slippery slope.

If you have appetite loss, you need to speak to a registered dietitian and a GP or Gastrointestinal doctor to figure out why. A batch of general blood tests and some simple adjustments to your diet could make all the difference. If you are petite, perhaps you only need to add 2-700 calories to reach your daily target. But please keep your body safe xxx"

(They/them pronouns please) I’m 32, 5’10, 95kg (overweight-obese but have been instructed to stay this size so next time I have a major sickness flare I have enough spare fat to keep me alive while I’m waiting to recover).

I am very sedentary now, but until a few weeks ago, I was walking at least 20 mins a day with my elbow crutches and playing with my kids. Not super active, but we don’t have a car, so I didn’t really stay still. Since being sick I have struggled to move and breathe, but I’m managing more movement when I can. Made it to the front and back gardens today.

I know I had vitamin D deficiency and I am prone to random liver enzymes. One will pop up high, usually bilirubin but sometimes another one, and then in a few weeks it will be normal again. They have diagnosed it as Gilbert’s. BUT don’t know why I get random other enzymes pop up high (3x normal levels) but back to normal. Liver and kidneys look normal on ultrasound. Gallbladder was taken out 4 years ago after a nasty infection full of stones. Have had swollen spleen in the past but it returns to normal again. Kidneys always have slightly low filtration rates on blood tests, but not bad considering long term medication for pain, nausea, antidepressants etc. And low fluids frequently. They do ok and are stable over the last few years. But I haven’t had a blood test since January.

Finally: I do have lots of chronic health issues, but usually manage ok. I think this nutritional stuff and fluids stuff is my biggest issue right now. I really want a tube fitted so I can not have to stress. But it’s an up hill battle because I can keep weight on with sugar. So they are just wanting me to wait it out..."

They are SO vital to these children. They are preventing major crime, saving children’s lives and helping them get out of poverty. They are putting themselves on the line when they need to report large dangerous families to social services to make a child safe, they are usually the ones up all night working hard to figure out how they can include every child in each lesson despite having huge variety in each class.

I have huge respect and love for teachers. And the change they can bring. Some of my teachers saved my life when I was a suicidal teen. And I wish I could find them and thank them. The next best thing is to thank more teachers who do amazing work. And support staff too.

So if you have been kind but firm, or listened to a student, or just smiled when they needed you to, then you too deserve to know how amazing that is. Thank you!!"
