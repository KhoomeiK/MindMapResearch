But what worked for me in the very first days was to treat and care for myself as if I had a cold. I watched  lots of nostalgic movies on the couch under a blanket and ate my favorite foods. I cried it out of my system a lot. I read and watched anything and everything on the topic. I tried to not spend so much time dwelling on what happened to me and instead started to plan what I wanted my life to look like and how I can take baby steps to try and get there. I also was so lucky to have someone who knew what I was going thru and we talked everyday so this sub is a great place to be. Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself! You are not at fault! What she did to you was cruel and abusive. You deserve so much better in this life we are given! I don‚Äôt know you but I love and care about you. I‚Äôm no contact with my nmom going on 6 years now and it gets easier and easier. My life now is better than my wildest dreams than I ever thought it could be. I‚Äôm not talking about money and homes.. I live now with happiness and I laugh again everyday. It gets so much better and I know it will happen for you. Sending that message for me was exactly what i needed to do for myself. It felt like it was a quick decision and I would constantly doubt myself. But in my mind in that moment I knew I needed to and I reminded myself constantly that I did it for a reason, I was suppose to do it. Even though my black sheep mind kept saying I was over exaggerating,  it wasn‚Äôt that bad, I hurt her feelings..etc. I just reminded myself that at that moment I knew it had to be done and it was the right decision. Anyways I‚Äôm just rambling now... take care of yourself. You are the most important person right now to love and care for. Be gentle with yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
