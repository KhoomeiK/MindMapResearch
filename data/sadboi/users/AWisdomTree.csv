ElectricScooters,fklt0bx,t1_fklnwgz,1584313935.0,"Ok. But all of these sprockets have massive holes in the center, much bigger than scooter axles"
ElectricScooters,fkln5z2,t1_fklkmz3,1584310297.0,"Right. But if the parts that hold the rear wheel on a kick scooter are meant for just that, how do I get a sprocket and a chain on there?"
ElectricScooters,fkljhm8,t1_fklgzh9,1584307708.0,I’m gonna use a chain
ElectricScooters,fkho8bl,t1_fkgc4oj,1584202859.0,Yeah I guess. Wouldn’t be as fun though. I found 200mm wheels with sprockets already on them (I think they’re meant for the e200) but maybe I could put that on the back of an ancheer scooter. And then there’s hub motors too. And this is gonna get pricey.
ElectricScooters,fkg21lu,t1_fkg11dl,1584148018.0,"No worries. I could still look at the hub motor. Those seem to have less power but I suppose that’s ok. I don’t really know about batteries. I had heard that two 24v lead acid ones would work, but I’m not sure. They’re expensive, I’m not sure what to do with those. Are you saying to use the frame of the e100? Or what? I’m confused as to the use of that. Thanks (you’ve been super helpful I appreciate it)"
