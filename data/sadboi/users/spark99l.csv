alcoholism,fq9frr7,t3_ghino3,1589196846.0,"Thank you friend for your kind words. 

Your husband will probably need to find the “gift of desperation” in order to have the desire to get sober. Unfortunately, it sounds like he’s not hit his bottom yet, and when he does then he will want to get sober. Some people have high bottoms- become fed up enough with drinking before they lose anything or face serious consequences in their lives. Some people have low bottoms, and I pray for you and your husband that’s not the case here. Unfortunately there’s nothing you can do to help your husband hit bottom- it’s a personal journey. 

Sending love your way friend!"

I'm engaged too and I just caught my fiance lying to me for the first time. I was really hurt and upset about it and kept bringing it up. But we discussed it and then I had to honestly ask myself if I trusted this man, and I do wholeheartedly, so I had to let it go and stop bringing it up.

As for your second point, I get it, that is me to a tee. Reaching out to a sponsor is NOT comfortable or easy, but you have to do it. Nothing about the 12 steps is meant to be comfortable.  When you get to a point that you are SO uncomfortable drinking and with how your life is then you will do the uncomfortable things because it will be better than going back to the dark place you were in before. Just force yourself to do it and it will get easier with practice."
