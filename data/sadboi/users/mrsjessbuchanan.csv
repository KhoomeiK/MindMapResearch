rtms,fie6pbh,t3_ev234p,1582375743.0,"I am a medicinal caregiver and I grow medical cannabis for a living, I am also a heavy daily consumer so this is 100% based on my personal opinion, but I would not have stopped smoking. 

What you’re describing as withdrawals are actually your body not receiving the cannabinoids it’s used to in order to combat your depression. We as humans have an endocannabinoid system already, and consuming marijuana is the most natural way to combat the chemical imbalances in our brains causing depression. The lack of pleasure you were experiencing was due to the THC molecule not working on your “happy” neurotransmitter, anandamide. 
(Same concept as your insomnia issue) 
You were giving your body an aid to fight it off, and adding TMS was the kick it needed to give you the results you experienced. Once you cut out a key part of your treatment and stopped TMS it’s possible that your body didn’t know how to react. 
There’s a lot of stigma and lack of research around this topic, a lot of psychiatrists will tell you that you shouldn’t have smoked at all before treatment but I believe that is simply not true. 

If you were a patient of mine, I would ween you back into marijuana use ASAP. Our bodies truly were made for this plant and it hurts me to see doctors so carelessly and purposely uneducated because it really does help.

Breaks my heart that you have to feel this way, but remember you know your body best and it will tell you when it’s unhappy. Best of luck to you in all your future quests for healing- you’re not alone."
bipolar,fi6cov9,t3_f6p5sj,1582188368.0,"Research a few hotlines that can assist you with fast tracking your approval or pointing you in a different direction. Also, I would look into free/sliding scale mental health clinics. 
A lot of OBGYN’s are more inclined to assist than people think because the nature of their job does fall back on their patients mental stability quite a bit. When I had to terminate my pregnancy I was overwhelmed with the resources my regular OBGYN and Planned Parenthood had available to help find psychiatric treatment. Can’t speak for all, but it is more common now.

I really hope this gets resolved for you soon, I pick myself apart constantly and rip myself to shreds when I’m simply just getting dressed in the morning or washing my face. When things are decent the thoughts are still there if I look in the mirror, but they don’t consume me like they usually do. I hate that anyone could ever feel this way. Best of luck to you, you’re stronger and more beautiful than you know."
bipolar,fi69s1i,t3_f6n0gp,1582184541.0,"I have both bipolar and severe depression as well. 

Just had my first TMS treatment yesterday after fighting with my insurance since last July. I would not leave them alone because I was running out of options, (the few depression medications I am able to take weren’t working + my bipolar meds made my depression worse) and they finally budged and covered it completely. 

Write letters and call to every relevant department you can find depending on the size, because they have the power right in front of them. I wanted to give up (and did at times) throughout the whole thing, because it really is so so so taxing begging a stranger behind a desk to help you feel like a human being. Especially when dealing with life, work, medical debt & everything else. But please don’t give up and let them win! Your long term mental health is far more important than a lazy employee not wanting to get up and push a very reasonable (and inexpensive, compared to ECT) request through to their boss. 
 
Even if nothing comes of this and it doesn’t help anything at all, I’ll always wonder if I tried everything I can and I know a lot of people feel that way too. I hope you find a way through this quickly, you’re not alone!"
bipolar,fi68oi1,t3_f6om90,1582183196.0,Same. Made it 3 days really thinking this time I could free fall without crashing and burning everything around me. Yet here we are.
BipolarReddit,fhiz3j4,t3_f3hpvb,1581634768.0,"I realized I had to quit drinking back in 2017 when I started dating someone new during a very long manic episode. 

When I drank around this time in my life I would compulsively talk to everyone I interacted with about absolutely anything, and I would get angry which is something I’d NEVER get while intoxicated. Sober I am a very private person I don’t divulge ANYTHING about myself and I’m overly polite to a fault. 
Once I started dating this guy I would apparently turn into the nastiest and most evil person to him while intoxicated. I have a high tolerance usually, and even when I black out I still have a good idea of what went on around me. I remember where I went, who I was with, how I got home and all that jazz. 

But one day I woke up and didn’t know what time it was or what day it was. My phone was dead and I was butt ass naked. I was terrified. I charged my phone and called my boyfriend and he told me the night before on our way home I screamed and begged for him to pull the car over so I could run into traffic and kill myself, and when he didn’t I tried to jump out of the car going 65 down the highway. The rest of the way home I told him how awful he was and how much I hated him and then he dropped me off and I went inside my apartment. He broke up with me on that phone call. 

It was like I had been drugged, I had no recollection of it whatsoever and that terrified me because it’s never happened to me in 8 years of drinking. 
I quit for 2 years, then picked it back up socially. When my doctor put me on Lamictal in July I had to stop again because it made me act irrationally. 

Hopefully there’s a balance out there that you can find that works for you. I hate to advocate for drinking because I grow medical cannabis for a living and would always advise others to lean in that direction- but I know how hard it is not being able to go out and get a beer with your friends without fear of risking your behavior getting out of control. Best of luck to you! You’re not alone."
BipolarReddit,fgvbhq4,t3_f04cs6,1581143387.0,"The one time I spoke up I was in a 20+ person training class for my job to update us on company procedures and policies that lasted 3 weeks. 
Our instructor was a very nasty, rude man and very belittling to my fellow coworkers when they asked questions. During certain simulations he would create a character called “The Bipolar Client,” or “Mr. Bipolar” and use this character to practice our technique when dealing with someone who is rude, can’t make up their mind, and then suddenly turned sweet at the end because we did a good job. 

About 4 days in after repeatedly hearing the words “here’s where Mr. Bipolar would fit in” and watching this man act out someone with no grip on reality or human decency (pretty sure it wasn’t acting) and label it with my disorder I had had more than enough. My coworkers had started to notice my huffs and puffs and how I would turn and face the other direction and I believe they gathered why I was upset. 

I finally yelled out in the middle of his lecture “can you PLEASE pick another name for this jackass?” 

The entire class stared back at me and I had one of those “oh god what did you do this is real” 
moments. 
His eyes were wide as hell, and he stammered “excuse me?” I had to stick with what I did, so I kept going. I am however like Michael Scott and hope I find the end of my sentence along the way, so I was scared. 

But, I said “I’m sorry, but I have bipolar disorder and I have walked out of this room every single day trying not to cry because of how ignorant you’re being right now. I usually don’t get upset but I can’t stand another day of you twisting a difficult, made up client into an illness that’s caused me to attempt suicide. Especially in front of all my coworkers who I respect.”

A lot of my coworkers clapped and gave me a few “hell yeah/you go girls” and he honestly didn’t say a word. I got up, gathered my things and walked out. 

I was halfway to the front door when I heard him yell my name, he walked up to me and sincerely apologized. I could see the emotion in his eyes for the first time. He told me how uneducated he was to mental illness, didn’t know anyone who suffered in any way and didn’t grow up in a household where it was taken seriously. That “crazy was just crazy” and it wasn’t a taboo subject to poke fun at. He then thanked me for opening his eyes to the severity of bipolar disorder and promised to do better if I sat back down. 

Sometimes it’s better to say things in the right environment, you just might make the world a more understanding place."
BipolarReddit,fgv9oqu,t3_f0ghn5,1581141559.0,"Currently going through this as we speak. My Lamictal dosage was at 250mg and I was instructed to stop taking it immediately without weening myself off. I usually go to bed around 3am and wake up at 7:30am for work with a fair amount of energy. 
Since I’ve been off and began my new medication I’ve been falling asleep around 9pm after taking a nap when I get home and can’t keep my eyes open at work whatsoever. 

I’m on a high dosage of Vyvanse as well which always kept my energy up throughout the day, making it impossible to relax as soon as I got home which I liked. Now I fall asleep while on my Vyvanse the second I come home from work. Never happened to me before.

Hope you get this resolved soon, I really do! I completely empathize with your situation and you’re definitely not alone. Kinda comforting being on the same medication regimen as someone else for once, gotta say."
BipolarReddit,fgusdfy,t1_fgum9v0,1581128333.0,"I just want to say before anything else that this instantly brought me to tears, you’ve described so many recent moments of my life that have led me to realize I no longer feel what I know is there to be felt. Nothing is significant, it’s all happening before me yet it doesn’t touch me or connect with me. I notice, and that’s it. If I’m present enough to even care to notice, that is. It’s muted, dull, lifeless and disheartening and all I want is out. 

Thank you for sharing this with me, minute by minute I want to give up more and more. Hearing your story of strength to keep fighting really did give me a boost of hope, and it brings me so much joy to hear that you’ve found a treatment plan that lets you lead a fulfilling life. You have no idea. I couldn’t be more thrilled to hear success stories involving medication. Thank you once again for taking the time out of your day to share this with me."
BipolarReddit,fguh33x,t1_fgtboyy,1581120637.0,"No, you’re absolutely right! 
I’ve become so angry, cynical and suicidal that it’s so hard to appreciate anything around me. There’s that little voice inside that tells me to appreciate the little things again like I used to, I just need to start forcing myself so I can get into the habit again. 

Thank you so much for sharing that with me, I genuinely appreciate it. You must be in Washington?! I absolutely love crows, what an amazing thing to witness. Thank you again- best of luck to you and all you wish to achieve on your journey."

It’s very disheartening, but I assume that’s the only thing that can be done? 

I’m so, so sorry to hear about your mania and the results that followed. It’s beyond challenging trying to wiggle your way through this new world of treatment- hate hearing that anyone feels the way I do. I hope you have a great doctor that’s willing to listen to you & come up with a treatment plan that helps you get that creative spark back. Best of luck to you, always. You’re not alone."

BipolarReddit,fgsl4ex,t1_fgsj9eo,1581087031.0,"Happiness is defined by each of us individually, to  carelessly call someone else’s version of happiness, “manic” is pure ignorance and honestly extremely offensive to me. I have not given you any context into what played into those emotions at that time and it is not your job to interpret it. Also, I have biploar with dysphoric mania- so I don’t have happy manic episodes.
Don’t diminish the one thing in this world that’s ever made me feel something, that is not your place. I was simply asking if anyone else had felt that way.

BipolarReddit,fgrmmjp,t3_f03r2h,1581050831.0,"I was unstable as long as I can remember. I tried killing myself at age 14 for the first time. In and out of mental hospitals, psych wards, numerous rehabs and seeing endless psychiatrists and therapists my whole life. No one could help me. I was diagnosed as bipolar, borderline personality, manic depressive, schizophrenic- honestly everything you can think of, and I was medicated accordingly. 
I was a heavy opiate user as young as 15 years old and continued into my early 20’s. 
By the time I was 25 I had been sexually assaulted and raped multiple times, been in countless physically abusive relationships and had tried to take my life five times. 
Finally after one last attempt I was sent to a behavioral rehab in Arizona where I was handled by the most caring team of doctors I had ever encountered. I felt respected, loved and heard for the first time in my life. The available mental health treatment centers on the east coast where I grew up were awful & negligent yet this was the complete opposite. 

I was properly diagnosed for the first time in my life by the most phenomenal doctor and human I have ever had the pleasure to know. I’ll never forget him as long as I live. I turned out to have bipolar with dysphoric mania- one of the rarest forms of bipolar. 
I experience my mania alongside my depressive spells which in turn put me at a higher risk of suicide and more severe destruction. There are no high or happy parts of my bipolar. I am angry, suicidal, depressed, lethargic and chaotic all at once every single day. I don’t know who I am from one second to the next. 

He put me on Lamictal and I felt so confident that I would be able to be my best self. I felt like I was finally understood & that I wasn’t alone. For the first time in my life I felt hope. 

Fast forward 9 months later to now, I unfortunately feel worse than I ever have. My medicine stopped working, my new psychiatrist has been trying every mood stabilizer/antipsychotic cocktail he can think of and just recently told me from a DNA test that my body is resistant to 80% of biploar medicines. I’m in the process of getting my insurance to approve me for TMS sessions, so hopefully this works. This is my final shot before I really do lose all hope. I have lost all of my lifelong friendships, my partner can’t take anymore of my behavior and my family lives 3,000 miles away. I’m all alone and sometimes I wish I wasn’t diagnosed at all."
