schizophrenia,fqguwub,t1_fqgtoih,1589357973.0,"In schizophrenia there exist what are known as ""positive"" and ""negative"" symptoms.
The labels do not refer to degree of pleasantness. 
Positive symptoms are the things ""added"" by the disease (psychotic symptoms), such as hallucinations, delusions, and thought/speech disorder.


Negative symptoms encompass the behaviors lost/taken away by the illness (decrease in ordinary function).
 These include anhedonia (difficulty experiencing pleasure), avolition (decrease in motivation), trouble with concentration, fatigue, ""brain fog"", apathy or decreased interest in activities, a blunted affect, social withdrawal, etc.
A lot of us find that medication can actually worsen the negative symptoms. But it varies.


I very recently switched to Latuda from my last medication, Vraylar 4.5.
The starting dose for Latuda is generally 40mg. I expect to titrate up soon. 


I hope this helps!



(EDIT to add that many people actually take multiple antipsychotics, and much heavier doses than me. I am very sensitive to the physical side effects of medication, and have difficulty tolerating them past a certain level.)"
schizophrenia,fqgsmrg,t3_gir7g2,1589355795.0,"Clozapine is typically a last resort drug. While it is known for its effectiveness relative to other antipsychotics, it requires frequent white blood cell monitoring. With some exceptions, Clozapine would ordinarily not be administered until many other antipsychotics had been exhausted as options.
So whether this drug is a viable write-in depends on the character.


Have the issues with psychosis been long standing? Was he previously considered to be treatment resistant? 



As for your questions regarding breakthrough symptoms, these can and do occur for many of us living with the condition. While for some people, antipsychotics can completely eliminate psychotic symptoms, for others they are either ineffective entirely, or only to an extent. Sometimes, you go through a period of feeling ""cured"", only for the thing to rear its head a time again. This is often when dosage is upped.



For me, antipsychotics lessen the severity of hallucinations but definitely do not cancel them out entirely. I am significantly less delusional on medication, but sometimes I find myself slipping back into a bad thinking pattern (usually realizing after the fact). Breakthrough symptoms are often, but not always, triggered by external stressors.



So yes, you can realistically portray a character who is in treatment, but for whom medication does not entirely eliminate psychotic symptoms. 



Another consideration to make, going forward with the story, is the presence of the ""negative symptoms"" of schizophrenia. I advise you do some reading on this, as it is the lesser-known side to the condition, and is currently much less successfully treated by medication.



Best of luck with your script."

This particular individual was hellbent on convincing me that I have been lied to and poisoned by my doctors, and should abandon all medication in a hurry. She even went so far as to claim that ""the general course of psychosis is recovery without intervention"", which is an insane belief.


I tried to explain to her the true severity of a psychotic break, the potential for brain damage when it is allowed to carry on for prolonged periods without medical intervention, the quality of life restored to so many of us thanks to modern medicine, etc.


No matter what I said, she only grew increasingly insistent that I was willfully choosing to ignore her, and that antipsychotics should never be administered, even in the worst of cases. She discounted the studies I linked her to on the basis of ""that research is paid for by pharmaceutical companies"".

Likewise, there is a certain duality to each aspect of life. Many things I consider to be both good and bad.

I have decided to keep living for these instances - even when it feels like waiting on Halley's Comet, or something.

I hope that you, too, can find a semblance of peace, somewhere -- even if it seems to be ephemeral. To experience the universe is a good thing, I think, in spite of having to experience it in this way.

I am sorry if this is unhelpful. Please do disregard it if so - I know that my truth is mine alone. And if it proves to be little more than some washed up ramblings in the world of another, than that is the truth of it as well.
Mainly, I just want to extend a bit of love, and wholehearted wishes for your wellbeing."

schizophrenia,ew05y16,t3_cm5r81,1564976784.0,"I have difficulty driving at night, as well.
Both day and night I think objects lying in the road are animals, and hit the brakes/swerve to avoid ""harming"" twigs and branches. Hah.
At night I have a lot of trouble telling where objects/paths end and begin (the edges of streets, the outline of a turn, etc). My vision is fine, it is a perceptual issue.
I don't really feel afraid driving, as you described (it is more a technical trouble) -- but I do when stopping at stores by night. I am often overcome with a bad feeling. Sinister music will play when I step out of the car, almost on cue."

illnessfakers,evroz84,t3_ckwbcx,1564714235.0,"With some of the subjects here, I do feel there is some thread of truth woven beneath the lies. Some underlying illness which is, to a degree, valid -- but came to serve as the rather unfortunate launching point to a series of fabricated/exaggerated conditions.
 (In which the original issue could have been recovered from, or at least stabilized/managed such that leading a normal life would be very much within reach - but the subjects seem to resent the end of any such ""journey"", and there begins the cycle, not unlike addiction.)

With Ren, I do not see this.
From the information provided here and on her page, I cannot find evidence to support her having any real condition worth noting, at all. Nothing that would warrant anything more than a casual mention. Absolutely no material at all from which to construct one's entire identity.
She stands out from other subjects in this way, I think.
I can see how some of the others have casual observers fooled. If I had not encountered this page, or the concept of factitious disorder itself, I think that I might have scrolled past some of these people and truly believed them.
But Ren? 
I don't see how she could fool anyone at all, let alone  a person working in the healthcare field.
Everything about her presentation is a very clear grab for attention. The desperation is not concealed in the slightest.
I'm not sure how to properly address the theatrics at play here. She does a very poor job of selling it."

schizophrenia,euznof6,t3_chz0an,1564123095.0,"According to DSM-5, Criterion A for schizophrenia must be met, with the added presence of a mood disorder (periods of mania and/or depression). Mood disturbances must be observable throughout the majority of the course of the illness. Psychotic symptoms must remain present outside of these major mood episodes, else the diagnosis would lean toward mood disorder with psychotic features.
(In mood disorder with psychotic features, the mood disturbance is the dominant element.)
Severity of illness varies widely, as with schizophrenia. Would be difficult to make a blanket statement concerning average prognosis."

cornsnakes,eureg2o,t3_cha4i3,1563993066.0,"I, too, bought the tree from hell.
Really, the only thing to do about it is wait.
Most likely, she is not stuck -- simply hiding.
I had to wait nearly a week for mine to emerge from the hollow branch. When he did, I threw that shit out right away.
A tip for encouraging her out-- throw a towel over the enclosure. Sometimes it calms them down enough to encourage out from hiding.
If she is due for a shed soon, that could be part of the reasoning for hiding up there, as well -- when mine shed, he emerged.
Best of luck to you!

Edit - I believe this is a slightly different tree than the one mine got stuck in. But very similar, same concept."
