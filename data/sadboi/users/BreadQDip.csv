Horrormovieclub,f8qecsm,t3_e1ke0t,1574716379.0,"Honestly, I felt like the movie was kind of dull. Rabbit and Bob (the killer) were pretty boring characters with little personality. I suppose if I was locked up my whole life my personality wouldn‚Äôt be the best either, but it made the movie excruciating. Rabbit just looked like a deer in the headlights throughout the whole movie.  I didn‚Äôt like the pseduo-psychoanalytic flashbacks where they tried to explain Bob‚Äôs behavior because of abuse in his life. I felt like the movie was pretty shallow and never  really goes any deeper. I‚Äôm sure there is a right way to do flashbacks, but that wasn‚Äôt it.  The women Bob captures just whimper, beg for their lives, and bleed. Not much else. Little variety. 

When you read the description it is suppose to be about his struggle with becoming like Bob, but there never was much of a struggle. He didn‚Äôt ever engage in the behavior of Bob or have an urge to. It felt like it was more about Bob not finding out that he wasn‚Äôt like him. It would have been nice if there was some sort of internal struggle with it and he engaged more in Bob‚Äôs behavior throughout the movie. 

I guess  if the ending was supposed to mean that he was following Bob‚Äôs footsteps and would become a killer, there was nothing leading up to it that would make you think that. It would have given rabbit‚Äôs character more dimensions if there was. 

I also just didn‚Äôt like how the ending came out of nowhere. 

Also there was never a moment where bob was threatening to get caught by police or anything, except that one weak scene where he writes help on the side of the car. When Rabbit kills Bob, it was like a nothing scene. Not very dramatic or drawn out. It just happened."
