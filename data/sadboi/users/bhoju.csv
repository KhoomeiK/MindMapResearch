AskReddit,ex2rqxt,t1_ex0vddq,1565974229.0,"I can completely relate to this, but my company hasn't changed a bit since I joined last year. Every quarterly party is just about drinking and food gets so little preference over that, it pisses me off. 
For all of our monthly dinners, we go to buffets and as soon as we reach there, one of my colleagues goes straight to the manager there and try to convince them to add one beer per head to our package. And mostly he gets it. 
Whenever I talk to a friend of mine about this, I jokingly  say, ""this is what happen when it's an all male leadership."" :p"

Recently, it has started affecting my work which never happened before. So, going to see a counselor next week and will try your method as well."

AskReddit,es71ix5,t3_c69dgo,1561661944.0,"At times, I start thinking about situations that happened in the past (and how I could have dealt it better) or something that may happen in the future. Lately, I am aware of it whenever this happens, so I tell myself, ""this is out of your control, don't worry about it"". It does help, but I still have such thoughts from time to time, although the frequency has come down. 
Idk these would classify as intrusive thoughts, but they used to affect me very much in the past."

offmychest,es3iz0p,t3_c5jzhy,1561563630.0,"I once took my friend to a place where I had never seen a girl coming to eat (although the cashier was a woman and they served really good meat, so I wanted her to taste that). It was a small place and usually quite crowded. We had to share our table with two guys. One of these guys, sitting next to my friend, kept looking at my friend and as soon as I noticed this, I kept looking into this guy's eyes. But he kept doing it and out eyes met several times and everytime, at that moment, he had the look of being caught, but he did not stop even after his food arrived. 

I used do this from time to time when I knew that someone is checking out a girl."

AskReddit,es2n6l2,t3_c56tib,1561530749.0,"I am currently working as a data analyst, with a master's degree in civil engineering. So, I have skills related to research and analytics. Recently, I have applied for a master's in psychology, as I aim to become a clinical psychologist. I have told my family about this, but they do not know much about the course or my long term goal. I want to move back to my hometown, where there are no analytics or research related jobs, but if I become a psychologist, I can find a good job in my hometown or even start my own practice. This is going to take some time, but I think it's going to worth it, as I get to do something I want, plus I would get to live with my family."
