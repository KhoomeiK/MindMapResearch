legaladvice,fpwmox9,t1_fpwl3ql,1588966159.0,Not triggering a contact allergy by forcing direct contact is a reasonable accommodation. Not sure whats so hard to understand about that but you’ve already decided that youre right and thats fine. The restaurants insurance companies say different and their opinion is a bit more valuable.
legaladvice,fpwl0yt,t1_fpwktw1,1588965318.0,So not forcing someone to touch their allergen when they normally work cashier isn’t a reasonable accommodation? Doesnt sound likely. Also he already has been promised damages from the companies insurance due to it so yeah it is. It’s not my opinion as much as it is the literal fact that he’s getting reparations for it.
legaladvice,fpwkj5u,t1_fpwk7ho,1588965065.0,Posted last night before meeting with upper management in case anyone had any advice to arm ourselves with. And i don’t know about yall but I’d (and the law) say that not making someone work directly with their allergen is reasonable accommodations. the peanut factory analogy doesn’t work because people are allergic to peanut being in the air as it releases dust.

Its not based on the precepts that anyone is inferior or superior only oN the belief that you shouldn’t let slurs that dont belong to your racial/etunic group fly wildly. And the word wasn’t used historically to dehumanize other races. And when it was used to insult other races it was because it was comparing other ethnicities and races (irish, arab) to black people."
TumblrInAction,fpkkmn5,t1_fpkkamw,1588696370.0,Those other races weren’t dehumanized using it. And its really not racism because the world isnt black and white and one dimensional and context matters in the world. And no one is comparing a white kid who says the nword to hitler.
TumblrInAction,fpkjt6e,t1_fpkj8ab,1588695956.0,Saying that someone shouldn’t use a slur that another race is called is not racism. Also theyre allowed to do it. They are also allowed to deal with the social consequences. And if it is and thats the only racism that you ever face then that sounds like a great life. And like I said because it’s distasteful to say a slur that has never been applied to you. No one’s stopping you from saying all the nwords you want but that doesn’t mean that people can’t choose to stop associating with you for using a slur.
TumblrInAction,fpkgs10,t1_fpkgj06,1588694408.0,"Its not an insult for just saying the word but like I said earlier due to the historical context of the word (which yes, does matter because we do not live in a black and white world with no depth) is distasteful and if society decides that they don’t want anything to do with that person it’s only on them because this isn’t a new issue and theyll have no one to blame but themselves for saying a word they know they probably shouldnt."
TumblrInAction,fpkg7hl,t1_fpkftp1,1588694113.0,"Its not an insult. Look up what adlib means. Some people are raised where its the equivalent of saying dude. So it would be saying “dude, youre an idiot”. Which is yes an insult but an insult independent of the adlib put in front of it unless they’re specifically saying the nword with the intonation that the nword is the insult. Which is wouldn’t be because the insult is calling them an idiot. And its not no reason at all. It’s a symptom of the fact that language and dialect are passed down through generations and that speaking in such a way is often part of AAVE."
TumblrInAction,fpkf6p3,t1_fpketnl,1588693576.0,Saying the nword as an adlib in conversation is different than using it as an insult which I have rarely ever heard it said from a black person as an insult and I’ve lived in a 50/50 black white city for many years. And generally I agree w/ that sentiment. Doesn’t mean that its not worse coming from other people than it is black people. (Sorry for being American centric lmao too many Americans always assume that the person youre talking to is but you got the point I assume). Its kinda the same concept as you can call yourself ugly all day but its pretty rude for someone else to call you ugly.
TumblrInAction,fpkel2t,t1_fpkeb9x,1588693264.0,Hmmm black people never used the word to oppress and humiliate each other. Can’t say the same abt white people throughout history. If you can’t see why saying the nword when your ancestors used it to dehumanize people and up to like 40 years ago used it in addition to other words to compare ethnicities they didn’t like to black people is distasteful then I’m about to enter a bad faith argument.

White pride historically has been used to demean other races and that is the different. If a white person said irish pride its different because that doesn’t have a connotation of supremacy. Black people in western countries are all united by the common struggle of overturning historically racist practices, laws, and attitudes. White people in American aren’t united by anything except whiteness and that its always been seen as a desirable trait. So thats the difference bwtwen black pride, white pride, and pride in one’s nationality."

Even by 3rd cousins you’d be completely unrelated as far as genetics go you’d only share a minimum percentage of DNA - little to no chance of genetic deformities because of incest (because its not at this point). If that makes sense to you.
