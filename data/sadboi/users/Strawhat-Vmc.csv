If he has a hobby he does alone where his environment has an opening for kidnapping i would tail his hobby, when he is alone and unsuspecting i would kidnap him, have a gun ready either buy cuffs or rope i would cuff both arms and legs short cloth and duck tape. First navigate a wooded area or good amount of desert. Find a place far far far away where someone would have to really journey to hear you. Use coordinates to find the place if you need to find it again for whatever reason, once there you can either take your time to kill this person or torture. Depending on how long you want the death to be prolonged. I would like it to be long but within reason as you wouldnt want to be discovered. First lay the victim on the ground still bound if in a wooded area bind his arms and legs to nearby trees use tight knots and strong rope, or straps if you have them. if able have him suspended by air. If you want to torture while alive cut up his flesh wherever pleasing, maybe dig into the wounds and add fluids that would burn and linger. Cut off some fingers/toes and tongue feed it to the victim, gouge the eyes cut of the ears nipples feed it to him. Cut a donut of flesh from the belly and set a burning piece of metal atop the fresh wound leave for the victim to suffer set a fire beneath the victim to force continued suffering and for the metal atop the belly to heat and simmer on the burning body. Stop the fire whenever victim dies. Before disposing the body, first cut holes in feet and neck where all the blood of the body can be drained. Then cut up the body by sections feet severed, knees to feet, knee to thigh, torso to shoulder to elbow to hands and kneck. You can either choose the site as the location for the remains of the corpse but should already have a hole dug for the grave. Or take the pieces and throw them away in a different location, or be rid of them at some ocean now you must be wary on time and the scent of the body. You can rent a boat and go far into the ocean find a current that leads inward to sea. Or simply set each section on fire until complete rubbish but it would take serious heat to destroy the bone so you would need some sort of furnace and plenty of fuel. The organs would have fluid or air (kidneys) puncture all wounds and drain all blood. If you throw the corpse in the ocean use dark trash bags and throw rocks or whatever makes it sink quickest, and any other tool associated with the job including any info regarding you. Try and use fake ids and cash for all buys leading to the deed. This is just an idea not an action, Disclaimer i would never act on this. Just sharing my thoughts on revenge. I respect the law and would not murder anyone. This is a fictional senario that may or may not ever happen. I would not act this out if given the opportunity.
