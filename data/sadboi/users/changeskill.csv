indie_rock,f2yrosk,t1_f2yrmxg,1570496826.0,"and of course, the cover art is one of a kind."
indie_rock,f2yrmxg,t3_deec1m,1570496791.0,"loved it! i always adore guitar driven songs, and your choice of sound are great. really like the ""rawness"". what pedals did u use in this EP?"
indie_rock,f2yr9fq,t3_dec77r,1570496524.0,Ah those guitars so creamy! And reminds me of MBV's Glide EP. Good stuff.
indieheads,f2wqz1q,t3_deijoj,1570469115.0,"The album has somewhat destructive energy (in a good way) which i really like. ZCS' vocals sounded really pure, much better than Is The Is Are's vocals, and in a way distinctive and cannot be compared to Oshin. Riffs sounded unique, but something is missing in my opinion, Oshin's riffs still better. But i'm a fan of the minimalistic approach to the reverb and the tremolo shoegazy guitar atmosphere. I wish there were more post-punk-esque tracks like Skin Game, Blankenship, and The Spark, but i think it's just my preference. It's a really good record overall."
IndieMusicFeedback,f2rkmy8,t3_dbw5fw,1570373997.0,thank you for your commentary mate. truly appreciated!

IndieMusicFeedback,f24ks94,t1_f24hopk,1569954561.0,"wow didn't expect this respond, but thank you! appreciate it."
IndieMusicFeedback,f24cpmy,t3_dbltlr,1569949180.0,yeah i think this track needs more bass. groovy bass! overall nice mix and good melody too.  the vocals sounds pleasant too. well done mate!
IndieMusicFeedback,f24cg7w,t3_dbbjsw,1569949025.0,REALLY HOOK ME SINCE THE START OF THE SONG! This is what alternative rock sounds like! Your voice is so great. Really dig this. The mixing is really good for ears too! Well done mate! Subscribed!
IndieMusicFeedback,f24c8a7,t3_dbnm4b,1569948894.0,"really nice artistic choice with the ambience, slow beat, and spoken words. the way it sounds so digital is pretty nice too. maybe need to fill the empty spaces with melody or something. good job!"
IndieMusicFeedback,f249bin,t3_dbj2ll,1569947271.0,"wow nice idea to fuse those vibes. i think the rhythm has a pretty nice sound. but i think you should work more on the melody to make it sounds distinct! (the pedals maybe) and i think there is some change in the balancing between rhythm and melody in the end (idk maybe u did in on purpose haha). and i'm more of a lyrical guy, but those are preferences. but this sure is funky. well done mate!"
IndieMusicFeedback,f248ewq,t3_dboncg,1569946772.0,"i really like the simplicity of the drum beat. and i think the voice layering is pretty nicely done too. it's both atmospheric and dancy too, well done mate!"
IndieMusicFeedback,f247wwm,t3_dbq9gj,1569946518.0,"wow i think it's pretty unique track. simple thing like the ""HAHA!!!"" part can hook people to your music! the rhythm sounds both complex and simple. really good job man. and happy birthday too!"
unpopularopinion,ex37vzr,t3_cram3u,1565981424.0,i think that's pretty popular
NameThatSong,eukc4e4,t1_eukaesf,1563886291.0,"ah got it you talked about the vii chords! i think it was my fault, what i meant was not the vii. the progressions im looking for is updated. i want songs with similar progressions like post malone's better now. genre probably anything but edm or kpop. songs with lyrics preferable. thank you for your explanation truly appreciate it!"
NameThatSong,euk6fvb,t1_eujnzxq,1563883972.0,my bad! thank you for the correction. yes but i think it sounds intense and nice for core of the song
IndieMusicFeedback,euil4t7,t3_cghf89,1563850126.0,i really like the chords and the guitar sound! it feels soft and raw in a way. the vocals are pretty modernish in a good way. nice work mate. maybe a more improvised bassline will give more groove and fills the gap. good thing anyway!
Anxiety,euik9xp,t3_cgmsto,1563849591.0,"whenever i feel anxious about starting a new thing, i always think about the reason why i decided to start the thing at the first place. i think by that im getting a sense of purpose, and that relaxes my mind a little. maybe you can try it too. also listen to your fav music maybe.. you can get through this my friend!"
IndieMusicFeedback,euii0vz,t3_cgkwub,1563848201.0,interesting thing! it's both laidback and i think a good song for a trip. maybe more spacy or trippy artwork will be a nice addition!
IndieMusicFeedback,euih8qg,t3_cgmh9o,1563847723.0,"it feels sleepy, laidback"
