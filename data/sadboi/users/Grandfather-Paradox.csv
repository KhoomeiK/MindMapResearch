PresidentialRaceMemes,fi4q2ax,t1_fi4pogy,1582146184.0,"Again, she may very well come in second in California and Nevada, but if she's below 15%, she gets zero delegates. I used to like Warren very much before she pivoted on M4A and started attacking Bernie without provocation. I don't hate her and would vote for her in the general. ""Who she is and what she stands for"" cannot make her a top tier candidate on their own, though."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fi4n1xe,t1_fi4lxx7,1582144488.0,"Nobody is denying that Warren is currently third in the delegate count, and she's in 4th place in the WaPo/ABC 2/14-17 poll. I guess by some metric, that's the ""top tier"", but what we're looking at is long-term trends and delegate math. Her numbers consistently drop, and she just simply doesn't have a path to the nomination in terms of the delegates she can realistically get. She has a good chance of getting zero delegates in California due to being below 15% viability. It's virtually impossible to recover from that and the other Super Tuesday losses she'll likely suffer. If some miraculous reversal happens, I'll eat my words, but that just doesn't seem possible."

While it was undoubtedly racist, the whole point of it was that it was patently obvious to everyone with half a brain cell that Warren was lying about being a Native American."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fi4f43a,t1_fi4ehv7,1582139920.0,"I actually tend to think it's more complicated than that, although that will certainly be the effect. Warren and her supporters may actually be delusional enough to think that she still has a chance. If we've learned anything from her campaign, it's that Warren has zero political instincts. She and her advisors destroyed a promising campaign the moment they pivoted on M4A. But even before that, we should have known she had no clue what she was doing when she did that idiotic DNA test that basically proves that she is NOT a Native American. Anyone with halfway decent advisors and political instincts would have known 1) not to take the DNA test to begin with, and 2) not to publish the results when they disprove what you're claiming. More to the point, maybe try not lying about being a Native American your entire life? But anyways, the point of this is that it's hard to even know what Warren's actual campaign goals are because she and her team are fucking terrible at achieving them."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fi4d2fe,t1_fi4cpt0,1582138732.0,And she made the fatal mistake of hiring a bunch of ex-Hillary staffers. I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would want to hire people from a campaign so incompetent and soulless that they lost to Donald fucking Trump.

This kind of reeks of internalized homophobia/femmephobia. I get that it's your body and you're entitled to do whatever you want with it, but this honestly exists on the same spectrum as conversion therapy. If you worry so much about changing characteristics about yourself as fundamental as your voice, you're in for a world of self-loathing and heartache. Anyone who's telling you that you're going to be able to make any significant alterations to your vocal style are kidding themselves and you. This is in no way analogous to a trans man changing his voice with hormones. In that case, the pitch is what's being changed, not the actual speaking style. Presumably you have already gone through male puberty and thus have a deeper pitch to your voice but a feminine vocal style. Please, take the time to reflect on why you even want to do this."

leaves,esyvok0,t3_c975ff,1562350502.0,"I relate to this *so* much. Since withdrawal seems to have made me depressed (I'm on day 7), I've been so stressed out about the political environment in the US, particularly concerning climate change and the future of the world as we know it. I haven't figured out how to grapple with it yet. I know that it's particularly bad because I'm depressed right now, and depression colors everything with a layer of pessimism, but obviously these feelings don't just come out of nowhere and then disappear. Our current political environment is truly nothing short of a dystopian nightmare. Maybe weed masks some of that and makes it tolerable. But regardless, we need to find healthier ways to cope with it. I've heard meditation can help with this sort of thing, although I've yet to will myself to do this regularly. Wishing you luck. Hopefully it helps to know there are others out there who feel just like you do."

SandersForPresident,esd9x9i,t1_esd6kyt,1561851254.0,"I agree that this bothered me at the recent debate, but the real issue is that it's just not possible to articulate anything but very superficial policy in 30 seconds. For example, when they asked him if taxes on the middle class would go up under Medicare-for-all (or his policies in general), he was being evasive in giving an answer. He can't really just say ""yes"" because he won't have time to properly explain how, while taxes on the middle class *would* rise under his MFA plan, they'd end up paying less overall due to not paying for private insurance anymore and would receive much better coverage. He did end up saying something to this effect, but it's literally impossible to hash out important details of his MFA bill, which is 96 pages long, in 30 seconds. Not to mention that the funding bill is separate, so it would take even longer. 

All in all, televised debates are a total sham. They aren't debates in any meaningful sense; they're performances, and Bernie is not a performer. Kamala Harris did well in my opinion because, as a prosecutor, her career is built largely on performance before an audience (a judge or jury). Nonetheless, I agree that he could have done a better job, but the odds are stacked against anyone with complex policy (Warren included) and favor people like Mayor Pete with zero substance and nice-sounding sentiments."

Dany may have actually saved many people in the long term, as she contends. But no, we're not allowed to even entertain this view. Tyrion would have had her giving Cersei a boat and a pile of gold, letting her escape to Essos, and then be slaughtered by the still intact Lannister army. We have to view Dany as a queen gone mad with power, and that's that. Dany was the greatest liberator the world has ever seen, and Jon Snow is a queenslayer."
