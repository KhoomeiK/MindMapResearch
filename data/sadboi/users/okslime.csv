PanicAttack,foxbz1u,t3_g9ywpa,1588139467.0,gonna let you in on something.. this is how my anxiety and panic attacks started I ended up in the ER thinking I was gonna die because of chest pains I thought I was going to have a heart attack at 3AM scared the living hell outta my mom just to be told I’m okay and healthy that it was just Anxiety. Weeks later I visited the hospital again to get multiple XRAYS to make sure it wasn’t heart failure I felt pain but the minds a weird thing it makes you believe pain that’s not there. I promise you you’re okay this lead me down a spiral of negative thinking I was already depressed before all of those beliefs that my heart was gonna fail so make sure if that is what’s affecting you. It went from my chest to brain tumor to Feeling like I’m gonna pass out every time I’m in public took a lot of realizing and convincing to tell myself I’m okay. I still get anxious and have some panic attacks about my health it sucks but life must move on 🙏🏼 best of luck to you same age as well 18
