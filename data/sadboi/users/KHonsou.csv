Its a very busy train-station that the store is next to, but I'm glad Nando's feels the need to tell some people (who have flu-like symptoms) that they still need to come in. 

Thanks Nando's. 

The best thing is, the person who had to go in was isolated for 2 weeks with a boyfriend who has lung issues. He is off work for a month now. At least I'll know if he does get Corona, I could probably trace it back to the Nando's in question."

I was thinking about that with Gamestops decision to keep going and ignore the guidelines. Once said and done, I think a lot of places (and people) will get sued into the ground."

Maybe lessons will be learnt in the coming years, but the reality at the moment is how sensitive US politics is to out-side interference.

A weakened US, Russia with its new Tsar, and China coming out of this all good to be the new major super-power by far and already showing off with its military exercises closer than ever before towards Taiwan. 

The internet is actually a source of hope, since the people underneath the turmoil are always communicating, and communication is the key weakness to totalitarian rule."

pcgaming,fkugfuq,t1_fktm5ck,1584548962.0,"I know someone who wanted to play this, went infiltrator and just ran in a direction on the map complaining of nothing to see.

Then once they figured out how to teleport and see where the fighting is, they quit because being in a front-line in a corridor as a sniper doesn't last long. 

I think they sell it as a awesome FPS (which it is for the most part), but not as a MMO, which it is. Its not going to be for everyone, but for the people who click with it, its insanely good."
