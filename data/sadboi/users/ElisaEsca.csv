socialskills,fqzenk2,t3_gllosj,1589765772.0,"It changes a lot in college and even more so after. The things that are important now usually won’t be as important in the future.  I’ve always been socially awkward, still am.  The difference js now it doesn’t bother me. The good thing is when u get to that sweet spot when your crowd is good for you. It can take a while to know who meshes with you the best."

Anytime I tried to fit in I couldn’t.  I found that I was always a 1 on 1 type & it takes so much convo & feeling out before determining if it’s a good fit.

The system is extremely large and complicated and we are all in specific specialty roles.  And if any particular department was extra messed up before Covid, you can rest assure it will be more messed up due to the pandemic as everyone is forced to make adjustments and switch priorities."

And you’re not wrong or dissolutioned or crazy.  You are traumatized.  Trauma makes us see the world in a whole new light.  You are only 8% of this countries population now: the veteran population. The disconnect is painful 😣"

It’s starts as us as Individuals learning from all of this and learning to say no to swiping & spending for so many things we do not need.  I’m so lucky to still have a job. But if I had not been essential.... I’m scared of how things could have turned out. And I know so many have regrets & wished they had saved more or planned differently. But they didn’t know. We know more now. Regardless of how the pandemic impacted us, hopefully we all take away something
from it. It may not always be a positive outcome,  but wisdom will come from it."

Those chemicals rush through and take over. There were sometimes I even felt unable to move.  So terrifying. It’s a vicious cycle. It’s so hard
To fight out of but when we get our momentum going it’s well worth it.  It tends to always be rocky and up & down.  There’s so many life changes/ adjustments we usually have to make before we find a good balance too"

I’m publishing a book possibly in the fall. My publisher recommended I blog. I immediately thought it was a good idea and wondered why I hadn’t done it sooner. I’ve worked in the mental health field since I was 18, (now 30) 

I have a lot of social anxiety & fear of criticism but I’m learning to get over it.  I think this is the best way to push myself and blogging proves to be a great emotional outlet as well."

I have a mental health blog. (I’m a licensed social worker) I have 8 posts total so far and I did my first Q&A blog. My question is does it make for a good read or should I stick to hush writing on my own personal topics?  I think it can go the extra mile if I do Q&As quarterly as so many people have questions regarding mental
Health.  I keep it anonymous too!  Let me know what you think of this one I would appreciate it!"
