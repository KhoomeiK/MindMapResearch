I wear my Fitbit every day and notice that every month once I get my period my resting heart rate goes down to about 60. After ovulation, it starts going up and up and up (currently at 83) until I finally get my period and I'm right back in the 60's again. It causes me a lot of anxiety."

It felt like PMDD all the time for me on YAZ. I felt so emotional 24/7. Normally regular cycle, but with YAZ I started bleeding every two weeks. I always skipped the placebo pills and the bleeding ever two weeks never stopped. The cramps weren't as bad, but I couldn't handle the emotional side effects and bleeding.

Tried switching to YAZMIN and oh boy... that was way, way worse. I had heavy bleeding for about two weeks, along with extreme fatigue, and pain in my left arm, shoulder, hand, and pain in my left leg and lower back. I ended up in the ER and they couldn't find anything wrong with me. Blood work was good, ultrasound was good, etc. Stopped taking that pill and started feeling semi normal again physically. 

Still trying to find something that works for me. Right now it's antidepressants only to see if it helps at all. 

I hope you find some relief with whatever treatment plan is right for you. ‚ù§"

I still feel afraid to go out, but I've had a bit more of a desire to do small things like go pick up some art supplies at the craft store or just take my dog for a walk lately. And now I'm back to feeling afraid."
