AmItheButtface,fpccdd4,t3_gchd1y,1588495249.0,"NTB. You know, even if he ""just got mad"" or ""didn't mean it"", the behavior didn't change. If I reacted the way he did, especially in the situations you describe, I would be extremely scared of myself and worried about my own behavior. The responsible thing then would be for me to seek help, either therapy or medication, to figure out why I was having those kinds of reactions the are completely out of proportion, and to figure out how to change and control my behavior. If somebody does something and actually do feel bad about it, they take responsibility. Responsibility doesn't just mean that they apologise, it means that they apologise, without shifting blame or making excuses, and that they then do whatever is necessary to fix their behavior, including psychiatric help, or parenting classes, or medication, or therapy. It isn't enough to feel bad and then do nothing to change.

   It also isn't an apology if it sounds like this:""I'm sorry I lost my temper and yelled and did [x] to you, but I just got mad and you pissed me off""

   What that actually means is that they feel bad about themselves but don't want to admit that something is wrong with them, so they make it sound like somehow you did something that forced them to behave in an unacceptable way, so it really is your fault and you should feel bad about making them feel bad.

   An actual apology sounds like this:""I'm sorry I lost my temper, that wasn't okay at all, and my reaction was way over the top. I'm going to do [x], [x] and [x] to make sure it doesn't happen again. I'm truly sorry, and I hope you're OK"" where the [x] should be (in the kind of situations you describe) therapy/medication/etc.

   I don't know how old you are now, but imagine in your head a random 10- or 11-year old. Then imagine them doing whatever you were doing at the time, and imagine their dad reacting the way yours did. Ask yourself, is that an appropriate response? Is that okay? How would you see it if it was happening in front of you now, but involving strangers? What you describe is really, really abusive, and in no way an ok way to treat a child, and your mom must have felt sick sending you to your dad's house every time she had to. You did the right thing by telling her what was happening, and I'm happy that you felt safe enough with your mom to tell her. She did the right thing by making sure you didn't have to live in that environment. A parent's job is to keep their child safe, it doesn't matter if that is from the other parent or from a stranger, and your mom did her job. It isn't normal or okay or healthy for a child to be afraid of their parent, and if they are, that parent should be very worried that they made their child feel that way. NTB, don't feel bad."

Whatcouldgowrong,fomgc82,t1_fomeavm,1587888997.0,"We don't actually see them interfering with anything, we hear the police guy saying they keep opening their door, which most people would do if there was sudden commotion out in the hall. They shouldn't keep doing it of course, but we don't see them interfere in anything. The police guy are inside of their apartment, and the police guy is acting very threatening towards toothbrush guy. Our police are usually pretty calm and non-threatening, so I'm surprised he is so worked up. The female police officer is still calm, so I think we can be pretty sure that police guy isn't responding to toothbrush guy being threatening. Like everyone else, police are people, and some overreact or get worked up in situations where it's unnecessary. Even if toothbrush guy says he isn't scared, that isn't a threat to the officer, and we aren't supposed to be scared of the police in general here. Even if the police guy feels like toothbrush guy is being a little disrespectful, that is not enough to warrant that reaction. Toothbrush guy keeps his distance until the officer gets in his face, he talks calmly and isn't yelling or being threatening. From what we see, he has been opening his door and asking what is happening, perhaps multiple times, which he shouldn't, but we don't know if there perhaps is a reason for that too. We have police brutality here too. Much less than most countries, but it does happen, and to me it looks like police guy is losing his temper, which he shouldn't, no matter what. He can and should use appropriate force when necessary, he can and should defend himself when he is threatened, but it should be something he decides rationally, not something he does because someone is annoying and he loses his temper. That is not how police works here. Our cops are supposed to solve problems as calmly and with as little force as possible, diffuse situations and generally keep their temper under control. That is a part of the job; being able to control yourself and not escalate situations unnecessarily. The police woman is calm, and most of our police officers are, very few of them are bad at this, but in my opinion police guy is overreacting and escalating a situation unnecessarily. That's my opinion, you can have your own, that's fine. Generally, I just trust the police here, mainly from seeing how they usually conduct themselves in a calm and collected manner in most situations, which in turn calms people down. The interactions and way I've seen them handle things in general, means that I trust them to stay calm, not panic, not lose their heads, not overreact, and to take charge and solve situations. There's a reason we aren't afraid to call them when necessary here."

I don't live in America, but we're isolating and everything is shut down here as well. I feel like Ben and I might share some issues and possibly a diagnosis. I have nothing but my own opinion to back that up. However, I live with a person, and was kinda okay before all this, but at this point I'm getting weird, I'm angry, emotional, bored out of my skull, pacing my apartment, crying on/off for no reason. I relapsed, and I'm constantly somewhat suicidal. It feels like this has been going on forever, and that it will never stop. I'm honestly going crazy, and if I hadn't relapsed I would have done something really impulsive and crazy, just to make something happen. I have no sense of time, or what day it is, or how long this has been happening. Adhd can be a bitch. I'm going insane, and I can't imagine how it is to be Ben right now. He lives alone, he has everything he does or says dissected, and he seems like he hasn't been all way ok since Kevin died. We all say or do dumb shit sometimes. And we don't have a giant group of people dedicated to listening to us, so we just have our friends tell us we're dumb, we don't have thousands of people on 5he Internet to criticise us when we say a dumb thing while being under a lot of stress already.

Leathercraft,fnv60b5,t3_g2y0m4,1587281437.0,"Hi, I taught myself some basics, but at the time I didn't want to read and really do the leg work, so I skipped a bunch of stuff (adhd can be a challenge). Now I'm starting doing this hobby again, and I bought some materials that I read how to use, but I feel unsure about the correct order of doing some of it.

   I've dyed my leather with spirit based dye (I think, the primary ingredient is ethanol it seems). I've dyed before and it's been fine, but now I've bought this eco-flo satin sheen (because the dye would rub off onto hands and such). Now, after dyeing the leather, do I use the leather wax/balm (for hydrating the leather and softening, I'm unsure what my product is called in english) before using satin sheen? If so, how long to I leave it to be absorbed before applying the sheen? Do I clean the leather first, and if so, how? Or do I just apply satin sheen after dyeing, and then use the wax stuff? Should I avoid using the was stuff completely if I'm using satin sheen?

   When burnishing the edges, do I burnish both pieces before sewing them together, or do I sew them together and then burnish? (I'm making a collar, with two layers of leather)


   I'm also making a leash, and my plan was to do it in just one layer, so I got some pretty thick leather, but of course the flesh side is somewhat ""furry"", most of it isn't bad, but there is a spot at one end where it's quite bad. I want to dye the whole thing, but I'm unsure how to do it on the flesh side. I tried sanding it, but that seemed to make it worse, and I don't know if conditioning/giving it the wax stuff will help, or if it will make it harder to dye it. Do I just burnish the whole flesh side? Does that change how I should go about dyeing it? I know a dog leash can be made with one layer, and that the whole thing can be made smooth, because I own one that I bought, but I'm not sure how to get there."

I'm not really anxious about the virus, I don't watch the news, I've been too sensitive for that for a few months, so I limit what I hear about it. I think I've just had a really long period of time where I've been a bit down and not wanted to be social or do anything, and it finally passed and I got a lot of energy and a need to be around people and do things, and then corona happened, and now I'm trapped and restless, while at the same time living in a relationship that is falling apart and dying from betrayal, in an apartment we just moved into, where I don't have enough furniture and storage to unpack half of our/my stuff, so boxes are still piled up.

mentalhealth,fltkx1q,t1_fls731p,1585477329.0,"Exactly. I couldn't have said it better. It feels like an identity crisis. Just a permanent one. And then sometimes you'll find a personality that sticks for a while, and you'll think ""finally, this is me."" but then, out of nowhere, the mask that you almost didn't notice, or at least believed would merge with the emptiness and fill it, will crack and fall off, and there it is again, the emptiness, and a little crisis follows until you decide trying on a different mask. You constantly doubt yourself, doubt your feelings, doubt other people, because when you can't know yourself, you can't trust yourself, and if you can't trust yourself, you can't trust other people. And you can't go back to when you thought you knew you, because that doesn't feel like it was you either, it all feels fake. And, like you said, people don't believe you. In a way, I don't think it's because they don't believe you as such, I think it's just such an abstract concept that there is no way anyone can imagine what it's like if they don't feel it. I don't think it's possible to understand, and it's almost impossible to explain, there aren't really words that are powerful enough. You ever read Alice in wonderland? There's a quote in it that I have tattooed on my arm:""I can't go back to yesterday - because I was a different person then"". You also put yourself in dangerous or stupid or risky situations, because you're desperately looking for yourself, and you desperately want to feel something, because if you feel something really strongly, it fills the nothingness for a while. But you can't really fit in anywhere, because nothing is quite right."
mentalhealth,fls0slo,t1_fls017t,1585431934.0,"Exactly. And it feels like faking constantly. Even as if you're faking your hobbies or interests, like it's somehow not really you. For me that's how it is at least. A lot of the time it makes me feel like I'm not actually real, like a real person, or that nothing is actually real, like really real. It's hard to explain, like a level of distance between realities. It's difficult to explain. I think it's just hard to relate to anything in a way that makes it feel real when you can't feel or relate to yourself. Like everyone have an island that is their core personality, something to stand on that makes it easy to see everyone else's islands.

But he didn't have to do anything aside from telling me to do it, and I did, and it was such a turn on.

Psychiatry,flq7bfr,t3_fq90lv,1585382129.0,"As a patient with ADHD and BPD I understand what you're saying, and I get frustrated about it with fellow patients or friends too. However, you need to remember that for us, the people living with a mental illness, it takes up a lot of time and energy. An illness isn't a personality, but it is part of who you are whe. It's a chronic condition. You deal with a patient and their illness for a specific amount of time, maybe an hour, then we leave. We deal with it all day, every day. We are frustrated and angry and some of us have a hard time accepting the direction our lives went. We deal with constantly beimg challenged and failing at normal everyday things that others around us do in 5min, no problem, we deal with the consequences of failing to succeed at those things, and with explaining and apologising to others for our failings. Sometimes, it's really hard to distinguish illness from personality or personal limitations, it can be really hard figuring out what your limits are, what you can do, what is real and true and what is your brain lying to you. Sometimes people have been in treatment for a long time, sometimes longer than you've been a doctor, and we have tried a million different things, a million medications, a million types of therapy, and constantly trying to fix something can be exhausting, and sometimes we know that something won't work for us, not because we don't want it to, but because we have experience with ourselves or have tried similar before. Some people use illness as an excuse, but there is usually a reason; we are limited and have failed so much, even with things that made no sense and we don't understand why we failed. We get tired. And I'm very much one of the people saying that illness is an explanation, not an excuse, and that we all have a responsibility to try to fix what's broken, learn how to cope, work on ourselves. But it does get really exhausting when you have to make a conscious effort all day, every single day, for the entirety of your life, to actively reflect and work on yourself, especially when you have no way of knowing what will work, when it will work, or even if it's working right now. Constant failure is hard, whether it's failing at uni or failing to do the dishes, failing to get good grades or failing to be somewhere on time. Be gentle, listen, don't make it sound like there is a simple solution, be truthful, make practical suggestions, don't let us think we can't change, but also don't make it sound like we just aren't trying hard enough. Listen to your patients, we have a lot of experience."

IUDs work great for some, but complete fucks the body of others. I would talk to a doctor about it. My hormones went completely crazy on it, and they seem to not really go fully back to normal even though I had it removed. At least I stopped losing my hair and crying all the time, and I don't have constant spotting and cramping and periods every 10-14 days, so getting it removed was the right thing in my case.

I know how hard it is to quit doing what you're doing. I was obsessive about a guy for a long time, I couldn't break free from it because he lived across from me and we were friends and on/off romantically involved, but I was in turmoil and the obsessive thoughts and behaviors were ruining my life and mental health. I eventually moved away, and having some physical distance really helped me clear my head, cut ties and move on. If it's possible for you, I would remove access to her social media if I were you. Detele and block her, or deactivate my own social media, then try to be as busy as possible to avoid slipping up and looking at it. I'm just going to warn you, if/when you do that, you'll have almost withdrawal-like symptoms; stress, anxiety, depression, racing thoughts, sweating, shaking, generally feel extremely anxious and wanting to check. But if you can get therapy and force yourself to stop ""cold turkey""-style or at least resist looking at it for as long as possible, it'll get easier. A trick I've used with quitting drugs was to just wait an hour before doing the thing. Like, if you want to look at her social media and are getting desperate, tell yourself to wait an hour/until tonight/tomorrow and then look. Then make the amount of time you have to wait before doing it longer and longer, weaning yourself off of it. It's a lot easier to wait an hour or a day than to ""never do it anymore"". Good luck and good on you for recognising how creepy and unhealthy this is. Believe me, you'll feel so much better, less stressed and anxious, when you stop doing it."

He is going to kill you or hurt you extremely bad. Bad childhood or not, abused or not, he knows that stop means stop, he knows he's hurting you, he knows that he's moving the focus from what he's doing to how you should feel bad, he knows he's ignoring your boundaries, he knows that he's ignoring not only your needs but also your physical health and safety, and he's okay with it.

Either he knows and ignores it when you tell him to stop, or when he hurts you or rapes you (which is a more than once situation just from what you mention here), and he either enjoys your pain or he doesn't care about it, or he isn't capable of telling right from wrong at all, is incapable of understandig what consent is, and is incapable of figuring out what actions will physically hurt a human. Either way, he is dangerous, he is going to hurt you. I understand that the danger is kinda fun, I get the kick that comes from being with someone who is dangerous and violent, I get being kinky and into more violent sexual stuff, I understand that it's and exquisite mix of safety and danger, that someone dangerous can get you to feel safe because you know they'll defend you, and that being in some fear of him is kinda spicy and sexy in a way, and that the danger feels like a high, but there are other ways to flirt with danger and get that high, there is such a thing as too much danger and that guy will kill or hurt you. Please think about why you're with him, think about what you would think and say if your best friend was in a relationship where these things were happening to her, would you be scared for her? I'm scared for you. I flirt with danger, I ride that fear high, but at some point you need to be critical and assess the danger realistically, and you are putting yourself at way too much risk. Run before it's too late. Run before you're too emotionally attached and get cut yourself free, run before you live with him or have kids with him, run before he hurts you seriously enough to have permanent damage, run before he kills you, please. Please think about what you're doing and why, and please run before he doesn't stop until he breaks you. Please run."
DiagnoseMe,fkrttkj,t3_fk8icc,1584475901.0,"Had similar symptoms after having a hormonal iud put in. Many symptoms disappeared after having it removed, but not all. When it was removed, doctor noticed that my cervix (I'm assuming, English isn't my first language) looked weird. Did a scrape. Cells were abnormal. Biopsy was taken at hospital. Came back cin 3, meaning very abnormal cells, the last stage of changes before cancer pretty much. Had that snippity-snip operation (I don't know the name of it in english, directly translated it would be ""cone operation"") where they remove a cone shaped piece of cervix (all the abnormal cells). After that, all symptoms went away. So, not to freak you out, get screened for cell abnormalities. First part is real easy, they just poke your cervix with a swab, then send that in.

ArtistLounge,fjrzse5,t3_ferdtk,1583591976.0,"You know, I get how you feel. But I want to remind you that you can be more than one thing in life. You can be a journalist and and artist. You can be a pizza delivery guy and a dog trainer. You can be a pilot and an artist or a nurse and a writer. You don't have to just choose one thing to be, you get to choose however many things you want. You don't have to be able to live off of your art to be an artist. An artist, from my perspective, is a person who creates things that speak to the soul of themselves or other people, or creates something that brings out feeling in themselves or others. You don't have to stop being an artist because you are also a journalist. You get to do both. People are like diamonds, there are so many different facets and sides to them, we aren't flat and just one thing. Do art again. Feed that part of yourself. Don't starve and kill it because of some bitter professor. I don't know what kind of journalism you do, but maybe try making some of your writing into art. Put the feelings or essence of whatever story you're reporting on, into canvas. A great exercise I was taught was to ""paint ugly"". Choose the colors you hate, paint something ugly. Something abstract, without thinking about it. You can't screw It up, it's meant to be ugly. In the end, it usually looks pretty cool and there's no pressure, it's a good way to start doing it again. I'm sorry someone tried to kill a part of your soul. Don't let it die, even if it seems like it's gone, you just need to nurse it back to health, take care of it, help it grow back and heal. That part of you can't be killed, it's there somewhere, otherwise you wouldn't have felt the way you did in the museum."
relationship_advice,fjrxcnd,t3_feu7dw,1583591104.0,"In your situation I would tell the girl that there are personal reasons for your brother's reaction that she couldn't have known about, that it isn't her, but that it might be better that she accept that he isn't answering her. I would also reach out to your brother and tell him that the girl contacted you and what she said, and then let him deal with it how he wants. It might be good for him to contact her in some way and explain, but it might not, and you need to let him decide for himself. When it comes to your relationship with your brother, I might try writing him letters. Not messages on Facebook or text or something, but actual physical letters that you mail, just talking about normal things, how you're doing and what's going on in your life, asking him about his life. Letters are ""slower"", the recipient has time to think about them and answer them, and it's much lower pressure, because there isn't an instant reply you have to deal with. It's a low pressure way of communicating thoughtfully with people."

And ""joins the family"" makes it sound like he's some kind of alien showing up to join a club? Maybe that's why it's annoying, apart from just how annoying flowery hippie phrases like that can be? Maybe it annoys you because it makes you sound like you're an object transporting a stranger, instead of a person developing another person with your own body? It makes me think of a UFO gliding through space, all slick and easy, no discomfort, the primary/only function of which is to transport this stranger, who is already existing and no bother whatsoever, to earth from... Somewhere? It doesn't make me think of a woman building a child in her body, with all the physical and emotional wear and tear, discomfort and potential danger that actually entails. It makes me think of flowers and birdsong, not blood and pain and other assorted bodily fluids? Like you're gonna land in a field and pop open a hatch and this fully formed adult is gonna stroll out, all chill, shaking hands with everybody, and then your job as the transportation vehicle is done? Like, it feels like its completely ignoring all the discomfort and changes you're dealing with, dismissing you as a whole human being with a purpose aside from hosting and delivering another person, and at the same time ignoring how shitty and even dangerous pregnancy can be. Maybe that's why it's getting on your nerves? Because it makes you feel like you aren't a person with a life and a purpose and because it seems like he isn't actually looking at and preparing for the reality of what birthing and taking care of a child is? Maybe it makes you doubt whether he's going to be any actual help during delivery, because he seems to ignore how gross and painful it is?"
CleaningTips,fj68raj,t3_fbkvsn,1583062391.0,"Great idea. Something I've found to be working well for me, is to start with collecting garbage. All the garbage go in garbage bags. Then, collecting all dishes from everywhere, scraping leftovers and gross shit into the garbage bags and putting the dishes in the kitchen. Then, the first thing I do is washing dishes. I usually organise it in piles, one with all the plates stacked, one with all pots and pans stacked, all glasses and cups stacked. I choose a cup or a pot and put all the silverware in it and fill it with water to let it soak. Then I wash the plates (I find those to be the easiest to get done) and then while they dry, I put the pots/bowls/whatever in the sink to soak. If I'm tired I go do something else, like watching TV or doing something I like. Sometimes I'll be returning multiple times during the day to wash a bit more, other times it takes a few days to get done, but I focus on getting dishes and kitchen clean first, because: most things have a specific place in a kitchen, somewhere all the things go, and usually you won't have filled that ""right place"" with other stuff, so you can actually put it away and get that space pretty clean without too much prep.

A trick I got from my psychiatrist is to clean in ""triangles"". Choose 3 small areas or things (for me it was dishes, coffee table, bathroom) and go between those. So when you just can't do any more dishes right now, you go clean a bit from the coffee table. When you can't get yourself to do anymore there, you go clean stuff in the bathroom. Then back to dishes, repeat.


   Also, to make cleaning easier, buy those single use cleaning wipes that are meant for specific things (bathroom wipes, stove wipes, kitchen, steel, and also the allround ones) and use those. It helps somehow that they have designated uses, you don't create a bunch of laundry, you don't have to deal with a bucket full of dirty water, or dirty washcloth, and they are white, so you can really see that you're doing something that has an effect.

   Also also, when you're in deep depression, take some steps to make it a little easier along the way, like buying disposable utensils, paper plates, those aluminium trays for cooking, plastic cups, etc. It'll make it so much easier getting yourself to eat, because you know there won't be piles of dishes, and at the same time, you can put a big trash bag in the places you eat so you can throw it out right away when you're done. That way you have less crap to deal with later, and there's the added bonus of using the aluminium trays, you can cook so many things in the oven in a tray, which means no cleaning and almost no food prep. Make things as easy as possible for yourself, so you don't feel shitty and guilty about piling up dishes, etc. And when you have a good day, cook some stuff that can go in the freezer, I do a kind of chicken burrito I made up, that i freeze individually, because I can just pull one out and pop it in the microwave, and it doesn't leave a mess in any way and can be eaten anywhere, using no dishes or utensils."

We were taught to be grateful for gifts (as in being grateful that someone gave you a gift, while at the same time that because it was the thought that mattered, it was fine to exchange a gift you didn't like to something else, as long as you said thank you), and that circumstances are different for different people, which means that some people get more than others. Our parents were honest that they couldn't afford some things, so even though it sucked sometimes when classmates got a PlayStation and a computer and 800 boxes of toys and we got a barbie each or whatever, we knew why it was like that, and didn't get bratty about it."

Most important thing that you might not be told or that are sometimes not emphasised enough, is that afterwards you might be really really sad or depressed, not because of regretting it, but because of how your hormones change. Be prepared for a lot of feelings and moodswings, a lot of which aren't really ""real"", in the sense that they are hormonal and temporary. Prepare beforehand so you don't have to cook, or go to the store, etc. Also make sure someone is with you you at home for the first day or two, in case you start feeling sick or have an errand. Be good to yourself, the first days can be hard, both physically and emotionally, and it's OK to be sad, even when you know you're making the right decision. Also, ask questions about what is going to happen afterwards, what to look out for, and who/where to call if something happens or looks weird or you have questions. And write down answers and info you're given. If you have a hard time, ask the doctor/nurse to write it down for you, or bring a friend with you who'll do it.

Borderline,fbjbl2z,t1_fbja8r5,1576929860.0,"I will say though, that I don't smile about it. We do have a tendency to want to test other people though. Imagine having a little thing in your head that keeps telling you how shitty and horrible you are, and there's no way people actually like you, there's no way they actually care about you or love you or even know you, really, and they are just pretending to, they are actually almost leaving you all the time, and they are kinda laughing about it, because they think you're pathetic, they just don't want to tell you. Imagine then, that the thing telling you that, is really loud all the time, which makes it really hard to ignore it, because no matter what people tell you or what you tell yourself, that little loud thing is loud enough that it almost completely drowns out the other stuff. How do you find out which thing is true? You test it. But the thing is, your tests are very subtle and you interpret the word/behaviors from the person you're testing in a way that is influenced by the little loud thing, because you're pretty sure it's right, because why would people love you? So the answers you get are not objective. At the same time, people don't know a test is in progress. And you get angry and sad and hurt by the conclusion you reach, but you know it's unfair, because you know you demand too much, and the test doesn't actually tell you anything, so you're still in doubt, and you also know that you can't trust the interpretations and feelings you have, so no matter what you are in constant doubt and turmoil. It's a shitty position. That doesn't make it ok to do, and it hurts people you love, and you know that. That's sometimes what's going on. And it's very difficult to change, let alone even be aware of. Being with someone who has bpd is difficult sometimes.

Either I'll keep feeling that way and I then talk to him about it, or in an hour or a day max it will have passed and I don't know why I cared about it.

Dermatology,f9mweyp,t1_f9mvwak,1575471755.0,"It isn't actually just around the nails though, the middle toe it's the whole toe in the area that's red but not just on the top of it, on the big toe it's only at the top/end part of the toe, the skin is very shiny. There also doesn't seem to be any kind of puss or pocket of it anywhere. You might be right though."
Dermatology,f9muetn,t1_f9mt2s6,1575470508.0,"Nope, nothing, except two days ago at night they were even darker red and extremely painful and I put vaseline on them. I'm not sure how I thought that would help, I think it was to kind of lubricate them so it might hurt less when they touched each other. But aside from that, I haven't taken anything for it or put anything on them. I don't have sweaty or wet feet in general, and the skin itself is shiny and bumpy now, but it isn't shedding or dry or anything."
Dermatology,f9mu28g,t1_f9mtc6s,1575470285.0,"I'm in Scandinavia, it's about 8Â°C, so a bit cold but not horribly. It's just on the toes, but nothing really visible on the other foot, and on that one it's mainly at night. I also have very dry skin on my hands and sometimes get tiny blisters on them but there's nothing on my hands at the moment. My feet are kind of tingling or buzzing, and the one in the pic feels like it's on fire in the middle toe, that toe also feels heavy. Also they've turned a kind of bluish color but the toes are still dark red."
Dermatology,f9mq40d,t3_e5zh3j,1575467568.0,"In the beginning both feet were just tingly and falling asleep, then they felt really hot at night but looked normal, now they are red, warm, swollen and feel like they're on fire on one foot, still tingly and warm at night on the other one, also both are incredibly itchy. My doctor hasn't seen it before, he gave me some lotion for fungus but he isn't sure at all that that's the problem. There are weird bumps and the skin seems shiny, it isn't really blisters, just a lot of uneven bumps"
AmItheAsshole,f9jh0s6,t3_e57shn,1575373953.0,"Take it from me. I have the same issues as your sister, plus adhd on top of it. Also the same issues when it comes to my mother. Do not let her move in. It will not help her, and it will not be good for you. In a few months (if that long, depending on the severity of her diagnosis and personality) you will will have your mom's role in the dynamic between her and your sister. It will be hell, and you will probably have been roped into the circle of rage and depression and guilt, and it will be really difficult for you to set boundaries and kick her out without feeling like a monster. Don't misunderstand me; yes, we can be angry, manipulative assholes with victim complexes, but we don't do it on purpose (in most cases, some probably do, but none of the ones I know do it consciously), we honestly feel the way we're expressing, we honestly believe what we're saying, and it honestly feels as big and dramatically extreme as we express/react. It's exhausting and draining and one big awful explosion. Even so, explosions have casualties, innocent ones, and afterwards some things or relationships or people have been destroyed and can't be saved. Your sister should not live with your mom, no, it isn't helpful to anyone, but she definitely shouldn't be living with you either. If she's incapable of taking care of herself, she should be in assistant living. She should be getting some kind of behaviour therapy. With time and work and effort she can learn to manage herself and her reactions and somewhat also her emotions, but you can't help her, it has to be her. I would tell her that you love her, but you can't live with her. Tell her you'll help her look at her options if she (and you) want, but that she can't live with you. Then give her some time to cool down/be sad/whatever she does, and then don't bring it up again. If she brings it up, tell her you love her, but that you talked about that already and then change the subject or leave her to cool off by herself. For most of us, we have an instant, extreme emotional response, it's like af storm, but after it blows over, we can (a lot of the time) see that it was an overreaction, and we don't actually feel that way anymore. It's just a constant changing sea of emotions that are amplified to a degree where we can't stop it in the moment and fills us up so fast and intensely that we have to react. Afterwards the sea is calmer and easier to navigate."

You can also choose to be sorry for being a shitty friend, try to do better, and the chances of forgiveness and understanding from friends will be a lot bigger. This is why people think bpd means that we're toxic and abusive and have no empathy. So, thanks for contributing to the already overwhelming stigma surrounding this disorder. Thumbs down man."
ADHD,f8cmop5,t3_e03k8p,1574463686.0,"I'm the same way. The future doesn't really seem close or real at all. Deadlines and obligations don't feel real until right before they happen. I've had some small success by using egg timers for this. Set it to about 20minutes where I have to put everything down and work on whatever it is. Then set the egg timer to 15 or 20 minutes where I get to do something else. Then 20min of work. And so on and so forth. It doesn't work if I use my phone for it, because then I have to pick up my phone to check how long is left or I snooze or end it without really noticing. Only a physical egg timer works for me."

relationships,f88m10t,t1_f88jpbm,1574356951.0,"I'm in my late 20s but was diagnosed at 18 (the psychiatrist probably knew when I was 15/16 but in my country you can't diagnose personality disorders before 18). It's gotten a lot better for me. Some of it is age, but mostly I put it down to being in therapy with a psychiatrist, medication, and being very aware of what the disorder is. Knowing what it means and understanding the reactions/traits makes it easier to control. Getting good therapy, being open to medication, putting in the work outside of the psych office, and doing a lot of introspection and evaluating my own thoughts and behavior, making a conscious and critical effort to figure out what needs to change and working on it, is the key. I've met some other women that were diagnosed later in life than I was, and I could definitely tell that they were just now aware and just started therapy. It takes work, but it does get a lot better and easier. It never goes away, but you can be in control, and that's a lot better. People are also a lot more willing to understand and sometimes forgive if they know that you're actively working on it."
relationships,f8201sf,t3_dyjjvr,1574181093.0,"Other people probably have a lot of good advice, I mostly want to comment on the thing about her not finding the therapist helpful. Of course, it might have been a bad therapist. However, I have bpd, and I used to do what she's doing. A lot. It wasn't that I wanted to manipulate or threaten, I really felt like I wanted to leave and end the relationship. But only for the duration of the argument. I still feel that way in some arguments, but I don't say it out loud, because I know it's temporary and that I don't actually want that. It took me 8 years of therapy (at a psychiatrist) and meds to learn that, and to learn how to control it and stop myself. And I put a lot of work in. I also knew it was a problem, so I was motivated going in. There's just this thing about us bpd people, especially the older we get without proper therapy, that we decide sometimes that the therapy doesn't work or the therapist is a bad one, because they tell us stuff we really don't like. And the problem is that even though we're wrong, it really feels like we're right, and we really belive it. So perhaps your wife didn't so much have a bad therapist, as she was maybe told something she didn't like,. I'm not saying she has bpd, but there are parallels, and the reason might be similar."
relationship_advice,f7zi7kw,t1_f7ymz91,1574111074.0,"On hormonal birth control I was nauseous all the time. I got acne, not a little, but large cyst like things, that got so big I had migraines because of how much pressure was under my skin in my forehead. My hair fell out in handfuls. I was in in pain, feeling like I was getting stabbed in my left ovarie at 4andom intervals, the pain was enough to make me lightheaded and make my legs weak. I was crying on/off multiple times pr week for no reason. I was too anxious to do anything, and too tired to be around anyone. I was spotting/bleeding for 3 weeks at a time, with 1 or 2 weeks without blood if I was lucky. My skin dried out, and so did my vaginal.. My boobs were sore all the time, to the point where any and all bras were hurting me. I was either crying or raging. I stuck it out for a year. Then I had it removed and that helped. It's great for you that you haven't had problems, but don't think for a second that the only risk of hormonal birth control is discomfort or thrown off cycles. The fact that it's like that for you, doesn't mean that it isn't 1000 times worse for someone else.

   I agree that she should have told him she changed her mind, but don't make it seem like there isn't any potential problems just because you don't have them."
