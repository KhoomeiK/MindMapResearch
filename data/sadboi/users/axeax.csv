I say that because I suffer from several mental illnesses and it happens so often that I feel extremely bad, even suicidal, about... Well, nothing. Or better, I literally don't know. If you are being studied, whether it's you, your mind, or another entity, it's a pretty good thing in my eyes because perhaps it could help you deal with your emotions by understanding yourself.

Surely what happened to your daughter is a dead giveaway of what makes you feel pain, but this doesn't mean it can't get to a better state and starting from analysis sounds like the right way to start with. I surely can't know the pain of a dead, but I definitely know how it feels to feel extremely bad to the point of thinking you can't feel worse and it will never get better. However, when I'm rational, I think there might still be a way and thus these hidden information we get in dreams can be useful.

techhelp,fpkcwau,t3_g9i02t,1588692379.0,"First off, are you able to identify the camera physically? If not, you can help yourself by trying to analyse the magnetic field magnitude on various parts of the room. There are several apps for that.
Secondly, it's possible that the camera is connected to a LAN which shares the same network mask as the house/hotel/whatever it is. In such case, then yes, it _could_ be possible to access to the camera activity, or at least see if it's transmitting something. I can't tell about recording as in ""storing video files"" as it's likely to be a real-time streaming.
If the dude has an internet connection for your room and you have access to it, I'd strongly recommend you to connect to that network and type the camera's ip address in your browser to see what happens. Also try to check for the camera model and look for its manual, if you can, in case it uses particular ports or also requires passwords that could be set to a default value. If nothing useul happens, try using wireshark or any packet sniffing software and take a snapshot for some minutes. This could help seeing when the camera syncs to the local server, and if the data is big, then yes, there are high chances that it is streaming video, and you can see what device is it sending to by analyzing packets (we can do this if you don't know how). If none of the previous worked, I think it's better for your safety to advise the local authorities about this camera detection AND the weird behaviour of the host. They'll take care of the rest."

Actually, [according to G Suite's FAQ](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2618874?hl=en), Google's set of tools provides more detailed informations. Not sure _how much_, but at least it allows for the viewing of emails' header. I don't think it will have the SMTP log, but still, it could be useful. The Google dashboard seems also easy to use.
Btw, about the image, any file hosting website will do :) Just upload it as a file and not as an image (perhaps it's even better to zip it first, just to be sure).

Thetruthishere,fpi9cbl,t3_gdf3gj,1588636265.0,"That's why I dislike email clients that don't show a console output AND log it. The first thing I'd try to do is to recover the email and check its metadata. Depending on what client and protocol you're using (IMAP, POP3) it could be possible to retrieve the email back, as POP3 stores a cached version (even if you deleted it, depending on the filesystem where it used to be stored, it's possible to recover the file at least partially). The most useful information would be to obtain the IMAP or SMTP messages exchange. Unless your client allows that, the best way to do so imho would be to use a packet sniffer (or just logger) and look for TCP packets; there will be many, but software like Wireshark can help you filter things out.
Now, that would be ideal if you were to have a packet sniffer running 24/7, but if you don't, then all we can hope for is log files AND metadata from the email.

So, what client did you use? Is it web-based?

Moreover, another useful information would be the picture's metadata. As I pointed in another post, if you can send the original file (not processed by imgur), we can take a look at the image's EXIF data and see what phone was done it from, where, at what time, and some other things.

Some people in the comments pointed out address spoofing. I don't agree this is the case because from what I've read you're using gmail. Assuming it's still using SMTP for communication, it can still implement an authentication process. And I'm sure google is not that stupid as to allowing the editing of a simple line of a packet. Another option would be aliases, but they should stay within the same mailserver. And while a conflict of same aliases is not guaranteed (since the headers of the packet include the real email address), we're still talking about Google, which I highly doubts allows it for same usernames.

tl;dr
1. What client do you use to _receive_ emails? Not the mailserver, but the client (web clients, apps, thunderbird, outlook desktop version etc);
2. If it's a web client, is there a trash bin icon in order to retrieve the email?
3. Can you post the original image file? Neither processed by the email client nor by imgur. The former may be negligible, but it's important that you send the very same file you received and not an imgur version

Moreover, there might be some cache if you used the browser when you opened the email, a cache which could contain logs (even though they're probably stored in Google's servers themselves, but you never know)."

Thetruthishere,fpb1zyr,t1_fp8zwzm,1588460432.0,"If he gets sleep paralysis, then it is likely that he dreams. There are various research papers that suggest different throries*, but they all have one thing in common: REM sleep phase. It's generally thought that it's eiither its fragmentation, or a dysfunctionallity that happens between REM phase and waking phase. Fact is, the REM phase is associated to dreaming. Hence, if your bf is able to enter the REM phase, it's very plausible that he dreams. Moving to the psychoanalysis theory, my psychotherapist told me that our mind forgets dreams that convey too much information that is hidden within our conscious state, as during that phase your subconsicous is talking to you. If this is accepted, then if he dreams stuff that could be traumatic consciously, then it's possible that he might dream, but he's protecting himself by not remembering.

*I've taken this information purely on research papers. Since I'm not a doctor in medicine, context could add other variables that may imply that this is not the case. After all, neural networks are complex systems :)

As far as my field is concerned, I would firstly, as I said in a previous comment, install a camera that is able to detect infrared light and map it to the visible light spectrum. Record every night and if nothing happens, well, I'd instantly try to use a movement sensor along with a signal detector that has as much bandwidth as you can afford, so that you cover more frequencies. Thus, a spectrometer. Those are expensive though and so I would just use a camera, see when the scratches start to show, and pause => look at the exact timestamp, and perform a frequency analysis of the signal recorded by the signal receiver when sampled at that timestamp. If you see a flat output, then it's safe to say no supernatural stuff is going on, because there's no way that any kind of invisible entity would be able to move stuff - and itself - without dissipating power. And the dissipated power will then be absorbed and transformed into energy for the already-existing electromagnetic waves that should, in fact, experience, a disturbance from their stationary state.
One drawback from doing this is that you can be decdived by already existing signals, even for example your phone. But a filter with low roloff at these frequencies should be enough to filter things out (stuff like atmospheric or thermal noise are approximately white, so this should stay invariant).

If instead you have a spectrometer, you can just let it running during full nights and let it advise you when there are suspicious spikes in certain frequencies, aka it will do all the job for you."

So, even if he doesn't have nails that are _this_ sharp, perhaps he could still cause that if he's having a seizure and starts using ""powered up"" and fast, incontrollable moves?

So, it's right to say it's not a ""sedative"" per s√©, but its sedative effects, when attenuated by low doses, basically make the drug act also as an hypnotic (aka a sleep inducer) - so it's just easier to say ""sedative"", since imidazondhdjdjejehedheheuhshsjeieurhe is annoying to pronounce and write. I've never seen Ambien used as an anxiolitic, but its effects are practically the same as those of benzodiazepines, which are used mainly as anxiolitics (or as hypnotics if, for example, you're starting a new therapy whose first side effects are sleep deprivation). For this reason, it's also referred to as a nonbenzodiazepine.

It was the night of what should have been my first University day ever in a few hours, when my mother was awoken by weird noises. It turned out I was having a very bad seizure. I wasn't even able to walk for 2 days at least. The hospital dismissed me after 1 week, focusing on some lungs potential cancer after a TAC (which went then away on its own, confirmed by a PET and another TAC) and they didn't care at all about the seizure. I am diabetic, so they immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was a hypoglycemic attack. The same year, I had a worse seizure, and this time I also stayed in coma for a while, just right after having had the feeling that someone who was not there in reality was stalking me - started screaming, doing weird stuff, spitting blood, etc.
This time they bought me to another hospital, this time for less than 1 day. Brain TAC again, they find nothing in the brain => it was a hypoglycemic attack.
Then, I reach out to a private neurologist, who was mad at the doctors for not having made me do an electroencephalogram and a MRI, despite I clearly stated in all cases that I got a head trauma after I got beaten up during a vacation in Paris. Did both, and boom, the electroencephalogram, along with parents' and friends' description of the events, confirmed I suffer from epilepsy.

But sounds like she already did, which is amazing. :3
I hope you will both feel good forever and that guy won't ""spawn"" again in your lives - if not to help you. If I were to believe in spirits, I'd be more convinced that he's a good entity, for some reason.
But hey, if he annoys you, just call me - I have a weird sensation when I see long nails and I want to devour them (that's why all my nails are perfectly sized), I'm sure he wouldn't approach you anymore ;) (ofc I'm joking to make things less dramatic, but yeah, I kinda have this nails instinct due to anxiety). I'm really curious about his face though. Damn, it would be so cool if someone could capture an instance of him... I'd use any kind of analysis tool to get as many details as possible. Ugh."
Thetruthishere,fp1fg9o,t1_fp1aurm,1588233720.0,"Oh, I see... The way you wrote it truly made me get very suspicious, despite still believing you - well, I must say I envy your skills, they really ""deceived"" my instinct and I like that :)*
Now everything's more clear; I can't deny the whole thing is really creepy, especially with the timing, which I remark, is truly perfect - but a random process can surely have a sample in which the scenario covers all those points, I don't rule that out ^^ it's simply... So perfect. Dunno how to describe it. Your answer sounded much more sincere, so again I'm more inclined to believe you, and of course support you for what happened. I think I can relate with your friend and since you're acting rationally about a mental disorder I thank you because that's a very rare thing (nowadays a little less, but still). Are you still in touch with her? I hope she finds good meds.
It's really a pity your parents took it as a nightmare or this sort of stuff and didn't install some electromagnetic waves receivers without filters - that could have helped a lot in solving the mystery (or making it even more interesting!), imho.

*(btw, I'm also a member of nosleep and bought some books - it wasn't a critique or stuff like that, just a personal observation; in fact, I really enjoyed reading your events, depsite feeling sorry for what happened. These rare feels I somehow get, despite mixed, are the reason why sometimes I still feel human. So thanks)"
Thetruthishere,fp1a29b,t3_gafwhd,1588228822.0,"I really don't want to sound like an asshole, but this sounds like stuff written in r/nosleep. Of course, my point of view is prejudged by the fact that I'm not a paranormal believer, but I've been here around for some time and I keep enjoying reading about that stuff, it's interesting. And so was yours, and well written. But unlike many others, this one sounds a bit too off to me. The reason is that the timing is a little too perfect, for every event. Your friend staying still instead of following you, her sudden disappearance due to her mother (for just a single event, despite you shared basically your entire life from what I read), your reaction time being almost perfect so that you couldn't identify the dude's face while he was turning... It's a personal perception, I'm not saying you're lying, but the whole reading for me was like a story. But again, I'm not saying stuff *in general*, just my personal feelings about it.

&#x200B;

That said, assuming everything's true, which I always do in this sub, I see from the commentators' experiences that this always happened during a stressing situation. Now, of course, hearing/seeing claws while your dog is supposed not to be there can rightfully make your anxiety level rocket, so I wouldn't be surprised if that figure you saw was just a shadow. And considering your detail about your ""it wasn't that bad"", it sounds like you were trying to somehow ""relax"" the situation; but especially as a child, I can imagine being still anxious and over-reactive. So, apart from the writing that resembles me of a story for its structure, I *do* believe you, but I think you kind of had a panic attack or these sort of things. I don't see how going to a mental hospital could be correlated to this incident, even though the fact that it happened exactly after this event sounds odd; but, it could also be that she was already schizophrenic and after this event she may just got actually checked (note: I'm not correlating schizophrenia with the sight of the Hat Man) - schizophrenia is not like in the movies, and it can be very mild to the point that one may think it's just the character of a person, much like depression which gets often belittled with a simple ""it's all in your head, think positive"". But then again experts know their stuff better and thus after some sessions they might have found out something out of her.

&#x200B;

That's my personal thought, but I'm not excluding - even if I don't believe in such interpretations - that it could be a paranormal encounter. In such case though I think: why would he keep tormenting her, and not you? Have you seen him again, and if not, why would he keep tormenting indirectly? According from another encounter in the comments, he appeared after a near-death scene, so it can be a possibility that it wasn't due to ""stress"", but maybe he just may appear again right before you're about to die (?). Having different mental disorders myself, I consider my ""internal being"" basically dead, so if she feels the same way maybe that's why he's still annoying her. But what excludes, in such case, that he's not just a benign being trying to advise you of potential life-threatening danger?"

But, it can happen that when we're younger we did stuff we don't really remember or don't remember why we did them. I made a creepy joke to my parents when I was like 3, and I exploited the fact that they didn't know I had information about the event on which the ""jok e"" was based on. Moreover, I was also able to fake my own calligraphy despite me being just a child. I remember everything about it, but I don't remember why I did such an evil action - I just waited to watch them getting really worried and confused and then I revealed it was me, only after observing (I lied at first, saying I didn't write it).
Perhaps someone did something like that and they don't even remember it, while lying about not having done it during the moment (just a thought)"
Thetruthishere,fos27w9,t3_g95aun,1588022637.0,"I think a little more details may be useful. She found that pic on her phone, but where? A messaging app? Gallery?
If it's the Gallery integral photo, could you host the actual file instead of a reprocessed version in imgur? The goal of this is to export EXIF data and see when, where, and what phone was this actually taken on.
I mean, it's sufficient to run a UNIX touch command to make the file look like it was taken at a certain time, while the EXIF data, while still editable, are more reliable imho. It would also be interesting if the pic was actually taken in another phone and the GPS location was spoofed.
Also, that figure looks like a ghost version of Gaahl from ex-Gorgoroth and God Seed lol."
FPGA,fnrs0nj,t3_g3dzo7,1587199364.0,"My introduction to digital systems electronics course has my professor teaching us VHDL. However, I would have loved some more supported and less-proprietary alternatives, hence Verilog.
Running software like Quartus Prime or anything that supports VHDL was and is a huge pain in my computer, since I use Gentoo GNU/Linux and VHDL devs seem not to like it too much.

I'll tell you, in Italy, VHDL is much, much more used and popular than Verilog, and if it's like so in other countries, unfortunately you have to adapt yourself and your system to learn both. Still, if it's just about learning, when you learn one you automatically learn also the other, in terms of language, because syntax and semantics are very similar (I've almost finishef reading both standards and they're pretty much converging for now, except for the high level stuff like case, process and that stuff in VHDL). I'm more of a low-level software programmer than hardware, so my opinion may be biased because I hate both languages, but  for a start, just to have less pain, I'd say go for Verilog. However, if by any chance you come from a high level software engineering background, I think VHDL is much more readable in some cases. Still, they both stink."

FPGA,fmgphvm,t1_fmegarc,1586054440.0,"Thank you a lot! I guess my initial doubt was indeed a part you mentioned, ""some institution built the first compiler/interpreter for HDL"" - in fact, I couldn't get how could it be possible to build the first compiler without having something close to a computer in the first place (as you said, you need a programming language to creare a compiler for a new language). Some comments hinted it was made by hand, and as I was awed of the thought of such a complex task, other comments completed by adding that each task was actually just an extension of previous ""building blocks"", as I understood it. Your comment also adds that there's something else before FPGAs, which indeed confirms how everything was gradual; at the end of my analog electronics course I was able to build logic circuits by means of op amps, simple stuff like comparators etc., and also flip flops. But then, from there, we quickly jumped to digital systems and digital transmission, the former being an extremely big jump for me because I felt like I was definitely missing something, while digital transmission was very backupped by a strong signals and systems background from previous courses.
As I see from your comment, there is some kind of preallocated ""memory"" which defines a behaviour which is not initialized until you use a synthesis tool. That's very interesting but it kinda adds a new level to the question about the first compiler: how was the first programmable device made such that it could support this LUT in a way that it can be filled up by a tool which itself was not made yet? Like, what I find incredible is that all of that could be possible by the mere use of analog electronics - not using a computer to compile that stuff looks soooo complex to me. And so interesting! I'll look at the missing pieces of theory from the books suggested, and I'm sure those questions will somehow be answered, thank you!"

We use stuff like quartus prime and modelsim, but if I don't see their source code for me it's just pure sci-fi because I'm not 100% sure of how they do all the stuff they do.

Perhaps it's because of my computer science background, but I also find it easier at this stage; the only continuous domain stuff I have faced for now is whatever is related to, as you said, timing thresholds and that kind of stuff - actually the very beginning of the course looked like, to me, a very simplified version of the digital transmission course, in which we basically dealt with the physical layer of tcp/ip. Analog courses instead were so hard for me; we had to take so many variables into account, including even small things like capacitive effects or temperature nonidealities which basically made me wonder where even to start.
