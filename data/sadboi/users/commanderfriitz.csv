schizoaffective,fqg9cxs,t1_fqf7xgr,1589340805.0,"Well, i was always a very extroverted person, so i dont think autism is my problem but im sorry to hear that. At least you got someone you can talk to and understands what you are going through. Well its a long process my psyquiatrist told me so, but i never thought it was gonna  be so long... im on this medication for 8 months and its not enough to make get a grip on reality. I think im gonna have to change them. But im happy you found the right meds for you, its such a gamble"
schizoaffective,fqf6m8h,t1_fqf26pa,1589319586.0,"Yeah bro, i can relate. I make tiny bits of communicating with friends and family and im tired just from that. As for the hallucination and paranoia the meds take care of that, more or less but i am unable to make connections woth people.

schizoaffective,fqerj6p,t1_fqe0wy0,1589312407.0,"Thank you for your kind words, it helps me alot knowing there are those who understand even if they dont experience this. Unfortunally there is no one i know who can relate in a similar way and thats why im afraid to even talk to anyone about my situation because they will see it as a weakness or they will judge. But i think im gonna have to, maybe i will find someone understanding and with the patience to help me get trough this like you did with your partner. Thank you really, you dont understand the relieve that is knowing we are not alone, because this is a lone battle against ourselfs and its as you said we are terrified and dont really wanna hurt anyone cause we are the ones hurt the most. Appreciated kind stranger you are a wonderfull person and your partner is really lucky to have someone like you in his life."

I dont really ask for that much, only to have the will to talk to people and have something to talk to them. My doctor doesnt seem to be willing to change my meds, im taking them for the 8 months i been diagnosed and it did help, for the hallucination maniac and deprresive state. But not the anti social part... wanting to talk but not being able to ends up making me depressed and its a loop. Of constant getting better and getting depressed"

schizoaffective,fq74gu9,t3_gh01zo,1589141669.0,"I can relate to this. Ever since i remember i cant organize stuff, not my thoughts or even my bedroom. Its like everything is on a different language. I think you can get better at organizing, like creating habits, or having a specific place for a specific thing or organizing in alphabetic order or something. You just have to find a way that suits you, im sure there is one. You can find comfort in yiur own mess"
