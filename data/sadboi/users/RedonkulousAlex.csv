Now normally I would never want to get in trouble or let people know I was on my period, but I was desperate and I was starting to see that was bleeding through the front of my jeans, but I mentally said fuck it and stood up, ""I am bleeding it's messing up my pants and it's gonna get on my chair if you don't let me leave right now."" Now I totally could just walked out and just let him call my parents so I could make him feel stupid after telling my parents why I walked out of class. But too late now lol"

The following year another guy died inside his home, he was working out and didn't have someone helping him, he was on the bench laying down and I guess he got too tired for the last lift of the weight and it dropped on his chest or throat it's been over 6 years so I don't remember the details perfectly. I honestly didn't know either of them so it didn't really effect me. However both times the school as a whole was sooo depressed and silent. Not to make generalizations but my school was on the west side, in other words very ghetto. These 2 kids dying managed to quiet the school for days. It was pretty crazy"

A middle ground can be reached here, where on others it becomes a screaming match, or if you think different your experience/feelings are belittled, or called dramatic, and calling my pregnancy a baby/girl is seen as Anti-abortion language.

Unfortunately for me, my body didn't take it and I felt absolutely everything and was wide awake. And even now I can pinpoint the exact pains and what instrument caused them. The nurses didn't do anything but tell me to breathe through it all. They didn't hold my hand or give me anything to grab or hold. If something doesn't feel right please let the nurses know and don't let your worry fall on deaf ears. My nurses didn't try to give me more meds, or wait to see if the first would set in. Speak up make it urgent. Your safety matters and will definitely save you grief, and possible physical/mental trauma. I wish you the best of luck and hope you heal quickly. ‚ù§"

Writing notes to myself, and to my lost little one has helped me. The hurt will fade over time for sure. Can't promise it will completely vanish, but once the more dominant tears an ache fade. You'll be able to really read everything through.  We learn from pain, obviously we wish that wasn't always the case.  You'll be ok though. It lessens as time goes by. A good thing will come from this. I wish you the best"
abortion,fdte14w,t3_emup1k,1578715421.0,"It just means you're human. Think your reasons over as much as you can...weigh out the outcomes if you continue with aborting, or with keeping the baby at least to term (adoption being another route). Hurt will happen...where it stems from is different for ever individual. For me..my physical pain was only for a day. My emotional pain however has me in tears every day. I realized too little too late that I did want my baby. I would go through that physical pain a million times over if I could have her back. For you and others that may not the case. Think it through...more than I did... sorry if my note was a bit hard to read through...I wish you the best now, and for the future you walk."

I'm really sorry I did write in the title possible trigger, i knew that some part of thos would hurt i more expected my explanation of my pain during the abortion would be it but I wasn't  sure. As for my use of she, and baby to refer to my pregnancy it's genuinely how I felt it was. Whenever my BD and I talked about it my answers without thinking or processing how to describe everything was just that and it was even stronger after seeing my ultrasound, I didn't see a ""clump of cells"", I saw a body, a heart, arms, and legs, I saw a tiny person which I felt was my daughter. Referring to my pregnancy as anything else felt wrong, or cold. If those are anti terms I'm sorry.  They made the most sense for me to use, and clearly expressed how my heart was, and became. I'm not trying to hurt anyone."
