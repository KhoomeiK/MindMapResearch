For me, I found myself playing through episodes 4 and 5 just so I could see how it ended. I will say that they did a decent job on the final decision of the game. But the story was not interesting enough to keep hold of my curiosity. It was bland and uninspired. Some of the best parts were the call backs to season one because it made you feel nostalgic. I don't know whether Dontnod should've stuck with characters from season one, but I do know that they should've been able to think of a better plot than what they gave us. After all, they gave us Life is Strange. Still one of my favourite games ever."
