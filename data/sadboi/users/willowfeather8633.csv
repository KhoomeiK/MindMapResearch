teenagers,fnsyl0l,t3_g3i45m,1587231256.0,"I’m the mom, but I filled out the form with my 16 year old son in mind.  He has morphed into a nocturnal person for the plague-a-palooza so he won’t be up for awhile.  I don’t limit anything.  He’s a great guy, and he’s going to be an adult in a year and a half so I’m always keeping that in mind as I hopefully prepare him for life.  He cooks dinner twice a week, does the dishes twice a week.  If the gaming room gets stupidly messy with hot pocket wrappers and popcorn and empty coke bottles I just ask him to pick up and he does it.  He puts away groceries and takes out the trash and does his own laundry.  He doesn’t argue, and I give him $20 a week for 7/11 runs, or whatever.  My 12 year old daughter isn’t as easy going as my son, and argues about chores,but she eventually follows through.  I strive to remember that I had kids that I want to like when their grown up.  It seems to have worked.  I really like them."
