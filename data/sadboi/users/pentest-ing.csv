Dr. Manhattan says he'll leave this galaxy for another one. So if he's gone that could be Veidt in present day practicing he's new powers. But I really don't know I haven't seen the thread where people discuss it."

EDM,f0jtpmp,t1_f0js9v7,1568662811.0,"What I want to do is take in as many factors in as possible. They're places where you can listen to ""underground/under-represented' artists and places for mainstream artists. I want to say hey, maybe let's not book the same person thats been here many times and give this other artist a try, based on what would work for a particular venue, festival, etc."
EDM,f0jrgcm,t1_f0jrbwg,1568661286.0,I'm personally talking about ultra Miami but I understand.
EDM,f0jrefx,t1_f0jm4il,1568661250.0,"Thank you, I think those are both great ideas. Thank you for heads up of  'socialblade', I'll take a look at that."
EDM,f0jrako,t1_f0jqvu9,1568661175.0,But the idea is to book those up and coming artists. Did you look at the set times last year? Nicky Romero and fredde Le Grand came before Alesso. The only input I can't put in is how much it costs to book them but I would bet they'd get a better show if either of those artists replaced them. That's just my 2cents though. That's why I want to bring in hard statistical data to show the numbers.
EDM,f0jqivc,t1_f0jmiko,1568660636.0,"That's what I would have assumed as well. But I always thought why Alison wonderland , illenium, rezz (correct me if I'm wrong), have never played mainstage ultra meanwhile they're selling out venues. It could be because that's the type of festival ultra wants to be, mostly house on mainstage, or they're missing the chance to bring in new talent for the world to see. Lots of people tune in to see live sets every year, it would be nice to see some new ones no ?"
EDM,f0jq83w,t1_f0jpwo2,1568660419.0,"No, you are. They're plenty of festivals that should book more up and coming artists. There's some talent I've seen being booked over and over again. Think about the artist, if he or she plays at a venue that doesn't get close to sold out chances are that person isn't going to come back, not to mention it's a loss in their pocket. Although money isn't a big deal to me or you that's what keeps artists fed."
EDM,f0jq0f9,t1_f0jldfd,1568660264.0,"Yes I've heard that as well. Apparently the market in Asia heavily uses sites like dj mag to book talent. Something like this would save them money. I could statistically show them which artists are specifically hot in their city or region, who people would actually like and pay to see."
