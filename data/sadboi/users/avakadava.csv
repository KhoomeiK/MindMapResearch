Another guy I dated said his name was John and he was from France and he was a non smoker. The truth was he was from Lebanon and his name was Ibrahim. And he was a smoker 

Another guy lied to me that hed deactivated his Facebook account, when through my investigation I saw that he did in fact have a FB account. It wasn't like he was actively using it, it was just that he still had a photo of his ex with him on his profile picture that he hadn't taken down (he's an introvert and doesn't like being put in the limelight, which would've have probably happened if he removed that pic of her)
