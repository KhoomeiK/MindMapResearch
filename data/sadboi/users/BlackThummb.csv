offmychest,fpxqoyd,t3_gfug3c,1588987648.0,"I was in a relationship with a guy for 2 years who was open about his high porn use. At the time I didn’t mind, but he was so obsessed with a threesome, that he would always be badgering me for one after we had sex. It was making me uncomfortable, and even though I really didn’t want to lose him, I had an honest conversation with him. 

I told him “I don’t want you to bring up having a threesome ever again. Every time you bring it up, despite me expressing multiple times that I’m not comfortable with it, it makes me feel like I’m not enough for you. I will never want to have a threesome, and if that’s something that is important to you, than I think we are incompatible.” 

The look on his face I will never forget. It was as if he was waking up from a splash of cold water, and to my surprise he said he would never bring it up again. But his kinks just kept changing, and it got to the point where he couldn’t get an erection from vanilla sex. He finally stopped watching porn, and our sex life improved, but I had already had one foot out the door by that time. I felt like I was being used as a sex toy, and that he didn’t really respect me. I’m a lot more vocal now about my views on sex, and if guys don’t like it (which is many sadly), I don’t bother wasting my time or his anymore. 

I’m glad there are men out there like you. I just have yet to meet one in the wild."

They demand people acknowledge them in certain ways, while also denying certain realities. Most people will be polite, and strive to treat someone the way they want to be treated. But most people also don’t want to lie and do theatre for others to make them feel better. And here in becomes the problem for trans people: if someone doesn’t treat them as the gender they identify with, than they don’t feel valid. Their happiness and contentment is dependent on how others see and treat them, and not from within. Self love is important for every single human to find, because we can’t control our relationships with other people, but we can control our relationship with ourselves. Validation is internal , and I think many trans people seek validation externally."

Also found out he lied about his age when I initially met him. Totally wasn’t interested and was plotting my escape. 

I said let’s get the bill, we’ll split it. He insisted on paying for it, I insisted that I didn’t want him to pay for my half. I asked the waiter for the bill when he came around, and he left to go get it. My date excused himself to go to the bathroom, when in reality he had paid for the bill at the waiter station. I was pissed, told him it was underhanded to pay when I didn’t want him to. 

He drove me home, and when we get to my place I immediately get out of the car, and he runs after me. He says “wow you don’t make it easy for a guy to get a kiss.” I said I wasn’t interested in him, and that I was sorry but I didn’t want to see him again.

It’s not promoting the use of leather, because the people who sell leather fashion aren’t getting any money from your sister now owning the shoes. I’m fact some vegans even encourage thrifting leather boots so as not to waste the life that was given for the item. 

Listen, I get it. When my grandfather died, my sister got all the heirlooms and I got nothing. Because she’s in the military, she got all his medals and badges and propaganda leaflets from WWII because they felt she would appreciate it more. Despite the fact that I’m a huge history buff, and that as the older sister, I was the only one who actually knew our grandfather and had a relationship with him. 

You were mad that you didn’t get the things you wanted and you tried something under handed to sabotage your sister. That is a shitty thing to do. I communicated to my parents that I wanted some of the heirlooms that were given to my sister, and I finally got something. But you know what? Even if I didn’t get anything, at the end of the day, it’s just stuff. I love my sister more than any of the stuff I could have gotten. Ultimately, all that stuff will wither away and turn to dust, but my sister will be around long after those things decay.

She said there’s no way he enjoys it, you must be on him all the time to clean up. When I told her I never had to ask him, in fact he does most of the cleaning around the house, she was beside herself in shock. “He’s a real keeper!” she said, when in reality he ended up not being a keeper. Doing the bare minimum isn’t husband material. 

My dad was a stay at home dad for a number of years in my childhood, and then he worked from home most of the time, so it was normal for me to see a man doing housework. He was the one picking me up from school, cooking dinner for mom, and packing my lunches for the next day.

I told him that I find playful teasing to be a fun way to bond with people, like I do with my family, and that I like when I can have some back and forth banter with someone. 

He lit up and seemed extremely relieved. And he started teasing me back. It was really sweet.

Every time I hear them talk about the rules of their relationship and the day to day work they do, it seems fricken exhausting. No relationship should be that much damn work.

They conflate being tolerant with being approving. And they think that the reason women are against these things is because they’re Puritan or prudes or jealous or any other number of insults. 

I for one don’t think less of women who have lots of sex, either from one night stands or from getting paid. But I do worry about them. That behaviour is high risk, is emotionally unfulfilling, can be degrading, and becomes a black mark on your reputation. 

Sex isn’t meant to be mutual masturbation, it is an extremely intimate bonding experience. It is biologically difficult to unpair with someone who you have had sex with, otherwise so many women wouldn’t be putting up with asshole men. 

When I see a woman like this, I worry for her. Everyone has their vice, and it doesn’t mean they’re a bad person, it just means we have different unhealthy coping mechanisms. And that’s how I see this. As an unhealthy coping mechanism. Giving yourself to men who dehumanize “promiscuous” women and use them. For what? Money? His approval?

Now I’m not trying to knock our education system, but unfortunately I think one of the bi-products of our culture is that being highly educated has more prestige. But school isn’t for everyone.

It just means that the educational system is biased towards teaching you the necessary skills to go to the next level of academia (unless you go to a vocational school). And it only caters to one learning style, because it’s the easiest way to teach several people at once. You are a peg that didn’t fit into the educational hole, but that has no bearing on your intelligence.

Your current job is real. Your dad didn’t hold your hand, he threw you into the bottom rung of the company, so that you can learn the ropes and prove yourself. You work a long day, in a high demand job. You’re learning more about hard work than most people will in their life, a skill that can hold educated people back. You are learning about technology from the tools of your trade. Eventually, you can work your way up and learn how to manage and how to operate a business. 

Your job is admirable, so don’t let anyone shame you otherwise."

AmItheAsshole,fi13xqg,t3_f5r74g,1582050121.0,"YTA- Yes, I believe if a woman decides to keep a child, the man can decide whether he wants to be a father. 

That being said, this hookup culture is going to keep producing family problems like these. Sex always comes with it the risk of pregnancy, and woman are disproportionately shamed for being promiscuous, where as men are shrugged off as just doing what guys do. 

The truth is, the responsibility of birth control is 50-50, consensual sex is 50-50, the DNA of that child is 50-50, therefore a raising of a child is supposed to be 50-50. 

Yes she made “the unilateral decision” to keep the child, but in fairness, there’s no way to compromise to please you both. You either keep the child, or not. 

Now you may well be within your right to leave behind your child, and that may be easier for you for your life plan, but in the real world, realize that you will be looked down upon for that decision. People generally don’t look favourably on someone abandoning their child, because it really wreaks havoc on a child’s self-esteem and development. 

She didn’t rape you, she didn’t steal your semen, you willingly had sex with her. And with sex, there always comes the risk of pregnancy. It’s not the child you wanted, but it’s the child you got, and most parents don’t decide when and how they have children."
cringe,fhzwndj,t3_f5ho7k,1582015164.0,"I feel sad for this guy. He probably lived his whole life as an outsider in his country. Even though he may not have been an atheist back then, the kind of mind to question religion in such a dogmatic place probably set him apart. However, it really shows his strength of character to make a public stand like that where its so dangerous to do so. I hope he’s happy where he is now, but it just goes to show that nothing ever changes in these countries when dissenters are either swiftly killed or imprisoned, or else they leave the country."
cringe,fhzw6ep,t3_f5ho7k,1582014517.0,"I don’t know why, but this kind of reminds me of this girl I sat beside in my world history class. She was so shocked and angry that we were learning about prehistoric history, and then learning indigenous creation story’s, she started crying, asked the teacher to stop, and when he said no, she left and dropped the course. I call it the “la la la la la I can’t hear you” method of not having your beliefs challenged."
gaming,fhvxjrq,t1_fhufyym,1581902727.0,"Yeah but those orbs are so much more valuable as healing orbs than damage orbs. I almost never put out damage orbs, because if my team is on the verge of death, I can put out an orb and heal the entire team substantially. Damage orbs are just for finishing people off who are running away."
depression,fhtrtqg,t3_f4ou2n,1581877427.0,"I know exactly what you mean. But I really think those people are well meaning. They’re coming at it from the perspective of “this person is unhappy with their life, and wants a way to change it. These things helped me in my life, so I’ll share it with them.” When in reality what a severely depressed person is thinking is “nothing in life matters. Everything is shallow and futile. Why should I bother to try if nothing matters?” 

That being said, it’s also important to remember that no person experiences depression in the same way. For example, I’m someone that people were shocked to find out I was depressed, because I can smile and laugh and make conversation, but privately I was thinking about killing myself every day. 

One of my friend’s reaction to depression was that he became short tempered and angry all the time, where as I would never dream of lashing out at my loved ones. 

People can also have different degrees of depression. So maybe the people that reach out DO have depression, it’s just not a brand of depression that you can relate to or understand. Which is fine, but it’s hard to know someone’s life story with such little information."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fhilivs,t1_fhhoj0u,1581627091.0,"I did the exact same thing with my ex. I had a key to his place, so sometimes I would go over a bit early and make him dinner or fold his laundry. One time, I even picked some wild flowers and put it in a glass for him. What was his response to all of this? He proceeded to be creeped out that I did nice things for him, and said I should stop doing that. Then when I stopped cooking and cleaning, he complained I didn’t help him out with stuff. Like wtf am I supposed to do? That’s the definition of mixed signals. Suffice to say, we are no longer together. I DON’T HAVE TIME FOR THIS BS."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fhfgvqt,t1_fhehwpo,1581543124.0,"Oof. I was being friendly to this one girl in my college class during the first week of school. She was from China, and I remember one day I was telling her where the gym was on campus, and describing all the equipment they had there. She goes “ooooh. I didn’t know you ran with all that fat!” and proceeded to poke my stomach like the fucking pilsbery dough boy. I was not amused. 

Funny thing is, our program director sent us an email at the beginning of the semester telling us that the Chinese exchange students felt isolated, and that no one was being welcoming to them. So I was going out of my way (along with other students I noticed) to talk to them despite them barely speaking English, but it didn’t last for more than a couple weeks. 

Even a friend of mine who spoke Chinese didn’t really want to talk to them because she said and I quote “I may speak their language, but we have literally nothing in common.” So I think if anything, it’s more of a class thing than a race thing, as I’ve seen people fresh from China who didn’t act that way."

I know, because I know quite a few. Sometimes, they get so caught up in keeping order in their little ecosystem, that sanity takes a backseat. My school banned bathroom breaks when some girls lit the woman’s bathroom on fire. Suffice to say, that rule didn’t last long.

When my grandfather died, in the last weeks before his death, he could only remember things from his life up to a certain point. He vaguely remembered his kids, and flat out didn’t remember any of his grandkids, and only talked about stuff that happened from his childhood. Rambled on for hours about getting in trouble with his parents.
