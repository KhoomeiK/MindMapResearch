AskReddit,eslg9xv,t3_c8843a,1562085145.0,"A fairly large drug bust happened right across the street. A mother of 5 was taken into custody, along with a black male wearing a full business suit. As well as a 17 year old who was the son of the mother. The black male was from Alberta, and this took place in Saskatchewan. A large amount of cocaine and two duffle bags of evidence was confiscated. They got evicted during the weekend.
Before the bust happened, a neighbouring mother would stroll her baby every 2 hours to catch the transit, making sure to stop by the busted house first."
