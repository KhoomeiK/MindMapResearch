I also never stated that I suffer from this disorder, so please don't consider me in that group of ""a lot of you.""  


Edit: Also yes, I know there is no cut and dry way to act with DID. I mean it isn't a happy disorder that should be posted about because it's cool. It isn't a fun thing to live with. It isn't this great quirky thing that should be talked about and posted all over social media."
