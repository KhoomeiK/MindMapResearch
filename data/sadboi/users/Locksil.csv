These crazy kids attached razors and throw rocks at them and lit them on fire and all sorts of shit. Was so funny, couldnt ever find it."

His tongue started flicking in and out of his mouth after they injected him with the deading stuff, and my sister and I couldnt stop laughing. Our little brother was crying and hitting us saying it was not funny but we just couldn't stop. I loved that cat but laughed at him dying. Also laughed at my uncles funeral because my dad was crying and I never saw it before, didnt know how to react and when Im uncomfortable, I laugh."

AskReddit,fod8hwm,t3_g6ko08,1587681598.0,"Escort here. I met a multi-millionare who was 40 years older than I, at one of the nicest hotels in the city. We were sitting at this rooftop bar next to a group of businessmen who couldn't stop staring and a group of younger women who wouldnt stop snickering about it. I personally enjoyed the attention and didn't let it bother me. Then we went down to his room, and he made out with me on the elevator and I thinking wow ok old man you got some moves! But I remember just slamming my whiskey on the rocks, one after another bc I couldnt believe I was about to fuck this old man for money. He was in good shape though, full head of hair, attractive face.  It could have been a lot worse. The next morning I woke up in a pool of red vomit and no recollection of the sex was or how the night ended. My client had left me a note saying there $1000 in my wallet (double of what we originally agreed on so he must have really enjoyed himself or something bad happened, like why was there bloody vomit?) and that he would contact me again. I drove home and that was that, no going back to normal life. Entertaining rich old men for money became my true calling in life."

BPD,fn07l6n,t3_fyh7we,1586536869.0,"I feel this too, thanks for putting it so well into words. But i think its important to remind ourselves in those moments, that we arent seeing the whole picture. Its a snapshot of their relationship, we don't know if its always smiles and laughs. We don't know if its a healthy rewarding relationship. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Who knows. Maybe their relationships ends 1 month after you see them or maybe in 1 month you make a new friend. Who knows. You have had your own moments too that your brain is not crediting, moments people could have been looking at you thinking the same things you are. Catch yourself making assumptions, challenge it, and move on."

AskReddit,ex4zv7l,t3_crc4n7,1566014047.0,"I was dancing at a bar, a little tipsy, to a song I didnt even like, something by Cardi B. I wound up faceplanting and smashiing my nose into my face, and bled all over innocent bystanders and then continued to drink. I remember nothing else about this night but I woke up in a town half an hour away from the bar, my car. Oh and I was naked.
So anyway, my nose was fractured in multiple places and to give a visual, it had the shape of a crescent moon, I also had a concussion coupled with a relentless hangover, and a black eye tbat lasted a week. I had to get surgery to breathe out of my nose agaim and wound up getting fired from my job for calling in for that surgery. And i blame Cardi B.

Tldr; dancing + booze + me = deformed nose"
