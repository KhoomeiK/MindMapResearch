They sell gentle Laxatives as a medication for betta bloat and j was wondering if I should get it or if that’s just unnecessary because it’s only been like this since this morning?
bettafish,foxjqed,t1_foxjmw1,1588146159.0,Yeah I’m not sure about live food because he is literally the most passive fish in the world 🤦🏼‍♀️ I tried the mirror thing and he swam away (bless). Thank you so much for the recommendation

bettafish,foxbivg,t1_foxb7fp,1588139102.0,"So his tank is 10L (2.6gallons) but I’m saving up for a 38L (10gallons) 
Has a heater and filter 
The temperature sits around 22-24 c 
Water changes every week, about 1/4 of the tank every week 
2 lil sucker fish
He gets fed twice a day with generic betta food because the blood worms threw out his nitrate and ammonia levels. However I’m thinking of moving to liquid brine shrimp. 
He has two silk plants bc I don’t want him to cut his fins,  a thermometer, lil rocks and a hiding place that looks like a pot and isn’t sharp."

There’s a time and a place for excessive pda and i get that when you’re in a really lovey passionate relationship you always want to be affectionate with each other but you do need to learn to respect when is the right time. I think especially if it’s impacting time with the group then you’re not in the wrong here really at all. I think you might need to be prepared though because it could be interpreted as disguised homophobia? I hope you guys work it out
