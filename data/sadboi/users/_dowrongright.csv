Fun ones: Me and like 6 other kids were all performing in/helping with the talent show. Well the talent show was on 4/20, so obviously we had to ditch last period to get high before. The community college is right across the street and there were lots of unmanned areas. Someone snitched and we were let off with a warning. My best friends at the time got first place. Stoned. Absolute mad lads. 

Another one was another weed/smoking at the college related incident, we were all getting blitzed and whoever was supposed to be lookout fucked up. A security guard walked up and I had to shove the pipe down my pants (I’m a girl, so it was awkward looking) before he said “smells interesting over here. You guys go to [high school]?” We all booked it. He caught none of us. 

Another one was that we all had one gym teacher named Mr. Chase, but we all called him lefty. Because he only had one testicle. It spans all the way back to when my sister was in high school almost ten years before me. Allegedly he “popped” it due to something about a pencil in his pocket. 

In my civics class, me and some other chick were ragging on the Bible and how it’s mostly complete bullshit that was invented so some rich dudes could get more rich. And then some kid (quiet, bullied, very pro-Trump) stared at us and said “OKAY, THAT’S IT. I’m gonna show you what it’s really about.” Broke eye contact, reached into his backpack. Me and that chick looked at eachother and she yelled “SOMEONE FUCKING STOP HIM!” 
No one stopped him (probably preemptive bystander syndrome) and all he pulls out is a bible. You could literally feel the weight lift off of the room. I did appreciate my civics teacher who let us say what we wanted. All he did was guide us and tell us to calm down if we got too heated."

It turns out that her husband and my stepdad (who I’m way closer with than my real dad) had been stabbed to death defending his home in Oregon from a home invasion. He had moved to Oregon for recovery but visited us often, the last time being about a month before this went down. I had just texted him a few days before as well. I told my choir teacher what had happened and she basically told me to suck it up and that I made a commitment. I told her to step off. 

Needless to say I got drunk instead of singing on live television that year."
AskReddit,f4pas2r,t3_dl7n86,1571721903.0,"I had a crush on this dude for 5 years. He kissed me one night at a show and then said he didn’t mean it the next day so I was kinda bummed. Maybe a month or two later, we ended up secretly running off and making out at every party. Then I was drunk enough at my birthday show, he was alone in the kitchen... and so I walked up to him and I said “So here’s the deal pal. I think you’re great and I think we’d be great together. If you don’t, then you’re a dumbass.” and laid one on him. He later told me that he had been interested in me for about 2 years and didn’t do anything about it! He also said that if I didn’t do that that night we wouldnt have ever gotten together. 
We’ve been going strong for almost a year. Gang shit. Point is, YOLO! GO FOR IT! The worst they say is no. But you’ve gained a kick ass friend."
