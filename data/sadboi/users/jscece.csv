 The 1st I could see everything they were doing. The surgeon was teaching a student. When they figure out i was awake, they put me back under. 

The second time I was wheeled in the operating room they had music playing. So again i woke up (as usual lol) and i remember i  couldn‚Äôt move. But I just wanted to tell them to play some AC/DC.
