Who forced the democratic voter base to choose a rapist over 10 non rapists? You guys are nothing but hypocrites. How many women did Kavanaugh ""rape""? Why msm is not giving Biden's case even 1% of the coverage they gave Kavanaugh? You bunch of mindless sheeps don't have any morals or ideologies. All you people know is to lick up whatever msm spits. You'll keep electing neoliberal shills."

The last few months have been the worst phase of my life. I'm a the absolute fucking bottom. I'm very confident that hanging is the way I'm going to go. Next time, I'll attempt in the day (after having a good night's sleep) to make sure I don't have the urge to go to sleep. 
There's not a moment in my life without me regretting the fact that I failed to take that last step 10 fucking times. I so wish I had the courage to kill myself."
