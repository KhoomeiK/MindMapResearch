AskReddit,f0pxor5,t3_d5ye2u,1568849913.0,I was starting a new job at a music venue behind the bar. The supervisor held out his fist towards me and I proceeded to fist bump him. He then turned his hand over and revealed he was trying to give me some ear plugs. He didn't even laugh. Just straight up ignored what if done.

TallGirls,euel0tl,t3_cfvtp2,1563747022.0,Wow congrats!! I'm 25 and 6'1 and only started wearing heels last month and it really does boost confidence. When I was 16 my friends told me off for wearing heels one time because I was 'tall enough and made them look shorter' but looking back now I can see that I probably rocked those heels and they were probably jealous
TallGirls,ets965g,t1_etrey11,1563139618.0,I feel like when I'm at a gig me and all the other tall people kinda acknowledge each other. Maybe through awkward eye contact or a simple head nod lol
TallGirls,ets8xhj,t1_etrgw8t,1563139448.0,I'm sorry that happened to you. I once had an old man stop me in the street just to tell me how my fringe made my face look ugly. I think sometimes people are jealous and want to bring you down for their own satisfaction
TallGirls,etr5t9c,t1_etr3w04,1563113108.0,"Lol I don't take it as offensive just a bit odd when random people come up to me and comment on my height straight away. Starting a conversation with someone you might find attractive is never easy but a simple hello seems to be the better option rather than immediately going in with pointing out a physical feature of the person. 

Also not everyone who comments on height is attracted to the person. Most of the time it's just people being a bit nosey or making passing comments. It always catches me off guard and make me think that surely there's better ways to introduce yourself than just making a statement on my height. I'm sure it would catch most people off guard if I went up to them and stated that they are of average height."
