internetparents,fovzro0,t3_g9icpr,1588110403.0,"New socks and new undergarments everytime you dress. You wash them every time you wear. You should have at least 14 pairs of each.

Things like t shirts and jeans should be washed every couple of wears, or if you get a stain or they smell, then they immediately go into the hamper.

Dress clothes are normally dry-cleaned and for those it is best to follow the tag instructions.

Shoes, hats, jackets aren't as washed as often as everything else. That's also an ""as needed"" type thing.

Depending on how many clothes you currently have, you wanna do your laundry once a week or once every two weeks. I never use fabric softener, but I use scent boosters in the washer and a dryer sheet in the dryer. Always check the lint tray on the dryer. I don't really dry anything I wear outdoors, I usually hang dry them. You'll never have to worry much about color mixing if you only ever use cold water.

Since you care more about use than look in your fashion, I suggest Old Navy. There clothes are less trendy and more about the basics. You should have enough shirts, pants, underwear, and socks to last you through two weeks without rewearing everything."
