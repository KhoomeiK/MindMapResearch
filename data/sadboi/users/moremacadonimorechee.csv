The others will peck at me as if they're curious or saying hey but not actually bite. She also is the leader and when they were in the brooder, I thought I'd have to separate her bc she was being a bully but she calmed down a couple days later. I know when there isn't a roo, one hen will act as one. So not sure if maybe that's what she could be doing. But honestly, I don't want a hen that's going to constantly bite me. I handle all of the chickens at least two times a day. I pick them up, give them love, pet them, etc to make sure they're comfortable with me and they don't mind.

But when it happened to me, I asked him what it was and he just acted so chill about it while I was dying inside lol. He said not to worry, just slap on some abreeva and it'll go away in a week or two so I did just that. I'm not really concerned about what people may think pertaining to how I got the cold sore. Especially if they're a stranger but I will keep in mind not to share drinks with people anymore. I think that's maybe how my partner got his, he's always shared drinks and things with friends growing up and we've been together 7 years, I get a yearly std check and it's always clear.

AskWomen,fp9p4mi,t3_gc5yrm,1588431553.0,I did them a few times when I was in high school/college. I enjoyed it. Would do it again if given the chance probably. You have to understand there is a chance of having a bad trip. And I think it's important that you have a good mindset before trying it.
AskWomen,fp9oxp0,t3_gc7p38,1588431429.0,"Well that's weird in my opinion. Even if I were attracted to a guy and started following them, I wouldn't jump to liking every single picture. Maybe she's into you, maybe she's just trying to gain followers and want you to notice her. Idk, ask her lol"
CatAdvice,fp884e3,t3_gbs9y8,1588385904.0,"Normally when cats pee on things like clothes and furniture, they're trying to alert us that something is wrong. It very well could be stress but it could also be a medical issue like a UTI. Would be best to take it to the vet to rule that out first. If there is no medical issue, you can try cat attractant that you add to their litter box. 

But be sure to clean the pee spot thoroughly with urine cleaner or it'll just keep peeing in that spot."
AskWomenOver30,fp6zo5q,t1_fp6o7cc,1588361410.0,"Oh man, ystd I picked up a turd. The other day I saw this little knob that clearly belongs to the end of a shelf, cabinet, or chair on the island and I thought the cats got it and knocked it down the stairs to the basement. I picked it up and went to the kitchen where their was more light... it was a small turd."
Hair,fp6lufq,t1_fp6leeh,1588354562.0,"I still use it. There's an olive one now also but that made my hair feel dry. I don't notice a huge length growth anymore in my hair but that happens naturally with age. I think a lot of people thought their hair would become thicker but that's not possible.. so the rave died down. I just like how cheap it is, the smell isn't overpowering so it doesn't make my nose run (if my deodorant, hair products, face products smell too strong, my nose runs like crazy hahah) and my hair is very silky and smooth."

dating,fp609t9,t3_gbbt6k,1588343604.0,"Our first house had only window ac units in our bedroom and one in the living room but it did absolutely nothing. Coming home after work was dreadful. So many times, we would be slouched on the couch as if we were melting into it and joke about how it sucked but it was humbling us until we could buy a home with AC. We always wanted to cuddle on the couch, but it was just too dang hot. Idk, it's not that special to others but I just remember looking at my SO and seeing him look so sad but laughing about it, it warms my heart."
CatAdvice,fp5su5s,t3_gb6op6,1588339109.0,"My cat went blind around age 6 for some reason. Vet said it was probably just genetic. But he went deaf around 11 or so. We made sure to never move furniture around, we kept things away from the walls as best we could bc he used the walls to navigate. Food, water, and litter boxes remained in the same place. Instead of touching him every time he was napping, to avoid startling him, we would normally touch the couch and he'd feel that sensation and wake up. He had no issues with playing, aside from finding the toy when it got too far away. He seemed fine and happy. We moved houses when he was about 10. He adjusted very quickly to the new layout. I'd say within a week he was fine. It took some clapping and stomping to help him follow my lead."
AskWomen,fp5nols,t1_fp5n5vt,1588335359.0,"Think so? I made a post ystd about it because I was freaking out since we haven't been in a good place. He has always had commitment issues. Has tried breaking up so many times. But we did break up once like 5 years ago for a year. Thought it put things into perspective for him but I guess not. Feel like he isn't ever fully 100 percent committed for some reason like he's afraid of something, idk what. (Comes from a family where everyone has divorced 1-4 times) He's not a communicator so as soon as I asked why he asked the question, he shut me down. Then there was a lot of awkwardness and dancing around each other.... I can tell he's trying to bounce back into a normal routine but he comes off awkward still and I'm feeling really insecure."
AskWomen,fp5kcpt,t3_gbagj5,1588332442.0,"There was never really romance before, we just aren't those type of people. Things have gone downhill though. I'm working from home full time and he's going into the office on random days but still being paid full time. It's throwing off his sleep schedule. He asked a weird question the other day of what would happen to our house if we split. Because we are not married and bought a house together a year ago. It's been giving me anxiety since he's been a bit distant too."
JustNoSO,fp27xo6,t1_fp276n9,1588256922.0,Thank you💜
JustNoSO,fp27rsj,t1_fp26udv,1588256833.0,"So if he bought me out, I'd still be responsible for my half of the mortgage? I figured selling the house and splitting proceeds would be most fair. But didn't know which is less messy."
JustNoSO,fp24dhc,t1_fp23b2e,1588254899.0,"Thank you. I really appreciate it. 

For my new job, we had to take personality tests and mine was pretty much what you had listed above about your friend. It made me really sad bc I do see where I put others needs before mine and sometimes I feel like I'm drowning. A part of me wishes he would start the proceedings of breaking up and getting paper work started if he really wants to break up bc I don't even know where I'd begin or if I even would. I should talk to someone though about what could potentially happen though if his mindset is breaking up. Like how much should he buy me out for? Enough for me to get a down payment on a new home? Does that mean I no longer have to worry about the mortgage? Would it be best to sell the house and split 50/50? Bc he could buy me out, then turn around and sell the house and still make a profit with enough left over to buy a new home for like 100k. That doesn't seem fair but at the same time, less I have to deal with and I wouldn't have to stick around him as long while I'm trying to grieve the relationship and heal. 

This is tough. And maybe I'm over thinking it all. Maybe he was just asking a general question at a bad time. I have no idea."
JustNoSO,fp20pjw,t1_fp205es,1588252644.0,"I grew up with a narcissistic father figure. I think I overlook a lot of things with my SO bc I'm familiar with it. I know once I start reading books about it, I know the answer is that it does not get better and to leave. I'm not sure what keeps me with him. Half of me says it's better to move on, but the other half says stick it out bc when we have good times, it's great and I genuinely do enjoy his personality on good days. But they don't always last and that's tough. I feel anxious when he's not having a good day. And I know that isn't normal and I shouldn't live this way. Makes me question what's wrong with me."
CatAdvice,fp08h8m,t3_gai39r,1588204453.0,"If you want to change their litter to a different kind, do it in stages like you would changing their food. I've heard that if a cat plays with its water a lot, it probably wants moving fresh water. Some cats have a plastic allergy so if your new cat shows signs of a swollen lip and aren't sure why, maybe it's their food bowl (my two orange tabbies have this issue, they eat from a ceramic bowl now.) be aware of them pushing their head up against a wall and keeping it there for a long time. And as someone else mentioned, keeping their food elevated helps with preventing vomiting."

menstrualcups,fp02kw3,t3_gaip8t,1588201297.0,"Haven't had a baby, but when I first started using a cup, I was using the Diva model 1 and it would stick out no matter how many times I pushed it up. I had the same issue of it sliding out on its own. The cup was just too long. I use the peachlife mini now and it's perfect. I guess my cervix was too low and caused the diva cup to poke out. Maybe you need a shorter and wider cup?"

AskWomen,foyfgte,t3_ga91u3,1588171569.0,I knew I was not the right person for him. He just couldn't see it. Then he met someone who compliments him well and they're getting married soon. We are no longer friends due to her expressing she didn't feel comfortable with our friendship. So that sucks but I'm still happy for him.

Catloaf,foy10zt,t3_g9zhcz,1588162569.0,"These plastic bags make me nervous, the holes are so small and on a warm day, this could be a bit dangerous depending how long they're in it for. Just imagine how hot it is inside of that plastic bubble from the sun, and then imagine breathing through a small hole and having that much hair all over your body. There are other bags that are mostly mesh, they seem a bit safer. Don't always go for things that look cooler.

Edit- not hating on OP. Just want to point out that some bags are safer than others. Make sure the bag has enough breathing holes."
