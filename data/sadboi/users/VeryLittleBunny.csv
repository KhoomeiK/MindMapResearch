WritingPrompts,fp37z29,t1_fp37ryf,1588274672.0,"After a few hours, Mark came to. The room was also dreary and gloomy, the only light came from a lamp that sat on a counter next to a sink. There was no furniture except for the chair that Mark was in. 

Even though he had essentially been kidnapped by two people that he had trusted too quickly,  Mark only had one thing on his mind, his mother. Her surgery. Was she alive, was she dead? His stomach growled and he remembered that he hadn't eaten breakfast that morning, the pit in his stomach had been plaguing him for the past week, making him nauseated because he kept on worrying about his mother. 

Deciding to sleep his hunger away, Mark closed his eyes. He had no way to tell how much time had passed when he was awoken by a slap across the face. He lifted his gaze to meet two eyes that were exactly like his own. It was like he was looking at an older version of himself.

""Dad?"" Mark asked, confused as he was slapped across the face again. What was his father doing here? He hadn't seen his father in years, not since he was a child. It was already a miracle that he had recognized his dad, although the countless hours he had spent staring at photographs of his dad and mom from before they had given birth to him probably contributed to that.

""Do you know why you're here?"" his father asked. Mark was immediately reminded of an incident when he was a child. He had broken his father's prized trophy from college when he was showing their mother a dance he had learned at school. His father had asked the same question back then.

""No."" he answered. His father slapped him again. Mark looked at the eyes that mirrored his own and saw that they were bloodshot and glassy. Was his father drunk? He'd assumed that he had stopped drinking when alcohol had messed up his marriage.

""You are here because you have something I don't have."" he said. ""Money.""

""Why don't you have money?"" Mark asked, even though he knew all too well. The money his father had went to the same place that it always had, towards his bad habits. 

""I need you to give me access to your mother's bank account."" his father ordered.

""No."" Mark said stubbornly. That money was his mothers, it went towards her treatment, she had worked tirelessly to earn it, it would not be replaced by the substance that had torn his family apart. 

""She's nearly dead anyway! Mark, I need it."" his father begged him, the smell of the his breath overwhelming Mark and giving him a headache.

""No, you don't. And she's not nearly dead, she is going to survive and keep on living."" Mark said determinedly.

""Boy, you're in denial. You know that even if this surgery goes well, it'll only give her a few more months. "" his father said with a drunken laugh.

""I don't care."" Mark said as tears welled up in his eyes. ""If a few months is all we're going to get, then I'm going to take a chance for it. She told me that."" 

His father rolled his eyes.

""I'm going to get you to talk. If I can't do it, I have people who can."" his father threatened as he left the room, slamming the door on his way out. A few minutes later, the door opened again, and Junior stepped into the room.

Mark was ready to yell at the boy, but Junior put his finger to his lips and held up his hands in peace. He then took a pocket knife out of his pocket and started to destroy the zip ties tying Mark to the chair. 

""Get out of here."" Junior said as he pointed to the left side of the hallway. ""There's a fire escape over there. Then get a cab."" Junior said as he handed Mark a handful of dollar bills. ""Leave the city. Your dad won't be able to find you.""

""How do I know you're not tricking me? Whose side are you even on?"" Mark asked Junior. 

Junior grabbed Mark by his shoulders. 

""There is no protection program against these people."" he told Mark. ""I work with them. It's a lie we tell the people that we capture. What the bosses don't know is that I'm the one who helps people like you escape. I've done this 30 times. Go.""

Mark smiled in thanks at Junior and took off. He ran down the stairs and across the dead lawn and away from the building.

""We've got a runner!"" he heard someone shout. 

He heard grunts and a loud thud as the person who shouted was quieted. He didn't dare look back, he had to keep running, but he had a feeling that Junior had done it. 

Once he had gotten to a more crowded area, Mark hailed a cab and got in immediately.

""Where to?"" the driver asked.

And even though Mark knew that Junior had told him to get out of the city, he had something that he needed to do. 

""The hospital."" he told the driver. 

The car stopped in front of the hospital and Mark rushed inside.

""Gloria Asher."" he told the receptionist. ""I'm her son, Mark Asher."" 

""Third floor."" the receptionist told him, but he had already taken off, running into the elevator and jabbing his finger into the button. 

Once he arrived at the third floor, Mark ran to his mother's room and opened the door, out of breath.

""Hi, Mark."" she greeted him with a tired smile. Her skin looked papery and she looked weak, but her eyes were full of life.

""Hi, Mom."" he said as he walked over to her bedside and embraced her. And in that moment, even though his mother was at death's door, even though his angry and addicted father was most likely searching for him, even though he should've been in a taxi getting out of the city, Mark wanted to be nowhere else. Because for just one evanescent moment, everything felt right."

""I don't know you, I don't know them, I need to go."" Mark protested again. ""My mother is having an important surgery today, it's very risky, I need to be there in case-."" Mark began, but the man quieted him.

""Say nothing. They can't have power over you if they find you."" the man told him.

Mark pulled his arm away from the boy.

""You're crazy."" Mark said as he searched the man's face for any signs of alcohol or drug use. Was he mentally ill? Acting under the influence of a substance? And the boy. How did they know his name?

""Please, just let me get to the hospital, we can talk about this later."" Mark begged them.

""Don't bother."" the boy said. ""They'll be waiting for you there.""

""Who are they?"" Mark asked, exasperated. ""If you're going to talk about this group of people, might as well say their name.""

The boy shook his head with fear in his eyes.

""No one dares to speak their name. But they watch you, and others too."" he said.

""Why?"" Mark asked, facing the man.

""They watch to take revenge on those who have wronged them. A bit of a petty group of people if you ask me."" the man said.

""And who are you?"" Mark asked them.

""We and a few others work against them.  We warn people and get them away from these creeps. Kind of like the Witness Protection Program, just not as important."" the boy explained.

""Why are they watching me then?"" Mark asked.

""Well, have you wronged anyone?"" the man asked him.

""I don't think so."" Mark replied.

""Any exes? Old friends?"" the boy suggested.

""Nope. Still single, never had any friends."" Mark told them.

""That's just sad."" the boy commented before getting a slap on the back of the head from the man.

""What do you do for a living?"" the man queried.

""I'm an animator at a film studio."" Mark answered, not wanting to be specific about the whereabouts of the studio in question. ""Other than this, do you two do anything?""

""No."" the man answered.

""We should get out of here."" the boy said. ""They've probably realized something's up since you're not at the hospital.""

""But my mom-."" Mark started to object. The man shook his head.

""Let's go."" he said as he pushed Mark towards the boy. ""I'll go get the car.""

""I can't come with you guys."" Mark started to tell the boy. ""I have to go to the hospital, then I have to get to work, we're in the middle of a big project.""

""Don't sweat, you won't have to worry about that anymore."" the boy said.

""What do you mean I won't have to-."" Mark started.

""Name's Junior."" he said as he shook Mark's hand. ""Sorry for the lack of a formal introduction earlier.""

""It's fine."" Mark said uncomfortably as he shook Junior's hand, the questions in his head still swirling around like a tornado. The man pulled up in a silver car.

""Get in, before they catch up."" he said.

""Is there anyone taking care of my mom?"" Mark asked as he got into the car and fastened the seat belt. ""I mean, if I'm being watched, wouldn't she be too?""

""We can send someone."" Junior said as he took out a cell phone. The man grunted as he drove  in the direction that Mark had come earlier, past the crowd, past the subway station, all the way to an apartment complex. The building was made of brown colored bricks speckled with gray. It was an exceptionally ugly building, surrounded by dead trees and yellow grass. From one of the trees hung a tire swing.

The man grabbed Mark by the arm and dragged him through the lobby of the building to the elevator.

""You'll stay here until we find a better place. We keep all of the people we help here."" he told Mark as the three of them exited the elevator and walked to a door. Mark found the man's phrasing to be peculiar, like Junior's phrasing when he had told him about his responsibilities. He started to doubt that these two were who they claimed to be. Junior took a key out from his pocket and unlocked the door. The moment that the door opened, four men in black leaped out and tackled Mark to the ground and his last thought before everything went black was, I should've just gone to the hospital."
WritingPrompts,fp37p88,t3_gatogr,1588274537.0,"&#x200B;

Part 1 (Part 2 is in another comment because I went over 10,000 words)

The subway came to an abrupt stop as Mark was thrown forward. The doors quickly opened and the flood of new passengers collided with those trying to exit. In the fray, Mark caught sight of a man in a bright green shirt, a color that contrasted all of the dull grays, blacks, and too-bright whites of the train. On the middle of his shirt was the word ""You're,"" in bright red letters. 

  *What a strange shirt,* Mark thought to himself. *It's nowhere near the holiday season yet.*

At last, he was able to leave the subway and felt the rush of cool air on his face as he exited the station and the sights of the city took the place of the darkness of the subway station. Pigeons flew in large flocks towards a woman who sat on a bench, tossing crumbs of a sandwich that she had bought from a vendor nearby, people rushed every which way, only focusing on their destination and their own lives, nothing else. Mark remembered how fascinated he was when he first came to the city, how it was never dark, how it was always illuminated with some kind of light, whether that light was from the sun, the buildings, the cars, or the theater. That feeling had worn off as time went on, but Mark still found himself marveling at the small things that city dwellers tended to ignore regularly, like the graffiti that covered the walls of large buildings, all of the hustle and bustle, the buzz of noise that never ceased. Unlike the others who walked with their eyes ahead, only having tunnel vision on their destination, Mark's eyes wandered, landing on fast food trucks with fake-looking pictures, the pigeons, the homeless, whose desperate eyes met his own and left him with a twinge of guilt on his heart. As he continued on, his eyes landed on a dollar bill, crisp and new,  without a single crease marring its perfection. He picked it up, planning on giving it to a homeless teenager that he had just passed, when his eyes landed on a little word written in the same shade of red that he had seen on the man's shirt. Written on the bill was the word being. He shuddered. Two words, in a bright crimson, what kind of coincidence was this? Mark decided to hold onto the dollar bill, but fished out a coupon for a free pizza out of his pocket to give to the boy. The boy smiled at him in thanks and he went about his day, continuing down the sidewalk. His walking speed eventually slowed, the stretch of sidewalk ahead of him was crowded. Mark sighed, trying to go around the crowd, only to be splashed with water from a puddle as a cab zoomed by. He decided that he'd have to go through the crowd, and after about 20 ""excuse mes"" and ""pardons,"" he stumbled out of the crowd. 

*Why would so many people be gathered here?* he thought to himself. They were no where near the street of restaurants, or the residences of celebrities, those were all downtown. All of the people seemed to be looking up and snapping photos of something. Mark followed their gaze and saw what they were seeing, and his heart immediately dropped.

Planned graffiti was a common thing, well-known artists would paint stunning art on buildings. But this particular piece shook Mark. Why? It depicted men wearing fedoras without faces, holding cameras, ready to take photos. And looming over the men ominously was the word watched, painted in the same bright crimson as the words on the dollar and the shirt. 

This was strange. What were the odds of this? Maybe the artist had made up a fun scheme or something of the sort, but Mark didn't like shenanigans, he never had. They only lead to trouble, and he had no time for trouble, not with his mother in the hospital that he had been trying to get to all morning. 

With the sound of his heartbeat filling his ears, Mark ran, he ran all the way down the sidewalk, his eyes only focused on what was ahead of him, not the man from the subway, not the dollar in his pocket, not the graffiti behind him, he had to get to the hospital, he had to. 

""Hey!"" someone called. Mark ignored them. He kept on running. He heard footsteps behind him. It was unclear to him whether he was running to somewhere or from something. He had experienced his fair share of both.

Eventually, the person chasing him had caught up and grabbed his arms. Mark looked back to see the homeless teenager from earlier, who he had given the pizza coupon to. The boy was accompanied by the man from the subway.

""Hi, Mark."" the man introduced himself.

""I don't know who you are."" Mark told them as he took the dollar out of his pocket shoved it in the boy's hand, now knowing that he shouldn't have picked it up off the ground. ""I have to go, I don't really have time to-."" 

The boy grabbed his arm.

""They've been watching you."" the man said."

I have a list of happy memories with the people who left, and pages upon pages of depressing writing. When it was all written out, I was scared of how much it was. But it’s better to have those thoughts and feelings down on paper where you can revisit them every once in a while rather than having them constantly replay over and over again in your head.
