Ex_Foster,fqvxiyc,t1_fqvvmyj,1589687457.0,"A lot of foster parents go into this thing thinking that they are going to be superheroes and save a child from their horrible life. You need to take into consideration that you acting like the kid needs saving is going to make the kid feel shitty. Put the shoe on the other foot and think about how you would feel if you were a child and one day you are plucked from your home and put with strangers. Then, these strangers have expectations of you that you don’t understand. As an adult, I can see that the over eagerness comes from a good place, but it’s still off putting. As a child, it’s down right frightening. Be a safe person for your foster kids, but don’t go into it with expectations of them. 

Another thing that is kind of separate and kind of not, I just wish the adults in my life when I was in that situation knew that no matter where I was and no matter how objectively good the situation was, I never felt safe. The bed wasn’t safe, the room wasn’t safe, the people weren’t safe. Social workers and foster parents don’t always think about that. They think “oh, these are good people, you should feel safe with them” but how is a child supposed to know what your intentions are? I always went into these things assuming I was going to be hurt in some way."
Ex_Foster,fqvv5b2,t3_gl5xd1,1589685892.0,I can tell you have good intentions. You may want to spend some time reading and learning the experiences of FFY. I think a lot of foster parents go into it with the idea of saving kids and that isn’t necessarily healthy. Foster kids aren’t puppies.
adultsurvivors,fqvucd6,t3_gl2b14,1589685372.0,"Getting there? I still struggle a lot but over the last few years, I feel like I’m closer to being healthy. I noticed things started to improve after I started to process the sexual abuse I experienced and cut off contact with a family member who was part of the abuse. Also lots and lots and lots of therapy with a trauma counselor. There is no such thing as a straight upward path towards recovery. You improve a little and then sometimes you back step. It is okay to still struggle and it’s okay that you’re not “healed” from all the stuff you went through. I don’t think it’s fair for people who have experienced severe trauma to compare how they’re getting through life to someone who hasn’t dealt with it. Don’t focus on being 100% better. It’s not realistic and it’s okay to heal slowly over time"
