Another Asian acquaintance would also always try to bring up how much he says the n word to his friends other Asian people as like oh it just  means we are cool. Another absolving.

I have a limited budget is I just bought like one a month or something. Lol but they are so worth it!!!
makeuporganization,ey91ijn,t3_cw34us,1566933142.0,I bought these plastic nail polish holders off amazon. It‚Äôs a case with a handle and it holds 50 polishes it‚Äôs about 18 dollars. It‚Äôs a little expensive if you have tons of polish but it‚Äôs so convenient you can carry it anywhere and do your polish and it can fit in your closet etc so not to be taking up space or being cluttered.  I don‚Äôt have a link but just search nail polish organizer and it‚Äôs the one that looks like a a Case I think there are many brands but the one I got had almost 5 star reviews and it fits all my polishes sizes.

childfree,exhxk2l,t1_exhv6lu,1566316486.0,"Same. I‚Äôm on disability and I‚Äôve accepted that as my life for now,  but I feel like my parents feel like I‚Äôm a disappointment because every time I talk to them it‚Äôs hey you can do this as a career. And it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt work because of my illness! It makes me rage and feel super sad at the same time and I have to just not think I‚Äôm worthless and I‚Äôm okay even though I‚Äôm not some ‚Äúengineer ‚Äú computer specialist, dental assistant, etc etc etc, it makes me not want to go home for the holidays or even call them. All they care about is how they look. Like why are you talking about my life/career and what I should be doing with your dentist? Like calm the fuck down. I am glad I don‚Äôt live there, if i happen to fall on hard times I‚Äôd rather live in the street. And you know when they had a health scarce they expected me to drop everything and live with them to be a caretaker! Bitch what! I can barely take care of myself.. I need a caretaker!"

I had a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù treat me like their own personal therapist but didn‚Äôt really care about me when I had to vent or even share good things about myself. Like oh hey remember when I said blah blah blah.. oh no I forgot. Bitch you seem to forget every time I say personal things. I unfriend you! . I am not your personal yes person. It took me years to realize this. I‚Äôm so dumb! Lol I‚Äôm super wary now. I‚Äôm a person too! I blame these tropes!

Naturalhair,euqpxv9,t3_ch4xw6,1563983308.0,"awesome hair! tips: buy way more conditioner than shampoo, get a spray bottle,mist hair everyday/everyother day depending on your moisture level, and add leave-in conditoner/oil especially the ends, moisturize or it might get too dry/frizzy and break off. Get a diffuser if you want to define those curls / (do not use too heat(use cool), you will fry your hair) after you wash the hair,maybe this might be a little extra for a dude, but your curls are real nice and people WILL compliment it if its all defined!  braid hair in sections at night so it wont get tangled as much. throw away all your tiny tooth combs. they are the devil! maybe just learn to detangle with just your fingers!"

MakeupRehab,eu83tyi,t3_cexm60,1563549118.0,"same, i feel i switch to one that at least is cheap and gets me out the house everyday. i like plants. they dont have to be expensive if you dont go and get expensive pots, etc. and i like to experiment and propagate things so that makes things way cheaper if you just get clippings from friends or neighbor.  usually i just recycle and diy a pot out of old garbage..and it gets me creative cause i sit and decorate the pot to look nice. i just like to stare at the plant and i ts growth and i think that helps my anxiety. i think anything that helps you slow down and reflect is a good ""replacement addiction"" as long as its not hurting your finances, health, etc."
Naturalhair,eu46mum,t1_eu3y58z,1563441168.0,"I put my shampoo in a small spray bottle with a little water and direct it on the scalp.
