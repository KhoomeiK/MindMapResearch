Leonbergers,f0wzxjg,t1_ez4p8fg,1569017761.0,"Hi! I haven't been on in awhile, so I totally missed this! Appreciate your response because it gave me the opportunity to do some research between training requirements for guide and psych dogs. Guide dogs are kind of in a different class.... I am a civilian with PTSD. The agencies that train service dogs are mostly for veterans or have an incredibly long wait list. Owner training is actually pretty common in the psychiatric service dog world since there are so many different tasks the dog might need to do. Since I am going to be using the pup for psychiatric work as well as mobility/bracing, a large dog is super important.... Not practical, but a leonberger doing deep pressure therapy to calm an anxiety attack would be more effective than a golden retriever doing the same job."
service_dogs,ewvqtlx,t3_cqelvw,1565812023.0,No no no no. A puppy that young will not have all the shots necessary to protect them. I say you definitely shouldn't

service_dogs,eruuclf,t1_erukozl,1561297622.0,"I have to be completely honest... I am so guilty of judging by the size of the service dog. I never say anything, but it always pops up in my mind ""is this a real service dog or a fake"". I appreciate your explanation and education on smaller service dogs :) I will definitely always correct myself if that thought comes up again, especially if the dog is not behaving poorly.

service_dogs,eru1aoc,t1_eru15ix,1561259739.0,"The concern I have is bonding I guess? I will probably sound stupid, but would my other dogs get upset I'm taking the service dog with me and not them?"
service_dogs,ertzihp,t1_ert3x5w,1561258104.0,"Well I have three dogs. Fluke (golden) was supposed to be a service dog, but washed out and I was so in love with him I couldn't bear to let him go. My husband and I rescued a malamute mix and then we rescued a golden retriever border collie mix. All dogs are very sweet, fairly neutral, and their only bad quality is barking when someone walks up to my front door. Fluke still does tasks for me occasionally and so do the other two.. I am going to try to owner train a service dog and use what I learn to apply to the other dogs so they're all on the same level obedience wise."
Leonbergers,erswrwx,t1_ersvmo3,1561226244.0,Those are some really good points! It would probably make more sense for a leo to be a therapy dog instead of a service dog.

ptsd,erkvt6l,t3_c2i119,1560972558.0,"I work a fairly large healthcare company that has a large HR presence. I disclosed on my new hire paperwork that I have a disability (PTSD) and also told Occupational Health about it when they were asking me questions when I was hired. I was doing fine for the first few months even though I was seated with my back to my office door because I was able to keep my office door closed or take a break when needed.... My productivity started going down at work because my PTSD symptoms started flaring up and I asked my supervisor to move me over three feet so my back was against the wall instead of the door... I had to tell my supervisor what was going on because she said no. Long story short.... HR ended up having to get involved because I emailed everyone under the sun regarding this and even then, it still not resolved...

&#x200B;

There are pros and cons to your employer knowing what is going on...... I feel like I have a HUGE target on my back. My advice is to know your rights and even though there is no formal HR, they are still required to follow the law. Ultimately however, you work there, know your employer, and have some inkling of how they will respond."
