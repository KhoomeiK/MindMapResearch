But I once heard this story about a mischievous chicken. This little chick was one of several babies to their mama hen. They always stayed close to her, because she warned them not to stray too far, that it‚Äôs dangerous to wander as you may find yourself lost in a terrible place. 

But one of the many chicks was very curious. This one did not fear the unknown, but felt it calling to it. Every day it tested the boundaries. It adventured farther every day until one day, it realized it was lost...
And that was the birth of the universe. 


Sometimes being alive feels pointless. Try to see yourself as the mischievous chicken, not afraid of death or life. Stay curious"
