Do you feel mentally ill? What does the label mean to you? How will your life change based on what diagnosis you currently fit the criteria for? That last part is important because what is clinically significant right now might not be clinically significant in six months or five years so please do not take a snapshot of mental health as the be-all end-all of your identity.

Also sometimes we will give a catchall diagnosis, such as “adjustment disorder” for the purposes of insurance and billing because we’re only allowed to bill for F codes not for G or Z codes. That being said sometimes it really is an adjustment disorder. There’s a lot of factors to it.
