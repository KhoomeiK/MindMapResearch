bipolar,f7adiro,t1_f7ad9ct,1573526564.0,Yeah. I worry that a PhD would be too much for me. It's a real worry.
bipolar,f7ac4tf,t3_dv3axj,1573525670.0,I've been on lithium a few years now. I have some hair loss. I found it was less bad with the extended release lithium. So that might be an option for you.
bipolar,f7ac17i,t1_f7abip3,1573525604.0,"Thanks! Depression really killed me during my MA, so I really worry about it with a PhD. I spent like 6 months in bed. Still finished on time, though."

But other times I miss being able to think FAST. I guess it's overall worth it. But I do feel a bit flat (I'm on lithium and risperidone)."
bipolar,f0gc9i0,t3_d4tq4i,1568597175.0,I'm the same. I think it's because I fell into unhealthy coping mechanisms when I was young and now it's just how it goes. It's hard to replace a habit.

bipolar,ey2ya2o,t3_cvahi2,1566750950.0,I guess.  I'm just so worried about this.  I'd rather just take my meds all at once.  But I never got the chance for explain that to the psychiatrist because she switched it when she phoned it in.
bipolar,ey2xr8b,t1_ey2xks2,1566750613.0,"Yeah.  My problem is I don't wake up at the same time every morning, and I need to take the meds at the same time.  I guess this is an excuse for good sleep habits, but still."

bipolar,eswugps,t1_esvg1n6,1562320905.0,"Yeah, my doctor said the bloodwork should be 12 hours from when I take it, so I've been doing exactly 12 hours.

bipolar,estihfg,t1_esti3x9,1562267947.0,"Yeah.  Maybe my levels will be normal again once I'm back in an air conditioned environment.  Thanks!  That makes me feel a bit better.  I guess they'll need to change my dose again once I'm not in constant hot weather, though.  That's a pain."
bipolar,esther2,t1_esth5u6,1562267410.0,"We've had a heat wave here the past few weeks and no air conditioning.  I've been drinking SO MUCH water, but maybe it isn't enough.  And for salt, I used to eat much more salt when I was depressed because I lived on fast food and chips.  Now I just eat a normal amount of salt."
bipolar,est5rjl,t1_est5396,1562262594.0,"Yeah, it is definitely helping me.  I need it.  I've been on it for years, but moving to Germany made things take a turn for the worse and suddenly my levels were too low and now too high. And I am an extremely compliant lithium patient.  I always take it at the same time, I drink lots of water, I get my bloodwork done, etc.  I just want my levels to be stable again so I can stop worrying.  It's really stressful."
bipolar,essw0tg,t1_essu83k,1562258539.0,Thanks!  It's just really scary and I'm sick of it.
bipolar,ess0pgm,t1_ess0f2a,1562242218.0,"My psych didn't say to skip a day, so I probably shouldn't.  And again, the lithium is probably keeping me sane.
Yeah.  I just want my levels to be stable.  I wonder if my problem is a difference between the German and Canadian brands.  I move home to Canada at the end of the month, so maybe that'll sort things out."
bipolar,esnxwy3,t3_c8gg28,1562154179.0,"Lithium is great!  I've recently had my dose adjusted and it's doing wonders.  I can function again, and my moods are manageable.  I can focus enough to read for fun again.  It's great!  Not too many side effects, just thirst and a bit of acne.  Not bad at all."

bipolar,esm8pw4,t1_esm8fr7,1562100436.0,Yeah.  My thesis is due in two weeks.  Then I move home.  Then i defend my thesis at my Canadian university (Germany was a study abroad thing).  Basically now would be a really bad time for my meds to be wrong.
bipolar,esm81f4,t1_esm7lzp,1562100068.0,"Thanks, that's helpful.  I'll note the changes.  It's complicated because I will also be doing major life things this month, like finishing my master's thesis and moving back to Canada after living in Germany for a year.  So some changes might be to do with things like that."
bipolar,esejpfo,t3_c752bp,1561901214.0,"When I was really depressed earlier this year, my psychiatrist looked at my lithium levels which turned out to not be in the theraputic range, they were just a little low.  She upped my dose to be in the theraputic range, and my depression got better in a few weeks."
bipolar,esejd9g,t3_c76gvy,1561900892.0,"I'm on lithium and it works great.  It controls my moods and makes me feel really stable.  I can focus on my schoolwork and I can focus enough to read for fun again.  No major side effects, just thirst.  Definitely insist on lithium."

bipolar,erey5bm,t1_erexyxd,1560795578.0,"Yeah, for now they've lowered my dose to 1000mg and I'm getting another blood test in two weeks.  I guess I just need to hope I'm properly in range then."
bipolar,erexub3,t1_erexpxf,1560795374.0,I drink lots of water.  But I've recently started eating healthier.  Maybe that impacted it?
bipolar,ercpgjc,t3_c1d0f8,1560718400.0,If I'm not too depressed then I find it beneficial.  When I'm too depressed then I can't meditate and don't find it helpful.
bipolar,er8gp61,t3_c0w3lh,1560604167.0,"My doctor has let me take naproxen for migraines before, even though you generally should avoid combining that with lithium.  Now I take rizatriptan for migraines, which I think also has an interaction with lithium, but it gets rid of the migraine.  I think I was given codeine after I had my wisdom teeth out, but I didn't take very many because it upset my stomach so much."

bipolar,eqr1gg3,t1_eqq73dp,1560242802.0,"Yeah.  I'm switching back to the instant once I move back home.  I don't think the ER works as well for me either, even now that my levels are right."
bipolar,eqjyym3,t3_byle07,1560113540.0,I had to switch to ER when I moved because doctors here don't prescribe the normal kind.  It messed with my levels and I don't think it works as well for me.
bipolar,eqebs8m,t3_by7e4p,1560001877.0,"It's been a game-changer for me.  I can focus again and get out of bed and overall live my life.  I have to drink a lot of water now, but that's okay.  I've had some weight gain and some acne, but that's alright.  My memory is worse now, but I can function.  It's a great drug once you're in the theraputic range."
bipolar,eqa16se,t1_eqa064x,1559922721.0,"Yeah.  I'm in Germany for a study abroad program for my master's.  I only have two months left in Germany, then I move home to Canada.  I actually had to fly home a few months ago to get my meds adjusted because I wasn't functioning and the doctors here wouldn't do anything about it. Fucking bipolar.  I'm doing better now, though."
bipolar,eq9w5v9,t1_eq9v3bk,1559919338.0,"Thanks!  Yeah, I was slowly losing weight last summer, but it all got thrown off when I moved to a different country and got depressed and started eating way too much fast food.  I just want to make a sustainable healthy change, and hopefully lose some weight.  I'm glad to hear lithium doesn't make weight loss impossible."

I'm on the lowest effective dose for me and I can't even imagine going back to the lower dose.  I will drink all the water in the world if I have to.  The problem is I'm living in Germany, and they don't believe in air conditioning here.  I'm from Canada, and the doctor who put me on this dose is in Canada.

That all seems chaotic. It sounds like your professors are fucking you over.  Depression is hard in and of itself, you don't need extra bullshit.  Is there someone you can talk to about all this who has the power to make shit happen?  You're definitely in a tough situation.  Anyway, I'd be happy to talk any time, if that helps at all.

I've found that really helps.  I also break down my tasks into smaller goals and tell myself which day I'll do which thing on.
