Favoritism is a given anywhere you go, but I witnessed and experienced a lot of harshness that returners would not have and absolutely did not get. Even the returners themselves tended to be more rude than first years. 

I wasn't overnight and YMCA but the days worked the same. Start Sunday morning with a meeting, two hour break every day ( GS we had one night off from 6-10 that we could leave the property for). So 22 hours a day of we include bedtime, which we do because if they need something, you're the one to do it. 

I didn't experience any firings, thankfully. Internationals talked about going home during really rough weeks. 

Camp is moderately culty, lol. But no one was like DIEHARD. Girl Scouts people, especially ones who have been in it since they were kids can be pretty intense about it."
