Private schools have been going the whole time with little disruption. Everyone is online and learning while the average public ed students loafs about. In a perfect world with infinite resources we would be able to help all students, but it makes no sense to me to deny the learning to the average student because there are some students who wouldn't learn.

Send them private to keep learning, keep them in public to hear more about equality and less about learning essential skills."
