You are seeing your desire to work on yourself through the lens of a relationship. Then you are experience confusion, as this belief conflicts with your knowledge that you probably do not need to ""work on yourself"" to find another.

Question whether you truly do want to work on yourself in order to find another partner, or whether you might actually just want to work on yourself in general. I suggest this because I was in this situation - I felt I was not being honest with myself by saying I needed to do a lot of ""work"" to get the right relationship, and when I looked inside and explored that feeling I discovered that I was being dishonest with myself; I actually wanted to work on myself **and not find another one** until I felt I had achieved life goals that have always been put on the backburner for relationships.

Funnily enough, once I began to tick off these life goals (I learned to play guitar, learned to speak French, I learned how to create 3D artworks and decorated my flat with them) I realized I was a long way from wanting another relationship. Until I am certain that this version of me is constant, and will be constant even if I shared my life with somebody else, I am not getting into another intimate situation."

The people who hate you for leaving Islam are **far, far** more dangerous to you than feminists. Yet you do not obsess over them.

The reason for this is simple; you are not trying to have sex with them. They can tell you that you're wrong, but you **know** that you are not. People harping on about a god you know does not exist cannot threaten your self-image.

But what the feminists are saying can. It can feel like a direct attack upon your prospect of having a sexual relationship with a woman. It is *threatening* to feel that women may think or act that way.

However, there is a deeper truth. In all likelihood, it suits you to see twitter feminists, which you know on some level are not representative, as somehow ""poisoning"" the female meme pool against men. It achieves your objective of giving you a reason to shy away from approaching women sexually. Feeling that your prospects are threatened by feminism gets you away from having to find out that the only threat is yourself, which is a much more terrifying prospect.

The anti-feminist communities like MRAs and the MGTOWs are literally religions dedicated to using feminism as an excuse to avoid the things they are afraid of. I think that if you really look at yourself with an unbiased, logical perspective you will see that this is at least partially your own motivation as well. It's particularly difficult for you, because your status as an ex-Muslim means you also have an objective to regard fairness and secularism, which means your desire to use feminism to avoid trying with women conflicts with your need to believe in movements of female empowerment."

2. Expecting her to immediately know her own feelings on the subject, even though the information is brand new and incredibly complex. Even if you tell her to ""think about it"", the poor woman is now trying to form emotions in the pressure cooker of you waiting for an answer.

AskMen,fr41hcn,t3_gmjjkm,1589872626.0,"So the main thing with weight loss is that your diet contributes significantly more than exercise.

In order to burn just 600 calories, you'd need to do *an hour of non-stop high-intensity aerobic exercise*. You'd have to repeat this around 6 times for every pound lost, which is a vast quantity of hard exercise by anybody's standard.

However, say you run a 1000 calorie daily deficit, you'd lose 1lb every 3 days even if you spent the entire 3 days sat on your couch.

This brings me on to the other point about weight loss - it is effectively only about the calorie deficit. This is entirely due to the laws of physics; the weight change of all systems that burn potential energy is a matter of calorie deficit. The exact same calculation that dictates a human being's weight loss calculates the weight loss of a car, and both are a matter of calorie deficit (of course, a car loses its weight from the potential energy stored in gasoline, whereas a human loses it from the potential energy stored in adipose tissue).

So you need to run a calorie deficit. If I were you, I would take this slow. I'd assign yourself three weeks. In the first week, eat a large but measured number of calories (say, 3000). The week after, reduce this to 2000 (around what a person would normally eat). Neither of these should require you to explicitly ""diet"", but they will give you practice controlling your eating.

In the final week, you want to drop down to the amount of calories you'll probably eat for the duration of the diet. If you are in the 5'6'' to 6'2'' height range and you're male, 1500 calories is not a bad number to aim for (this would constitute ""very rapid weight loss"" at your weight, but as long as it was nutritionally balanced you'd easily be able to reach your micro and macro nutrients without conscious effort). When I lost my weight, I actually went down to 1000 and followed a ""one meal a day"" diet. It's extremely difficult to design a single meal that is in excess of 1000 calories, and after two weeks of doing one meal a day I simply wasn't hungry during the day. This meant that every week, I was losing 2lbs, so of course every month I was losing 8 to 10lbs, and over about 4 months I went from ""obese"" to ""overweight"" and finally ""healthy BMI"".

There's a good chance your battle will be primarily psychological. If you are comforting yourself with food, you will need to accept that this isn't going to happen. The reason I advocate one meal a day is that one meal of 1000 calories can be made **very satisfying** from a taste perspective, but 3 meals of 333 calories are often 3 unsatisfying meals. Being satisfied with the smaller amount you are eating is, in my opinion, vital to dietary success. The human body craves regular sessions of ""things tasting good"". For me, one a day was more than sufficient to completely prevent my desire to eat fast food. But if I went three days eating unsatisfying food I would invariably need to eat something unhealthy just to experience some kind of food pleasure. You should plan for this."

Eevee is real-time, but it's real-time because it takes ""shortcuts"" with the laws of physics. The result looks very correct, but not *perfectly correct*. This sacrifice lets you have the advantage of real-time, but at the cost of absolute photorealism. 

Game engines are the same. They're real-time because they take shortcuts. The behaviour of light and objects in them is a good approximation of reality, but is actually a long-way off being there, even on the best systems.

Your CAD software trades both quality and rendering speed for a supreme advantage; close integration with the logic of the CAD system. The people who wrote it are not graphics people; they're CAD people. They're most likely engineers with fairly limited programming ability. Their graphics product integrates seamlessly with their CAD program because they built it, but for them to be able to do that it has to be relatively simple. CAD doesn't need advanced rendering, and to make the features of advanced game-like rendering engines work with it would be incredibly complex and probably take the programmers miles out of their comfort zone. It would also drastically increase the surface area for bugs which is often an unacceptable trade-off for people using CAD software. I can tell you that Unreal Engine and Blender invariably have a myriad of systems that exhibit crippling graphical bugs almost every time a new release is pushed out; for people using CAD software having bricked versions would be devastating, whereas driver updates are par-for-the-course when it comes to gamers.

Graphics programming is one of the most complex types of programming in existence. It's so complex that only people who directly require it invest in it. A company that makes its money selling CAD software is not ever going to pay the kind of money it would take to have graphics people like Rockstar Games, for example.

Your 3D CAD software is not based on a real-time rendering engine like that in games. In fact, most CAD software has a very rudimentary graphics engine that is not efficient and almost certainly cannot take advantage of the myriad of hardware-level features that gaming PCs and consoles have access to, even if it's technically housed on the same box.

If you want to see a poignant example of this, you can crack open 3D software like Blender. Blender has two rendering engines; one called Eevee which is real-time and can render scenes of quite incredible complexity on-the-fly much like a video game. But you can choose to switch to its Cycles rendering engine, which is not real time, and it can take *an entire day* to render the same scene.

That said, one place where lots of westerns fall down is the idea that you need to ""enjoy"" something to engage with it. Meditation is a skill, not a tool or medicine. It's a set of mental techniques that you slowly learn and then improve upon, which builds your ability to control your attention. The idea that this should be ""pleasurable"" and not ""work"" leads lots of people who have been pampered the distinctly western notion that you can live in a state of perpetual pleasure to disengage with the practice. It also leads the same types of people to try and learn by ""just winging it"" rather than putting in the effort of reading a book or following a course, because they're trying to access some magical ""pleasure tap"" that creates joy and removes stress, rather than seeing it as a skill that must be learned from people who have already mastered it.

You may find that if you accept the fact it is not meant to be pleasurable, and see it is a skill that you must improve upon a bit each day, you no longer find the hard work involved to be a deterrent."

I am surprised you feel this way; practically all stories involving the Klingon Empire from TNG onwards involve a heavy-element of inter-house conflict. Worf's entire storyline is about the downfall of the House of Mogh and the malign influence of the Duras house on the overall state of the Empire. The DS9 story arc in ""House of Quark"" is also exclusively about the underhand infighting between Klingon houses. 

Furthermore, the idea that uniting against an external threat (particularly the federation) galvanizes the Klingons was a firmly established feature of the Federation/Klingon conflict prior to the Dominion war.

Agile is not ""it's done when it's done"". Agile is ""we measure what we are doing and how fast we can do it so we can make sensible, realistic decisions to meet our deadlines"". 

The idea that Agile somehow doesn't commit to set deadlines comes from the idea that you set deadlines by naming dates, and not by measuring speed. 

Agile is like saying ""I need to be at point x by time y, so I'm going to measure my average velocity on the way so I know if I need to speed up or slow down"".

The alternative is more like ""I need to be at point x by time y, and not being there by time y isn't an option, so I won't look at my odometer in case it shows a speed that won't get be there by time y, and I'll be blaring my horn and screaming I'M GOING TO GET THERE ON TIME out of the window to give everyone certainty about the deadline""."
