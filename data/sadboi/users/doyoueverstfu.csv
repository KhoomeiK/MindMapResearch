One question: A lot of the volunteering I'm seeing now is remote, understandably. Do you think this could be just as useful as far as making connections?

I'm in New York, but thank you so much for your reply!"

Not sure about for allergies but it's worth a shot. I assume you wouldn't be getting wild nettle, so I'm not sure what the side effects could be. However my experience with it was no problems whatsoever."

Mine is even more than mild jealousy though, especially when my boyfriend is involved like if he also sees or knows the girl. I try to tell myself that someone else's attractiveness doesn't make me less attractive, it's not always a competition. It's so stupid that this takes up space in my thinking..."
