I grew up with my grandparents, and when I moved in I clicked with the neighbours from day one. They lost their child a few years before I moved in, so they always invited me over to play with his toys and spend weekends there helping out in the garden and just hanging out. I actually still have a key to their house!

My grandmother got cancer a few years ago and is living on borrowed time. She’s quite tired all the time and spends most days hooked up to tubes in her chair by the window. She used to be a botanist, so it’s especially tough during this time as she only wants to work in the garden and smell her flowers.

Seeing the situation we’re all in atm visits and such is strictly off the table, but my amazing neighbours found another way to cheer her up and show her support. They started to hang pots outside her window; first poinsettias for christmas then daffodils for easter and it just went from there. She gets a new pot of flowers about every 2 week with a smiley face on it. They make sure to hang them up while she’s resting and doesn’t notice so she’ll get a surprise during these boring and long days.

I do this the other way aswell; I only dig and ask about peoples works if I’m genuinely interested, and never buy anything JUST because they’re friends. I wouldn’t want anyone to buy from me just for that reason either, so.

Vardøger, also known as vardyvle or vardyger, is a spirit predecessor in Scandinavian folklore.

Stories typically include instances that are nearly déjà vu in substance, but in reverse, where a spirit with the subject's (in your case your husband’s) footsteps, voice, scent, or appearance and overall demeanor precedes them in a location or activity, resulting in witnesses believing they've seen or heard the actual person _before_ the person physically arrives.

This bears a subtle difference from a doppelgänger, with a less sinister connotation. A vardøger is seen as a ""souls warden"" - something nice and friendly. It appears to give you a heads up that the subject (your husband) is well and on his way. It goes under the spiritual category ""fylgje"" (English:  ""following"") which are kind spirits that follow you, like for example guardian spirits/angels or helping spirits.

There is no empirical evidence that prove their actual existence, but some have linked it to your brains ability to find and see patterns and connections that isn’t usually visible.

I am not very superstitious, but the vardøger is always a welcomed thing for me."

Here’s the comment in full if you’re interested (OP was asking for tips on fixing enlargened pores on and around nose):

It looks like sebaceous filaments to me. Oil cleansing should help in that case - I use a mixture of 35% jojoba, 25% vit e, 40% olive oil with some drops of tea tree oil, that I simply massage into my face for 10-15 minutes while bathing. It takes some experimenting to figure out how your skin reacts to the different oils/nutrients.

We are generally far more conscious of our own skin than others are, though. Please, keep that in mind.

SebDerm,fmthhrc,t3_fxaijs,1586372805.0,"I have the same. I frequent r/skincareaddicts to find tips and tricks, just search ""pores"" and you’ll find heaps of relevant posts!

I find that what works for pores in general works for ""sebderm pores"" aswell. I think it’s because sebum is a main factor for both.

My daily routine consists of splashing my face in a ACV dilution to remove the biofilm on my face. This makes my skin more receivable for the next steps. Then I rub a sebderm friendly oil on the targeted areas, as oil cleans oil. I do this for about 1 minute. After that I massage the same areas with a facewash for about 2 minutes. Twice a week I also use face masks.

I think your goal shouldn’t be to make your pores smaller necessarily, as that’s really difficult and will get you frustrated and disappointed, but to clean them frequently to make them less visible.

I’ve been doing this for a few months now and seen huge results already. Not lasting, of course, but it’s worth the five min routine :-) I frequently skip days if I can’t be bothered aswell, and it’s still working.

A lot of my family members suffer from mental illnesses like bipolar, so we’ve usually got alot on our plates!

I’m sorry that turned into a rant, but it feels so good to lay it all out! haha.

I think your tip is a good way to go forward, with asking her first and then to see how it goes. That will give her a chance to choose if she feels ready or not.

You’ve been great tonight helping me sort out my thoughts. I was unavle to sleep yesterday, but now my mind feels a little more at ease! Thanks alot for giving me your time and thoughts, you’re a true hverdagshelt!"

I feel like we’re quite similar, I am the only one in my family who doesn’t look at her like a hurt puppy. I know she would love to get this video if she didn’t have cancer which is why I’ve decided to go through with making it.

Today I woke up thinking maybe her seeing all her family and friends sharing memories and joyful things might pull her further down?  What specifically triggered this thought is the one clip I have showing my nephew dancing ""the grandma dance"". I suddenly started thinking of all the things she’ll miss out on as he grows up, and I don’t want her thoughts drifting in that direction.

I’m just really at a loss here, so any input would be helpful.

I am so sorry about your situation and am sending good thoughts your way. You seem like a strong and caring person, and I believe you’re doing everything you can to better with the situation given to you! x"

If the teabag is left in for too long it becomes bitter and honey won’t help the taste so you’ll just toss it - wasting the perfectly fine honey you added."
LifeProTips,fk3nuiv,t1_fk3nj3e,1583841072.0,"That’s not what I wrote, though.

I mean if your salad dressing is already wrong/bad the honey might not save it and you end up wasting it. If your tea is so over brewed it’s bitter asf the honey won’t help that either, and you probably won’t drink it.

I always taste my tea to see if it’s tasting good before I add anything else. Same with coffee, making sure it’s not too bitter/strong before adding milk or cinnamon."

Thanks for all your replies!"
aquarium,fk1rkde,t1_fk1fgj6,1583785441.0,"I’m gonna see if he eats tomorrow. He is still just hiding in the plants (at the bottom), only using his sidefins a tiny tiny bit. 

I just don’t want to get the others sick so thought it’s be good to take him out. I’ll head to the fish shop tomorrow and see what they recommend treatment wise! :-) 

What is levamasol?"
aquarium,fk1r5cs,t1_fk16yet,1583785205.0,"This is really helpful, and makes me feel alot better!

Arne was, unfortunately, my favourite fish. Named him after my grandad even. I’ll go out and get Arne III when the tank is treated!"
aquarium,fk1qu6f,t1_fk1fy6j,1583785035.0,"I feel like you’re blowing this out of proportions, haha.

I simply said they state they have no pests/parasites etc on their plants and fish - and neither me or people I know has had an issue with them before. And I think in a small, local shop it is possible to keep it safe, as they don’t have too many fiah in each tank, have the planta they sell secluded and test everything frequently.

I never even mentioned bacteria, which of course is a natural find in a fishtank..."
aquarium,fk12utk,t1_fk107qu,1583771294.0,"Good plan! I don’t know if they’re caught wild, but our shop has a very strict ""no parasites, no diseases"" policy on all their stuff. Then again, you can never be 110% sure, right?"

As I wrote in another comment: They have all been thriving for about four months now, and we haven’t put in any new plants/decor/fish in about two months which is why I just can’t figure out what’s happening here.

We did feed them live mosquito larvaes that our aquarium-shop recommended, so it might have come from there?"
