Their songs played on the radio constantly, and my school bus driver played the popular A.M. station when we were being good, and my memory of the Carpenters in inextricably woven in that memory of me, as an 11 year old, hearing her song about rainy days and Mondays, when I was experiencing a rainy day and Monday myself.

I was horrified to learn that she died of anorexia, a disorder normally associated with women who bank their esteem on their looks, rather than their talent, and Karen had tons of talent.  I don't know why she did this.

Anyway, I never cease to be perplexed by the whippersnappers who post here about mainstream bands of the 1970s but who have never heard of those bands who had top 40 hits whose songs almost made me kill myself as a teen if I heard that song one more time.  I hesitate to post it, but this is the song that I despised:  ""Billy, Don't Be A Hero.""  This piece of excrement was played on the radio over and over and over.  Oh, how I wish that I had some calming Carpenters' songs instead.

Anyway, my point is that it's different listening to music of the 1970s than listening to it now as a whippersnapper.   The 1970s had tons of bad music, but you're focusing on those whose footprint is still there."

Within 48 hours of getting the shot, I came down with the flu, which I'd never really had before.  It started with aches and body pains, and my scalp felt raw.  I lost all energy, and took to my bed.  I had young children at the time, but they had to fend for themselves as I could not attend to them.  My fever climbed.  I could not catch my breath when I breathed.  Eventually, my fever reached 104 and held for almost a week.  If I had had health insurance, I would have been hospitalized and put on oxygen, but I didn't have health insurance.  I was afraid that I might die, knowing of my grandfather who almost died during the 1918 Flu epidemic, so I got into my car, fever still raging, and went to the closest walk-in emergency care clinic, where the attendant physician told me that I had bacterial pneumonia caused by the flu.  He gave me antibiotics which he had on hand, since I was too poor to afford a prescription, and from then on I got better.

Like my grandfather who almost died in 1918, I have never contracted the flu since.  I have had a few flu shots since then, but these shots were later deemed to miss the prevalent flu strain at the time.  I am always careful to take my daily dose of Vitamin D, however, since there is strong research which suggests that it can help prevent the flu.

There were boxes everywhere, but my dad bought my mom a HUGE box of chocolates in honor of Valentine's Day.  She made that box last for weeks.  I remember her letting me have one piece of chocolate every day.  How sad I was when all the chocolates were gone!!"

It sounds like you're severely depressed and could use professional help.  Life really sucks sometimes, but at least  you've got a rope holding you back.  Never let go of that rope!"

Trufemcels,fg16g42,t3_evunmc,1580421668.0,"High school is a very, very small part of the life you will ultimately experience.  Just grit your teeth and try to get through it.  Regular adults don't make fun of people who are flat-chested.  You are slowly becoming one, but it seems like your ""friends"" aren't."
AskTruFemcels,fg15evu,t1_ffyy7jq,1580421095.0,"My feelings are the same.  I remember the rape case very vividly and it was my impression that he forced himself (but not in a violent, knife-against-the-throat kind of way) on a hotel employee who really didn't fully understand what was happening at the time due to his celebrity, which he took full advantage of.  At least he didn't knock out his wife in an elevator, or breed Pit Bulls for fighting, or do a magnitude of other things that other sports celebrities have done.  He did seem like a supportive father, and we will never know the regrets he had concerning the brief sexual encounter he initiated which was viewed as rape on the part of the woman involved.  What we do know is that this was not a pattern with him and may have arisen from previous encounters where the women were very willing, and he just mis-read cues in this particular instance."
AskTruFemcels,fg149mj,t3_evmbuh,1580420453.0,Absolutely.  One of the biggest reasons I'm FA is that I never found a man who could hold a candle to my father.
Trufemcels,ffs3iuw,t3_euw4m9,1580172237.0,"There are ugly people all over humanity, but somehow many of them find someone else to reproduce with, and have more ugly children.  As for me, I've never been terribly ugly, but men have been terrified of me most of my life, due to my tell-it-as-I-see-it philosophy, as well as my feminism at a time when most young women weren't feminists.  Looks do definitely matter when you're in high school, but the older one gets, the fewer ugly women you find who are not paired up.  My feeling is that women who don't have a lot in the looks department eventually pair up with men who are also unattractive, and these men are happy since these women are accommodating, not ""bitchy,"" or ""shrewish,"" etc.

Frugal,ffgw025,t3_etd9w0,1579916478.0,"Many states, like mine, don't have an Aldi.  Try to buy only what's on sale at your local grocery stores (Kroger, Safeway, etc.) and take advantage of online coupons.  Don't buy produce out of season.  Never buy food in bulk unless you're living somewhere geographically isolated like the wilds of Alaska where procuring food is a hardship, or unless your local Kroger is having an annual sale on butter at $1.49 a pound and you can buy a lot and store it in your freezer.  Staples like rice are never worth buying in bulk unless, like I said, you're geographically isolated and can't get to the store.  Pork seems to be really cheap right now due to the glut on the market, and don't ever pay more than $1.99/lb for boneless chicken breasts, which is the normal, everyday price at WalMart although it can be had cheaper at other grocery stores when they have a special.

Eating well should not be dictated by one's percentage of income, but rather by what you prefer to eat, and what keeps you healthy."
SuicideWatch,fe6biu7,t1_fe6an73,1578886225.0,"Please consider counseling if you can't deflect from suicidal thoughts after a few days.  Many women experience unwanted pregnancies and either choose to terminate or go on with the pregnancy.  I would urge you again to seek counseling.  If you kill yourself, not only are you putting an end to a baby who you wouldn't abort to your abhorrence of abortion, but also are creating untold grief to your family and the father of the pregnancy, who, by your account, seems to be pleased.

SuicideWatch,fe69my9,t3_enxsnj,1578884863.0,"You are extremely lucky to have a partner who is happy about this. Why, exactly, does this make you want to kill yourself?  Do you have a profession where this pregnancy is incompatible?  Is your boyfriend also autistic?  Forgive me, but I can't comprehend being against abortion but pro-suicide.

If you feel that you are truly incapable of being a competent mother to this child, and if you are so dead set against abortion as you say, know that there are many thousands of eager parents out there who will raise your child in a loving home.  Killing yourself is not the answer, however."

ForeverAloneWomen,faw39a3,t3_eaamk1,1576365345.0,"I have not shaved my legs in almost 3 years.  Since I'm old and of Northern European extraction, my leg hair and underarm hair is very sparse.  As a woman who came of age during the 1970s, shaving my last wisps of pubic hair is culturally repugnant, since bare vulvas were associated with pre-pubescent children.  Needless to say, you could only access porn through movie theaters when I was a teen, and all of the actresses had full bushes.  It's bad enough having to shave stuff which folks can see when we're in a bathing suit.  Why do we feel the need to shave what folks can't see??"

As yucky as it sounds, scrape the dead skin off with a clean fingernail, and then go wash off the dead skin from your hands. Wash between your toes throughly with soap, dry well, and then apply an anti-fungal agent made for athlete's foot. Make sure you're wearing clean socks every day, and change often if you have too.

Motherhood is one hell of a dance to sit out on, and today, there is no reason to sit out on the most fabulous of life's adventures.  As far as childbirth goes, you'll probably have an episiotomy anyway, which cuts the entrance of the vagina slightly to minimize internal vaginal tearing and maximize successful exit of the baby.  Too many people put too much emphasis on the physical act of sexual intercourse between a man and woman, when giving birth to a brand new human is really where it's at, which is the ultimate purpose of sex, isn't it?  You've just been lucky enough to live in an age which bypasses one of the major entanglements to human reproduction."
