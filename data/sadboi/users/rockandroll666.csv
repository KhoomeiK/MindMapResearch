This is what matters most. But you are correct that therapists think diagnosing someone as trans or allowing them to transition is easier and simpler than tackling multiple chronic mental health issues. If I were you, I‚Äôd calmly but assertively say that you‚Äôre sex is not negotiable just because you have self hate issues. I‚Äôd try to educate her on some gender critical concepts such as people having gender/sex/body dysphoria, but not needing to pretend to be the opposite sex in order to cope. Tbh I‚Äôd be pissed that these issues prompt asking the trans question, and have a lengthy discussion about it with any person. Because if she is bringing it up to you, you know she is doing it with other clients too. Other vulnerable mentally ill people who might not have the understanding and grip on reality that you do.

So I basically just look for myself except maybe some people are even better or where I am aiming for, so I‚Äôm into those people too. I realize however that from their point of view, I am similar but less than them in those ways they are better, so I can understand why they might reject me."

If a man is doing something you feel crosses your boundaries in a large enough way, it‚Äôs a sign he will just get worse. I‚Äôm in the same position. I am very picky and dismissive. I have little tolerance. In the past I was far too forgiving because I had lower self esteem and wouldn‚Äôt want to be judged harshly myself, but now I see that it‚Äôs not my problem if men are fucked up in some way. Let their therapists or friends support them in their efforts to improve. You shouldn‚Äôt use a dating partner especially a new dating partner as a dump for your problems and lack of self esteem. That goes for women too. I work on my own self esteem and issues and do not rely on others, including men, and they work on their issues and do not rely on others, women. 

That results in there being almost no men in my area who have any chance at my interest. When others say you are being too picky, it‚Äôs probably because they themselves settled. Due to the high volumes of shitty men, and decent men with shitty behavior, that leaves women forced to be alone, or to settle, or to keep searching. And most choose to settle. It is appealing of course, but after dating some true low life‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not about to settle for anything less than someone who fully matches my good energies, beliefs, and respect."

detrans,flj1s5e,t3_fp4m5p,1585196393.0,"Being autistic and perpetually gnc plus very sexual and other ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù type things made me not relate to being a woman at all. Rejecting femininity in every way and feeling alien in this world made me think it would be easier to be a male. Add on severe depression, ptsd, a d being suicidal and I had an identity crisis. Add on to that being led on by multiple gay men and falling in love with them and hating myself for not being attractive to them and that‚Äôs how I ended up being trans. I ended up detransitioning four years later when I realized that even after top surgery and hormones that I felt no better about myself, that I was actually getting worse, and that I didn‚Äôt need to pretend to be a man in order to be myself. I realized very clearly how my trauma and self hate causes me to desire an escape and a molding into a new person who I thought would be a better version of me, instead, i was actually a worse version, hating my body and sex, resenting my sexuality and reality. Realized it was a big charade and that I could be valid as a gnc woman, I just needed to practice some radical self love and acceptance. I used to cry about hating my genitals and stuff Now I am so happy just being a woman because I realize that my body is there for me, it‚Äôs healthy and normal. And I was never really supposed to be a man, or be trans, I just thought transition could help my depression and self hate. Instead, actual therapy, mindfulness, and self love have helped my depression and self esteem. I no longer am jealous of men or want to be a gay man because I realized that I am my body, I am my sex, I am my genitalia, and I wouldn‚Äôt be me without those things, and trying to be something else was unnatural and irrational. People think I‚Äôm a guy sometimes but I don‚Äôt care if they think I‚Äôm a man or a woman because I‚Äôm secure with my sex now, unlike in the past when I was extremely insecure and constantly worried about being masculine enough or passing or whatever. 
Short answer: I was trans because of mental illness trauma and identity confusion due to being autistic and a weird girl. And I stopped being trans because I put in the work in therapy and accepted myself for what I am; a weird mentally ill girl."

GenderCritical,flfhrk3,t3_fohmf7,1585106903.0,"It does feel very frustrating at times. Nobody bothers to actually read up and investigate the matters, so no one knows what they‚Äôre on about. They‚Äôre not thinking critically. But I assure you that there are tons of lgb, especially lesbians who fully agree with you. There are many Facebook groups, people on twitter, tumblr, etc. little groups of mutuals who keep each other sane. It‚Äôs harder in real life circles. I don‚Äôt keep my views hidden from anybody. The truth is that the reason people get angry with gender critical views is that they are scared that they are invalidated some how. They are insecure. It‚Äôs not your fault that they aren‚Äôt in a good place to think critically about it. Lots of people lose friends over that stuff. It‚Äôs probably best not to provoke your friends. But you can state your views in language that is less offensive to them, more neutral and rational. If you did bring it up, have a mature and genuine discussion. Don‚Äôt even bring up the term radical feminism. Most people agree with radfem beliefs to some extent but they get turned off at the associations with it. To say that you should be allowed to choose your sexual partners as a freedom of sexual choice, vs that you don‚Äôt think trans women are women is an example of how to remain more neutral. Of course, a lot of times the beliefs grow and you might get passionate about them. In general I will speak my mind and anyone in my life knows that. If they actually care about you they will respect your beliefs but you also must be open to their beliefs too. Tolerating them. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good to keep major secrets but it‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs a huge risk to fully state your beliefs. A lot of people get dumped by their friends. It‚Äôs due to their personal insecurities. ü§∑ the thing is that I have my own demons. I‚Äôm not going to placate anybody else‚Äôs in spite of mine. I do find that friends tend to be more rational and nuanced than random people online so if you do mention anything just be personal about it aka don‚Äôt state rhetoric just state how it effects you personally and they hopefully would understand enough just as you understand their position enough.

GenderCritical,fl5o23i,t3_fmqnqf,1584841394.0,"Non-binary doesn‚Äôt actually mean anything concrete. It‚Äôs basically an abstract way to say that you don‚Äôt like gender norms and are probably quirky. Therefore non binary people don‚Äôt face any discrimination except for well deserved joking about it online on occasion. However, there are some people who transition who ID as non-binary. So those people could potentially have some issues. They could have some mental health issues with gender dysphoria, but unless they actually transition they face no discrimination. Unless the ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù they mean is having to acknowledge that they‚Äôre either male or female on a legal form or some bullshit. Most of the time the ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù is just society being rational and not indulging their abstract feeling of the social construct of gender, or people refusing to use they/them pronouns, which isn‚Äôt discrimination, it‚Äôs (using he or she) is just social shorthand for describing men and women. I think non-binary identity is a joke. I understand the urge to try and get away from restrictive gender constructs, but pretending you are ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù besides male or female either ‚Äúinternally‚Äù or physically is absurd. Just be a non conforming male or female. That‚Äôs far more radical than pretending you don‚Äôt have a sex or that you are somehow enlightened by living ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù gender with meaningless abstract gender labels suited to fit every individual and which thus mean nothing outside of a cute nickname type of thing. ‚ÄúGenderstar‚Äù etc etc"

I think that regardless of the misogyny or sexism inherent in transition, it‚Äôs really just a pretty mentally unhealthy thing to do for anybody. To deny ones body is to deny both reality and ones self. You can‚Äôt separate the body and mind since the brain is part of the body. Thus, to pretend to be the opposite sex is to deny yourself, and reality. Denying reality is never a healthy thing to do. It‚Äôs irrational or straight up delusional. From a mental health perspective, it‚Äôs damaging to pretend to be something you aren‚Äôt, hate yourself own body, and surgically change it, or even desire to change it.

I‚Äôve received about 250 likes in two weeks. Seems low to me compared to my sister who has gotten 1000, but she‚Äôs also very pretty, younger and conventionally attractive. I‚Äôm very androgynous looking which I know is less of a mass appeal. I‚Äôve sent messages to maybe 30 guys. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs high or low, but I am picky so maybe lower than average. I‚Äôve matched with two guys and initiated the conversations."

antiwork,ffbg2yl,t1_ffb8msy,1579763733.0,"Thank you. And Don‚Äôt give in to the pressure to pick a major from your parents, they probably just want to make sure you aren‚Äôt going to waste their money and that you aren‚Äôt going to just fuck around and blow off school. At worst, you can also tell them a tentative major to appease them even if you aren‚Äôt officially declaring it. Good luck to you!"
antiwork,ffb86lj,t3_eso2ct,1579754654.0,"Well, most people feel the same way, I know I did at that age. I was so suicidal for years I never thought about the future. Most people don‚Äôt know what they really want to do. If they say they do they are likely to change their mind later on. So don‚Äôt feel weird about that. 

The first thing to do is to A LOT of self reflection. What clubs or activities did you do in your school years? As a kid? What are your hobbies or interests? What do you hate doing? What are your best subjects and worst subjects? You can cross out options easier than not to eliminate things. I eliminated math science and physical labor straight away and knew I wanted to avoid those. 

Next, take a variety of career and personality tests. The big five, enneagram, Myers Briggs, etc etc etc. Not only are they fun, but they can tell you things about yourself. If you consistently get labeled with a certain type of intelligence, be aware of that. Career inventories are cool because they will take your personality traits and interests and recommend specific fields jobs and majors based on them. More sophisticated tests will tell you specifics of those jobs, their requirements, the schooling needed, and average salaries. You can find a variety of these tests online, or maybe your school offers some too. Explore those. 

Then, try to eliminate different types of colleges. Theirs a regular university with liberal arts in which you will be required to take a breadth of courses in different areas. Those can be useful for when you want to try different things and see if you like them or not. Then there‚Äôs specific colleges for the arts or theater. Obviously those will be focused more on varying types of creativity and artistry and less on traditional liberal arts courses. Or maybe a trade school? Where they are less focused on arts or an overview of many traditional courses and focus on a very specific skill or labor. Usually those require fewer years in school to complete. Try to narrow it down to one of those types of colleges and you can then explore the programs of that type at various ones. 

Finally, keep these things in mind. The job you have now or get during school won‚Äôt be your job forever. Don‚Äôt feel pressured to stick with something you don‚Äôt care about just because you have experience or are familiar with it. Go in with an open mind and explore different areas to learn more while completing your requirements. Don‚Äôt declare any major right away even though you will be pressured to. Remain undecided for a year or two if need be. Most people change their major anyway once or twice. Also, try to network while you do it by getting friendly with various students clubs teachers internships etc so you have more opportunities in the future once you do graduate doing whatever. 

I wish I had done all these things at your age. But I was too depressed to care so I ended up going to the main liberal arts college by my home with no plans at all. After four years of being undecided and unhappy I finally realized I should have gone to art school right away, and I joined the art program at my college last semester. I‚Äôm going to be a few years late graduating but it‚Äôs well worth it to pursue my passions for a long term career in what I truly care about.

Also, it‚Äôs very hard to avoid the capitalist struggle of work. Just try to play the system when you can and maybe find an easy part time job on campus while you‚Äôre in school to get experience and make a little money. If you find the right career suited for your abilities, personality, education level, interests, and general needs, then it makes working for most of your life at least sometimes rewarding. Don‚Äôt forget to network and not burn bridges if you can too so that when you graduate with a degree you aren‚Äôt totally lost at what to do with it or where to work."
depression_memes,ff83h3l,t3_es54s7,1579664986.0,"Hiding pain is no help. It‚Äôs only convenient to employers to let their employees hide their pain so they don‚Äôt have to deal with it or acknowledge it. If I were you I‚Äôd have half a mind to stick up a piece of paper next to it with something like ‚Äúhiding pain is unhealthy, etc‚Äù cause that is bullshit"
GenderCritical,ff836qm,t3_es5anx,1579664771.0,I guess you could tell the semi truth that you got back together with your ex and just leave out the time frame if he asks you out.
autism,ff82ylp,t3_es5cre,1579664604.0,Probably just in your own world and not self aware. Honestly sometimes it‚Äôs better that way. When you are ignorant you are free from concern about others. When you aware of your differences and of being alone and weird and people not liking you it makes you really sad and feel bad.

RoleReversal,fepmun7,t1_fep7z68,1579324722.0,Yes I see what you mean. Perhaps docile is a preferable term to submissive then
RoleReversal,fep47w6,t1_feovc6u,1579311769.0,I don‚Äôt think passive equates to that. Passive means more likely to defer to your partner or let them make decisions. I don‚Äôt think it means effeminate and I don‚Äôt think it means inattentive either.
GenderCritical,feo76w3,t1_feo3l2x,1579296029.0,I‚Äôm autistic and have never felt kinship with my female peers. Additionally there aren‚Äôt many older female role models (mainstream)  for women with these views or women like me who are very non conforming. It‚Äôs been extremely refreshing to find the radfem community and the detrans community especially because many of them are also autistic and non conforming. But the best thing for me was finding a straight aligned radfem discord because sometimes it‚Äôs a little alienating online within the mostly lesbian radfems. So I‚Äôve found my niche and it‚Äôs really awesome to be able to talk to women who understand radfem issues but who also understand attraction to men and how to cope with that.
GenderCritical,feo6cs2,t3_eq696p,1579295748.0,"Yes I agree with you. Young children are being told online or even in sex education classes that being a woman or man is a feeling or based in outdated stereotypes. It‚Äôs disgusting. And young children are being confused greatly about themselves. Even older children are being confused. The younger kids have no reason to not believe what the adults say and they don‚Äôt have much of a grasp on what biology is or what gender is or what gender norms are so it makes sense that more kids are thinking they‚Äôre trans based on their abstract feelings about gender stuff. And the older kids teens and young adults are being told by propaganda constantly that gender identity is valid and that there are a million genders and that being trans is this totally normal healthy thing that is the path to being their true selves so of course they‚Äôre going to be likely to identify that way. Also I believe I read that either 40 or 60% of trans people are on the autism spectrum so that‚Äôs a clear sign of why right there. Autistic girls are very vulnerable to manipulation and feeling different, especially about gender. I know that I for one thought for a time that my non conforming behavior was a sign of being trans, when instead it was clearly explained by the autism. It‚Äôs very depressing that kids are being confused and that parents that try to be logical are being shut down by schools the media and even doctors. It‚Äôs a sad state of affair indeed. Also as you mentioned many of the girls are lesbians. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a stat on that but like all of the other detrans women I know are young lesbian or bisexual girls. The rate is clearly very high."
GenderCritical,femosp4,t3_epzpkw,1579265041.0,"Sadly you can never tell 100% if a man will be a decent person but I have found that just raising my standards much higher and refusing to settle at all is helpful. Basically refusing to date a man who isn‚Äôt openly a feminist, and even then you need to be careful. I know how you feel though. It‚Äôs shitty when every man in your life has let you down. But you are on the right track. Female friends are wonderful help. I never felt very connected to women until I found the radfem community. Specifically, detrans radfems. I joined many women‚Äôs groups online and regularly talk to them. I have friends across the country who all lift me up in the face of misogyny. I haven‚Äôt made any in real life yet and there aren‚Äôt any rad groups here unfortunately, but even online friends are so helpful. Every day I see their gender critical posts and personal posts and even just that is a lot of solidarity."
depression_memes,femgv70,t1_fem5rur,1579254858.0,Once weed is legalized widely I think shrooms should follow
RoleReversal,femgtg9,t1_fem5mp7,1579254788.0,I‚Äôd disagree. Submissive seems to have a much worse connotation
depression_memes,fem5dtl,t1_fem4z68,1579240347.0,Yeah shrooms cures depression for 4-6 hours but it doesn‚Äôt last. I tried TMS therapy and it made me worse. I‚Äôm really skeptical that any treatment would help but ketamine does sound potentially useful. I want mushrooms to be approved so I can micro dose them
autism,fem554q,t3_epstz8,1579240105.0,"That‚Äôs interesting, when I was 11 I was diagnosed with autism and not depression, even though I was becoming depressed.

antiwork,fem4tri,t1_fem3p73,1579239791.0,Advice from personal experience; don‚Äôt make big decisions when you‚Äôre suicidal.
RoleReversal,fem4mt2,t3_epti7b,1579239603.0,If you use the term submissive people are going to think sex. You should use the word passive instead to get across your personality accurately without triggering thoughts of sex.

Name: Laura 
Sex: female 
Sexuality: straight 
Location: Wisconsin 
Ok with long distance: No 
Type of relationship; monogamous partnership 
What appeals to me about role reversal: I‚Äôm a pretty dominant personality in general and also as a woman. I‚Äôm very masculine in my appearance and style and I am non conventional in all ways. I am not attracted at all to masculine men. I don‚Äôt like toxic masculinity. All the guys I like seen to be really gay... I like very funny, unique, sensitive, understanding, and sweet guys. A straight guy I like is someone like John Mulaney. He is a passive man but not a sissy type. He‚Äôs just a very kind and gentle guy who‚Äôs also hilarious and artistic. That‚Äôs the type I like. 

About me: I‚Äôm an art student interested in photography and digital art and design. I appreciate all the arts but especially comedy, writing, and fine arts. I am a very goofy and funny person with a dark sense of humor and I can find humor in pretty much everything. However, I‚Äôm also a very intellectual and critical person who likes to learn about and discuss important topics and ideas. I‚Äôm also pretty cynical at times, although I am also idealistic too. I have severe depression so things are complicated and weird a lot. I need someone who understands this, but I also want someone who is self aware and who is trying to better themselves and who has goals, even if they might be sad a lot too. I‚Äôm working a lot on my schooling, art, and personal growth. I would like a long term partnership with someone who could be my best friend and other half in everything. I don‚Äôt ever want kids, I hate religion, I like drugs, and I don‚Äôt fuck with conservatives or moderates. Idk why John Mulaney is such a perfect example of my type but again I do not like sports or fitness or any of that masculine shit... so like John Mulaney on that too. Another thing-I do like twinks a lot physically, but I am not interested in a very submissive man. I want someone a little more passive than me but more or less equal in every way. I‚Äôm also not into any sissy fetishes or the like. üò¨ felt I needed to disclaim that here. Oh yeah and I also love the 1980s and I love classic rock, pop, and new wave music. I am an old soul and eclectic and eccentric. 

Not expecting anything but gotta do it just cause I guess! I can send pics or chat in private messages if the occasion arises."
