This is what matters most. But you are correct that therapists think diagnosing someone as trans or allowing them to transition is easier and simpler than tackling multiple chronic mental health issues. If I were you, I’d calmly but assertively say that you’re sex is not negotiable just because you have self hate issues. I’d try to educate her on some gender critical concepts such as people having gender/sex/body dysphoria, but not needing to pretend to be the opposite sex in order to cope. Tbh I’d be pissed that these issues prompt asking the trans question, and have a lengthy discussion about it with any person. Because if she is bringing it up to you, you know she is doing it with other clients too. Other vulnerable mentally ill people who might not have the understanding and grip on reality that you do. It’s worth it to try and give her the GC view"

So I basically just look for myself except maybe some people are even better or where I am aiming for, so I’m into those people too. I realize however that from their point of view, I am similar but less than them in those ways they are better, so I can understand why they might reject me."

If a man is doing something you feel crosses your boundaries in a large enough way, it’s a sign he will just get worse. I’m in the same position. I am very picky and dismissive. I have little tolerance. In the past I was far too forgiving because I had lower self esteem and wouldn’t want to be judged harshly myself, but now I see that it’s not my problem if men are fucked up in some way. Let their therapists or friends support them in their efforts to improve. You shouldn’t use a dating partner especially a new dating partner as a dump for your problems and lack of self esteem. That goes for women too. I work on my own self esteem and issues and do not rely on others, including men, and they work on their issues and do not rely on others, women. 

That results in there being almost no men in my area who have any chance at my interest. When others say you are being too picky, it’s probably because they themselves settled. Due to the high volumes of shitty men, and decent men with shitty behavior, that leaves women forced to be alone, or to settle, or to keep searching. And most choose to settle. It is appealing of course, but after dating some true low life’s, I’m not about to settle for anything less than someone who fully matches my good energies, beliefs, and respect."

I have gone out with the camera on walks with a good distance away from everyone but people seemed more or less acting the same. I saw one person with a mask on but there were a lot of people in groups or even with their babies. There really wasn’t much to document because people seem to be ignoring a lot of the stay at home warnings. In my state you can go out for walks as long as you keep your distance, but that’s it. 
So I’d say try thinking of other creative ways to document it besides capturing it literally in photographs. You could set up a photo shoot in your house with items about the virus and make it more conceptual than photo journalistic"

detrans,flj1s5e,t3_fp4m5p,1585196393.0,"Being autistic and perpetually gnc plus very sexual and other “masculine” type things made me not relate to being a woman at all. Rejecting femininity in every way and feeling alien in this world made me think it would be easier to be a male. Add on severe depression, ptsd, a d being suicidal and I had an identity crisis. Add on to that being led on by multiple gay men and falling in love with them and hating myself for not being attractive to them and that’s how I ended up being trans. I ended up detransitioning four years later when I realized that even after top surgery and hormones that I felt no better about myself, that I was actually getting worse, and that I didn’t need to pretend to be a man in order to be myself. I realized very clearly how my trauma and self hate causes me to desire an escape and a molding into a new person who I thought would be a better version of me, instead, i was actually a worse version, hating my body and sex, resenting my sexuality and reality. Realized it was a big charade and that I could be valid as a gnc woman, I just needed to practice some radical self love and acceptance. I used to cry about hating my genitals and stuff Now I am so happy just being a woman because I realize that my body is there for me, it’s healthy and normal. And I was never really supposed to be a man, or be trans, I just thought transition could help my depression and self hate. Instead, actual therapy, mindfulness, and self love have helped my depression and self esteem. I no longer am jealous of men or want to be a gay man because I realized that I am my body, I am my sex, I am my genitalia, and I wouldn’t be me without those things, and trying to be something else was unnatural and irrational. People think I’m a guy sometimes but I don’t care if they think I’m a man or a woman because I’m secure with my sex now, unlike in the past when I was extremely insecure and constantly worried about being masculine enough or passing or whatever. 
Short answer: I was trans because of mental illness trauma and identity confusion due to being autistic and a weird girl. And I stopped being trans because I put in the work in therapy and accepted myself for what I am; a weird mentally ill girl."

GenderCritical,flfhrk3,t3_fohmf7,1585106903.0,"It does feel very frustrating at times. Nobody bothers to actually read up and investigate the matters, so no one knows what they’re on about. They’re not thinking critically. But I assure you that there are tons of lgb, especially lesbians who fully agree with you. There are many Facebook groups, people on twitter, tumblr, etc. little groups of mutuals who keep each other sane. It’s harder in real life circles. I don’t keep my views hidden from anybody. The truth is that the reason people get angry with gender critical views is that they are scared that they are invalidated some how. They are insecure. It’s not your fault that they aren’t in a good place to think critically about it. Lots of people lose friends over that stuff. It’s probably best not to provoke your friends. But you can state your views in language that is less offensive to them, more neutral and rational. If you did bring it up, have a mature and genuine discussion. Don’t even bring up the term radical feminism. Most people agree with radfem beliefs to some extent but they get turned off at the associations with it. To say that you should be allowed to choose your sexual partners as a freedom of sexual choice, vs that you don’t think trans women are women is an example of how to remain more neutral. Of course, a lot of times the beliefs grow and you might get passionate about them. In general I will speak my mind and anyone in my life knows that. If they actually care about you they will respect your beliefs but you also must be open to their beliefs too. Tolerating them. I don’t think it’s good to keep major secrets but it’s true that it’s a huge risk to fully state your beliefs. A lot of people get dumped by their friends. It’s due to their personal insecurities. 🤷 the thing is that I have my own demons. I’m not going to placate anybody else’s in spite of mine. I do find that friends tend to be more rational and nuanced than random people online so if you do mention anything just be personal about it aka don’t state rhetoric just state how it effects you personally and they hopefully would understand enough just as you understand their position enough. That is if you ever want to talk to them honestly about it."

GenderCritical,fl5o23i,t3_fmqnqf,1584841394.0,"Non-binary doesn’t actually mean anything concrete. It’s basically an abstract way to say that you don’t like gender norms and are probably quirky. Therefore non binary people don’t face any discrimination except for well deserved joking about it online on occasion. However, there are some people who transition who ID as non-binary. So those people could potentially have some issues. They could have some mental health issues with gender dysphoria, but unless they actually transition they face no discrimination. Unless the “discrimination” they mean is having to acknowledge that they’re either male or female on a legal form or some bullshit. Most of the time the “discrimination” is just society being rational and not indulging their abstract feeling of the social construct of gender, or people refusing to use they/them pronouns, which isn’t discrimination, it’s (using he or she) is just social shorthand for describing men and women. I think non-binary identity is a joke. I understand the urge to try and get away from restrictive gender constructs, but pretending you are “something else” besides male or female either “internally” or physically is absurd. Just be a non conforming male or female. That’s far more radical than pretending you don’t have a sex or that you are somehow enlightened by living “beyond” gender with meaningless abstract gender labels suited to fit every individual and which thus mean nothing outside of a cute nickname type of thing. “Genderstar” etc etc"

I’d say that it’s best to have a few rats at least two but maybe three just in case one dies and you don’t want the rat or yourself to be alone. I had them as emotional comfort pets and it was worth it even though they passed away far too soon. I’d say that it’s ideal to have other animals as well like a cat or dog too. Ideally I’d have my dog and some rats but right now I can only afford the dog. My dog is great but I miss having rats. They’re unique creatures and nothing really makes up for them. So I’d say if you’re very worried about it maybe having a longer living animal in your house as well to fall back on. But most people end up getting hooked on their two rats and then just buying more and more when the others die

But a young artist will have a young crowd that might get wild. There will probably be drinking and drugs around you so if you don’t want that try and sit away from the rowdy people.

He was a plastic surgeon who practiced trans stuff too. He was a very nice and caring guy, he did seem genuinely concerned about my mental health. But at the same time, it was quite irresponsible to perform that surgery on a healthy body. But the thing is that he did require two letters of recommendation  from doctors first, so he was trying to follow the accepted guidelines for trans patients. I feel like I can’t really blame the guy for trying to make money. I’d probably do the same if I thought I was following the proper guidelines. I feel much more angry at the many therapists who were unhelpful, the general practitioner who wrote one letter of recommendation who barely even knew me, and my psychiatrist who knew I was fucked up and suicidal and had all these issues and still deemed me stable enough to make a surgical decision like that. I feel like none of these doctors know what’s really going on and they’re all just listening to the transpoganda forcing everyone to just blindly validate it. Idk. Sometimes I think about contacting the surgeons office maybe anonymously and writing all this but I’m scared of being dismissed. And the general doctor too, I still see her. I feel I should say something. My former psychiatrist died so I can’t tell her but so far I just don’t feel comfortable doing it, or I haven’t had the opportunity to bring attention to it.

I think that regardless of the misogyny or sexism inherent in transition, it’s really just a pretty mentally unhealthy thing to do for anybody. To deny ones body is to deny both reality and ones self. You can’t separate the body and mind since the brain is part of the body. Thus, to pretend to be the opposite sex is to deny yourself, and reality. Denying reality is never a healthy thing to do. It’s irrational or straight up delusional. From a mental health perspective, it’s damaging to pretend to be something you aren’t, hate yourself own body, and surgically change it, or even desire to change it.

Possibly look up videos of people with doubts on YouTube and see if you relate or disagree with what they say. Sometimes the doubt will be relieved once you explore it and acknowledge it and where it comes from, sometimes it will grow larger and more fine tuned once you explore it.

antiwork,ffbg2yl,t1_ffb8msy,1579763733.0,"Thank you. And Don’t give in to the pressure to pick a major from your parents, they probably just want to make sure you aren’t going to waste their money and that you aren’t going to just fuck around and blow off school. At worst, you can also tell them a tentative major to appease them even if you aren’t officially declaring it. Good luck to you!"
antiwork,ffb86lj,t3_eso2ct,1579754654.0,"Well, most people feel the same way, I know I did at that age. I was so suicidal for years I never thought about the future. Most people don’t know what they really want to do. If they say they do they are likely to change their mind later on. So don’t feel weird about that. 

The first thing to do is to A LOT of self reflection. What clubs or activities did you do in your school years? As a kid? What are your hobbies or interests? What do you hate doing? What are your best subjects and worst subjects? You can cross out options easier than not to eliminate things. I eliminated math science and physical labor straight away and knew I wanted to avoid those. 

Next, take a variety of career and personality tests. The big five, enneagram, Myers Briggs, etc etc etc. Not only are they fun, but they can tell you things about yourself. If you consistently get labeled with a certain type of intelligence, be aware of that. Career inventories are cool because they will take your personality traits and interests and recommend specific fields jobs and majors based on them. More sophisticated tests will tell you specifics of those jobs, their requirements, the schooling needed, and average salaries. You can find a variety of these tests online, or maybe your school offers some too. Explore those. 

Then, try to eliminate different types of colleges. Theirs a regular university with liberal arts in which you will be required to take a breadth of courses in different areas. Those can be useful for when you want to try different things and see if you like them or not. Then there’s specific colleges for the arts or theater. Obviously those will be focused more on varying types of creativity and artistry and less on traditional liberal arts courses. Or maybe a trade school? Where they are less focused on arts or an overview of many traditional courses and focus on a very specific skill or labor. Usually those require fewer years in school to complete. Try to narrow it down to one of those types of colleges and you can then explore the programs of that type at various ones. 

Finally, keep these things in mind. The job you have now or get during school won’t be your job forever. Don’t feel pressured to stick with something you don’t care about just because you have experience or are familiar with it. Go in with an open mind and explore different areas to learn more while completing your requirements. Don’t declare any major right away even though you will be pressured to. Remain undecided for a year or two if need be. Most people change their major anyway once or twice. Also, try to network while you do it by getting friendly with various students clubs teachers internships etc so you have more opportunities in the future once you do graduate doing whatever. 

I wish I had done all these things at your age. But I was too depressed to care so I ended up going to the main liberal arts college by my home with no plans at all. After four years of being undecided and unhappy I finally realized I should have gone to art school right away, and I joined the art program at my college last semester. I’m going to be a few years late graduating but it’s well worth it to pursue my passions for a long term career in what I truly care about.

Also, it’s very hard to avoid the capitalist struggle of work. Just try to play the system when you can and maybe find an easy part time job on campus while you’re in school to get experience and make a little money. If you find the right career suited for your abilities, personality, education level, interests, and general needs, then it makes working for most of your life at least sometimes rewarding. Don’t forget to network and not burn bridges if you can too so that when you graduate with a degree you aren’t totally lost at what to do with it or where to work."
depression_memes,ff83h3l,t3_es54s7,1579664986.0,"Hiding pain is no help. It’s only convenient to employers to let their employees hide their pain so they don’t have to deal with it or acknowledge it. If I were you I’d have half a mind to stick up a piece of paper next to it with something like “hiding pain is unhealthy, etc” cause that is bullshit"
GenderCritical,ff836qm,t3_es5anx,1579664771.0,I guess you could tell the semi truth that you got back together with your ex and just leave out the time frame if he asks you out.
autism,ff82ylp,t3_es5cre,1579664604.0,Probably just in your own world and not self aware. Honestly sometimes it’s better that way. When you are ignorant you are free from concern about others. When you aware of your differences and of being alone and weird and people not liking you it makes you really sad and feel bad.
RATS,ff82ijw,t3_es5sqc,1579664278.0,Rest In Peace sweet boy 💕
RoleReversal,ff6sn1g,t1_ff6mi31,1579634045.0,You seem pathetic lol
RATS,fex6yqr,t3_equ4gc,1579425657.0,looks like Danny Elfman lol
RoleReversal,fepmun7,t1_fep7z68,1579324722.0,Yes I see what you mean. Perhaps docile is a preferable term to submissive then
RoleReversal,fep47w6,t1_feovc6u,1579311769.0,I don’t think passive equates to that. Passive means more likely to defer to your partner or let them make decisions. I don’t think it means effeminate and I don’t think it means inattentive either.
GenderCritical,feo76w3,t1_feo3l2x,1579296029.0,I’m autistic and have never felt kinship with my female peers. Additionally there aren’t many older female role models (mainstream)  for women with these views or women like me who are very non conforming. It’s been extremely refreshing to find the radfem community and the detrans community especially because many of them are also autistic and non conforming. But the best thing for me was finding a straight aligned radfem discord because sometimes it’s a little alienating online within the mostly lesbian radfems. So I’ve found my niche and it’s really awesome to be able to talk to women who understand radfem issues but who also understand attraction to men and how to cope with that.
GenderCritical,feo6cs2,t3_eq696p,1579295748.0,"Yes I agree with you. Young children are being told online or even in sex education classes that being a woman or man is a feeling or based in outdated stereotypes. It’s disgusting. And young children are being confused greatly about themselves. Even older children are being confused. The younger kids have no reason to not believe what the adults say and they don’t have much of a grasp on what biology is or what gender is or what gender norms are so it makes sense that more kids are thinking they’re trans based on their abstract feelings about gender stuff. And the older kids teens and young adults are being told by propaganda constantly that gender identity is valid and that there are a million genders and that being trans is this totally normal healthy thing that is the path to being their true selves so of course they’re going to be likely to identify that way. Also I believe I read that either 40 or 60% of trans people are on the autism spectrum so that’s a clear sign of why right there. Autistic girls are very vulnerable to manipulation and feeling different, especially about gender. I know that I for one thought for a time that my non conforming behavior was a sign of being trans, when instead it was clearly explained by the autism. It’s very depressing that kids are being confused and that parents that try to be logical are being shut down by schools the media and even doctors. It’s a sad state of affair indeed. Also as you mentioned many of the girls are lesbians. I don’t know if there’s a stat on that but like all of the other detrans women I know are young lesbian or bisexual girls. The rate is clearly very high."
GenderCritical,femosp4,t3_epzpkw,1579265041.0,"Sadly you can never tell 100% if a man will be a decent person but I have found that just raising my standards much higher and refusing to settle at all is helpful. Basically refusing to date a man who isn’t openly a feminist, and even then you need to be careful. I know how you feel though. It’s shitty when every man in your life has let you down. But you are on the right track. Female friends are wonderful help. I never felt very connected to women until I found the radfem community. Specifically, detrans radfems. I joined many women’s groups online and regularly talk to them. I have friends across the country who all lift me up in the face of misogyny. I haven’t made any in real life yet and there aren’t any rad groups here unfortunately, but even online friends are so helpful. Every day I see their gender critical posts and personal posts and even just that is a lot of solidarity."
depression_memes,femgv70,t1_fem5rur,1579254858.0,Once weed is legalized widely I think shrooms should follow
RoleReversal,femgtg9,t1_fem5mp7,1579254788.0,I’d disagree. Submissive seems to have a much worse connotation
depression_memes,fem5dtl,t1_fem4z68,1579240347.0,Yeah shrooms cures depression for 4-6 hours but it doesn’t last. I tried TMS therapy and it made me worse. I’m really skeptical that any treatment would help but ketamine does sound potentially useful. I want mushrooms to be approved so I can micro dose them
autism,fem554q,t3_epstz8,1579240105.0,"That’s interesting, when I was 11 I was diagnosed with autism and not depression, even though I was becoming depressed. They later diagnosed me with depression. I’m not sure why they couldn’t tell the difference. The traits really are not similar. Sounds you like you need a second opinion at a different clinic"
antiwork,fem4tri,t1_fem3p73,1579239791.0,Advice from personal experience; don’t make big decisions when you’re suicidal.
RoleReversal,fem4mt2,t3_epti7b,1579239603.0,If you use the term submissive people are going to think sex. You should use the word passive instead to get across your personality accurately without triggering thoughts of sex.
autism,fem46dz,t3_eputga,1579239163.0,You should practice talking to them online
depression_memes,fem436d,t3_epv02c,1579239076.0,“Cures”? Sure it does. I’m skeptical of any drug that cures anything.
antiwork,fem3lxt,t3_epvrxk,1579238632.0,What if you get better and change your mind and then you’re stuck with all those loans?
autism,fejiq85,t3_epi6jt,1579176005.0,"Stocking is good. I just started a job at Walgreens as a stocker and I haven’t worked in two years due to multiple issues. It’s pretty easy stuff, organization is fun, and you don’t have to talk that much. Sometimes the customers will ask me questions but mostly I’m on my own. You could stock overnight when no ones there or in a warehouse. But personally I think it’s good to have SOME social interaction. It helps with confidence"
itsafetish,fejikqm,t3_epiczr,1579175824.0,Well you have to be more specific. What do you agree with? What do you disagree with?
GenderCritical,feiw1vl,t1_feivq5b,1579148764.0,Why do you say that
GenderCritical,feiq1fa,t3_epd8y5,1579144362.0,One of the reasons I’m for Bernie over warren
Art,fee869l,t1_fedz6iv,1579028387.0,I’ve never seen it but I know that it’s a good show and I will eventually get to it!

RoleReversal,feczaom,t3_crg8jr,1578990908.0,"This thread still going? cause it looks really dead. Anyway I guess what the hell I’ll post something. 
Name: Laura 
Sex: female 
Sexuality: straight 
Location: Wisconsin 
Ok with long distance: No 
Type of relationship; monogamous partnership 
What appeals to me about role reversal: I’m a pretty dominant personality in general and also as a woman. I’m very masculine in my appearance and style and I am non conventional in all ways. I am not attracted at all to masculine men. I don’t like toxic masculinity. All the guys I like seen to be really gay... I like very funny, unique, sensitive, understanding, and sweet guys. A straight guy I like is someone like John Mulaney. He is a passive man but not a sissy type. He’s just a very kind and gentle guy who’s also hilarious and artistic. That’s the type I like. 

About me: I’m an art student interested in photography and digital art and design. I appreciate all the arts but especially comedy, writing, and fine arts. I am a very goofy and funny person with a dark sense of humor and I can find humor in pretty much everything. However, I’m also a very intellectual and critical person who likes to learn about and discuss important topics and ideas. I’m also pretty cynical at times, although I am also idealistic too. I have severe depression so things are complicated and weird a lot. I need someone who understands this, but I also want someone who is self aware and who is trying to better themselves and who has goals, even if they might be sad a lot too. I’m working a lot on my schooling, art, and personal growth. I would like a long term partnership with someone who could be my best friend and other half in everything. I don’t ever want kids, I hate religion, I like drugs, and I don’t fuck with conservatives or moderates. Idk why John Mulaney is such a perfect example of my type but again I do not like sports or fitness or any of that masculine shit... so like John Mulaney on that too. Another thing-I do like twinks a lot physically, but I am not interested in a very submissive man. I want someone a little more passive than me but more or less equal in every way. I’m also not into any sissy fetishes or the like. 😬 felt I needed to disclaim that here. Oh yeah and I also love the 1980s and I love classic rock, pop, and new wave music. I am an old soul and eclectic and eccentric. 

Not expecting anything but gotta do it just cause I guess! I can send pics or chat in private messages if the occasion arises."
autism,febc1xu,t3_eoc527,1578957332.0,"lol, I think you’re just high dude. You can’t cure autism. I think thc helps with self awareness, perception, anxiety etc it did for me. It made me less socially awkward. But it’s not a cure man. If you want further perception shifts and awareness. Try mushrooms"
depression_memes,fe9sng2,t1_fe9rdl3,1578941122.0,I always tried to build up the courage but I never did it. I got very close but ultimately I knew I didn’t want it to end. If you have to psych yourself up it’s probably not a good idea
depression_memes,fe9sdhl,t1_fe9kco2,1578941033.0,Well you have good taste my friend
Art,fe9s626,t1_fe9ku8l,1578940981.0,Oh I forgot there is one more portrayal “sassy black fat lady”
depression_memes,fe9k7q7,t3_eo7c54,1578938615.0,Your artistic skill alone is worth surviving for
Art,fe9k3q1,t3_eo7c6v,1578938559.0,"I feel this too. The world looks down on you so much if you have a large stomach, especially as a woman. Basically in media fat people of both sexes are only portrayed as funny or pathetic. Never attractive or complex. At least I’m funny..."
