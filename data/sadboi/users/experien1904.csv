I met my wife at our 20's, we earn the same amount of money and we spent everything 50/50, then she found a job that pays her 5 times more than mine.

It was ok to me the 50\\50 thing, but she would have to adjust to my paycheck lifestyle, so we decided that I would begin studying again, that was not a big toll on our new budget, we would be loosing 1/6 of it. Expecting with my new college degree I could find a better job.

So now she is paying the house | monthly expenses | our child education that is like 35 percent of her income, and I take 10 percent of her income to my survival (eating and gasoline only), sometimes I feel like I'm abusing her, but it was a common decision.

It was also a difficult decision for people to accept (my parents, her parents, friends). I think if it was her going back to college it would be more socially accepted.

TL DR - I'm in the same situation as your brother, maybe he is not a narcissist and it was a common decision."

I would do the same thing as you suggested, now that I think about it my parents did it at the approximate age he is now.

I had been bullied all my high school etc. 
When I went to uni. I got friends that I really liked and a PlayStation, when my friends connected to a group of girls becoming a large group and some girl seemed to despise me it acted as a trigger and I to cope with it, started to play all day, puuum gaming addict, missed all classes and stuff and end up quitting uni.
