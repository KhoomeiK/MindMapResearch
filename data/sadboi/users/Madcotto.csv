IF he has any mental problems this may come out during that or with a therapist if he needs it for the alcohol.   

I don't think any way of saying ""you drink too much"" or ""dude you got issues"" that's not going get a 18yos back up.

But really if he is drinking as much as you say that's a very slippy slope into a hole that's almost impossible get out of as I'm sure you know so that's where id start and see what comes of it.

You the one in my home as it were its upto you to prove yourself worthy of me spending more than a few mins on a question that as I stated rilles me up.  I'm sure as you pointed out people making assumptions about an OCD character could possibly wind you up if asked so often and so often wrong.

I'm not a good writer as you can see and want to belittle me for and having the spoons available to write an answer on Reddit that would take an entire encyclopedia to write correctly is not something I'm doing out the gate.

But actually I have decades of experience with SZ and SZ people you seemed to assume what I was telling you was incorrect.  The long and short of it getting SZ correct is virtually impossible as its very personal experience it's not just ""the voices"" -suicide squad.  So when it comes to SZ i kind of do ""know it all"" and yet so little about it too.

If not like /u/Moopoboopo says keep a log of what happening to you.  This is much easer than trying to recall on a few mins Appointment.  Then take this with you to GP and ask for a referral if they refuse you can request a second opinion,  telling them this may give them the little kick up the ass they need to do it.
