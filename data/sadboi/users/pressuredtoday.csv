I grate a potato and a carrot using a cheese grater, cut up a few pieces of broccoli, and add it all to a pan with some oil and a bit of water. (Important: Use a clean towel or some paper towels to squeeze out excess liquid from shredded potatoes.)

If I‚Äôm feeling hungrier, I‚Äôll add some crumbled tofu, but here I cut up a Tofurky sausage link instead (which I usually avoid, but everyone is panic-buying all the tofu). I usually serve with ketchup or sriracha.

He had downloaded an app to text me and make it look like it was from a different number, and proceeded to use it to pretend a stalker was after me trying to kill me (and would give various details on what I was doing, like the stalker was watching me).

I was relatively ‚Äúinternet famous‚Äù, so it wasn‚Äôt a stretch to believe I had a stalker (I already got a lot of weird DMs).

Two weeks of not sleeping, talking to the police and starting an investigation, having nonstop brutal panic attacks. All the while, he was comforting me.

When it eventually dawned on me what was happening, I felt heartbroken. I approached him about it, and he was just silent. For some reason, I didn‚Äôt cry when we broke up. I was numb.

It was about a month later of this numbness that I recalled a particular detail of the situation that finally made me start crying for the first time. In the middle of one of my panic attacks, the ‚Äústalker‚Äù was messaging me, and he was comforting me as I was uncontrollably breathing and my heart rate was soaring. While he was comforting me, he sent me a message as the ‚Äústalker‚Äù further describing how he was going to kill me. This only made the panic attack worse of course, and he clearly did it for this purpose.

I felt so hurt. Five years of a relationship, no warning signs (that I noticed), and then he meticulously plans something that would ultimately leave me with PTSD for 2.5 years afterwards.

I am luckily better now and have fully healed. Thank god he‚Äôs no longer in my life."
