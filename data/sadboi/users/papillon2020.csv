CougarsAndCubs,fm4hxka,t1_fm2zini,1585754475.0,Thank you
SuicideWatch,fm4ht9m,t3_fsmc3h,1585754410.0,"First of all, thank you for what you do. You are a truly beautiful, selfless and brave soul. You are doing what God has called you to do. He has given you the skills to help people but He doesn’t expect you to do all the heavy lifting. That’s where He does His job. It’s perfectly normal to say I need a break and I need this moment to myself. Take care of your needs. Go call a friend. Go pick up your favorite take out restaurant food. I wish I could do what you could."
CougarsAndCubs,fm2wfi1,t1_fm272k9,1585706997.0,I don’t plan to ever have children. They are great but not for me. He probably does want them.
CougarsAndCubs,fm2vz0m,t1_fm2nmpl,1585706690.0,He already is. I am just going to let him do that if he wants to. I understand how fragile this situation is.
CougarsAndCubs,fm2ub5r,t1_fm2u6j4,1585705589.0,Thank you for your kindness.
CougarsAndCubs,fm2u2bz,t1_fm2spvb,1585705430.0,Thank you for your advice. Hugs
CougarsAndCubs,fm259ww,t1_fm251kd,1585690854.0,No it wasn’t sexual in nature. We actually had intelligent conversations. You may be right.
CougarsAndCubs,fm1wvnm,t1_fm1re1m,1585686465.0,Yeah
antinatalism,fm0hznk,t3_fsaani,1585658288.0,I do not understand why there are parents who are trying to compete with the doctors. It’s really insulting.
antinatalism,fm0hr5j,t3_fs5c7i,1585658099.0,There were 3 of us kids in the family and the attention still wasn’t even.
childfree,flpsrn4,t1_flmhlcf,1585367785.0,Yes not only women but teenage girls too.
childfree,flprxpy,t3_fq1poy,1585367134.0,"They can sing children songs all they want. Sing louder for the first responders, doctors and nurses!!!! Better yet use those loudspeakers and turn up the volume!"
SuicideWatch,flf4aum,t1_flezjff,1585097739.0,"Love your answer, thank you"
TrueChristian,fle7e16,t1_fldvsbr,1585078983.0,"Thank you for sharing that. I am a 44 years old and I have never had children. So many questions about life, pregnancy and many other things. I do not mean any disrespect to anyone."
TrueChristian,flcfra8,t3_fny0o5,1585029207.0,Thank you. I needed that today.
prolife,flcbrq4,t1_flbx9kz,1585025443.0,How can you prove that the mother was healthy ? What if she isn’t?
prolife,flcbnxo,t1_flbwdyq,1585025349.0,You are not understanding that an ectopic baby is growing and stuck in the fallopian tube. It will not move. That’s where it gets dangerous for the pregnant woman because of internal bleeding.
prolife,flcbjya,t1_flbjvcy,1585025253.0,What do you do to save an ectopic pregnancy then?
prolife,flcbhmu,t1_flbjc44,1585025197.0,What do you do to save an ectopic pregnancy? You didn’t quite answer the question.
antinatalism,flcax59,t3_fnl5z5,1585024714.0,"If a couple wants to be childfree then they need to take action to either get a vasectomy or a bilateral salpingectomy so something like this never ever happens. Why? Birth control can fail. Stealthing (BC tampering)  happens. Either person in a relationship lies about being childfree or wanting to be a parent. Abortion is awful and should never ever be an existence. And when you are dating with marriage as the goal : one of the first questions should be this:  Do you want kids? There are 3 answers - be sure you are honest. 1. I want kids as soon as possible. 2. I want kids in about (....) years. 3. I do not want kids ever. 

Believe these answers the first time."

childfree,fl87rxa,t3_fn5gtv,1584917666.0,"Better to be alone than be married to the wrong person. Bullets have been dogged. Yes, it can be lonely being childfree but so are the women who have rambunctious children."
antinatalism,fl7m48b,t3_fn2bat,1584904587.0,This picture is wrong on so many levels.
CozyPlaces,fl6ke37,t3_fmkdra,1584872938.0,Nice! I also like your blue sofa!
childfree,fl6b1x6,t3_fmub44,1584860985.0,Kids can be witty and interesting. I understand what you mean. This world can be mean. Why would I want a person “I made” be subject to the cruelty here?
childfree,fl1637l,t3_flsyiy,1584722717.0,Congratulations!! Best wishes for you both!
childfree,fkzx4md,t1_fkwpo4j,1584683179.0,"My mother did not treat me as the center of her universe. I was in her universe, however, she made it clear that her husband who is also my father, was her center. Good going, Mom! These breeders need to think and behave like this."
childfree,fkzvok7,t1_fky2dqf,1584681820.0,Yes!!!
childfree,fkzvlqy,t1_fky9yif,1584681751.0,Christian here. I agree!
childfree,fkzv2mv,t1_fky8zye,1584681274.0,"I am a Christian and I love this statement! I used to call myself prolife but I didn’t understand what it really meant to the ones against abortion. Abortion is not pretty but have to say, it can be the best decision for the woman at risk. Now I am pro-choice."
childfree,fkuje2e,t1_fktj8mx,1584550511.0,That’s the correct phrase. Haha.
CozyPlaces,fkjrp6y,t3_fioleg,1584256634.0,Beautiful! I could never go to sleep during that time. I would stare at the sky until the northern lights aren’t visible anymore.
childfree,fkjoyc1,t3_fifsri,1584253403.0,"It made so mad today. There was a woman outside a Whole Foods store and she was hoarding so much toilet paper. I would have understood a small case or two but not a whole buggy filled up to the top. Lady, other families need them too. And yes, a husband and wife is a family."
SuicideWatch,fkbqmla,t1_fkbq7yy,1584037988.0,"I understand. This is where financial planning on your part comes in. Be frugal, live within your means. Eventually, you will find a like-minded girlfriend/wife who thinks the same."
SuicideWatch,fkbpu1s,t1_fkbov7k,1584037560.0,"I understand that. If you feel you need to hold off until your sister can help your mom when she needs the help then put it on hold. But while it’s on hold, still be prepared. It can be tough being a single woman but I have a feeling that your mom is tougher than she gives herself credit for. She has dreams of her own. Encourage her to meet her dreams while you and sister do. Take up hobbies that she can also make money from."
SuicideWatch,fkbonhg,t1_fkbodsd,1584036923.0,"Well that’s too bad for her, she is going to have to find her own way. You can still be there for her by calling her and visiting when you can. She will get huffy about it for a while but then she will understand you."
SuicideWatch,fkbo6ps,t1_fkbnz9n,1584036667.0,Then you know your answer. Be busy making plans to move and find a job there. First job may not be as much fun but it will get your feet planted.
SuicideWatch,fkbnt1x,t1_fkbcii1,1584036457.0,You will have those things. Be patient- get to know those girls well personality wise. While sex is wonderful- it’s not the end all be all. Quality time is the most important.
SuicideWatch,fkbnhcc,t3_fhfw1e,1584036279.0,I hate that! Do not listen to them. They are the jerks and probably don’t have much going for them as it appears. You live your life to the best of your ability. You are awesome!
childfree,fk7ty4y,t3_fgv5jj,1583943571.0,I am ok with pets. But I don’t want puppies or kittens. And older rescue animals are awesome. They are potty trained and behaved. I love my rescue dog. He is the best and I wish he could live forever with me.
deaf,fk7slon,t3_fgrmlx,1583942841.0,"I had note takers but I don’t trust them. They may have written down important things but sometimes they intentionally leave gaps when some information “left in their heads.” Then you take a test and you get a 90 while they get a 100 because they didn’t write something down. They do not care about you. They care about themselves, getting paid/getting a reward for notetaking. Talk to your teachers about anything that may be left out of notes and read, read, read."
unrequited_love,fk7q3ur,t1_fk6hg0u,1583941470.0,"I never said that they had to have a problem with my feelings. My feelings are valid and so are anyone else’s. I posted that because I am allowed to express myself. And this is Reddit. Its purpose is set up to give people a safe space to say things they want to say, make confessions and have a safe space to vent."
childfree,fjru53a,t1_fjpf9jx,1583590088.0,"That would be an appropriate name for my relatives’ new puppy. My dog likes dogs, he just don’t like her."
deaf,fjo1r42,t3_fdacia,1583518762.0,Yes that would be awesome and hope they are lightweight too!
SuicideWatch,fjlufmq,t3_fdzh7r,1583454707.0,I am so sorry you are having a difficult time. You are 21 and that is the best time to start making your dreams happen. I believe things will look up for you. You are your own person apart from the family. Many blessings and bonne chance!
childfree,fjaobr4,t3_fcdzso,1583177436.0,"I think couples having their own rooms is a excellent idea for several reasons:

1) some couples work different shifts and don’t want to disturb their sleeping partner.

2) one or both can get sick. Need that space alone. 

3) you want a space to put your things 

4) sometimes you need a space to rest and recharge"
Switzerland,fj9hbs1,t3_f82t8n,1583148439.0,Stop it. It’s beautiful!
