theLword,fr460ah,t3_gmkl69,1589877020.0,I like Tina. I just don’t think her character was super interesting. But I definitely didn’t have anything against her that would make me actually dislike her I was just way more interested in everyone else for some reason.
AskReddit,fr42cpk,t1_fr410es,1589873448.0,"Racism and oppression are definitely not mutually inclusive. They can and do exist separately. That’s a pretty straight forward conceptual difference. They do overlap but not always. People say racist things about white people constantly. They’re different than things said about other races yes (like I said apples to oranges) and I was not claiming or comparing it to systemic oppression like the things you brought up (again apples to oranges) And no I’m not talking about dancing and spices. Assumptions none of us ever have to work for anything. Claiming we are racist ourselves. Even more direct threats of harm for being white happen. My niece was threatened in school. This kid said he was going to cut her face up for being lighter than everyone else. Those are just a couple specific examples and you’re willfully ignoring these things if you don’t see them. Again no it’s not “oppression” (never said it was) but it is racist. And yes every one of these situations is different from the other just like they are different from racism other races experience. Yes very much apples to oranges. The existence of one does not void or disprove the existence of the other. 

Why are you so miserable? It’s like you’re trying to prove to me things I’m already aware of as if I somehow denied them in my comments that had nothing to do with anything you brought up. Surely I wasn’t racist or oppressive towards you and I wasn’t equating any of the drastically different things that you are.

Edit: but yes keep thinking things like a little girl to be told she’s going to be disfigured for being white is not a problem if it’s own or is not racist and humiliating. Like I said willful ignorance."
AskReddit,fr3ykxa,t1_fr3ycor,1589870019.0,No not at all. It’s possible to be insulting to anyone of any race for their race. I didn’t claim it had anything to do with any of those things. I actually didn’t even use the word oppression or any form of it. Your whole comment was putting words in my mouth. Quit being dramatic and trying to compare apples to oranges. “Your problems don’t exist because this this and this also exist”. Get outside your closed little box of a mind for a minute.
AskReddit,fr3tgqc,t1_fr36nz2,1589865801.0,"This is true. I have a feeling they’re more outspoken only because they don’t face stigma associated with being racist the same way white people do. I live somewhere where whites are a bit closer to the minority and everyone else kinda degrades us regularly. It’s socially acceptable to do so here. It never gets corrected which is why there’s no attention on it. Some of the time it’s meant as a joke, but a lot of the time it’s serious. Even when it is meant as a joke they really do believe there’s truth to the shitty things they say about me for being white. 

These are people I see as friends too and it feels like shit. I just don’t argue about it because I don’t feel like it’s worth rocking the boat. I value their friendship too much to jeopardize it which I realize is not helping but whatever.

Edit to add: About the lack of stigma associated with non-whites being racists maybe being the cause. Just read the exchange in the thread below this comment if you want proof. Absolute disbelief racism towards whites ever happens. Reducing it to silly jokes about spices and dancing. No that stuff is just funny I’m not crying over that. Denying it to people who tell you they have actually experienced it. And it really isn’t as rare as a lot of people assume either."

Never “came out” and just denied it. Just over the last couple years realized I’m probably not. The reason why interactions with other women genuinely get me more excited and interested is just that. The reason why I’m a boring lay for a guy (no my husbands never told me this I just know I am because I’m genuinely not that into it) is probably because I’m just fuckin gay. Even just being touched by women feels better to me.

actuallesbians,fow6vw6,t1_fow4vts,1588114119.0,Right I get that. When I shared this it was more of an intent to crush the fictional creation of the tradwife on the left though.

Like he obviously created her to fit into his little wife box he considers “ideal” and the image on the right is countering that.

actuallesbians,fow105q,t1_fow0f1z,1588111034.0,Well I mean that’s the way they’re interpreting it I guess. I definitely see how that’s counterintuitive to the feminist point.

actuallesbians,fow08ip,t1_fovzxto,1588110637.0,Right. I see that. But I think the point of the recreation is turning the fictional characters into better people.

bisexual,foip7c7,t3_g7ki4w,1587792688.0,Right. Just do you and don’t get upset that other people do them.
gatekeeping,foip0r1,t1_foinjml,1587792529.0,Right people should just lighten up. Like really we are allowed to laugh at ourselves every once in a while. That’s all this guy was doing.
gatekeeping,foile2u,t1_fogz25x,1587789622.0,Well that’s why I think this was just a joke. I don’t feel like a guy willing to do that to make a silly video is really all that insecure about his masculinity.
gatekeeping,foilaa4,t3_g7aep9,1587789542.0,I actually think this is just a silly joke. I mean the guy was clearly ok with putting his hair in pig tails like he did to get laughs. He’s probably not as insecure as everyone is making it out to be.

Your services are awful and sub par but I still must go to Applebee’s anyway. Just so I can have another kid serve me for free because it’s not what I like. 

If you don’t like it you don’t have to go. Neither of these opinions were unpopular. Just one are totally fine with having someone serve them for no pay just because the industry doesn’t function the way that they personally believe it should and the other are not. 

I don’t even personally agree with it I think the employer should take accountability for paying their employees but I’m sure as hell not going to go out and have someone wait on me for free because of beef I have with the system. Again if it bothers you so much just don’t go. Don’t give your money to the industry. Eat at home or somewhere you don’t have to be waited on.

And yes you’re an entitled fuck for doing this. You sound like such a pussy piece of shit. “Be nice to me wahhhh”"
