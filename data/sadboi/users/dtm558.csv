Well I would still be on pheni but as it completely stopped working for me (taking 2g had literally the same effect like not taking anything at all) I was forced to go with alternative meds to keep me sane.  

pregabalin/lyrica half-life is 6-7h and bac is 3-4h.   
So I guess I could split pregabalin into 3 and bac to even 8 times a day. With baclofen since they are pills it's easier but as lyrica comes in capsules and I have them in 150s I would have to eventually start opening them and dividing that powder amount in half to get 75s and in thirds to get 50s.     


Does the following taper plan sound reasonable all things considered?

* 1st week bac 75mg lyr 450 
* 2nd lyr 450 to 300 
* 3rd bac from 75 to 63.5

* 5th bac from 63.5 to 50 
* 6th lyr from 225 to 150 
* 7th bac from 50 to 35.5 
* 8th lyr 150 to 100 (tough to measure at this point) 
* 9th bac from 35.5 to 25

quittingphenibut,flwp606,t1_fluvdlt,1585559473.0,">it does effect the VGCC in a somewhat meaningful way, as compared to phenibut, as it only has about 4 times weaker binding affinity for a2d than phenibut (Ki=156um for baclofen vs Ki=39um for phenibut).

Now you're manipulating numbers mate. As we already established, baclofen binds to GABAb with 26 times greater affinity than VGCC (while phenibut acts mainly on VGCC ). You would have to complete flood your GABA receptors with bac by megadosing it before it becomes actively working on VGCC.

As for what best worked for you, that's a subjective matter. Gabapentin (unlike pregabalin) has low bioavailability so it's hard to tell how much is actually getting into your system which might be one of the reasons it didn't work for you.

Personally I think baclofen is a better option to try after prolonged daily habit with phenibut but only because it allows for VGCC to recover much more quickly."

Gabapentin acts similarly to phenibut, it's not a magical drug. Max prescribable dose is 3.6g. If you are taking as much as you wrote and still getting bad withdrawals then you are still not close to covering phenibut and you can't just quit gabap as this needs to be tapered too."

quittingphenibut,fiaym01,t1_fi9m78t,1582310998.0,I would love to but where I live that's illegal and hard to get.
quittingphenibut,fi44egk,t1_fi3qt5h,1582133751.0,That packaging is odd. I can only get them in little bottles 10mg and 25mg.
quittingphenibut,fi41t8d,t1_fi3f4w6,1582132251.0,Well then I don't think you have anything to worry about :)
quittingphenibut,fi3dzkm,t3_f60b3g,1582113402.0,"You did not ""fucked up"". 5 days is not a lot. The question is what were you using before. For someone who was clean and used baclofen 5 days in a row I would expect to not have any withdrawals at all and would advice do a rapid taper just in case (take 50 then 25 then 10 and stop)."
quittingphenibut,fi3dodv,t1_fhh49os,1582113057.0,"Well that's in simple terms that's just ""diazepam made stronger and last longer""."
quittingphenibut,fhdmxe6,t3_f2cpvf,1581492067.0,"Benzos supposed to act on the same receptors, right? But I'm puzzled then why some of them work for me while others do not."
quittingphenibut,fhc4mkj,t1_fhbtjgf,1581456114.0,I know that in theory it should be like xanax xr dose corrected (1:2 ratio as I've heard). But in practice I found it to be euphoric like no other benzo.
quittingphenibut,fhalqyp,t1_fh8083y,1581417047.0,">It wasn't until I realized I needed to get off of it and started tapering that I realized my self confidence was all that was holding me back.  One day I was feeling super miserable and had to run to the store but my social anxiety was kicking in again due to the taper.  I asked myself what the difference was from when I was on phenibut and the ONLY thing was the way my brain made me feel while on phenibut. I am still the same person with the same intelligence, looks and personality.

It all sounds so profound and stuff but what exactly did you do  then once you realized that?You didn't go out to that store, did you?What you mention as the ""ONLY"" thing is the thing which we all crave the most - to have more money, big house, beautiful family and a nice car - to be brutally honest we ONLY want these things because of the **feeling** they give us.As an example if you were given an opportunity to drive Bugatti Chiron but knew for a fact that as soon as you hopped in it would instantly make you depressed and suicidal for years you would despise that car wouldn't you."
quittingphenibut,fhajoc1,t1_fha5liu,1581413957.0,"Thanks mate, it sounds simple yet is so true that by reading this something just ""clicked"" in the back of my head.  👍"
quittingphenibut,fhaj079,t1_fh9npgy,1581412961.0,"First of all You can have seizures from suddenly stopping phenibut too. Furthermore your issue is unrelated as you tried to jump to baclofen which isn't even mentioned once in OP. 

Phenibut mechanism of action includes **both** how baclofen and lyrica/gabapentin work.  Yet baclofen is an entirely different animal compared to lyrica or gabap. It's almost like comparing benzos with neurontin."
quittingphenibut,fhaio8w,t3_f20ljd,1581412479.0,"6g of gabap is a ton. That's like 1g of lyrica. You would need way more than 1g of phenibut to counteract it. Yes it's possible if your body responds but that's playing with fire and you are much better off getting hospitalized.   
Yet if you absolutely must do this alone or for some reason hospitalization is not possible... I would slowly start with 500mg then re-dose to kill the appearing withdrawal symptoms and see where you stand by the end of the day.  Just don't go crazy with re-dosing bt trying to get high rather than covering for gabap."
quittingphenibut,fhai8ko,t1_fh9mowc,1581411852.0,Since you mentioned it.. Doing that will actually make the symptoms **worse** by making dopamine receptors even less sensitive.
quittingphenibut,fhai0mu,t1_fha2arx,1581411544.0,100mg of lyrica is like 700mg of gabapentin so you should feel it. It's not a huge dose but it defo should work better than magnesium supplements or calming teas.
quittingphenibut,fh7oase,t1_fgisrnc,1581339901.0,"Not completely through but with dosage decreased by a tenfold using various things they do. So it's nothing like going hard mode and cutting your dosage just like that.However you are released being on edge (at least in my case) rather than being comfortable so it's very easy to fuck it all up by taking more or abusing baclofen ""just this one time"".Then for the next several days you pretty much become a hermit."
quittingphenibut,fh7nsqi,t1_fgcq141,1581339433.0,It's illegal here hence I would have to use darknet which is too big of a risk for something like this.
quittingphenibut,fgf0ef1,t1_fgeqdf9,1580717763.0,Were your dosages scattered rather than steadily declining during first taper?
quittingphenibut,fgc5lku,t1_fg6efin,1580669388.0,">I'd love to say go inpatient detox but they function off protocols and there isn't a detox in the U. S. with a protocol for phenibut. I've looked.

How about thinking rationally here then and telling them that you're addicted to equivalent dosage of lyrica? This must surely work. Otherwise those protocols are bs."
