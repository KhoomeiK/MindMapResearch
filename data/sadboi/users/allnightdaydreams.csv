At age 12 the daughter is old enough to have a conversation about this. I would let your wife and if she feels it's a good idea, the daughter's dad too, know that you would like to have this conversation. Ask the daughter is she is ready to have you call her your daughter, or if she is ready to call you her dad. I would open it up as, ""I've always loved you as my daughter, but I don't want to overstep a boundary you're uncomfortable with it. Either way I'll still be the same person towards you I've always been."" Even if you don't love her as you might your own blood, it is something that the daughter would want hear whether she says/acts like it. This could either bring the two of you closer, or just keep your relationship where it's at. At the end of the day this is yours and your stepdaughters relationship so it really only matters what the two of you think."

I made a point to start journaling when I feel myself splitting. And it PAINED ME to apologise last night but I knew I had to. The BPD was still trying to tell me ""you're right"" even though he disproved everything I thought. This morning I woke up feeling all kinds of guilty (per usual...) And sent him a real apology text. It was REALLY HARD to not try to emotionally manipulate him though. I start thinking about what I was gonna say and stopped myself. This isn't about me and my problems and taking out feel bad for me. This is me taking responsibility for what I did wrong. I said ""I'm sorry again and you have every right not to talk to me anymore.

I am so fucking functional on the surface and I am aware that I'm splitting, but sometimes I can't control what I do. It's like there's a sane side of me, but the BPD side is so powerful. The sadness, guilt, anger, hatred for oneself is overwhelming. Even though I can recognize it I just want it gone. I try to talk to my best friend about how I'm feeling and she usually calms me down and tells me if what I'm feeling is rational or crazy. Not judgement just kind of shows me the facts that just because I feel a certain way doesn't make it the reality. But if she does validate something that I'm feeling then it's like world war 3. Like fuck you I'm not crazy. Did this just today with the guy I'm seeing. His best friend is a girl and I'm very uncomfortable with their relationship. She blows his phone up constantly, but he's always been super honest about her. I had to do mental gymnastics to make it seem like it's something it's not. Told my friend before I acted crazy towards him to make sure it's validated. She was like no that's weird. So I lost it on him. And now I feel guilty and worthless for saying anything to him because I went off and he didn't deserve that.

Sorry I just went on my own rant, but I'll tell you what it helps to talk this shit out with someone else. You're always welcome to message me if you're splitting and feeling insane.

If his anxiety is at such a high level, he may not even feel comfortable seeking out help. When my anxiety was out of hand, it took me five years to finally reach out for help. And when I did, I got turned down a few times for insurance reasons, not accepting patients, ect. It took me 6 more months to finally find someone to help. To you, his fears seem irrational and silly. But to him his fears are all too real. When you have anxiety that bad it is like you are LIVING the fear that exists in front of you. He's scared of the dog running away and getting hit? To him when he feels like it is like it has already happened. That is the best way I can explain it. Coping mechanisms are fantastic, the best one my therapist taught me was when you feel the anxiety coming on, is to completely distract yourself. For me that is doing something physical that I probably don't enjoy, but will make me feel better afterwards. I deep clean something for an hour, go do rigorous exercise. Something that physically removes myself from the intrusive thoughts and distracts me for long enough that when I'm finished with said activity the thoughts are not present, and I feel accomplished for doing something I didn't want to do. Enough times doing this my brain started to reset itself. It wouldn't go straight into panic mode at a thought, because I wouldn't let it. My brain was used to always jumping to the worst conclusions. Anxiety is terrible and I feel for your husband. I feel for you and your family as well, but he needs help to break the cycle.
