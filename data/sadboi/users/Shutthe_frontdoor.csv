You'll need to have them commissioned, not notarized. I know my office doesn't commission things for non-clients usually because we're snobby haha. But places like Red Seal can for a fee as well as some less bougie law firms.  Any licensed lawyer or paralegal can commission for you, doesn't have to be a family lawyer. And clerks at the court can do it for free. 

But note that to get something commissioned properly, the commissioner has to witness the person signing the document ie: you cant bring a thing already signed by someone else to a commissioner to be commissioned. So  practically speaking you will have to go with your ex to see someone to commission your affidavits for divorce. He cant just sign and leave with you."

Yup that shouldnt be a problem. It usually is only an issue with things like middle names. 

Also, pro tip for submitting your documents online: the system is fucking annoying with file names. Like it can't be more than like 6 characters. So save your .pdfs with short names. Also dont include hyphens in your phone numbers or it freaks out too. When you submit you should get the issued application back via email within minutes (provided the court is open). 

Oh and make sure both your affidavits for divorce are properly commissioned!

legaladvicecanada,fr5beu3,t1_fr4uxrg,1589905765.0,"Also FYI if you're doing in jointly it's pretty much impossible for it to turn into litigation because you're both singing a form that says you have no other claims other than a divorce.

Not to say he couldn't later pursue a property claim, but the onus would be on him to do that obviously."
legaladvicecanada,fr5agit,t1_fr57ggo,1589905306.0,"Honestly, normally Newmarket is usually the absolute fucking WORST courthouse in the GTA imo but I was absolutely floored in the fall when I got a divorce order a month after I submitted it. Pleasant surprise! With no kids and no property it is really just a matter of a judge making sure you've been separated for a year. So if you have filled out everything alright it's very simple and straightforward.  Just make sure your names on the application matches your marriage certificate that you must submit. If for whatever reason they do not, you will have to submit a separate affidavit which is annoying and dumb. 

I personally have never heard of expediting the 31 day wait period, as the standard issue divorce order includes this clause. My boss (lawyer) simply tells people to calculate accordingly when planning to re-marry. Practically, by the time you get the order back in the mail a couple of weeks have usually passed already so it's just a matter of days. 

This is purely me guessing because I'm lazy right now and not looking up practice directions or the family law rules, but you could **possibly** submit a consent 14B motion form and supporting affidavit simultaneously with the application asking for a waiver of the 31 day period and an explanation of why this is needed. But again, I've never done it for a client and you would probably need to demonstrate exceptional circumstances. You also can't submit a 14B online unlike your divorce application."
