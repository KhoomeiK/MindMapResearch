Depression happens when the conditions in your brain are just right to pave the way. Read the book The Upward Spiral by Alex Korb. He explains it really well.
I've had severe, recurrant depression since age 10. Almost 30 years now. I've felt that way for as long as I can remember. So long that I'm not even sure what joy feels like. I would ask someone who doesn't have depression to see if they ever feel that way. To me, it sounds like you are depressed. Kudos to you for being open minded enough to consider it."

Love bombing is sort of like bombarding you with affection to get you hooked into a false sense of security and then they back way off. It can go back and forth though. Bread crumbing is when they string you along as a fail safe when they think they can do better. They're both much more complex than my simplification though so definitely do some searching on it.

• most people only post their highlight reel and humble brag. That is terrible for someone with severe depression to read constantly.
No body wants to be depressed. I would get comments and likes sometimes, too, it doesn't mean I was seeking them. Most times, I would've rather not had a comments section but there isn't a way to turn that off. That wasn't the point of posting though. It was to let people I care about know that they aren't alone. Maybe just try to let them be and judge them less. Getting out of bed and existing is hard when you're severely depressed.
