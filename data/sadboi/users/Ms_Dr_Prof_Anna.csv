Also, I don't think that's the case. Hoffman is apathetic towards his victims. He doesn't necessarily enjoy their pain. Except for Seth but that's besides the point lmao. He just wanted to be the next Jigsaw. He even asked one of the survivors if they actually learned from the experience. 

He just wants to be in control of and all of the situation. John was always in his head for being a threat and it messes him up because he knows what he did. He could have left the country there after he's dead. Like who cares about Jill at that point he had so much time when he first got the stomach tape. 

Also, his games are winnable (except for seth, again lol). He is the only student who actually followed the rules until he went Sans and mudered a bunch of people because his identity is being revealed. He wouldn't really do that, again. If Jill would just keep her mouth shut and be alongside him continuing her husband's legacy. And for the fact she literally tried to kill him. That makes her distasteful in John's morals as well.

He's incredibly smart, resourceful and strong like he just pulled a knife off his neck like it's nothing. He had a lot of potential. Amanda had a choice as well. Anyway, I do feel he's still alive tho."
