apexuniversity,fj46ao9,t3_fbgqq5,1583001258.0,"Gold is the average player's tier, there you can excel just by having above average aim and movement. Beyond that is where you really need to make calls, communicate and coordinate with your team to even have a chance to win."
apexuniversity,fj41f0e,t3_fb3o6u,1582998068.0,"I always try to keep my distance, always on the edge of the brawl ready to clean up. One thing I could say to avoid choking, always assume you're gonna win the fight but always play your opponents with respect, don't rush in blindly. FPS games probably the closest we have to chess as every single input can drastically change the outcome of a fight, so think about every button you press. Yes developing muscle memory is good but you don't want to go so far that you play half your matched on auto pilot. So just being conscious of what you're doing will improve your plays as well as reduce the panic sprays."
