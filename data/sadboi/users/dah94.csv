UpliftingNews,foecg4c,t1_foe4b7t,1587700523.0,"It says hearing-impaired, not exclusively deaf. My dad has hearing aids, but he relies heavily on lip reading to supplement when communicating. He's a truck driver and is constantly talking to people at warehouses, stores, etc. and they often have to lift their mask for him to understand what they're saying. For him, people not having to lift their mask would be much safer for him, especially since he's stopping in heavily populated areas all over the country. I think it's a wonderful idea, but more so in theory because yes, that would require many people to wear these masks and it's highly unlikely most people will."

AskWomen,fk7tf9j,t3_fgxxz8,1583943289.0,"I don't know if I've recovered. I consider it more of moving on and forgiving myself for staying in a bad situation far longer than I should have. I spent a lot of time in bed and isolated from pretty much everyone (except when I went to work) for the first couple of weeks. I went shopping a *lot* and cried an unimaginable amount of tears. I would talk to a few choice friends and my mom after the initial grief started to lessen, and I started being more open about it as time passed. It really helped to talk to people who wanted to support me when I finally let them. I had fantasized of all the freedom I would have, what new things I could do and how I could really make my life mine once we were done, but it took me a couple of months before I really put action into actually making the changes I wanted to without feeling guilt or suffocating grief. It's been 7 months now and it still hurts sometimes, but the initial heartbreak has worn off, I've met someone who treats me 1000x better and I've started actually doing the things he held me back from doing.

He should never see the light of day again. And then the secondary trigger for me is simply the reminder that the man who violated me will never be punished or held accountable for what he did. He doesn't feel sorry. He gets to live a normal life while I'll be permanently scarred by his actions.

I think maybe I'm trying to throw in the towel too soon with therapy. I think I just need to start seeing someone new. I've been terrified of the idea because then I'm just starting completely over...but at the same time we haven't discussed a fraction of my trauma or issues, so really I wouldn't be losing much ground. I think it's so true that my mind is ahead of my heart. I've read a couple of books about CBT and healing after trauma, so I grasp a lot of the ideas, I'm just horrible at implementing the changes. And I really think I need someone to push me and guide me because doing it on my own has never worked. I think I'll try working on all my goals above while searching for a new therapist.

I had no idea what to do to make it stop. After an hour of this, my supervisor saw me hiding out in my office and thought I was sick and sent me home. I needed to see her at my next appointment a few days after that and she canceled. And she canceled the two following appointments as well. It was devastating to me.

relationship_advice,feihzbv,t3_eowdx0,1579138966.0,"I don't know about *all* women, but height certainly doesn't matter to me. My boyfriend is 5'4 and his height has never bothered me. He is more than attractive enough just the way he is!

As for working on the insecurity...it's a tough deal. I decided last year to focus on making as many good eating/exercise changes I could and to stop thinking I have to look like a VS model in order to find love. Between being a bit more active, eating less things that make me feel like garbage and telling myself that I'm beautiful in my own way, I've come a long way in being insecure about my appearance. While I do care about looking good in that I'm well-groomed and somewhat healthy, I just tell myself I don't give a shit whether or not people find me attractive/hot. If they don't like how I look, that's their loss. It sounds stupid typed out, but chanting that mantra in my brain for the last year really has helped me to stop comparing myself to other girls and putting myself down so much.

The bottom line is that if someone is shallow enough to not be with you solely because of your height, they don't deserve your time and you have *got* to at least try to recognize your value before you can be with someone or your insecurities will follow you and you'll end up having a very hard time believing your partner when they compliment you on the things they love about you.

You've got this, dude. Try not to much too much pressure on yourself.

Best wishes from another 24 year old navigating the worst dating scene in history. :)
