bipolar,fos7dsu,t3_g98kpu,1588025307.0,You've come a very long way. Hope you never forget that. Happy for you!
bipolar,fogefbb,t3_g6zxu9,1587751524.0,"Definitely manic. I suggest seeing a doctor, and if that's kinda hard atm, maybe find an online therapist? So you can get that energy out in some way, and gain some self understanding with this realization of being BP2. Sorry it's a lot right now. But things will become more clear and calm, I hope for you."
bipolar2,fn4cabv,t3_fz8dbe,1586638426.0,Felt homie. Same.
bipolar,fmd4mdh,t1_fmd4a7c,1585959219.0,You’re right...ugh. I’m not gonna like this but I’ll give them a call Monday. Thank you for your input.
bipolar,fmd3wea,t1_fmd3n41,1585958764.0,"It's gonna be embarrassing, but I don't have another choice. Even with a bad working environment I should just suck it up?"
bipolar,fkgc166,t3_fi3uqz,1584155357.0,Omgggg I love it
bipolar,fkc23ex,t1_fkc1imn,1584044289.0,"And I apologize if I sounded snappy. I don't like typing
:( not my best voice. Clearly."
bipolar,fkc1wwf,t1_fkc1imn,1584044190.0,Yeah. In person interactions is the way to go. I'm painfully soft spoken and get scared when I even say anything at all. So it's all good. We all different out here.
bipolar,fkc1al2,t1_fkbzzdi,1584043848.0,Also I did accept the apology. I'm not the best at like... saying too many things out loud in typing form. I just kinda talk in my mind. So I'm also sorry if I've made you upset on any way if that's how you felt.
bipolar,fkc08tn,t1_fkbzzdi,1584043267.0,"I'm not even mad, like again, the assuming. You gotta be more self aware."
bipolar,fkbzpkk,t1_fkbzk0x,1584042972.0,"Eek. You're a vain one. That's annoying. Again, the ego ain't cute."
bipolar,fkbza8d,t1_fkbym9y,1584042740.0,This was just story telling. Not an advice call.
bipolar,fkbqv1a,t1_fkaklur,1584038119.0,Well you are a reader. You don't really know what my timeline looks like. I have been off and on before. It's not like I'm ignorant. So chill with the ego of knowing what's best. It's not welcoming or attractive to just assume.
bipolar,fk9y8e1,t1_fk8pxhk,1583986620.0,You a doctor or something?
bipolar,fk8pag5,t1_fk8n9qb,1583960318.0,Apparently another BP friend on here said it's cool to do when on lamital. My dose isn't high at all so I think I'll be safe. As for imbalance it's already here so what difference would it be anyways lol
bipolar,fk8p40m,t1_fk891vu,1583960224.0,You're definitely not alone. I feel the same.
bipolar,fk8lh3j,t1_fk81e5r,1583958302.0,You're so nice. Thank you :) helps very much
bipolar,fk80ykk,t1_fk80cit,1583947301.0,For real? Then this changes things:))
bipolar,fk80wg7,t1_fk7ye95,1583947269.0,Therapy is always a plus. :) I'm glad you're being helped. I'm just trying to find... nature therapy I suppose.
bipolar,fk80mkv,t1_fk7v5we,1583947123.0,I loved this story. Thank you :) most definitely will watch that as well. I think I'm almost in the right headspace to do it.
bipolar,fk80i92,t1_fk7unri,1583947058.0,True
bipolar,fk80d38,t1_fk7rpu6,1583946985.0,This is been my favorite insight so far. Thank you for answering my questions lol and glad to hear your demons are leaving you alone. Trying to get mine to do that.
bipolar,fk8067k,t1_fk7p6fc,1583946882.0,I'm looking for information more on the natural side. DMT and Acid are not really considered psychedelics to me personally. Their just let's have fun kinda drugs. Which is why I'm approaching this with more of the nature side to what can help BP2's. But thank you for sharing your story.
bipolar,fk7l0pd,t1_fk7ft28,1583938622.0,How much did you consume? If you don't mind me asking.
bipolar,fk7kyzl,t1_fk7ikdd,1583938595.0,Super insightful. Thank you. I guess it is kinda wishful thinking it could fix this shit. I'm also BP2. So this is good to hear. I think with your story I'll give a micro dose a try.
bipolar,fk7klk7,t1_fk7ix7d,1583938382.0,Oh wow... that's very good to know. Thank you. Honestly I was thinking of backing off my normal meds (lamital) and try shrooms then. Go in clean. I've been on my meds for 5 years :/
bipolar,fk7kh6f,t1_fk7jc0n,1583938311.0,"Well happy to hear that :) natural seems to be the safest route. Unfortunately weed fucks me up. However, CBD though, I recommend for you. If you're isolating yourself."
bipolar,fk7kd11,t1_fk7jmr8,1583938244.0,"I totally understand what you mean, I hope. Thank you for sharing your outlook and use. I assumed it's more of a mental head space kinda deal. Things have been getting slightly better for me. So I will consider it."
depression,fh1wzz2,t3_f10qma,1581226819.0,"Wow, that's kinda fucked. I feel this. Time to try, I know it sucks to say, but try to find other people. It's scary...but give it a shot. Because that's not cool what they did."
depression,fej1ew3,t1_fej1aex,1579153427.0,Thank you. It's okay. Just you responding and acknowledging this..it means enough. Thank you. I'm trying.
depression,fej12xv,t1_fej0trx,1579153107.0,"So much more and I never knew. I'm having trouble, sitting in silence and looking into nothingness. He was my life."
depression,fej0i1d,t1_fej0ahg,1579152559.0,I appreciate your words. You are kind.
depression,fdrbzjs,t1_fdq3ale,1578682345.0,"Whelp, I'm glad someone pointed out this disorder. I'm BP2, the emotional one. However, it's heavier on the depression side. I too...struggle to have or interact with people. Because I put myself down for being who I am,  and mask it. I am on meds but it's comforting to just isolate myself and paint and draw. Art is my friend. Yeah, I know people in passing but it's very hard to get close."
bipolar,fcrlwkn,t3_eidutq,1577903524.0,Omg how cute. You can definitely do this as a good way to support yourself. From one artist to another good job :)
depression,fbye6qp,t3_ef4960,1577214654.0,"Same with my situation. I'm driving out on Christmas day though since I'm working today. But, I hope you have a Merry Christmas."
bipolar,f700h64,t3_dtx4ei,1573322984.0,Congrats for having the will power to get up and do that. I admire these kinda posts. Good luck!
bipolar,f6h9nai,t1_f6h9gdb,1572840527.0,"Thank you. Oh I will, if anything. This has been around way before meds. It's staying ❤️"
bipolar,f6gh6vs,t1_f6g7hhk,1572825998.0,Thank you:)
bipolar,f6gh0cg,t1_f6gbpp5,1572825916.0,If I have prints soon I'll let you know:) those are way cheaper. And I appreciate your compliments very much.
bipolar,f6fpc9d,t1_f6ekktc,1572816647.0,Thanks so much:)
bipolar,f6ffdbs,t1_f6eugc3,1572813718.0,"Uhm, idk. I just do it. So I guess no inspiration for this one. Just arting."
bipolar,f62nal4,t3_dq8go2,1572663273.0,Cooch queen preaching out here.
bipolar,f5394sh,t1_f4yji3b,1571957575.0,And even if they are so what? Their just people with bad intentions. Putting your energy into their black hole doesn't do anything good. It's killing yourself with them.
bipolar,f4tze6b,t3_dlio9w,1571795739.0,"I find a lot of my situations and thoughts in your words. I can give a few helpful things to maybe get your mind in the healthy direction. Hopefully. For one, people at work can get to you. Basically live with them. With that, you have to not take what they're saying personally all the time. I tell myself this, and it helps. As much as you want to believe their gunning for you, their not. They're not even close to perfect either. So just step out of that mind that people are trying to rip you down. You're already fighting your own battle, that's more than enough to deal with. Thinking about what other people want, you are of course going to overload. Care about you, not other dickhead people. With that said, looking for a new job is tough. I myself am trying to leave the same kinda work environment. Where you are can change your mental health, get tf out of there. Change that environment. There are so many ways to get money is this country it's stupid. If you really want change make it for yourself. As a BP2 use that crazy drive and push yourself to better things. You do deserve better. I don't know you, but I know that you don't deserve those feelings of rejection and being misunderstood. I hope that helps you out. Keep going. You're not alone."
bipolar,f4tk70l,t3_dlhta6,1571789552.0,The hand around the neck is too accurate. Really like this one.
bipolar,f4dljr4,t3_dk8br5,1571544235.0,That magenta is just beautiful. I love it.
bipolar2,eypf1uv,t3_cxxphr,1567298240.0,"Lately, I've been feeling the same way. Very low key feelings of missing that huge pulse of motivation. The really happy feeling. I've been on Lamictal for 5 years now. I can't remember my last episode. Even drinking doesn't give me much to release and trigger it. Have I thought about stopping the treatment? yeah. But when I do I get withdrawals bad. I can't breathe right...and think okay.  It's a really sad thing man. But hey, you're not alone. I miss it too."
bipolar,eudkpqo,t3_cfuoev,1563720261.0,So cute!
bipolar2,etioko4,t3_cbtae5,1562856231.0,"Meds, therapy, and art definitely help. Going out for a walk for about 10 minutes. It's the little things that help the most. With my depression episodes anyways. Don't over think, you definitely have time to get back and try again."
bipolar,eremii6,t3_c1ndgp,1560787786.0,This hits home.
bipolar,epwj6w7,t1_epwdv1l,1559577178.0,Thank you :')
bipolar,epvnqit,t1_epvktne,1559541456.0,Much love. Thank you :)
bipolar,epv58ma,t1_epv26ig,1559524488.0,Tight hugs ❤️
bipolar,epv57a9,t1_epv4nn0,1559524462.0,You too. Like the wise stranger told me in the feed. This is all temporary.
bipolar,epv0lw7,t1_epuzq16,1559521098.0,Amen
bipolar,epumnnc,t1_epu1vzw,1559512072.0,Muchos gracias. el esta descansando en paz ahora.
bipolar,epub2re,t1_epu9us0,1559506842.0,"Wow. That was a very heart felt comment. Thank you. But don't be jealous, it took me my whole life to draw like that. 

You take care too kind stranger."
bipolar,eptuj2x,t1_eptr402,1559497864.0,Crossing my fingers hard on that note
bipolar,eptugnr,t1_eptr1ic,1559497822.0,Thanks homie. Much appreciated
bipolar,eptnpr6,t1_eptk3jq,1559493964.0,Thanks. I appreciate the compliment. The tides are rolling hard already this month. Guess I just have to ride the waves :( even if it sucks
bipolar,eoc7hkl,t3_br9uon,1558454144.0,Literally me right now.
bipolar,eo8fx7d,t3_bpm9sx,1558365570.0,Just lay off the dosage a bit. Take less. I've been on it for 5 years now. I notice crying spells start to go away when you lower the dose a bit. And then go back when it's time. Being bumped up more for crying makes me numb inside.
