malaysia,fqqqbon,t1_fqmyrzz,1589570044.0,"Admittedly its my own bias/preconceived expectation in regards to what i expect historical fiction to be and how it would best be executed. Specifically i expect a modicum of realism in treatment.

Also, im not too much of a manga fan, but i do like some manga Tezuka or Otomo. Looking at bias, i would understand most manga fans would equally be turned off reading Sfar or Trondheim or Tezuka's Phoenix. 

Relatedly i dont think realism is really necessary, but i immediately feel the generic 'every person is good looking with big eyes and hidung mancung' is an immediate turn off for me, but like i said, its bias. From a technical assessment, i think the artist tried to some degree to differentiate non good looking and good looking characters and some different characters. Unfortunately, i feel its not enough. Equally to manga i think 'lowly' of any american or european comic which bandies around all generic good looking people. Its really a reflection of trying to pander to peoples general desire to buy into beautiful things only because they have anxieties of not being beautiful hence their (beautiful) cultural icon/choices inevitably validates them as being beautiful.

But thats cultural/media normalization, and if you dont follow the status quo, you wont get people to like or buy your product, its expected economics, hence youre forced to follow the status quo. As a craftsman i find that disappointing but unavoidable. Its unfortunate that a lot of manga normalizes not providing details of time and space until a spread page, and normalizes having main characters look good and non main characters look less good. So its not just one manga's fault that it does that, its what the audience expects and what the market propagates. But like i said manga isnt the only culprit. BD and american comics/disney movies also have different sets of normalizations which are and can be disappointing (if one gets too serious about it ;) ) and or work for or against the subject matter. 

Specifically about The Weight of Our Sky, the genericness of manga characterizations works against my expectations of the subtleties of a multicultural society. Even though shes potentially the ONLY eurasian in the book, in real life theres so many varieties of eurasians, you can sort of stereotypically figure out whether a person is 'pure' white, irish white, german white, a eurasian, 'malay' from kelantan, sarawak, negeri sembilan, penang, mamak, bangla/paki-malay mix, danlainlain, a chindian, tamil, punjabi, foochow, hokkien kaki ad infinitum. (i dont claim i can tell apart all those varieties). I do understand that as art/fiction a lot of creative licenses have to be exercised to make something more palatable but i feel it worked against the specific subject matter, time and space.

Dialogue wise, not much to say, i know its an international comic so it has to connect to everyone and not just Malaysians. Im just nitpicking it feels like 90s sitcom dialogue, but yes i never lived in the 60s so this is just stupid nitpicking/romanticization of something i know nothing about. Specifically what stuck out to me is i disbelieve that a girl called 'Melati' would be called 'Mel', it would be 'Melati' or 'Ati'.

Anyways i know and am glad many people do like the work regardless. I will attempt to finish reading it in the next week or so.

LetsTalkMusic,focoh06,t3_g6jccv,1587673807.0,"read half of the earlier comments , aside from specifics of money laundering and mafia connections, my most immediate thoughts are:

a) fiction/mainstream culture for the most part is a fantasy/power trip. Artists/celebrities/icons are usually proxy to something which people want. People do generally identify as the Artists/celebrities/icons/protagonist/vocalist/lead in any genre, hence any qualities which prota has/espouses, naturally is also shared/possessed by the fans

b) im trying to imagine the other side of the fence, im sure there are a lot of 'materialists' fans out there that would easily say, 'oh god this song is so pretentious (has so many lyrics and big words has so many ideas ad infinitum)'. (No im not a materialist, im a stuffy pretentious music appreciator)

&#x200B;

I think the gist of the claim against materialism isnt a music industry specific reality? Its just advertising. What im really interested in are real numbers OR some honest admissions of artists saying something of the like 'yeah General Motors gave me money to mention XXX, YYY car in my song'. The other number im also interested in is the ratio of people who werent in the least materialist BUT became materialist after so much exposure to materialist culture/music. Both statistics are probably almost impossible to procure perhaps.

i sometimes can smell imaginary scents, but i cannot do it at will, usually its linked to some previous memory. it would also be interesting to find people who can imagine smells at will.

drawing,fnbmfoa,t3_g0skgm,1586818146.0,"i really like it, i scrutinized it a bit and tried to come up with some critique

my biggest problem is more about faithfulness to an idea, here the idea is i guess the style,

\- so i have a problem with the left iris (scar) which is drawn as arcs instead of straight lines. is it intentional?

\- in relation to that, some (truthfully only one, even though there are a few of these) shapes throw me off because they have too many zigzags, instead of just being convex or concave. The specific shape im pointing at is the yellow jauneish one on the ridge of the hood next to the left eye which has a very detailed fin thing sticking into the hair. its probably a combination with the colour.

\-also in relation to that point, i do wonder about the dangling straight lines which dont meet another line. I guess having 'organic polygonal lines with occasional hanging lines' is an interesting style to explore, but if that were the case, then you didnt completely execute that. Specifically im thinking of the nostril lines and the lip line.

\-its been a while since i saw airbender or korra, did zuko have a scar(s) on his throat? the orange fillins at around his adams apple seems to suggest it.

\- i do wonder if there shouldve been more regularity of size of polygons given details of thing eg folds in fabric vs no folds in fabric.

&#x200B;

\- i really like that theres no absolute symmetry in it

\- you did a really good job on the colour cycling

\- contrary to some other comments, i like the illusion of flatness it gives

not an easy style, overall it looks good, kudos! it would be interesting to see a sequence of this zuko either talking or panning/zooming in to see how large/small objects affect the kinds of polygons you employ

incidentally, i really liked your ponyo even more, its even more abstract and haphazard (ponyo at least) and doesnt suggest any kind of flattened low poly game or stained glass"

""People who are internally driven to perform-accomplish an activity for themselves with no external reward will lose that internal drive AFTER being rewarded for that accomplishment-activity AND having that reward taken away later""

[https://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/18/1/105/](https://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/18/1/105/)

This probably reveals that the difference between motivated people and unmotivated people exists and that external rewards wont change much more so could lead to the detriment of motivated people.

The sample size of the research is too small however (56 undergraduates). It owuld be interesting to do a larger scale study on motivation in mixed social/economic demographics.

Just as how some people nowadays live for food (instead of having food to help them live) so too many people live for being loved (or feeling of being adored). But what is the real outcome-purpose of eating so much or being adored by so many? Its mainly a result-perversion of-from modern life. Modern life-culture has definitely made us 'lose sight' of why eating, why needing shelter, why loving and being loved is necessary and for the most part theyve become ends to themselves instead of for a greater goal. Hence why extremes exist in modern life.

I myself am trying to come to terms with my own future; the moment of death and thinking about what i had not done and what i still want to do, will i have regrets and unfulfilled hopes at deaths bed? What i realize is, speaking for myself, I Fear regret because im stuck in my own perception of my selfish self. But for something that you lose, someone else will gain. Obviously you will never be able to verify this because you are you and not someone else and you and i we are all stuck in our own selfish bodies. To reconcile regrets, you have to accept loss by virtue of your our beautifully limited lives. Let go and accept your life choices. For you to lose something is to allow someone else to gain something.

BUT i sincerely believe you should just tell him what you feel right now AND accept the consequences of that action.

I want to refer you to Panksepp ""Affective Neurology"" as a biological point of view, my interpretation to his work is, we want to ""Love"" and be Loved because oxytocin makes us feel good, but no i dont believe he actually makes this assertion.

I also want to refer you to Barthes ""A Lover's Discourse"" as a more humanistic phenomenological view of ""Love"", for me it treats Love, Hate, Excitement, Indifference, Faithfulness, Unfaithfulness, Joy, Sorrow and our beings as non reductive forces in the poetry of the universe which cannot be simplified to neat empirical cause and effect"
Advice,fllsjzk,t3_fpm75v,1585266864.0,"im probably the last person you should be getting advice from, but if the problem you wanted to solve was ""... but I dont want them (feelings).."" i can definitely forward you to some good reference material, mostly about the motivations of emotions etc why we have them etc etc, something reductively and constrainingly deterministic so that you can come to the realization ""oh ok im hungry its because i need glucose"" ""oh ok im excited its because etc etc"". And also procedural suggestions so as to reduce your dependence on immediate feelings or the limbic brain, eg like meditation, breathing exercises

im also going to go anal here ""real friendship/connection or if he was just looking someone to chat with because he was bored."", what exactly is real or unreal friendship? Do you actually believe that people dont seek others or things to do because of non-boredom? Can you ask yourself ""i have real interest in listening to this random band on spotify, and its not just because im bored"". If boredom is the measure of which something stops becoming real and becomes fake, then a lot of things in life MUST be unreal because i am certain there are too many people who do things purposely to rid themselves of boredom (this is probably the beginning of Unbearable Lightness of Being)

from reading the things you write im going to assume that you are quite impulsive, so im going to just say, just ask the guy and tell him the same things you wrote here ""i want him"" etc, and try to visualize yourself in 1, 2, 5, 10 years with saying what you wanted to say and being rejected, with saying what you wanted to say and not being rejected, not saying anything. Will you be content with yourself at the markers of 1, 2, 5, 10 years in the future given those possible actions-outcomes ? Life is filled with successes, failures, regrets, hopes, dont bash yourself up too much when you look back on your past-current actions in the future"
Advice,fllp38c,t3_fplpcv,1585264890.0,"what im going to say isnt going to immediately help you, but there was one research on motivation, specifically intrinsic motivation done on a sample of students the result of which was (to paraphrase) :

TLDR -> ""People who are internally driven to perform-accomplish an activity for themselves with no external reward will lose that internal drive AFTER being rewarded for that accomplishment-activity AND having that reward taken away later""

i have to dig up the authors name, i know i referenced the paper-research in some of my posts (which im too lazy to dig up right now because im indulging in r/advice procrastinating from my work!) 

that realization sort of informs my own intermittent lack of motivation or staying power etc etc if you can be honest with yourself about what drives you in the things you do then all will be fine. Truthfully if all youll be losing is money by being a hoarder and youre not too fussed about losing money, then i wouldnt let myself feel too guilty hoarding. BUT if what you feel guilty about is ""the potential that you waste with art which is stuck in your head and didnt become anything"" hen unfortunately youll JUST HAVE TO BE DISCIPLINED TO MAKE ART regardless of lack of motivation, reward, looks like crap etc etc etc

good luck! (im a musical instrument, art supply, ebook hoarder myself LOL)"
Advice,fllm11f,t1_fllkh32,1585263100.0,"i agree with you there that life isnt 'so simple' but the solution to most problems can actually be reduced to very simple processes eg ""just be X/Y/good/disciplined/etc"" or ""just dont do X/Y/antisocial/etc""

the reality is definitely ""harder"" than the things 'we say and imagine', that is the reason that youre here looking for other points of views, and if you think about that you can realize you yourself are taking the steps to solve your problems, BUT you have to realize its not an instant/overnight thing... bit by bit you will take steps and stumble and take more steps like right now, sometimes you find help sometimes you dont, and yes .... life is hard :D

but if you can stop for a moment think about that FACT, ... you are helping yourself right now ... and then ... imagine this in another year, 5 years, 10 years, maybe you wont get there then even, but as long as you never stop helping yourself know that it will continually get better...

one thing i can pick out is that you place a lot of emphasis on others' opinions of you for you to derive satisfaction and self worth and inevitably reasons to wake up every day. can i suggest  that maybe you should pick up an activity of self improvement which has no relation to others' valuations and praises and judgements? like say, in the arts or science or anything which MOST IMPORTANTLY can IMPROVE over time and give you satisfaction about becoming better at it, like playing the clarinet or learning differential equations or running marathons etc something which you can measure your improvement, because life to me is about a continuous process of being better

anyways i write too much, good luck to you"

LetsTalkMusic,fl4phby,t1_fl4cbv5,1584818513.0,"i agree, i have to be in a specific mood (not necessarily drug induced) to listen harsh music... also non harsh music, so maybe neurologically i think theres specific modalities matching system (brain) state and system input (music)

antinatalism,fkt8aqu,t1_fkt3mmf,1584509404.0,"speaking for myself i can only surmise whats best for me right now. in the end the biological/social strategy of 'bearing someone to take care of you when you cant take care of yourself anymore' makes practical/strategic sense and understandably selfish, life/manifest of life/living organism is necessarily selfish else its survival might be compromised.

but i definitely dont buy into it, maybe because i want to be pretentiously selfless.

i relate and identify to being a nihilist only in the abstract sense that value is what we create and that there is no intrinsic 'value'/greater purpose to living apart from creating more living beings but i dont think the extinction of the white rhinos (nor the human race is) are gonna change much in the (large timescale) roadmap of material existence, nor do i think its going to nullify suffering even if somehow logistically ALL the known organisms/species in the future went extinct, but thats just my opinion. 

but i agree with you; suffering IS a necessary part of being alive/existing, but i dont agree that it is a wholly useless thing (not that you had suggested that it is).

which brings me to my opinion that 'pointlessness'/'pointfulness(?)'/meaninglessness/meaningfulness, 'shoulds'/'oughts' are very much artificial constructs which humanity creates/created for ourselves and i dare say dont exist at the low level or animal/organismic(?) life. which is why i think we (myself and perhaps people who want to imbue life with more meaning than what is possible in low level organismic life) have a hard time accepting life hence we have to view life as absurd (which i personally do even after stating all that)

i think people who want to live life (meaningful or not) and continue the species should be given the chance regardless"

exmuslim,fks08ov,t3_fjzhhb,1584479586.0,"as sort of a (self skeptical) material reductionist, i might actually forward you to

1. papers relating to inflammation and depression, and the role of cardiovascular exercise and antioxidants to combat such
2. the role of oxytocin and how it makes one feel that one belongs (and comforted and safe  )
3. books about solitude, meaning(lessness) of life and existence
4. books about affective psychology, intrinsic motivation etc etc

and admittedly i have to say its not so different from the procedural recommendations of your friend. and i would apologize. i try to put myself into the shoes of your friend and yes she intends well potentially, it has worked for her and what else does she know, it has worked for her why shouldnt it work for anyone else within her group? do you want to burst her bubble? i dont know

i try to put myself into the shoes of my sister(s)/mother when they advise me to pray etc etc, and i instantly think about 'why is it that we skeptical rationalist cant proselytize about panksepp or becker etc etc etc'.... -> there is no point

if im with my sisters and if i need to pray, i will pray, if i need to say something untrue to make them feel good, i will, in the end what is loneliness and not belonging? why do we value specific people when their values have drifted so far apart from ours? is it that our values have drifted? if the rift is so far then one needs to figure out what is really important, people or values? 

easy words from me unfortunately, yet hard feelings for you, i apologize again.

i would just shrug and hug and thank her, physical comfort is important still. there are many here who will lend an ear too"
