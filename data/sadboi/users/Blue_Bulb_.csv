But, I do agree that there is a very strong possibility that she could be a narcissist, especially as it's something that hasn't just popped up and I've had to deal with since our childhood. Thanks for the advice!"
mentalhealth,fi15tni,t1_fi132jf,1582051216.0,"Thank you for this and I do try my hardest to avoid any drama in the house but when she was talking about who she thinks makes the most mess to my dad (it's SO freakin petty), I just stood there and said nothing but I rolled my eyes, by mistake and she caught onto that and then blew it way out of proportion. I tried to remain as calm as I could but when she starts she doesn't stop and she always, always gets incredibly personal. I just feel like I'm the one in the wrong again and when we argue she makes the atmosphere in the house so unbearable that you feel like you have to apologise just so you can have some peace. I've been trying to tend to my sanity a bit more by being a little more subdued when she barges into my space and rants for hours and hours and she mentioned that I'm selfish for it and that I give no one my time. Anyway, I love my family, they're all chill. It's just one person that ruins it. Will definitely be working my way to independence but it's hard being university still. As you said, I'm not gonna be a dick, stay away from the negativity, keep my head down and get on with what I need to do. Thanks for this, I was going on a mad one thinking about what she said."
