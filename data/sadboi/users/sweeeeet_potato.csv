SuicideWatch,fl9lcx5,t3_f9d5go,1584960829.0,"I have been feeling the same since my 6th std atleast. I just don't feel like living. The more I live, the more hurt I have to undergo. Others might perceive me as a successful person based on my acads and everything, but I know that I am a disappointment to my family. My mom never liked me. I tried to fill that void with many of the suitors I got. But one or the other way, I feel unloved. I feel like I am living a life of disappointment and despair. I don't wana hurt my parents by committing suicide... Neither wanna tell them about how terrible I feel living every day. But I know that they will judge me and call me crazy. Can I just erase myself from everyone'e memory and life? I wanna run away and live as someone else, a stranger to everyone."

Moreover he always says that his family will be liking me for who I am and his dad will be really proud to have me as his daughter. But he is disappointed or is anticipating that they ll mock him for not being ""successful"" upto me! This makes me furious, it's ridiculous!!!"
