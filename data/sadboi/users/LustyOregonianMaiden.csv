BPD,fn1wa0i,t1_fn1upe3,1586571639.0,Holy shit. I will always remember this example now when I feel anyway toward people on social media. Yikes.
BPD,f5to11g,t1_f5tmamt,1572461896.0,Thank you for sharing. This is great to hear!
BPD,exicce7,t1_exibwks,1566325421.0,Hey! Wasn’t expecting to have a conversation on this sub today. I’ll pm you.
BPD,exibc0x,t1_exiadbv,1566324835.0,"Breakups are never fun for anyone. 

If your feelings were artificial, then you should have no problems cutting him off.  Were you just using him or the other way around? Was he just a rebound?

I’ve had moments where I would cut off my exes. I think I would be fine without them, and I am for maybe a few days/weeks. But then it’ll happen. Either I’ll see something that reminds me of them or I hear that they’re dating/seeing someone new and it’ll crush me. 

I’ll think I don’t need them, that I’m even better than them, but then I’ll realize that I’m just devaluing them and then the idealization happens again."
BPD,exia329,t1_exi9b1t,1566324102.0,"If not romantic, then what kind of feelings did you feel for them? Limerence? Or was it more of a friendship?

I have no problems cutting off people that mean nothing to me, but when it’s a romantic partner or FWB, it hurts me greatly. 

Time could also be a factor, too. How long have they been your FP?"
BPD,exi5k1s,t3_cszbh1,1566321505.0,"BPD or not, that physical pain you’re feeling is very normal. Whether it was mutual, or you’re the dumper or the dumpee, it’s going to hurt all across the board. 

I can’t tell you whether the heartache is from
the breakup, because you miss them, or anything else. Only you could know/tell. 

How recent was the breakup? It could also be very fresh, and a fresh wound always hurts."
