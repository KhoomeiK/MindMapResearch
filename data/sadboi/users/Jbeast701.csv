Scout is made to be up in your face while Spy is made to wait for the right time. The ambi was overpowered in the sense it made spy rely on his gun more than his knife’s mechanic yes it was skilled but spy is supposed to be the one in the enemy team behind them yet one step ahead but the ambi was able to just pick off players from a distance that didn’t put spy in danger. The dead ringer is a more valid thing but the problem with it is that when you used it, it negated what the spy did like a reverse of the spy striked at the wrong time that’s their fault and they died because of it but the dead ringer allowed them to just get out and try again.
And with my argument about the Spy not being a Frag class 
A spy inherently is to gather intelligence when have you ever heard of a spy whose objective was to kill that’s just an assassin. Having intelligent is almost equal to getting a pick, yea getting a pick in the end seems better but when you can alarm your team to an Uber before they pop that could save your team without them finding out by getting shredded by a Heavy. A sentry fun up ahead and your cloaked? You can go for it and sap it or tell your team then sap and have a demo get rid of it in a few stickes.
Spy is intel and that’s even scarier than a sniper or demo because the only thing stopping a spy from find out is you being paranoid and having to still focus on the spy instead of his team 
That’s what a spy is they’re not the headshot gaining and death escaping assassin and bain of the enemy team spy is the intel feeder and paranoia raiser"

It seemed there was no hope that the buildings would burn the towers would fall and come crashing down 
with no escape from this hell the citizens ran away but some stayed to hope for a brighter day

And then from the heavens the father came and what he saw from the masters of the monsters and devils brought him great shame

He then struck a blow to the monster and devils who made anger seethe in the streets. 

The bolt made of an exploit fix and 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲𝘀

 Had destroyed the master’s plans once again and they ran in fear to the places they came for the father saved.

But then went away. To tend to his other cities and let the city recover on its own......again
