learnprogramming,fmfkao6,t1_fmfixys,1586029029.0,"So that still feels a bit confusing for me. What would the difference be between the iterative and the recursive sort? I know there's supposed to be a base case for this, but I'm not really even sure what that would be because I'm not really sure where to start. I'm just having trouble grasping how recursion would look while doing it compared to iteration"
learnjava,fm9v97z,t1_fm9u1ti,1585877348.0,I emailed my teacher and we’re not allowed to use ArrayLists as we’re going over that soon in class probably but we haven’t yet. So what would be a way to do it with a static array or some other way?
learnjava,fm9szm9,t1_fm9riwh,1585875892.0,Yeah it doesn’t say we can’t use an ArrayList but I’m not really sure how. How would that work?
Anxiety,fl2zhnm,t3_flvow6,1584764128.0,"Yep definitely. I get pretty bad acid reflux but sometimes I’ll get it even when I haven’t eaten simply bc I’m anxious about feeling sick from eating. It’s a pretty bad cycle. Eat and feel sick to my stomach, don’t eat out of fear of feeling sick, get sick to my stomach because of a fear of feeling sick"

medical,eys1osi,t1_eys18oh,1567384522.0,"Yeah I’d say my urine has been pretty dark even though I’ve drank plenty of water. It’s also had a much stronger smell than it usually has. I’ve had many of the standard UTI symptoms as well. I’ve had to go to the bathroom frequently but I’ve had to do that my entire life. But now, if I drink a bottle of water I’ll go to the bathroom around 5 times in an hour. I’ve also had trouble urinating sometimes. I’ve had the feeling of needing to go and then barely anything actually coming out."

I work in frozen foods and I consistently find anything from canned foods to fresh meats to fruits and vegetables in the freezer that people don’t care to put back in a decent spot. Or if someone drops something on the floor or knocks something over, 9 times out of 10 they’ll just leave it there"
