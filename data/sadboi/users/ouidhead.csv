Let me know if you need any more info!"
SkincareAddiction,f2xqo6e,t1_f2xgi6z,1570481410.0,Girl. I asked WHERE your getting this information you’re talking about on here when it’s literally not true at all. Yes it’s personal preference but not a truth. Caroline Hiron herself doesn’t even use physical exfoliants on her own face can’t imagine her recommending it to someone else. I would like see a link to where she recommends it because I find that funny. Here are my established and known estheticians @LaBeautyologist/ @caveofbeauty that say otherwise and who I find to be credible because of their education and articles published on this sort of thing.
SkincareAddiction,f2xfif5,t1_f2xeezt,1570477827.0,"Where exactly are you getting this information? Have you ever spoken to a established esthetician? Or hell, even a dermatologist? 

Can you list any real benefits of using physical exfoliation?

SkincareAddiction,f2xd90d,t1_f2w5h8e,1570476785.0,That’s because scrubs are bad for your face. You can most definitely get microtears.
SkincareAddiction,f2xcs13,t1_f2vywqt,1570476536.0,what is your credibility for saying that? I’m just curious because I’ve seen numerous estheticians that say differently and before I question their education I would like to know how you are so sure of this? Because my research and personal experience also says otherwise. Scrubs most definitely cause micro cuts on your skin. it’s good for body since the skin isn’t as sensitive but anything on your face is not good which is why most people don’t use that brand.
SkincareAddiction,f2xcmkd,t1_f2vvltf,1570476460.0,I don’t know why this is being downvoted so much when it’s true lmao. So many estheticians have mentioned this before.

SkincareAddiction,f2xazn9,t1_f2ws1s7,1570475715.0,A lot of people use it as a toner and then wonder why their skin feels so tight and dry and it’s because they are stripping ALL their natural oils which is what you’re not suppose to do.

Since the purpose of toners are to restore the skins Ph, finding a toner that is an humectant and contains water is better and won’t irritate the skin further. Hydrating toners are more helpful as it restores the moisture barrier. A good cheap and quality product is the Heritage rose water and glycerin."

I have been hired to babysit less than 10 kids upstairs while the parents had a party downstairs and i was paid 25/hr and kids were elementary school age and it was me and another younger girl who were watching the kids but she was being paid a lot less (10/hr) because she was younger and less experienced. She was essentially there to help me. But that seems completely unreasonable. You should consider negotiating and saying you would feel comfortable with anything from 20-25hr. especially because there are younger kids and younger kids are more high maintenance.
