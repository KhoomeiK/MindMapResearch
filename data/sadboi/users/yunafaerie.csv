ageregression,fdhxull,t3_eeye4f,1578432129.0,"istarted crying even reading some of this, I can definitely relate. i have childhood trauma (though still not certain why, but im working on that with my therapist) and growing up scares the living shit out of me. ive had so so so many breakdowns over it since i was like 14 or 15 and its been going on multiple times a week since then (im 16 now, 17 this june) i still buy stuffies and baby stuff to feel better but even when i do all of that it distresses me too. even when iâ€™m regressing, it doesnâ€™t help me like it seems to help more people, it seems to just make me sad because like you said, i know iâ€™m not actually that age. thank u a lot for making this post, iâ€™ve always felt so alone here because regressing seems to make everyone feel great, so itâ€™s nice knowing there is somebody in the same shoes as me. hopefully eventually weâ€™ll figure out why this is happening, best of luck to u <3"
