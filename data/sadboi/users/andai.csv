Yeah this made me laugh. Like, that doesn't sound like it could possibly lead to a good time. (Literally ""injecting marijuanas!"")

That's an interesting comment about it being dose-dependent. My reaction in recent years is extremely unpleasant, but it's not unlike what happens to everybody if they take way too much. And my first thought each time I have a terrible experience is, ""oh fuck, that was *way* too much"". I haven't been able to dose it properly, I'd need one of those microgram scales and that's not the kind of thing that you whip out of your pocket in a social context LOL (plus potency is all over the place with different strains)."

I thought my experience was unique (my friends certainly didn't react that way), until I started reading about schizophrenia and realized, it's a super common delusion. I'm fortunate enough that I don't have that when I am sober. I can't imagine what it must be like to try going about my life with thoughts and feelings like that constantly :(

Curiously, when my friend experienced his first psychosis and called me on the phone, I was absolutely sure that he was having a bad trip on mushrooms -- he wasn't. But apparently it started for him after taking a big bong hit (which he did regularly, with no problems until then). And today on this subreddit I saw ""who needs LSD when you have schizophrenia"". It's fascinating how much overlap there is between the two."
BipolarReddit,fr2xfir,t1_fr2sqo3,1589845767.0,"Tldr: No; Not Applicable; and Don't do drugs kids!

I have been extremely cautions with psychedelics the last few years (they work as a powerful antidepressant / wake up call, but destabilize my sense of reality). I used to take them regularly but now I aim for as little as possible (most recently leaning towards never again, based on what I've read about schizophrenia).

Back when I thought my main problem was ADHD (well... it's a close second!) and was reluctant to go on stimulants due to horrible experiences with them (feel like superman for 2 days then crash *hard*.) (and based on what I have read on stimulants and bipolar), I tried microdosing LSD for a few weeks because I've heard it's an effective treatment for ADHD. 

It actually worked incredibly well, it was the happiest and most productive few weeks of my life until that point. I cleaned my room every day (normally I clean it twice a year), I really liked the person I was while microdosing, I was more outgoing, did small talk with strangers for fun. (I have aspergers and horrible social anxiety so that kind of thing is unthinkable for me sober.) The feeling of exercising was actually physically pleasurable (normally the very *thought* of exercising exhausts me). it *felt good to move.* Unfortunately after a few weeks of daily microdosing I slipped into a psychotic depression, which was brutal, and I lost several friends over my behavior during this time. (This is roughly analogous to what would have happened if I had started taking antidepressants (without a mood stabilizer)).

So, pretty weird mix of results there eh?

That experience seriously turned me off psychedelics as a whole (at least for me -- I still believe they can provide serious benefits for most people, if used wisely (ie. once a year, very intentionally, in a supportive environment)).

As for diagnosis, I haven't been formally diagnosed with anything. Seven years of lousy therapists that didn't know what to do with me, and since then I have not seen a professional in years due to having no income. 

I've been studying web development the past few months and I'm more or less job-ready, so that should change very soon. (Though I strongly suspect my money will be better spent on massages and sessions in the floatation tank! Talk about healing.. :) 

My father had bipolar-1. I probably have bipolar-2 (based on common sense, and based on the diagnostic criteria). I'm not keen on meds though, I want to see how far I can get without them. In my case at least, the condition definitely doesn't act like ""random chemical imbalances"" -- it perfectly matches my life circumstances at each point in time. 

Depressing circumstances --> feeling depressed. 

Massive stress and pressure --> can't sleep and very energized 

(who would have thought!).

So by leveling up my discipline, my ability to control my environment (as well as daily meditation -- for those of you who read this far, take note!) I've learned to stabilize my mood. (As well as, apparently, practicing a home-made variant of CBT on myself, basically just training myself to think more helpful thoughts.)

What has been very helpful for me is quitting all my addictions. (Easier said than done!) This was extremely difficult but each one made a significant improvement to my mental health. Cannabis, sugar, alcohol, caffeine. Whenever I get frustrated at my apparent lack of progress, I only have to remember my consistent progress in this area and it puts a big smile on my face!

As for my thoughts on cannabis and psychedelics in general, I think my dad said it best: ""They can be an incredible teacher.. but if abused, they *will* bite your ass!""

Then my sense of ""where I am"" in terms of the vibe of the place I'm in begins immediately shifting from whatever it was (pretty chill while sober) to something out of a nightmare. (One time I believed the people I was with were evil wizards who had trapped me in a dimension designed for my personal suffering!)

Feels like a rush of energy in and around my body, a very unpleasant tingling in my core, like an electric buzzing. I no longer feel safe, and everything around me is a threat. I've done something wrong (broken the ""rule"" against smoking) and everyone knows it and now they're free to ""punish"" me. It actually feels like I have committed a ""cosmic crime"" and the universe itself is now against me. (The fact that it's illegal in most countries I've smoked in, seems to amplify this.)

It's a consistent theme in my THC delusions, that people around me want to manipulate and harm me. I also believe things like, they can hear my thoughts (that's a well-known delusion), they want to hurt me etc.

Curiously, I don't experience this when I'm with good friends, only with people I don't know well, or family members who are abusive to me. (And each time this happened it was smoking against my better judgment -- people I probably shouldn't be smoking with even if I didn't have any problems with cananbis!) For example, I smoked with a good friend not too long ago and it was a wonderful experience (so it's definitely not bad every time!), until I had to walk home and I got paranoid af on the street at night. 

So it seems to amplify subconscious thoughts that are already occurring. Like it doesn't make me suspect negative intentions from people who I trust completely, only people who have hurt me in the past, or who I'm unsure about. I think it's a combination of the psychedelic effects of cannabis (I have become more sensitive to psychedelics over time -- seems my brain is now more ""naturally"" psychedelic, or closer to that threshold), with the physical sensations it produces (increased heart rate --> anxiety). Psychedelics + bad emotional state --> negative thought loops --> delusion / paranoia.

Basically my brain's threat circuits get triggered like mad, and the logic circuits don't understand why and just try to fill in the gaps as best as they can. (It's been demonstrated in experiments that people make decisions in a mostly emotional way and find a rational justification afterwards -- though it doesn't seem that way from a first person perspective.)"

Re: psychosis/mania there's a thread going right now on r/bipolar about [bipolar and weed](https://old.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/gm3rzk/bipolar_disorder_medical_marijuana/).

Lots of anecdotes and a lot of research in the comments. Mostly negative.

In my own experience, everyone I know who had a psychosis (seven people), it was after at least 2 years of heavy smoking.

I know one person who had it without smoking, and one heavy smoker with no problems. Not a big sample size obviously, but I've seen some things I will never forget.

There's more and more research lately finding a cause and effect relationship (previously they weren't sure if it was causal or merely correlated).

For me, I began experiencing paranoid delusions almost every time I smoked, so I had to quite weed entirely (difficult!). I had to quit alcohol too because even years later, I would occasionally smoke thinking ""ahh it'll be fine!"" when I was drunk, and had deeply disturbing experiences.

Fortunately I do not experience delusions while sober, but based on what I have read, if I were to resume smoking or taking psychedelics, there's a very good chance it becomes permanent. And that scares the shit out of me.

The most striking experience I've had was, at a coffeeshop (the kind that sells cannabis) I met a young schizophrenic man (one of the first things he told us) who seemed quite normal and friendly, until he smoked a joint and his sense of reality disintegrated right before our eyes. He stopped making any sense and became very suspicious and agitated. We suggested that, maybe he shouldn't do that, but he wasn't receptive."

Out of six people I know who have experienced psychosis, *every single one* was a heavy smoker for at least two years leading up to their first psychosis.

They're still teasing out the cause-effect here (people who will experience psychosis eventually just seem to be more attracted to annabis) but there have been a few studies lately that found a cause-effect relationship.

The most troubling thing for me is -- once you experience that first episode, it changes your brain in a way so you experience more of them (and degenerates your prefrontal cortex each time, often leading to ADHD diagnoses, stimulant prescriptions and worse mania ...). So I have to wonder, would some of my friends and family still be alive, or still sane, if they hadn't smoked like that...

---

Personally, despite fond memories of smoking, and occasional cravings, I avoid it completely now, nearly all of my experiences in the past few years have been horrible -- and I mean several orders of magnitude worse than anything I have experienced sober or even on other psychedelics. I would not wish it on my worst enemies.

Sober, thankfully, I do not experience such things. For now. I wouldn't push that luck.

Curiously I hear constantly that people's experience of smoking is different than it used to be, less pleasant, more frequently paranoid or even delusional. Seems to be a change in brain chemistry that occurs around age 20-25, at least in some percentage of people.

My pet theory is that a lot of people are ""subthreshold"" psychotic without realizing it. They have the genetics for it, and some early signs, but nothing serious happens until they get pushed over the edge, whether due to drug use or extreme stress ( -- usually both).

What I experienced (and possibly you and parent comment) is a ""subthreshold"" form of mental illness -- while sober, the mind is relatively healthy, but ingesting THC pushes the brain chemistry over that invisible line, into paranoid and delusional territory.

A lot of people with bipolar are misdiagnosed with depression or ADHD, prescribed antidepressants or stimulants and it gives them a manic episode. Manic episodes alter the brain in a way that worsens executive dysfunction (ADHD symptoms) as well as increasing the probability of future episodes.

Once you find a mood stabilizer / dosage that works, then it's relatively safe to take antidepressants and stimulants on top of it. But not before that.

I hope you don't have it, but if you do, that's something you really need to watch out for!

None of my friends have ASD, ADHD or bipolar, let alone all three. Kinda feels like I'm living on a different planet from my friends when I talk to them about my experiences."

schizophrenia,fqaap7f,t1_fq9symr,1589215812.0,"Given the circumstances, I would advise **extreme caution** experimenting with psychedelics. They have completely warped my mind for months at a time, and caused irreversible damage to my relationships. They won't do that to everybody, but if you're already starting with a naturally psychedelic mind (and it sounds like you are), the effects will be different from you than for the average person -- and probably not in the way you're hoping for.

If you are trying to prepare for a big psychotic break, intentionally destabilizing your sense of reality would be a good way to make sure the psychotic break catches you with your pants down, and.. well, I better leave that metaphor there.

Other people will not see what you see on shrooms. (Not even if you take them at the same time!) They're not starting from the same place you are. The risks here *seriously* outweigh the benefits.

If you want people to see what you see -- a natural and healthy impulse, I might add! -- you might consider channeling it into a creative outlet like drawing or painting? Does that sound like something you would enjoy?

Psychedelics disintegrate the mind. The question is how it will put itself back together again. For most people this occurs automatically. For people who are already experiencing more than their fair share of disintegration... what will it accomplish? It would make sense in the context of, warm loving social support, and a community that can take care of you for weeks or months, nurture you back to health. Help you put yourself back together again. (That sort of thing is basically nonexistent in the modern western world) If you're taking them alone, that's like like performing a critical surgery on yourself with your eyes closed, with no training, and just hoping for the best.

Sorry to put it in such harsh terms. I say this as someone who used to be an advocate for psychedelics. Now I'm very reluctant, even for apparently stable people with no family history. I've seen them break, too.

Wishing you all the best in these difficult times."

There are some great channels out there where you can follow along on your own (I like to do it in bed or on the carpet).

For people with a predisposition to mania (including those who have only experienced hypomania), the dosage needed to cross that threshold is much lower, and the consequences are worse. (Once you experience mania, the brain alters in a way that makes it more likely to happen again. Each manic episode damages the prefrontal cortex, leading to (worse) ADHD-like symptoms.).

Non-stimulant medication is less effective at treating ADHD, but comes with a much lower risk of episodes / rapid mood cycling.

The same is true with antidepressants.

Both (stimulants and antidepressants) are considered relatively safe if prescribed with a mood stabilizer (very unsafe if prescribed without one), but even with a mood stabilizer they significantly increase the risk of episodes. So it's a cost-benefit analysis really. 

Worth mentioning that most people won't have serious problems from the combination, if the stabilizers are working right and the relative dosages (relative to the person's genetics) are right.

Not to freak you out, just to explain your doctor is cautious for a very good reason.
