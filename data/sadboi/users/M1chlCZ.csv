short,fo39igr,t3_g4xueh,1587483033.0,"I think a lot of that stems from the fact, that most likely shorter people are more energetic, they have more stamina, most often than not they are more athletic since they don't have to carry that mass, while still having pretty much same size of organs.

This manifest itself when person are in puberty, all my shorter friends was really active and competing in sports and that sort of thing, which obviously bumb their aggressiveness up, because they have to, to not suck. While me and my taller friends was more like to go somewhere fishing or making other non-sport activities.

I know it's anecdotal evidence, but I think it comes from that. Also I think that shorter people talk more loudly, because perceived height difference makes them act more dominant so they would be heard. I don't think it's conscious decision. 

Also I am not making a case that shorter person - bad behaviour, taller person - good behavior. That's obviously bullshit, but rather making my observation."

Anyway maybe we both imagine ""the line differently"" because I imagine it like people being in one line aligned to a one line not really standing how they want to and huge line (because in OP there was said 100 people in line), which is probably something like on musical events. And in that case shorter people have less exposure than taller ones. If I would cut the line in ASOT in Netherlands, I would felt more safe than on Philippines.

And by the way we were invited there by one of my friend and I don't really expacted them to be different than like it is in here and almost immediately on the airport, anxiety about being different starts to crawl on me. Also I have GF who is 6' so it was pretty weird. When we arrived into my friend's house, I felt like a Gandalf going into Bilbo's house. Not going to lie and I never felt like that ever.

I was here with a black guy in hospital (honestly first black person I talk to in here after 30 years of living here) and he told me, that he is happy in here, because we are assholes no matter the color. Well to an extent, because Gypsies, but it's tough to explain to others, that with Gypsies it's not issue their skin color, but how they act.

Built-in batteries in everything other then cardio-stimulators is just evil.

Come at me bros and sis."

ASUS,fielubx,t3_f7o274,1582380234.0,"This is why you want to move wireless connection (or soundcards) out of the reach of interference, sure even cable has it's problems, but it's vastly better than near the high frequency source, which there are many on the mother board. I recommend to even buy a cheap BT  dongle and plug them onto your USB hub/monitor. For wi-fi just buy a desired wi-fi type router and then connect it with ethernet cable. Internet is as expensive as it is for you to loosing speed."
ASUS,fiedjj0,t3_f7nvw7,1582377812.0,"Are you have it enabled in bios? Because same shit happend to me, when I was trying to turn off the stupid rainbow shit. And don't reinstall the Windows, I used one which was previously used on my intel platform and worked great. I wanted to do fresh install, but since it worked without an issue, so why bother. And yes I use it for a lot of advance programming and shit like that, if there would be some issue, I would know about it. But drivers works differently than with Windows Vista, so get up with times.

And well to be honest, my old board did not have any stupid ""RGB shit"" if that counts, but it was also Asus."

ASUS,fi3e64d,t1_fi3diy9,1582113602.0,"My issue with Aura, is that it turning itself on, on power on (lot of on's). That's BIOS issue, even though there is dedicated section on BIOS which should turn that off. NOPE. I want it to stay disabled.

Anyway don't buy into hype and stay away ,far away from AMD. Because I kind of thought that BIOS reset on failed OC (or even bad settings), reset itself on powering system on. Also no. You have to shorten the pins on the motherboard. 

And it's amazing the sheer amount of shit which you have to go through, to even OC this thing. 'member FSB times? Well it's even worse now. 

Well, but I need that parallel processing and I am not going to buy Xeon W, not the mention. To be honest, you are not saving much money, because for cheaper CPU, you are paying more for Motherboard. I hope intel step up the game. I want to go back. It's not like I have time like in my teens to play around with my PC, just so I get it going."
ASUS,fi376ol,t1_fi35wgy,1582104299.0,"I am pretty impressed how broken could high-end could be, I switched from intel to AMD (had AMD before in Athlon XXXX+ era) and thanks to internet I choose high-end X570 chipset, X570-E and it feels like some shitty old-school Biostar boards. Well look is nice, but I don't have to see inside of my PC. Despite all of that board cost almost as much as 3900X. Impressive amounts of stuff does not work out of the box, which can be partially partially blamed on AMD, but who cares for it if intel sucks now. That ""gamer aesthetic and RGB fever"" was fucking mistake. You are paying to have some cheezy shit you don't even use and it's not like there is an alternative."
