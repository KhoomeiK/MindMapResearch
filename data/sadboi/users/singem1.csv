Clonazepam 1mg up to two times daily as needed - this may be increasing as I still get horrible anxiety

Latuda 40mg  one per day but am weaning off of this due to side effects (this WAS my mood stabilizer) 

Deplin 15/90.314mg  one capsule daily - helps me metabolize my meds

Spravato esketamine nasal treatments - first month I go two times a week, second month is one time a week and then we discuss maintenance. I start at 56mg and will move up to 84 per session soon  - I have treatment resistant depression and have tried lots of antidepressants which didn't work.

I also smoke weed to help me at night to calm down to sleep. 

So this is my current cocktail. It's working so far, though I am curious to see if I need an increase in the oxcarbazepine once I'm fully weaned off of the Latuda.
