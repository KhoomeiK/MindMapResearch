menstrualcups,fk1ys5c,t1_fk1smge,1583789574.0,"This was my recommendation from PACII. I think they may have recommended the soft but I wanted the firmer one since people recommended a firmer one for beginners. I think I understand how it works now. Plus I am not on my period and I understand my cervix might drop during my cycle. I‚Äôm hoping it all works out though. Just in case, what are the longer cups versus wider?"
menstrualcups,fk0xkhd,t3_ffqcxw,1583768353.0,"New user here. Ymmv. I think most people recommend a firmer cup when starting because it will open from the fold easier. There‚Äôs a meme about nuvaring and cups and how their vagina is just a pocket for silicone objects or something, so I know people are doing that. Based on my directions from my Saalt cup technically the cup doesn‚Äôt go around the cervix like a nuvaring, but sits in the canal. Now it may migrate to the cervix and that‚Äôs okay. And whether the Saalt is a good cup or do you need multiple to rotate; I think sometimes it takes people a few cups to figure out what‚Äôs right for them but once they find their cup they don‚Äôt need multiples just the one."

bulletjournal,fhxkqfe,t3_f5awex,1581956576.0,"First I wouldn‚Äôt cover cover pages unless it‚Äôs an artistic group. I wouldn‚Äôt cover design at all unless an artsy class. I would cover future log, monthly, dailies, and collections. Collections covered would be assignment list, books to read, and a contacts list. Kids these days have everything on their phone but I believe in a hard copy of phone numbers that don‚Äôt require charging. Maybe the last class go over possibility of art, but it‚Äôs really a planner/life book rather than an art journal. You could get each of them a nice journal for $20 a piece, or a good journal and good pen. I would definitely cover and drill rapid logging. WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN. Because that will help anyone in the long run. If they‚Äôre at risk youth I would cover logging injustices to talk about with someone. I would encourage writing feelings, or if that‚Äôs depressing, logging events/conversations that causes bad feelings. 


This is just my opinions and I have no idea what to tell you.



Edit to add - only thing required for bujo is a writing instrument and a notebook. This is not a creative endeavor but i understand people like to use it as a creative outlet. If the kids are all artistic absolutely show that side, but if they‚Äôre not it‚Äôs not required."

And I was never aggressive enough for sports so just hearing you should only do these things because you‚Äôre tall made me a complete slacker because I‚Äôm only supposed to be two things I could never be?
