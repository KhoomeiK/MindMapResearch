Huh schools need more activities outside of school curriculum. I took 1 semester in dar al-thikker in jeddah and it had so many free classes you could take like robotics and volleyball and horse riding. It helps students exert the extra energy they have. 

And the current college system helps students who memorise more than actual hardworking smart students. I have seen so many people in programming classes understand nothing but manage to memorise all the codes by heart. 
It's sad since most skills learned through college become obsolete as soon as you graduate."
