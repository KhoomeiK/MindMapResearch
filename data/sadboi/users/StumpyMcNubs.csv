Because of these properties, I would imagine that taking both together could increase the chances of dehydration which might raise the blood concentration of the adderall. 

I’m just taking an educated guess here. If someone has a better answer please correct me.

I see mag glycinate is often recommended over other forms because it’s more bio-available and has a tendency to cause less stomach issues. Personally, I have yet to try it, but I know that if I take mag oxide or triple mag complex, even at night, I feel worse when taking adderall the next day.

parrots,fdr3u9n,t3_emoswy,1578679166.0,"My boyfriend and I are new to owning a bird (3mo cockatiel) also. He needs to know that his cage is his safe place, so make sure there is enough inside the cage that he can associate with “home”.  In terms of getting in and out, what has worked for us was attaching a perch to the inside door of the cage that swings out when we open the door. While he’s on the perch, it gives the feeling of security of being inside the cage even though he’s not. The perch has holes in it (Polly's Tooty Fruity Pollen Bird Perch). We stuck millet into the holes to lure him into getting comfortable with it. Now it is easier to transfer him to the perch when coming and going. Also, because our bird’s wings are clipped at the moment, my boyfriend attached a small flexible birdy ladder from the bottom of the cage to the floor. When he tires of being out, he’ll sometimes hop or walk to the ladder and just go back in. 

Basically, try not to force him into the cage. If you can, just leave the cage door open (within reason) and let him decide when he’s had enough time out. Also, you may want to consider having his wings clipped at least for now while he’s a baby. It may be easier to get him to associate his cage with being his “home” first.

If you stay at doses like that for some time, the withdrawal will be worse than the kratom withdrawal."
Drugs,epkkklf,t3_bv227s,1559275967.0,"If you can stay away from it, please do. Let me give you the run down of what's it's like having been addicted. 

I thought I could I could use it just once, but because the first time wasn't all that great I used it again. When I ran out, the craving was ridiculous and I had to have more. This eventually led to a few years of a singular mission to avoid withdrawal at least, and get high at best. This was in 2004, I was 18. 

I started shooting about a year into my habit because it just wasn't sustainable to keep snorting it. Within two years I had ODd a few times, been to rehab 6 times, been to a psych ward once, and was jailed once.. Oh, and by then had also contracted hep C. At some point, you just stop caring and almost wish for death, so none of this phased me. Somewhere along the line I also took up smoking crack and shooting coke too, because why not? I fully expected to be dead by 25. 

Around the time I was diagnosed with hep c, I was put on methadone. I tried bupe several times over but it never stuck. Anyhow, the methadone saved my life, but wasn't without its pitfalls. I was on it for 4 years, and I was off for close to 10 months and completely opiate free when I randomly decided to buy a bundle and shoot a bag over a friends house. I woke up in the hospital. I had also lost my hearing. It eventually returned to normal within a few days but it scared the absolutely shit out of me. 

I've since fucked up a couple times and wound up on bupe for 5 years cumulative. 
For a three year addiction, it has literally taken me almost 13 years in total to get back to some vague semblance of ""normal"", whatever that may be. 

I'm 33 and I've lost so, so much time to this, even when I wasn't actively using; It sucks. 

Please, take something from this and re-evaluate thinking that using once is gonna be a cool memory."
ADHD,epiksk4,t1_ephcia9,1559240390.0,I couldn't agree more. I used to get in accidents frequently while driving automatics. I was forced to switch to manual 13 years ago and I haven't been in any accidents since.
ADHD,epeyhcg,t1_epdjpna,1559188700.0,"""I'm sorry you're going through this, OP. Has your doctor ever seen you for an adhd check-up before, or has he only seen you for your yearly exam? Because he stated that he wants to see you every six months, this makes me think that this was considered your ""yearly"" and just billed under adhd check. Has his office told you that you now need to make a separate appointment for a yearly? I can understand being confused and upset about this, but the doctor did still see you and should get paid for his service."
Drugs,epccsxl,t1_epa07op,1559152736.0,Go to a dentistry school/teaching hospital. It's usually deeply discounted. The only downside is that it's time consuming.

Unless you somehow facilitated in his stealing of your parent's money, you have no reason to think you did anything wrong. You should be angry on behalf of your parents."

bipolar,eonr505,t3_bsbqpf,1558719493.0,Definitely. Absolutely. Without a doubt.
bipolar,eonqlry,t3_bsh2zs,1558719113.0,"Please do yourself a favor and find a new doctor. 

That said, I don't have a psychiatrist at the moment because of this. The last one I went to refused to complete the intake assessment when we got to talking about the meds I was on. At the time, I was on a high dose of combined benzos prescribed by my primary  (6mg a day-for years) and this guy, who I had just met, wanted me to sign over all prescribing rights to him because he wanted to take me off all benzos, yet refused to tell me how he was going to do this. He literally wished me well and showed me the door when I refused."

ADHD,eogm3el,t3_brqssk,1558560765.0,"Yep, me too. This seems to go hand in hand with my TV and reading preferences, as I get the most out of documentaries and nonfiction."
