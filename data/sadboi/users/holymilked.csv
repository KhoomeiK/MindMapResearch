JulienBaker,fpje0g4,t1_fpj09hu,1588665074.0,"This is exactly how I feel! I vaguely remember one interview talking about how TOTL was supposed to be a narrative. Although mine was not assembled in the same order, many of her songs followed my growth and represented various chapters of my life so accurately when I needed them to."
JulienBaker,fpjd7sr,t3_gdet09,1588664282.0,"I'm an 18 y/o female in NEPA going to school for speech pathology. I've been trying to teach myself music since I was 7 or 8. Now, I play all kinds of instruments and produce at home. I grew up Christian, but my dad let me stop coming to church for a few years rather than forcing his faith on me. Later, I came back by my own choice and for the past 3 years I've kept the faith.

I heard Appointments in my apple music picks shortly after TOTL came out, probably when I was 16. I didn't listen to anything else of hers until the song truly resonated with me as I started therapy. Go Home was playing in my headphones before and after my hospitalization at 17. Each track has found its way into my soul and challenges me, both musically and spiritually. A few months ago, I ""decided to stay"" and now the songs I struggled and sobbed with have become victory anthems. 

Mental illness is often a consuming beast and Julien conveys it and its outcomes so well. Her relationship with God and comfort within her sexuality are so admirable. It's hard to be bisexual in a rural Christian community, and Julien gave me the validation I needed to leave a toxic church. I was gripped by interview after interview, watching her assemble her sentences into the exact truth she was trying to speak. She's just someone who loves and loves hard. With the gorgeous ethereal sound and emotional vocals, I'm hooked. Julien Baker could easily be my favorite artist of all time. Not only do I love her music, but I'd pay hundreds for a really good conversation with her."

The helpful antidepressant qualities won't take effect for a while though. My first 2 weeks on Prozac was bouncy legs, jaw clenching, and weird dreams. But giving it another couple weeks allowed me to feel better and those symptoms slowed down and eventually went away. Zoloft made me straight up manic and that didn't subside after a few weeks so that's when I talked to my doctor and switched meds. It all depends on how your body takes it, so if you still feel dizzy after 3 or 4 weeks it's probably time to discuss another option with your doctor."

If there's no way to change what's bothering me, why do anything about it? It took a long time to rewire my brain that way but it's just how I think now.

Proverbs 22:6 says ""Direct your children onto the right path, and when they are older, they will not leave it."" I'm so glad you made the comparison about the sponge. I teach Sunday School and behind every action I make, I remind myself ""kids are sponges"" because they are. My one hour every Sunday could bring about something that sticks with them for years.

That being said, I do think it has more to do with behavior, and that's what makes the coloring book so tough. Your son wanting to color something isn't going to make him less of a man. He talks about the dinosaurs and the trucks, but will that have any effect on how well-adjusted he is later on? But, the question is if the coloring book is going to be a stepping stone to changed behavior. I think if he asked for the coloring book specifically, then it would be a nice gift for him and wouldn't be that harmful. Going out of the way to get it though seems like it might send a weird message. At the same time, as much as kids are sponges, he might not even see it that deeply. I've heard of kids watching VeggieTales for years and not even picking up that the show is about God.

The best thing you can do is model your *behavior* as a husband and father. Show him what it means to lead a household. He can probably still be a God-honoring husband and father in the future with a princess coloring book in hand.

I grew up with a boy who found a greater interest in more girl-marketed things. His often-absent father tore him down because of it and many of his peers called him gay for it. I think if his father were there to set an example and explain that his interest doesn't have to change his sexuality, he wouldn't have turned out the way he did. This boy is now 19 and still sexually conflicted. Most of that sexual conflict comes from what people *said about him* because of what he enjoyed. Suggestion is very powerful. 

So, there is no real and definite answer for the book, but this one issue also does not define you as a father. The coloring book could have heavy implications later on, or it could not. Both choices have reasoning that put the well-being of your son first.  You made the choice that was more important to you, in case it did translate into an unadjusted man later on, and I think that is okay. If you had let him have it, I would say that's okay too because you understand how much your child looks up to you, and your example would show him that the coloring book doesn't have to do with his manhood. But bringing in the example of the boy I grew up with, other people could still suggest something because of the coloring book, even if you were to let him know it doesn't have to mean anything. I think you made the right choice.

You are a great father for questioning this and seeking out guidance. Your suggestion and example is the most powerful tool you have to teach your children to be men and women of God. You know your kids and your gut feelings as a parent and God will guide you with these issues that aren't laid out in the Bible word for word."

My therapist refused to formally tell me I was borderline for the longest time because she felt the label would stunt my progress. It's not about me and my disorder, but me as a person learning skills to become more functional. Often times when my therapist needs to teach me an idea and she doesn't have a paper already, she goes straight to google. It's a helpful DBT resource but going on your own takes a lot of discipline.

As for meds, I would try to bring this up with a doctor/therapist. Everyone reacts differently to meds and it needs to be monitored closely. Essentially, meds allowed me to apply the DBT skills I had been learning for months. But it took a while to get there.

Good luck tackling this!! It's really hard when you feel so unheard."
