Rose being able to see the Candy timeline and realize she's a character in a story is one thing, but she has yet to engage in meta-textual antics like Dirk has. It also makes sense that she would be able to see she's part of a story because she's a fully realized Seer of Light, one who observes and absorbs knowledge.

I don't think anyone can know for certain whether Dave or Rose are capable of affecting the narrative like Dirk but if I were a betting man I'd say its unlikely. At least not to the same scale as Dirk."

But where it really popped off for me was when Ult Dirk showed up in person. I was expecting meta text shenanigans at the most but the way he just asserted himself into existence blew me away. I can't blame the people who despise Ult Dirk, but I really enjoy the role he plays as a villain in both the epilogues and HS2.

In the original comic they are perfectly aware of each event that would unfold which was also the case in the epilogues when she spoke to Aradia. And yet somehow they're taken completely by surprise when Jade mentions how they (Calliope) could be wrong about what would happen if she committed suicide?
