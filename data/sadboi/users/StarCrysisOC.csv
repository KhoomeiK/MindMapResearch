I’ve wanted to do this for a long time. My last song I wrote was about it, I’ve written about it in poems. You don’t know anything about me or what I’m feeling. “The Real cause of my feeling” isn’t much more than “I want to move to LA and everyone around me is supporting and helping me and my cards bear good omens”. Just because you didn’t work out, doesn’t mean there’s some “deep meaning”. I’m not one for deep meanings, I do what I do and I say what I say, there’s very little that has a deep meaning, and the stuff that does, I’m very aware of already. I know when I’m acting out as a coping mechanism, I know when something is subconsciously affecting me. I’m very glad I got into the slight relationship I did because it pushed me to make some changes, I found out my medication was making me crazy and stopped it, I decided to move for my mental health and give myself an opportunity.

My only support here is my mom (who I financially help more than vice versa), I have one friend in Florida and my grandmother lives in Kentucky. There’s no one here for me, I live poor as it is.

Because my mom randomly decided to help me, that makes the situation different? No, I made the decision after a bad situation with a guy and started preparing immediately. I have a couple acquaintances that said they’ll help me get boxes so my mom might be able to send me a few small things and help me disassemble my bed frame. What they want to do IS baseline, people do stuff like that all the time, they may even struggle from it, it may lead them somewhere different, but that’s life. If you don’t take risks, you don’t move forward to what you want to do. You just also have to think it through, plan, and pull all of your resources to make it happen. I’m going somewhere where i won’t know anyone, or have any friends. My moms friend is in Sacramento, she asked if I could stay while I found a job in LA and worked a bit there. I’m not being paid out or accompanied. This is all me, and it’s going to be just me from here on out. I’m terrified. But it’s worth trying. Trying to make you life better is always worth it.

I think it’s going to make me stronger and push my survival instinct. My counselor is helping me to plan and my mom got a friend for me to stay with when I first get there. They both know I have a diagnosis, but also know that this could serious change my life and make me happy.

Too many children are treated like burdens for “taking my life away”. Or, having a child with a horrid person then staying with that person because you have a kid together. Not saying this situation specifically, but stuff like this just brings up this feeling in me about it. 

Source: being THAT child. I’m hated for being a burden and for a long time, hated for being my father’s child (by my mom). I went through hell growing up and got mental health genes. I wouldn’t have nearly the horrible life I do, if my mom would have just thought things through; should I have a child knowing I’m going to be with her psychotic father? Should I have a child knowing I’m mentally ill? Should I have a child knowing I don’t want one? Should I have a child knowing my mental illness will be passed down, and more mental illnesses will form from the trauma of having two mentally ill parents and being abused by both of them?

I get what they were trying to go for, but when you IRL are trying to fight the good fight for people like her to be taken seriously and have respect, it doesn’t help when media paints anyone who’s unconventional as a villain. Like I said, it’s not like I hate it, or I misunderstand what they were going for. But you see it often in media, that unconventional people are to be laughed at or made out to be villains. And also, I only felt this way a little bit until I listened to the special features of season 3, it really solidified what I figured about it.

The problem is, she’s crass, she liked sex, she dresses hot, she had a hard life... of COURSE she has to be evil, she’s not pure perfect Buffy. How could someone like that be a good guy! And part of this opinion is formed from commentary and interviews from the DVD about how THEY talked about Faith. “What if Buffy grew up hard and was a bad girl, what if the Slayer had different circumstances? That was Faith”. I have a big problem with this because the show shows again and again “sex is bad” “doing what you want is bad” “pleasure is bad”, not in so many words, but in the consequences to the characters. What if the slayer was trashy?- that’s what it sounds like. And I think they call Faith trashy in the commentary. I’m like okay, I’m trashy and I must be evil, I mean, I show cleavage and like sex and come from a broken home, and wear dark clothes! I must be!

bipolar,fqwi3px,t3_glaza8,1589705231.0,"I think people with bipolar always get any negative behavior attached to their mental disorder. Women get mad, but if they get mad when they’re bipolar, it’s because they’re bipolar. Anger isn’t even a consistent symptom, it’s not one of mine. I get angry, but it’s normal anger. It’s like those memes that say “I’m happy and then I’m crying then I want to stab you HAHA IM SO BIPOLAR” when... they don’t even have a diagnosis. Bipolar is bouts of depression and mania. Yes, anger can be a part of it, but it’s not consistent with EVERY case. Those memes and anger are actually more consistent with BPD. Or bipolar WITH BPD, or PTSD, trauma, GAD, or complex PTSD. More than half of people with bipolar also have ADHD. Just food for thought.if she wasn’t diagnosed and stormed off, what would you do? Because I’m my opinion, those questions need to be asked more often. It’s too often people’s entire being become infused with their diagnosis by other people."

Although I have a real hard time getting into the shower as often as I want to when I’m home all the time, I don’t know why, this has always been an issue for me, maybe I just hate water? Sometimes I’ll be so depressed I’ll go a week. My mom has the same issue. When I was younger I was really bad with it but I’m glad that’s not the case anymore. Pretty sure it’s the mental health thing, or PTSD from my dad shoving me into the shower, or it’s just the same issue my mom has with it. It’s generally only when I’m home and not working or going anywhere though."

And I never said they had it as bad, I’m just saying that they had hard home lives too. My childhood growing up wasn’t unlike Xander’s, so I’m not trying to downplay it, but making excuses of being a shitty person because your life sucked isn’t valid imo. Idk that’s just my opinion."

Xander has the worst family, but Willow’s wasn’t perfect either, she was completely ignored. It doesn’t matter if it would have made a difference or not, that’s you talking in hindsight, not him talking when he lied for selfish reasons."
buffy,fqqjr8n,t1_fqp71z7,1589566737.0,"Didnt he graduate? You can get into many colleges without good test scores or even a GED. I thought he just didn’t get into any big colleges and didn’t want to go to college. I’ve been accepted to private schools with just a GED. His parents having no money was a bigger thing, I thought? They couldn’t put him through college, and no one in the show said anything about federal aid. So he’s just a poor person from a broken home, victim of his own circumstances and circumstances of the writers for deciding that not going to college makes you a loser and there’s no such thing as student aid. 
Not saying his character as a whole, just the college thing specifically"

buffy,fqqiqlh,t1_fqq9mmc,1589566224.0,"Because it’s different. The only way you can find out why is to ask Joss why the demon and ensouling is different between Angel and Spike. That’s the writer’s continuity problem. Angel and Angelus are two different people. Spike and William are very close. The judge recognizes humanity in Spike far before the chip. He recognizes none in Angelus. They’re incomparable, because it’s blatantly obvious Angelus is a whole other person from Angel. Arguing against the obvious because of a different situation that it seems the writers did not explain or think out is making excuses for disliking a character. Xander is wrong about Angel because Angel isn’t evil. And saying he had “bad boy” in him also doesn’t make him evil. Angel never is and never will be evil. Angelus is the heart of evil. They are different, there’s no way to explain that off. Angel still wants to atone for what Angelus did. Angel did not kill Jenny or torture Giles. But he still wants to atone for it. ....I’m a Spike stan too. Xander’s lying came from “nice guy” jealousy. He loved that Angelus was evil, because he had a shot now. He didn’t want her to know Angel could come back if she stalled, because that wouldn’t be cut and dry and get him out of her life to open her up to him."
bipolar,fqmtabg,t1_fqmkdne,1589483162.0,"I’ve tried to do all these things, I know all the advice everyone is giving me, because I’ve given similar advice, or tried to enact similar advice. I don’t want superpowers, I want normalcy. I’m 24, I’m running out of time, I’ve done nothing and every second I waste is another second closer to failing.

As for the trauma thing, maybe? I’m not just bipolar, there’s a theory I may also have ADHD (but it’s my theory, because of extra symptoms, so I’m probably wrong, I don’t self diagnose but I like to throw it out as a possibility), and I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and PTSD. Idk what trauma working out would give me, I never liked working out until a 5 month hypomanic period in 2018. The first and last time (I also ate healthy, calorie counted, took care of myself, and drank water... my 2019 hypomanic episode only had the taking care of myself part, and working nonstop at a new job). Since then nothing. Back on track though; I always hated chores, and my mom was emotionally abusive and controlling, and I was expected to do all the housework, and I was already so screwed up and not going to school etc. so I never did them and when I did it was a drag and was post-horrible hour-long fight with my mom. I’m sugarcoating for brevity. Nowadays, chores kill my upper back (especially dishes and less so sweeping/mopping). Something happened to my muscles there in 2016 so that part already makes it hard. The things I love though? Even though I’ve always loved the organization and consistency of taking care of myself, I’ve never had either of those things, my entire life. And the arts; I used to be able to get into them and making things and learn things... not so much since my addiction. 

I have a lot of trauma, but little of it is attached to anything I want to do. 

I haven’t slept since 7pm yesterday bc I’m trying to fix my schedule, and I have a tendency to rant since I’m out of my head, sorry. I’m just trying to stay awake long enough to wake up tomorrow at like 9am"

greenday,fqmq6un,t3_gjpg1v,1589481665.0,"I loved making art for this album. My first big PS CS4 projects back in 2009 we of this album.

And my first project in Graphic Design 1 was to make a black and white silhouette, so I took it further and added black and white bricks and a spray-paint look to it 

Sorry... memories lol"
