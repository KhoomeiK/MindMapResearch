HealthAnxiety,fqkmd3p,t3_gjc7td,1589430556.0,Ill wake up sweating in the middle of the night and instantly run to the bathroom to take my temp. It is not fun.
Hemochromatosis,fq8r0t0,t3_ghax0y,1589173117.0,My numbers are very similar.  I was anemic about 10 years ago but now high iron. I also took iron supplements but now for 10 years. I don’t understand.
Hemochromatosis,fpj21yy,t3_gdjgrm,1588654425.0,I have the same kind of numbers except the ferratin .  Ferratin is the only in range number. My saturation 82% and serum iron 202.  Dr won’t look into it either :/

Coronavirus,fpj16f8,t3_gdcfql,1588653774.0,"If you can do the same job at home I don’t see the point of going into the office.  They are wasting money on rent and we are wasting money on gas!  This would also reduce traffic congestion and “rush hour” in metropolitan areas like mine. 

I’d way rather be in the comfort of my own home and get snacks when I need to instead of working in an office eating whatever junk I can find or meal prepping for all of sunday.  Everything about working in an office is pointless to me."
Hemochromatosis,fpb9a07,t3_gc8shm,1588464858.0,"My saturation was 82% and my dr still didn’t want to look further into it, said it’s probably just normal to me.

HealthAnxiety,fot3e6s,t1_foszbje,1588043752.0,That’s what I was thinking but when I asked my dr be said that increased heart rate and anxiety doesn’t cause a higher fasting glucose and if that were the case so many more people would have high fasting numbers. I thought this was weird as I’ve read on the web the exact opposite and I also had another doctor say that it can increase glucose reading
HealthAnxiety,fosyg7s,t3_g922q1,1588040689.0,119 is nothing!! Mind will be in the 140s-170s

costochondritis,fopfs9m,t1_fopdayz,1587960363.0,Yes it is sore/burn it can be anywhere from dull soreness or sharp pain. Actually rowing at gym has given me flare ups badly
AskDocs,fopfe20,t3_g8rg3b,1587960082.0,Had something similar wondering the same

Hemochromatosis,fop1rt4,t1_fooyob0,1587951181.0,Thank you! We’re your numbers similar to mine?  My doctor thinks I don’t have it.. so that’s why nothing has gotten looked into further.
Hemochromatosis,folufu1,t3_g7n1lc,1587870740.0,My ts% was 82% and ferratin was 101 about 6 months ago on my last blood test.  My dr said not to be worried that these numbers are just normal to me and there’s nothing wrong with me. Now with the above post I’m very worried..
COVID19positive,fo3evsz,t3_g5g3u6,1587485717.0,Be strong!! Were you tested positive or is this your first test?
AskDocs,fo23gy5,t1_fkyv4og,1587448570.0,Hey I had mono too about 7 years ago. After that I had strep a probably 7-8 times.  My new hygienist mentioned that my right tonsil was swollen and it got me to look at it.  I noticed that the right one is significantly larger than the left.  I can’t even see the left one. Is this similar to your situation?
costochondritis,fnwz6gq,t1_fnwy7yh,1587328334.0,Yes it seems like there’s not much that can be done.  I definitely notice that ab/core workouts definitely aggravate it the most for me... now If I do them I make sure that I stretch really well before and after but definitely try to limit abs to a small percentage of my workout. I used to do full ab days and almost always had issues following that.
costochondritis,fnwxqev,t1_fnwxag2,1587327518.0,"Hmm well I have costo too and last week I was having a flare up at the same time as the lump in my throat feeling.  I’m not sure if it was from that or acid reflux or something caught.  My sister suggested that it may be something caught and to eat something that will push it down like bread.  After dinner that night, it was gone and I haven’t had that feeling since.  I hate that feeling though makes u keep swallowing and the feeling doesn’t go away.  

Also,  when I’m having a flare up Advil actually makes it pretty much go away.  Even after the advil wears off.  I think it takes down the inflammation."
costochondritis,fnwwn0q,t3_g4ce3x,1587326898.0,Do you feel the lump more after the pill?  Sometimes pills can actually get stuck on the way down.  My mom cannot take anything but a capsule or this happens to her.  That’s why if you read directions on pill bottles it will say drink with full glass of water and don’t lay down for at least 10-20 min

barexam,fnasfdl,t1_fnar4im,1586803005.0,I think they can only regrade part A which I passed.  If I get a few more points on that section my average for both parts can be passing.  You can fail a section and still pass because of your overall score.
barexam,fnamj55,t1_fnamhsv,1586800071.0,Yes through the board of bar examiners portal
barexam,fnalydl,t1_fnalihd,1586799792.0,Ok thanks.  Do you know if they regrade it and come up with a lower score on the regrade if your grade changes to that lower score?  That is my concern.
barexam,fnakja0,t3_g0jnpi,1586799090.0,I failed by 1.5 points!! I received a 134.5 and pass was a 136.  Is there’s anything that can be done / any hope that it can be appealed and changed positively without risk of lowering the score?

Sometime I’ll have random flair ups but usually the day after a strenuous exercise or if I was hyperventilating the day before.  It’s not fun to have this and anxiety combined.

I decided that I had to go into another field. I was recommended by my psychiatrist to go to all of my annual visits on time every year.  This way I can be reassured that it really is health anxiety.  The more years that odd without getting blood tests and seeing the doctor,  the more fearful we become that there’s something wrong that we just don’t know about.  I also think it’s beneficial to see someone for the anxiety, it helped for me."

AskHealth,fl2sja9,t1_fl2rppi,1584758790.0,"Hmm I mean if it were the sides of your tongue I’d say it could be from a retainer.  Do you have any dental appliances.  If you post a picture that would be helpful.  I remember about 1 year ago I posted in this group because I was worried about a white patch on the side of my tongue,  and the. I found an actual hard lump inside of my tongue.  I asked my dentist and then 2 different specialists about it.  They all said not to worry it’s nothing.  They said just make sure it doesn’t change.  When it comes to being something suspicious the first clue is if something changes with time or gets worse.  Have you looked into “thrush”.  I remember reading about many oral problems and this one is the only one that rings a bell when u say it smells"

Hemochromatosis,fkw5k4p,t1_fkw2387,1584583960.0,"I’m not a doctor but I would definitely request this given those numbers.  It seems as though high ferratin is what damage organs.  I have those high numbers like you (actually higher) but my ferratin is within normal range so my doctor said not to worry. It seems that people also don’t experience the symptoms from hemochromatosis until their ferratin is high.

What did your doctor say about those results?"
AskHealth,fkw5d03,t1_fkw4en1,1584583829.0,"It’s hard to tell sometimes.  But try to start with making a diary of when it happens:

What were you doing before it happened?
What mood were you in? 
What physical and mental sensation did you have?

See if you can separate the anxiety from the actual symptoms.  Mainly you want to know if the anxiety is a result of the symptoms or if the symptoms are brought on by anxiety.

Have you been to your doctor regarding these feelings?  Have you been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder?  I wouldn’t just write it off as anxiety until you’re evaluated by a doctor"
Coronavirus,fkw27ha,t1_fkqnin7,1584581785.0,I was wondering the same thing.  Are they referring to A positive and A negative or just A positive?

Mine is definitely related to panic and health anxiety.  Do you sort of worry a lot in general about health related things?
Hemochromatosis,fkw1q1f,t3_fkpex9,1584581474.0,I have similar number actually my total iron is almost the same.  Did he test your ferratin?
Hemochromatosis,fkw1lbk,t1_fktx1tf,1584581390.0,Thank you!  My doctor basically told me to see him next year and to be assured that it’s “normal” for me.  He told me all he can do is order a gene test for me but he doesn’t think it’s covered by insurance and would be not worth while.  I’m definitely going to see a specialist whenever this coronavirus stuff ends.  But you wouldn’t think this is an emergency right?
Hemochromatosis,fksqt97,t1_fkptkiy,1584496255.0,Well that is very reassuring!!
