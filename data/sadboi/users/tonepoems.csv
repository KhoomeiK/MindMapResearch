exjw,ffhwby5,t1_ffhvw2g,1579956835.0,"Sidebar story - 

A few years prior, we had a guest speaker from another state and they stayed with us during their visit. They had a son my age that I had a crush on from seeing at prior assemblies. We were flirting after everyone had gone to sleep, and we exchanged one kiss. I promise that's it! I was 17 at the time and didn't have much experience. 

When the idiot kid went back home, he bragged to one of his friends that we did more than we did, who in turn told the elders. 

I was pulled aside in a meeting and I explained that we only had one kiss, closed mouth, not inappropriate. They actually believed me and dropped it.

2 years later, when I'm in the DF meeting above, they actually rehashed this incident - it was IN MY FILE. They said now that I admit to having sex 2 years later, was I perhaps dishonest about the kiss I exchanged previously and maybe wanted to confess more at this point? 

My jaw still drops thinking about it."
exjw,ffhvw2g,t3_etgshv,1579956297.0,"Oooh! I can give you first-hand experience on this! I was 19 at the time. I originally wanted to disassociate myself, but my father begged me to be disfellowshipped instead (because he had hopes that I would come back eventually).

When I originally ""came out"" to my parents, I probably could have planned it better...but as I mentioned, I was 19. I basically blurted out ""I don't want to be a JW any more, I don't believe this is the truth, and by the way, I'm having sex.""

They totally got stuck on the last part. It was a whole thing that they were convinced the guy I was seeing had brainwashed me and that I was just in love, and that's what this was all about.

No matter how hard I tried to explain that they had it backwards - the reality is I had wanted out for a long time, and I was able to find someone who could help me out.

ANYWAY, but the elders didn't care how I came to my conclusion about my beliefs, but they did want to know about the sex! I was interviewed / lectured for close to FOUR HOURS. All alone, never offered a break, received a cup of water.

Questions included:

* How many times did you have sex?
* How many people have you had sex with?
* Where were you having sex?
* Did you perform oral sex?
* Did you receive oral sex?
* Did you have sex while on your period?

After the first two questions, I actually shut down and wasn't expanding on the questions like they wanted me to. When I finally said, ""This feels creepy, I don't want to answer any more of these questions"" the one elder asked, ""Does this mean you are not recognizing us as a divine group appointed to ask you these questions?""

At which point I said, ""I'm sorry, at this point, I'm feeling like you are not.""

The discussion abruptly ended there and my DF announcement was 3 days later."

“I learned a long time ago that a person can stand just about anything for 10 seconds, then you just start on a new 10 seconds. All you’ve got to do is take it 10 seconds at a time.”

So when I really struggle, I tell myself I just have to get through 10 seconds and I count down. I continue my internal voice pep talk - ""see? you got through those 10 seconds just fine, you can totally do 10 more...""

I find that the difficulty then passes for a bit and I keep going!"
relationships,ff104un,t3_er1dha,1579473962.0,"Coincidentally, when I first started dating my now husband of 10 years, we both had some housing issues come up at the same time, so the opportunity arose to move in together after only 3 months of dating. We knew it wasn't ideal, but at the time, it would have helped us both out financially.

We were both like - WHOAH, moving in together after 3 months is terrifying - can we handle this? Our solution was to spend an evening going through The Book of Questions by Gregory Stock - the questions there are along the same lines of the NYT article.

I still remember that night clearly - we were actually sitting in the car in the parking lot of a QuickTrip, sipping on soda and snacking on candy, as we tackled those questions.

I seriously think we were in the car for like 4 hours just talking the night away and getting to know each other intimately so quickly. We had a few arguments about politics and immigration, but honestly - no real red flags. In fact, it was that night that I realized my husband was more thoughtful and polite than I ever could be.

We did end up moving in together, were engaged 3 moths after that, and married a year and a half after that.

We're still blissfully in love, and I feel so content that we see eye-to-eye on so many important issues like religion, politics, finances, and just our outlook on the world.

I honestly thank that book for helping us grow together more quickly than I think we would have otherwise."

She and my husband got married when they were both 19. He came from a super religious family and they weren't allowed to live together if they weren't married, so that's what they did.

Didn't take very long before they realized how young and inexperienced they were and wanted different things from their life, but it wasn't anyone's fault and they stayed friends after their divorce.

They still text occassionally and it's always on the level, even any reminicing is as friends. The fact that he wants to include me in it or share the conversation and is never shady about it makes all the difference."

I do miss my family sometimes, but I've been so lucky to have been ""adopted"" by my wonderful in-laws who treat me like their own daughter.
