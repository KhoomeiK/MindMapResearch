I personally prefer to say bi, not pan, because the common pan definition ""attracted to people regardless of gender"" doesn't fit me. My attraction *is* related to gender expression: I have never yet found myself attracted to someone on either extreme of gender presentation (very masculine or very feminine). So while I'm attracted to men, women, and nbs, I am not attracted to all gender presentations, but to multiple genders.  Many people, especially those of us who are 30+, also like to use bi because we historically fought very hard to be recognized under that label and want to keep it in recognition of that struggle.

That said, I'm fine with bi and pan being considered synonyms, it's very very similar and nit picking definitions can be divisive, but a lot of people find using bi instead of pan nbphobic, so I explain it this way to make sure I'm not invalidating nbs. It's absolutely true that some small parts of the LGBT+ community, especially in older circles, side-eye nbs and pansexuals, so I understand why they'd feel that way."

So a simple brain scan isn't enough; they need to track what a person does over a period of time, and in a situation without real limits holding them back, like Westworld. It's why the park is necessary: several characters say that Westworld shows people who they really are, their purest essence. It tracks the kinds of decisions people make.

Here's my question: if you're honest with yourself, what, if anything, did you hope to gain by commenting what you did? Did you do it because you wanted to help your friend realize that she was opening herself up to creeps and thought she was otherwise genuinely ignorant and needed the info? Or because you were annoyed that she/her husband were complaining about something that you feel they should have expected? Or were you genuinely trying to offer advice about how you handled something similar?

Because, to me, it sounds like they were trying to call out creeps, or at worst, vent about them, and you shut them down. What exactly is wrong with them complaining the way they did, especially if they're right about the creeps, aside from ""well you should've known""? Isn't it probably a good thing if more people rail against this shit publically to make clear that it's bad? Shutting down those complaints because they should just get used to it, in my experience, does come from a negative place most of the time. 

It reminds me of how people, especially people who did one themselves, talk about unpaid internships. Like, yeah, it stinks and the system is unfair and barely legal, but what did you expect? You signed up for it! And if you wanna work in politics, you gotta know that an unpaid internship is the price of admission, nobody to blame but yourself.

They tend to agree that the system is awful, but pile on people who complain about or try to fix it. I know because I have done exactly that. I agree that it would be much better if essential entry-level positions were not unpaid! So why did I get so mad when people bitched about it? Ultimately, when I looked more closely at myself, I realized my firing back was not really me trying to be helpful, but me working out anger on the wrong people. 

So...even though you're right, posting that, especially publicly, especially in response to a venting type of post, was a little assholeish. Even if you were genuinely trying to give advice, the post was the wrong way to do it. I don't think you're victim blaming, exactly, but the real harm in victim blaming is the way it shuts down avenues for people to express hurt and frustration...can you see why it might have made your friend feel that way?"

The single best thing you can do is to stop trying to convince your mom, and to stop offering reasons for your personal choices. I know it's completely counter-intuitive, but consider: When your mom has these anxieties, how often do your reasons actually change her mind? I suspect not very. That's because you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into in the first place. 

 So you need to stop Justifying, Arguing, Defending, and Explaining (or JADEing). This acronym is usually brought up in context of dealing with narcissists, but I think it applies in a wide variety of social contexts. The basic idea is that, by offering reasons, you open the door for debate that is either impossible to win (if the person you're talking to is irrational) or inappropriate in the first place (if it involves a subjective personal issue that is none of their business).

[Caveat: there may be times when it *is* safe to engage in dialogue with your mom. I trust that years of experience have taught you to recognize when your mom is in an anxiety spiral vs when she is genuinely curious.]

Let's say for example that, a year from now, you're about to move out and have found the perfect apartment for you. Unfortunately, your mom thinks the neighborhood is far too dangerous and demands you find a different place. First, you Justify: it's close to work, and you really need an affordable place right now, and this fits the bill. She shoots that down with ""you can always stay with us for free!"" Next, you Argue: the neighborhood is actually not that dangerous! You even have statistics to prove it! She counters with ""my friend Barbara's daughter's roomate was attacked there! The government statistics are phony!"" Then, you Defend: you tell your mom you are just trying to be a real adult, that you can make your own decisions, that she's being ridiculous. That's when she hits you with the ""how could you hurt your poor mother like this"" routine. Last, you Explain: the apartment complex is gated. The windows are barred. The streets are well lit. She has a counter to all of these. ""What about the other people who live in the complex--they could be killers too!"" ""If the neighborhood was safe, there would be no need for barred windows!"" ""People get mugged in broad daylight every day!""

No matter what you do, *you can't win*. Like fighting a hydra, for every anxiety you cut down, a new one will spring up in its place.  Remember, *reasons are for reasonable people.* The only option is not to play. Instead, give simple statements of fact. ""Thank you for your advice, I'll think about it, ""That's interesting,"" ""hmmm..."" and so on to deflect. ""That won't be possible,"" ""this isn't up for debate,""  ""no thank you,""  etc for when you need to be firmer. And you have to sick to it--intermittent reinforcement is a bitch.

I'll leave you with this: if you're feeling guilty, remember that this isn't good for her either. She gets her anxiety momentarily soothed, but at the same time reinforced because, in giving in to her, you basically confirm that she was right to be anxious in the first place. Disengaging is better for both of you."

Vibrant colors, elaborate embroidery, you name it, to show that you were rich and fashionable. But for the past few hundred years, flamboyance has been associated with women and gay men. 

That's why only Ser Loras is the only man who gets to care about fashion in the TV series. Jaime can't be put in flashy embroidered stuff lest  viewers associate him with (gasp!) The Gays. Costumers worry that modern viewers don't really see silky red, black, and gold as sexy on a man, and Jaime has to be sexy.

It's not that bread and milk are somehow especially good for snowstorms, just that they're staples people might run out of quickly.

However, it's also common for people in places where it rarely snows to panic and stock up if it's going to snow more than half an inch--Atlanta and DC are good examples. That's the actual joke here: people panicking over moderately inconvenient weather."

bisexual,felvwwo,t1_feln0yg,1579232263.0,"It's not weird/unusual, lots of people feel that way, but I do think it's worth considering more *why* you feel it. What specifically about surgical reassignment bothers you? Would you feel the same way about, let's say, a cis man who had a penile implant after a severe injury? Or a cis woman who had had a breast reduction/augmentation or mastectomy? If not, then why would a trans partner be any different?

I think it's possible to have transphobic tendencies without being a bigot, and from personal experience it sounds to me like your ""ick factor"" (at least as described in this post) might have a little bit of hidden transphobia in it. I'm definitely not here to call you a bad person--lord knows I felt like you did, and worse, when I was younger. You have every right in the world to only date/bone people you're actually into! But for me, these feelings were coming much more from the dormant (transphobic) fear that it was somehow unnatural than a real sexual preference, and once I educated myself more about trans people, that went away. 

For me, the ""would you feel the same way about a cis man with a penile implant?"" question really opened my eyes. You may still feel the same way after thinking on it, but still do think on it."

relationships,feh2owd,t1_fegw2ub,1579107894.0,"I'm also curious to hear...OP, what's your love language? And does he provide it in its most intense form for you literally every single time you see him? Like, if gifts is your love language, does he give you some kind of gift (material or otherwise) every day? If quality time is you love language, does he have an activity planned or highly engaged conversation with you every time you speak, as in, does he literally never just veg out on the couch with you? If it's words of affirmation, does he give you a little speech about how much and why he loves you every single day?

People have taken to using love languages as a trump card any time they want something when, in reality, they're simply a useful (and unscientific) tool for helping people connect.

My point is that, like this poster says, having a certain love language does not mean being entitled to its highest expression every single day. If you were refusing to hug him or touch him at all on the regular, he might make a case, but...you're not.     Even if he really does need to have sex daily, that's not a sign you don't love him enough."

The youngest Millenials are now 26/27 and the oldest Gen X-ers are 52/53, so young Millenials' parents are often older Gen X. But the oldest Millenials and the youngest Gen X-ers are literally one year apart. Generation math is weird and imprecise.

The show is addressing that. He wished not to lose her meaning that he didn't want her to die...but djinns are literal bastards. The dragon tells us Geralt didn't want to lose her, and Yennefer says at the beginning of the episode that she and Geralt keep bumping into each other, like she can't shake him.
