technology,fniu7fd,t1_fnhkg88,1586986438.0,"The Chineses are not allowed to insult their government or say anything against it, their main social media (Weibo) and all others has to follow “internet safety guidelines”. So basically things like “Taiwan is a country” or “President Xi is shit” would be removed and sometimes the person posting that would have to bear some kinds of responsibility.

The CCP also teach Chineses to love the country (more like the CCP itself), not matter what the country does. Anyone insulting the CCP is seen as insulting their god, and anything the CCP has done, those people would find excuses and justify. Wildest comments I’ve seen includes firing in Tiananmen massacre is the only option the government had because China only just united, they had to reimplant the traditional thoughts of being Chinese and not those rights (freedom of speech etc.) that the westerners believe in.

They think that worshiping the government is what everyone does hence why they criticise other governments thinking that others will be offended. Never did they thought that it only makes os happier, thanks for helping us criticise our shit government."

If you are looking to moving up the social ladder, that’s probably impossible in any existing political system. The only exception is communism where there is no division of citizens by social class.

The ideal situation would be, even the poorest are rich enough to support their living expense and afford luxury. In this case though luxury would be the same if everyone can afford it. If there is a way of moving up the social class easily I believe that no one would want to stay at the bottom. Why would you want to."

HongKong,f3o9q9k,t3_dhierh,1571012112.0,"The Chief Excutive of Hong Kong introduced an Extradition Bill (more details can be checked here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_extradition_bill), the bill itself doesn’t have any explicit problems, but the legal system in China, the CCP would charge you of crime you did not commit just because you are a “risk” to their control of the country, people are HK are relly against it. The government decide not to consult the public, instead they wanted to pass the bill quickly, so people stood out to protest on the street. The protests were peaceful in the beginning but the police force has been using excessive force against protesters, which made protest escalate. 

During the whole period (June~now) they have been mass arresting protesters, and now people on street who wear black, mostly in support of the movement, even when they have not broke the law, or cause any harm to the police/public. In the police press conference, they always find excuses for everything they did, try to cover up police who breaks the law (and many of them did), whilst in China the government covers up facts and uses fake news to keep control of the public opinion up in China.

In September, the number of “suicides” in HK have been record-breaking, and there is a trend to it. Males jump off buildings and females are found dead (some are naked) in the sea. Amongst those who jumped, some have NO BLOOD STAIN, where he jumped. What’s more: many of them are wearing black. 

The most controversial one is a fifteen year-old swimmer. She actively participated in protest, and went missing on 19th September. Her body was later found naked, in the sea on 22th September. There have been rumours about police rapping arrested female protesters, and the police have been said to have raped this girl and murdered her. However the police force said she committed suicide but no suicide note was found, and there is no trace of rape on her body. The body is cremated on 10th October after the police claimed that her family agreed that she committed suicide and there is nothing suspicious about her death. 

There are five demands raise by Hongkongers (HKers) and all of them are yet to be fulfilled. I don’t think there would be a stop to the protest in the forseeable future as the ultimate aim is to fight for democracy in HK but the CCP doesn’t like the idea.

Sorry for the long response and my bad English."
