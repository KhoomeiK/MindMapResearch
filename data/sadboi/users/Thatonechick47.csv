Because of my past, I have a tendency to let shit like this fly and it took my boyfriend and my mom finding out and pressing me to report what he was doing for me to put a stop to it. My boss came and talked to us and he just sat with his head down trying to seem innocent and ashamed but continued to act inappropriately until I quit.
