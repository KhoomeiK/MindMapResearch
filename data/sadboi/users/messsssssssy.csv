My obsession is house fires. I had a psychotic depressive episode last year which combined w my OCD. it was horrible. I was also living alone at the time. I turned off the heating all winter!! Freezing cold. I thought the devil was after me and wanted to burn my house down. 

When I saw the neighbors left the lights on I set a timer to wake me up every 30 mins in case of fire. 

It got better when I got roommates."

bipolar,fi7pqxb,t3_f4xopj,1582225895.0,"unfortunately all my serious depressive episodes have been like on average 6 months. I had a depressive episode (that at points became psychotic) from 2018-2019 that lasted over a year and honestly I‚Äôm not fully sure how I survived. For part of it I was living alone too I was not on meds bc I was undiagnosed but here are things that helped ensure my survival/recovery. 

- support system is everything. Im lucky to have friends who really stick through it with me even if my family doesn‚Äôt. also had a system in place with one of my friends wherein if I had a really bad night / was feeling suicidal I could stay over at hers. forcing myself to do things with them sometimes was the highlight of my life   

- good therapist / professional help. If you feel like you have a shitty pdoc change if you can. It makes a huge difference. 

- I think this one saved my life: I don‚Äôt know how it is where you live but the healthcare system is very strong in my country. I did an outpatient program when things got really bad. Essentially I went to the hospital for a ‚Äúmental health check up‚Äù every single day for like 2 months. (Still in school and everything) If it was clear I was doing badly id spend a night in hospital. theoretically if I was in a really dark place that would lead to hospitalization. Also I was able to schedule these nurse appointments pretty short notice whenever. 

- do what you need to do to survive. I‚Äôm just a student I know this might be super different for a new mother. But essentially all I did was go to school go home and do the absolute bare minimum. I would have lost my mind if I‚Äôd have put more pressure on myself. 

- and ofc the basics. sleep. Routine. self evident. stay away from drugs/ alcohol. Minimize stress if you can. 

- don‚Äôt get angry at yourself. As someone who only has long episodes I‚Äôve come to learn how to keep faith against all the odds. If you don‚Äôt believe in God then just have faith in the passage of time. It has to end eventually. Just let it if you can. Do your best to get better but also accept it might not be ok for a while and sometimes all you can do is let the wave carry you if you get me. 

- these days I go to a support group for mood disorders? Makes me feel less alone. Worth looking into. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. the long episodes are absolutely horrendous especially in your situation. in my case I‚Äôve always found that it seems to get better the exact moment I feel like I can‚Äôt go on. Just take it day by day. Things do get better. you will feel like yourself again eventually. <3"

I greatly admire her and she is a v special woman. Artistic/creative but sometimes not emotionally present. (Moon in Pisces) We would make great friends probably. I love her very much. But at times she shows signs of narcissism or bpd. Emotional issues of her own. Before I moved away relatively young we almost had a sort of symbiotic relationship which lacked boundaries. 

Interestingly, as a child I had severe OCD and my obsessions were related to losing her. (Pluto = obsessive , compulsive tendencies) 

I often find myself torn between my rage and love when it comes to her. I don‚Äôt know how to explain. Maybe it‚Äôs because my Pluto is conjunct Mars."

2) I cut out sugar and carbs cold turkey. The more carbs you eat the more carbs you crave. (Has to do with insulin) I did the keto diet (which is high fat low carb) for a while and have been low carb (but less strict) since then and I don‚Äôt have cravings anymore. 

3) exercise. There are studies where they‚Äôve proven it helps cut down binge eating. 

Ive realized since that my ‚Äúbinge eating‚Äù was really a sugar addiction. I think this is the case for many people with BED.

I get what you mean about wanting to live a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. It used to worry me a lot as well, but honestly, 6 months ago I nearly lost my life to this disorder in a horrific psychotic depression and since then my priorities have changed drastically. I guess you‚Äôre at that turning point as well.

cutting down on drugs/alcohol is definitely important. I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs possible to be stable if you‚Äôre drinking/doing drugs.Sobriety is tough but it‚Äôs made me feel a bit more stable (not necessarily  emotionally comfortable but stable mood wise). It‚Äôs not ‚Äúfun‚Äù but neither are mixed episodes lol. 

As for the rest, it‚Äôs pretty obvious stuff they tell you over and over: therapy, SLEEP SCHEDULE, take your meds , exercise , nutrition. There‚Äôs really no magical trick to managing ur mental health. It sucks lol and there‚Äôs no way to make it fun. 

It‚Äôs hard esp as a young person to go to bed at a certain time and not to do drugs or drink. Ik.

Personally, I suspected I had bipolar for a long time before I was diagnosed and it didn‚Äôt come as a surprise to me at all. It‚Äôs a different experience for different people.

It wasn‚Äôt a moment where I acted weird which made me realize, it was more of a pattern that I could trace through nearly my entire life, of moods and behaviors.

Again, I‚Äôm not a mental health professional but it sounds like to me it‚Äôs just stress and a natural reaction to being in a new environment? Being more sociable and not being able to sleep by themselves don‚Äôt really scream bipolar given the situation you‚Äôre in. 

It‚Äôs not that it couldn‚Äôt be a sign, it‚Äôs that you need more than that to actually be considered bipolar.

He seemed like he was having a manic episode and I just wish there was less misinformation about this illness. If people on the internet and around him had been more aware maybe the discourse around it would have been different before his death, instead of his audience making fun of him. 

It just makes me really sad."
bipolar,etr7bm6,t3_cd3fb1,1563114176.0,hang in there ...I feel you bc I just came out of a 7 month long depression.
bipolar,etqxx1y,t3_cd2an5,1563106488.0,"I got addicted to nicotine through vaping lol during my exams I was depressed and it was the only way to stay alert. I weaned myself off it after though. I have no time for that. 

Also got addicted to sugar (but idk if that‚Äôs strange) in my early teens before I even knew about bipolar and I think it had something to do with my emotional ups and downs."

If your dad is an otherwise nice person you have a good relationship with, calmly talking to him about it seems like a good idea. It may be hard to get over his pride though. If he reacts really negatively and after continued attempts to talk doesn‚Äôt want to stop, I think you just have to accept that this way of acting is his coping mechanism and that you personally can‚Äôt change him, so maybe emotionally distance yourself from those comments, and learn to stop seeking approval you won‚Äôt get. It‚Äôs hard but worth it.

My dad is like this too, but it‚Äôs because he is a narcissist (NPD) ((I‚Äôm in no way implying your dad is. There‚Äôs a lot more to it than this behavior)) and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. little by little I just stopped telling him about things because I really don‚Äôt need an attitude like that in my life."
bipolar,etq3jxn,t3_ccwy02,1563071644.0,"I‚Äôd say wait until you‚Äôre sober / not hungover in like 5 days and see how things look then. I find that especially wine depresses me for a long time after I drink it. 
I was in your position just a couple of weeks ago and today I am so grateful to be alive. I know what it feels like trust me. 
I know it‚Äôs clich√© but the literal nature of the bipolar condition is that no state of mind is permanent. Soon you‚Äôll be looking back on this moment. 
And if you‚Äôre truly indifferent choose life because you might as well. Death will come eventually anyways just not right now."
bipolar,etq20r7,t3_cco82v,1563070404.0,"the important thing to know about bipolar depression specifically is that it is the brain recovering from the manic episode, so it will have to run its course. from personal experience with manic episodes, he's currently probably being eaten alive by his own regret and remorse, and honestly I don't know what you can say to him to make that better. psychotherapy is probably the best bet. 

Crucial : getting the right medical attention from a psychiatrist. Because he clearly is suicidal possibly for a time inpatient/outpatient care. In fact, in view of the living situation he is in,  inpatient for a short time is probably the most ideal for his own safety. it is not comfortable but sometimes necessary if you think he'll hurt himself again. 

As for what you can say/do personally, I think the most important thing is accepting that he will be this way for a while, and all the unpleasantness that will probably come with that. very very important : don't let him isolate himself. People with depression love isolating themselves but this can slowly destroy them. try to show empathy and understanding wherever and whenever you can. and if you don't understand don't try and act like you do. 

I remember when I was at my lowest point there was a friend who let me sleep over whenever I felt extremely suicidal. no questions asked, no judgement, just understanding and acceptance. it was this little act of kindness that showed me how much she cared and little things like this from multiple people kept me going. it didn't stop the depression but it made me less actively suicidal. 

&#x200B;

this is all from my personal experience with bipolar 1 but everyones different of course. this sounds like a really complicated situation so I hope it gets better eventually and that he recovers and gets his life back on track."
bipolar,etpxst5,t3_ccq2rw,1563067324.0,"ive only had one manic episode where I was straight up delusional. the rest just made me reckless, super confident and restless. I get hallucinations when im depressed and manic but they only started after a pretty intense phase with weed."
bipolar,etpx2bp,t3_cctq0z,1563066801.0,"I go through the same, hallucinations for me are the most terrifying part. In my opinion  rapid cycling is truly the worst. hang in there you're not alone."
bipolar,etpwwn5,t3_ccwcjl,1563066688.0,"I struggle with this as well. I also often don't really know how to deal especially the intrusive thoughts about health/death. the thing that has helped the most is calling a friend to have them explain things to me rationally or going for a walk outside and doing breathing exercises, or having a ritual like making tea every time I feel that way and convincing myself it helps."
bipolar,eth1svv,t3_cbolmh,1562803827.0,I have it very severely when depressed. It feels like I can‚Äôt concentrate and have no train of thought basically. I hate it. It‚Äôs hard to read and I constantly dissociate.

bipolar,erkfnv4,t1_erj0lsp,1560962418.0,Thank you this was really reassuring
bipolar,erhryzz,t1_erhqwos,1560881605.0,"Never realized I was manic while I was manic lol but it was pretty quick. I started smoking for the first time in May (like once a week) by July I had full blown delusional mania. (And the mania continued even while I took a break from smoking for like a month) By September I had  depression (continued smoking) , 

I sought help specifically for bipolar like in the December of that year after I‚Äôd processed everything and realized what had happened. 

I stopped smoking the following July 

and two years, one hospitalization and an outpatient program later, I got my diagnosis finally."
bipolar,erho69t,t1_erhdav5,1560879278.0,"I never sought help for weed dependence if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. I stopped smoking by myself bc I stared having terrifying panic attacks and hearing voices when I smoked. 

And for the rest I was in general psychotherapy ‚Äúgetting help‚Äù long before I started smoking."
bipolar,erh3j1o,t3_c1ydut,1560866213.0,I have the same thing. Gets really bad during episodes. Idk why it happens. I‚Äôm not super paranoid in general but I have severe anxiety. Idk what to do about it except I notice it‚Äôs easier to live with if someone else is there with me. (I live alone usually).
