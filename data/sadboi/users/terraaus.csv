Another was I was to attend an Amway meeting in another city and drove there with a sponsor. We arrived at the district manager’s house where we were supposed to spend the night. Their teenaged children let us in and showed us to our rooms. Said their parents were at a meeting and would not be in until later. The sponsor and I went to bed. In the middle of the night the sponsor received a phone call that the parents were in an automobile accident. The mom was killed and the dad was in the hospital in critical condition. We had to wake up the kids and give them the bad news. I had never met the parents or children before. Never saw them again."

She was an English major though and has worked in Hollywood for a number of years, though on the business side of entertainment, not on the creative (acting) side. When Tara saw the script she chose to audition for the role of the countess, not the role of the maid. The director was stunned by her performance and had trouble believing she spoke as both characters. He said she has an excellent command of the English language. She was hired for the role of the countess."

I have had several episodes of this in my life brought on by prolonged stress. However, in my case, it has been temporary and I go back to looking like my normal self after a period of time, usually in 6 months to a year, if I take good care of myself. Depression and emotional upheaval seems to be a part of the symptoms. 

Do what you can to alleviate the stress in your life. I drink hot decaf teas and take hot baths to decompress. I pay attention to my diet. Caffeine and wine would aggravate my symptoms.  I also take vitamins and mineral supplements to build my immune system. Check out Bach Remedies.  Be kind to your body, love it, and thank it for still being here to house your soul. Things can get better. I am living proof."

If you do not need the money, why not donate it somewhere in your mother’s name? Maybe to a homeless shelter where you would be helping other families?"

Now that she is planning to become a part of your family she might feel a sense of entitlement to the store your Dad manages. This situation will be awkward for everyone for years to come.

KitchenConfidential,f4ty9aq,t3_dlq7kl,1571795228.0,"I recently went to work at a retirement home. The residents told me the previous food looked and tasted like crap. Another chef started at the same time as me. We changed the menu to be more like hotel food. We popped the meals with colorful salads and sandwiches, added flavor and garnishes to the entrees, added pretty sugar-free desserts. We also added some dishes popular in the past that they fondly remember. Music from their era plays in the background (50’s and 60’s hits).The residents are so happy and they continually thank us. Appetites have improved and many of the residents who used to stay in their rooms and not eat much, now come to the dining room. They are happier and communicate with each other more over shared meals. It feels great to add more enjoyment to their last years. This is an area  where you can be creative, and make a real difference in the quality of people’s lives.

Your resume can detail the changes you made and the effects it had on the residents. It is also changing the bottom line of the retirement home, as now more residents are signing up to stay there."
