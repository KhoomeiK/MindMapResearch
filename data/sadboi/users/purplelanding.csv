relationship_advice,flei5bj,t1_fleho9t,1585084847.0,I do want them back. I just can’t stand this anymore. I didn’t do anything to deserve this and I certainly can’t understand why someone would rather straight up ignore you and try to ghost you over trying to talk to you and make things right with you. I can’t fathom it. This is essentially all over me wanting to maintain distance for a bit because of the whole coronavirus thing.
relationship_advice,fleh0bc,t1_flegla6,1585084218.0,"Nah, I’m done. I’m not playing games. I shouldn’t have to fucking do that and torture myself for a “week or two” wondering if someone even cares, if they will or won’t reach out, what they’re thinking and if they’re doing anything behind my back. I’m 23. It’s time to grow up and communicate like an adult, and that doesn’t include the silent treatment. If you care for me and want me to be in your life, then show it. If not, I can’t beg. I’ve been waiting it out for the most part, but it’s been 4 days and he’s been liking weird quotes and watching my stories on instagram, and hasn’t said a word."

relationship_advice,fla654o,t3_fnba99,1584977454.0,"In my opinion your tone towards your girlfriend makes it seem like you think only your view on this situation is correct and valid, and that hers wasn’t even worth discussing or considering. You try to convince her against her view saying that it is a deal breaker for you and that she has to be the one to conform to you. I get your reasons, but have you considered that it may also be a deal breaker for her? Have you considered that she, too, wants the best for her children?

Not only that, but you invalidated her childhood experience in which she thinks she may have gotten an illness from the H1N1 vaccine. This is not to say she definitely did, but its hurtful to completely invalidate somebody’s experience like that. She is the one who lived through it and probably has some sort of intuition on her body/experience. Modern day science is limited and is not the end-all-be-all of truth. This is what many people fail to see. 

You should have tried to discuss it with her and reach a compromise or at least a fair debate, not shove your views down her throat and expect her to change them otherwise it is a deal breaker for you. That’s jarring and hurtful, and also kind of condescending in my opinion.

Plus what she is saying about Trump using the virus as a way to win the election is valid. You also have valid points."
relationship_advice,fla3wel,t1_fl9fc1z,1584976071.0,"I don’t see how wanting the best for your child and wanting to make sure not to harm them at their most natural and vulnerable states is considered parental narcissism.

This is where “anti vaxxer” and vaxxer parents have in common. Both want the best for their children. 

Your degrading tone in this post tells me enough and is extremely off putting. Have you ever done research into the other side? Have you ever given it a chance? Have you ever tried having a discussion instead of disregarding people based on a label associated with terrible stereotypes? Probably not.

There is a healthy medium between the two views. One comes from a distrust of government/big pharma (valid) and the other comes from the opposite."

I totally get being upset about it too. It’s honestly not even like I wasn’t going to touch him at all though. We still touched. Just makes me feel like the love is conditional based upon physicality. I sometimes wonder if deep down he’s just given up on the relationship and that’s why. Like I’m not worth it for him.

Plus there isn’t really a rule that says you HAVE to completely delete people from your past just because you’re with somebody. He sounds jealous, or insecure, and that’s more of a him problem than a you problem. If everything else is good and he wants to break up over this, that’s...I’m not sure what to say. Maybe its an excuse for him. Either way I’d try to really confront the issue and ask him to explain why it bothered him so much, how it makes him feel, and address those concerns one by one while reassuring him. But if he’s going to act emotionally immature when it comes to other issues, i.e: telling you he doesnt care why and that its childish of you to not delete it, then a long term relationship with this person might not be worth it. He’ll just treat other, possibly larger issues the same. 

Edit: I read more of your post. It says you already attempted to do that and he didn’t hear you out and basically wants to break up over a misunderstanding. That’s incredibly immature. Just let him go. Otherwise he is probably the type to guilt you so hard that you will shrink yourself trying to meet all his desires for him to “stay with you” because he is so insecure. Sorry that you’re going through this."

I’ve known this relationship is unhealthy for a while and probably not destined to last. We both care for each other a great deal. I don’t know. I feel really stupid for this. On the outside it seems so easy, just leave. Let both of each other go. To me it doesn’t feel right doing so.

Big ego and little emotional maturity is a big no no."
relationship_advice,ffp0115,t1_ffoxoi9,1580083823.0,"I wasn’t trying to tell him how to buy it. I sent him a pinterest board I made that was a “wish list” board with pictures of cute stuff I’ve collected, for him to maybe get ideas or an idea of the “aesthetic” of things I liked because my birthday is coming up. Gift giving is one of my top love languages. It makes me feel loved when people get really unique/specific/meaningful things for me. 

When he expressed he didnt like it and felt the way he did about it, I apologized to him in the moment and told him I didnt want to be telling him what to get me either, and that I didn’t want it to be like that or trying to control what he got me.

If only I could show you guys screenshots of the way he communicates with me when I try talking through issues with him, you guys would be able to understand my perspective. But I dont want to share screenshots online, plus its too much effort. At this point I’ve not only went to go talk to him face to face, but been texting him all day today apologizing multiple times and showing him I understand, but he doesn’t want to talk about ANYTHING else. He straight up told me that he didnt “give a fuck about any of this other stuff” when I was addressing them, and only wanted a genuine apology and for me to show that I felt bad about it and that I would “make it up to him.” Well I did give him a genuine apology and showed him I understood, but he didnt accept it. He just keeps acting like he was so wronged and how I “dont care.”.....Meanwhile I’m trying to tell him that I have legitimate concerns about the relationship and about certain things revolving the events that took place, about my side of it, but he doesnt wanna listen or own up to anything.

He won’t own up to the fact that he ignored me back. I was telling him about things about communication that he does that aren’t right. Especially on Thursday when we spoke in person, because he was getting very emotional and heated. He JUST said something to me like “what fucking communication? you didnt do it when i brought up how i felt.” And I told him, except I owned up to that already that it was wrong and apologized already about it, but that he wasn’t owning up to anything himself. And he just goes “Good” “Now learn from it.” Are you fucking kidding me? And you guys wonder why I thought he was ignoring me to show me a lesson or prove a point, despite him saying otherwise. It feels to me like he keeps trying to divert from other issues by claiming how hurt he feels from all this and how he can only listen to an apology, and even then it wasn’t good enough for him when I basically wrote massive text messages to show him I cared and understood. I’m about to lose my mind here. It seems extremely manipulative and one sided to me."

It makes me feel like I can never really talk to him and I always have to keep up the peace. I want to be able to talk to him mutually but it never is that easy when I try, when in my mind, it could be.

I dont have an answer because it’s hard knowing if this is the time to walk away, if you’re trying to water something dead or not, or that this is just the way he is and he can’t help feeling as emotional as he does by things, and I need to just give it time and show more remorse before we can talk about things in a constructive manner."

relationship_advice,ffixcks,t1_ffiuvt5,1579985018.0,"I feel like the only real advice on this thread was telling me to reach out, or telling us that we both should talk face to face. I already did that. Besides people telling me how wrong or difficult or insane I am or telling us to break up.

I already apologized to him about ignoring him like that for a day and admitted it was wrong of me to do that and acknowledged how it made him feel, but I had genuine reasons for doing so and for feeling the way I was which points to larger and long withstanding issues between our relationship and the communication within it. Instead of giving me understanding, or constructively talking about the issue, he could only focus on being emotional about it and saying how it’s too late, how i’m so wrong, and that it won’t change how he feels about what happened, and he kept going back around to telling me I dont give a fuck or I dont understand when I did, and I tried to tell him that many times but it wouldn’t get across. Because basically he doesn’t want to hear about *why* I did it since he still feels so hurt about the situation himself. And furthermore, he keeps telling me he would NEVER do that to me, ignore me like that when nothing is going on, meanwhile he has ignored me in the past like that too and done similar things to make me feel really hurt, disrespected, like he didn’t care about me and lost my trust the same exact way. But he says its different because its when we are fighting. But I’ve almost never been allowed to make this big of a deal about it or get a real apology. He rarely accepts it if it’s something **I** feel wronged about. So it makes me resentful that he cant see that meanwhile he’s treating me like I wronged him SO BAD by ignoring him for an evening to the point where we didn’t speak for a week and we still are barely speaking and we don’t know how to communicate about the issue/are trying slowly to. It basically feels to me like for now I have to swallow everything and focus on how I wronged him and making up for that until we can actually talk about my issues with him / the general issues within our communication. It doesn’t feel fair or healthy.

I dont think there’s a point trying to clear the air, it might just make things worse, bc I don’t think he knows either right now."

And tell him that if he wants to see or be a part of his daughter and your life, he can make the effort from there. 

He is definitely abusive and you definitely deserve better. You don't need him. He doesn't do jack shit to help you out, anyway.  You're just an empathetic person, thus easy to get stuck in situations like this.

I think that based on how he felt and what he wrote, that you should take those feelings as what they were. Especially because it was on a reddit thread, so he was venting about things that he's kept hidden inside of himself. They may have been passing thoughts for him, but I think that if your intuition tells you something is off and you can just feel it in your heart and in the air, then trust it.

He probably doesn't want to lose you or hurt you, but if you think you can handle it, you should sit him down for a serious talk and ask him how he really feels and tell him to be honest with you without worrying about the reaction.

I don't know what to say. I know it's really hard to let go of people we love, but you deserve someone who feels like they are *in love* with you and feels that you are special, everyday."

relationship_advice,ffd4xdc,t1_ffd4lwh,1579813494.0,You guys also fail to point out the fact that the way he talks to me and treats me is horridly wrong

I was bringing it up to ask for advice, fucking dickhead. To ask if he responding would be giving into his “manipulation” if that was the case, or not.

He's a hypocrite. Not I. I ignore him for an evening and he ignores me for days on end because it's apparently so upsetting to him to be ignored, despite him doing it to me for years now."

relationship_advice,ffcjekf,t1_ffcichv,1579800729.0,"I want to be with him. He's smart, he's driven (even if sometimes that means putting himself first), he's really sweet (when we're not fighting), he's perceptive about people in his own way, he's actually really sensitive (which is hard to put up with but makes me love him more because I understand his emotions and his reactions and see what he tries to hide inside). We are in similar industries/fields, we have similar values and goals in life, we DO have our differences and aren't perfectly compatible, as you can see, but I the bond and closeness that we do have still means something to me. I feel like he is the one person I can talk to about most of whats going on in my life and do the everyday mundane things with without being uncomfortable or putting on a face."
relationship_advice,ffciuhp,t1_ffcid0j,1579800395.0,No obviously not. In an ideal world we'd be past these petty communication issues and be married and raising a family together and getting along. But maybe we're just too incompatible.

I agree this is probably partially how he is feeling. I also feel the same way though. I don't want to end it, I don't think he does either. So.."

Oh yeah? These are the only two options? How about instead of ""put up"", he also realizes that it's wrong to stone-wall / ignore / hide from serious discussions and issues in a relationship an a mutual effort is made to be better towards each other while communicating? I'm not even being combative, I agreed with you. I'm just trying to give you full perspective. I objectively think I am a better communicator than he is (not saying I'm perfect), and this inability to just talk and hash issues out before it drags on and becomes larger has been a long standing issue."

""Are you breaking up with me"" or ""I dont care"" or ""I dont want to talk face to face."""
relationship_advice,ffcg70b,t1_ffcfnc4,1579798768.0,">Basically, I think your issues boil down to your communication styles. You’re someone who can quickly process your emotions and feelings and be ready to discuss them right away. Your bf takes longer, sometimes days, and he’s not great at communicating “I’m not ready to have a discussion yet, please give me more time to process everything.”

Very true.

I shouldn't ALWAYS have to be the bigger person. That is my point. You said it yourself, all the emotional labour should't be on you. In the past this is how I've felt for so long, and THAT'S why I just didn't have it in me to even respond that night. But me responding within a day does NOT equate to him not responding for a week. Who is really more immature here? He rarely himself asks me for time when he is stone-walling me. He recently started to be better about it but it's usually ""Im not dealing with this anymore tonight. I'm gonna go game "" or ""I have more important things to deal with"" etc"
