it‚Äôs just really crazy to me because this week is teacher appreciation week. my AP delivered a sign outside of my house sunday saying ‚Äúan amazing educator lives here‚Äù and gave me a card thanking me. the next day they tell me i‚Äôm out of a job. it‚Äôs so confusing

i put my heart and soul into my work and i miss my students. i won‚Äôt get to say goodbye to my 5th graders. i‚Äôm not even allowed to email any of the kids i worked so closely with. it all sucks and i‚Äôm so disheartened by the way my school has treated me as disposable"
