I don‚Äôt want to get preachy but with things closed down now is a good time to reflect on what is so scary about losing someone in this way.

dating_advice,fokgl0l,t1_fojvavh,1587841679.0,There are guys out there that also think in this ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù way about getting to know people. I am all for appreciating physical attractiveness when appropriate but without an attraction to someone‚Äôs personality it isn‚Äôt gong anywhere. It‚Äôs just culturally expected for men to make the first move. We sometimes don‚Äôt get the opportunity to decide whether we are down to talk to someone we are attracted to because you usually have to take the chances you get.

dating_advice,fokejq0,t1_fojw5co,1587840605.0,It‚Äôs not that simple. It can feel kind of devaluing to being referred to only by your physical characteristics.
dating_advice,fokefwg,t1_fojq5kk,1587840547.0,"You‚Äôre necessarily wrong about what you‚Äôre saying but there can be other reasons why this is happening. Some people are just so starved for affection that it isn‚Äôt easy to delineate what part of it is making them feel so good about themselves. The confidence boost from receiving that sort of attention may be outweighing any idea of objectification. In a perfect world where everyone is emotionally adjusted it may have come across to them as more objectifying. 

Perhaps they suffer from feelings of low self worth about their appearance and so this sort of attention scratches a special itch for them. Perhaps compliments on appearance are the only compliments of consequence they have experienced in their adult life and so that‚Äôs their default for explaining what would make them feel special. I‚Äôm not saying these are explanations for this specific post but I definitely think the explanation you gave is making an overly narrow interpretation of the issue. 

Personally, I would be over the moon about a compliment about my personality. Given what how often I get complimented I would still be quite happy with being called ‚Äúhot‚Äù even if it might leave a bit of stale taste in my mouth."

I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong about guys but I feel like you‚Äôre kind of doing the same thing to yourself here. I wouldn‚Äôt want to refer to myself as  ‚Äúregular‚Äù because my looks are only a small part of what sets me apart and makes me uniquely attractive. 

On a separate note, a lot of men choose partners based on looks which isn‚Äôt super healthy. They internalize all this crap from media and other guys telling them that the attractiveness of their partner is part of their own worth. It‚Äôs fucked up and it‚Äôs hurtful to the guy just as much as the women he isn‚Äôt properly adjusted to appreciate. It‚Äôs not an excuse but it‚Äôs where a lot of it comes from."

dating_advice,foka6rt,t1_fojynra,1587838272.0,"Maybe what they‚Äôre trying to say, and may be wrong, is that because men are expected to make the first step it also tends to put us in a position where we are expected to ‚Äúprove our worth‚Äù in the same situation. You have to be on your toes not to get rejected by the automatic filter many women seem to have to men who approach them. That being said I think this is an archaic stereotype that oversimplifies both the men‚Äôs and woman‚Äôs experiences but I think that was what they meant. Maybe they are also commenting on the nerve wracking nature approaching can have for many. 

Or they actually feel like there is a need to ‚Äúwalk on eggshells‚Äù which isn‚Äôt very well adjusted. Of course this can be through no fault of one‚Äôs own such as a bad parenting situation or abusive ex but it can also just be from being an asshole."
dating_advice,fok93i6,t1_fojjo7q,1587837692.0,You are totally not wrong but there is disparity in genders experiences. The asymmetry of the comparison IMO comes in when you look at how guys are expected to approach culturally. Guys can end up in the unfortunate ‚Äúnumbers game‚Äù situation where they‚Äôre having to approach many  women for each single chance to share the actual value of their personality and whatnot. It definitely contributes to the toxicity of the whole thing. I tend to stay away from cold approaching women for this reason.
