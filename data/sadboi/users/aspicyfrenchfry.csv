The county shelter in my city isn't a kill shelter fortunately (mainly because our local sheriff is against it, partially because there are several foster based rescues in the area that can pull animals and place them in foster homes if county gets full). My rescue will often pull most if not all the cats (we sometimes rescue dogs but we mostly rescue cats) from a ""kill"" shelter two hours away as often as we can. 

I'm definitely not against someone adopting from a kill shelter as long as the dog/cat is going to a loving home."
