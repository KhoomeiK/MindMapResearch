If you‚Äôre uncomfortable, and he doesn‚Äôt care that you are, then I guess it more important for him to like her pics rather than make you sure you are comfortable. Lol. That‚Äôs silly. A good man would be like oh hey that makes you uncomfortable okay I‚Äôll stop. Don‚Äôt change your comfort levels in order to feel okay with it.

I have been easily woo‚Äôd too many times and my last bf had a few of these qualities that I didn‚Äôt even realize would be an issue until soon after I‚Äôd already moved in. As someone who eats very well and exercises regularly, I didn‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôd be an issue to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt, until later on. All of these resonated with me though.

Funny thing about it too, is that I am 24 and he is 36. I was woo‚Äôd by how funny he was, empathetic, romantic. I came to learn he was drunk for all of that... I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking.

Recipie: avocado smashed with a bit of lemon juice, chia seeds, basil, salt and pepper. Stirred in sundried tomatoes. All atop toasted Daves bread (super tasty). Topped with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast, some more sundried tomatoes, and pine nuts. 

Side is just some cucumber slices with salt, pepper, and DILL!! I love dill and it goes great with cucumber. 

This meal is definitely high fat, though it‚Äôs healthy fats. If you are aiming to eat low-fat, this may not be the meal for you."

The family loved me and I think I got the job. So things are already looking much better. Being poor and unemployed has caused me to feel incredibly guilty and bad about myself.

BPD,f3bpe5e,t3_dgai4m,1570814360.0,"I know it‚Äôs incredibly hard but you have to try to stop comparing yourself to others. It‚Äôs something I also struggle with a bunch, you just have to keep pushing to do things that you love every day. Something small to make yourself feel better and preoccupy your mind. This could be any kind of self care, maybe even volunteer. Maybe you could take 30 min every day to practice a skill that you already have or would like to have. Whenever you catch yourself comparing yourself to others, remind yourself that life is not a competition. It does NOT matter what they are doing, the only thing that matters is YOUR happiness. Focus on you! You are your own individual person. Forgive yourself for anything you‚Äôre still harboring, and just focus on being better than you were yesterday. All of this is WAY easier said than done, but this is what I try to do. Every morning when you wake up, drink a bunch of water and try to say positive things to yourself. Small steps every day can make a huge difference in your life. 

You can do this! Fuck BPD! DO NOT let it tell you what you can and can‚Äôt do. It is the biggest liar and you CAN get through this. Say a big fuck you to BPD and tell it to fuck off when you start getting thoughts like that.

I used 1 cup of mayo, threw a bunch of fresh and dried dill in there, and squeezed half a lemon, salt and pepper. Stirred that up and put it on the salmon along with some thinly sliced lemons and baked at 450 for 10 min. For the roasted carrots, I just used olive oil, salt n pepper, and dill weed. Thew the carrots in the oven about 5-7 minutes before the salmon. Took both the carrots and salmon out at the same time. All I added to the couscous was salt/pepper and some of the sauce I made. I ended up making too much sauce and not even using it all, but you could use it all if you like. Was just trying to keep the meal light.

I typed this up poorly for you guys, I apologize! I‚Äôve never written a recipe before and because I didn‚Äôt follow one I was unsure how to proceed."
