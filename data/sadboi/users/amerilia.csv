In the end, I was telling myself some really shitty things and had a very negative self-image that was so core to my being. I also had to validate my feelings (regardless of good or bad, right or wrong) to get to that point. I confronted shame and the reasons I respond to things in certain ways. 

It was (and still is) a lot of hard work and is still painful, but I'm making progress to start and love myself and others around me. 

I've been specifically analyzing myself and going through the books of Brene Brown. We used her book in a shame resilience class, and I've been going through the rest of her work since.
