Then what i would do( but youdont have to do it in this order or at all if you want. )
 Look at spices see what is used regularly and whats not ever used if they arent used get rid of them. 

Spice you canput it by either alphabetical but i think i would organize it by most commonly used and not commonly used. 
I would get the cans and put them all together on a same shelf or same area. Separate them into stuff like beans, sauces . basically group the alike.

I see you have choclate chips, if you do baking put your baking stuff together. Get a bin of some kind to make things easier to keep together. Then you can label it baking or baking stuff or whatever you want."
