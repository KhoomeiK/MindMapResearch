epidemiology,fo3o8ux,t3_g58mdb,1587490212.0,"Hey there. I'd like to echo some of the comments I've seen below. 

One of the biggest differences between an MS and MPH are the skills you're going to learn. An MS is going to be more focused on research design and analysis, where as an MPH has more programmatic components. When you're talking about Epi however, it's always going to be analysis heavy. 

An MS is likely to lead you down the research hole, which as you mentioned, often leads to academia. However, there are plenty of governmental roles that need researchers as well.  Some examples of where you could use an Epi MS in non-academia fields would be: water quality surveillance for a government agency or monitoring zoonotic disease for any level of government. There are probably tons of examples, but those are two that stick out to me (because they're my field). However, if you want to lead/design research I'd say you're going to be better off with a PhD whether you want it to be more analytical or programmatic.

Without knowing more definitively where within Epi your interests lie, it's difficult to point you in a specific direction. Hope this helps!"

I'm sorry you're struggling right now, and I know how frustrating it can be when your university isn't as supportive as they should be. I'm a PhD candidate and I struggle with somewhat severe PTSD. I have a couple of suggestions that might help! 

Does your school have an office of student services? These people often act as advocates for students on multiple fronts. It can range from students with  disabilities getting the accommodations they need to connecting students with support services they aren't currently getting. They might be able to both help you get connected with a therapist at school or in the community sooner rather than later. They may also be able to help you get some temporary academic accommodations. Even if all you need is one assignment deadline to be extended, it might be just the help you need to get adjusted again. 

I'm not sure where you are in school (I'm US) but my abysmal student health insurance doesn't cover much in the way of mental health. Hopefully you have access to something better, and might consider speaking with a provider outside of the school? They may be able to see you faster and for longer term care that the school is able to offer. 

Lastly, don't be afraid to reach out to professors. I am NOT suggesting you should tell them you're suffering from PTSD or go into a long backstory. I AM, however, saying that it's okay to say things like ""I'm struggling with the pressures of the quarantine, and am working really hard to maintain my high academic standards"". They are likely willing to help you out in ways you wouldn't otherwise receive. 

Getting a graduate degree is hard work, incredibly stressful, and emotionally draining without the added demands of a pandemic and PTSD. I empathize with your situation, and you're not alone. Please DM me if I can help in any other way.

(SARS: 14%-15%https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/) (MERS:34.4%https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/)


According the CDC's most recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6908e1.htm) defining a case-fatality rate within the US is on the current ""to-do"" list. Keep in mind, most of the deaths and cases here have been elderly/immunocompromised, so that rate is likely to seem high, when in reality, we just have fewer people becoming symptomatic or contracting. 

The CDC has also put up a really great webpage of up-to-date info about CoVid-19. There are printable fact sheets written in excellent language, frequently asked questions, and a section regarding current appropriate concern levels. They emphasize there that the likelihood of a person in the United States being exposed is currently very very low. It echoes the messaging of ""be aware and cautious, but don't overreact"". 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/related-stigma.html

Hope this helps! Happy to answer any other questions."
NewOrleans,fjgky3w,t1_fjfgaf2,1583329500.0,"That's a valid question. I am personally not highly concerned primarily because of the disease severity and mortality rates. A vast majority of cases are exhibiting with very mild symptoms. Yes there is vulnerable subpopulation in which the disease seems to sometimes take a firm hold, but this is not a majority of the total population, particularly in this country. While I can understand everyone seeing/hearing what appears to be a pretty freaky transmission rate, it's important to remember where that sits in line with other well established diseases, and our responses to those. If disease severity were as high as smallpox, measles, or even SARS or MERS, AND we had the transmission rate of coronavirus, my level of concern would definitely be several ""notches"" higher. 

There's a second aspect to your question I'd like to address: about how epidemiologists or other risk comminicators might ""seem"". First, this government and their scientific contractors have a duty to protect the people of this country. They will ALWAYS exhibit more caution than less because that's, by definition, the safer choice. Even with cancer causing agents, it only takes an estimated (and I mean basically a guess) risk of about 1/100,000 people for systems to get put into place to regulate that exposure. It's the safe route. Ultimately, risking panic or abundant caution is better than lack of preparedness. Additionally, scientists (epidemiologists in particular) I find are abysmal at scientific communication. We get stuck in our stats and numbers, and don't do people the service of really describing the practical meaning of them. That being said, I think it's easy for the general population to look at something a epi said, and not get the entire picture. And to be clear, that's the fault of the person speaking/writing. 

Lastly, one of my epidemiologist mentors, Dr. Susan Hassig, is going to be giving an online talk today about ""behind the numbers"" of this epidemic. I'll post the link when I find it. I find her to be very sensible, intelligent, and a good communicator. Her opinions may or may not parallel mine. But my guess is she will advise that people stay aware and practice good hygiene.

The west side of the park is far less visited. The Bowen Loop is about 20 miles through the Never Summer Range and is moderately challenging and very scenic. watch for bighorn sheep! 

Another great longer hike is a one way from east to west (or vice versa) from Bear Lake to the North Inlet trailhead. Once you go over the pass take the extra hike up to Lakes Nokoni and Nanita for some great views, possible moose sightings, and nice isolation. 

The Colorado River trail is a little bust to Lulu City, but after that you'll have it to yourself. It's far less scenic, but it's very peaceful.
