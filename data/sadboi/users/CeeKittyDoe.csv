BPD,fq59abt,t3_ggucuz,1589096850.0,"I'm sorry he said that to you and hurt your feelings, and probably also triggered your anxiety. I can tell by your post that your still feeling very hurt by this, so my suggestion is to put it aside until tomorrow and revisit it then. 

It is not okay for him to lash out at you for having feelings that he does not necessarily agree with. We don't always agree with our feelings either, but that does not mean they shouldn't be acknowledged and explored. I've found that with BPD and most other disorders that stems from trauma, there is no such thing as OVERreacting, only MISreacting. Sometimes our brain takes a shortcut, and tries to explain a feelings in ways that don't make sense and aren't rational. That does not mean the feeling isn't real, but the reaction might be misdirected. When that happens (or you feel like it might have)  it's always wise to take a step back and leave it until the next day and ask yourself again: Was I directing this anger/fear/sadness in the right direction? Sometimes the answer is yes, sometimes it's no. 

It's important for your boyfriend to realize that if you don't want to share, that is alright. If it's important you'll share when you're ready. I also want to point out that if he knows about your diagnosis and the very specific fear of abandonment that comes with it, what he said may have been a very nasty manipulation technique, pending on what you said before him. There could be many reasons why he did this. Maybe he was hurt by what you said? Maybe he was trying to point out that the thing you didn't feel was important is important, and tried to use your relationship as something else that was important to make a point (in that case, not a very wise rhetoric twist, but sometimes people do dumb things)? Or maybe he just is not a good and caring partner. This is up to you to find out, I guess. 

I'm glad you reached out to us, and I hope this wall of text did anything constructive. I hope you guys figure it out, and I wish you all the happiness!"
BPD,fq2960t,t1_fq0p20u,1589053953.0,"I'm really glad you feel better! I just feel like once you're served BPD as a diagnosis, you're also served a myth that you will never have a healthy relationship and that you will always be a burden. I find that to not be at all true. Everyone brings something into their relationship. My thing just so happens to be a personality disorder, while my husband for instance is not very well trained in cleaning the house or doing things he don't want to do. Both can be bothersome, but it's always possible to work through things. 

I don't think either of us really knew how to handle it at first. In the start he just let it run its course. We communicate very well and very openly, and have worked hard for it. The thing that I think helped us both the most was that me and my therapist included him in my treatment plan, so he was aware of what to expect and sometimes joined me for sessions where he was free to give some pointers to how this all seemed to him. 

We've tried to establish a safe space in our relationship, where we're both very clear on the fact that our relationship held hostage in arguments. Its never at stake, which makes it much easier to bring up problems for the both of us, and it makes it easier to listen as well. It's been hard work, but he's always been very patient with me. My diagnosis has never once been brought up as something that inconveniences him or burdens him, but rather when I act certain ways or say certain things he can point out that what I'm doing is hurting him, just like you would with any other party. I'm held accountable, and that has been both the hardest part, but also the best part.

Most of the progress I've made completely on my own, but it's absolutely key that your partner supports you. You deserve a supportive partner, and should never settle for less, even if that means giving up someone you love in the process. I've done that as well, and I'm all the better for it now. I hope you get an in-person appointment soon, and that you get good guidance!"
BPD,fpyn5wu,t3_gg44i0,1589006596.0,"Remember that while getting a diagnosis is scary, it's not a label but a tool to figure out how to help you. Regardless of the diagnosis, your symptoms are the same as they were before. Now you maybe have a name for it, treatments to try, and a way to recognize why things are as they are. 

Getting a diagnosis can be a big grief for someone, and that is completely fine. Your feelings of being scared are completely valid, but that does not mean you have a reason to be. You will be fine. Your symptoms do not define you. You are worthy of help, treatment and guidance. 

I opt for transparency. I would tell my partner, but I don't tell everyone. My close family, my husband  and my closest friends are aware of my diagnosis and had helped me through it. Some have not been as understanding, and they're gone from my life now. It was horrible as it went on, but now I'm all the better for it and surrounded by people who love me for me. They are patient when they need to be, and they get firm with me when they need to be. 

If you do not identify with your diagnosis, ask for a second opinion. Therapists can be wrong. And while a personality disorder isn't treatable as in it likely won't vanish forever, there are a whole bunch of treatments that help people handle their symptoms or even become completely free of any symptoms. You can still have a wonderful life with stable relationships and a stable mental health. It just may take some work. 

Good luck, hope to see you around here! This is a good place to ask for help. Remember to be careful to not use it to enable dangerous or reckless behavior, though.

PS: I started dating my now husband at 19, right around the time I was diagnosed. We've learned together. It's been great!"

But a normal day for me before surgery would usually be chilling at home or going to work, because of joint pain and exhaustion after work. Now a day for me consist of yoga, exercise, a walk, and I'm putting some effort in to most of my meals. Just today I did yoga and exercise for over an hour, went for a walk for an hour, made an elaborate dinner and a hot lunch, cleaned out my closet and vacuumed our entire apartment. I would NEVER have done that before surgery."
gastricsleeve,fpcfp0k,t3_gcey5e,1588498847.0,"I'm not even three months out yet, so I don't know all there is to know yet, but I'll try to make somewhat of a list of what it's been like for me. 

CW/TW: Trauma and eating disorders 

1. I really appreciate this opportunity to both lose weight and get to reconnect with my body. I'm a trauma victim and I've previously had a restrictive eating disorder (in my teens, before I gained all the weight back in recovery). Through that I learned to absolutely ignore every signal my body was giving me. This surgery had forced me to feel my body and listen to it, good and bad. It was really difficult and uncomfortable at first, but now it's very peaceful and nice. I've taken to do yoga, and I'm interested to learn more about what this body can do. 

2. I don't always feel great. I do have some reflux that is being controlled by medications right now, but it causes my stomach to become kind of foamy sometimes and that leads to some nausea. Vomiting is NOT a nice experience post-op. Since I used to be bulimic and I've always handled getting sick really well too, so I didn't expect it to be so uncomfortable when I got sick, but it's actually absolutely dreadful. At least there's no chance I'll ever relapse. I never want to vomit again. It's horrible. 

3. I'm weaker and I have way less energy. I frequently crash if I push myself too hard. Currently I'm working on regaining my strength, since it's still early in the process. As I mentioned, I'm doing yoga, I'm doing strength exercises a few times a week and I try to go for a walk at least five times a week, and always spend a little bit of time outside. I'm not nearly as active as I aspire to be. When I over exert myself it's a very new sensation. My entire body becomes really heavy, my nose gets stuffy, I get dizzy and nauseous and my throat and chest starts burning. It's like I go from fine to ABSOLUTELY exhausted in a second, with little to no warning. So far I've realized it happens more often when I go for a walk and then go to the store, so I try to limit my activities to be one of those things instead of both. I am getting better, but I would not be able to to back to work physically. ""Luckily"" COVID has me locked up inside anyway, since my place of employment is closed. 

4. My pains are mostly gone. Getting up is so much easier. Walking uphill is so much easier. My muscles don't become inflamed nearly as much as they used to, and my psoriasis is way better as well. I'm thrilled about it. I generally feel healthier. It just feels good. 

5. I'm constipated. It sucks. 

6. My skin is super dry and my hormones are going CRAZY. I had my period for three weeks right after the surgery and then I broke out like crazy. Still am. Also, my hair is falling out. So a good skincare routine and remembering to get those vitamins in are absolutely vital. 

7. I am very happy. All of the things I've described that are less than ideal are barely even bothering me. Writing it, I'm surprised it's not bothering me even more, but honestly I just feel so good. Moving is so much easier, eating healthy tastes so much better, and so many pains I didn't even realize I had are just gone. Sometimes I can get overwhelmed by the urge to eat something I shouldn't, but I don't indulge like I did before. I can have an ice cream and eat some of it and be like ""eeeeh not what I expected"", and pawn it off to my husband. It's nice to learn what it feels like to want something but then changing your mind. 

All in all, you do what's best for you. All bodies are different. You may not have any of my problems or any problems at all, or you may be one of the unlucky few that have nothing but problems. It's statistically very unlikely, but you need to be sure it's a risk you're willing to take."

You'll reach plateaus and even gain a little and then you will go right back to losing out of nowhere. It's a wild ride, and I'm grateful to explore this together with my body, instead of ignoring it like I would have previously. 

I have to agree with whoever said that you're not as ready as you think you are. I have prepared for years and I knew exactly what to expect and I still had no idea. It's just completely different, good and bad. 

I don't ever want to go back. I wish I knew that before, so I could have some peace of mind the weeks before the surgery."
BPD,fp1f5a2,t3_gaoaxf,1588233437.0,"All of this 

I have a friend with BPD (as well as having the diagnosis myself) and accepting this is so important. Of course we all screw up. I've hurt people both intentionally and unintentionally, and I've been manipulative both intentionally and unintentionally. I'm no better than anyone else, and I for sure have bad days and weaknesses as well. The difference between me and her is that she idolized the parts of BPD that can be damaging to others, and spends a great deal of time doing nasty shit and messaging me stuff like ""Oops BPD made me do it"". That's never an excuse for shitty behavior, at best it's just an explanation. 

People who are hurting have a tendency to lash out, and that's fine. We all have, both while completely unaware and sometimes while way too aware of what we were doing. But we're not supposed to be held to different standards. That's not doing anyone any favors.

This is something you have to be prepared for when you choose surgery, and honestly a lot of people aren't. The risks are small, but there is always a risk for complications of major surgery, both right after surgery and long term. Knowing you have tried what you can on your own is absolute key, as well with knowing and coming to terms with what you're risking.

loseit,foa0bsz,t1_fo9w00d,1587636381.0,"For me the difficult part at first was that food TASTED the same-ish, but the taste did nothing for me. Likely because of the oxytocin you're talking about! It was super weird, and really hard to get used to."
loseit,foa05wn,t1_fo9eygl,1587636234.0,"Yes, and no. It makes it easier to keep the weight off for the first year or so, and you get a tool to help you. It's however way more difficult in other ways, that luckily I prepared myself for and thus I knew it was coming. To give a few examples:

1. The 2-week pre-op diet OP described was 4 weeks for me. I was completely fatigued. 

2. Almost three months out from surgery, I'm still fatigued if I go for walks that are too long or I'm not very particular with what kind of food I eat. If I don't get enough protein I get really sick really fast. I had two weeks of violent vomiting and feeling extremely sick and not being able to eat anything because of not getting enough protein. Eventually I had to force myself to eat. 

3. It's extremely difficult to stay hydrated and still eat as much as you're supposed to. I've spent a few months being dehydrated, and now that it's getting warm it's getting harder. That's a rest-of-my-life-problem. 

4. I'm a trauma victim, and the hardest part for mehas definitely been having to reconnect with my body. While losing weight without surgery, I could just ignore signals like hunger or cravings along with all other signals I've been ignoring from my body. After 10-15 years of trying to lose weight, relearning what those signals are is pretty difficult. Hunger isn't hunger, and being full isn't being full. I now have to listen to all signals. Luckily I did a lot of the mental work before surgery, some people are not as lucky and thus the first months or even the first year is a living hell. 

5. Weighing in the risk is extremely difficult and scary. I'm sure some people do the surgery because they think it's easy, but I personally was never solely motivated by just the number on the scale, but health and the thought of the future. If it was only the number on the scale, I probably wouldn't have had surgery. But when there are more people than me and my body weight factoring in, like my husband and our ability to have a family, and my future children and the life I want for them, the risk was worth it for me. I spent three years making a decision that was right for me and the situation I was in. 

However these are all things I understand that it's difficult to see as difficult when you're not experiencing them. You always have to be meticulous about what you eat, how much you eat of certain foods and how much liquid you get. You need to plan every single meal and how much nutrition you get from it. You can't wing it, and you can't skip meals because you don't have the time etc. anymore. There is a whole lot of planning going into this, like there normally is with weight loss. I haven't lost more than I would in three months with a normal diet change yet, and while I haven't been as hungry as I'd likely have been and I'm sure that's easier, I've had a lot of struggles that I wouldn't have had without surgery as well. 

Other people struggle with surgery in different ways than I do. For some it is easy, for some it's hard. For me it's a happy medium, and I'm comfortable there. How difficult it is a year from now I can't really say much about, since I'm just a little over two months in."

It didn't include statistics for people who lose more than 20% of their excess weight though, so I have no idea which category you would fall into. 

Even a few pounds lost is a majorly good thing for health, so if you lose 50% and gain back 20% or if you lose 100% and gain back nothing, or if you just lose 5% that's still a major improvement. I don't think the statistic was intended to demotivate or take away from anyones progress, bot rather to make sure people set realistic goals for themselves and realize that weight loss is a difficult process with ups and downs. 

Most people gain and lose weight throughout their lives, so the most important things is to make healthy choices!"

I just wasn't one of them, and eventually there were few other ways for me out of this but surgery. It's not ever something you should choose only because you want to lose weight, there should always be a full picture involves in this decision. I've been trying different life style changes and diets for years and years like most of you. I've lost and gained, and lost, and gained. I've been at 330 and 120, back to 330, down to 150, back up to 300, down to 220, etc. 

Eventually I personally had to make a choice on whether I wanted a family or not, since it will be difficult for me (due to reasons not related to body weight). I can not safely be pregnant while overweight, and could not realistically lose and keep off the weight in time to be sure that I can still have children. When I decided that I want children, I also decided that I never want them to inherit my bad habits. That's what tipped the scale for me (no pun intended), but for other people there are other reasons. :-) In general there's always the few who thinks it's an easy out, but they generally get a very uncomfortable surprise. There's nothing easy with what you're risking with surgery, and there's nothing easy coming after either. Some things go by themselves in the start, but it's not effective without hard work. 

Surgery isn't, nor should it be a solution for anyone. It's a medical tool that has its share of effects and complications, and I think it's important to be both critical and careful when considering it."

No matter how you lose the weight you always have to stay lower than the general population. Generally with weight loss there's a huge spike in the production of hunger hormones that lasts for up to two years after your weight stabilizes, while weight loss surgery decreases the hunger hormones. Personally I find the eating part to be less challenging now than before surgery, but there's a whole new set of challenges now. They can be extremely difficult if you're not prepared for them."

I chose to have surgery because I can lose weight, but I could never keep it off long term. It was never about reverting back to old habits, but rather that you have to stay so very low on calories forever after a big loss that it's became almost impossible to regulate. I'm still young and childless, and I never want my future children to inherit the bad habits I did. Eventually my thyroid checked out of the game, my body was no longer cooperating and at 330 lbs I decided that enough was enough. I concentrated on maintaining my weight while I made my decision, did a lot of work with my head and started losing pre-op. Hopefully a combination of all of this will help me keep it off, meet my goals and give me a chance to better my own habits and the habits of my future family."
loseit,fo70klx,t1_fo6uwzt,1587570120.0,"For some it makes weight loss faster, but the entire purpose of it is that it isn't as difficult keeping the weight off after a surgery. It kind of resets your body a little. Personally, and for a lot of other people who opted to have surgery after years of losing, the problem was never our ability to lose weight. The problem was always keeping it off. I wouldn't say it's more or less difficult, but it's difficult in different ways. I have no problems with eating too much or too often or the wrong things after surgery. I do however have many other problems, like how to get enough protein on a small stomach, staying active while eating much less than normal, or forcing myself to listening to my body and not just ignore signals. Luckily I had extensive therapy before I made my choice and I'm not struggling as much with wanting food as before. 

I went to a medical lecture about obesity, and as little as 4% of ""big losers"" manage to lose and keep off 20% of their excess weight in two years, which means that a whopping 96% gain back some of it. That's numbers from my country of course, but it does seem to match up pretty accurately with experiences all over the world. We need to start treating obesity like a medical problem and not a personal failure. For everyone the solution is CICO and life style change, but the road to the destination is different for everyone. Some need the surgery, some don't need it, some do plain CICO, some do keto, etc."

BPD,fo2cxwr,t3_g53rq1,1587457660.0,"I'm sorry that you're feeling this way, and I see that a lot of you in the comment section are feeling this way as well. If you don't want tips, but just acknowledgement of your feelings, here's a little of the latter first: You are completely allowed to feel that way. It's fine to want to be cured or give up some times. Living with BPD is difficult and you're a hero for making it this far. What isn't allowed however is to actually give up, if you can try and not to. You are all so important to this community. We need your posts, comments, up votes etc. to feel validated and seen, every single one of you. 

Now, here's my tips, so if you don't want any or tips will make you feel worse right now, you can stop reading here! 

I was diagnosed when I was 19, which is around seven years ago. When I was 22 I was given the opportunity to participate in a Dialectical Behavior Therapy-program, and it helped me A LOT. I'm not in the US, and I know that not everyone in the US has those kind of treatments available to them for financial or geographical reasons, so I thought I'd share what helped me the most so you can try it/look it up: 

1. Mindfulness for anxiety and spinning. It sounds very hippie and out there and I struggled a lot with it at first. Trying mindfulness triggered my anxiety before it got better. Now I use it almost every day to try and land when I go off, and it's really helping. If it doesn't trigger your anxiety, or if you think you'd be able to push past your anxiety, I recommend you try it. There's a ton of videos and guides on the internet, so just try googling or searching up on YouTube: ""mindfulness (the mood you have)"". 

2. High intensity or sudden change in body temperature calms overwhelming feelings. When I feel something so strongly that it becomes uncomfortable, I try either doing 10-20 jumping jacks, or taking a cold shower. It sounds clichè, but that kind of distraction for your body really also settles your mind and calms you down and gives you some space from the intense emotion you were feeling. This shouldn't be used to distract yourself unless absolutely necessary. I've used it when feeling suicidal, paranoid or when I have too much anxiety to be able to succeed at mindfulness. 

3. Accept your feelings. They are valid, you are NEVER overreacting. You may me ""mis""reacting, but never overreacting. Your brain makes shortcuts, and thus may conclude that what you're feeling is in a certain situation. The reality may be that you've had this emotion triggered by said situation, but it stems from somewhere else. That does not mean that the anger, fear or sadness you feel is not valid. Accept the feeling, validate it. You are allowed to feel it. No feelings are ever wrong, they may just be misdirected. When the intensity of the feeling has passed, ask yourself where you think the feeling was coming from and what triggered it. If you can't answer that, that's okay. You don't have to agree with your feelings but you should always work on accepting them. 

4. Don't buy into the stigma of people with BPD being bad partners. I'm married with my beautiful partner of six years, and we have the healthiest relationship I know of. It's been a lot of work on both of our ends, but it works. My BPD is part of me, but it is not the essence of me. I am a sum of all of me, not just my disorder. It's only six years ago that I was in a mental hospital, planning to kill myself. Now I have a masters degree, I'm married, I have two beautiful kitties and I'm planning for children. If someone asked me back then where I thought I'd be today, I would never have answered this. 

All of this is of course easier with a coach, a therapist or a group. But I have faith that we're able to somewhat manage our disorder alone as well when everything around us fails us. We are some of the strongest people on this earth considering the emotional turmoil we go through every day or week or month. 

We got this, you guys! 💪 Best of luck to you all, I love you!"

Once I got there I calmed down a little bit, until it was my turn to be wheeled down for surgery. Freaked out again, but they helped me calm down and when I woke up I honestly don't understand why I was freaking out in the first place. It was absolutely just like falling asleep. They were really nice to me, I told them I was scared and they calmed me down and explained everything as well as they could. Then I heard the doctor saying ""Alright, it's time to go to sleep"", and next I know I woke up feeling fine and dandy and ready to walk. I slept a lot all day, but it was all very peaceful and nice. 

I'm not afraid of anesthesia anymore. I read threads and threads and threads about it, and that didn't help me at all, so knowing that my experience was fine probably won't help you much, but you will be just fine.  It's a new experience and there's no knowing how it is until you're on the other side of it, but trust the doctors. They know what they're doing, and since you're doing elective surgery they're able to do absolutely everything they can beforehand to make sure you're 100% safe and ready for both anesthesia, surgery and recovery. :)

We've generally been thinking for so long about it even before we made a decision, and then waiting and preparing and built up all these expectations and looking ahead and imagining our life in a year. It's always hard when things that you prepare for like that get pushed to a later date. Hell, if I've been looking forwards to something I can easily be very sad a out any small appointment falling through, but surgery is no small thing and calls for so much more disappointment. 

I was lucky and had my surgery about six weeks ago, but what I can share is that I was terrified after my surgery because of the corona virus. I wouldn't wish that sort of social isolation on anyone right after, because I really needed the support from my friends and family - and I'm glad I had the chance to recover before it hit my country fully. 

I would try (even though it's REALLY hard, I totally get if trying does not succeed) to try and view this as a period where you get to lose weight to get an even better starting point. For most of us, the issue isn't losing the weight, it's keeping it off. If you were supposed to have your surgery soon, they'll open for it when they can, and you can keep on losing weight now and get even better results after the surgery! It's also a really great opportunity to work even better with eating habits and your relationship with food. Work on eating slowly, drinking slowly etc. It's completely fine to not do this as well, but I would urge everyone to if they can find the motivation for it!"

loseit,fldejfu,t3_fo16uq,1585062913.0,"You're very young, but you have agency over your own body. I know this may seem condescending, but it comes from a place of worry, so please try and read it with an open mind: 

Your body is constantly changing. If you're eating mostly greasy food, that's what you need to focus on changing. Lowering the number on a scale is not what is important, and not weighing ourselves is not what made most of us obese. Don't weigh yourself. In puberty weight is fluctuating and even though you're on your way to becoming an adult, you're still a child. Being a child does not mean that you're immature or that people should not listen to you, it means that your body and your mind works differently from adult bodies and minds. 

You should be very clear that you want to lose weight for the right reasons. Is it because of your health, or are you kind of panicking? Have you been bullied? Have you struggled with depression or feeling out of place in your class, school, friend group or at home? I find it weird that your mom worries about eating disorders out of nowhere, it may be that she has picked up on some self image issues that you're not communicating. 

I was made to diet from when I was 14, and it completely destroyed me. The number on the scale decided my self worth, and it's easy to say that it won't, but most young people working to lose numbers on a scale ends up stopping or gaining weight at some point or another, because bodies work like that. For some, that's a hard blow because we don't understand what's happening. So we try and eat less, and it works etc. I gained a LOT of weight every time I felt like I failed, and a really unhealthy relationship with food that still affects me. At 18 I developed a serious eating disorder and it almost killed me, and recovering from it made me gain even more weight. 

I would recommend you to try and change your familys habits, not diet or try to make the number on the scale drop, if this is something you want to do. Go for walks every day, try and work out and find something you think is fun. For me it was boxing, which was surprising for me as a young girl, but it made me feel powerful. Don't eat less, eat the right food. The only way to succeed with this the way I see it, is to eat the most nutrious food you can find, and eat until you're satisfied (not super full, not hungry). Maybe tell your mom you don't want to focus on eating less, but that you do want to change your eating habits to have a fuller and more nutritious diet? 

Good luck. Please don't make the same mistakes I did. Nothing good comes from it. Either you gain weight, or you eventually die - or both. 

TL;DR: Make sure this is coming from the right place, be open about it, don't lie either directly or by omission, don't let the scale decide your worth, and do it because you love your body and not because you dislike it.  Eat nutrition, don't eat less. If you can't check off all those boxes, try and maintain if you want (I.e. Don't lose weight, don't gain weight). Regulate what you can, go for walks, be more active, work out and find the physical activity that's fun for you!"

I've had some discomfort, which has been predominantly my own fault. Most people don't regret the surgery at all, even with some discomfort. A lady I know had a leak and spent months in the hospital and had surgery every week to fix it. A year out, she doesn't regret it one bit. I think a lot of people who do regret it, either were really unlucky or they didn't know what to expect. 

For me, I made up my mind when I realized that obesity would very likely chip away maaany years of my life. I'd eventually get sick, real sick. Heart problems, sleep apnea, diabetes and more joint pain was knocking profusely at the door. Surgery has a 1% risk of complications (at my hospital at least). That's a lot less than 90% certainty. Some people lose that perspective, some people actually do get really sick, some people just are really grieving food and can't get out of it, some people expected it to be easy, and some people didn't read up, or aren't following the advice.

gastricsleeve,fjjks5h,t3_fdn5sf,1583400928.0,"I'd say that for most people, it's pretty alright. I've heard of very few people regretting the surgery, and those few who do were either extremely unlucky and ended up with several complications (which is a very slim chance, but it happens at random so it's impossible to foresee), or they really expected it to be an easy out. Most people I've met who have had complications also say they don't regret it. I've also met people who say they regret it because they don't handle pasta as well as before. It's all about the mindset going in. Read up, know what to expect, ask questions, talk to people, talk to your surgeons. 

I can admit that I've had some discomfort. I'm a little bit over three weeks out. I've struggled eating, can't seem to get on a good schedule. I don't want food at all, it tastes the same but it doesn't feel the same and that's the worst for me. Since I don't eat enough I have low energy and nausea, but I also know it will pass and that I can make changes to make it easier for myself. I don't regret it one bit. I'm down almost 20 lbs in a month, and down over 40 lbs in two months (counting the pre-op diet). My body doesn't hurt as much anymore. Walking is way easier. When I do manage to eat enough, I feel like the 25 year old I should be feeling like. 

As for surgery being permanent, yep. I had the same anxieties you describe. There's no way back. It's terrifying, especially before you do it. But it's also very calming, once it's done. It gives you no choice but to listen to, and get to know your body again - and that's well worth it for me. I ate myself obese after a very traumatic incident, that caused me to completely disconnect from my body. It's done wonders for my mental health and awareness, not just in weight loss terms. I can feel my body again, and it feels like it's mine. I'd never ever go back, and it's very likely only uphill from here."

gastricsleeve,fj3992t,t3_fbalje,1582973887.0,"I don't live in the US so I can't answer any practical questions for you about that, but I can answer as far as the pain concerns. I didn't think it was too bad, but I've also been amongst the lucky majority. It's important to be somewhat mentally prepared of the fact that this is major surgery, and there is a risk of complications and pain, even if it's a low risk. It's completely random and could happen to anyone. I figured that the risk of disease caused by obesity was higher for me, and thus I was willing to take that risk. 

As for the pain to expect, there is mostly gas pain and some soreness. It was completely manageable, and passed within the first week or so. Moving around helped. I'd say it was between 3-6 on a scale of 10, 6 being immediately after the surgery and before the pain killers for me (I barely remember, but I also felt nauseous which may have contributed) while 3 being the normal pain level. 

Apart from that, there's also something else you should be prepared for: It's common to be uncomfortable the first few weeks after surgery. For me it's been raging from YAY THE FOOD TASTES SOMETHING STILL, to realizing that eating is just not the same, to being dehydrated, to getting a few seconds discomfort with every ""bite"" on pureed foods, etc. It's not easy, but I think it has definitely been worth it. There is a lot of mental work to do, and I suspect the fact that I laid down the work beforehand has helped me cope a lot. There was never any doubt for me that this was what I wanted, and it's helping me cope through all the disappointments and annoyances the first few weeks, and I suspect it's gonna keep being hard for a while, but then only uphill from there!

I wasn't in an extremely bad place, but I want to make sure that once I have major surgery I don't fail because I didn't do the necessary work beforehand. 

You don't have to go to therapy if you don't feel like you need it, but rarely does anyone become obese solely because they love food and they're lazy. Often there is some disordered eating, self loathing, a food addiction or an underlying trauma to explore. You can do that exploration on your own, talking to your friends, family or partner, it doesn't have to be with a therapist. 

In regards to your question, it really depends on your location and your funds. If you're in the US, you either need the funds or an insurance plan that covers gastric sleeve.

I would stay clear for another month or two, and try meats again and see if you can stomach it then. I know that beef and lamb is not recommended within the first six months (in my program at least). Does your stomach tolerate fish? 

There are also many great meat replacements, and even though they're not exactly like meat, you can still cook somewhat ""normal"" dinners and still be able to stomach them for the time being, if you like the taste and you're able to get them down. Remember that your stomach is still getting used to a new normal, so it's normal for people to not tolerate things right now that they will be able to tolerate later. You don't have to be meat free forever, just until it doesn't make you sick! 

If your program allows nuts, that's great. Especially now that you're still struggling to stomach  things. My program advices to not eat nuts, since it's high fat and high calorie, and takes up so little space in the stomach that it's easy to get fooled and start gaining weight, so just be mindful of that (even though I'm sure you are already :-))

Stay strong, I'm sure the pain will die down faster than you think ❤️"
gastricsleeve,fher4w1,t1_fheeavu,1581528206.0,"The water isn’t much better, but I found both cool-Aid and broth to go down a bit easier. I've had one drink of protein juice, and a few teaspoons of broth. And a few small sips of water. 

How are you feeling? Are you managing the pain?"
gastricsleeve,fhe07nq,t3_f2lmq4,1581509520.0,"Wow, we're twins. (I'm 25 though). Started out at 340 lbs was 310lbs before surgery yesterday (February 11th). Was put under around 10:30, etc haha. And yes, water is a bit of a pain. It was easier with lemonade."
gastricsleeve,fhcy48t,t3_f1t8up,1581473300.0,"I think we all are to an extent. I have the same issues as you normally, but since I'm in the hospital right now it's not as bad as it's probably will be when I get home. 

But we're never going to be taken more seriously by health care professionals than we are right now, in reporting abnormal pain. I talked to my nurses and asked them when I should suspect it's something abnormal/serious and contact them, and they told me I could just contact them whenever. That being said, they also said it's so painful that you won't wonder if anything is weird, you'll know. Of course us with our anxiety knows something is wrong a lot of times when it isn't. 

Listen to your body. Get to know it. Try and get used to being uncomfortable, as cheesy as that sounds. If you take time to get to know what your pain-normal feels like (by actually just sitting down and feel it), you'll be more equipped to notice changes for the worse and even recovery. 

I freaked out last night because my upper surgery wound felt like someone was poking it with needles. Then I closed my eyes and did a body scan, and I swear I could feel those needles were tissue reconnecting and my wounds slowly healing. The surgeon agreed."

I just woke up now and it's apparent the pain meds aren't working as well anymore, so they had to adjust my dose a bit. The sad part is that my new Lil' jelly belly is not very happy with me and is not appreciative of water. It wasn't a problem until right now, so it feels like I haven't seen the worst just yet. 

Also the heart monitor keeps acting up and making me nervous haha"

norge,fg3982g,t1_fg31hjm,1580475019.0,"Jeg tenker at såpass detaljert informasjon får de finne selv. Poenget er at man bør gi informasjon om at det finnes en debatt, informasjon om positive og negative virkninger og for/mot-sidene i debatten. Opplyste valg er viktig, og vi skal ikke være  så dum at vi tror at ungdommen ikke gjør. Å snakke om prøver som kanskje kan tenke seg at kan bli aktuelle muligens i fremtiden en gang om det lar seg gjøre, i en kontekst der man skal opplyse, synes jeg blir uryddig. Konkret, sann og sikker informasjon."
norge,fg305od,t3_ewl4zb,1580464032.0,"Problemet er at verken ungdom eller voksne får nyansert informasjon. Enten er cannabis grusomt, sivilisasjonens undergang og noe du blir superavhengig av, og hvis du har røykt kan du egentlig bare legge deg ned for å dø, for du kommer uansett aldri til å bli en ekte konstruktiv samfunnsborger. Eller så er cannabis helt fantastisk, kurerer alle tingene du sliter med, et mirakelmiddel mot psykisk og fysisk sykdom og kan dessuten uten tvil kurere all kreften du har i kroppen med en gang, bare du ser en joint. 

I stedet for å la ungdom lære nummer 1, og finne nummer 2 på nett, så kan vi lære dem noe så helt enkelt som: 

""Cannabis er per i dag et ulovlig rusmiddel. Det er ikke nødvendigvis farlig for kroppen, men for noen kan det være farlig for hodet. Noen bruker lovlig cannabis som medisin, både i Norge og i andre land, fordi det kan være effektivt mot noen helsetilstander. Dette er i samråd med lege. 

Det er mange debatter om hvorvidt cannabis burde legaliseres både som medisin og som rusmiddel. Argumentene for er ofte at cannabis inneholder stoffer som isolert kan ha positiv helseeffekt for enkelte, og at staten ikke burde regulere hvilke rusmidler folk burde ha lov til å benytte seg av.  Argumentene mot er at cannabis kan utløse underliggende psykoser, og at det er vanskelig å vite hvem det vil ramme, og at staten har et ansvar overfor befolkningen både når det kommer til opplysning og oppfølging av mennesker som ruser seg på både lovlige og ulovlige rusmidler. Derfor mener noen at det å åpne for lovlig bruk av flere rusmidler vil føre til mer rusmisbruk enn vi ser i dag. Som sagt er cannabis ulovlig i dag, og om barn og unge velger å røyke cannabis så vil både politi og barnevern kobles inn. Om cannabis i fremtiden blir legalisert, vil det ha en aldersgrense, da det er påvist at denne typen rusmidler er skadelig for ungdoms utvikling.""  

Så kan man slenge på en liten: 

""Det er lurt å være kritisk til kilder man finner på internett, og gjerne sjekke hvem som har sagt det, og tenke litt rundt hvorfor de sier det. Tjener de penger på å si dette? Er det sant? Forteller de hele sannheten, eller har de valgt seg deler av en sannhet som passer inn med det de prøver å fortelle? Det er lurt å være forsiktig, og ikke gå i fella med å tro på noe bare fordi du *vil* at det skal være sant. Sjekk om andre kilder sier det samme, og diskuter det med folk rundt deg. Det finnes både gode og dårlige meninger. Gode meninger er meninger man har fordi man mener det, og man forstår hvorfor man mener det. Dårlige meninger er ofte meninger man har fordi man har hørt noen andre si det, eller meninger man har om ting man ikke egentlig gidder å lære seg noe om."" 

Nyansering er konge i rusdebatten."
badwomensanatomy,fg2zkj9,t3_ewjx3l,1580463180.0,"The only thing she slightly touched correctly upon (but still absolutely wrong) is that extremely painful cramps is *common,* but not *normal.* I get that that's not at all what she's trying to communicate, but let's at least hope that these girls will go to *proper* doctors if they experience painful periods.   


Please report this to the school board, as many others have pointed out this is harmful in so many ways."
loseit,ffp78tv,t3_dvhrxi,1580087985.0,"I'm a little late to the party here, but I just wanted to point something out: 

There are physical risks of course, but most people are aware of them going in as the surgeons at least in theory are obliged to tell you about them and make sure you understand and consent. There is a much darker side to all of this though, that isn't talked about nearly enough.

Very few people become obese to the point of needing surgery to lose, without there existing an underlying cause. Not necessarily an eating disorder, but even without one, using food for comfort is pretty normal. Food, and especially sugary food, is addictive and we rarely talk about it. I know many people in here have suffered from some sort of food addiction, and I'm currently breaking mine. I am however having weight loss surgery in just a few weeks, but it's not a choice made easily and it's not for lack of knowledge or trying. For me I've decided that it's the right choice - but I digress. 

In making an addiction impossible to uphold, it's easy to switch it with another. This is why substance abuse is so common in people who have had weight loss surgery (it's by no means close to a majority, but it's more common after weight loss surgery than other surgeries). They replace their addiction with another thing that can give them comfort, and often a very similar comfort honestly. But not everyone lose their food addiction, it's just two sides of the same coin: They get addicted to not eating. It's very well possible that your mom honestly is not feeling well, and that's the reason she's being fidgety, but be aware that it could become the start of a developing restrictive eating disorder. It's hard to look for signs in someone who is losing weight extremely fast, and is eating ridiculously small portions compared to the rest of society, but the way she talks about obese people sounds like projecting, and she clearly takes pride in how little she eats (based on what you're writing). That's common telltale signs. 

You probably have nothing to worry about, and your mother has probably just ""seen Jesus"" in her surgery and is absolutely addicted to the way weight loss is making her feel, but you know. Keep a watch out for her, if you feel that's a responsibility you want to have. Or talk to someone adult in your family, maybe your grandmother/father or your aunts or uncles or something?"
AskReddit,fcxi3yw,t3_ejdlbw,1578063492.0,"My friend started dating my roommate, and had a full on screaming session at me and my boyfriend for not hanging up the washing cloth after cleaning the kitchen. It had been about a minute, and we weren't done. He was screaming at us for nearly fifteen minutes, pretty much saying we were going to kill her.   


Turns out that she had of course been ranting to him every time something wasn't done, or we had an argument, and since we were the roommates that knew each other beforehand we were to blame whenever something wasn't cleaned or whenever something was messy. After we moved out, they quickly realized that it wasn't us, but our other roommate, who didn't even know *how* to vacuum or clean floors. I have barely spoken to them since, but I have more contact with the previously shitty roommate than with the ex-friend who felt entitled to scream at me in my own home, where he was a guest, for something completely trivial."

If he doesn't want more kids, he should take responsibility for that regardless of who his partner is, and not let the burden be someone else responsibility. It's everyone's own responsibility to make sure an unwanted pregnancy doesn't happen. You're taking your part of the responsibility, and he's just enjoying the benefit of your responsibility. Him making a point of that is really unfair, and honestly kind of mocking you for your years of making his life easier."

The death of Natives upon colonization was absolutely not a subject up for discussion for the first seminars with educated historians. 

I'm guessing there has been plenty of other theories on this though, that I guess you can view as history-based, but my guess is that most either believed in religious causes for the diseases, believed it has something to do with their ""savage way of life"" or just straight up didn't give a shit.
