I hate it because it can hurt. It has too much power sometimes. She gets more attention than me sometimes,  I hate how some people think it’s just a toy.

BDSMAdvice,fpdonfx,t3_gcrt8h,1588531138.0,"Honestly never figured it out. It usually was whoever was in the subbiest mood got to sub/be little. My ex and I were both switches and littles so sometimes it got complicated.  We’d watcha Disney film for one of us and both end up little and trying to hide it. Personally I would just suppress it until it was. My turn. So whenever the other person got out of that space I’d ask may I have my turn. 
I’ve heard of some people having schedules. My ex had mental health issues so at night he would always get to fall asleep little so he felt safer. And I would always get to be little in the mornings as I needed that mood boost in the mornings and help to get ready (I’m disabled) and when he would get me dressed I’d always end up little so yeah.  But the rest of the days were whatever.   
With sex, it  was usually clear who felt more dominant but if we were unsure we’d just ask each other and go with whatever.  He was usually more dominant in sex and me more submissive so it worked out. But I also enjoy being dom so I would have that time too when he felt submissive."

But if I had to choose I would say after my parents divorce I wish my dad never turned us against my mother because it really ducked things up for everyone. Nothing good came out of the way he treated us at that time and it’s caused patterns with other Conflicts in my life which I’m just not okay with and will be really hard to break. In the grand scheme it’s small compared to other things I’ve been through. But those other things made me stronger.  This just broke me and triggered my eating disorder and fear of standing up for myself in arguments.  So it’s just something I could’ve reallllllly done without.

Experts in pedophilia would say fantasy is very different to acting upon it.  There’s difference between a minor attracted person and a child abuser.  It’s obviously quite messed up STILL. But it’s not the first time people have made art which sexualises minors.  In that case also adverts where children are in minimal clothing like bathing suites could be sexualised.  Anything can be sexualised. It doesn’t make it okay. But it’s similar to gore art. It doesn’t mean the person has done that or wants to."

It is important to remember that some people with those parts cantbprgasm internally anyway and clitoral things feel better. Maybe he would rather using a toy or something.

I’m sorry he treated you that way. Your boyfriend sounds like a great guy and I’m sure since you’re in counselling he’s aware you do have some issues in general,  it may actually help him understand what you need better by telling him.   If it’s to hard to say it verbally the way you’d like to I recommend writing a letter. It sounds cheesy but it’s actually helpful because you can org it exactly as you want. It also indicates it’s hard to speak about verbally.  I really hope you’re able to heal and get some peace in your mind.  I’ve been in similar situations and know how it can feel.  You don’t have to get over it.  You’re aloud to feel however you feel right now.  You deserve to be given the love and care he wasn’t providing."
