He knocked it out of the park though. Fun fact: he recut The Hobbit trilogy as a two hour movie to unwind after playing David Duke.
Anxiety,fazpybw,t1_fazojtc,1576418487.0,"Glad to hear that! And yes, when you're alone, watching a movie or reading a book, your mind tends to wander. I'd say it's a good sign that you don't notice it when you're in social situations or other things your mind's completely focused on. The reason I'm telling you to see a doctor if you're worried, is only because it's not the best idea to consult the internet for these types of things. There are experts for a reason, and a trip to the doctor is a small step to take :)"
Anxiety,fazp6aw,t3_eaz0gm,1576418288.0,"I feel you - though for me it's not only when I'm going to sleep, I get these feeling of anxiety throughout the whole day and hypochondria plays a big part in this. First of all, stay off the internet - don't self-diagnose using Dr. Google. If you're really worried - go see your doctor. It might not be necessary, but when in doubt it can never hurt. I can tell myself a million times it's okay, my friends and family can tell me I'm fine and even the internet can make it seem like all is well - but those feelings of doubt can linger, even after you've heard and read so many affirmations. Have you thought about therapy? Perhaps that's also something you should discuss with your doctor."
Anxiety,faznfmh,t3_eaymfj,1576417894.0,"Anxiety makes the body feel different - not in good ways. Do you still notice these things when you're not focused on them? If your mind's distracted while you're watching a movie or reading a book for example, do you still notice these feelings? For me, personally, if I focus too much on one pain or feeling of uneasiness in my body, it gets a lot worse than it really is. I have anxiety, causing hypochondria among things, so I overthink every little abnormality in my body. If you're really worried, I suggest seeing a doctor and I really urge you to stay off the internet - that's one of the worst places (if not the worst place) to look up the possible meaning of your symptoms. Even Redditors who claim to have the proper experience or knowledge, won't give you the expertise your doctor can give you."
Anxiety,fazlvht,t1_fawnr17,1576417458.0,"Want to chime in by saying he's right - don't listen to that kind of negativity. Been dealing with anxiety my entire life, and I graduated high school and college! If I can do it, so can you. Wasn't always easy, but after a while my brain was so focused on studying, that it didn't even have time to overthink and make me feel anxious. Sure, it might take some more time, effort and/or professional help, but the worst that can happen is that you come out stronger in the end :) Good luck with everything! I'm sure you can do this."
Anxiety,fazkvqs,t1_fab0opi,1576417205.0,"It's been a few days since you started this thread, but just want to chime in by saying I recently saw my doctor for a referral to get therapy (was relieved after I took this step), and he told me to absolutely stay off Dr. Google (yes, he used that word). Did it solve my hypochondria, which I've been dealing with for as long as I can remember, hearing this from a professional? Not entirely, but having a doctor tell you to stay off the internet and come to him if you have complaints/worries, feels better. So if you're really worried, go see a doctor. Even WebMD has a special page dedicated to the dangers of self-diagnosis through the internet."
Anxiety,f87zc64,t1_f8544v1,1574345651.0,"I always feel like I shouldn't feel calm/happy, because I'm always worried that there's something bad lurking further down the road. Being calm and collected seems almost irresponsible because it feels like I'm dropping my guard. It's like I have to be on constant alert to keep a watchful eye out for anything that might make my life extremely difficult."
