Lots of people with your GPA get accepted at PA school. People here make posts wondering about their stats and others comment saying that their stats are mediocre and they need XYZ to make it better, and these people through some kind of improvement get in. There are so many ""low GPA success stories"" on here and on the physicianassistantforum. 

Your cGPA might ""low"" but it's not the worst, you have a decent justification, and you can make yourself a competitive applicant through other means (LOR, GRE, PCE, PS, volunteering, etc.)

I'm on the same boat : ) I have a 3.3 and a 3.2 c/s GPA, I'm going to apply next year and I'm studying for the GRE and hoping to get a high score so that it can somewhat speak for my ability to study and take tests (despite the GRE being an ""easy"" test compared to other things). I'm getting PCE as a phlebotomist with some other PCE duties and hoping to have close to 3000 by next cycle. I'm going to try to write a PS that's personal and hopefully speaks about my interest in the profession. I'm going to volunteer for 6 months and shadow a PA for 6 months too. I'm practically starting out, and I also feel worried about getting in, but I'm going to try. I think you can too!

If you don't end up taking things like genetics and biochem make sure you don't apply to programs that have those as prereqs and apply to programs that accept scribing as PCE. Look at programs median accepted GPAs and PCE to get a feeling for the type of applicant that gets accepted there. That's what people mean by applying selectively. 

You can do it : ) thousands of others have too."

Estimated hours at time of application: 2800 as a medical screener and phlebotomist

Volunteering / Shadowing: I haven't started either but hopefully after 6 months the virus situation will have calmed down and I can take part at a program in a hospital nearby where they offer observation of a provider for volunteering hours / a 6 month commitment.
