AskMen,fpckj5l,t3_gcdu8j,1588503981.0,"Not being appreciated for the things you do as a man that are just hidden responsibilities on your shoulder. 
Tragedy in the family? The man of the house has to be strong and unwavering, and figure out the plan of action while everyone else gets to mourn.  
We don't get to show our emotions or we're considered weak, pathetic, blah blah blah
We're also expected to somehow magically always have our lives together, or it gets seen as something wrong. No one bats an eye at a woman with no job but a man with no job? Must be a screw up. 
The men in my life live their lives serving others, but I rarely, if ever see them being appreciated for anything they do. They also don't get compliments very much. I'm sure this is almost universal, and I can prove it.

Go appreciate a man in your life for something that he did / does. Go tell him he looks good today. Tell him he's a good father. Tell him he's a genuinely good person. Tell him he's worked hard to get where he is in life, and he deserves a break. 

Tell him you're there for him. 

Chances are, he won't know how to react. Because men are not used to people acknowledging the things that they do, they're not used to being taken for granted, as a constant safety net for the people around them.

And chances are, you'll make his day."

AskMen,fegs4qm,t3_eovuy0,1579101262.0,"Compliments. Men are starved of them. Guys will spend day and night thinking about a simple compliment they received. 

Show us you care about us and our safety. As a dude I always find myself waiting until women get into cabs safely at night, waiting for them to call to make sure they made it home safe, walking them home at night, etc. But as a dude I have to travel back alone, or walk the opposite direction at night, with my hand in my pocket and my keys between my knuckles. I always feel a bit of happiness when I get home to a call/text asking if I made it back safe. 

Check in on us. I found out that women do this amongst themselves quite a bit but men definitely not as much. We tend to feel like we have to deal with whatever we're going through on our own. Even if the check in gets a dry response akin to ""I'm fine."", it always feels good to know that someone is thinking about you and cares about you.

Take some time and think about the ""little things"" that men in your life do that you might not have noticed. The next time you notice it, appreciate it verbally. 

Basically any type of appreciation/compliment that is genuine and from the heart will go a long way in terms of making a guy feel good or special. Don't overdo it though, it might lose it's meaning."
