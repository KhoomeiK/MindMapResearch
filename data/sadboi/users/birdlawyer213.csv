TooAfraidToAsk,fk1ozr2,t1_fk1n0wl,1583784055.0,"Thank you so much for the kind words. Your support really means a lot. I am currently in therapy (since August) and it's been really helpful. I know my therapist specializes in CBT, but I'm not sure really what that entails so I will ask her when I next see her. I also take an SSRI that seems to help a lot, but it's the same one my mom takes, which is part of the reason I asked this.

In addition, my boyfriend (22m) of about a year and a half recently expressed that he's concerned about our future. Because of my mom's anxiety and that she takes the same SSRI, he fears that my anxiety will be like this forever (or get worse). I have already seen improvements since August, but I have struggled a lot since January when I was in a car accident that totaled my car and gave me a concussion. 

I have confidence in myself and am working really hard to get better, but I don't know how to give him confidence in me for the future because I don't know what's going to happen. I can't guarantee that something won't happen that will trigger my anxiety or make it worse for a period of time. He doesn't get anxiety whatsoever and wakes up and goes to sleep happy every day. He doesn't understand, which is okay, but because of that, I don't know how to give him hope for our future."
