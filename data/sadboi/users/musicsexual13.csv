guitarpedals,fr418hv,t3_gmf9ok,1589872401.0,"Thanks for this well thought out post. I was mixed up about these as I‚Äôm a fuzz lover. The Dallas arbiter fuzz he made sounds great, but I mean doesn‚Äôt Dunlop already have a silicon fuzz face? A band of Gypsies fuzz face? Etc. I have a hoof reaper by earthquaker, and their tone bender in that is amazing. I use it for clean tones with the volume rolled back on my guitar and then for nice fuzzy playing with the volume up. Anyways thank you for reminding me JHS is somewhat of a trickster. I will not be purchasing any of these fuzzes"

Personally I‚Äôd like to think everyone is here for that purpose, but some people are just too distracted and involved in the material world to realize.. my mind goes to the saying how everyone gets a call, not all pick up. Maybe they are just non players in this lifetime though? Empty shells, victims and puppets of the system and it‚Äôs various strings of control. Perhaps if one believes in karma, they came here to pay out different karmic debts acquired from past lifetimes.. so possibly they have to deal with those debts before they have a chance or calling for self realization?
