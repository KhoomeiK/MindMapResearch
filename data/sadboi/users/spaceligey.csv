Esthetics,f21hj9x,t1_f1xscti,1569872299.0,whatâ€™s the difference between a med esthetician/spa and the other route?
dpdr,f1q1lff,t1_f1b5i0o,1569691838.0,"yeah i agree with the previous comment. it helps to really just try your hardest to not think about it. itâ€™s kind of like when you smoke weed and you get waaay too in your head with those cyclical thoughts and you canâ€™t seem to escape because you think about the fact that youâ€™re stuck in these cyclical thoughts. it helps me to know everything changes and everything evolves...itâ€™s just the natural progression of things. so although i feel like nothing is real and maybe have felt that for years, change is inevitable (both good change and bad change, but for me either sentiment is calming for some reason). also changing locations when your dpdr is particularly bad has helped me in the past (preferably to an outdoor location). but tbh medication is what really helped me in the long run. i have bipolar disorder (so for one it helped to get diagnosed with that and to stop taking antidepressants which only made my anxiety way worse and feel in a fog all the time). and then i got on anti-seizure meds (also used to help bipolar disorder) and those helped greatly. if youâ€™re considering meds (or are already on them) just be as calm as you can especially during the trial and error periods. bc sometimes meds can make you feel even more foggy and not real...which is why iâ€™d been so reluctant to take them in the first place. some meds definitely made me feel unreal, but with the help from a VERY trusted psychiatrist, i was able to get set up with some good meds and it worked out for the better."
Showerthoughts,f1avq68,t3_d8d0gc,1569309717.0,i think this is my favorite post iâ€™ve ever read
dpdr,f1avewc,t3_d8i2fi,1569309248.0,"yes yes. happens to me from time to time, sometimes in phases. have you ever tried that 5 senses thing? naming 5 things you see, 4 things you hear, 3 things you taste, and so on (can be in any order) until you get to 1. this helps me feel more grounded. sometimes it doesnâ€™t even feel like iâ€™m talking. maybe thatâ€™s what youâ€™re referring to? it can be unsettling. iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re feeling this way."
camping,f1auvb7,t3_d8dgqr,1569308433.0,"what a cute pup! i havenâ€™t taken my rescue camping yet because iâ€™m scared sheâ€™d run off. typically she stays nearby me/my girlfriend, but every now and then she gets excited and majorly tugs on her leash (like she would run off if she wasnâ€™t on a leash) if she sees another dog/animal/sometimes person especially. do you tie her up when you camp with her?"
HealthAnxiety,f1aulem,t3_d8dael,1569308039.0,"damn that was an intense post. i will say for me personally itâ€™s more the details of the illness that really trigger me and iâ€™m thankful the OP didnâ€™t include that in his/her post (although itâ€™d be completely in their right to do so if they wished). it actually kind of made me feel...positive, safe? in a weird way. like that was such an accepting, inspirational post it almost made me less anxious about the uncertainties that are our health/existence in general. i can also relate to how triggering that could be for others, too. health is scary. thinking about it can be tormenting. but when i hear stories about people going through something like that it makes me feel like i can overcome my anxiety regarding health and death and lack of control. itâ€™s taken me a lot to get to this point, and i know iâ€™ll have backslides too, but in the past that post would have really upset me and sent me into an unsightly panic. iâ€™m thankful for the people whoâ€™ve supported me in life and on this sub, for the brave folks who experience illness and inspire me to be brave. that OP is so fucking strong. and iâ€™m so inspired by them, by all of you. i definitely agree, though, please donâ€™t click on that post if youâ€™re part of this sub and have health anxiety/hypochondria. the less we can trigger ourselves the better. i just wanted to offer a positive/optimistic outlook for those who have already stumbled upon the post and are feeling overwhelmed. iâ€™m here for any and all of you if you need."
StartledCats,f1atbzz,t3_d8a03n,1569306303.0,look at those wide-eyed stragglers
HealthAnxiety,ezr3pbk,t3_d1lqud,1568068083.0,"how ya doing now? this sounds EXACTLY like a panic attack to me. i get chest pain and shortness of breath when i start to get panicky (as do most of us iâ€™m sure) and it just perpetuates itself because we are predisposed to health-related fears. just like others have said before me, next time this happens distract yourself. i turn on a comedic show or movie, sing or play guitar or piano, draw, do a crossword, play solitaire, take a walk, etc etc. i find the more things iâ€™m doing, the less i focus on the way my body feels. we all probably have hypersensitivity (i for sure do), so the more you can draw attention away from your body and sensations that you may or may not feel, the better off youâ€™ll be in situations like this. remember, your mind is so powerful. just as much as we panic, we also have incredible abilities to help ourselves come out of those anxious places. itâ€™s just a matter of learning how to access those parts of our mind. weâ€™re all here for you :)"
KitchenConfidential,eza9xqf,t3_d04xq8,1567797465.0,"ahhhh thanks so much for everyoneâ€™s encouraging responses! last night wasnâ€™t nearly as bad as i was building it up in my mind to be. sure i messed up on a few things (at one point i had a ticket time for one table being close to one hour LOL whoops) but everyone was super understanding and helpful. i really like the job and i think, like most have said, with time and practice and not being afraid to make mistakes iâ€™ll get it down :) my ultimate goal is to become a line cook somewhere so if i really get this down i think itâ€™ll be fun to transition into a cook position!"
