The colour stripper was amazing, I followed the instructions, doubled the rinse time (basically ten thousand years of rinsing) and it was great, super effective! Ginger... But much lighter. Then over the next week or so it gradually oxidised. Also you have to be careful using peroxide (in the lighter) as it can oxidise and go dark again.

Basically I wouldn't waste your time with the stripper, you're nice and light anyway. I'm sure it will bleach up lovely, maybe need a toner afterwards."

Seemingly putting their desire to buy/browse luxury items before the health and well being of the staff who had no choice but to continue to work until told otherwise. For obvious reasons, make up testers were removed from the counters. The fuss people were making about not being able to play with make up would have been hilarious if it wasn't so infuriating. 

My experience shopping for essentials recently has been eye opening. The pandemic has brought out the worst in the public. On a Tuesday I witnessed a mother and teenage daughter laugh at a member of staff for asking them to observe social distance. The staff member was clearly (and understandably) distressed by their ignorance and they seemed to think this was the funniest thing that had ever happened. ""alright love, calm down we've not got Covid-19"" *mocking laughter*. I have no idea how people can be so flippant about another human having to work through a pandemic so they can feed their ignorant faces. It's sickening.
