I was thinking of running a vm and migrating the project over to a linux environment. But it's for a class that is about to end. Ehhh, not sure if it is worth the trouble. It's a weird specific issue with visual studio. Maybe if I turn off the debugging feature?

Coronavirus,fmicuvv,t1_fmib5dr,1586107049.0,"I grew up in foster care because my mom and dad were addicts. I dropped out of 8th grade and got a dui when I was 19. I got a girl pregnant at age 20 and didnt want my son to go through what I did. I decided to go and get my GED and license back with the help of TANF. I ended up going to a community college because of the 3000 from financial aid and I needed the money. I ended up liking school and stayed in for the extra money every semester and got a weekend part time security job.

I transferred to a 4 year university for computer science 4 years ago and am taking my last semester and will graduate finally.  

I still like to drink a little and dont do drugs anymore. One day I will be free from the alcohol and will hopefully look back at it as I do with all the other obstacles I had to overcome. 

Stay strong brother."
