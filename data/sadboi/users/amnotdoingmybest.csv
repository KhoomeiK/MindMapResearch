swatchitforme,foztjts,t1_fozqj0l,1588196610.0,"Thanks for the advice. I don't mind a light bit of shimmer but obvious glitter is a bit of a turn off.

I can buy Fenty online, but no where in my city stocks it in the physical shops so I can't swatch testers. 

Just curious, but do you prefer one formula over the other?"
swatchitforme,fozo55b,t1_foznx5f,1588193927.0,"Thank you!

I haven't been able to see the difference in the individual   images I've seen. It's clear here that they are different shades- I'll definitely go for Fuego flush once the lockdown is over."

BeautyGuruChatter,f0k1fg2,t3_d56jxn,1568667956.0,"The Irish boots website recently started stocking morphe online, and I thought I'd see what was available. I'm not really interested in buying, just seeing what of the (in)famous line was now readily available. They have a brow collection up with what looks the brow pomade that people have been expecting! The description online (trying to link but failing miserably-never used imuger before) calls the product in the pot a brow gel. Hmmm....

From what I remember, some import information about morphe products was shared a couple of months ago. One being a brow pomade. Shortly after, Jacklyn Hill began to talk about how she is all about using pomades for her brows now. 

Has this product been officially announced yet? Anyone else not shocked at all that Jacklyn Hill has been mentioning pomades lately?"

For me it's about 40euro a tube, but there is now a generic, which cuts the price in half so I'm very grateful for that. If you can figure out a way to afford it, do give it a go. It's worked out for me way better than any steroid ever did."
