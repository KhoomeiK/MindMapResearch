MakeupRehab,fntiy8y,t3_g3mz5g,1587242593.0,"Normally I’d just go with subtle brown eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara for school as far as my eye makeup goes but since I have to wear a mask but also still work at a bubble tea shop with many customers still I’ve just neglected the base makeup part, something that I spent a lot of time perfecting since it was my main concern since I have a lot of acne scarring and really focused more on the eyes. I feel like I’m getting much more use out of my eyeshadow palettes now and though I’m a little worried that I won’t be able to pan the base products I’ve planned to, I can only hope that I continue to use up eyeshadow after everything is over."
offmychest,fnfkew7,t3_fx62g9,1586909786.0,"Everybody pretty much hates working but I feel so frustrated because I was just a high school senior working my part time job on the weekends before this pandemic hit and my boss only schedules the same few people when we have plenty employees that can work and only a few said they wanted to stay home during this time. However, I’m working roughly 25 hours a week now and our business isn’t “essential” imo. That may not seem like a lot but I have like one day off a week now and I still have to juggle my online assignments and it’s so tiring having to work and go home and do schoolwork until I fall asleep and virtually have no free time. This sounds so ignorant because I know many other people have it much worse than me but I just wanted to vent to strangers on the internet lol."

MakeupRehab,fdzwkis,t3_enak7z,1578797533.0,I have issues with hyperpigmentation from acne and I used to research concealers whenever I had the time. I could have easily covered it with color corrector and layers of concealer but I wanted something easier and with less steps so I tried applying this concealer I considered pretty high coverage and just put what I needed on + blended it out with the real techniques setting brush and was really light handed about it and it was better than any other product I’ve ever used! I didn’t love the concealer that much bc of multiple reasons but applying it that way made it the only concealer I ever reach for now.

MakeupRehab,fcl7sqh,t3_ehn6df,1577741665.0,"As a teenager who’s generation z, I spent too much on makeup already and that’s why I’m apart of this subreddit. I’m personally trying to hold back and become generally less wasteful in all aspects of my life but mostly makeup and skincare. As for my friends who do like makeup, a lot of them have the same perspective that there needs to be a better product out there and have a few influencers who they trust and buy products because of. I think my generation definitely tries to buy from companies they support (like cruelty free or even how “problematic” the company is) but I don’t think we’re at the point where we want to cut back on consumerism in the makeup industry. But my generation is really into buying second hand and not supporting fast fashion so maybe in a decade or so there may be more attention onto the makeup industry’s excessive consumerism as well."
MakeupRehab,fchrhcz,t1_fcctock,1577653322.0,there seems to be a decent amount of people on this subreddit who also struggle with EDs its really shocking
MakeupRehab,fchfdjg,t3_eh3axw,1577649917.0,I definitely felt this way and that’s how I found this subreddit. I think it was the huge influx of makeup products that eventually seemed like the same thing. The new releases became boring but the fact that influencers kept calling each new release the best product ever bothered me because I totally fell for their reviews and continued to buy whatever they were sent in PR! Before my rehab I claimed that makeup was my hobby but like many other people on here it was really buying makeup that was the hobby.
AsianBeauty,fc76r15,t3_egcmjj,1577499036.0,I’ve only tried their zero gram matte lipstick in adorable but it’s probably my favorite lipstick ever! It’s a nice MLBB shade and it really feels like there isn’t any product on the lips. In a way it has a powder finish but it isn’t flakey or drying on the lips at all. It’s an amazing formula and I highly recommend it for anyone who likes mattes but hates the feeling of product on their lips.

PanPorn,fb0ool4,t3_eb0z3c,1576427930.0,"(Clockwise from the largest pan) 
Ulta’s finishing powder in fair to light: I’ve had this for two years now and honestly I don’t love it or hate it, I don’t have much to compare it to but it is pretty orange on me so I won’t be repurchasing it after I finish it. It’s also been repressed once and maybe that explains the weird sharp edges on the pan lol. 

E.L.F.’s Prime and Stay finishing powder in translucent: Also had this for two years and can’t say much about it. (Lol I’ve only used these two pressed powders and have like three years of makeup experience, this is probably a shit review) I stopped using it once I got into coty airspun though since I used to wear this under my eyes. 

NYX’s high definition blush in taupe: My first contour powder ever (also two years ago)! I only bought this because I read that it was a good contour shade for pale skin but I’m ashamed to say that I’ve gotten this far into the product to only now realize that it may be too dark lol. I think their HD blush is discontinued? So I wouldn’t have any chance of repurchasing anyways. (If you have any good recommendations for contour powders for asian fair skin, please comment lol)"
