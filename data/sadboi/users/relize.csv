AskReddit,f81s54g,t3_dyjbsw,1574176081.0,I'm feeling worse every day. I started a new job a month ago and was told great things about it but it's awful and it's sent me back into depression and my medication isn't working anymore. I'm not getting any responses to job applications and I'm feeling hopeless.  I can't quit my job and I just want to be happy again but I don't feel like I even know how I can do that. And one of the only people I'm friends with at this job fell this morning and broke his back. I just want to run away from this place but my wife and I can't afford to live on just her pay alone even for a month so instead I'm crying in the bathroom typing this and I'm glad to know there's at least a few people who care.

At work I'm seen as one of the hardest working, nicest, and most social people but the whole time I'm thinking about going to my car and leaving or binge eating on my lunch break and I just fake it until I leave. I feel like if I work hard, my managers will appreciate me and make me feel cared about and I do feel this when I'm there. And making other people happy or helping customers seems to help me get through workday a little better. But as soon as I have a day with nothing to do at work I just kind of stand around in one of the coolers on my phone until I have to do something and it usually will make my next week worse until I just kind of feel better. Then at home I sit around and do nothing until my wife gets home and then I have to put on my act again until the next day. And I can't talk to her because her anxiety just makes her feel like she made me feel that way or that she feels worse, so I can't be myself or talk to her about how I feel and having to act happy all but 2 hours of the day is completely exhausting.
