AskReddit,fr145em,t3_gln8tu,1589812900.0,"My best friend and I are both decently likely to have had it right before it got bad where we lived, as in the week before. It started as a bit of a sore throat and cough on the Sunday night, by Tuesday I felt like a train wreck, pounding head and couldn’t breathe properly. Tuesday was the only day I was allowed off school though, I was back in on Wednesday. I vividly remember walking down the assembly hall feeling horrendously dizzy because I couldn’t get a proper breath in. I was ill for two weeks, with a constant headache and cough, though it wasn’t anywhere close to as bad by the end of week one. 

Two weeks after I got sick my school announced we were closing because someone had called in and tested positive. The day after that all schools closed. 

I find it incredibly ironic that my year head had actually congratulated me on coming in despite being ill, because even if it wasn’t covid I would have been advised to self isolate if I’d become sick just a week later than I did. 

My best friend was in the same boat as I was, though she was off for the entirety of the first week. She lost her sense of smell and taste for a bit  I believe, which was just announced as another symptom."
