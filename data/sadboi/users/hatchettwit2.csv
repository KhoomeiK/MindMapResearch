&#x200B;

It's so ass backwards. I know a guy in tech that works from home sometimes. He could realistically be working from  home most days, but the bosses have it in their head that if they can't see him working then he's probably goofing off despite all their tickets being answered. Looking busy is more important than doing a good job. At home he can get something to eat and continue working while eating, at work it takes an hour to go somewhere and come back. He can also smoke while working at home instead of having to exit the building through 2 security stops only to be harassed every single time he goes outside by people who want to bum a smoke or change (and they get aggressive quite often, I hear it every time we're on a call during his break). They could get more productivity, pay less, and keep their people safer but it's more important that people ""look busy.""

askaconservative,fqfdioh,t1_fq0p4rv,1589322974.0,"I am indeed aware the procedure is not necessarily easy or comfortable as well as potentially life threatening yes. 
I am making analogies to create or find solid connections between morality and logical consistency. 
What I was saying by the comparison to a toxic marriage and dangerous ground point is that it's a slippery slope if you put killing someone or something because it's inconvenient. Yes, it is a possibility but I would add it can also be argued that it's not much of one. More pointing at the morality, which is subjective to begin with, consistency. For example, you asked about net positive and net negatives for society. There are many slippery slopes one could go down that would be new positives for society while still being unjust, dystopic, and even cruel.
I not think banning abortion by itself would be a net positive, and honestly quite the opposite most likely.  That's honestly why I do not favor banning it. I think that options increase likelihood of each baby surviving pregnancy and that free access to birth control such as condoms, while it does absolve the user of taking their own responsibility to provide themselves with a safety net for their actions, creates the positive effect of decreasing abortions significantly. So say if one's moral argument was that we should do anything to save those lives, then that would be an excellent option and one that needs to be endorsed by more of the pro life crowd.
Interestingly, I have mixed feeling about capital punishment. I do believe there are some people so dangerous to others that leaving them alive is a threat to those around them. However, I have a moral objection to accidentally executing innocent parties and sit against the action for that reason. Financially in America it's also just cheaper to keep them alive than spend 20 years fighting lawyers. 

For me, it comes down to this. I don't believe it's moral to end a baby because they didn't have a choice in their creation, the parents did. As far as an adult, while I do understand that genetics and how you are brought up can play critical roles in your life I still fall back on personal responsibility. While not strictly libertarian, I believe that your rights extend right till the next person's begin. You're free to do what you want, but it's a problem when it negatively infringes on the next guy (in the case of abortion, the unborn child that had no willing participation here). Along the same libertarian line, I also believe that in order to create positive societal change in for example abortion, you'd need to work on educating people and challenging them to consider how their actions affect others. You're free to sleep around as much as you want, but should you? You could do it without bc, but should you? With freedom comes responsibility, honestly it's that that I fight for. I will not vote to illegalize abortion, but rather to encourage people to be responsible in their own freedom to live their life how they choose. That can be incredibly hard I realize. In the end, I think THAT will create net positive for society, but it's not just one thing that will get us there. It has to be a guiding principle perhaps. 

edit: oh lordy. I did not realize that was huge blocks of text. my apologies!

It's just an interesting subject to me. Even my own arguments sometimes are slippery slopes at times. I think if you get down and dirty thinking about it, that's bound to happen."

I think that's the least someone should do after they themselves irresponsibly brought a child into the world. 

I feel like it's hard to defend the logic of abortion if you apply it to anything other than a baby, which is what sits wrong with me. Let's say I marry someone abusive. I'm under duress, I regret my decision to marry  this person. The consequences of staying are more than I can handle. Is it okay to kill this person so I do not have to live with my decision to stay? I'm not asking you to compare a baby to an adult with awareness of their actions, I am asking you if ending a life is a viable solution to escaping the results of your own decisions. 

For me, saying that convenience is a good reason to end a human life is dangerous ground. There have been many people that would have made my life more convenient if they'd been eliminated, from people who caused me true distress to those that were annoying or required me to give up my time and money to help. I could also argue that if they weren't alive, they wouldn't be suffering. 

It all stems from the initial decision to disregard risk for the benefit of the reward. The consequences, no matter what you choose, may hurt. But the decision I believe should benefit both the baby and the mother, not just the mother."

Dried beans are also one of my favorites, you can make a big pot for like a dollar. I paired that with stuff I found at Aldi's often, so like beans and a piece of veal would come out to just over a dollar per serving.

Our government didn't take it seriously in December, January, and perhaps not even in February. It could have acted more swiftly, it could have cut off travel early, and we could have quarantined every single person that had to come back home over a week or two. We could have temporarily suspended immigration as well. Later on, we could have even had a national quarantine put into effect. Let's be honest, the right would have raised hell about mah liberties and the left would have raised hell about racism or at best nationalism in such drastic measures. We saw both after the limited actions currently taken for context. Haven't watched a ton of news, can't vouch for amount there, but it's been noticeable in Youtube. Instead a lot of the decision about how far to go was left to the states. Trump has been doing some good work on the slowing of the virus spread and reaction to it, he's also done some bad work on the same matter. Honestly I think it came down to his inexperience in politics, his ego, and a desire not to turn his base against him by forcefully keeping them at home at this time.

That said, this particular statement about how America is leading in the number of cases is deceptive. If you don't believe me  go do the math for yourself, if you add up the total number of cases for North AND South America you won't reach Europe's totals. The spread here is bad in some areas like New York, not so bad in other states like Tennessee. It's not done spreading, it's not from what I've heard yet reached it's peak, but currently that's where it stands. We're not ""winning"" in most cases. It's like comparing the muscle mass of a chihuahua and a pit bull and calling the pit bull overweight because it has more and it's quite frankly dishonest.

I suppose I'm what you'd call  **a role player.** I do enjoy pvp, but I don't want utter chaos. Killing people is not my main goal, it's just something that happens. I enjoy farming. I enjoy connecting with people, both good and bad. I want something completely different than you. Now I'll give you that it does seem that there is a bit less skill required to shoot now than before, though I did not play back then. However this is what I noticed. You can get most of what you want right now if you play the right server. 

&#x200B;

What I mean by this is that you want experiences modifications can provide. If you want a battlefield or less time sink to get to the pvp, there are servers setup for just that. They remove or edit elements that hinder you getting there quickly so you can have fun quickly. The thing is though, you come from the mindset that has been popularized by youtubers and their fans which is ""this is a pvp game, pvp is all that matters."" This happened in Minecraft too, the audience decided  ""this is a building game,"" which made people think I was the weird one for wanting complete anarchy and pvp. While not exactly a sandbox, Rust is similar in that it can make both of us happy with completely different play styles and goals both in the main and modified game play. 

&#x200B;

You put a lot of thought into you post but you don't know it all. I don't either, I learned about Legacy from you actually and how shooting changed. Still, I have some insight.  For example about night time. Night is not without benefits or ability to play. It's great for sneaking, going to monuments that get camped a lot, transfering items between bases or stashes, scouting bases in secret, trolling (I once built a wall with a huge sign of ugandan knuckles feet away from someone and they never noticed me because of the dark), ect. You can still farm, you just need light. Light increases the risk, but that increases player interaction as well. If you're staying inside your base and not playing at night, that's your choice. You're avoiding the risk, but you're also missing out on the benefits. Less people go out at night, use that to your advantage. 

Another thing you brought up is helicopters. I'll admit you make a fine point about how it makes it much easier to transfer loot with less risk. Not zero risk however. If someone sets up traps, you can be shot down. If someone shoots your pilots, you go down. With some effort, the skies can become dangerous. I've seen a lot of people get wrecked by people placing sam turrets in the water off the shore of oil and cargo too. 

As far as tc upkeep, you can play servers with no upkeep. Upkeep prevents a base from getting too big without the manpower and dedication to keep it up, it also prevents the map from being littered with bases going unused or used to block others. There are absolutely ways to bend the tc's limits and also mods you can eliminate them entirely with. I like upkeep, it encourages you to build smarter or pay for it. 

Those insane bases you posted pics of are still around. Mods make it possible to build larger with TCs that hold higher stacks or have no upkeep. Additionally even in vanilla you can still build big and with lots of layers of walls if you choose. It just comes with a cost.

As far as farming and time needed, you make some good points. I'd add that some people like farming, sometimes even more than anything else. Giving them a place to fit into a social network is a good thing imo. Farming is also not pvp free, especially on high pop servers you run into people often. More often than not on official they're aggressive and want your stuff.  Again if you don't like farming and that time sink, there's mods. 

This game is designed to be social. You mention a lot of things that seem to want to avoid that. From what I can tell you want a battlefield, not a community. It wasn't necessarily designed to be like that. The players made it that, but things like voice chat were actually added to decrease distrust and make it less risky to hesitate killing. After it's introduction, I think it was thirty something percent decrease in rampant killing. Don't get me wrong, it can absolutely be used to do the opposite by creating a false sense of security. This game is designed for groups, they want you to be social and work with others. 

It feels like something else you're missing is that this isn't a pvp game. It's pvpve. You complain about a lot of aspects that make you think, use strategy, carefully allocate resources,  or basically ever fight your environment. Note also that bag meta is destroyed, bags decay now without a tc near them or a mod to remove the decay (a side effect of no upkeep in tcs also). You mentioned the circle roads limiting space to build on, dude the circle road doesn't work below a certain map size according to how I read it generates. After playing on a 1k, I get the sentiment truly but if you have a ring road, your map has space. The problem may be too many players crammed onto too small of a map at that point. That's not a design flaw, that's an us problem. As far as not being able to build on roads, I admit I miss that but I also understand it's so that vehicles will have an ability to ride the roads. Offroad may not physically be possible in some areas. 

&#x200B;

I honestly agree on some things. One of which being that it would be a good idea to have the ability to play former versions of the game. Perhaps like WoW Classic, or perhaps like Minecraft where servers specialize to a certain version and you launch your game accordingly.  I honestly like that about Minecraft because if I absolutely hate new content, I don't have to play with it. I can't tell you if Rust is headed in the same direction, but they basically took an open sandbox you \*could\* mod and forced you to mod it by updating. I didn't want the foo foo. To be fair instead of cars, they were adding extremely stupid things like bees and foxes and kelp. Again to be fair, some people love those things and use them. Maybe the answer is to allow players to modify the game how they'd like instead of continuing to add pvpve elements to a game largely populated by people that want less pve and more pvp for some reason. Personally again, if I want that I play other games. Pubg for murderbox battlegrounds, BFV for team and goal oriented combat and better gun mechanics, even things like Fortnite if you want limited building and still pvp focus perhaps. If you want mega bases and mega groups and massive pvp, maybe try Ark (though this also comes with a heavy dose of shameless cheaters). I dunno. I just think maybe some of the aspects you want from Rust aren't necessarily the ones the devs are trying to push."

Ehem. Bashierr, I'd like to point out that immunity to this is not guaranteed to last long. It could be weeks, months, maybe a year tops. It might mutate faster than we can build immunity. It's a risky strategy at best, a foolish one at worst. Keep in mind young people can have underlying conditions that make this worse too if they catch it, and from what I understand being a smoker is a contributing factor as well. Something else I'm curious to watch in the coming years, how much damage this does to survivors. Some people are ending up with organ damage if they live, others  (men especially) can be left infertile. In other words, if we just let everyone get infected as you say we may be faced with even more drastic falls in our birth rates. That in itself will have drastic consequences as we end up with fewer young and increasingly aging population. I would also point out that some young people also need to quarantine, again because of underlying conditions but also because we care for the elderly. I'm not leaving home for the foreseeable future. Mom's a picture perfect case of someone who gets this and dies from it. I bought rice before people panicked and we're hunkering down."
