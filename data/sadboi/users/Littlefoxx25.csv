wedding,f9zz2u8,t1_f9ve2gv,1575746866.0,Can really relate to your story. Sounds very familiar :) unfortunately I really take in what people say even though I try not to!
wedding,f9us1sd,t1_f9rzacl,1575656682.0,That’s amazing I’ll use that! Thanks for your reply.
wedding,f9urx1m,t1_f9uo6t3,1575656613.0,If only everyone had that view. We get mistaken for being in our mid twenties due to maturity even though we still look young.
wedding,f9rryy8,t1_f9rrqmu,1575580453.0,"Oh wow! We are April 6th 2020 so actually just hit 4 months to go, time is flying by!"
wedding,f9rrk6c,t1_f9rqwpv,1575580288.0,"Yes I’m preparing myself for some backlash for being young but the only people who have judged us for getting married young are the people who don’t know a thing about us! 

That’s a hard question! There’s so much to be excited and grateful for. We can’t wait to send out invitations and pay the final bills honestly haha. With 5 months to go we are so excited.  

Congrats to you on the engagement too and hope you have a wonderful wedding!"

schizophrenia,f7do7t2,t1_f7dnyn9,1573623024.0,"Thank you so much. I’m from New Zealand :) I am doing okay, my partner is so incredible and makes life enjoyable and fun every day. I have plenty of people to talk to and get support too. I was thinking you shouldn’t tell someone that their hallucinations are real and it seems like a messed up thing for her to do. It’s already real enough for me but I try to keep telling myself that it’s just my disorder.  I was just really angry, upset and shocked at her response"

short,f5ov6wq,t1_f5ouuwk,1572334060.0,He feels fine as long as I’m shorter than him haha I’m 5’2 so there’s not much of a difference but it still counts. He just laughs along with the short jokes and accepts this is who he is. Hes amazing. You’re tall to us!!

schizoaffective,f3w8s3z,t1_f3ttknb,1571194796.0,"A great grounding technique is doing as follows: 
5 things you can see  
4 things you can touch 
3 things you can hear 
2 things you can smell 
& 1 thing you can taste 
It has worked well for me. I’ve also been raped a while ago over the course of 2 years and when I was under 5, don’t hesitate to send me a message if you are needing a vent, a chat, someone to relate to etc. you’re not alone and you’re cared about x"
schizophrenia,f3tfhmm,t1_f3tfapa,1571131693.0,I’ve recently started believing that everyone I see while I go for my daily walks are stalking me and out to get Me. It sucks cause I went for 2 walks every day and now I just want to stay home with all the doors locked unless I’m walking dogs or a friend goes on a walk with me. I started changing up the times and days I go for walks now just to throw off the people who are after me. Thank you for your sharing your personal experience with me friend.

AskReddit,f3p28k7,t3_dhc7vw,1571039329.0,"I was at an interview with a client (I’m a vet nurse student and do dog walking/pet sitting on the side) I was telling them about all my experience with animals from my very animal based upbringing and mentioned how my mum was a professional dog walker/pet sitter for years and they said “what does she do now?” 

My beautiful mum took her life 2 years ago. I feel awful when I have to tell people if they’ve brought up my mum into conversation but I’m trying to accept it’s real and not in my head."
