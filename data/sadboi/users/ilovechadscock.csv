This person was saying behavior is obviously mental states because they’re socially conditioned. That seemed wrong to me. There are extreme behaviors like hallucinations, extreme manic episodes, or dementia that would have to be brain states or biologically based. They’re not conscious actions, so it would seem unfair to categorize them that way."

One case manager/therapist told me I just didn't want to get better when I was mixing alcohol with my medication so I could sleep and didn't care about the consequences.

Another suggested I drink tea in order to sleep. Bitch, I have severe insomnia where I average 2-3 hours a night for over a year and have night terrors because of it. Suggesting tea will help is fucking absurd. 

The worst was when a psychiatrist told me ADHD wasn't real. That pissed me the fuck off."

My functioning has gotten better since starting Latuda in terms of having more motivation to do things and getting adequate sleep, but I’m really bothered by my inability to think clearly. My cognitive issues partly caused me to lose my last job (along with other issues), and have been a major source of anxiety for me. More recently I’ve been suicidal and weepy again. My depression just merely morphs into different forms of depression. I don’t think I can do anything other than part-time."

BipolarReddit,eq7bp3g,t1_eq4mdib,1559843992.0,"Thanks. I do feel better. I just feel kind of moderately depressed, which is basically my baseline. The episode is over for now. 

If I just dealt with mild euphoric hypomania, I wouldn’t mind these episodes lol. I have a mood workbook for bipolar somewhere. I have to try to find it. Most of my stuff is still boxed up. 

I have a couple mood apps, but don’t really care for them very much. I just feel like they’re missing so many mood states I would like to record. 

I’ve decided to take out my retirement, exhaust it, and re-apply to disability in a few months. Even at my baseline, it’s difficult to hold onto a job. And work always exacerbates my stress, anxiety, and depression. Of course, not working feels shitty too, but I think it will be better for me if I get on disability and then work part-time from there."

I have dealt with really arrogant people before that denigrate me. I have managed to both kill them with kindness and get over it, recognizing that their behavior is their problem and not mine, but when you have a mood disorder, sometimes you’re unable to do that shit. Not to mention, it doesn’t always work. Best to address the problem than let it fester, especially since she’s shown a pattern and it’s escalating.

Just curious: What was the condescending question?"
BipolarReddit,epioncr,t1_epbqrk6,1559241565.0,I’m sorry. Have you applied for disability or thought about it?
BipolarReddit,epio0lg,t1_epal574,1559241372.0,"Hi, thank you for your response. I really appreciate it. It was very thorough and thoughtful and you said a lot of the right things. 

I think one reasons I have anxiety job hunting is because I was fired at my last job and put on my resume that I’ve been working as a self-employed consultant so it doesn’t look like I have any gaps. I did very little consulting though. I feel bad about lying and feel nervous about the possibility of my previous termination coming up. These are things I know lots of people deal with, but I can’t get over the anxiety of it. The anxiety is also two-fold. I have experience in other fields that I haven’t been looking at as much. I know I should be broadening my search and applying for anything and everything, but I’ve sucked at every job I’ve had. Looking at other jobs brings up bad memories, and I don’t think I can handle other jobs. I found what I like to do (which was my last job and what I put down as consulting work), but it of course limits my options. 

I’m also always struggling with meds and the symptoms of my illnesses (bipolar, ADHD, and anxiety) always affecting my work performance. I was recently denied SSI. I need to take out my retirement and exhaust it before I can re-apply. Honestly, I think that’s what I have to do. This option also makes me feel like shit though. I’m afraid of being judged for going on disability (if I even get approved). I know I shouldn’t care and sometimes I don’t, but sometimes it really gets to me. I have a few friends and family that understand and fully support my choice. 

I want to give my retirement to my folks (for all the expenses they helped me with over the years), but they advised that will look suspicious to Social Security and I need to get rid of the money in increments. What sucks is that I think it’s unfair I have to exhaust my retirement to qualify and that exhausting it is no guarantee I’ll get approved for disability. 

I’m afraid of people confronting me about why I deleted them. I think I’ll just tell them I haven’t been feeling well and wanted to keep my Facebook only for people I talk to regularly and feel close to, which is close enough to the truth. 

I trued talk to my sister. I tried to explain to her that her unsolicited advice was unhelpful and full of assumptions and made me feel invalidated and judged. She said she understood, then proceeded to give me more unsolicited advice 🤦‍♀️. I asked her to stop. She did. I still felt hurt and full of rage and blocked her and told her why (basically same reasons). Not sure what will happen there. We’ve been pretty close, but she.... really doesn’t listen and misunderstands a lot. 

I feel less actively suicidal, but I’ve been saving my Ambien for when I do make the choice. I see my therapist and doctor in less than 2 weeks. I’ll try to fight this, but I don’t know if I see my life getting much better. In sum, I guess my main issues are the shitty symptoms I have to deal with and the problems it has caused (mainly at work, but also at home and in relationships), the fear of judgment, and the lack of financial independence. 

Thanks again for your thoughtful post."
