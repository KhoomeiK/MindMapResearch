You could still take walks or go for drives or go to the park...not the same as the guaranteed moment of ""how are you"" + small talk you get with a cashier or librarian but maybe there will be other people taking walks or at the park that you can smile at or say hi to from six feet away. I feel like we're all having to reevaluate how we're getting social/interpersonal needs met whether we have mental illness or not.

I tend to self-isolate when I'm in more depressive times or feeling overwhelmed so my challenge is going to be planning to connect with people during this time, even if it's just calling/FaceTiming for a few minutes with nothing much to say, just to hear their voice/see their face.

bipolar,fkwc5w5,t3_fl21mn,1584588525.0,"It depends what the situation is - like, if you and your friend are both able to stay home except for things like groceries/meds/fresh air, that's a lot less of a risk than going to hang out with a friend who has to leave home for work or with a friend who is ignoring social distancing. It's all about reducing the number of chances of contracting/spreading the virus as much as possible. So if you have friends who are able to self-isolate at home and have gone 2 weeks without symptoms (longest incubation time) it's not a big risk. But if you want to see friends who have to leave home for work maybe go to a park or for a hike and stay six feet apart, or if you go to their house be really mindful about touching your face etc. and then act like you have COVID and are trying not to spread it for the next two weeks after that.

Good sleep, good food, a good combo of more direct therapy and just regular relaxation which was therapeutic in itself. 

I would recommend you go in. It sounds like you've tried everything else and you absolutely don't have to suffer for 24 days or even one more.

My experience of it has changed a lot just in the few years that I've been diagnosed. The first two years it really felt like a life sentence but in the past year I've found treatments that really make it feel like a chronic condition that I just have to be mindful of that doesn't take over my life. Even if that's not the case for you at this point in time, life is long - meds are only going to get more advanced, they're only going to do more research about what works, and separate from that things in your personal life/mindset are going to change too. I'm sorry if that just sounds blindly optimistic because I know different people w bipolar have really different experiences, but it's been helpful for me to remember that life is not static.

Other non-black people of color might experience racism it's not the same kind as of that particular word. I think it became widely used because a lot of rap and hip-hop was/is predominantly by black artists and other artists want to emulate them and have some of that aesthetic/image/etc.

changemyview,f3zwt59,t3_dis5eo,1571278865.0,"It is widely used in songs, movies, etc. by black people, in order to reclaim a word used against them. When a black person says it, they are taking the violent dehumanizing power of the full n-word and making it into a positive way of connecting with other black people. It is a reclaiming by and for the people against whom the word has been and is still used. It's not just ""we slightly changed the sound at the end of the word and now it's magically a good thing for all people in all situations ever."" It's ""the world's going to call us this horrible thing in an effort to dehumanize us? We're going to use it among ourselves in a way that's humanizing."" It's similar to the way that LGBT people have reclaimed, among themselves, the word ""f__."" It's a totally different thing to say it as a white/straight person. This isn't an arbitrary distinction. There's no way for them to say it and not be existing and benefiting from a world that still privileges/prioritizes/etc. white/straight people and oppresses black/gay people. It's like saying ""you're fired/grounded"" when you aren't the boss or parent. It isn't the word itself but the context, power/ability, lived experience, etc. of the person saying it. 

When a black person says it they're saying ""I see you, we have this (race/lived experience of it) in common, I am addressing my people who share this with me."" A white person doesn't have that in common. There are so many other words for friend, buddy, etc. You can 'embrace a culture' all you want in certain ways such as dress or music but there is no way to embrace the experience of really being a black person in the US, with all the violence, oppression, history, social reality that that entails. You can call your friends 'n****' among yourselves all you want, that doesn't change the fact that white people benefit from being white and black people in many many ways still suffer for it. No matter what you wear or listen to, you're going to be treated like, and move through the world as, a white person. You're speaking from a totally different place. In your mouth it's a totally different word.

There are a lot of ways to find time/space to write, a good writing community, good mentors/teachers (on and off the page), etc. but a (fully-)funded MFA/PhD offers all of those without having to spend time or effort doing anything else just to have a roof over your head. I think they have been growing in popularity but I don't know if that means they're a fad necessarily. I feel like I have seen more of an emphasis on providing opportunities (funding, mentorships, etc.) specifically for writers without MFAs along with more awareness that there are a lot of fully-funded programs. Funding isn't everything but a partly-funded program where you have to work another job or have family money to get by is a very different environment."

I do also think somewhat about the shit hitting the fan in other ways e.g. large-scale economic collapse or widespread illness. I'm not paranoid about either of those things happening any time soon but it's worth it to me to know my family wouldn't be completely SOL. It's less important to me to be prepared for this or that specific nightmare scenario than it is to just be aware of how much we take for granted for daily survival and have a bit of a backup plan. So the big focus is on getting by at home but our stuff is portable if need be.

We have: ~72 hours worth of water per family member (2 people +1 cat), about a week worth of nonperishables, 2 Lifestraws for drinking from natural bodies of water as well as a downspout extension for collecting rainwater, 2 emergency blankets, a flashlight with radio and USB ports that can be either solar- or hand-crank-powered, candles + lighter + fire starter, first aid kit, vitamins/medications/condoms/menstrual supplies (disposable for short-term emergencies, DivaCup for long-term), wet wipes, some Dr. Bronner's, spare socks/underwear, 2 knives, plastic trowel for digging catholes, compass, laminated maps, camping stove + fuel, 2 mess kits, paracord, some trash bags, a roll of duct tape, a deck of cards...I think that's most of it. Also a tent and two sleeping bags and a cat carrier. If we had more space and money it would be great to do more detailed preparation (especially to have more water) but we at least have our basics covered. Everything but the water, main supply of nonperishables, tent, sleeping bags, and cat carrier, is in two backpacks (which also have some other nonperishable food and water bottles in case we really had to leave immediately for some reason) but it's all in the same closet."
AskReddit,evrm3i8,t3_ckxd8n,1564711970.0,"[7 Cups of Tea](https://www.7cups.com) is great if you can't afford therapy - a website and app for talking with trained listeners for free. It sounds super basic but so much of the benefit of therapy is just having a dedicated space/time to talk through your experiences, issues, concerns etc. with someone who is there only for you. As much as it can help to talk with friends/family, it's nice to be in an environment where there's no worry about ""Am I talking too much, am I a bad friend if I just want to vent and not listen to what's going on in their life right now, what will they think of me"" etc. and to get an outside perspective. 7 Cups does have paid therapy with licensed therapists also but that's a separate thing, but the actual counselors who are involved with the site post lots of articles about different mental health topics which are free to read. There are also forums and chatrooms on different issues including just general support/self-care.

There are all kinds of workbooks written by licensed therapists about different types of therapy/issues that can help give you some of the skills you might learn in therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) are two more general places to start - basically just two sets of skills for learning how to process thoughts/feelings in a productive way, tolerate distress, self-regulate, etc. I have used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Workbook/dp/1572245131/ref=asc_df_1572245131/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=266184041033&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13798993822094107537&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9022863&hvtargid=pla-437102392715&psc=1) and enjoyed it but there are tons. See what your local library has. [TherapistAid.com] (https://www.therapistaid.com) also has a lot of different worksheets about types of therapy/issues/etc.

1500isplenty,erp27o5,t1_erp0595,1561096590.0,"It was good! A thing that seemed weird to me is that I used a bag of frozen veggies from Trader Joe's, which said it had 150 calories in the whole bag or 75 for what's in this picture. That seemed high to me for just veggies but my husband and I were both well under 1000 for the day so far so we just added it to the count. Most of the calories are from the peanut sauce and the faux chicken."
1500isplenty,erp1xtu,t1_eroxnd8,1561096282.0,"It was so good! It was my first time using shirataki noodles and first time making peanut sauce with PB2, and I think it worked out well. For two people, I mixed about 14 T. PB2 powder with about 11 T. water (420 cals total/210 serving) and 1 T. maple syrup (50/25), then added some minced garlic, curry powder, coconut aminos, and plum vinegar to taste. Calories in those are negligible so I just went by taste, maybe between 2 tsp. and 1 T. for each. For the rest I just sauteed a little more than two servings of Morningstar meal starters chik’n strips (320/160) with a little water, a little ginger, and a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies from Trader Joe’s (150/75). I used two bags of Pasta Zero fettucine-style shirataki (30/bag) and just heated them up in the microwave, and then added them and the sauce to the veggies and chicken. Tasted like a meal I would have cooked even when my husband and I were not watching calories :)"
