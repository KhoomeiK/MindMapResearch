I'm also able to think pretty abstractly and come up with some interesting insights.

For example one of the tasks for the group interview portion was to read a journal article that reported on research done that showed that social media use is not linked to depression. Then to discuss in your group how you would support a mother and daughter that comes in and the mother is saying her daughter is depressed due to social media use.

Other people were being very academic and talking about the limitations in the measures used in the study. Talking about potential confounding variables, etc...

I said that I would talk to them, find out what was actually going on and potentially not even bring up the study with them, because what if she was being bullied online and for her own individual circumstances, despite what the research says, social media was making her depressed.

I was also very honest and genuine in the application and interview. I think that made me stand out from all the people trying to be what they thought the interviewers wanted them to be.

There is a lot of research that indicates that rates of bpd decline and those with bpd in later life have reduced symptoms.

Most mental health workers put bpd clients in the too hard basket, so I'm not surprised that you've gotten the message that nothing can be done.

I'm sure some presentations of bpd are so severe that they will be symptomatic to some level across your whole life. But some presentations can definitely improve to the point that they are indistinguishable from the general population.

BPD is such a broad label. With varying symptoms to the point that two people could have almost no overlap in their symptoms and yet still qualify as bpd. It's a bit like saying ""everyone dies from cancer""... well what type of cancer? Some people certainly do. But some people with skin cancer have a 5 minute surgery and then never deal with cancer again in their whole life. It all comes under the label of ""cancer"" but there are widely varying degrees and presentations which impact on recovery rate.

Like I said, one of my clients improved substantially while we worked together. Self harming, drug use, suicidal, no friends only mental health workers, unhealthy/toxic relationships, etc... After a good probably 4 years of counselling her, she had none of those issues. Had real friends. Was finally open to a healthy relationships. Reduced mental health care workers. Got herself a job. Accepted her sexual preferences. Accepted herself. Etc...

I wouldn't let a label predict your future for you."

People definitely grow out of it.

Who told you it was life-long?

I had a bpd client for a few years. She started off with all the classic symptoms. Now she is more well adjusted then most people out there."
relationship_advice,f897fjd,t1_f87qe22,1574368331.0,"I actually wonder if it was just a bad joke. Imagine your partner got a pimple, and they were really self conscious about it. And you thought it was no big deal so you mocked their anxiety by saying  ""oh sure that pimple is so big, you better see a plastic surgeon.""

It's a rubbish joke. But potentially the sort of joke the guys gf was making. And the guy took it the wrong way because of his sensitivity in that area.

Maybe not. But maybe. But lots of possibilities that lead to different conclusions to ""dump her now""."
mentalhealth,f896t27,t1_f887jcs,1574368017.0,"This is why I hate labels. You are you and your situation is your situation. Some label isn't going to tell the full story.

People like to judge others and put them into a box by making a bunch of assumptions.

BPD sucks, but it's hardly a death sentence. People grow out of it. If you've grown 90% out of the bad behaviours and thoughts with BPD, it's a kick in the guts when someone treats you like you haven't grown at all.

The label doesn't tell the full story, so screw those who aren't willing to take the time to understand it."
relationship_advice,f87kxq2,t1_f87j542,1574335944.0,"Lol so true.

People on here instantly say to dump the person no matter what is going on.

""My wife of 30 years just..."" - 

""DUMP HER DUMP HER NOW! WHY HAVEN'T YOU DUMPED HER ALREADY YOU HAVE NO SELF RESPECT. DUMP HER AND THEN DUMP YOUR FUTURE 2ND WIFE TOO BEFORE YOU EVEN MEET HER
 DUMP THEM ALL!"""
mentalhealth,f86702a,t3_dz65x1,1574291259.0,"I love my wife and son more than myself. I find fulfillment and motivation from our relationship. My life as I know it relies on them. If I lost them I would be left a shell of myself.

I don't agree with you, when you say a relationship like mine is toxic because it has some elements of a bpd relationship.

There is a healthy balance to be reached with anything. The right amount of water will allow you to satiate your thirst and thrive. But too much water and you will drown. So is drowning, according to your logic, just the same as drinking a glass of water?

The world isn't black and white, all or nothing. And you shouldn't judge others based on that way of thinking.

I really think that after a decade of being with someone, anyone with a ""take it or leave it"" ""I don't need you for anything"" attitude to the relationahip is a psychopath."

mentalhealth,f7h59q2,t3_dw7fdm,1573732488.0,"When you don't value yourself, you have no point of reference to determine whether or not your partner is valuing/treating you right.

When you don't value yourself, you have a constant fear that others will see how worthless you believe you are and will throw you away like trash.

If you really want things to change, don't look to others to treat you better. Start treating/valuing yourself better and the rest will fall into place."
