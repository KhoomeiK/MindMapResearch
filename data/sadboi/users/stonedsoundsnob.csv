AskWomen,fq9mlwc,t3_ghhleu,1589202353.0,"It is okay to be feminine, to be proud of your appearance, and to enjoy your sexuality. You can do all of those and still be intelligent and professional. You don't have to choose. You can have it all. The only thing is that you must learn that some people are living in the past and they will negate parts of you if they witness certain parts. Some of these people could be your parents, your partner, your boss, your friends. Thread carefully, and remain true to yourself always.

Another thing I was never taught is that society is constantly putting women against other women. Many of us internalize this and it takes work and time to unlearn that notion. We are all human beings, and some people you will simply dislike. That's okay. Just remember, many of us are battling the same fight, and many of us have it much worse. Be kind to other women, and remember they might not know better if they are unkind to you. Don't turn the other cheek, but rise above."
AskWomen,fq9a0xz,t3_gh8awl,1589191021.0,"What I learned is that you should buy staples from the best quality brands, that will last longer, feel and fit better. You mentioned Everlane. You should get jeans and basic teas from them. I know it's an investment, but it pays itself off if you're done growing and won't change sizes dramatically. Other excellent brands are brands you can find in boutique retailers, of course. Zara, Free People, Anthropologie, Nordstrom, Madewell, Lulu's, Levi's, etc. Subscribe to their emails as they have sales rather often, and you can get durable and cute clothes at great discounts. You can also get them used, from Poshmark, Mercari, or your local thrift store. For cute stuff that you foresee using a lot in a season, maybe shop in cheaper places like H&M, Urban Outfitters, Forever 21, Pacsun, Hollisten, Aeropostale, etc. These stores are good at setting trends and their items vary in quality, and you could get a few seasons use out of a single item.

I know it's easier to want to and shop trendy cute clothes, but it's better to slowly build a versatile wardrobe from quality pieces that match together and will last a long time. My friends often ask me how I afford so many clothes, truth is that I've been building my wardrobe for 5 years and counting. I've always had the same style so I purchased pieces that matched that and that fit me well. At this point I have so many clothes that my items last longer because I'm able to rotate them quite a bit. I'm all done with summer shopping, but this fall I'll be purchasing a new coat, a new pair of cute boots, and button down shirts. Next spring I'll buy platform sandals and two sundresses. So on and so forth. Hope this helps!"

AskWomen,foe4m4t,t1_fod3zbr,1587695921.0,"Could be having a stroke, but the party about pity and compassion just doesn't make sense to me. Pity is defined as ""sympathetic sorrow for one suffering, distressed, or unhappy; 2: something to be regretted,"" and compassion is defined as ""sympathetic consciousness of others' distress together with a desire to alleviate it"". Both emotions are meant to be felt externally from what I've always understood, so I'm having a hard time comprehending your differentiation. How does pity involve blame and a call for action? Furthermore, I understand self pity does could end up in misanthropy when directed inwards, because your situation is external and not your fault, so you assign the blame to everyone else instead of taking charge of your reaction and your solutions. But how does it provoke sloth and lack of energy? How does pity involve a call for action?

Excellent input on the other points, however. Feeling annoyed is an easy coping mechanism when facing your emotions is difficult. Either admitting the emotions implies that you care and that you are vulnerable, or perhaps you don't fully understand the emotions because you never had a proper example to observe how to identify and honor your feeling. It took me a very long time to admit people aren't all annoying, I simply didn't want to admit I cared and that I didn't understand the feelings inside me because I never learned how. Once you admit you aren't well versed in your inner emotional landscape, the hard work starts. You learn to identity your emotions, observe why you reacted that way, and decide if that was a healthy way of reacting to the situation. In a lot of cases it isn't, but that's the beauty of consciousness. Your first reaction is what you were conditioned to think/be/feel. Your second reaction, after you processed and utilized all the knowledge you have, is your TRUE reaction. That's who you really are.

It was uncomfortable and lonely at first but you just really gotta push out of your comfort zone."
childfree,flm5k2r,t1_flha3nk,1585275086.0,Thank you for this advice. :)
childfree,flm4ily,t3_fpaxpn,1585274389.0,"Welcome to the club. My boyfriend told me recently that he didn't know if he loves me less since I gave a definitive no. We don't even live together, guys."
childfree,fllcvjt,t1_fll5yye,1585257923.0,That's excellent advice. Thank you.
childfree,flhwdzt,t1_flhsqrg,1585170740.0,"Thank you, that's very thorough and I'll definitely take it into account. :)"
childfree,flf5qvs,t3_fnmfu9,1585098653.0,"I think I want relationship advice from you guys. I have no problems currently, but I'm curious as to what are y'alls relationship standards, besides both parties being child free. What are things you must agree with? What are things where it would be best to compliment each other (opposites attract type features or stances)? What are things that you can be flexible with?"
childfree,flf5ciz,t3_fo73au,1585098394.0,"As much as I love my best friend, her main bingo with me is what beautiful racially ambiguous babies I would make. I'm very unique looking, and some consider me okay to look at, and she uses that to tell me what a waste of good genes I am since I don't want to pass them on. FUCK THAT"
AmItheAsshole,flb64rp,t3_fniztj,1584998163.0,"NTA. I hope you read this response. This is how a parent should act, the way you are acting. My mother used to withhold communication from my father without me knowing, and guess who is dealing with horrible abandonment issues today? Me. 

You are right to share what his father said to him, as your son is the only person that should be making decisions about his relationship with his father. On top of that, you are protecting your son from further abuse and emotional damage by listening to him and what he wants. You are a good mother. Do not doubt yourself."
AskWomenOver30,fl8zdys,t3_fnbrax,1584936325.0,"Do they want to do thing they do with their friends with you? Whatever they are into, if they want to share and are interested in your reaction, most of the time it means they're more interested in you than just for sex."
college,fkqm9m9,t3_fk45yi,1584450149.0,"As an Industrial Design major planning to present my first portfolio (which allows me to move forward to the final 3 semesters of my major) this semester, we no longer have access to CNC, workshops, and labs with software we need. We are screwed, basically. No idea how this will not affect my graduation."
MaliciousCompliance,fkqlyra,t3_fk3vvy,1584449912.0,Gosh that level of pettiness is almost sexual. Love it.
interestingasfuck,fkqio26,t1_fkqb4hi,1584447127.0,"Or a ""fuck everything"" amount of time."
childfree,fkqfu6a,t1_fkqedp2,1584444287.0,"I will be great in the end. My parents are going to help financially if it comes to it. I'm 26, a college student working in food service. I'm immensely grateful for them not leaving me on the streets, and furthering my child free views... I'm far from a failure but fuck supporting someone for 26 years! Pft hell no, not me. Still, thanks mum and dad lol. Besides that, I get to wear PJs to my lectures, and take exams in the comfort of home. And if my relationship fails it's okay because he's still on the fence and I'm not, at all."
childfree,fkqe9hz,t1_fkocel3,1584442499.0,"I just want to quickly thank you for showing me that sub. I perused real fast and honestly I'm so thankful and grateful for my life right now, despite having no income for 8 weeks, my face to face school got cancelled and transferred to online, and my relationship is on the rocks. Seriously any time I feel down or sad from now on, I will keep in mind how shitty other people's lives are by going to check it out. Thank you!!!"
AskWomen,fkk37r4,t3_fiiox5,1584271650.0,This is legit my worse nightmare.
AskReddit,fkk2alw,t1_fkhvei1,1584270529.0,I did it for fun and I liked it way too much. I've never touched it again since.
