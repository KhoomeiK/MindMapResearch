The talk was unproductive and was more of a lecture on his end. He started it off giving me a ""choice"" and ended it by making demands, regarding me having to have a relationship with her.

It isn't changing anything. I'm standing my ground and I realize that it IS my decision. I do feel that it's what's best for me.

His ""talk"" was literally just a lecture, and upon trying to get him to see my side of things, he pretty much told me that I need to get over it because I'm ""going back too far"", AKA ""this happened so long ago so get over it"".

I tried to tell him that I'm done with her and he said he didn't want to hear that attitude because she's done so much for me and the reason he still sees her is to keep the peace, and I need to just ""push through it"". He tried to console me by saying he's been hurt too, but that fell on deaf ears because if he really understands being hurt by her, he should be sticking by my mom and I.

I really tried to talk but I was cut down every time. He tried to use my grandfather against me and everything, to make me feel bad that I don't want to see my grandmother.

It isn't changing my decision. I'm aware he can't force me to have a relationship with her, but damn. I really do have a JNDad issue on my hands too. I'm so hurt and hopeless right now."

I never thought of his actions being abuse, but you're right. The only time I've witnessed him ""protect"" us was when my grandmother attacked my mom and caused the injuries that got us to move out.

I'm currently living with my parents right now. I wouldn't ever see it necessary to go NC with my mom, but I have thought of the possibility with my father once my girlfriend and I manage to get our own place. He has gotten progressively worse over the years and has kind of turned into his mother.

Luckily, my grandmother isn't on any social media. She usually gets information about me through my aunt (her daughter) and sometimes I suspect through my great aunt (her sister), but that's going to be stopped. My great aunt is a good person who doesn't know what we've gone through and doesn't know my situation with my grandmother, so I think any info she might pass along is more rather, ""oh, did you see what SirMissMental did yesterday?"" kind of stuff, so I don't blame her.

My aunt, on the other hand, is just as bad as my grandmother and uses our ""friendship"" on there as a way to see what I'm doing and what I've done. In the past, I would hear the complaints my grandmother would have through mainly my mom, since my dad would tell her. Like, simple hiking trips and me putting the photos on there would spark a complaint out of that woman about how I've ""never liked doing that stuff, so why am I doing it?""

SuicideWatch,fp9qu7c,t3_gc3ygw,1588432617.0,"I don't want to say that I understand, because no one can truly understand what another person is going through. We can relate, but everyone experiences and handles things differently.

These are difficult times and we are in different ships but suffering through the same storm.

This all came at a rough time for me too. Finally after years of the anxiety, the depression, the suicidal tendencies, etc., I was ready to get help. I was ready to go see a doctor and figure my life out. Then everything started getting shut down. I'd just gone through a huge mental relapse, and my courage to finally improve myself ended up being crushed.
I've since also been laid off from my job of 4 years and I have no idea what the future holds. It seems so bleak. Life feels more rocky right now than it has for me in quite a long time.

A lot of people have been telling me that ""everyone is going through this right now"" and ""just stay positive"" and frankly, I don't necessarily like the words. I know there aren't any ill-intentions behind the sentences, but to me, it's rather dismissive. Basically, everything is fine and you're fine because everyone else is going through this stuff too.

Truth is, no one really knows how any one person is handling all of this. We are all different.
Not everything is fine right now. Not everyone is fine either, but that's honestly okay. It's okay for you to not be okay right now. I'd be surprised if you were jumping for joy after experiencing the things you have.

It's okay to be sad, depressed, anxious, and/or angry. It's okay to feel these things. What isn't okay is beating yourself up over it all.
You aren't an asshole, as far as I can tell. Some things are out of your control. If you've emotionally lashed out at people, take some time, a breather, and come back to the situation later. Reach out if you can. Apologize. If the person doesn't come back, that's just another thing you can't control and you can feel the emotions associated with it, but remember that there will be plenty of people who will pass through your life who you can better yourself for.

None of this is your fault. None of this is your doing. You are a human being experiencing emotions because of the sudden events that are going on around you, that are directly affecting you. Again, none of this is your fault.

I'm a bit unstable myself at the moment. It's been hard for me to see the light too. But this storm will clear. It has before, I'm sure, even if the light hasn't fully shown itself yet.

So, please don't harm yourself, as cliche as that plea is. It isn't worth it. The light is through that tunnel somewhere. The tunnel is just a big one with a lot of twists, turns, and blockages. Just keep walking through it at your own pace. When all of this shit subsides, it'll hopefully be a lot easier and maybe you can look into getting some support.

Sorry for the long response. Just wanted to reach out a hand, because I know how alone I feel right now so I can't imagine how you must feel. I don't know you, but I care about what you're going through right now."

I'm glad your initial reaction wasn't to get angry with your daughter for cutting her own hair. That part truly warmed my heart. I've never understood the concept of punishing a child for doing something as simple as cutting their own hair. Strict parenting that even starts to control the length of a child's hair has always deeply disturbed me. I feel it sends a bad message, that they ""own"" the kid and whatnot.

I was also an extremely picky child, to the point where it turned into a food-phobia, and they never really helped me grow out of it. Just kind of gave me what I wanted and that was it. So needless to say, I was never exactly ""skinny"".

I remember one event in the car, I was in the back seat and my parents and I were just having casual conversation.
I want to say I was around 12-ish at the time, perhaps? Maybe younger, but I definitely don't think much older.

I brought up the subject that I had managed to lose about 20-ish pounds since the last time I'd weighed myself. I was proud of myself, since it was over that summer that I began getting self-conscious about my weight; first my ""best friend"" picked on me for it, and then later my doctor did too (this same doctor had once told me I'd never be happy until I lost weight and got skinny).

So, I was expecting some affirmation and encouragement. My mother provided this, but only briefly (as in a solid two seconds), before my father kind of went off the handle about how he couldn't believe that I had weighed that much before and that I ""needed to stop""— I didn't quite understand what I needed to stop, though. Stop eating? 
He said a few other negative things, along the lines of how someone my age shouldn't weigh that much and angrily expressed how I needed to take care of myself. He was overall just visibly frustrated with me and his hands were flailing about.

I was 12. Roughly. I knew how to use a treadmill and I always rode my bike outside, but my eating habits were the same and I didn't know how to change them. With no support from him, of course, who not to mention, has never been ""skinny"" or ""fit"" in my entire lifetime.

I cried silently in the backseat for the rest of the ride. I felt horrible about myself, like I was disgustingly fat. It was that moment that really validated the way I had been feeling about my weight. It's still something I struggle with to this day, and one of many reasons why I virtually have no self-esteem.

Anyway, apologies for the long response. In short, yes, I did experience a form of this treatment as well, and because of the issues I dealt with (not just from him), it did turn into an eating disorder. I agree that no one, especially a child, should be looked down on for such a thing when they truly don't know any better."
