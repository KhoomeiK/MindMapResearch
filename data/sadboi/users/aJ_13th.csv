- Goblin: it's treated as the legendary drama. Some people have their reasons to dislike it as I have my reasons to love it. It reminded me that I'm alive.


- Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo: a really light young adult rom-com around college life, having professional goals and fitting private life goals in between. With Nam Joo Hyuk and Lee Sung Kyung. 


- Strong Woman Do Bong Soon: this one has another special personal message; women are strong on their own, no matter how you treat them. Really sweet couple but with a dark plot. Starring Park Bo Young and Park Hyun Sik. 


- Fight For My Way: a melodrama about achieving in life and finding love in the ones who're already beside you. Really light and sweet. 


- He Is Psychometric: I watched this one at first because of Park Jin Young, he's my boy you see. But it made me love the genre; thriller, psychology, suspense with a tint of law. 


- Touch Your Heart: another light rom-com with Lee Dong Wook and Yoo In Na after being unsatisfied of seeing them from Goblin. Around law. An actress who go on the field to actually learn because she wants to keep on with her actress life but finds love in the process. About bettering yourself. Most of Lee Dong Wook is one of my top favorites.(not Blademan tho) 


- Watcher: one of the few action, suspense, police drama I've watched and really loved. No romance at all in this one. With a lot of plot twists that keep making you change your decision on who's the actual culprit at the end of every episode. With Han Seok Kyun, Seo Kang Joon and Kim Hyun Joo. 


- When The Weather Is Fine: family drama melodrama with slow burn romance with a ""just right"" vibe. Not in your usual busy life Seoul. Quite inspiring, especially if you love books. With Seo Kang Joon and Park Min Young.


- Her Private Life: one of the best rom-com I've watched so far! Starring Kim Jae Wook and Park Min Young. Around art with a bit of family drama as subplot. They have a really mature relationship which is unique for a rom-com."
