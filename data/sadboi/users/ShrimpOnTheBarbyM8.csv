MadOver30,fr5i6xp,t3_glnn6c,1589908968.0,"Only 19 right now, but been feeling worthless since middle school. Just had sort of an emotional breakdown and on reddit teary eyed seeking consolation...i know pathetic as a guy. Cant say a kid like me has any advice for you. Sending you my blessings though."
SuicideWatch,fqlo3da,t1_fqkkb2c,1589462704.0,Exactly and good for them they don't have to suffer this pain. But it really takes experiencing it to understand it truly as with anything. That's a con in itself.
SuicideWatch,fqlnr75,t1_fqkk6hs,1589462498.0,I agree; that never really was a deterrant for suicidal thoughts for me. Rather my suicidal thought lessened when i became as brash and honest as possible and decided to live for myself. Though there would definitely be people affected by my death i simply didn't give a fk when I was in that state of mind.
SuicideWatch,fqln8l6,t3_gjad8l,1589462173.0,"Seems harsh but very few people in this world are willing to give a shit about your depression. That's just the way humans are, the majority of us are asshats. That is not to say good people don't exist; they do and they're out there.

Also people give advice based on what worked for them. Maybe it doesn't work for you, who knows, but try to not let your ego get in the way and dismiss their advice. I found out during my recovery period that ego held me back from learning, and we must learn to know the truth, even if the means of learning is pain. I hope i made sense here and I hope you got something out of this."
depression,fqh2iwh,t1_fqd11op,1589365597.0,"Hey, glad that you got something out of this; i believe you got this in the same way i believe in myself; life isn't long enough to be spent in depression. Have a good day or maybe night:)"
Tinder,fqh1yq0,t1_fqgmjf3,1589365042.0,"I'm not seeing where thats happening in this, is the negging the girl saying ""as long as its not with you"". Couldn't that be her being super sarcastic?"
depression,foxyp36,t1_fovsok2,1588160643.0,Yeah and finding habits and sticking to them also helped for me. Perhaps cold showers work in a similar way.
depression,foxyk0w,t1_foxq0fg,1588160523.0,"Find something you enjoy and gives you tons of mental stimulation. For me that is talking to a certain friend and gaming. Also try to be as logical as possible, imagine you're a rocket scientist or something; be brutally honest in everything. And notice when you're being negative; awareness is the most important. That's what i did basically but i hope you can take something from that:)"
depression,foxy790,t1_fouin9h,1588160214.0,"I feel you, I ""stopped living"" at 17 as well (I am 20 now), though i'd say the process began way back when i was 13-14. I've always been super critical of myself and i believe that is why i began spiralling into depression. I've only recently escaped this by acting as apathetic, whimsical and ""critical"" as possible and that somehow lead to me finding things i enjoy. I still get an emotional breakdown every now and then but thankfully i've been getting back on my feet. 

All i can say is realise that 1:life isn't meant to be taken seriously and 2: try to be as logical as you can; argue with your negative thoughts and write them in a journal. It's been a 2 year process but i wish everyone the best and hopefully I can fully pull my mind out of this hole. Peace."
