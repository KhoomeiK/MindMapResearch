Please understand that the ‚Äúworld wide web‚Äù as it is, can be a very powerful tool and helpful and support system.

My grandfather helped innovate a lot of computer systems with a large company that I‚Äôd rather not name, as well as with the ‚Äúwww‚Äù.  And in His spirit, he would never want anyone to be left behind. 

What is important and to the point I guess is: there are are sooo many people in the world that understand and relate to you; my grandpa would have, he struggled with depression. I do as well. And there are countless of us out there...,However, I know that  he would appreciate and understand, and probably relate to what you have had to say.
