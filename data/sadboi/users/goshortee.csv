‚ÄúHong Kong is a fast-paced city. Besides the beautiful waterfront, let us slow down our pace of life and feel the surprises of the city.

Mr. Tai Yau On, from On Tai Mini Workshop is a miniature crafter. With the theme if miniature art, he sets up a volunteer group, ‚Äúmini movements‚Äù, and organizes volunteers to bring and share his work with people with disabilities. By conducting visits to schools and other education institutions, they are promoting the miniatures to the younger generation in Hong Kong as well.

With the direction of ‚ÄúGrow from the Earth, Our Home‚Äù, On Tai has created miniature paviours for the Victoria Harbour. On Tai hopes to retain the most beautiful moment of Hong Kong through the miniature art and allow members of the public and tourists to stay and enjoy the ‚Äúhomes‚Äù of the promenade. On Tai has promised to provide new artworks and creative inputs in the near future. That‚Äôs definitely something we are looking forward to!‚Äù

I have been in a relationship for the past 7 months (after an incredibly long time being single, ~9 years) and I have been noticing that literally every cycle I am unbearably moody and I feel like I have no control over it. The depression that inevitably comes with it is almost crippling; I have a hard time getting out of bed, I don‚Äôt have any desire to make human contact or even eat anything, and sometimes it even goes as far as my brain wandering towards suicidal thoughts. In such a short time I have been on the verge of breaking up with my bf at least 3 times, only to snap out of it and everything goes back to normal.

I have very bad anxiety and exhibit a lot of symptoms of PMDD, and I feel like it‚Äôs only a matter of time when he breaks up with me. 

Yesterday I had an episode of freaking out that resulted in us not speaking for the rest of the day, but thankfully we decided a few days ago that we would spend today apart (we don‚Äôt live together).

This has made me realize that maybe I need some time away from him to be able to gather my thoughts and compile them in words where I can explain to him what is up and hopefully the next time this happens he will know that there is more to it than just being shitty.

Thanks for sharing your story, I‚Äôm happy to know that someone else out there has experienced the same thing. 

I hope everything gets better with you ‚ù§Ô∏è"

datingoverthirty,fcjpw1i,t3_ehirjf,1577698647.0,"happened to me in my last long-term relationship (which was about 9 years ago, oof). 

we were together for 5 years, lived together for 4 and had gone through so many ups and downs, the biggest one being the year that my father and both of my grandparents on my mom's side had passed away. in retrospect i probably wasn't the most stable person to be around during those times, but i guess my antisocial behaviour probably drove him to want to be with someone else, which i found out about through mutual friends roughly a year into their secret relationship.

he's now married and has a baby with said ""other woman"" and i've since moved on and had several moments where i was convinced i was going to be a spinster forever because every single person i dated ghosted me at some point, or was just around me for some sort of benefit that i could provide them.

now i'm finally in a relationship with someone who actually gives a shit about me, and this person has actually been my best buddy for the past couple of years before we decided to maybe try dating (also, alcohol helped fuel us sharing our feelings a bit better lol). yeah, i know it's 9 years later, but those 9 years gave me a lot of clarity into what i want from a relationship and what i don't want, and to not settle for anything that doesn't jive with me. it's also taught me how to be a more patient human.

i guess what i'm trying to say is the universe will always know what is best for you, but you just need to weather the storms. actively seeking will make you blind to what lies around you that is actually perfect, you just gotta be at peace in your own heart first."
