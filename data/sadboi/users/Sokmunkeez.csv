YouShouldKnow,fqemhyb,t3_ghy5vg,1589310009.0,Licensed insurance agent here.  Not true.  Your glass coverage or comprehensive coverage in states without stand alone glass coverage takes care of this.  On the off chance you can 100% prove who did it the insurance company could possibly go after them to recoup their loss.  Also of note a comprehensive claim will not affect any rates.

I used backyard sticks for tree trunks.  I purchased a mix of mosses to use as ground cover and as the tree tops.  I used crayola air dry clay to make the bases for the trees, and painted them green.  I purchased gravel from the minatures department to get the correct scale for the path.  For the mirror I had it cut to order at Loews (before any quarantine- this project took me a long time). And for the lights I purchased a led light string made from vines.   I forgot to put in the little red mushrooms I made!  And I definitely feel like I should have some taller trees.  I may tweak it a bit.  But overall for a first try I feel like it‚Äôs ok."
bipolar2,fn6e2xm,t3_fzqkeq,1586696711.0,I‚Äôve only been on it about 3-4 months. I started at 100mg and now am at 300mg. It helps me sleep through the night. I get a solid 8-9 hours. I don‚Äôt wake up groggy or anything.  I‚Äôm going to state the obvious and mention that it should be taken in the evening.  All I can offer is that everyone reacts differently to meds. I would highly suggest you reach out to your prescriber and discuss how it‚Äôs making you feel. They might be able to recommend another drug that won‚Äôt make you so sleepy all the time. I know it can suck until you find what works for you. Adjusting to meds is such a process.  Best of luck.
