SuicideWatch,f0gz26g,t1_f0e4gqy,1568609303.0,I feel exactly the same. I would never regret doing it. I want to die and no longer be in pain but the idea of somehow surviving an attempt and living like that is the only things keeping me alive. Knowing how much I screw up everything else in my life I would screw up killing myself and be even more useless to everyone around me.
SuicideWatch,eyspjz7,t3_cyfpuu,1567407364.0,I feel you. My friends either think I’m joking or say no you’re not. Jokes on them it’s all I can think about at night and wish to not wake up in the morning.
SuicideWatch,exndd3y,t3_ctra3j,1566452533.0,I feel the exact same way. I’m already enough of a burden on those around me I’m too afraid if I mess it up that I’ll end up being even more of a burden to them.
