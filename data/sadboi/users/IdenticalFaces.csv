I love phionix but hus biggest cases he either gets lucky or soneone bsiks him out (a lot of those times by edgeworth) i mean i know edgeworth gas some dumb moments but edgeworth could have kept up his job (minus being accused of murder and having his realisation he is a douchebag). Not that pheonix is a complete moron but edgeworth seems the more independent one. I haven't played past the trilogy so maybe theres something i am missing. Plus edgeworth seems to have a much more successful career whereas pheonix always seems on the edge of going under, meanwhile edgey is off being an international prosocuter and is obviously really well off."
