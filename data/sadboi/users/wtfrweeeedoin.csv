After our governor announce 2 more weeks of quarantine and bad day working from home, I'm honestly crushed, and angry, and alone, and a bit crazy.  Pretty broken. Your understanding and grace gave me just a bit of wind. Much appreciated. Hang in there. Not sure how we're going to make it, but one thing is for sure. We've seen these kind of dark days before. We can do this. We all make mistakes. Forgiveness is what really matters for us and for others. <3 Much love."

BPD,fn8t8sx,t1_fn87461,1586749646.0,"Not sure if you belong here, but us Borderlines' have a tendency to define ourselves by what's going on outside of us. If that does not reflect back to us the way we try to shine it out, we become despondent, petulant, aggressive. Also, some of us may feel completely defined by others in our life, so for instance, your rebuke of the above, would be felt deeply and we might never talk to you again. Maybe that would be for the better. Maybe not. My larger point is, ""One of these folks might not belong on a BPD subreddit."" This is for support for us. It is not a petri dish for you to dissect maniacally with a self-righteous tone. Oh yeah, and we can be very expressive too."

BPDrecovery,fn3ykv7,t3_fz3n1f,1586630471.0,"I think you said it when you said you realize you are fluid. For me, it is most important that my identity does not shift to the person who just walked in to the room. I am now resistant to others telling me why my thoughts and emotions are not healthy, valid, or sane.  They are thoughts. We all have them. Emotions, we all have them, my caution is in getting too attached. I can now shift between thoughts, emotions and reality; looking at things from different angles, which is what I believe is a more human and compassionate approach than the rigidity I used to get stuck in. As a heterosexual woman, this resistance to others defining me is particularly problematic because most men are trained to fix women. They seem to be tuned in to sniffing out a problem and attacking it. They do not respond well to my independent view. Either way, I can leave a point of view to explore a new one, and I sometimes have to be aware not to attach to anything extreme. 

&#x200B;

On the other hand, Honestly, I do struggle in the current pandemic and have been more stuck than I have become accustom to. Anyway, I digress. We are all moving pieces on a board. The classic problem, to me, seems to be in getting stuck on one spot on the board. While I have developed moral stances and intellectual points of view that I deeply agree with, I can also let my behavior shift with circumstance and adapt in an almost normal capacity. Not sure how much of this makes sense to you, but who I am is beyond definition, while what I believe can be roughly sketched, but finally, as a borderline, how I act it where I practice, every day. That will always be my achilles heel. Maybe this helps a little to ease up on the gas when it comes to rigidly nailing down a ""persona."""

I highly recommend DBT, yoga, meditation and maybe some individual therapy. With some discipline and time, you will find that you will not be as connected to your emotions that are hooked in to outward validation. You will find a peace within you, once you are able unplug from the emotions and thoughts; to simply let them pass on the wind without holding on to them.
