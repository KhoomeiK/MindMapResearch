One thing that could be happening is you’re not getting the overall spoke tension tight enough. This is tricky because you also don’t want to overtighten your spokes because that will lead to spokes breaking.   

There’s tools to measure spoke tension although they can be expensive. They’re called tensiometers.

exmormon,fqon0n6,t1_fqoh09d,1589519184.0,"Here’s what little I know:

Tequila is made from the distilled, fermented juices of the agave plant

Blanco (or Silver) tequila is clear and hasn’t been aged very long. This is typically what’s used in mixed drinks like margaritas

Reposado tequila has been aged up to a year in oak barrels which gives it a smoother flavor and gives it an amber color

Anejo tequila is aged from 1 to 3 years in oak barrels so it becomes even smoother and darker in color. This is stuff you typically use for sipping either neat or with an ice cube or two

Extra Anejo tequila is aged more than 3 years and gets really pricey but obviously the flavors will be best

Make sure the tequila you buy says 100% Agave on it and don’t get the cheap stuff and have fun!

There was a really beautifully-filmed documentary on Netflix called Agave that’s interesting to watch, but I don’t see it available anymore. Maybe someone else knows of a source"
CatSlaps,fqo7yik,t1_fqnvvvd,1589509430.0,"Hey I’m going to try to comment to try and discuss the issue but I understand if it doesn’t go over well 

The facts are that Pitbull mixes account for 7% of the dog population yet contribute to about 75% of dog attacks. In the last 12 years they have killed about 275 people. Compare that with the next most lethal breed the Rottweiler which has killed about 45. This doesn’t even mention the attacks that change lives for the worse even if not fatal

I will totally admit that your dog is perhaps not one of those, nor are the vast majority of Pitbulls actually and most go on to live normal, uneventful lives but the fact remains that this aggression and violence that they are capable of can not be trained out of them. Of course a well-trained Pitbull might be less likely to attack but there are many, many cases of this breed attacking unprovoked even after a lifetime with no issues. 

I would put forth that we simply don’t need this breed in our society, where even a chance of a human injury is not worth the life of any dog. (And I love dogs but no dog’s life is more valuable than a human’s)

There are so many other breeds out there that need good homes where the owners won’t have to live wondering if they will ever be responsible for the attack of their dog

I would imagine that your pup is probably a great dog and I’m sure you love them and that is wonderful. I would simply suggest that in the future the breed should be banned. Current owners could have their pets grandfathered in so they can keep them as long as they are neutered/spayed and then when the sad time comes that they pass away, simply don’t get another one. There’s so many breeds out there that need loving homes that there’s no need for them to cause another single human death. All the best"

holdmyfeedingtube,fqnzhrd,t1_fqnz1sw,1589504485.0,"I keep trying to emphasize that yes, the kid should not be riding a bike and therefore probably shoulders some of the fault, but my argument as I initially wrote is that he doesn’t shoulder *more* of the blame as you state. If the driver had been following the law and not proceeding until they could see that the crosswalk was clear, then no one would’ve been hit regardless of whether the kid messed up. In the situation you just stated, if a driver is following the law and slowly proceeding through a crosswalk (especially while it’s obvious that other cars are stopped for pedestrians) there should have been plenty of time for the driver to stop. 

Edit to add: maybe it would help to mention that the kid isn’t riding out into the middle of traffic in an unmarked portion of the street. It’s a crosswalk and he’s a kid.

Damnthatsinteresting,fq3hvlx,t1_fq2olqu,1589066618.0,"Ok I’ll bite and explain a little more in-depth. 

There are 2 elements to making this image appear to be 3D. One is just the shape of the cube itself as shown on a 2D surface. Think of a cube drawn on a piece of paper. If still has the illusion of depth although it is on a flat sheet of paper. That is however still 2D

The next element that is giving the illusion of 3D is the fact that the spinning LEDs displays to us an image, yet we can’t see the ‘screen’ because it is spinning faster than our eyes can detect. Similar to an airplane propeller that is in motion. This makes the image appear to float in mid-air and allows us to see behind the image and tricking our mind into thinking it’s a 3-dimensional object floating in space

It’s not. If you were to view the image from the side (or on edge) you would see that it’s completely flat and therefore 2D. 

The definition of a hologram is it needs to be an image that is 3D and can be viewed from any angle. I hope that makes more sense"

AmItheAsshole,fputuvf,t1_fpusvgv,1588923519.0,"Very well thought-through and articulated standpoint and I agree with you. While reflected on your position I’ve kind of realized my argument has less to do with the actual financial support OP and her mother received and more to do with the overall ‘support’ (or lack thereof) that was given her. 

I feel like it was wrong of the ex-wife to take on the view of OP as the ‘failed-abortion’ and thereby most likely the source of the sister’s feelings of superiority and constant bullying. 

I recognize that it would be extremely difficult for a woman to not see the child of her ex-husband’s affair as a constant reminder, but OP is blameless in all this. 

I guess to make the best of a horrible situation I would have liked to think the best way out of it would have been for the ex-wife to respect that OP and her mother were not to blame and not raise your daughter to see them as the reminder of the affair but rather that they are all victims in this and only the father was to blame."
AmItheAsshole,fpusz95,t1_fptpnpz,1588922664.0,"I disagree with this although obviously I think it’s extremely difficult for the ex-wife to do other than what you describe. 

It’s somewhat along the lines of this type of situation: wife walks in on her husband cheating on her with another woman. This other woman has no idea the man she’s sleeping with was married. The wife could easily start taking out all her aggression on ‘the other woman’ despite this woman being absolutely blameless, having had no knowledge of the man’s marriage, or she could see the truth that her husband is completely to blame for his betrayal of his wife and family. 

It’s makes it even more difficult in OP’s case because she is the result of this betrayal, yet still, she and her mother are blameless and the ex-wife could if she wanted to, sympathize with their predicament and acknowledge that it’s is all truly the husband’s fault. 

I recognize that this is extremely difficult to be the better person but the alternative is what’s happened here. A child left feeling unwanted by her father her whole life. A sister who flaunts her ‘legitimacy’ in her face her whole life. An ex-wife who throws blame where she shouldn’t. Grandparents being forced to choose between doing the right thing or continuing the abuse with one of their granddaughters. 

It all points back to the father as the real person to blame and for everyone else to recognize that and at least sympathize with everyone else plight"

Don’t get me wrong, ex-wife and her daughter and everyone else are also victims, but how could a child not grow resentful towards a father who didn’t love her and never even gave legally obligated financial support? How could a child not grow resentful at a sister with a superiority complex that touted her ‘legitimacy’ all while having money, house, college tuition, and then finally all the life-insurance payout? Could she really be expected to not tell her own grandparents about the cruel treatment from her own half-sister after all she had endured her whole life?

AmItheAsshole,fpumcl4,t1_fpujfl2,1588916808.0,"This type of thinking puts the blame in the wrong place. The father is the absolute asshole by cheating and unfortunately an innocent child came from that. You can talk about birth control and abortion as what should have been the ‘solution’ til the end of the world, but unfortunate things happen and OP is not to blame

This is the kind of thinking where if you walked in on your significant other cheating and the other woman knew nothing about you and him being together, yet you would start antagonizing the other woman rather than the actual person who is to blame, which in OP’s case would be her father. 

There have been plenty of these types of situations where the abused (both mothers and both daughters) could come together and unite in sympathy for one another against the cheating, child-neglecting father rather than wrongfully putting blame on each other."

Since you know the length of your headtube, you’ll add the ‘stack height’ of your stem, plus any spacers you’d like underneath the stem to get your final preferred stem height

Keep in mind you’ll need the top of the steerer tube to be 2-3mm below the uppermost stem/spacer surface to be able to preload your headset

Also keep in mind sometimes the crown race takes up another few mm of your steerer tube length"

depression,fpczvlz,t1_fpcz5w8,1588516774.0,"I think it’s pretty normal to use metaphorical language to convey emotion. ‘Killed-off’ can definitely be used to describe the lack of interest and passion that commonly happen when someone is suffering from depression

The whole point of this subreddit is to be able to express feelings and share difficult situations that people are having concerning depression

I don’t think accusing someone of ‘attention-seeking’ merely because they’re hurting and expressing themselves is a good thing to do in this place"
depression,fpczf81,t3_gcocye,1588516484.0,"It sounds like at the very least you’ve got some emotionally abusive surroundings. It’s going to be very hard to get out of your depression in that environment. I’m not saying to go no contact with your family just yet, but maybe try to solidify what it is you want and approach them about working on it. If you’re not in therapy, consider it and making some goals as to what steps to take to make progress towards healthier relationships. 

If this doesn’t work with your family then at least you start to stand up to the abuse which will encourage you and give you a sense that you’re moving forward and if they aren’t interested then you can leave them behind in good faith that you did your best"

mountainbiking,fp881ny,t1_fp6kd8u,1588385852.0,"Slack (headtube angle) is the term for when the front axle is raked further forward and yes, typically gives you more stability at high speed and when descending steep terrain. The disadvantage is more effort required to steer in slower/climbing terrain, and less agility or maneuverability

Steep is the opposite where the front axle is raked further backwards. This gives you easier/quicker steering in slower, tight-handling terrain with the disadvantage of less stability at high speed and descending steep terrain. It will feel ‘twitchy’ in that type of terrain"

Opal,fp50lz4,t1_fp4ynsi,1588312564.0,"You might have a little misunderstanding about this type of Opal. If I’m understanding you correctly, it’s not solid ‘blue’ throughout. The blue part that you see is pretty much the entirety of the Opal. 

It’s called Boulder Opal and the blue color you see was once voids in the underground. The voids were very thin cracks underground. Over eons, water containing silica collected from the soil slowly deposited that silica in the cracks as the water seeped downwards. That is now the blue Opal color. It’s very thin seams of Opal material. When the boulder rock is mined, they typically split this with a hammer and it naturally cracks open on the seams of Opal. This is the best way to do this because the Opal is so thin that if you tried to cut away just the boulder material you really wouldn’t be able to display the Opal very well in the traditional sense of cutting and polishing as you can other types of regular Opal. 

I hope that explanation makes sense and check out Broken River Mining on Instagram or YouTube to see videos on the process of splitting Boulder Opal open

edit: here’s an example of a Boulder Opal being split open. You can see before they strike it with a hammer, the vein of Opal is very thin only 2-3mm thick
