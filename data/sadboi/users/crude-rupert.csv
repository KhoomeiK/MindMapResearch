So I don’t know if its the song I was listening to or my mood or the girl, who I now think I’m in love with, or maybe the background, which reminds me of a childhood memory I can now only recall emotionally, or the colours or the sunset or what but I just had the most visceral connection to this painting. I felt something so deeply and intrinsically good, And it doesn’t even matter that none of it is real because I’ve memorised that feeling and I don’t think I will ever forget it. I honestly believe the few moments I had that feeing will be memorialised next to memories that form my core and will be something I will continue to revisit decades to come and possibly for the rest of my life.  
So thank you. Thank you so much for this."

What I did notice, however, was that I was a little more irritated than usual. My psych said it could be from the meds or just because I wasn’t used to having increased dopamine and norepinephrine activity. It died down after a while. Nearing the 1 month mark I started feeling less irritated. I only stopped it because it wasn’t completely helping me with the depression. I see though that you are reaping benefits, keep it up!"

I found that sometimes its not okay or enough of someone to just say that they’ve been through worse or something else that is ignorant enough to make things worse for you. I stopped talking to some of my friends because they had all these preconceived notions and attitudes about mental health and would never listen to what i had to say about it so whatever help that came out would always make me fee worse and was attached to the notion that maybe i was just weak or incompetent, even though they never explicitly said it. In situations like that, its better to leave them, I can’t condone or accept help that is just a string of phrases from a place of ignorance. At that point they’re not really trying to help, they are just saying what they think."

It’s frustrating. But its gotten better for me. Before, it used to be that I would believe all of the thoughts and that was destroying. Now I can recognise that they’re wrong and as am often caught between them and rational thinking. Ive learned that, for me, they’re linked to schemas; mistrust, fear of abandonment, unlovabilty etc. I did abit of research on schemas and found it to be very helpful. Apparently, you can’t get over your schemas, you can only dull them down and/or put up constructs to help you combat them. So the fact you can recognise that they’re there is good in a sense."
