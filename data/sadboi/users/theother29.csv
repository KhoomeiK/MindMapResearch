 The loss of control over them as they grow can be very scary in some ways and quite hard to relinquish and I admit I have been to the end of my tether and back and got cross and shouty. An apology from me would be accompanied by a cuppa tea and a sit down though. Because I'm a parent, not a fascist dictator"

I reckon thinking about it every day, especially if it's a sudden thought pattern or one that has followed a trauma, or has appeared out of nowhere or if you are making plans and preparations, needs some intervention.
Actually if you are just feeling the world would be better without you in it, you need to open up and talk to someone professional.
Yeah go see your doc."

LifeProTips,eqd8etz,t3_by2y47,1559985325.0,"When I adopted my Sweety girl from a Romanian rescue (6kg corgi/spitzer/whatevs mix) I made so many preparations for a barky non house trained non lead trained dog. Instead I got a quiet ( we literally lol if she ever tries a bark, its so funny) easily trained and well mannered dog who trots politely at heel mostly.

my feeling is that its because she was a stray dog, rather than a problem hound, so used to a pack and knows her doggy manners with other dogs, and that this was a transferable skill to living with a family.

The day I met her was the day she arrived; had it been problematic there was a foster aftercare service by the charity in this country (UK) ready to swoop in and help, also  strict pre adoption criteria and visits.

God I love this dog!"
