It takes a lot and I mean years to chisel through that rock hard wall that tells you that you are the one living the wrong life but it's not true! Get out so you can be happy, it is a desctructful religion and will ruin your mental health. I suggest talking to a therapist once you get out.

He definitely gets annoyed when I start talking about my classes and has told me down right that he's getting bored and this is after he asks me about it. I think he resents it and it pisses him off because it reaffirms in his mind that I don't want to be a JW and never will be again.

Thank you it's nice to hear that from someone. It should be a life long journey. He's so paranoid that I'm not going to die because his beliefs say I do.

I'm sorry that you have been through so much with drugs and alcohol. I've lost family to both and friends, it's a really rough road I imagine.

I've heard before that it helps bringing the deceased cat to the remaining cat so that they can properly grieve. Is this a possibility or is he already cremated? If you're not sure the vet did it yet, give them a quick call and ask if you could bring your car over to just sniff and check him out. It would also probably be great if you brought in another cat into the household, maybe a kitten? Or maybe you could adopt an older male cat that is more on the alpha side since your cat seems to be more shy. He will help your cat come out of his shell.
