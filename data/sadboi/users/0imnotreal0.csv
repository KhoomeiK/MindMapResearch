The delayed onset of the effects of SSRI’s is thought to be due to a slow metabolic response of serotonin autoreceptors. Autoreceptors are involved in the regulation of a given system; so that serotonin autoreceptors are involved in regulating the release and uptake of synaptic serotonin.

While most of the receptors we talk about when discussing brain chemistry are fast-responding (ionotropic) receptors, autoreceptors (which are metabotropic) function in a different way and on a different timescale. 

The fact that autoreceptors help to regulate from within the system and are slow-to-change metabotropic is likely an underlying factor for the slow-going process of regulating the serotonin system.

[Here’s a recent human study discussing autoreceptor desensitization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690146/)

AskReddit,fetr0ce,t1_fep55sk,1579378604.0,"To your first point, that is true but it ignores the fact that once the process is started, a lot of students are locked into it by family and social pressure. It doesn’t feel like repeated loans to a student, it feels more like one 4 year commitment. That’s how the package is sold, and that’s how our educational system approaches it. 

Young people have the opportunity to educate themselves, sure, but it’s not an opportunity made accessible by the educational system itself. Which is a big part of the problem. There is a very intentional marketing strategy to student loans that students are largely blind to until after the fact.

I agree totally with your second point. Part of the problem is lack of education - but remember, this is the same educational system we’re giving money to that is depriving students of the information. High school curriculum isn’t developed independently of higher education - colleges work with high schools and high schools design educational programs to suit colleges. There’s a great deal of bureaucratic overlap.

The argument I’m making is not as simple and naive as “it’s not my fault because they didn’t teach me.” That’s not what I’m saying, and of the people I’ve spoken to who agree with me, that’s not what they’re trying to say, either. To dumb it down to that point seems invalidating of the more complex issue we’re trying to discuss.

You’re last point is fine with me, too. I agree, but the reality is that most students, who have lived under the wing and guidance of their parents their whole life, trust the adults they’re dependent on. Or, even if they don’t trust them (such as myself), they’d lose all family support if they didn’t go to college. There’s pressure there that is separate from the educational system and is directly tied to our educational culture.

All of these experiences are very real and rather complicated. It’s not just “you should have done x, y, and z, and you’d be fine.” Hindsight is always 20/20."
