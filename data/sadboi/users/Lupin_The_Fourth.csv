You can get your supply from a different company but that means paying two separate bills instead of having it in one (if you don't mind) but you can save up to 10% by switching suppliers. I switched suppliers this month. Eversource is charging 11.66cents  per kWh you can find a supplier that charges 8.80cents per kWh that's a substantial savings. Depending on how much you use it can be $30 dollars or $80 dollars. I wish the city had an agreement with them to buy electricity at a lower cost like Chicopee and Holyoke do. That is one thing that sucks about living here. Electricity is wicked expensive if you are a home owner.
