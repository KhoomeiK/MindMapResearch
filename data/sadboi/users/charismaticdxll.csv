Only I know that, and I can decide who I want to be. Life isnt worth putting the thoughts and words of other people into mind. At this point in my life (I'm 19), I decided I want to live a stress free life and just focus on me and affirm myself. Sometimes I even get affirmations from those close to me. But you gotta learn to take things day by day. Lots of love and support from me. 💕"

I'm honestly going through a lot emotionally, and it's hard to validate myself just because other people are going through worse things. But my feelings are real, and what I'm going through emotionally is hard. I appreciate the compassion. I wish you the best too 💕"

depression,fkzpp3r,t1_fkzp8ce,1584676875.0,"It was really our first fight, and it was over me wanting him to put more effort and pay more attention to me. I'm not like crazy and require hours beyond hours of love and affection.. But I missed a lot of the intimacy we've had and shared, and I ended up blowing up and spiraling. (I have BPD and he KNOWS I have BPD.) I'v e never like snapped at him, and the thing that got to the most was that he was defensive and minimizing my feelings. He said after our fight he lost feelings romantically, and I respect and understand why. I can't make someone love me or have someone believe me when I say it won't happen again. After our fight I worked through a lot of healthier coping skills and I was the only one putting forth effort. I loved that man, and what we had, was really healthy and genuine. It's just really hard on me, and with my BPD and depression I'm trying not to let it take advantage of me.

Thank you so, so, fucking much for being empathetic."
depression,fkzo8ch,t1_fkzo0ka,1584675793.0,"We had a fight , and he lost feelings and didn't want to try.. After said so fight (first fight we've had), I put tremendous effort into fixing things and connecting with him onto a deeper level. Tonight he was honest and told me he's breaking up with me, because he lost feelings and doesn't see a point in us trying and him trying so yeah. It was really a lovely relationship and im shocked and hurt it had to end."

Like for example, I crochet, and I finally made my own etsy store to sell crochetted scarves, blankets, and crafts I make. I'm really just doing the best I can and truthfully I'm scared. Also, I do appreciate the comment and letting me know that I'm not alone. That was very kind of you! ❤"

relationship_advice,fk2ywid,t3_fg6th5,1583812641.0,"I recommend continuously working through those mental health issues with a professional and tread your relationship slowly with her, like you're walking on thin ice. Your feelings are valid, and you are upset and that's normal. Relationships aren't perfect and communication is key in them. Again, if this relationship is as important and meaningful as it is, confront her and talk about these things so you can have a balance, and also please see a therapist. I plan on setting up appointments for myself once I get my license, so I can work through my own bpd issues. Our SO's aren't our therapists and what we do or what we say can be hurtful sometimes and even draining. 
Best of luck to you and lots of love !"
AskWomen,fk2yd0m,t3_fg4fwt,1583812225.0,"I had to be at my lowest point, where all I saw was nothing and no hope, to cut who what I needed to. I blindly made excuses for an abusive piece of work, and after he traumatized me and quite frankly had sex with myself while he had me on laced ecstasy I decided shortly after to leave him. I deserved better, and i needed to heal and love myself. (I especially had to overcome That issue and I needed to heal) That man is living his own life on social media and living in his own negative self parade, despite what he did to me. He was the second man I truly fell in love with and trusted. And thankfully it was an ldr and I never visited him again. It's never easy to walk away or just cut someone out, and sometimes it takes you to be in that position where it consumes you and you have to escape it for your own sake."
BPD,fk2gmen,t3_fcrfpo,1583800615.0,"Exactly!! Relatives and people who were close in my life completely invalidated me and gaslit me, and were more concerned with being right than looking for a healthy solution. I had to learn to let go of those relationships and pursue healthier ones, and it's hard because I struggle with abandonment and losing people close to me. I know you're venting and I know some people don't like it when other people comment on vents and I respect that. I want you to know that I really admire you for opening up that perspective, and it's really nice to know that I'm not alone with conflicting or toxic relationships. It'll get better, I promise. We have to cut those bad weeds to nurture and take care of our garden. 
I give you my condolences and my own sympathy, because i relate. But I also believe in your own strength, transparency, and your courage with being vulnerble and sharing this. 
Lots of love."

AskWomen,fjysti5,t3_ffecn5,1583703836.0,"Very personal, but I was struggling today and I was trying not to relapse. I turned off all of my lights, and turned on the water to a warm/hot setting. I sat down on my shower floor letting the water consume me and I basked in all of that warmth. I threw the blade away, and I just sat there holding myself and crying. After around 20 minutes I got up and washed myself and turned back on the light. I then cleaned up and got ready for work. I really recommend this as a self care or therapeutic thing to do when you're struggling. I can confidently say I'm still over 4 months clean."
