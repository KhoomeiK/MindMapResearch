AskEconomics,fp2ch8w,t3_gav69n,1588259337.0,"I'm going to give a completely non economical and instead anecdotal answer to this, so feel free to skip over this if you want a more economical standpoint.

I have gone through a state school, and a very good friend of mine went through private school (which led us to having a conversion about this). The standard of teaching at my state school is pretty poor, and the standard of teaching at his private school was pretty high from hearing him talk about it. However, the standard of teaching amongst state school varies a lot amongst themselves, and same at a private school. Though I imagine the median of standard of teaching is a lot lower in state schools than private schools. However, a few things which he gained from going to a private school compared to my state school is connections and ambition.  A lot of his friends' parents worked in different areas of finance and he could ask his friends' parents to help him get a foot in the door. Most of my friends' parents work in manual labor jobs or lower skilled jobs. Now my friend is not rich, he was accepted to private school on a scholarship and wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise. However he got so much more access than I did to the financial world. Another thing is ambition, some of my friends from my school are ambitious but others are happy to settle for shit jobs. And we have no role models to look at to see what we can achieve, no one we can really call for guidance when progressing through prestigious careers whereas he has plenty of people there.

Private schools aren't a guarantee of success, but there are plenty of advantages they give which you just don't get from state schools. The lack of these advantages can induce inequality in my opinion"
