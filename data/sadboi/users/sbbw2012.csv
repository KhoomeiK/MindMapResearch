I would say don't reach out because if he doesn't give you the reaction you want, it'll mess you up."

BipolarReddit,epbvs8v,t3_bufr1s,1559147437.0,I'm in this boat right now. Took a payroll job with some really great opportunities but the work load was just too much stress. I quit taking care of myself. So I just recently put in my notice and am looking elsewhere. I feel like a huge failure and my mom is pretty concerned about my finances but I just couldn't stick with it. It was killing me. I'm going to be hitting the job hunting hard. I'm 27 with a 6 year old. I'm frigging terrified.

bipolar,eo9854v,t3_br0ffm,1558384720.0,A call center would give me anxiety too. I'm sorry you're in the same boat. This job gave me a lot more payroll experience as far a volume is concerned so I'm hoping that'll get some company's attention. I just really want to find something that I like and can grow in. I hope you love your new job and gives you less anxiety. Good luck to you as well! <333 We got this.
