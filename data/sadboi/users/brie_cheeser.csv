Please, please reach out to a support system and get your worries and frustrations off your shoulders. You need to talk to someone just to let out all the rants. It’s been dragging me down being cooped up and answering nothing but complaints all day long. At least when I’m at work, I have co workers I can complain to for a moment and they get it. 

It’s a lot for anyone to handle. 

Go outside, take a walk around the block. Tell your supervisor you need 10 minutes to go outside even if it’s outside of your scheduled breaks. Express what you’re going through because odds are other people in your department are feeling the same way. 

I understand the having a job guilt while others don’t have one as well. You don’t need to feel bad for not feeling grateful all the time. Your feelings are absolutely normal. 

Right now, it’s either you have a job or jobs are busier and more stressful than ever. You’re not alone and I hope you get a chance to talk to someone whether it’s a professional or a trusted friend or family member just to get things off your chest."

My sister tried to help me when I was 15 and that was not helpful, it made me more nervous. My hands were shaking because I was scared I’d hurt myself. 

Go for the plastic tampons that have a grip on them! I still can’t do cardboard or anything earth friendly. Don’t be afraid to look up tutorials or find images that show step by step. 

Also, don’t worry if you have to get a new one when the first try doesn’t go well! It took me three tampons do figure it out.

dating_advice,ezhaa1a,t3_d0w4kk,1567907680.0,"I have been on both ends of this situation. I was texting this guy and snap chatting, but I had just gone on a few dates with my now boyfriend and I knew I was no longer interested so I straight up told him I was met someone and didn't want to lead him on anymore. 

Another time it happened to me when I was actually excited to be talking to this guy who seemed really genuine and kind. I thought our flirting was going well, but he let me know that while he thought I was nice and attractive, he actually wasn't super comfortable with the dating apps and wasn't honestly weird about dating in general. It stung at first, but I was actually more grateful I didn't have to sit by my phone waiting for the next reply.

Kudos to you OP, that was super mature of you! I'm in a happy relationship now, but when I was on the dating apps, I wish more people were straight up with me. It sucks for a moment, but goes away fairly quickly!"
Anxiety,exgitpq,t1_exgej3i,1566265178.0,"We have a number of PTO days and we can use them however we see fit. However, because my position deals with live customers, you have to at least call off that working day for the next working day. 

If you call off the morning of, before they are able to schedule work flow for the day, you get a mark and there's only so many times you can call off the day of before you are terminated within that year. 

So, they will ask for the reason you are calling off, but I am very discrete and let them know I am not well for the day. If they do ask me further questions, I know that my bosses would not be bothered if I said I needed a mental health day. I work for a rather large company tbh too."

Anxiety,exg2iy1,t1_exfvnbm,1566253996.0,"It's seriously the worst!! I totally understand. I fear death so much. I especially do this when I eat food and get worried that I will suddenly become allergic to something and die. 

It's not a fun way to live, but I am working every day to find coping strategies and enjoy this life I have that I am grateful for. <3

Thank you for your comment!"
Anxiety,exg2bdz,t1_exfss5d,1566253855.0,"Thanks! I am seeing that every time I find myself needing to take one. They also help me reflect on why I need them or what pushes me towards them. I feel nervous, but better!"

Anxiety,exg22ui,t1_exfp61m,1566253695.0,You are a lovely person the internet. I think it was a bit of my subconscious trying to cope with stress and worry of reality with something out of reality. Thank you for your comment (:
Anxiety,exg1yv1,t1_exfkuza,1566253621.0,"Thank you! I hope work at home was productive and rejuvenating! I admit, I'm a bit envious I cannot take work home. Although I know there are positives and negatives to that depending the situation. Anyways yes, thank you, I'm happy to relate to someone. <3"
Anxiety,exg1q2u,t1_exfiubw,1566253462.0,"My work has a call off line specifically that is automated. It tells me to state my name, the date I'm calling off and why. That why is really scary, but all I said was ""I will not be at work today. I am not feeling well, but I will be back tomorrow, thank you."" 

I feel like it does not need to be complicated. Your health does not need to be projected to others. I mean, it's hard not to show that you have a broken leg or are coughing uncontrollably and I know that makes it easier to call off because it appears obvious to others. However, people are very complex and not feeling well could many so many things that you do not have to disclose. I remind myself that today, I am not going to be able to do my job to the best of my ability and I want to ensure that my efforts are at it's best for that day. If I cannot do this ( I understand that not everybody has this fortunate option) then I know I need to put my self first so I can help others more tomorrow. 

I will be making some tea before bed! <3 Thank you for the lovely comment."

Anxiety,exg0wbi,t1_exfeq59,1566252907.0,Gotta think about you when you need to! Good to know you had a co-worker to help out and you had the strength to leave something that was not helping you mentally.  I hope to find a career I am able to look forward to when I wake up in the morning (:
