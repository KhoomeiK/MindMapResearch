uberdrivers,fr2umew,t1_fr2hdzx,1589844207.0,When I go to certify it’s only shows 105 for each week .  Then when I check payment history it shows the 600 added for each week . I was unsure as well and did not want to waste a certify if It Didn’t show the 600. I’ve been on it for 4 weeks and received 600 plus each time . They’ve sent me the debit card and the cash was in there . I’m currently waiting for it to transfer to my other account .
uberdrivers,fr1hstt,t3_gm3p1n,1589819967.0,"I’m here in Cali 

Also approved for PUA I only receive 105 and I only did Doordash part time if that . 

When you certify your weeks and check payment history or something of that sort it will show the 600 on top of that for me it’s around 700. 

This might help With your question :

unemployment you get a certain amount in total . It’s about 2300 for me. So thats 105 each week from unemployment  until they’ve sent me 2300 in total . 

For each week the 600 is then added from the feds .

If they counted the 600 from the feds with my unemployment I’d only get like 4 payments . Does the make sense ?

So instead of deducting 705 each week until I hit 2300 they give me 105 each week and the  600 is added and not counted therefore prolonging my unemployment and maximizing the money . The 600 is assistances from the feds not unemployment"

depression,fmldmy8,t3_fvw990,1586184295.0,20M) I shave my head literally every two months because I feel like this but every time after the next few days i regret . I have beautiful curly hair and I bet you have beautiful hair too. I’m doing good so far by wearing a hat! Maybe try a beanie !! Or bleach your hair! Then you can even dye it any color ..

SuicideWatch,fmkhxq7,t3_fvtr3v,1586155544.0,"Finally brushed my teeth 
Finally washed my clothes 
Finally meditated 
Finally said I’ll stop acting like this . 
Finally said I don’t care what you want me to do 
Finally just did it . 
Finally 
You’ve got this guys . 
So before you talk down on yourself do those things that you ignore everyday. Those are the checkpoints in your life . 
After each completion there are mire unlocks .
Right now I’m goona meditate and listen to the rain outside my window because I can and it’s not weird for me to enjoy solitude .
Dont be sorry for who you are"

depression,fmkh4kq,t3_fvp2a1,1586154768.0,I try to think as loneliness as part of human evolution . ( just my fun interesting way to think of it) Since the beginning of time we’ve always wanted to be with others . Not many will experience true loneliness . It’s literally the unknown . See what you can explore with all this time on your hands . There’s things waiting for you . I’m here alone too but I’m glad I get to sail a different way . Somewhere undiscovered
depression,fmkgwgv,t1_fmkgvox,1586154552.0,You’ve got this .
depression,fmkgvox,t3_fvsgpu,1586154531.0,What’s stopping you from that peace now? Lay down relax . The phone your on is nothing you’ll find calmness in the present . It take a couple breathes but it’s waiting for you
depression,fmkgs9v,t3_fvsgpu,1586154437.0,"Not all those who wander are lost . 

I literally have no one in my life but I created it that way and I feel much better but it’s just so natural to be loney and get in your own head . I find beauty in seeing from my “lonely perspective” I’ve got all the time in the world . Every other hour I think why keep going but then I do have no interference and can do as I please tied to nothing"

UberEATS,fmkfpi7,t3_fvt175,1586153402.0,"I don’t understand the ending BUT I think you did more than enough to get ahold of the customer .

Next time if the customer says their goona pick up their own order which is extremely weird just say ok and let the customer pick up their food

You can still finish the order by saying you picked it up and then driving to the location and and then finishing the order . The customer got their food right? And you still get paid ."
depression,fmkf6qq,t3_fvs1au,1586152918.0,Haha do you ever get in moods where you could care less about the future because your life sucks now . Sorta me rn
doordash_drivers,fmk3i7s,t3_fvrar1,1586143655.0,I didn’t even leave my car I went to the timer for the first time and at about 3 minutes he came out . I got no problem going to your apartment complex and dropping off your food just give me instructions on what side or something at least . First ever double order not a good one .
SuicideWatch,fmhbkeq,t3_fv9t7w,1586073542.0,Well that does seem dumb when you put it that way . Sorry I’m just trying to help . Though he is reaching out to you. I say be open and if you see him not trying then don’t let him back in your life .
SuicideWatch,fmhb9te,t1_fmhb554,1586073222.0,Hm I would try and open up to him about how you’re feeling about life . Most people who use drugs are just trying to escape . He’s prob feels the exact same way as you do about life . That’s definitely a starting point . This could be the perfect timing for both of you
SuicideWatch,fmhb3ep,t1_fmhays2,1586073028.0,Build a relationship with your father ? I’m sure he loves you and wants to do the same . My dad has a hard to building a relationship with me and my siblings if only he knew how open we are to letting him in .
SuicideWatch,fmha9bd,t3_fv9t7w,1586072146.0,I sometimes feel the same . You’re not alone . 💜 how’s family ? I try my best to keep a relationship with them . Sort for this font idk what happened to change it lol

depression,fmfede0,t3_fuxf3y,1586025485.0,"I’ve faced this before . It’s ok to feel humiliated it’s ok to feel sad . It’s good that you cried and processed your emotions .

You can slowly understand that it’s just not meant to be and that there will be another if not many girls in your life that will catch your eye the same way she did . 

I’m fighting something similar right now but I’m turning it to improve myself until the time comes . 

Work on yourself 
Find things that build your confidence 
Do those things you chose to ignore everyday .
Begin that relationship with yourself . You can do it all starts with a little action my bro

Edit : I know it stings just thinking about it everyday but you’ve got to accept it and let it go . Don’t worry a crush is just a crush and there’s no reason to like her anymore if she doesn’t feel the same . But there will be someone in your life if not yourself who will make your day bright without forcing the issue . It will most likely fall into your hands once you focus on yourself"

doordash_drivers,fm8cupz,t1_fm8cj4v,1585847073.0,Exactly !? Guarantee that’s against policy in some way for wing stop . I even overheard them taking calls individually about how they were feeling . Hopefully it wasn’t because a coworker caught the virus . Sure hope it was just a checkup.
doordash_drivers,fm8cgkc,t1_fm8c99o,1585846863.0,Nice it seems like there’s always more tip if it’s at 7:50 - 8.50 but dang you don’t always expect it to be that big . Nicee
