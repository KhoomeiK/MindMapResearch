No need to put down a whole gender as being weaker than you when you dont even work out. How can you get mad at someone for reaching a personal goal ? Youre supposed to celebrate eachothers victories.

My God mother died a year or two after I stopped seeing my dad and I would start to see her in my dreams.

relationships,fpokcu3,t3_gejwtn,1588785957.0,"This is a great idea, coparenting should never be hard and I think this is a nice friendly gesture that says you are still a family, even broken apart. I think in the future it would also mean alot and benefit your daughter to see that you guys can coexist in the same place without ripping eachothers heads off. IMO as long as it remains civil and becomes somewhat friendly, you should make it a tradition to get a small gift for  her every mothers day (obviously including your daughters opinion as she gets older)."

LifeProTips,fnj416z,t3_g1xfu6,1586991549.0,"Ive worked in some form of customer service my whole adult life, so based on my experiences I would say, ehh, not 100% accurate. Right now,  I work at a dealership and you can be nice the whole way but its who you deal with that determines whether or not you get helped properly. I will help you out as much as I can on my end but when it comes to refunds or discounts, nice people get told there is nothing we can do especially if we have signed proof of authorization for repairs, while the shit heads who are rude and throw tantrums get free shit handed to them and services comped all the time regardless of the proof of authorization. However, in other cases my boss will also pick and choose who doesnt get anything based on whether or not the customer is rude to an employee he favors."
AmItheAsshole,fnir86p,t3_g1u1ij,1586984944.0,"NTA. This is definitely a hard situation to be in and you shouldnt have to find other ways to deal with such a sexist tradition but if I were you, I would eat something before going that way you arent starving by the time the food is ready. This is a terrible situation to be put in and im sorry for you and the rest of the woman in that family but its what you married into so if you love your husband and believe he is the man for you then you might have to find ways to deal with this issue without affecting their traditions, especially if it is just a couple times a year. With inlaws you have to choose your battles.

 If you and your husband eat at the same time at home then I dont agree that hes 100% THE asshole but he is AN asshole and 100% wrong for not sticking up for you when people are literally going out of their way to insult you. You married him not his family, so, you dont have to get along with everyone and you'll never be able please every one. They can feel how they want but that doesnt excuse their behavior towards you questioning their stupid ass tradition. Your FIL and anyone who came at you in a negative way are 100% the assholes."

Sometimes if someone thinks they have to pay for something else they'll choose not to by not going or not doing. If there was ice cream at home you could have just had that, instead of complaining and annoying him till he backs down. Thats a form of manipulation, and grabbing the wheel without apologizing afterwards or trying to step in when he was being yelled at is childish as hell and you need to figure that whole shit out before trying to reconcile, or even just take this L and learn your lesson. Youre not a bad person you just let your emotions get the better of you and thats something you need to work on, relationship or not."
