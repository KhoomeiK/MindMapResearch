Perhaps if enough people become aware of their disenfranchisement at the hands of automation, and can resist the inevitable populist rich-puppeteering influence that will convince the masses that UBI is destructive for our economy.

I could never bring myself to work, there was always an excuse, I'd leave it to the last minute while the psychological stress continued to build. Nearing the most advanced stage of this problem the additional pressure would make me less likely to complete my work. Coursework at university (before dropping out) was more doable as you could work at your own rate, but the pressure of exams (and needing to represent your knowledge in 2 hours) caused me to not even open a book until the night before (and of course I avoided my lectures/seminars - avoidance is a theme).

The best I could encapsulate the cause was as a 'fear of quantification', as if performing poorly would do such damage to my state of mind that it was better to opt-out, rather than half-ass something that I was never willing to put my all into. I suppose that's reflected in my NEETness too.

I think part of the issue was a profound lack of confidence in my own ability, I wouldn't want to invest so much time, effort and mental energy if it was only going to damage my self-esteem further through a poor result.

Growing up, I could never work for myself - I had to be practically forced to do things usually motivated by the fear of authority figures (parents, teachers etc). As soon as I was at university and didn't have that external impetus,  I'd simply not do the task. There's definitely a lot wrong with me these days that explains some of my prior oddities though.

You could say they're still reliant on their boss to get paid, but they're more likely to have a useful skillset transferrable to other means of sustainability. Wagies are necessary for the economy and for us Westerners to live as comfortably as we live (a quality of life which will only keep diminishing). That said, I don't really subscribe to this meritocratic capitalistic worldview where we must classify everything by its contributions or how much money you have, it really just encapsulates America where kids grow up calling other kids poor as an insult. Jobs are necessary to be fulfilled by someone (or something) but unfortunately our political/economic systems are sick and will ultimately lead to increasingly shit lives for those of us at the bottom even irrespective of your contributive value. 

Superior NEETs couldn't be NEETs if they didn't have their wagie family or the government (funded by wagies) to rely on. Though being a NEET is better in other ways - freedom, health (sometimes) and quality of life. If you could guarantee your future livelihood, being a NEET would be like early retirement but in the prime of your life - a period where you're more capable of utilising the freedom.

I'm not currently taking anything else (other than some prebiotic powder sometimes), though I'm vaping a lot of nicotine throughout my day which is definitely making me incapable of good sleep, albeit it seems to make me more interested in my activity a bit and more awake/less needing of sleep. Equally I recognise it's probably putting me more into the realm of hypomania, closer to the edge, though I've kind of lost my perspective on what my normal baseline is. I always feel very disconnected from my actions. I'm okay communicating using text but as soon as I'm in person/on the phone accessing my thoughts and translating those into intelligible driven conversation is impossible, the simplest and only way I could describe it is I don't know what I'm saying/thinking. If you'd ask me to reexplain my point I wouldn't be able to rebuild words around the abstract concept I have in my mind, because there is no abstract concept.

I did get some lion's mane but I thought that was making me a bit manic too (I judge this to mean unable to sleep with the addition of ringing in my ears) - all stimulants induce this effect in me even when taken very early in the day.

I used to play a game which had quite a prominent smallish community (3-10k players), which exacerbated your ego as you didn't have that sense of anonymity that bigger games provide, so much time was spent to earn the respect of others on the internet. It's the only time I felt valued growing up. I've retained this mindset even today with my game playing, in fact I don't even play much because of the immense weight of responsibility I feel to play well.

Loneliness is probably a factor or a cause of my nihilism, maybe more of a manifestation since I don't feel in want of other people - being estranged from myself is the biggest loneliness, and from that comes the defence mechanism (as Sijima said) of nihilism. It's getting to mission critical. Having unique pursuits is what make humans feel valued, I have neither productive pursuits or unproductive ones that I can commit to happily.

I've always been one to shy away from the ultra-competitive side of things due to the exponetial increase in psychological responsibility, but I still take the games really seriously and they always have an element of competition (else I figure what's the point of playing). Trouble is, now that I've stopped playing games, I don't feel good at anything, my ego is no longer being gratitified and I feel more disconnected from the world even than usual.

I remember as soon as I'd done it i felt like half my brain suddenly stopped working. Still feel like that tbh but maybe it's from some drug-induced psychosis, either way I'm still schizotypal. Not sure what causes what."

schizophrenia,fclet3z,t3_ehnyyc,1577746138.0,"I remember a year or two ago on this sub - you were a prolific poster and many of your posts were exceptionally eloquent and insightful. It's really sad that it's gone this way for you. Alas I too feel my story (and many others here) echoes how you've ended up. Slowly but surely I've watched my intelligence and language prowess diminish to the point of being below-average and disabled (I can even track it with my old reddit posts). I also can't read anymore, my mind's like a sieve, there's no point when I can't remember the last damn sentence. Life's not enjoyable in this dysfunctional state where I'm painfully bad at everything. I didn't even have schizophrenia (rather schizotypal), just far too many brief entrances into psychosis 3-5 years ago as a result of stress, anxiety and self-destructive drug use (guess I succeeded in the destruction) which really messed me up. I've not been on heavy doses of antipsychotic, but I can say that the cognitive deficits are not wholly to do with the medications, in my limited experience they more impact motivation and drive, since I suffer with the cognitive troubles despite being more or less unmedicated. Perhaps you could try reducing the dosage of your meds to see if it helps you though, from there you could extrapolate the value in reducing them further.

These cognitive deficits have been stable for me unfortunately, I've barely regained any function, it just feels like I get worse. I can't even enjoy my unlimited downtime properly because of anticipatory anhedonia (trouble with initiating activities). I think there's a degree of adaptability in regards to regaining function but it's more just your brain making better use of what's left. The blank mind is prevalent too, I don't have complex thoughts anymore, can't conceptualise things, recently I've started getting letters mixed up when typing like I have dyslexia or something. I dropped out of university because of the cognitive issues, didn't even finish my degree. Every psychosis messed me up a bit more.

I can't even pronounce certain words properly anymore, my tongue just recoils, thoughts are snatched away, I can't hold points in my mind, my eye's lose focus easier, my inner monologue is quiet/non-existent, my voice is quiet, it's like I'm watching myself talk and do things but really I'm elsewhere, sentence formulation (typically based around an abstract conceptualisation you'd use to inform your words) is non-existent, fatigued, restless, higher quiet voice, slow. Tired of this"
NEET,fcl2ng4,t1_fcl1sn5,1577738478.0,"According to the other guy who commented that's the norm though, even for non-consultants. I also go to therapy, I don't think you can cure my problems with therapy, you're right, it's only little emotional crumbs that make you associate therapy with relief. The therapy I also consider to be worthless though, at least medication can offer a more tangible effect for the more serious issues (saying that I'm unmedicated atm). I don't want to continue therapy but I'm a little hooked on it, and find it tough to say that I want to stop sessions (especially since there's a mandatory ""4 week winding down period"" to keep you seeing her under the sunk cost effect).

Process therapy can be achieved by having a good chat with a close friend (not that my estranged friends could be arsed to listen to that), I don't need a 65GBP per hour expert for a glorified chat about my troubles though. If you have mild phobias about open spaces maybe therapy can help, but only medication can help mask damage to your prefrontal cortex and make life more palatable (just not the meds they prescribe)."
NEET,fckzan2,t1_fckyknx,1577736407.0,"Shit's sort of fucked in terms of public mental health services from the UK. It's awfully convenient to not invest in mental health from the government's perspective, since that would give rise to a hell of a lot more disability claims. If you're poor with mental health issues you basically have no means of acquiring governmental assistance, and those who're rich are less likely to claim at all. Still, at least we have a public health service (for the time being)..."
NEET,fckxryy,t1_fckwor2,1577735473.0,"This is a consultant psychiatrist though (it's probably much cheaper to get a normal one), which sounded great in theory but I reckon he's grown complacent in his experience + age. He's not a very good enquirer and I'm not a very open person, so it's partially my own fault but the sessions become quite stagnant. Also, I perhaps squandered some of my sessions with my ADHD symptoms in order to get stimulants, but they're probably not right for me given that I suffer from mild schizo-ness and aren't conducive to stability.  Then we went down this whole route of me accidentally convincing him I had C-PTSD so now I just feel back at square one in regards to getting a proper diagnosis.

It used to be 160GBP but with the Brexit tax he upped it to 180.  I'd expect a normal one to be like 80-100."

schizophrenia,fcjsthe,t3_ehf44p,1577702922.0,"Like my brain has lost its guide: I can't generate sentences anymore, it's like in my mind I see the initial start of many different sentences, get confused as to which I should choose, end up picking the easier start but aren't sure where to go after that and I have no understanding past that initial snippet of sentence. Poverty of thought, poverty of speech.

I too used to be highly functional, now I just want to off myself or hide from the world, it's absolutely fucked. Deleted thoughts - can't hold things in my mind. It also feels like my inner monologue died, i think like an ape (emotions to certain prospects) rather than in intelligible english. 

Maybe I'm just describing negatives, i always believed thought disorder was a positive symptom.

I really don't see anyway of being what i once was, maybe you can improve things if you do a lot of reading but it feels like any improvements would be minuscule. i'm fully grown, my brain has stopped developing.

Feel free to ask anything else, i share your pain, society has no use for us, i wish i was born retarded rather than suffer the extreme loss of functioning/intellect/eloquence."

schizophrenia,fchl7j9,t1_fch3hnb,1577651517.0,"However you term it there are some differences between depression and the negative symptoms a schizophrenic* experiences, but you're right i'm sure the general depression advice is helpful for both. Self-pity is about the only thing I have left, it's comforting in a way. Thanks for your advice, when you're in that dejected state of mind good advice just bounces off of me, that's not to say i indulge destructive pursuits, but going for that walk when you're feeling zonked is easier said than done, even if it is the thing you should do. My response to adversity is giving up, complacency or avoidance, i'm not one of those who will overcome extreme personal challenges demonstrating great feats of willpower to hike mount Everest without legs, after all, that willpower is dictated by having an untouched willpower centre, perhaps that's quite defeatist of me and we're not all victims/successes of our circumstances"

Audiobooks are about the only productive solace I have left (it's slightly easier to follow and motivate myself too) but I only listen at night to lull me to sleep. I have all these different audiobooks downloaded that sound good, but I just can't bring myself to start them. Reading is too difficult so it dissuades me."
schizophrenia,fchhpdm,t1_fch2rk7,1577650588.0,"Unfortunately I feel much the same off pills, I'm not full blown sz (schizotypal which shares the negatives of schizophrenia). Generally the few positives I have manifest as fear/wariness/paranoia of others/ideas of reference, and disorganised state of mind. The APs make me feel less fearful/impending doom feeling, slightly less disorganised, but it just makes the discontent restless anhedonia more apparent, things are even less meaningful, the pills also help me sleep due to tempering that dopamine. My point is i think for me it's mainly part of the disorder, with a partial influence from the pills due to the mild lethargy they induce, I think if i was on a histamine-blocker AP it'd be awful though."
