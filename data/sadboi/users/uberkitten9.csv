CC mislabelled and didn‚Äôt bother to send off her painting, and also didn‚Äôt send the tee yet. She was still a very huge calloway stan and at one point, she litrally said in CC‚Äôs defence, and I quote - ‚Äòshe‚Äôs 27, living out of an apartment in New York, how much can she actually do?‚Äô ...    
    
At this point, as I was losing all the minuscule hope I have in humanity, I dozed off. Then, I woke up to [this](https://youtu.be/vQeSminXAr4)  video playing after that video ended, and it was surprisingly so reassuring. This woman touches on basically everything about CC and what is wrong with the scamming influencer culture, calls her out and gives enlightening advice to youngsters/fans about how to donate their money to rightful causes and deserving artists. It was sort of funny because it felt like she embodied this entire thread in video form.

It was harsh but I‚Äôve slowly built it up to daily use. I say just go for it. I don‚Äôt think alternating it with a lower strength will stop the purge or flakiness, you have to deal with it anyhow.

tretinoin,evc8vkz,t1_evc6v0e,1564409443.0,"I think it totally depends on how your skin takes it. I personally feel 0.1% would be overkill, since I got amazing results with 0.05%.

Edit - also, some people need some additional help to target the PIH and PIE along with tret, (tret alone didn‚Äôt work for me, too) - like vitamin C, niacinamide (for PIH) or azelaic acid ( for PIE)."

You just cannot shape and control people‚Äôs perspective! And isn‚Äôt that the most fun aspect of making art? People will interpret it in their own ways. At least to me, it is the best part.

I loved a boy in my teens and a future with him wasn‚Äôt possible, so I do know what that magic of innocent love is like, so sad I couldn‚Äôt make it last. Too late to find another one. Now i‚Äôll just have to settle for someone and think logically and all that, without any magic. Breaks my heart when I think too much about it, so I don‚Äôt and sleep all day lol"
