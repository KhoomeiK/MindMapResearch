CC mislabelled and didn’t bother to send off her painting, and also didn’t send the tee yet. She was still a very huge calloway stan and at one point, she litrally said in CC’s defence, and I quote - ‘she’s 27, living out of an apartment in New York, how much can she actually do?’ ...    
    
At this point, as I was losing all the minuscule hope I have in humanity, I dozed off. Then, I woke up to [this](https://youtu.be/vQeSminXAr4)  video playing after that video ended, and it was surprisingly so reassuring. This woman touches on basically everything about CC and what is wrong with the scamming influencer culture, calls her out and gives enlightening advice to youngsters/fans about how to donate their money to rightful causes and deserving artists. It was sort of funny because it felt like she embodied this entire thread in video form. What I mostly liked about it is that it was on  a platform that CC’s fanbase is most likely to venture, as I feel like a majority of her actual young girl fans don’t really use reddit, to come across a reality check."

It was harsh but I’ve slowly built it up to daily use. I say just go for it. I don’t think alternating it with a lower strength will stop the purge or flakiness, you have to deal with it anyhow. Clogged pores really do take a lot of time to heal, but you just gotta power through it I guess!"
tretinoin,evc8vkz,t1_evc6v0e,1564409443.0,"I think it totally depends on how your skin takes it. I personally feel 0.1% would be overkill, since I got amazing results with 0.05%. If I were you, I would use 0.05% for a while (like how you used 0.025% for 6 months) and if I still didn’t see any significant results, then I would probably bump up to 0.1%. Good luck!"

I always wash my hands after applying tret, before continuing the rest of my routine because it just feels weird on my hands, and even then, I sometimes have slight peeling on my palms or fingers.

tretinoin,evc60o1,t3_cj8msu,1564407282.0,"I’ve read in several articles that usually 0.025% is best suited for anti-ageing, and if you’re trying to tackle problems like acne or PIH, 0.05% is what works best. So, I think 6 months is a pretty high time to wait and you should totally up your strength.    
Edit - also, some people need some additional help to target the PIH and PIE along with tret, (tret alone didn’t work for me, too) - like vitamin C, niacinamide (for PIH) or azelaic acid ( for PIE)."
tretinoin,evc5qil,t3_cjasnp,1564407059.0,"Peeling is normal but your skin shouldn’t feel raw.

My point is, she literally instructed how people should behave like at her workshops, and that’s when I was like wtf? And then I noticed she does that with EVERYTHING! You just cannot shape and control people’s perspective! And isn’t that the most fun aspect of making art? People will interpret it in their own ways. At least to me, it is the best part.

I resorted to this because I really want to get rid of some stubborn acne scars ASAP. You could give it a try - BUT I MUST SAY - I don’t plan on using this routine forever, just for a month until my scars are lightened to my liking. I will then drop the hydroquinone. Also, I slowly built up my tolerance, started with hydroquinone and then added tret twice a week, I still use it twice a week and the rest every night."

tretinoin,etmvb96,t1_etmu0w8,1562969475.0,"I second the hydroquinone suggestion. Tret basically only treats PIH by increasing the overall cell turnover, it helps to fade away the marks quicker than normal. PIH must be treated by more than one route, and hydroquinone, vitamin C and azelaic acid are the most well knows ones in treating it and also more than one gives that extra boost you need. Additionally, tret will provide   better penetration of these ingredients too."
