things I was expecting/was told to expect that didn't happen, however?:

-increased hunger

-gaining weight

-potentially more irritable

-losing my ability to sing (I just sound like an 80's new wave singer now, an upgrade if you ask me)

-lower growth (this is a relatively common T side effect that I missed out on somehow)

If she wants to learn things about sex, she more likely than not has plenty of resources that don't involve a 30y/o man getting her drunk (still underage) and having sex with her without her consent, seeing as drunk people cannot consent.

For an example, if she wants to learn about sex, she can visit people/places her school guidance counselor, the health teacher, her primary care, her therapist (if she has one), one of her local Planned Parenthoods, or her local LGBTQ+ resource center. They are, more likely than not, some of the best and most reliable resources to be able to learn about the safe practices of sex. There are more ways to teach a young person about sex than doing it, especially with someone like that. The 30M in question is definitely not a safe resource and definitely not a good example.

Advice,fbjvpev,t1_fbjerdq,1576940797.0,"If you'd like the view of someone a bit closer to your age, I'll be 21 in March.

I remember being 17 like it was yesterday. I thought I was the most mature person on the planet, I felt like I was old enough to get it.

I understand completely that 16-17 year olds get horny and fuck. That's fine, they're allowed to. I'd be a lying dirtbag if I said I wasn't also super horny at 16-17. US Consent laws typically say that people 18+ can't have sex with under 18, but 16 and 17 year olds can have sex all they want. The fact that he is so much older than her is what makes this creepy and wrong. 

With women getting pregnant at such young ages, that also runs the risk of a significant amount of pregnancy-related illnesses that only pop up if you're underage.

I see why you think everyone's treating 16-17y/o's like they're 11, with some of the wording, but those laws are in place to protect you all from being groomed. If 16 year olds are allowed to have sex with 30 year olds, some will push for it to be even lower, making an argument like ""oh, teens are mature enough to make decisions at 13. why can't the age be lowered?"" It's a long spiraling rabbit hole that would inevitably lead to pedophilia being legalized. 

As a newly 17y/o, you may be mature, but you still have a lot more maturing to do. The human brain doesn't finish developing until the age 25.
