lonely,fpy9hrr,t3_gg1kir,1588999053.0,Iâ€™m probably older than your parents but Iâ€™m open to talking to you about anything Iâ€™m not looking for a relationship beyond friends. I can be a friend without benefits just a normal friend if you want someone to talk to that will not judge you Iâ€™m here Iâ€™ve been through a lot and still breathing maybe Iâ€™ll be able to give you another prospective anyways hope you find whatever youâ€™re looking for message me if you want to talk
depression_help,fpy8r4c,t3_gg2r72,1588998541.0, Life is hard and never fair Iâ€™m here if you want to talk about anything Iâ€™m probably much older than you and donâ€™t want to meet you at this point but Iâ€™m open to talking to you

depression_help,fjeyyjz,t3_fd46fy,1583280829.0,Sorry I should have stated my xwife because we have been divorced for 17 years now
depression_help,ffbn6xh,t3_esilyr,1579773779.0,Unfortunately Iâ€™ve been there hang on it will eventually get better. Iâ€™m having a hard time as well but im still trying to hang on im hoping soon for you because you deserve to be happy
depression,ffbmov7,t3_eshxv2,1579773007.0,Well Iâ€™ve never been called a drama queen but also Iâ€™m a guy so thereâ€™s that but I find that most people donâ€™t really care how you feel as long as you still benefit them in one way or another unless they are truly your friend and sometimes even then.  Life happens and we need to try the best we can itâ€™s never easy and Iâ€™m still trying but itâ€™s really hard so please keep trying
depression,ffbjrlu,t3_esedcq,1579768606.0,Damn thatâ€™s just terrible youâ€™re not whatever that person said I unfortunately know first hand losing my father and a childhood friend from suicide plus also from my last 3 failed attempts hopefully youâ€™re in a bit of a better place. I know people already told you to report him/her hopefully there is a way for them to find that person from your block list
depression_help,ffbe3uc,t3_eshur2,1579761397.0,"Hi I really donâ€™t know how to start but Iâ€™m tired of trying and at this point of my life I donâ€™t see any point to keep going.  Donâ€™t even know where to start, my childhood, my failed marriage or even why I keep getting cheated on.  There must be something really wrong with me and I just want to maybe be happy with a real relationship with a partner whom can love me as much as I love them."
depression,ffbbtwh,t3_ejsoej,1579758900.0,In my opinion I believe that statement is true after my first attempt waking up in hospital 3days later only to find once out and trying to speak with people didnâ€™t really care unless they were directly impacted or could profit from it
