It sounds like maybe the next steps you should take should be therapy and perhaps dialing back on or quitting alcohol altogether, because it sounds like you're using that to self-medicate (and putting other people in danger in the process, for which there is absolutely no excuse).

You can do this, but you will need to decide to do it for yourself, and that you're worth doing it for. The good news about rock bottom is that there's nowhere to go but up."

It felt like by not having Corvo speak, the player got to decide how Corvo reacted to the events of the game. Sheer, blind rage pushing him to eviscerate everything between him and his goal? Or are his actions driven by sorrow and mourning, with every step carefully planned and outcomes calculated? What does Corvo think of Granny Rags, or the Outsider, or the loyalist group, for that matter? What about the individual members? Does he trust them? Is he excited by his new powers or scared of them? Does he feel stronger the more powerful he gets, or less in control?

I think Dishonored is great because all play styles are fun and without Corvo having dialogue to push the player into how to feel, he becomes a blank slate where you can feel like you're telling the story however you want."

It was a freeing realization, because looking into medications felt more justified; my brain just does not make or (based on what meds work best for me personally) can't make use of the right chemicals.

Speaking of fountains, I miss the one in the courtyard of the teacher's college building. In the Fall it was part of my 'minimum outside exposure' route to get to classes in the FAC.  I miss the fact that wherever you find a trash can (and they're everywhere), there's a recycling bin adjacent.

I miss Hayden library; I kinda hated going there, but I really appreciated the fact that we had a hidden underground library in the desert, like Avatar. I miss the people giving tours, walking backwards with white polos and khaki shorts. I oddly miss all the little spots around campus that were good to have a quick panic attack in.

depression,fmsa61n,t3_fx1mos,1586350873.0,"In my opinion, the world isn't made for extroverts, but they certainly tend to be the most vocal about the ways they enjoy it. I think that just like introverts tend to be quiet people, we also tend to have a more quiet enjoyment of things. The problem is that we see the things that extroverts enjoy and how much they enjoy it (because it's hard to avoid) and begin to internalize that as what we, as introverts, *should* enjoy. 

Naturally the problem there is that if that activity isn't a good fit for you, you will feel like something is wrong with you when all that happened is that you tried something you didn't enjoy. I had that response with trying the club scene. It's 1000% not for me, and that's okay. It's that 'don't judge a fish on their ability to climb a tree' thing. It's about finding things *you* enjoy, because you have your own specific combination of things that you do and don't like. It's exhausting to try new things, but there's really no way to know for sure what you'll actually enjoy until you try it. And you might find that even as an introvert you enjoy an 'extroverted' activity. 

Also, I feel like right now everyone's depression is up because of the global situation. If you think that's the case, try to own it and remember that it won't last forever."

projectmanagement,fmq14yi,t3_fwpx9j,1586290980.0,"Oh man, I've been remote for the last two years and my biggest tip is instead of saying ""let me know when you can see my screen"", give it a few moments and  then ask ""can anyone \*not\* see my screen?""; that way you're not waiting for one person to speak for the group, but rather letting the people who are behind catch up. 

If you are not saying, or about to say, or expected to respond to something, mute your damn microphone! Be aware of your background noise, even when you are talking, and if you have to pause for a moment to let a loud truck go by or something, so be it. 

Overtalking is going to happen, no way around it unfortunately; rudeness, latency, what have you. My advice is to always try to be the first person to cut yourself off and say ""I'm sorry X, you go ahead"". Some programs also let you virtually raise your hand, which can be useful. 

In terms of video, I've actually heard good things about using your camera as a sort of ""I would like to speak now"" indicator; have it turned off when you're just listening, but when you're reacting or ready to respond, turn it on. I've not practiced this (I don't often use a camera), but I know groups that swear by it.

This is in conflict with your and AZ DOT's statement that people will somehow decide to steer into any lights they see like a moth to a porch light. 

If you have time to see the lights and decide to aim for them, you have the time you need to determine whether the object is stationary or moving. If you cannot do that you are overdriving your visibility, and there's nothing anyone can do to help you because you're an idiot; lights, no lights, it doesn't matter if you're driving faster than you can react. 

You cannot control the choices other drivers make. All you can do is give them the most information possible, and making yourself into a hidden obstacle just makes it harder for people to see and avoid you."

Think about an interstate; with the barriers on either side you realistically cannot get farther off the road than the shoulder. Being harder to see on the shoulder of a highway is extremely dangerous with other drivers around; turning off your headlights and turning on your hazard lights lets other drivers be aware of your position, and treat you as a hazard. 

If it's a highway out in the sticks where you can pull completely off the road into the dirt I can understand how turning off your lights could prevent people from mistakenly believing that the place you are sitting is on the road. I think I would still turn on my hazards, but I can understand why people wouldn't in that situation."
