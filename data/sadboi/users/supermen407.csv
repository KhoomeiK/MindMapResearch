Accidentally landed in HR and it’s much better because the pay so far is okay, although I’m still early on in my career, and there’s a lot more jobs in the field. (Seriously I was checking the job openings for teachers in college and for the fields I wanted to work in there was actively 44 openings in the WHOLE state). 

Maybe when my country starts actually taking education seriously and cares about the people that do such an important job I’ll go back and get a masters to be a teacher. Until then I’ll be in HR. 

So I guess failed dreams haha."

It’s funny because I always feel there is this small part of that former amazing person left inside of me, struggling to come back. That sometimes gives me foolish hope that I will be what I once was some day.
