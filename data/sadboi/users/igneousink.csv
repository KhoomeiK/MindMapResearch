Perhaps shift into absurdism, that works sometimes.  Or focus on being a humanitarian.  There are other ways to find meaning, but none of it is going to the The Big Meaning or The Answer.  I'm not sure that those ever come.  

One could argue that the bible itself is Man's attempt to create meaning, understand ""the source"" and to direct the current historical narrative as it existed during that time.  Agendas were furthered through what was kept in, what was kept out, where the emphasis was placed.  

That being said, I do think there are profound truths to be found in the bible, along with the proven Historical Narrative.  It's fascinating to discover just how much ""truth"" there is in it, once you take out the dogma. 

 Me, personally?  I believe that the universe is vast so vast that if I think about it too long I have to lie down.  I just try to be a good person and recognize that ""I"" am not a god.  I do have moments where I do sense something ""other""?  but scientists have proven that if you put this patented magnet helmet thingie on the brain and fire it up the person wearing it will have a religious or spiritual experience that corresponds to his or her core beliefs.  It's called the god helmet.  So maybe when I have these moments that part of my brain is doing something.  

I've smoked considerably more pot than when I first responded so I have gone back and read John 12:25 again.  

Seems to be it is really about finding meaning that is not on the physical plane, a story told in other ways  - for example, Don Quixote, Atlas Shrugged, all the other great religious texts, whatever PoPCult is watching on Netflix . . . 

It would seem you and I both struggle a bit with that whole meaning thing.  

Well I haven't come this far to give up now so I'll keep tilting at windmills, even if they are mostly mental!  Have a beautiful day and if you need a nap you need a nap but don't make it 20 hours that will make your brain zappy and you will have possible sleep paralysis and nightmares.

This is my line of thought, not so much that the gov't puts us there as it is a natural expression of the failure of the system.  Everything in the damn united states is like a Dali painting - everything is on stilts, in danger of falling down.  

I hope that time will reveal more as I walk around feeling as though everything is so murky and dark.  

I live in NY in one of the hardest hit areas and, via first hand info from friends & family, things are really bad.  And if I were to get on board with your argument, maybe they are just really bad because our medical system isn't able to handle anything above and beyond basic care.

One could argue as well the numbers are deliberately diminished as the test is subjective and based on ""levels"", with different agencies and states deciding what ""level"" constitutes Covid.  

But you might be right, the numbers might be conflated - I don't claim to have any stake on the truth, I'm just trying to come to my own conclusions like everyone else.   I just know there's a lot of activity in my own county and the hospitals and morgues are struggling with the overflow.  As of yet, however, I don't believe the system has been totally overrun and that's due in part to the shut down (which I have mixed feelings about as I'm sure you do too).

My personal deep down belief is that there is something totally different going on, an agenda that we aren't aware of beyond the usual corruption & greed - There's been a lot of talk about the sun lately and its solar minimum; perhaps we are heading into a Day After Tomorrow scenario.  Maybe the aliens have finally come.  Maybe the chemtrails will turn us all into well behaved zombies that perform well for the motherland.   Perhaps it was just a test to see how we all do, like little puppets.  

The whole situation just stinks and I think we can both agree on that part of it.

I'm a huge nerd and back then (the 90's) that was uncool so I had a hard time finding guys that liked reading science fiction and listening to electronic music.

The hours just flew by (we were at a club on a base) and one thing led to another and we ended up in a hotel room off base. But we didn't sleep together we climbed into the giant jacuzzi and washed each other's hair and then built a fort. When he kissed me, finally, at like 3 in the morning, it was like the world exploded and my knees went weak. I could see how much he liked me in his eyes and I could feel it.

We finally said our good-byes for the evening and I was excited for what was to come.

But . . . I never talked to him again. He was married. With a kid. Didn't actually live in the barracks, lived off-base in a house with a playset in the backyard.

After days of not hearing anything (this was in the days of phones! there was nothing else other than mailing a letter or sending a telegraph) I finally went to one of his friends and after a long look at me with a weird expression, he told me.

I was so wrecked and I still kinda am! Like almost 30 yrs later! I remember thinking why would he do that? Why did he have to feel so nice? Was it not real? Was it real for him? Didn't he feel the same way? Couldn't I see it? Maybe I saw what I wanted to see? And so on. I really went down the rabbit hole and it was lined with razor blades all the way down. I was so deeply hurt but also mad because I was hurt and couldn't stop being hurt.

On a side note he sent me Valentines Day Cards through ""Loveland Colorado"" (so you can do it anonymously) for about three years after I got out of the Marines. I heard he had gotten divorced but at that time I had no interest anymore because I felt like he was a someone who did me dirty. It gladdened me tho, that he was thinking of me but in the end couldn't have me. Then I felt petty for feeling that way and I moved on. Now it's 20 years later and from time to time he still messages me on FB. lol? He's fat and bald. I'm still attractive haha.

I don't know what I'm saying I guess I'm trying to make you feel better. There will be others, I promise you. They may not be common, they might be hard to find but your ""others"" are out there. And I use the plural because the person who makes your heart melt today might not be the person who melts it tomorrow. As humans we are always changing and evolving (hopefully) whether we realize it or not.

I know I probably sound like your mom or cool aunt!! You know, the one that always gets drunk at family functions but gives the best gifts.

I hope you start to feel better soon. Sometimes these things can set us back for weeks. Mr. Married man messed me up for a good month at least and I dated A LOT back then and often.

This is gonna suck to hear but the only way you ""get over"" is by grabbing your mind like it's a child and saying ""hey i know you wanna go there but we can't go there"" and then you try to do something else. The key is to keep yourself from ruminating on it even though that's all you want to do. I also journalled a lot, that helped. The key is to listen to music while you do it.

Thetruthishere,fppod0x,t3_gekg75,1588806029.0,"I think you had an otherwordly encounter.  Beyond that . . . angel?  alien?  interdimensional being?  In your dreamish state you were able to look into the aether and see not only your own energy, but the being/thing looking at your energy.  

There is a similar encounter that happened in my life and coincidentally (or not?) it was during a time of intense trauma and chaos.   

Had a friend do a house blessing for me but didn't tell her about the entity.  She called me at work freaking out, mad because I didn't tell her about the entity.   

She thought it was a ""Tulpa"" or manifestation of my own energy.   That answer never sat quite right with me, though.  It felt very ""other"".  

I told my therapist about it and she called the psych to tell her to change my meds.  lol?  

There's a book called ""Hands of Light"" and in it the author talks about emotion as if it can be an actual physical thing.  It can have a color, location and shape.  That won't give you any insight into the being but maybe the lesson here isn't even the being - maybe it's that your sadness is so great that it has physicality and now it is up to you, as the carrier of this, to decide how you want to carry it, what you want that sadness to look like.  Maybe you need to give that slime a hug.  Heck, give the being a hug, too.  Nooooo don't do that maybe."

First of all, your Dropping In post has me SHOOK.   Second of all I don't know if you are married or not but I'm a neurotic mess and would freak out if my spouse was a diver even though it's probably less dangerous (provided you are properly trained/equipped) job than say, driving a bus!  

I have questions !!!!!  (always) - what type of work would you be doing in a water tower?  Have you ever been in one of those old castle-y looking water towers?  Do you have a favorite?  When you were in army boot camp were you good at the swim qual?  Did you know by then that this is what you wanted to do?  

I have more but I won't be a pest!!! Thanks!!!!"
