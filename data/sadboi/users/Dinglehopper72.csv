The cutscene of Abby killing Joel, and the later one of her beating Ellie and her girlfriend are genuinely gritty and upsetting. It's inevitable that there are people who are gonna hate it but I still think it would be best if people would just play it themselves and avoid spoilers before drawing such negative conclusions. The game looks intense and uncomfortable for the player, that could have been a good and impactful thing. However, from what I know now, I don't think the fact you play as Abby during an Abby vs. Ellie fight is a wise decision for the writers to make because it will not have the effect creators intended. I understand they will humanize Abby, but most fans of the game would still want Ellie to win and just lose on purpose over and over. That part just seems like something gamers would make a meme out of, to be completely honest."
