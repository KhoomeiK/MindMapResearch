NarcoticsAnonymous,fr0eadk,t3_gll1v8,1589792546.0,"NA helped you through your journey and it sounds like you helped others too. You are not obligated to be in NA for the rest of your life. I think of it like therapy. I have been in and out of therapy for a decade. When I feel my mental health slipping I find a therapist and work through it. After we have worked through all of my blockades, well then there’s not much for us to talk about and the sessions end up just being a catch up. The program is there to support you through your recovery and then after you should repay that by helping others. But you should not have something in your life if it’s no longer useful or brings you joy. Just don’t isolate too much. We introverts use that as a coping mechanism sometimes and it can turn unhealthy and dark quick.

Do what’s best for you. And if that’s taking a hiatus or permanent break from NA, then so be it. Sometimes people have to shed their past after they’ve worked through it.

Although I must say as an agnostic myself, the steps are fairly useful and are used in therapy just in different ways. Step 1 is get out of denial. Step 3 is the believe you can recover. Step 4 is to sort your baggage. Step 6 is to self reflect. Step 11 meditation has been linked in several studies of its many benefits. And step 12 is community service. Because a life of helping others gives meaning to your own. 

Anyways good luck. Keep a balanced life and you’ll be fine."

suboxone,fpugpx5,t1_fpu0wfs,1588912463.0,"You have a lot of generalizations in your reply.

 “One study was specifically conducted to determine if PAWS should be included in the DSM-IV. After a review of the existing literature at the time, Satel and colleagues at Yale University School of Medicine concluded that the diagnosis should not be included.

But, the Yale scientists came to that conclusion, not because the syndrome does not exist, but because of ""methodologic limitations of the studies and lack of consensus definition of the term itself.""

Studies that did consistently describe symptoms extending beyond acute withdrawal failed to conclusively demonstrate protracted withdrawal from alcohol and opiates because they did not:

Do multiple time-point sampling
Use standardize instruments
Use control groups
Re-administer the substance to suppress the symptoms
While methodological issues may have excluded PAWS from the DSM, there is research suggesting that the syndrome exists and can contribute to relapse.”

There’s just lack of studies. It’s depends on the drug your detoxing off of, there are PAWS. I think your just focusing on only anxiety and depression but there many physical elements that could be nothing but PAWS. It takes time for your brain recalibrate, especially depending on how long the use was. There is a long list of PAWS symptoms from each different drug because their all different like insomnia or skin burning.

Personally I have felt PAWS and yes I even had it before I knew what it was. And now that I have a long laundry list of several different classes of drugs I’ve detoxed off, yes there most definitely is Post Acute Withdraw Syndrome."

gabapentin,fpc12d7,t3_gcdso1,1588484270.0,"Your body will adjust.

But I have to agree with the other poster.

Take this from an ex heroin and meth addict that’s also detoxed off benzos. Gaba withdrawals are hell and it can even happen at the low dose your on. I would just use it as PRN. As needed on really bad days.

Once you start taking the morning dose, after about a month, after about 5 hours after your morning dose, you will go through interdose withdrawals. You will be moody, achy, and all around feeling like shit until you take your evening dose. So then the next step would be implement a mid day dose. And then 300mg is no long effective so you go up and so on. Then you’ll start feeling the awful effects of gabapentin. Weight gain, anxiety (yes is will start giving you bad anxiety), some people start to develop numbness of limbs, cognitive issues, and the list goes on.

Then you’ll want to detox off it and your life will be turned upside down. This has been the worst withdrawals of my life. Get some real feedback from real patients from the gabapentin survivors group on Facebook. This drug is awful and it’s being prescribed way too much. I think it’s the third most prescribed drug there is. The studies they’ve done on it are pretty horrific. It’s stunts new growth of neuropathways, it effects breathing into patients and can cause sleep apnea, and I saw one research journal that said the damage from this drug can become permanent. And they been sued many times because of the suicide rates of those who were on it and those who were trying to come off. They now have a black box warning on their script because of it.

It’s a nasty drug and beside the knowledge that it effects the voltage gated calcium channels, they really don’t know what else it does.

Like I said, I would research it more (as doctors don’t know shit about any drugs anymore) and then make a decision based on that. My recommendation is to only take as needed.

And I know you didn’t want this long speech from a stranger. But I’m trying to save you from the hell I’m going through. I’m currently doing a very slow taper to get off this drug. And if you could spend ten minutes in my mind during this time, you would never touch this shit. I’m not an anomaly, check out that facebook group."

But what if the most powerful being in the universe stilled loved you? What if they believed you could not only get clean but also make a beautiful life for yourself?

You would find strength from this being because if he still believes in you and loves you then you should love and believe in yourself too.

nosurf,foizn1p,t3_g7opje,1587802636.0,"You discussed a lot of things your going to find in the real world too. You are the company you keep. And in the case of Reddit, you are the subs you sub to. I’m mostly on here for addiction help. I’m a poly addict so I’m on many quitting subs. In the beginning it was to ask for help, now that I’m further along it is to give advice and help any way I can. It is a positive experience for me. My other subs are parrots because I love birds and my own. Also mental health subs for the same reason of addiction. And then I’ve added a few nonsense ones to keep my feed diverse. Along with some freethinking discussions subs like awakening or agnosticism. 

I find what you say is true if you are the main subs like tifu, aita, unpopular opinion, roastme, pics, etc.

Stray from the populated subs, you find beauty in the small unique communities. 

However I’m on this sub. So I means I need to spend less time on reddit regardless.

Anyways good luck. I’ve done a 30 day phone detox where I did not even have my phone with me. It’s was amazing. The small things meant so much more. A breeze while outside reading, an intense movie you’ve never seen, and deep conversation with a friend. Balance is key. Phones and the internet are designed to be dopamine snatchers.

gabapentin,fo4kqhc,t3_g5hyjb,1587506194.0,"Seconded. I’ve been addicted to all opiates (heroin, Methadone, oxy, etc), I’ve been addicted to benzos (mainly Xanax), I’ve been addicted to stimulants (adderall and meth), I’ve been addicted to legal stuff like phenibut and kratom, and the list goes on.

Gabapentin has been the worst drug. It’s been the hardest to get off of (it’s like a mixture of a benzo and opiate detox) and also physically while on it, it has destroyed everything. I’ve lost so much hair because of it, my teeth have lost a lot of enamel because it steals your calcium and magnesium. Which also my magnesium has been low for the two years I’ve taken it and have to have monthly shots. It also made my cholesterol higher as well. Also given me acne and tremors.

And then the withdrawal makes me so suicidal. While I’m tapering, I feel as if I’m in a constant panic attack 24/7. My cortisol levels are through the roof and so are my adrenal glands. And my hormones are all kinds of fucked up.

And while gaba is super useful to detox off other drugs, nothing helps to detox off gaba. I have to take heroic doses of opiates or benzos to find relief while detoxing off it. 

And the insomnia and rls are the worst while detoxing too. I don’t know if I’ll ever be the same.

All the research papers that say while on gabapentin and lyrica, your brain can’t make new neuropathways. My cognitive abilities have been destroyed while on this drug. I used to love to write and had great vocabulary. Now I’m so scrambled.

I’m doing a really slow taper now and it’s working. At 900mg now. All I can hope is everything heals.

No other drug has been this destructive (and after only two years of use!). Even while meth was pretty bad mentally and physically, this drug tops it.

This is just my experience. A lot of you won’t have this issue and that’s great. But if you are also having a bad experience with gaba, there’s a Facebook group for gaba survivors and it’s great."
recovery,fo47bki,t1_fo3vhkj,1587499430.0,"Yeah I felt great on subs in the beginning too. But because the half life is so long, you build up in your system so you body never gets a break. Like when I was doing dope, I would do a dose and go to sleep and wake up sick. Sure I would do a dose immediately but my body had a small break from opiates. Subs mess up hormones more than any other opiate (besides Methadone) because of the long half life. And hormones can fuck up everything in your body like energy and motivation. I think you’ll notice when you taper down to 2mg you will prob have some more energy.

I could also be a combination of the two. When I got off meth, it took about a year for my natural energy to come back as well."

However there are some disturbing academic journals about gabapentin that is harmful to the body. Like not being able to create new neurons and so forth. I would do some more research before you make the decision to stay on it. Because now that I’ve been addicted to both. I would chose kratom over gaba anyday.

StopSpeeding,fmk1pyc,t3_fvockt,1586142452.0,"A lot of us were prescribed adderall with a legitimate diagnosis. I am one of them. Once you become addicted though, it is really hard to go back to moderation. You’ve opened panadoras box, there’s no closing it. You are going to have a rough time in the coming years, unless you come to terms that you’re going to have to quit at some point. I’ve actually never of heard of any person taking a stimulant as prescribed longer than 10yrs. Eventually they stop working anyways. Even taking the prescribed dose the entire time, taking amphetamines are still not great for the body. At the prescribed doses they still can cause heart complications and stress to the heart muscles, it changes your circadian rhythm, brittle hair and nails, acne, imbalanced hormones (causing physical and mental health issues like mood swings, agitation, etc). It can cause anxiety that can become permanent, psychosis/trauma, eating disorders, insomnia that last years, dry mouth that causes tooth decay, higher cholesterol, gallbladder pain (and need for removal), and can cause permanent brain damage. Along with more on the the list. 

I had to learn the hard way that moderation is just not possible and needed to learn new ways to effectively handle my ADHD without stimulant medication (non-stimulant medication and Wellbutrin being the exception). Perhaps you’re the exception and not the rule and will be able to learn the discipline to use moderately. All of us had to try for ourselves and learn the hard way that we couldn’t. 

The way you described handling the pills with your parents is a telling sign that it might get worse. As I did the same exactly thing with my father. He ended up buying a safe with a combo and key together and kept the key with him at all times. It didn’t matter once I found a friend selling. And hey maybe I’m projecting. It’s just my story and so many others seem to go this way.

But the good news is I now have 5 years off all stimulants and am very happy to be off them. I’ve learned some great coping mechanisms to help with my ADHD and put them in use everyday. It’s a hard but I’m happier this way. The meds made me crazy. Towards the end I hated the way they made me feel. It felt like taking poison. 

Good luck in your endeavor."

And with some drugs there is damage that cannot be salvaged like with benzos and amphetamines. Also there is some primal switch that happens with addiction that cannot be unswitched. I have five years clean off heroin and meth. But I cannot take opiates with any moderation like a normal person. I know this. Why? Because I’ve relapsed with many years of clean time before. I will always be an addict and it’s not negative. It’s a label. Labels are good to find communities. Just like I’m part of the LGBT group. I label my sexual orientation and an able to find a community based on that. I think you need to reflect why calling yourself an addict triggers you so much.
addiction,fl67id1,t1_fl5wki8,1584857087.0,I have 5 years off heroin. The smell of vinegar sends me right back as a trigger. Brains heal but never completely.

nosurf,fktdvq4,t3_fk8wqx,1584515513.0,"Great post. Glad it’s working out for you. I remember in rehab we weren’t allowed to have phones so for over 30 days I was phoneless. The first week I could feel I was actually detoxing from the phone (along with the drugs lol). It’s insane how much we depend on them. In rehab, it’s was so great focusing on people’s stories and discussions."

This is true. You will only be successful if you believe you will. So you’re right. Don’t quit until you believe you can. But I must tell you, life on the other side is great. It’s hard in the beginning but it’s worth it.

Why not do a REALLY slow taper. A water taper. Where you only take 10% off every month. It would be so slow that it’s gentle fall to sobriety."

And lots of parrots . budgies, ring necks, eclectus, conures, etc. and they all get along and are happy. I drive to national park to national park, wandering and exploring with my flock.

This time try a bunch of different healthy things that you could maybe channel this anxiety into. Journaling, drawling, cooking (if that’s doesn’t hit to close to home), yoga, meditation, crafts, etc."
gabagoodness,fkmpsew,t3_fjbnun,1584335751.0,"I wish I could find the study but when withdrawing off opiates (and kratom), our immunity lowers. So just take your time with the kratom taper. As for gabapentin, I haven’t seen anything. But gabapentin does deplete magnesium which is important, so I would take some daily. (Most Americans are deficient anyways). However the two interact so make sure not to take gabapentin and magnesium within two hours of each other. But I feel you with all this virus and detox stuff. Scary times."

It gets a lot easier, the cravings are so fleeting. But for now your being safer. Great harm reduction tool to use kratom if you get a cravings. Recovery isn’t always liner. It’s great for the straight edge people who never use again but there are other ways too. As long as your working to better yourself, then that’s all that matter. As the rooms say, “progress, not perfection”.

Kava,fkjnh0v,t1_fkj3lx3,1584251761.0,"So I just got my blood done recently and I had high levels of bile in my blood or something like that. It basically means the liver and kidneys aren’t functioning right. Well I got the blood done after a night of high kava dosing. I stopped drinking kava because that was the only reason I could think of. I had to get my blood done a month later to see if there was progress and it’s almost back to normal now.

I’m not saying it was 100%  the kava. We’ll never know. But to me it’s the only possibility. But I’ve always had a sensitive liver because of an illness I had when I was in my late teens.

I’ll make a post of this later with a screen shot of both tests."

gabapentin,fk9cqh5,t3_fh2yis,1583973397.0,The real fun starts day three. I wouldn’t discredit other people’s withdrawals because you didn’t have any. I used heavy dose of benzos for three months when I was 21. I jumped cold turkey and didn’t have any withdrawals. I did a month binge years later and it was an awful experience.
quittingphenibut,fk9amcl,t3_fh5pdc,1583972153.0,"Got on gabapentin in rehab two years ago when I went there to detox off subs. I was only on subs, nothing else. Oh easier times. These last two years have been a carousel of phenibut, kratom, baclofen to get off gabapentin. Now I’m only on gabapentin and will be doing a long taper for the next foreseeable future. If I had known in rehab the hell gabapentin would have caused, I would have said nope. But hindsight is 2020. 

Let’s just say after being on gabapentin 600mg three times a day for two years, after skipping doses for three days, I literally loose my mind.

No other drug has had its effect on me like this besides benzos. And I’ve come off everything.

Anyways if you can, save the gaba’s for really bad days."
