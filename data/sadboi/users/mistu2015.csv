lonely,exmo7uw,t3_ctn3d1,1566436395.0,"Children are so pure at heart. â™¥ they process emotions in such delocate way and see love as an unconditional emotion as it should be unlike as adults mess it up with complications.

You might have an apathetic face, the kid can recognise easily. Or he is just pure at heart sees beyond facial exoression to our heart."
relationship_advice,exdhq3k,t3_cs9wi0,1566176978.0,"In fact you can't, right away. 
What you can do is give it time, act normal &  regular and never put yourself in situations where there is a slightest chance of incident like this can reoccur. Within time it will be okay. Pressing the wound way too hard to heal can cause new bleeding so be your regular self and keep the love flow through. And even when you will have guys fight over other silly things he might bring back that issue don't get mad comply with the situation and tell him afterward you already repented over the mistake so let it go. Best of luck."
depression,excwjrk,t1_excg0ea,1566161361.0,"Glad you didn't and carried on from that day! Remember, things can be broken and still beautiful. When you find no peace, joy in yourself, be a giver. Think everything you have achieved, you managed to carry on, make a home for your family. It's a joy keeping the life going forward. Normal for regular people, even they have struggles and people like us who have this extra buggage on the back of life, we try twice as regular person does. We are  conqueror of life. <3"
