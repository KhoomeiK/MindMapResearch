Took me to hospital and get the help I needed. It is impossible to lead yourself through a tunnel you cannot see the end of when there are seemingly endless forks in front of you. Taking that leap and allowing yourself to be carried for a while by others is so beyond courageous and the first step to getting better. Whether that means being admitted into a hospital or starting medication or simply just speaking to a professional. There are answers but sometimes it takes those closest to us to help. Hope the words of strangers can add to that help. x"
