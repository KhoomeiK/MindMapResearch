HorrorGaming,fqu2n46,t3_gktfil,1589650836.0,"I'll touch on some things other people haven't pointed out yet.  It's obvious with the release of Alien Isolation/Resident Evil 6 and the remakes that horror sells.  Dead Space 1 and 2 sold very well and people loved them.  The 3rd one is still fun, EA just took more creative rights with it than they should have and took it into a more action experience which they could have done better with.


There probably would have been another game but EA shifted Visceral games direction (the studio that made dead space) to make the next big star wars game that was cancelled called 'Project Ragtag', after that Visceral was shut down by EA.  There will never be another Dead Space, the series is done.  However r/deadspace is very much alive :) Currently a superfan of the game series is making a spiritual a successor called 'Negative Atmosphere'. Here's some cool gameplay.
