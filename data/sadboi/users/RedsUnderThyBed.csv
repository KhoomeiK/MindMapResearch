religion,f9fnio8,t3_e3k0km,1575280618.0,"I'm a Norse Pagan myself and I believe that bad things happen to good people for various reasons.

I've studied the ideas of natural and human evil in philosophy so heres my take on it.

Natural evil equates basically to ideas of disease and earthquakes (things from the natural world). For me the Gods are imperfect and therefore created an imperfect world. While oceans and waves are important for cycles of fish development say an unintended consequence would be occasional tsunami. Whilst microbes can be very dangerous some are very important like good gut bacteria perhaps the Gods realise that you can't have one without the other. So perhaps the Gods allowed such a world to exist because a ""less bad"" world on the surface would have terrible consequences.

In terms of human evil there is great debate on free will within Norse theurgy and what that means for ethics which I'm gonna side step a little bit here. However, fate plays an important part in discussions here. The Norns are a similar concept to the Greek fates in Norse Theurgy and exist above the power of the Gods. The debate goes on to how ""fixed"" fate is but for me there appears to be loopholes in a hard deterministic approach as the Gods can get around prophecies. I believe a clear example of this is in the Voluspa where Odin's foreknowledge of Ragnarok may well affect its outcome. I see this therefore that one's own fate at least being somewhat maluable. 

Therefore as fate is somewhat maluable there exists a certain element of free will to agents such as people or Gods. We are therefore somewhat responsible for our actions and therefore people can choose to commit crimes. This doesn't mean that the fates have no power but there is a sort of cosmic check and balance between power. 

Just my take and there are many different ways to interpret the sagas and the actions of the Gods and Norns."

religion,f1cb217,t1_f0lingx,1569353831.0,"Thanks for the response and don't worry about not catching it.

On your first point about Christian family and friends. I live in the UK so generally speaking Christians are more liberal. My nan (read as grandma) was a Catholic and she was good with it when I explained it wasn't black magic. I was discovering my faith as my Pagan uncle was coming back into the family and he was helpful but I preferred my own way of doing things and still do. Currently I practice on my own and prefer to. I've been president of my uni Pagan society it was great but I want my own space rn. In terms of friends when I was in Senior school 11-16 they've always known I come with my faith as well as my homosexuality, even the more Evangelical Christians accepted that. I wouldn't say I wasn't always great friends with them but there was a mutual respect.

In terms of Pantheons. I respect other Pantheons and religions generally. I tend to see the divine as aspects so like wisdom. For me the Norse Gods just ""fit"" for me. If other people are getting what I'm getting from my faith then they must be worshipping the same thing I am in a different way."

But what's always true is that a good name will live forever even though Marcus Arelius was dead cert against the idea he's perhaps one of the best Roman Emperors and philosophers of antiquity. 2000 years of remembrance might as well have been a forever ago. 

So even if you don't believe in anything focus on your actions in this world live a life like how you want to be remembered and you can get immortality that way. Even if I'm wrong at least you've helped others who will help more others. Your life certainly wouldn't have been in vain."

Courage, for me I interpret that as not being afraid to say the right thing to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. Also sometimes courage means the severely depressed person getting out of bed and fighting on.
Truth, pretty self explanatory there.
Honour, similar to courage to but not doing good things for the wrong reasons as well as having integrity in the things that you do.
Fidility, similar to truth and fairly self explanatory.
Discipline, discipline in all things self control from diet to drink to good temper.
Self Reliance, not necessarily meaning that the self is an island but doing your best support yourself wherever possible.
Vigar/Industriousness which for me mean trying to keep that get up and go and staying focused on important tasks.
