You feel this way because you really believe it and you may be right. I won’t try to argue scripture. I’m a terrible Christian.

One came to send my Dad off when he finally passed and it meant a lot to me and my sisters. So thank you for all that you do. I let the anger get the best of me. I’m not doing all that well mentally since my dad recently passed. Actually quite the opposite I’m completely broken down. I guess I just assume everyone on here is like me...Young and dumb.

Regardless, my uncle came to get my Dad as if he was in the room my Dad spoke to him in an odd moment of clarity and my Dad saw the light. I asked my Dad if he could see me and he said “I can’t see you from up here.” I know where he went which at least provides me some comfort."

Offering people the dignity to die when they’re suffering horribly without shitting themselves, clawing desperately at anything, eyes rolling into the back of their head, screaming, moaning, aspirating, their bones shattering from the cancer as they wither away they’re agonizing suffering prolonged.

Not to mention there’s tension between my fiancé and my mom and sisters for some unknown reason. I think no one really wants him here except for me of course. Not that he’s even a bad guy he’s been nothing but super helpful and sweet and paying for groceries and food and everything. He’s just 14 years older and it makes them uncomfortable even though I’m turning 30 this year. 

Count your blessings you have a job and work as hard as you can. I can’t find another job now and neither can he. We both were successful marketing professionals. I quit voluntarily to move across the country to be with my fiancé before the shit hit the fan and I can’t personally even collect unemployment. 

Now my fiancé has to return to NYC and pack up our apartment there and I have to make the choice to go with him and risk giving covid to my 60 plus mother when I return, or telling him to go alone and find a place to stay for a few weeks to quarantine himself. Not to mention I may have an autoimmune thing so it’s risky for me and my mom doesn’t want me to go. He resents me for not going. This could be the beginning of the end.

AskNYC,fpokt0b,t1_fpoc0jl,1588786171.0,"It’s not playing games. It’s about building an emotional connection and rapport with someone before you fuck them. 

There’s a lot of people here yes, but quality people are difficult to find anywhere."
AskNYC,fpokhg8,t1_fpohinp,1588786018.0,"I’m in my 20s and I don’t throw my cat around at everyone without some commitment. It’s kinda sad and weird people have sex with random people they don’t even know like potentially bad people they don’t even know and get used and hurt. You can tell yourself it’s not a big deal but it is. 

Im not a prude or anything I’ve had plenty of great sex with men that cared about me deeply. Ask people to wait a few weeks for sex to her to know someone and they’re like omg no what I have to wait for something I’m out that’s weak."
AskNYC,fpmoa16,t1_fpk383t,1588737544.0,That’s not what I said. I said date them for a month before having sex. That’s like what 4 dates maybe? I absolutely think you should meet people after maybe feeling them out a little to not waste time if there’s no chemistry
AskNYC,fpmnzcf,t1_fpl7vtw,1588737347.0,And maybe you’re a bit triggered? You got lucky I suppose but holding out for sex shows you respect yourself and don’t get naked for someone on the first date. 🤷‍♀️ it’s basically doing it with a stranger. It doesn’t have to be a month or could be a few weeks or whenever someone is comfortable but it should be with some commitment if that’s what your after. If not than I guess do whatever and see what happens but you can’t expect anything to come out of that.
AskNYC,fpmnr82,t1_fplbo2v,1588737198.0,"It’s not a game it’s about getting to know someone without sex involved and no it doesn’t just apply to women but I’m referring to OP specifically. It’s not playing games to want something serious before sex honestly and if you have 4 other dates, good for you bro."
AskNYC,fpl7amu,t1_fpl6gc0,1588707633.0,"I think by desirable you mean douchey :) I live in NYC too but I value myself too much to put out before I have a serious commitment and it worked for me. If anyone pressures you into sex they’re not worth your time. If you want to do it, do it but don’t expect the other person to stick around after. I don’t care how physically attractive, rich, whatever. No one is worth it and there’s always another one around the corner."
AskNYC,fpl6714,t1_fpl5ko5,1588707076.0,A month isn’t that long... If they can’t hold out on sex to get to know someone and date them the. that’s shitty and you’re weeding out the losers. It’s everyone’s choice to sleep with someone but imo it doesn’t get you very far if you want to be serious and get to know each other and that goes both ways. Sex clouds judgement too and you may miss out on some red flags.
Coronavirus,fpl00py,t1_fpkuc12,1588703984.0,I’m not narcissistic enough to believe the world revolves around my story and that nothing bad could happen to me. Bad things happen every day all the time to people.
AskNYC,fpjfpuu,t1_fpirntj,1588666806.0,"Vetting is a yes. Chat for sometime on text, on the phone, and even request a video chat after you build a rapport. Make it clear in your bio you’re looking for a relationship. That cuts some of the b.s. upfront but there will still be guys that want in your pants and see it as a challenge. 

Ask lots of questions without being too serious but try to feel them out. Find out what they’re looking for, if they say they’re not sure they’re a waste of time. 

First date should be casual coffee or whatever so if the chemistry isn’t there you can bounce.

Do not text them first and do not fucking sleep with them. Not for less than a month and not before monogamy is established. That way you weed out the pricks who just want to use you for sex. If you’re horny satisfy yourself. If you want casual sex that’s fine but if you want a serious guy you have to be serious. 

Swiped endlessly before I met my fiancé it’s a numbers game and most of its very disappointing."

Having unnecessary surgery because you can’t accept the way you are is the strangest thing to me especially when it involves removing vital parts of your body. You could never wake up from surgery and it’s painful. She just looks freakish and I find her difficult to look at without wincing. This is not attractive it’s sick. Also, not saying she wants kids but I imagine that would be difficult if not impossible and also maybe doing certain things like breathing properly and using your diaphragms would be more difficult."

Instagramreality,fpihkgc,t1_fpifu2k,1588641052.0,Well to be fair in Europe all the countries are close together so you can easily drive through like 3 countries if you fly to one and we live driving distance from Canada. I don’t mean to sound pretentious that was my first time in Europe but I got a cheap flight and just did it. I compare myself to all of these women on Instagram though who seem to have fabulous lives and travel every week.
Instagramreality,fpi8iwm,t3_gdfybv,1588635795.0,"Cringe... her hair looks shopped too. So embarrassing. It’s sad because most people don’t have the means to go all over the world like this instahoes I see all over the world. Shit I’ve been to Canada, Germany, Austria, Italy just in this year and I still don’t feel well traveled or well dressed :/"
