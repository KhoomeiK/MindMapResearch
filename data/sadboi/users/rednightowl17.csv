mentalhealth,erydg9b,t1_erxb0uo,1561406071.0,"This mess started way before Reagan was president. President Kennedy's well-intentioned Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was intended to move most mental health care, except in the most extreme cases, to community based systems, and also deinstitutionalize most patients and move them to the care of their families or group homes. Would have worked well except that those community clinics, support systems, and group homes weren't in place, and many families were not able financially or emotionally to care for them, before the deinstitutionalization happened, resulting in homelessness and lots of people not getting proper consistent treatment."
