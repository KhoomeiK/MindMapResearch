A couple weeks ago I messaged the teacher to tell him all this for teacher appreciation week and he said his goal as a teacher was to always treat each student like they mattered instead of just a grade like other teachers."

Same with the family I don’t live with, I have their messages on quiet so when they text I can just ignore it or respond later and that’s been a blessing too.

My WiFi in my room sucks so I have been doing it downstairs and tonight all I asked was they be a little respectful and if they want to be loud to just go in the other room. My mom came storming out of the other room and started yelling at me. I have no support. I have no friends because of the bullying and low self esteem, I have no family I can move in with because either they think I’m not abused, they started judging every choice I’ve made in my life or it just makes the abuse worse. I’m 90% sure come next week I’m moving into a motel because I can’t take it anymore.

One example of this that I’ve been thinking of a lot lately and wish I said no, I sew so I have fabric even though I’m still learning so I’m not that good. My cousin has this same fabric but doesn’t have enough because now her daughter wants her grandma to match with them all so my cousin messages me asking if I’d give it to them for money and ship it, she gave me $20 shipping was $15 plus $2 for the box but it’s whatever right that’s what family is for. Well then after I sent it I realized how badly I got played, my cousin never messages, she’s been rude to me the past couple months even calling my dad a liar and I’m not even sure where that came from, her husband never has anything nice to say about me, her oldest daughter used to love me but since we aren’t the same religion the parents swayed that relationship away. Anyway I realized in that text message when she was so nice and me saying yes was a classic example of me not being able to say no to things.
