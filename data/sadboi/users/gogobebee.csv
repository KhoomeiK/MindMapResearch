Not a fan of the excessive swearing but oh well.  Telling people that nobody gives a F about them and they should check their ego is kinda.. off.  It can be damaging for people with anxiety issues such as myself. I have SAD and I while i‚Äôm very much aware that people aren‚Äôt paying attention to me that often,  I just tend to think that way.  It has nothing to do with ‚Äùinflating‚Äù my ego.  Just my anxious thoughts."
