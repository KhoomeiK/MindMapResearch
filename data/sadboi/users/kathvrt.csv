obgyn,fogpzhr,t1_fog8blj,1587755640.0,"Thank you so much. I feel like I was almost gaslit by my mom and the doctors I’ve seen into believing that this isn’t real and I need to stop complaining about it. I know that’s not their intention but it hurts so much when I’ve been struggling with this problem I feel immense shame about, I finally come out and talk about it, and people still invalidate it and say it’s normal. I really appreciate the advice."
obgyn,fog3s8z,t1_fog29jq,1587747492.0,"I will definitely ask about antibiotics and maybe schedule a phone appt for the time being, thank you so much."
obgyn,fog1hnq,t1_fog16yt,1587746492.0,"I’ve never been prescribed an antibiotic but I will ask about that. Itching comes and goes throughout my life, I think the majority of which is caused by shaving my pubic hair. I’m gonna go back to waxing once we get out of quarantine."
obgyn,fog0184,t1_fof9mhc,1587745788.0,"I haven’t been underweight since high school but I do know that my unhealthy eating is probably the cause of this.

obgyn,fofzocj,t1_fof6izw,1587745614.0,It doesn’t seem like you read the whole post. I said in the post that I’ve tried probiotics that were specific to vaginal health and they made the odor much worse. I also said in the post that I had a wet mount test done which I’m pretty sure the doc said was to check for things like BV. I also said in the post that I’ve only worn breathable cotton underwear my entire life.
obgyn,fofzc7r,t1_fof40xt,1587745449.0,"Honestly I’m pretty exhausted by doctors always trying to tell me it’s “normal.” There is no way this is what life is supposed to be like. It’s not just that I’m a little shy about body odor. I can’t begin to explain how bad it is. I guess I tried my best but it still didn’t come across. Let’s even just remove all social fears for a second, even if I wasn’t extremely ashamed and embarrassed about it, I would still be suffering. Because I smell it constantly and it’s disgusting and I’m always uncomfortable. I’ve heard “it’s normal” so many times that I’m about to give up because nobody is taking me seriously. 

I have had STD screenings (last one was in November 2019) that came back perfectly clean. I was not assaulted as a child."

obgyn,foet204,t1_foeswqc,1587713785.0,That’s interesting advice that I’ve never heard haha. And it’s just an antihistamine so it’s not like it could hurt to try. I’ll ask a doc about it though when I can.

obgyn,foerwuy,t1_foern8p,1587712677.0,"Well I wasn't necessarily asking for advice on my eating habits.  Like I said, it's a psychological problem that I'm working on with therapists & medication.  It's not just like ""just drink water every time you feel hungry!!!"" cause that's not going to solve my issues at all.  I've tried various tips and tricks from ""health and fitness.""  Those kinds of ""diets"" or ""restrictions"" don't work for me because I am mentally ill.

There is no way in hell the smell is in my head.  It's so strong and so terrible.

I’ve been having my breakdowns at night when I turn off all distractions and have to be alone with my thoughts.

I’m far from suicidal but I’m desperate for others to notice & validate my pain and suffering so I fantasize about scenarios where people I love and respect are there for me during a crisis.

I sound so dramatic right now lol but I do truly feel that I was traumatized by that specific situation.  I don't even have feelings for him anymore and he & his gf are a great couple who I love.

HermitCraft,flnyl3m,t3_fpu4bv,1585328328.0,"I’ve been getting so frustrated with the chat in some hermits streams. For example on a Cub stream everyone was going on and on and on about Grian and spamming the same things over and over (“pesky bird,” “grian took your door,” etc.) Even when Cub told them all “sorry guys were not gonna see grain during this stream” people kept begging him to go find Grian and kill him for the head hunt. It’s so much more fun to watch a Hermits stream and learn what they themselves are doing on the server rather than just going on and on about Grian or Mumbo. Imagine how it makes hermits like cub feel when ppl go into their stream and ignore everything they are saying and doing and just ask for Grian."
mentalhealth,flfo6pw,t1_flfno31,1585112092.0,Ya’ll are trying to tell me my debilitating loneliness isn’t real. Of course I’m gonna get pissed off about it.

mentalhealth,fldmqbr,t1_flbq8gk,1585067625.0,Thanks I wish I was dead
mentalhealth,fldld56,t1_flcu94x,1585066848.0,You have no idea what I’ve been through. Just because I’ve gotten laid before doesn’t mean I’m supposed to be happy and grateful. The men Ive fucked treated me like absolute shit. No one has ever loved me. I don’t have to prove my loneliness to you. Sex does not equal emotional connection which is what I’ve been longing for my entire life and never received. Leave me alone I’m done with you people.
mentalhealth,flbx3zn,t1_flbwki2,1585014641.0,Sorry but I’m not interested in trying to argue with someone of your distorted mindset because no matter what I say you will continue to think the way you think. I’m not interested in continuing to humor someone who called me a cunt. So I’m done with this convo have a nice day.
mentalhealth,flbwzln,t1_flbwki2,1585014559.0,Thanks for invalidating all the pain those men have put my through by saying they were just being social awkward. Bruh social awkwardness does not equal being an emotionally abusive asshole. And yes I have immense privilege as a white American but my status as a woman is not something others “dream” of. And truly it’s creepy that you somehow know I’m a white American when I don’t have a photo on my profile.
mentalhealth,flbw0x4,t1_flbvxfg,1585013921.0,Exactly I failed to mention to them that I actually haven’t had sex in over a year and I hardly ever see or talk to people besides at work.
mentalhealth,flbuks7,t1_flbt0py,1585012949.0,"As a woman, I am often afraid to go out in public. To the bar, to the movies, to my car in the parking lot. Because men like you feel like women owe them something and they decide to take it. Sorry you think I’m more privileged than you. I have been fucked and left on the couch without the guy saying a word to me. I was fucked several times without a condom when I told the guy explicitly several times that I wanted him to wear one. I was told to get the fuck out of a guys house once he was done fucking me. So sure, men are just kissing my feet everywhere I go. Or rather, men have always only ever treated me like complete shit. My dad, my male friends, my past romantic interests. Whether they are ugly or hot. It doesn’t matter."

niceguys,flbsft0,t1_flbs4dt,1585011560.0,Cool. Women can also experience severe loneliness. I’m tired of ya’ll invalidating my debilitating loneliness just because I’m a woman.
niceguys,flbsdlw,t1_flbsazk,1585011520.0,That’s exactly what I said and he said “of course your over sensitive ass thinks I’m threatening you WHICH IM NOT” lmao
mentalhealth,flbs72d,t1_flbs0t2,1585011401.0,You have an extremely distorted view of reality. You need to seek help immediately. That mentality is dangerous to both you and others.

I’m over here desperately trying to make connections and you’re telling me I’m doing it wrong and I’m pushing everyone away with my negativity, which is exactly the thing I’m insecure about. You’re not the first person to say this to me. I already know I’m a Debbie downer and my anxiety is exhausting for everyone and no one wants to be around me cause I’m so negative. It’s kinda hard not to be when you have severe depression & anxiety!!!!! And I have been journaling regularly for 20 years."
mentalhealth,flb3e9h,t1_flb01cx,1584996568.0,"“Nice guy” and “simp” are not derogatory terms. Those kinds of men chose to act that way, which is usually belittling and demeaning towards women. So they deserve to be called names. Sorry if you think that’s an extremist point of view but it’s not. As a woman I have had so many bad experiences with men (both online and off, sexually or not) that it is clear to me that men collectively are not on my side. But go ahead with the “not all men” mentality and calling me a femcel."
mentalhealth,flb2xkp,t1_flaw726,1584996294.0,This is exactly how I feel. I watch friends break up with someone and immediately find someone new and I’m just like “how can they find someone so easily and I can’t find one person who wants me?” Watching other people kiss and be romantic is actually physically painful to me and I have to cringe and look away. I avoid all movies & TV shows & books with romantic story lines (which is almost all of them). Watching one romance scene can send me spiraling into a breakdown. But people always assume I’m just being dramatic and bitter. So I beat myself up for it.
mentalhealth,flb2c4k,t1_flb259r,1584995947.0,Then how... are you supposed to... express your frustrations and other feelings..... to me having a social connection means being able to share your feelings with each other and validate each other and support each other. Not just not talk about your feelings cause you don’t wanna be “toxic.”

But even if there wasn't a pandemic it's not really that easy for me to just go outside and make friends.  As if I haven't already thought of that solution.  I have two therapists, so I already have solid sources for psychological help.

mentalhealth,flal0cr,t1_fla55ii,1584985955.0,The r /lonely sub says that it’s for lonely people to come and feel welcomed by other lonely people to express their loneliness. Where in that description does it say you have to be a virgin or be unable to “find sex”
mentalhealth,flakhnq,t1_flabtps,1584985665.0,"It was 3 or 4 people commenting different bullshit. One claiming I’m too easy, one saying I don’t belong, one telling me my standards are too high and if I just went for the ugly guys I’d find they’d be happy to have any girl. Call me crazy but that doesn’t sound appealing, to settle for someone I’m not attracted to just because HE NEEDS WOMAN"
mentalhealth,flajwtt,t1_fla6ggi,1584985343.0,"Thank you so much, reading this made me feel like 100x better cause that’s exactly what I’m experiencing. My therapist recommended volunteering at an animal shelter and I think I’m gonna look into that once the virus has passed (hopefully)"
mentalhealth,flajn8y,t1_fla76kg,1584985195.0,YES this is almost exactly what I am experiencing too. I have friends but none of them are really safe friends I can go to in a crisis who will be understanding and supportive and validating. People often don’t get it when I say I’m lonely they’re like “but you have so many great friends!” You can still be lonely when surrounded by others.
mentalhealth,flajezp,t1_fla4yjs,1584985069.0,Thank you this is really kind and helpful. I’ve always hated the sentiment of “you can’t love anyone until you love yourself!!!” Cause it always sounded like “if you’re not confident in yourself you are unlovable.” But the way you’ve put it makes so much more sense to me.

In the depths of my anxiety & depression it's not that easy to just go out and meet people.  Maybe you perceive me as ""easy"" but I don't give it up to just anyone.

lonely,fl7a401,t1_fl79q9a,1584897502.0,"but..... attractiveness is 100% subjective, the guys who are attractive to me are not the same men that are attractive to someone else.  this black and white thinking of ""ugly nice guys always lose and hot mean guys always win"" is a completely fabricated version of reality. some of the men I've had sex with were actually kind and caring and everything I could ever ask for, they just were too emotionally or mentally unstable for a relationship.  You're also implying that I'm shallow and only go for men that are 10/10 models when in reality I don't have standards that high at all.  Some men I've fucked were ugly and mean."
lonely,fl78w35,t1_fl78p5a,1584896769.0,"right, it's totally my fault for being attracted to attractive people.  lemme just settle down with someone who I have no attraction to, just cause he'll be more ""loyal.""  also how ya'll know what the men I've fucked look like???"

lonely,fjzmdyb,t3_ffh7x7,1583723224.0,I get extremely irritated when people post things on social media about how great their lives are and how much fun they’re having traveling and shit. But I know that’s a character flaw on my part. People aren’t wrong for posting about things they’re excited about. I’m just a bitter bitch.

mentalhealth,fjnwpsm,t3_fed7in,1583515845.0,Honestly I’ve never been turned off or annoyed by a smaller dick. In fact dicks that are more than 7” can often be intimidating to handle. Confidence and taking care of the person you’re with is so much more important than how big your dick is. Truly your body is great just the way it is.
