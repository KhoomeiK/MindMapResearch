I got one for you...

So at a party, made some brownies, ate one as you do and waited for them to kick in. Normal shit goes down until me and my mate.... lets call him dave.... get the munchies and go looking for food. We find a plate full of honey brushed chocolate chip cookies... IKR... like a little gift sent from heaven. After eating about 6 of the each, my other mate.... let's call him fred... walks in and tells us they were laced too! We stood laughing at each other for a bit and went upstairs to see what they were doing on the Xbox. 

So there I am sat in my own little bubble with Dave when he starts stroking his face! 

Me: what you doing dude?

Dave: man you got to feel this... my face feels like butter!

M: WHAT!

D: Seriously dude, have a go of this, its mad!

Soooooo I started stroking his face with my hands and sure enough it feels like butter. That when Fred walks in like ""wtf are you two doing""

I over excitedly replied ""Get on this man... HIS FACE ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE BUTTER"" 

He didnt have a go but to this day I can remember how his face felt like stroking a brick of butter.

Which reminds me of another one.... 

Fell asleep on my bedroom floor once, high as a kite, Dave in my bed, when I start laughing uncontrollably waking dave up. 

Fred and my brother are downstairs having a full blown row over who's reflection looked the best in the back of a spoon xD I shit you not!
