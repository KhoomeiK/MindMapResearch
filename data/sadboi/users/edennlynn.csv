Intent is great, but it really means nothing if the actions and words don’t match.

It was all to make him feel good about himself, not to truly celebrate HER.

mentalhealth,fq013zm,t3_ggc32u,1589026507.0,"First, I’m so sorry you’re experiencing this. 

With the exception of the physical violence, your moms bf sounds a lot like my best friends dad, who is a narcissist and emotionally abusive. What I can say from what you’ve written and my experience with my friends dad, is that you often don’t see the worst of it for a while. Ask yourself, have things escalated since they first got together?

Narcissists are champions of passing blame and making others feel like THEY’RE the problem. Deflection, avoidance, outbursts on small occurrences (I.e. the music thing), and changing demeanour depending on the environment (at home vs public) are all problematic. I don’t know what your relationship with your mom is like, but it’s very possible that he has convinced her the issues you have with him/his behaviour are “blown out of proportion” and nothing to do with him. Acting nice or doing favours doesn’t cancel out the abusive behaviour!

Definitely try to talk to someone you trust about it- maybe to someone who knows them as well as an outsider perspective. In my experience, I’ve found it helpful to keep a note in my phone (or somewhere he wouldn’t see it) of all the things he says or does that you find hurtful, abusive, or just mean. It can help you see how often things are happening, patterns of behaviour, and to remind yourself that no matter what anyone says, those experiences were hurtful to YOU. They are valid."

Tylenol 3's are not my fav, they aren't effective unless you take a lot, and they really screw up my digestive system. I end up in more pain :( Cannabis has helped a lot with pain and tension. T3's are a weak opioid, but we've all read the road opioids lead to."

You're grieving the life you had, and the one you envisioned, you know? So don't be hard on yourself for it or rush to accept it. I've felt that a better focus is trying to accept each day and constantly gauging how you're doing- that way you can handle the symptoms instead of trying to tackle everything fibro entails.

If you don't mind me asking, what kind of therapy have you tried? There's a couple different approaches- I started with a CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) therapist, but it didn't really work for me. I'm currently seeing a psychotherapist, and I'm really finding it waaaay more helpful. I also have realized the importance of finding the right therapist- someone you connect with on a general level, someone who acknowledges your issues but isn't making a huge deal of them (nothing like feeling like you can't share your dark thoughts...), someone who challenges you with kindness. My therapist is really good at listening to what I say and repeating it back in a way that makes me see my issues in a new light- she helps me see patterns and establish how to rework my thinking patterns.  


There's also a ton of medication options and combinations to try- it's a long, gruelling process at times though. I've tried at least 8 or 9 different medications at various doses and combinations with other anti-depressants. If you're able, try to have your doctor refer you to a psychiatrist.

Fibromyalgia,ew32ctk,t3_clziip,1565062096.0,"I had one done about a month ago, and need to ave another one at the end of this month. My test was more about the insomnia and anxiety/heart rate, less about dizziness. But they found out I have sleep apnea, so I stop breathing and then my heart has to work super hard to wake me up to breathe again. They think some of the dizziness could be related to lack of sleep/REM and my body just generally working overtime. But there always seems to be more tests :(  
Best of luck to you!"
Fibromyalgia,ew313p7,t3_cmaegp,1565061095.0,"I have tried a couple different strains and ratios of CBD:THC as well as methods of consumption (smoking, vaping, edibles, capsules), and I've found that a combination of THC and CBD helps me the most. It doesn't take away the pain, but it helps dull it and relax me, which is much needed. I think a tiny bit of THC helps kick start the CBD, but that's just my thought. It really has helped me with mood, too- I am a lot less irritable and anxious!!"

Fibromyalgia,eunavzo,t3_cgyn2y,1563926418.0,"I'm in Ontario, Canada, and we've had wicked heat lately too :(  


I wet washcloths and stick them in the freezer, or put cold water in a spray bottle to spritz on myself for a cool mist. A/C or a fan helps too- I find that moving air helps me feel less of that heat-suffocation. With some fans, you can drape a bag of ice or flexible ice pack over it (careful not to have it touch the fan blades) to blow cold air.  If you have a tub, put some cool/cold water in there and sit in it for a while. If you're needing to be sitting or lying down, try to flip your pillow every once in a while so the heat from your head doesn't get trapped in the pillow. Or maybe even put pillowcases in the freezer for a bit haha, I just thought of that.   


Hope this can help you!"
Fibromyalgia,eun8bi8,t3_cgy6yp,1563925508.0,"First off I want to say THANK YOU for being there for your partner. It should be a given, but a lot of people don't have a partner that ""gets it"" enough (especially since flares are not super visible).

&#x200B;

Personally, I have found that marijuana helps- high CBD strains, and I prefer either edibles, capsules, or vaping, as smoking makes my throat hurt. 

Heat also helps me, so I have an electric heating pad, or take a warm bath (usually with epsom and Himalayan salts). If she is able, being in water/swimming is really good to still get moving, but relieve some pressure. 

If her skin isn't too sensitive, sometimes massaging coconut oil in stiff spots is good. 

But I agree with other's comments in that being with her is amazing. Thinking of something to do (like watching a movie, etc.) and getting all of it ready could be a good way of making her feel less ""sick"", and that resting is part of the activity, you know?"

Fibromyalgia,er3z503,t3_by7fve,1560476747.0,"I saw three different doctors that refused to prescribe me opioids (I didn't want to start them either). Then I was prescribed Tylenol 3/Codeine for bad flares. I've always had issues with meds not being as ""strong"" as my doctor says it will be, so I don't have much improvement with it. It messes up my digestive system a bit, and I'm terrified of withdrawal (been through it with benzo's, it was awful). I prefer to use cannabis for both pain and anxiety- indica dominant strains with a higher level of CBD:THC. I'm thankful that marijuana is now legal recreationally where I live, since my doctor's won't refer me for a medical card. They're quicker to prescribe opioids when I'm hesitant about that, than marijuana when I'm telling them it works :(

If you want to explore MMJ a bit more, I recommend CBD oils (tinctures), or vaping (vs smoking). You can get strains with very little THC, so you don't get that ""couch potato"" high where you can't really do anything. Best of luck!!"
