AskAnAmerican,fqt12vx,t3_gkgmwh,1589626284.0," yea but only for certain crimes. for instance i certainly don't care for a rapist, child rapist, murderer, etc. very harsh, common sense crimes you know you shouldn't do. they forfeit their life or human rights for being such monsters.

 smaller things like weed or small theft(because it depends on what is stolen too. however i don't really excuse theft of ANY kind because no one is entitled to steal anything that does not belong to them.) shouldn't be treated the same. those ppl *might* be able to be rehabilitated into not stealing or whatever. 

too bad we don't or maybe can't? idk, differentiate the extent of the crime and how they are treated or where they are put in terms of prison. prison is NOT supposed to be a nice place to go. you don't WANT to go there so i don't agree in any form of reforming prisons to make them nicer. its not supposed to be a good place to end up. imo making normal mistakes is not the same as making a ""mistake"" that lands you in prison. those are 2 very different things."

it might be harsh of me to say those who procreate are selfish, but that's what i feel. i can imagine all the already existing thousands of kids who would have loved that home. how can you not see something like this and think, ""nah fuck that."" everyone is free to do and think what they want, but man. how can you beat making someone's life happier this way?

he said ah okay. and then asked if i wanted to see pictures of his dick. i was like 'dude? why would you ask me that?' he was like 'idk, ive just been really wanting to show myself to others like that.' i said 'you know how i am with that kinda stuff. is that what you see me as?' hes like 'well, i thought you would be over it by now.'

but no, she ended up pregnant & said that she wasn't really doing anything, if she had a career she'd never have kept it. now my nephew unfortunately exists & he is basically a grandma's boy cause all my sis likes to do is play video games all day & sometimes give him attention. but my mom gives him mental nurturing & actual play time so figures why he likes her more. 

now shes trying to go back to school & i said why? she wants a job & to make money & i said well, you had the chance & you decided to have a kid instead. she said she didn't realize how difficult it was. yeah?? no shit! now cause of the 'rona her schooling is being postponed until further notice. 

what bothers me is that when i applied for fasfa, my grant would have only been around 5k? that covers hardly anything. she was granted 24k. so that leaves only about 1k my dad will end up paying off for her schooling. i want to assume she got so much because she has a kid. but she went thru financial aid at the college. idk if that helped any but i haven't even bothered with higher education due to cost. sigh. its like everything seems handed out to ppl who needlessly procreate, while us others who are more responsible with our lives always get the short end of the stick."

the discoloration on her stockings is b/c this image has been thru filters so the saturation is very ""bold."" and the lump is probably her butt. if her butt looks that bad on her open leg, that lump on the standing leg is probs what it is. fake butt, mind you lol

TheRightCantMeme,fmixi6j,t1_fmiwvhb,1586118899.0,"To be honest tho, in my opinion, what someone does to themselves does not affect anyone else except them. So regardless of what i feel/think and what someone else thinks, ppl should be able to chose Whats right for their own bodies. 

Like someone could get an abortion and it has no affect on me or you for instance. It becomes a problem when ppl are forcing things on others, forcing someone to be pregnant or forcing someone to get an abortion, etc. Thats why i think the ability to choose is very crucial and i wouldn't wanna lose that option. Because if you remove the choice, it becomes force. And i am against forcing anyone to do anything against their will.

Within reason ofc. Because an abortion only affects 1 person. But mandatory staying indoors so a contagious virus doesn't spread to others is another thing. And ik ppl will most definitely be dense and try to twist my words lol. So i will just say that now."
TheRightCantMeme,fmiw7b5,t1_fmipj1x,1586118157.0,"I feel like that's too contradictory. If one thinks its a child, they would think abortion = murder when its simply not comparable. I know there are ppl who do think it's an actual child, however due to extreme circumstances, might understand why someone has an abortion, like incest, rape, life threatening to the mom. 

But then why would those circumstances be ok and not others? If it essentially ends in the ""murder"" of a child. 

I don't view it as life as it hasn't existed yet. The moment you are born and take your first breath you are, for better or worse, alive."
TheRightCantMeme,fmiojn9,t1_fminm2w,1586113719.0,"That's probably what pro life ppl hear because they believe the entire process of pregnancy, there is a child inside the womb. They apply personal feelings and personify the fetus so they view it differently. 

It's not the case, but you can't force them to agree. Which is why having the choice is so important. Ppl might think the fetus has more right to live than the already established human that its invading, but others don't see it that way. Pro-life is actually pro-birth. They get the two mixed up all the time. One someone actually exists, ie, is born, they are on their own. 

I think women should have the options available to do what's best for them in their life. And we all know VERY well not everyone is fit to be a parent."
TheRightCantMeme,fmg5lma,t1_fmg16pt,1586041748.0,"Late term abortions are rarely done. Because in most of those cases the pregnant woman wanted the kid. So they would have already applied personhood/personal feelings to the fetus. So they wouldn't have wanted to abort their potential baby, but had to due to a dire emergency.

I can see where you might think body autonomy wouldn't be a great argument due to differences in opinion/perception. Which is why this and many other issues will never be solved. Because no one will ever all come into agreement for anything. Its impossible due to us being humans.

However, you aren't allowed to take the organs or sexually abuse/rape a corpse. By law they are protected despite not being able to say otherwise because they are dead. They still retain rights despite not being alive anymore. Where as a completely live woman has the ability to give consent because she is alive.

If you are alive for 5 years, you are 5 years old. You are left to starve and die? That is negligence and is against the law. It's wrong.

A woman who wants to terminate her pregnancy is not comparable as the zygote or early term fetus is no where near viable like the already established 5 year old left to starve."

This virus spreads and can be fatal to anyone. It's not just old ppl. You aren't risking just yourself. The virus doesn't just stay inside only you, it spreads. 

You could be the reason someone's parent dies, or their child who has respiratory issues dies. That's why they want us to minimize the spread. Not only that, this bullshit virus could be done and over with much sooner than later if ppl would just listen. But I'm almost certain the effects of this virus might just last well within to the rest of this year.

Advice,flburqq,t3_fnoo0u,1585013079.0,"I'd calm down and then just kinda like... Take in the reality? If that makes sense. Understand your current situation first. Think about what you personally want to do. I don't know where you are from but hopefully there are options available where you live. 

Children are a big life change that is permanent. Are you prepared to change your life to cater to your potential baby? Are you yourself in a safe/stable household that would be a good environment to raise a baby? Are you prepared to work and provide what you can while possibly sacrificing your needs? 

It might sound scary and a bit deterring, but children aren't toys and easy to care for. You have to be 100% sure you are willing to care for them forever or at least until they are self sufficient. You can't always guarantee their health either. If they end up being born with some disability or have an accident in their life are you willing to care for that as well? 

Second would be keeping the pregnancy and then giving the baby up for adoption. You can even meet the family and get to know them as well before signing over the rights so you know they will grow up in a loving and adequate home. If you are able to find them a home asap that is great! There are about 400k kids lost in the system and children who are there end up abused in some form of way. It's very sad. That's a lot of kids!

3rd would be abortion. If you have access to and want to consider it, you have every right to do so. You don't need to be pregnant if you don't want to. Also, if you are living in a dangerous situation or just not in a good spot, you don't want to force someone to also be in that situation. 

Don't ever feel forced to do anything you don't want to. If you want to keep the pregnancy, do do. If you don't want to keep the pregnancy, do so. 

If you are able to, you should try to consult the father and your parents. Try not to take this responsibility on your own."

Sometimes i almost don't care and think i should just do it, but ive never been an impulsive person. And I can't cause another pain to my mom like that.

I read a comment saying that if you died, you wouldn't be there to help ease the suffering of someone else who could need you. This comment reminded me why I even made my goal 30 years old to begin with. I am tired. But in the mean time I wanna help make others feel good around me.

If she wasn't prepared to make sure her kids are first until they are capable adults, like 18 or even 21, then you guys shouldn't have had kids to begin with. Once you chose to have those kids you sacrifice yourself until they are old enough to handle their own. Was she actually genuinely attentive/loving when they were kids? Or did she do it because she had no other choice? There's a difference between wanting to and then HAVING to because there's no other option basically.

Maybe you two can find some type of counseling or something? I'm not sure. But she needs to understand that her kids are still kids and they still need to be taken into consideration. She can't just ignore em for her wants first."
