Wildlands,fqvswoe,t1_fqrfaed,1589684438.0,"Thats actually pretty neat.

 All six of my character slots, corresponding slots for my a.i. team included, have a different look and purpose to them.  One slot is a 2001 GR roleplaying setup, another is GRAW-esque, and my favorite team setup is a casual-paramilitary (utilizing CrossCom when the operation dictates) setup with my sniper as a Bolivian female marksman and laison.

You should share a photo of the team sometime!"

I used to refrain from using the fence torch until a buddy began using it. I did just fine without it but once I started using it I can't go back lol Now we use the torch all the time. Its a HUGE game changer. Imagine if rappelling were to be implemented."
GhostReconWildlands,fqt89g0,t3_gksovs,1589632911.0,The options are endless. There are so many ways to take a situation.  So many things to do that don't even revolve around combat. Excursions are my favorite activity. I find it odd that some folks get bored and say the game is bland or empty. It so odd to me.

Wildlands,fqbe831,t3_ghuero,1589235360.0,"Im down, but lagging and rubberbanding are pretty commonplace when there are more than 2 players. I've tried it with multiple folks and it never lasts long.

It would be a tad better to just play the normal game on extreme with rules regarding drone usage(no medic drone,single use explosive drone etc) and no vic spawning. I play with my compass and items/ammo. I also opt for slow and low movements with the occasional sprint between points. No running and gunning from my end."
GhostRecon,fq93gnv,t1_fq8uifn,1589184206.0,I feel the same as well. I have the most fun when its merely another player and I. Even if its a random player. Often the other 2 are off doing their OWN 2 man coop deal across the map anyways.

The character is janky,slow to react, moves to sporadically in tight areas, and the muzzle climb is extreme on the weapons(as if the character can't shoot for his life )  Nomad must be suffering an extreme TBI from that crash to be so incompetent with basic motor skills. I've also noticed that ground units don't always die when shot with rockets out of the helicopters...I have video feed of it happening multiple times.

Wildlands,fpguv94,t1_fpgu92z,1588609932.0,I will say that a well placed rocket will substantially pave the way for a couple of equally well placed rifle shots on any drone except the Behemoths. Takes time and planning but even then its not always a promise. My experience is rather limited since i just avoid all drones in general. The rocket placement+a few finishing touches seems to be a decent strategy. Drones are also on highest alert/chase when i did this. Simple magdumping proved to be unreliable and tedious more so without gear leveling though.

GhostRecon,fpg9uth,t1_fpg8sfw,1588598073.0,"Lol those heavies are something eles

To redact my bullet sponge question, you're right ,they're not bullet sponges,the weapons just have way to much muzzle climb on immersive (no gear/weapon stats and buffing) and make it difficult to dish out consistent accurate shots. Give me a barebones m9 on Breakpoint and Nomad will let that thing climb 10 feet at medium range with a few shots, let me do that with the barebones m9 on Wildlands and the shot placement is on par with someone who can shoot decently irl.  I worked at my shooting for months and it never got a good as i wish it was. I'll admit I'm terrible now that I'm on it less,but that muzzle climb though."
Wildlands,fpg5sl3,t1_fpg01b2,1588595054.0,I noticed the drones take longer to destroy on immersive and enemies dont seem to want to go down within a reasonable amount of rounds. I figured it was due to the lack of gear leveling and special gear buffs.
