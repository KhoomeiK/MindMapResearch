Iâ€™ve watched him spend like crazy and go onto these costly vacations. I know we were in my grandparents will they had asked for our socials and made us sign it when we were younger. My brother have asked him from time to time if he could help us at all. He never replies. My brother has 5 kids all under 7 years old.  We forth would have been happy if he paid our cars off or anything. But I havenâ€™t heard from him in almost 3 years. I can message I love you dad I miss you and no reply.  His new wife has bad mouthed me for years. He just literally traded his old family for and new uglier one. I try every day to forgive him but am having such a hard time with it.  We were always so close growing up and now nothing. And I mean nothing. No Birthday hi or anything. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t exist.
