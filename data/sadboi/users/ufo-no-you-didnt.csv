makeuporganization,fqq0iux,t1_fq5z9t9,1589557303.0,Thank you for posting the link to the mirror especially! My current mirror was super cheap and  is literally the worst. It only takes batteries and sucks them up like it's nothing.

I am almost finished my first full day back at the office and have been having a ton of feelings. I checked my work planner that I keep at my desk and my last entry was on 3/15.  I was truly thriving being home. I was extremely productive both mentally and physically, and I felt the least amount of anxiety and depression that I had had in years. I continued my weekly therapy sessions via facetime and my therapist reassured me that it was okay to feel that way and that many of her other patients with anxiety, etc, felt the same. Unfortunately, only some parts of my job/work responsibilities can be done remotely and the rest I need to be in office for so much like you, working from home full-time isn't an option. You are def not alone!

Side note- This is also my first full 8 hour day wearing jeans and a real bra and I feel like I'm about to burst out of them both, lol."

PanPorn,for04r1,t3_g93g2i,1588003869.0,"1) Clinique moisture surge hydrating supercharged concentrate

One of the girls at Ulta recommended this to me a while back when I was having problems with dry/dehydrated skin and wanted to try something new. I liked it enough- I wouldn't say this was so amazing that it's one of my must haves but it was pretty moisturizing and lasted a while.

2) First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads

I originally got these in a Boxycharm box and really liked them. I actually ended up repurchasing these in Boxycharm add ons. I like to use these a few times a week in the evenings after cleansing but before doing toner/serum/moisturizer. I feel like they made my skin look smoother and more radiant for sure.

3) Pixi skintreats Glow Tonic

I LOVE this stuff. I've purchased it multiple times over the last few years and like to rotate it with other toners when I want to try something new. I definitely notice my skin looking smoother, clearer, and brighter after using it.

4) Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask

I originally purchased the larger jar of this twice then got this smaller jar in a gift set around the holidays. I LOVE it so much. The smell alone makes it worth buying. I will admit that I was using it all wrong at first and once I started using it correctly, I noticed how bright, plump, and smooth it made my skin. Once I use up the other sleeping mask that I have, I think I'm going to repurchase this.

boxycharm,fofe8j1,t3_g5u0pe,1587733894.0,"I had wanted to try/use fenty products for a while so I was happy to only pay like ~$35 for a bunch of them. I wasn’t sure what to expect but was honestly happy with most everything in the box. I have been using the eyeshadow shades along with my other palettes and the blotting papers are great to leave in my desk at work. I like the gloss too and use it over some of my lip stains or mixed with my lip oils. My only big complaint was that I got the purple matchstick and I had just gotten rid of a purple holographic highlighter like two weeks before that, lol. I would have much rather preferred really any other shade but that. 

I will note that in my free time I do a lot of costume-like/special effects makeup then take pictures for my IG, (not on a remotely professional scale whatsoever. I just wanted an avenue to channel my awful ADHD and anxiety),  so even when I’m not super crazy about makeup products that I get in subscription boxes for my everyday makeup, I have usually been able to find a way to use them when I do more elaborate looks for fun.

dailywash,fo6sprg,t3_g5lr7r,1587565997.0,"My rebuttal every time someone gets on me for washing my hair daily, (or every other day if I wear it up in a bun), is that in 2015 when I had surgery, I didn't wash my hair more than maybe once a week for several months. This was before I started my first big girl job so I was home for a few months recovering and wanted to ""train my hair."" Not only did I look like a greasy mess after a day or two, but I felt like a greasy mess and dry shampoo only made my scalp itchy and flaky. I have been 100x happier with how my hair feels and looks after just saying screw it and washing it as often as I wanted and my hair grows just fine. Sure, my hair is a bit on the drier side on the bottom because of washing, dying, and heat styling but I use sprays, masks, etc, to help with that, get haircuts a few times a year, etc.. The only issues I've had with hair not growing properly in years was from over bleaching my hair and it breaking. 

All in all, it comes down to doing what's best for yourself and figuring out what works. Also, accepting what works for one person might not work for everyone."

PanPorn,fmzzjdh,t1_fmzp1xc,1586532649.0,"Right?! The tiny bottle is especially adorable. This was the first time I ordered from Olehenriksen directly instead of getting it from Sephora and they were offering a free tiny bottle with their online purchases. 

I started using it end of November/beginning of December last year. I picked up a limited edition Olhenriksen holiday gift set last minute at Sephora and decided to finally try it out. I had tested it in store a few times and loved the scent. I honestly noticed a difference a day or two after using it for the first time. I felt like my skin looked brighter and more plump and I actually had someone compliment my skin that first week so I was totally sold. I really like that it doesn't stay sticky for long after applying and the scent is INCREDIBLE.

Just a random side note, the first gift that I bought came with the banana bright eye cream, c-gel moisturizer, and their primer as well and I liked all of the products. Since that particular gift set was limited, the next time I repurchased I got a similar set that only came with the serum, eye cream, and moisturizer. I believe I repurchased that same set one more time after that? and now finally pulled the trigger for the biggest (most expensive) size of the serum. I still have a full eye cream left so I didn't purchase it this time but 100% plan to repurchase that in the future. The moisturizer is good but I still prefer my neutrogena gel cream, especially for the price.

EDIT- I spelled Olhenriksen wrong at least twice but I think I fixed it, lol."

I can totally PM some of the links for nail tools, etc, but as far as kits go, I got the one from the brand Lavender Violets and it’s been really great for the price (~$40 for a starter kit). 

I’ve been getting my nails done at the salon for years and years so I had some idea of the application process prior to using the kit. However, I will admit that my first set took me a long time to do but I also was learning how to use a drill for the first time and tried using tips for the first time. I definitely think it would have been easier if I had did it on my natural nails and just used a nail file to shape and thin out the powder. 

I’ve only done a few sets for practice over the last 6 months and still occasionally go to the salon when my hands need a bit more TLC but I think it is totally worth the investment.

My life has totally changed from it-it's affected most every aspect of my life. Though I'll struggle to some extent, I think some sort of equilibrium is possible. When I take a second to reflect on where I am in life right now, I'm doing really well despite my upbringing.
