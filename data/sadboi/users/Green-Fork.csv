SuicideWatch,f45pxpz,t1_f45fd3b,1571389318.0,I've read it from a psychology book. And battle tested it. Seems to be true
SuicideWatch,f45pup3,t1_f45f5gs,1571389191.0,Anything in particular which stops you from being happy? Drinking is probably the very thing that fills this hole
SuicideWatch,f45esvx,t1_f44jirr,1571374323.0,"I think that is good enough, you probably don't need to account for every possibility in the future. How is your day today?"
SuicideWatch,f45egqh,t1_f447nbw,1571373970.0,I see. And what is usually the reason you can't stop drinking? I guess you tried to stop doing it but didn't have much success.
SuicideWatch,f45e29y,t1_f42n3fo,1571373561.0,"I mean doing it with no motivation whatsoever just because you need to do it. Some people think that they need motivation first and only then they can start accomplishing their plans. It is not always true. But the opposite is correct more often - once you start doing things, your motivation wakes up and it helps even more."
SuicideWatch,f41raip,t1_f41nnii,1571322880.0,"I'm kind of that too. Sometimes just a random talk helps me to forget the situation I am in and keep moving. I think that even if situation doesn't get better, your brain still processes it somewhere on the background. Sometimes you start thinking about the situation differently and see the world differently. Maybe if you keep you brain occupied at present, you will get better eventually. What do you think?"
SuicideWatch,f41q7io,t1_f41mviv,1571322512.0,"It works in a sense that it keeps you busy, gives you purpose and eventually results. Self-motivation is a hard one. Usually you just start doing it as a robot and hope for motivation to come. Even if you fail, at least you tried and had experience, you know if it works for you and you can come back to it any time later. What do you think?"
SuicideWatch,f41k4yv,t1_f41gxzi,1571320379.0,Did you try listing the characteristics you need and trying to achieve it one by one? A kind of systematic approach to happiness
SuicideWatch,f41e278,t1_f41cfuy,1571318200.0,"I feel you, yeah. I think it's hard to live with people when you don't believe they love you. Do you have some ""hero""? I know it sounds stupid but maybe from a movie, someone you want to be like?

PS we all have our chores to do, don't be sorry for late reply"
SuicideWatch,f41d2jx,t1_f413xtp,1571317834.0,"Yeah, I understand. Though it's interesting that region also matters there, usually they try to make it country-wide. Maybe it is a part of a historical legacy with all the different tribes that Germany originated from.

Is there some sense of being a German in you? Patriotic feeling of some kind. Some people feel this way and they are kind of not alone, often they find similar-minded people"
SuicideWatch,f41cct7,t1_f412ag9,1571317571.0,I kind of understand. How do you usually cope with that? Maybe you read some books or got any advice?
SuicideWatch,f413jz3,t1_f4125hx,1571313871.0,I'm sorry it happenned to you *hugs*
SuicideWatch,f4125tm,t1_f410ikf,1571313137.0,"I mean just a general feeling. Like ""exe"" thing, ""nonexistant"", ""standby"". It's nor good nor bad, just interesting.

You told you need to finish A levels. What are these, I'm not familiar with your educational program"
SuicideWatch,f411kcy,t1_f410fpu,1571312781.0,"Can you tell about yourself, what do you do? Studying, maybe working?"
SuicideWatch,f411ezp,t3_dj4v1b,1571312690.0,Happy birthday to you! Are you going to have anything special today?
SuicideWatch,f411ala,t3_dj4xab,1571312618.0,Hi. You tried many things and you seem exhausted trying. Do you still have anything on your mind? You seem as a survivor type
SuicideWatch,f410eqm,t3_dj4xdo,1571312094.0,Hey. So what was the original reason? I'm sorry no one was around at that time.
SuicideWatch,f4108dw,t3_dj51jk,1571311987.0,This is hard to believe. Are you telling the truth?
SuicideWatch,f41015p,t1_f40zbpj,1571311861.0,Their motivation might not be as important though. You can always take some love from them and give some in return
SuicideWatch,f40z6h2,t3_dj4ctf,1571311343.0,I love you
SuicideWatch,f40ym0q,t1_f40y2hs,1571310993.0,Still programming even if it's visual. You talk in programming terms though. That is interesting.
SuicideWatch,f40ygso,t3_dj4ma1,1571310899.0,Hi. How long do you take meds? Does it help?
SuicideWatch,f40ycyb,t3_dj4n1i,1571310833.0,"Hey. I usually felt just numb, emotionless. Does it frighten you so much or is it something you can't control and it just happens?"
SuicideWatch,f40y19b,t3_dj1nzk,1571310625.0,"Hi. Can you tell about your life a bit, what do you do? Do you think about leaving your family house any time soon?"
SuicideWatch,f40xpvy,t3_dj4nrp,1571310420.0,And what is you average day like?
SuicideWatch,f40xk38,t3_dj4qpo,1571310319.0,"Hi. It seems that you wanted some love, this is probably why you told about your attempt. You said that a lot of people are concerned about you. Do they give you some love and kindness?"
SuicideWatch,f40xa6t,t3_dj4a9y,1571310135.0,Hey. You talk in terms of God but you said you are not a religious person. So do you still believe in God or is this just a comfortable way of understanding the world around you?
SuicideWatch,f40x17x,t3_dj4auc,1571309972.0,Hey. Are you a programmer?
occult,ev95q06,t1_eurrvzz,1564307525.0,"Subverting expectations, this is the thing right now, right? You have just masterfully executed it"
occult,eurp0ui,t3_ch26ry,1563997017.0,"Oh you so cool, you have the staff and crystal ball and long sleeve hoodie with a cape. Do you have beard irl? Kind of stereotype but beard rocks when it comes to wizardry and stuff"
