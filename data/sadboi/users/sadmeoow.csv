I dont remember my childhood, nor school years, only small fragments of it. It feels like I am stuck somewhere, where I am here but not really, everything is automatic. These days I dont really do anything, I used to draw, and do other creative things, but slowly I stopped doing them. I dont know why, but it feels like I have neve done them before. The weirdest thing what keeps happening since last year is when my brain questions if something really happened. I know it did, but did it? My memory is bad, and I cant learn anything new. My family probably thinks I am doing this on purpose, just because they dont experience it. Tried therapy, did not work, the therapist just kept going on about how I am just making up excuses, and I need to go out more and be social. And if I know what I am supposed to do why am I not doing it. Because I have no motivation, I dont know how to. Was referred to another doc to get meds, but couldn't go because of the virus. Or maybe because I am not meant for more in this life."
