U can also install Meetup app, find meetups that suits your needs/interests. 

Remember when you are in front of a staircase, u take 1 step at 1 time, u don't stretch your legs trying to get to the top in 1 step. Maybe writing them down can sort your priorities. 
Example:
1. Start therapy
2. Meet new people
3. Catch up with old friends, apologize, hang out again
Hopefully this can make u stop being attracted to married man (i'm saying this in a most non derogatory way possible).
