I've never had an issue when I've needed to call for something, they are always friendly and helpful. I do have issues sometimes in the stores, but I don't go on there often. I stick to phone or online service. Verizon might not be the cheapest, but you get what you pay for."

povertyfinance,fmem9w5,t3_fuoxeh,1586008168.0,"Do not be ashamed, you aren't alone! I broke down and filed this past July, also because of bad financial decisions. I was terrible with my money throughout my twenties, and desperately tried to fix it for years until I just couldn't keep up anymore. It was the best financial decision I've ever made. I no longer have any credit cards, so I'm very careful how I spend my money now because I don't have the safety net of a credit card. My credit score somehow did not tank as badly as I expected; it's back to 704 six months after my bankruptcy discharge. Take this as a learning experience and fresh start!"
Anxiety,flzcvnt,t3_frslfn,1585620707.0,"All. The. Time. Right now I'm working from home, haven't seen any of my coworkers in a month but we communicate through text... and I'm convinced they all hate me, which makes me nervous to actually go back to work, whenever that will be. Silly, I know but... This quarantine shit is really dragging me down to very dark places."
lonely,ffyr8i8,t3_evotox,1580353171.0,"I talk, hoping to have a conversation and maybe not feel so lonely - but no one listens. I'm constantly ignored even when I'm the only person trying to talk. Which makes me feel even lonelier and makes me want to fucking give up on everything. Why bother wasting my breath when no one listens?"
askcarsales,fff7tm6,t3_et57sd,1579877882.0,"Very informative... this must be why the people at the dealership were super nice to me when I came in to buy a CPO, until I told them I had my own financing, no trade, and didn't want the extra warranty or add-ons.  They were kinda rude after that and seemed to be trying to get me out the door faster. I'm assuming it's because they weren't going to make a profit off my sale."
AmItheAsshole,ff4hg8s,t1_ff4635t,1579563702.0,I'm still salty that Myspace made so many changes that ended up deleting the first messages between my now-husband and I from 2007. I should have printed them out when I had the chance... I get so upset knowing those early memories are gone forever!
obgyn,feng68y,t1_fene9e6,1579283981.0,"My hysterectomy was completely my choice. I had large fibroids and my periods were heavy, painful, and debilitating. I was given the option and jumped at the chance, no regrets. The hormonal symptoms have greatly decreased since I stopped eating sugar - I notice a huge shift in my mood and thoughts if I start eating junk again."
obgyn,felvavq,t3_epsbbp,1579231822.0,"Getting rid of your uterus won't help. I have the same mood swings and suicidal thoughts every month like clockwork even though I had a partial hysterectomy 3 years ago. They took my uterus, cervix, and fallopian tubes but left my ovaries - and my raging bitch hormones that make me want to hurl myself off a bridge stuck around too.  I don't know how to help you, but please know you aren't alone. Good luck!"

I mean, it's still gas station food but the cannoli is good and French toast stix are actual French toast - not some deep fried abomination."
obgyn,fct59th,t1_fct3itq,1577933229.0,"I had extremely heavy periods like this, and they were painful and honestly, super inconvenient at work. I would dehydrate myself so that I wouldn't have to stand up from my desk too often, and I had to wear compression shorts under my pants as an additional layer for the constant leaks. I was finally diagnosed with uterine fibroids and had the option of uterine ablation or a hysterectomy. I opted for the hysterectomy because I was so over periods.

I would ask for an ultrasound to look for fibroids. Hope you find some relief soon!"

MechanicAdvice,eynez0z,t1_eymslz4,1567245261.0,I'd say 90% of the miles on this car are highway miles. I commute 100 miles round trip for work every day. So it makes sense that the clutch hasn't seen as much wear as it could have.
