Having been in a similar situation, I know it seems there isn't a lot you can do to help the situation, at least not directly. However, as you live in the US, I would recommend you contact ChildHelp, which is a charity organization that helps young people who are living with abuse. Here's a link to their site:
https://www.childhelp.org/childhelp-hotline/

You can call, text or chat with them on their website. They are professional counselors who are trained in helping young people who are experiencing abuse. They can help you talk things through, and perhaps redirect you to additional sources, and help you figure out what to do next. Additionally, it's confidential, so they won't know who you are unless you tell them, however they usually only need to know that if you are in immediate danger.

I'm sorry there isn't a whole lot I can advise you to do, other than this, from sheer bitter experience. But I hope that this might help you somewhat. Know that you are not alone, and that you can get through this.
Take care."
unpopularopinion,fqswzcp,t1_fqrnvn4,1589621929.0,"Like I said, It's a really tricky question, because I realize that my logic falls apart very quickly. Regardless of function or how essential, I am wishing to remove healthy tissue from my body, which isn't providing me any discomfort, other than mentally.  And surely that's how people with BIID and other related disorders feel?

The question of whether we as a species really need more of us, is a relevant, but also different topic. Still, our purpose is to reproduce, and while I don't think I will ever need to bear children (god forbid), surely removing reproductive organs counts as disabling my body?

In the end, like you've already stated, I'm trying to justify my own feelings, while denouncing how someone else might feel, despite the two being very similar, if not nearly identical. I can only speak for myself, and I don't think I could ever come up with one definitive answer that in the end wouldn't be hypocritical in some way.I have an appointment with my gender therapist in about two weeks. She knows a lot more about the subject than the both of us combined, I believe. I'll remember to bring this question up to her.

Body Integrity Identity Disorder is a condition characterized by an intense desire to be disabled, usually in the form of removing limbs or eyes, like in your example. Another is Somatoparaphrenia, where a person is convinced one of their limbs doesn't belong to them. I don't know about any cases where people have wished to get rid of organs though, like lungs.

Both of these conditions have been compared to gender dysphoria, whether they should be considered as human diversity, or mental disorders. In fact, being transgender was only removed as a mental disorder in 2017.

Now, again, I think we need to be careful drawing conclusions about stuff we don't know much about, and I certainly don't understand people who wish to get rid of limbs and such. I've never experienced that thought process. But if I had to guess, to answer your question, I'd say the line is drawn at the point where altering your body becomes a disability, regardless of whether you actually want to become disabled, or have just become convinced our leg doesn't belong where it is. I think removing healthy extremities and organs would be considered as such.
You could perhaps argue that breast tissue counts as removing a healthy body part, but I don't think it serves the same grade of purpose as a limb or, well, an organ necessary for survival and day to day function, like a lung or eye.

""Would you encourage them to remove it?""
No. I wouldn't recommend someone to remove a healthy eye or leg. For that matter, I wouldn't recommend another transgender person to get surgery, even though the latter is actually an option at this point in time.
The two are similar in some ways, but definitely different in other key points, and I think there's a reason why one is generally accepted in this day and age, and the other isn't."

At the same time, and I say this with no ill intentions; I don't think you really have a say in what might make someone happy or not. Nor do I, of course. I can only say what makes one transgender person happy, and that person is me. I have never been happier/more at peace with myself, than since I started taking testosterone. The changes are still small at this point, but it means the world to me, that the way I feel finally matches reality, at least just a bit. And I cannot wait for later this year, when I will have my first appointment preparing for top surgery, when I can finally breathe normally and not feel uncomfortable. It's not mutilation.

Dogs, like people, have ways of telling your that they don't like what you're doing, and they will defend themselves. I'm all for children needing to learn to treat animals with respect. But I can't imagine a 7 year old being able to do something to cause a near fatal attack, the way you described it.  
I know that humans and dogs are different, but no sane person would ever nearly kill a child just because they were annoyed with them.

Advice,fhgr8ju,t3_f35npb,1581575930.0,"Hello there 👋
First, I'd like to reassure you that it is okay to be concerned about the current state of affairs. It is also important to stay vigilant. Good on you.
Now of course, I don't know where you live, but considering that it is February and kind of cold at the moment, it is very likely you just caught your everyday cold/flu/bronchitis. I even have one coming. 
So I'll take a quick guess and say that it is unlikely that you have been infected with the Corona virus. Someone who lives an hour away is unlikely to infect you, so there would have to be many people and circumstances connecting you. In which case, other people would probably start to show signs of the virus, and you'd soon know if there was a breakout in your area. 
 BUT LET ME REMIND YOU THIS IS JUST SPECULATION. Even if you have the virus, describing yourself as a young and healthy person is a good thing. The people who have died from the virus as of now, were people with compromised immune systems.
So, my advice to you is, that if you have concerns about your health, please go see a doctor. Your doctor will be able to help you if it is pneumonia or a cold, but don't be afraid to voice your concerns about the Corona virus. Your doctor will know if other people in your area have been reported with the virus, and will be able to act accordingly. But let me stress once again, that it is most likely just an ordinary case of pnemonia. 
I hope all goes well, take care."

unpopularopinion,fhdry0c,t3_f2m5xq,1581498583.0,"I agree that parents should at least attempt to calm their child, especially if we're talking temper tantrums, where kids cry because they're not allowed a toy or something. Nothing makes me cringe more than a kid lying on the floor of a supermarket because they were denied chocolate. 
But some (if not most) kids are just irrational to some extent, in their first few years of life, and there isn't a whole lot to be done about that. My 1.5 year old niece started screaming at me because she was in the process of eating a box of matches, and I took it away from her. That is irrational, because she doesn't understand the danger/effect of what she is doing. But there was nothing I could do to make her stop crying, no amount of timeout in the car or the bathroom. 
Every kid is different. I myself was a very quiet child, perhaps you just were too."
unpopularopinion,fhdrise,t3_f2m9c7,1581497986.0,"This truly is an unpopular opinion, so kudos for that. In the nature of an unpopular opinion, it is also a very touchy subject. I don't know much about birth rate in the US or how regulations would be made etc. But I do know a woman in my extended family who has given birth to five children, has neglected all of them, and they have all been taken away from her within their first year of life. She is pregnant with her 6th child, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. It is a financial burden, and eats away at the already understaffed social workers in my area."

unpopularopinion,fhdqcfc,t3_f2nqd1,1581496350.0,"I'm guessing you mean ""anything that doesn't hurt other people directly, but gladly where I can't see it"". As an example, many of the drugs people use in the western world come from overseas. People risk their lives trying to smuggle drugs into other countries. Additionally, if a dealer messes up something, or something goes wrong in general, they are more often than not killed of they fail to make up for it. So even if you're just using drugs yourself, you are supporting an industry that is extremely dangerous for other people."

Every day people die from air pollution, starvation because there isn't enough food, extreme weather conditions brought on by climate change. These days, because of population density, and currently we've got a virus spreading as quickly as the Australian wildfires, although the virus is pretty harmless atm.
However, this thinning of the crowd is coming too late. It is a result of the problem, not the solution."

1. It had no straps, and would fall down contantly.
2. It absolutely bended my ribs. To this day I still have a small dent around m ribcage.

A binder is, in my experience, one of those things that are worth spending a bit extra on, especially if you have several years to go before you can get top surgery."
AskReddit,fgxh581,t3_f0q5kc,1581172801.0,"I have Asperger's Syndrome. I was diagnosed fairly late, at age 16.  
My dad always treated me well, he's the best, honestly. He tells me that other than being very quiet and withdrawn (rarely crying except when mealtimes changed, or if a stranger touched me, or if someone made a loud noise), I was absolutely fine.

My stepmom however, didn't feel the same. She hated that I was so quiet, and thought it was because I didn't like her, which she later caused on her own anyway.   
If I didn't understand what she told me indirectly, or if I didn't just automatically knew what to say or do, she would throw a fit and call me names, degrade me. When I didn't like her touching me, she also took offence. 

So I guess I've experienced both good and bad reactions."

My mom moved out when I was 2, so in that way despite not really being there for me or having any impact on my life what so ever, she did leave a mark."

Also, if it's not too much to ask, could the package have some proper mods next time around? Like, people who are nice and know what they're doing?"

He really liked water. I think he should have been a sealion or something. We spent many summer hours at beaches.
Also, despite his black coat, he could always be found in a sunny spot somewhere.
When he was about two years old, he ran away with the neighbor's dog, but where the neighbor's dog would continue across the field for several miles, Rasmus stopped at the edge of the road for some reason, turned around, and went straight back to his bowl.
If you sat on the floor, he had a thing with sitting on you. Not next to you, but on you. I guess he wanted to make sure you weren't going anywhere.

Thank you for showing interest in my old man, he really was a good boy."
