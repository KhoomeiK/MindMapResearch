In NJ we dont get the kind of snow you guys get but it holds its own in inclement weather. And if you want to learn how to work on cars its a great start. Did my alternator, spark plugs, oil, brakes, and serpentine belt in my front yard and family’s gas station. Room for the driver is great, not so much for rear passengers. I have 2400 watt subs in mine and the sound quality is phenomenal. It is FWD unfortunately but its better than RWD in the snow. If you snag the 6 speed manual one youll be able to keep up with modern v6 stangs and camaros if you race them right."

Buy

Used

Either auto or manual suits fine. Auto preferred for comfort though

Coupe/Sedan

Must haves: 2014 or newer, below 90k miles, 6 speed or greater, some aftermarket support, and RWD or AWD

Cars considered: Rc 350, ATS Coupe, A5/S5, G8 GT

Can do minor work and maintenance on cars

Additional notes: Im 19 years old going on 20 so i want to get something sleek and decently quick without breaking the bank on insurance or getting into the unreliable side of things. Im making about 2k a month rn and am uncertain what my college future looks like next year due to  covid so my budget may increase to 25k considering. Id like to buy a car that wont depreciate in value just by sitting which is why audis are my first choice but they got a lot of what im looking for. The rc350 is at the top of my list but i dont like the idea of spending 25k or more on a car that performs in the same range as a v6 camaro/mustang. However i am open to modifying any car i get in the future. As for sedans, i love the g8 gt but cant find many that are reasonably priced according to mileage. I was originally planning on getting one but the interior amenities are lacking"
