stimuluscheck,fr3s45u,t1_fr21l74,1589864759.0,I got a lovely letter today about offset due to back child support... So in a way I got it by being told I wasn’t getting it.
stimuluscheck,fr1q7jc,t1_fr0yus7,1589824085.0,What’s their #?
stimuluscheck,fr0zigu,t1_fr0yhzb,1589810241.0,"It won’t pass as long as we have people like my ex voting for trump (selfish, entitled, greedy assholes who live to make their lives easier while others harder). I shouldn’t owe a dime in back support but he’s such a grifter he found a way to make it possible"
stimuluscheck,fr0ymgd,t3_gm17hj,1589809707.0,Yeah I read that and I hope so. I not only provide for our child at his house at a whopping tune of over $800 a month I also provide our child’s medical insurance and daycare costs and I have her 1/2 the time. He’s such a f****** conman
stimuluscheck,fr0yhdm,t3_gm17hj,1589809623.0,But it does have the ddd of 4/29 they gave me lol so they must have direct deposited it into my exes account 😒 bc he’s the master manipulator who could make the same child support agent that was enforcing his child support turn around and enforce me to pay 8 times the amount he was (bc he’s a wonderful conman).
stimuluscheck,fr0yb6n,t1_fr0y7zx,1589809518.0,Middle isn’t anything to do with it but if you look closely at the bottom one it says things like offset and shit. I don’t think there’s a stimulus in there
stimuluscheck,fr0whpj,t3_gm17hj,1589808357.0,I just zoomed in and it says we’ve offset... damn apparently even those compliant with child support won’t get a check
stimuluscheck,fr0vumx,t3_gm17hj,1589807938.0,Only reason I’m asking is there are two letters and my dad date was over three weeks ago and I still have online DDD of 4/29 and I supposedly owe back support which his a bunch of bs for a different story.
stimuluscheck,fr0vhvx,t1_fr0vfbo,1589807708.0,Click the pic there are two from the treasury
stimuluscheck,fqoki09,t1_fqm9anc,1589517377.0,I have a date of 4/29/2020 and it never came and it was never deposited in my account or attempted to be deposited. They took that shit for some past due debt
medical_advice,fqlwxtq,t1_fq8lkdq,1589467582.0,True but I tested negative twice. So I’m wondering if this is another form of covid we caught?
stimuluscheck,fqlwkn4,t1_fqjw3gq,1589467394.0,Same I never got one and I clearly qualified
stimuluscheck,fq876j2,t1_fq4zq4v,1589159887.0,"Everything should have been 100% correct on mine. As I stated In my comment, my bank stated there was no pending payments and no attempt at an IRS payment on my bank account. So essentially I’m in limbo. Can’t check my banking info again and waiting on the letter that will never arrive."
medical_advice,fq86woc,t1_fq7kc2i,1589159727.0,So I just got over pneumonia that was resistant to 3 different antibiotics and I have these ALL OVER my knees. Is that the connection?
stimuluscheck,fq565ji,t1_fq564id,1589093771.0,I see what you did there 🥁 haha
stimuluscheck,fq4qcdc,t1_fq49ucw,1589081718.0,"You do realize without this pandemic, it would be business as usual right? 😒"
stimuluscheck,fq4qayj,t1_fq49ucw,1589081693.0,Yes gratitude pays the bills during a pandemic. I fOrGoT
stimuluscheck,fq4pvwl,t1_fq4pt6r,1589081428.0,Mine still says April 29. Checked tonight. It still says to ask my bank and they say it was never attempted (irs never attempted to deposit it)
Scams,fq3rvju,t3_gfnrc7,1589069466.0,"So I noticed some things have changed. He’s saying he needs the other kidney out? Wouldn’t that mean he has NO kidneys? This due saw an opportunity and took it. I bet 100% he said “I’ll donate my kidney so they can find my kidney cancer and my good deed will help me raise $$ for costs”. Like we spoke about, he probably had it before he made it out there, knew about it and decided that no one would pay for his treatments without a hero story thrown in the mix. That’s why he decided to call. He knew he was sick, he knew he couldn’t afford treatment, and he knew a go fund me with no story behind it would raise a thing. So he offered to donate a kidney to your sister and act surprised about when they found something (doubtful its stage 4, I really hope his doctors catch him in this lie) and so he could seem like a hero and get ppl to pay for his treatments. I really wish you the best OP and hope your mom figures this out soon!"
stimuluscheck,fq3pfrx,t3_ggmo2j,1589068728.0,"I still haven’t seen mine but congrats!

Edit to add I’m in NC and had a DD date of 4/29. Irs lied"

stimuluscheck,fpfgz42,t1_fpdp8uq,1588570952.0,"Same. If it’s not here by Tuesday I’m just gonna say f it and figure the treasury seized it (and what’s worse is it won’t go to back child support, the treasury seizes it and keeps it to pay out less). F*ck!ng cares act cares nothing about the people."
tifu,fpfgu3c,t3_gcuil8,1588570833.0,This is gold 😻😂
stimuluscheck,fpdlc1b,t1_fpdg46y,1588529251.0,I’m still employed full time but my base pay is crap and my job has done little to compensate for the loss in sales because they firmly believe we can still make commission off of a global crisis. My ex is vindictive and spiteful that’s for a whole different conversation lol. I really hope it was a banking error and I get one in the mail. I’m getting discouraged to say the least.
stimuluscheck,fpdl3x3,t1_fpdl1xh,1588529123.0,My bank claims to know nothing
stimuluscheck,fpddn29,t1_fpdcxcu,1588524926.0,I have no sign of pending deposits and I have asked my bank who claims they know nothing (chase) I’m stressing because I work in sales to small and medium businesses and as you can imagine they are all closed dropping my commission down by thousands of dollars to almost nothing
stimuluscheck,fpdc6bj,t1_fpdc1au,1588524101.0,"I wasn’t using it to cover a lawyer right now I was using it to pay bills to put aside $$ for a lawyer. I make commission every month and if I could get two or three months ahead on bills I could have the $3k retainer by the time this is over. It’s along story but if the treasury has it that you owe back support they seize it. Read the CARES act, it’s trash"
stimuluscheck,fpdby39,t1_fpdblat,1588523970.0,"Bc they dont have a handle on the system. It knows only a couple prompts and I doubt it knows “you owe this or that therefore we aren’t paying you, it’s going tj be seized”"
stimuluscheck,fpdbmhg,t1_fpdb12t,1588523788.0,"I supposedly owe back support that I argued and pulled a motion to audit (Ex is being skeevy and deceiving) and I did that about a week before shut down, so I’m wondering if he got it and I didn’t. I’m so pissed. I need this $$ bc I pay $800+ a month in child support as is and my ex shouldn’t get this, I’m a single mom who has her child 50% of the time and I was saving up to pay for a lawyer. Frustrating"
stimuluscheck,fpd8qt5,t1_fpd7vyx,1588522147.0,How did you double check it? I just get that message you saw on my post but no ability to check if it’s correct
stimuluscheck,fpd8m7t,t1_fpd8a8i,1588522072.0,Did you owe child support or anything else that could have prevented you from getting the stimulus?
stimuluscheck,fpd766p,t1_fp16wqy,1588521239.0,So I should chalk it up that I’m not getting one bc my date was 4/29 and I have chase and haven’t seen shit

SuicideWatch,foxi5d5,t1_foui22o,1588144726.0,"Fun fact, I’m actually allergic to pet dander. So I tried to get as short hair of a dog I could find and some how ended up with a white pit bull French bulldog, definitely not what I was going for. Being around dogs with long hair makes me swell in my eyes and nose. I have to bathe him once a week and vacuum constantly but it hasn’t been too bad. I am in sales and that has been stressful given small and medium businesses are closed. I love my job and I have wanted to look into something else but, money and allergies lol. Plus fear of the unknown/no degree. So for now I’ll keep working from home with this adorable life saver and enjoy it 🖤."
ADHD,fou97p4,t3_g9crap,1588079309.0,I never finished college because of ADHD. Maybe this is a sign I should try again? Congrats!!
SuicideWatch,fou66ew,t3_g9loxa,1588077240.0,"Thank you! I am too. I think the mix of having to take care of someone other than myself all the time, being forced to see the sun and take him on long walks has been the most helpful. Actually getting out of the house and in the sun, getting exercise, having a companion has kept me from getting more depressed and offing myself. I’ve struggled with Adhd my whole life which causes stress, anxiety, and subsequent suicidal ideation and attempts."
