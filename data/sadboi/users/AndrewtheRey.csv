This is due to the fact that their ancestors were enslaved in the south, which had at one point, a very unified culture, largely influenced by the blacks that lived there. During the great migration, many blacks held on to their culture and therefore it was passed on through the generations. The generation who’s parents or themselves left the south during those times is largely very old now, but most blacks have family ties to those states and some still stay in contact with their cousins in the south or in other states.
