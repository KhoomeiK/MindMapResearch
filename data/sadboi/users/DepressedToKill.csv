> It all comes back to how precisely BCS navigates the question of what people do and why they do it, and whether why they do things should affect our willingness to label them as good or bad.

Maybe he was right about Jimmy, but I don’t think that really excuses his spiteful actions to destroy his own brother.

By thinking that Jimmy could never change, his actions likely led Jimmy towards a self-fulfilling prophecy, although that is left open to interpretation. He may have continued in his ways even with Chuck’s continuing support, but I like to think that’s not the case. I think Jimmy was a good guy deep down, but Chuck really brought out the evil within him just to spare himself from envy."

> According to the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (the DC:0-3R), which was published in 2005 by a non-profit organization called Zero to Three, the following five conditions should be met in order for a diagnosis of depression [by a mental health professional] to be made in an infant:

> The emotional and behavioral pattern must represent a change from what is typical for the child.

> A depressed or irritable mood must be present every day, for most of the day, over a period of two weeks.

> The depressed symptoms should occur in more than one activity and within more than one relationship.

> The symptoms must cause the child distress, impair their functioning, and/or impede their development.

> The symptoms must not be due to a general medical condition, a medication, or an environmental toxin.

So it’s basically the same as how everyone else is diagnosed, but obviously much harder and more open to interpretation with an infant that can’t speak."

Troubled relationships

A lack of empathy (inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others)
