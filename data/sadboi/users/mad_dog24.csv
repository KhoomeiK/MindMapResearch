Most careers in the public health field are in the public sector (government, community health orgs, non-profts) It doesn’t mean you CANT make money, like some epidemiologists and biostatisticians can make a lot.

If you wanna stay in public health major, make sure you take a lot of research, stats and programming classes. Also learn statistical programs like R, SAS, or Stata. Those will at least be transferable to most jobs and it’s high demand and higher pay. And you can still work in the healthcare setting. 

But yeah, if you wanna make money, public health shouldn’t be the first thing that pops into your head unfortunately.

But you shouldn’t feel guilty about wanting money. We all want to be at least comfortable and be able to do things. I think that’s a concern most people have! You’re okay!"

You go your whole life thinking that no one can tell you what to do, it doesn’t matter what others think, you’re your own person. It’s all true, but when you add a partner to the mix, you have to differentiate between changing your communication style, and changing your personality. Those are two totally different things.

You not texting back after 3 days for no reason isn’t a personality trait. You not remembering your partners birthday isn’t a personality trait. Your tendency to lie and cheat is NOT a personality trait! You’re just an asshole."

The nasty tone of it all makes me think it’s all coming out of jealousy and selfishness on their part, and maybe it’s been going on for a long time and it took something like this to set them off.

Are you very young to get married at this day in age? Maybe. But it’s not uncommon either, and when you know, you know, right? If their concerns came from a more sensible place, like if your bf was actually a complete jerk, then maybe that would have made sense. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. 

There’s some friends you keep for life. And there’s some you outgrow. You definitely outgrew these two. I’m sure it’s not easy letting them go. Maybe you’ll rekindle in the future, who knows. But they definitely showed their true colors here and I’m glad you cut them off for now."

running,fo6ke9y,t3_g5p983,1587560975.0,"I’ve found that exercise in general is so great for mental health, both in the short term and the long term. What I mean to say is that when I’m running, I’m not thinking about what’s making me anxious because it’s too hard to do both at the same time. The exercise literally forces my brain to focus on my body movements and my breathing rather than my anxiety. It feels so good to get a break from the constant cycle of thoughts while also getting outside and looking at the scenery.

Long term, I find I have more energy, and with each passing day, each exercise gets easier and easier to do. Feeling like I can do anything instead of feeling like a blob, is the best feeling.

That being said I actually enjoy tracking my runs, because I have goals I want to work towards and when I reach those goals I know I’ve made progress and I can be proud of myself.

There’s no arguments, no negativity, there’s just pure happiness and the thrill of being with someone who makes you feel good. We also didn’t tell anyone for a while so the sneaking around was kinda fun.

I’ve been with my bf for almost 5 years. I haven’t had that feeling since maybe 6 months into the relationship. The relationship took a slightly dark turn after that, I’m not gonna lie. But we learned so much about each other and came out stronger than ever before. I don’t even wanna go back to the beginning because we made such amazing progress as a couple. Plus I have a few more thrills to look forward too (moving in together, getting a dog, getting married, etc.). 

So to get to the point, that specific feeling may go away but the bond and trust are so much stronger and make you feel secure and safe when you’re with the right person."

I honestly don’t believe we are just going to be locked up like we are now for 3 extra months. I can see that for one month but not 3. Like, forget about individual people, but our economy literally will collapse if we go through an entire summer exactly like this.

AND because Ohio is doing such a great job compared to some other states, we might not be in this for as long either. The lockdowns are just projections and precautions. We always want to prepare for the worst, but in my personal opinion, I don’t think the worst is going to come. At least not for us.

Anxiety,fm30ghz,t1_fm2nzph,1585709769.0,"Yes absolutely! My bf and I have been together almost 5 years but I still live with my parents and he just got his own place. We were planning to look at apartments together next year. Anyway the last time I saw him in person was march 21st, and we agreed not to see each other until social distancing is lifted. Well now that just got extended through April 30th (in the US). But every day I count down the days till May 1st. Even if May 1st might not be the day, at least it will be closer until I can see him again.

The reason why I don’t see him isn’t because he’s a healthcare worker or anything, but he visits his parents pretty often (his parents still go to work every day) and I don’t want to give anything to his parents and he doesn’t want to give anything to mine through us two hanging out together. I would rather just be on the safe side and do everything in my power to contain the virus as much as possible. Because through just me I could infect so many people if I’m not careful.

It’s hard. And it sucks. Every day I tell him I wish I was with him and he says he misses me. But there IS an end to this. So we both talk about what we’re going to do together once this is all over and it helps a little. Keeping myself really busy with hobbies helps too. I’m doing a paint by numbers and it’s very therapeutic. It still sucks but every day we get closer to the end of all this. And that’s what keeps me from going completely insane."

We hate to fail, and when we fail over and over and over again, giving up sounds like the only option, because how the hell do we find the strength to start again when we’ve failed so many times? It’s all too much work! In the meantime we criticize ourselves, call ourselves losers and quitters. Food is the only thing that can make that pain go away for just a little bit. We just don’t want to put the work in anymore because we don’t think we can do it and it’s all too much.

Let those feelings out! Let out your frustrations! Losing weight is HARD. Changing your habits is HARD. It’s annoying as hell, and you have every right to be frustrated. Especially now with everything going on.

Now, I will say the anxiety is somewhat more manageable, and I’ve found that making phone calls before I’ve had the chance to think about them works the best.

The whole point is, anxiety disorders are a chronic condition. Yes it may get better over time , it may be almost non-existent after treatment, who knows? But it’s always a part of you. And that’s what many people don’t get.

When I go to my local planet fitness I would watch family feud a lot too. It was something to look forward too and I get to play along with the contestants. Great distraction from the running! For a while at least."
dating_advice,fc8xakj,t3_eglc9q,1577543561.0,"Thanks for posting this. I know some people may confuse this with “if you don’t love yourself no one will love you” but it’s not the same thing.

You are always deserving of love no matter what, but, in my own opinion, if you want to love someone else completely, learn how to take care of yourself and practice some self-love.

It’s impossible to rely solely on one other person for your happiness. It puts so much pressure on both parties to do everything right all the time. And that never happens in a real relationship. 

But most importantly, be kind to yourself because you are going to be you for the rest of your life. And you should be comfortable with that or at least tolerate it. It’s not easy, but it’s worth it."
Anxiety,fc6k5qe,t3_egdenq,1577482507.0,"Yes. It doesn’t happen to me often, and it usually comes and goes in a day, but when it hits me, I feel like an absolute zombie. Sometimes I cry, sometimes I don’t. It depends on how much strength I have. But it’s a real out of body experience and I hate it."

Anxiety,fbu34y8,t3_eeg8v1,1577106586.0,"Your post has me thinking. I hate when people say “it’s the Internet, when you post, you’re going to get mean comments, get over it.”

It shouldn’t be the assumption that people are going to be mean and cruel. This behavior shouldn’t just be accepted. It’s wrong on all fronts. I get that so many people make terrible comments on the internet because it’s so easy and they’re no repercussions. I’m just saying it’s sad. And it’s just not right. I don’t care how common it is, it just isn’t right.

Insulting you didn’t make that commenter hotter, it just made him a terrible person."

I’m so glad you’re getting the help you need. I took the medication cabergoline for about a year to shrink my tumor and then my periods have been regular ever since!"
progresspics,f9ri2gm,t1_f9qx6lh,1575576631.0,Thanks! I definitely lost fat in the face before anything else. I still have ways to go (I also have stubborn belly fat haha) Happy to help motivate you! We can do this!
Fitness,f9pry3r,t3_e6eexj,1575547266.0,"At my planet fitness treadmill at least, it asks for my weight whenever I start my run. I’m 129 at the moment, and I burned around 300 calories in 30 minutes at mostly 5.6 mph (increasing speed to 6.2 near the end, no incline). The weight is automatically set to 165 lbs if you don’t set the weight yourself. A higher weight means higher calorie burn."

I had to talk through multiple experiences throughout my life that I avoided thinking about for so long. It’s not easy at all, but it gets so much better. You literally did the hardest part, and I have no idea who you are but I am very proud of you! You deserve to rest and relax!"

relationship_advice,f22p0rz,t3_dbji0s,1569893535.0,"All the comments saying “hit the gym” , nah. you really don’t have to go to a gym. 1. There’s plenty of ways to exercise without ever spending money on a gym membership and 2. Losing weight is mostly about diet.

I’m overweight and my boyfriend is skinnier but he’s cut and he looks so hot...he’s made so much more progress than me (we started working out together on New Years and have been ever since) and it makes me feel like I’m not doing enough. (Again, I stress that diet is more important than exercise for weight loss)

But any progress you make is progress. I lost 11 pounds so far after 9 months. That is not a lot of weight to many people, but I’ve never done that before in my life. I need to be proud of that. That is all me! I don’t look much different at all but I can move around easier than I could back in January, and I have more energy and less anxiety overall. 

BUT!!! You don’t have to change a thing about yourself if you don’t want to. This is about you and has nothing to do with your husband. Please try not to compare yourself to him especially because it seems like he cares about you a lot. He has his life journey. You have yours. No one is better than the other. I’m trying to learn this myself and it’s not easy. Please try to seek some therapy or counseling! It helped me out a lot!!"
