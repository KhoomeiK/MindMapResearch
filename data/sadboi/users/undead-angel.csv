GriefSupport,fc5pjod,t3_eg913u,1577463234.0,"i feel this too :( i [19f] lost my dad [52m] suddenly and unexpectedly on nov 20. i feel so alone. my friends say they‚Äôre there for me but are they really? i know it‚Äôs the holidays and people are busy with family but nobody messages or asks to hang out. the only influx of messages i got were after i made a public post announcing his death abt 2 weeks ago (3 wks after he died) so i wouldn‚Äôt need to tell people one by one. and ik some people don‚Äôt know how to deal with or react to this sorta thing bc they‚Äôve never gone thru it but some people i considered my BEST friends (college ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù that i live in an apartment with) NEVER messaged me ONCE. i‚Äôm trying to justify it in my head but i don‚Äôt know if i want to be friends with them anymore. sadly, i will live with the 3 of them (only one of whom messaged me) for the next several months until our lease is up. i feel so let down by all the people in my life who i considered good or true friends. one of my hs guy friends (turned fwb this summer) asked if i wanted to ‚Äúhangout‚Äù aka fuck the day i got back home. i called him out for being insensitive and he apologized saying he thought maybe it would be a good distraction but realizes now that it was fucked up, but seriously, what the FUCK. why do some people have zero fucking brain cells?? the one person who understood me and loved me the most is gone forever. this is the lowest i‚Äôve ever felt. i don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôll get through this but i know i have to, for my dad, mom, and sisters. 
i just feel so alone :("
GriefSupport,fc5ng6g,t3_eg0744,1577462071.0,"i feel the exact same way. what your mother was to you, my father was to me. he died on 11/20, right before thanksgiving break, in another country, suddenly and unexpectedly. he was only 52, and i‚Äôm only 19. what am i supposed to do without him? i had to resign from my job (on the day i started bc it was the day after i found out) and take a leave of absence from school so i could go to the country where he died to be with my family and have the funeral. he loved, trusted, believed in, and understood me like no other. i was my fathers daughter while both my sisters were my moms daughters (aka i was closest to him while my sisters were closer to my mom). he would always defend me and have my back when i fought with my mom. there‚Äôs no one i loved more than my dad...i‚Äôm so utterly heartbroken now, i cry almost every day. and i‚Äôm really really scared of losing anyone else bc i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôd have the strength to go on. my entire rest of my family (mom, older sis, younger sis) all suffer from depression and/or anxiety and i‚Äôm terrified of losing them to suicide or sudden death. thanksgiving, christmas, new years...none of these holidays will ever be the same. my life is never going to be the same. i‚Äôm never going to be the same.
and his birthday (1/28) is the first day of school for me next semester. oh these last few months have been horrible, and these next few months will be too. i don‚Äôt really want to be alive anymore but i can‚Äôt do that to my dad, mom, or sisters, so i‚Äôm trying to be strong and put on a brave face as well. i just miss him so much.

sorry for this long comment and lack of advice, your post made me feel less alone seeing someone go through what i‚Äôm going through and i haven‚Äôt rly had anyone to talk to or a place to let out my feelings bc i hate being vulnerable in front of people that know me. wishing the best for you, and i hope we get through this and find happier days ‚ù§Ô∏è"
