Right now, the city is messing with the sewer around that spot and nearly took him out. Matt Groening went to Lincoln High School, Which is the school that’s being built. Portland public school was very adamant this was not damaged. In fact I’ve had several business owners and employees who work in the area say they’d personally get it sawcut on their own dime and placed in their sidewalk so it’s not far from the original spot."
