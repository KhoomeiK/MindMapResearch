French,fgdmlgs,t3_exohsx,1580684094.0,"I'd suggest a site called TV5MONDE ( [http://www.tv5monde.com/](http://www.tv5monde.com/)  ) . It has podcasts available, dictionaries, and lots of other stuff that mainly relate to contemporary news if you're into that sort of stuff. If not and you'd like an easier approach to the language, I'd suggest starting with and using apps like Duolingo or Memrise - however, using just one of these isnt going to help you fully learn the language. Duolingo is best used as a learner software alongside outside French learning, but it does its job relatively well. Good luck!"
