4.Yeah. I'm no woman, but I know that on dating apps they get flooded with so many messages. Hundreds of them. It sucks because, there's too many to go through and it's hard to pick one hoping it's trustworthy. Or so I think.

AskReddit,fqsfusa,t1_fqsdw2n,1589606140.0,"Are you Christian? I'm not, but if you are, the Bible answers your own question. First example I can think of is with Job. Satan challenged God's authority and said that his followers only believed in him because he helped them. He told God that Job only obeys him because of all of the good things/rewards God provided. He wanted to prove to God that if you take away the good things from Job that he would denounce God. And God accepted Satan's challenge. He let Satan take everything from Job to prove that even with nothing, Job would still love him and not denounce him. I don't remember what the outcome was. Then the second thing I can think of is In the new testament when someone talks about the last days. There has to be suffering for the last days to happen. I can't think of a single time in history where there wasn't suffering though. But yeah, the most faithful get the most brunt because they don't fit in with the rest of ""the world."" It's a common teaching in Christianity and a ""predictor"" of the last days before rapture/ Armageddon too. You're not supposed to fit in. If you did, you wouldn't feel persecuted. And persecution is a sign of the last days too. I personally don't believe in religion, but if you are a hardcore Christian, you're going to have to take my non-believing as well as others not believing as proof of the end times. Because non-believers/ blasphemers are also ""proof"" of end times getting closer. Evil happens because God wants you to know that that's what he's going to get rid of in paradise/heaven or wherever it is we go after we die. Atleast that's my understanding if I were religious. But I am not, so I don't think that way anymore but I used to. Hope that answers your question."
