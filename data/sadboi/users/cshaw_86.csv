The strongest evidence for the deleterious effects of cannabis on male reproductive capacity is its impact on semen parameters. Studies demonstrate reduced sperm count and concentration, morphological changes, reduced motility and viability, and decreased fertilizing capacity in animals and humans exposed to marijuana or cannabis derivatives. Furthermore, animal studies suggest that cannabis has a role in testicular atrophy. While cannabis may increase libido in the short term, chronic use may diminish erectile function in men."
