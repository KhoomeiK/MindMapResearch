Like oh, I logically understand you had a medical emergency and had no way to contact me, and emotionally this triggered thoughts and feelings of XYZ. 

OP, this 100% doesn‚Äôt mean you were wrong or invalid. It just means that you‚Äôve got some work to do and you are making progress. I applaud that you are going to therapy and I am so excited for you to explore this new and difficult side of yourself and learn more."

LifeProTips,feptfe9,t1_feof13j,1579330667.0,I usually tell myself they have to poop really bad. It‚Äôs both funny and relatable.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fefwu8e,t1_fe8ofey,1579067813.0,"I eventually was able to, but only because something finally clicked that it had nothing to do with me, if that makes sense? Like I Harbor no ill will to them, but I‚Äôll never trust them again and I‚Äôd be on high alert around them. Sometimes it pops back into my head and I feel sort of sick about it, but it‚Äôs passing quicker and quicker now. 

If you feel therapy would help you, I would recommend going! During my bad breakup I was not going to therapy, but I have been since and my life is a lot different. It‚Äôs at least someone on the outside looking in with a different perspective. 

It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre detoxing from a drug. They were there and your brain started relying on them for serotonin and dopamine and all that and it all just got ripped away. It‚Äôs HARD."
MadeMeSmile,fe6r5y0,t1_fe5fzs6,1578901507.0,You‚Äôre a really good person. Thank you for being so kind!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fe6q84h,t1_fe3390b,1578900304.0,"I don‚Äôt know if this will help, but I‚Äôve had to go NC a few times. What helps me is I create a note in Google or the notes app, whatever. Every time I have something I want to say, I put it in the note. The urge gets less and less because I get no response and I‚Äôm slowly healing, but I‚Äôm also getting all those feelings and hurt and anger out. I wish you all the best and send you so much love. It‚Äôs hard as hell and I know you‚Äôre strong enough to do it."

Editing to add: You‚Äôre a Bojack Horseman and a James Clear fan too! Hell YES."
toastme,fcsn2io,t3_eijdzy,1577920102.0,"I am so proud of you!!! Please continue your regular check-ups and fight for your health! Get a good primary who will recognize and change your healthcare plan based on this history, not a lazy POS like the one my mom has. Also, keep a relationship with a great oncologist, just in case and for regular check-ups. You are amazing and strong and I AM SO FUCKING HAPPY FOR YOU!!!"
