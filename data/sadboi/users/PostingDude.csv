WritingPrompts,fdzq0h2,t3_en5clh,1578793158.0," I love sleepovers. Thats not the most manly thought but getting together with the boys and talking about dumb teen stuff is the fucking best. I didn't have friends when i was younger and it was pretty crappy so I try to cherish the times shared with my new brosephs. And this weekend we have some great plans. Joe’s uncle is super chill with rules so were getting some drinks and just see where the night takes us. 

We like to hang out at brandon’s house because his house is closest to school so we can walk there after school pretty easy and it's next to the forest so we got space to hit baseballs as far as possible and not be seen by cops and adults that would do harm to our fun of fighting with sticks n shit. 

6 of us. Chilling over the weekend. Friday was awesome we found a cool chill spot in the forest and now it's saturday. Were in the forest. Jo took out a book bound in black leather and said he wanted us to try something. Brandon egging us on saying there's some really cool shit they've tried in the book. Apparently they tried to summon fire and they didn't get it all the way but their hands got hot and there was a burn mark in a tree. Everyone seems impressed and curious. Not me. I'm not into this stuff

“Guys we probably shouldn't be messing with LITERAL dark forces” I protest to them

“No no it's not dark it's just magic, its like natural. fire is nature, there's also plants spells and all sorts of stuff we could try” says joe

“For real this shit is beyond us i don't even know what to do”

“Haha well that's what the book is for dumbass”

Joe flips through some pages and holds the book toward me to read. SUMMON ETHEREAL GUIDE the title reads

Joe explains to the group that with this spell they can figure out and learn a lot within a short amount of time because the guide can teach you magically so you just know stuff instead of having to learn it. Everyone seems really excited about the pyrokinetics and eager to try this out.

Joe says stand in a circle and say the chant.

“No fuck this im not into this and neither should you guys this is not safe and yall need to stop. Now. please?” I plead as they gather up

Nope not me i'm never going to stand in that circle

“C'mon it says we need 6 people” they plead back

“Whatever we can just do it with 5 its fine. If he wants to be a pussy without fire then let him” joe says. They all nod or shrug me off.

So they push me aside, circle up, and chant. Heads bowed, eyes closed. They keep chanting like that for about 30 seconds.

“See guys nothing is happening!”

They don't respond and keep chanting

“So you can stop now its not working, so you can stop!”

Ok now im worried, wouldn't they at least tell me to shut up? Shoot me a glare? I was right this has to stop right now before someone gets hurt in some spiritual way we couldn't even fathom. I rush to the circle and shake brandon

“Wake up!”

His eyes stay closed and his chant tone and volume even and consistent as before. I feel desperation seeping into my heart and reaching through my chest and toward my throat

“Shit what the actual fuck is happening”

It was like the desperation inside me heard my voice and strengthened with my confusion. The dank grip i felt inside me pulsed its influence further. Spreading into my muscles, I felt I could barely stand or move my arms. Their chanting became louder and with their increasing volume i felt increasingly weaker. Legs giving in, I collapsed into the center of the circle. I could barely breathe now and the chant was almost shouting. My eyelids were the last to fall. Darkness.

I woke up chained to a rock surrounded by brimstone. Fire surrounded me. I was confused

“Help! anyone please help me!”

To my surprise the fire was the one to respond. It reared toward me and fire tips didn’t flicker but directed themselves at me like snake heads posing for a strike. I felt the fire speaking. Not with words but more of a spiritual pressure of images and feelings in my mind and body. They showed me as a child. Outcast from my peers. They showed me i was desperate for attention, the people of my life that were supposed to love and care and their disregard. I saw my future as a sad pathetic person who out of the hatred of his heart denied everything in life because life had denied him from normalcy stability and love. I couldn't hold down a job, I could only keep friends temporarily by faking to be someone I never was. I never lived. The flames told me I was dead and banned from anything good in life. At first i cried. I don't know how but everything they told me was true. Even my future. And then the flames stopped my thoughts and said i no longer had a future. This was my death. This was purgatory. That was your one chance at life and it was total and utter failure. 

“No! That's not the end! It's not fair!”

As I screamed in protest to the truth of the flames they burned brightly and maintained this is the end. You are over. A deep primal scream was all I could do to reject this that i knew was true. I screamed and cried for what seemed like days in torture of the flames.

This unacceptable rage and anger inside was the only thing i felt anymore time was irrelevant it may have been months or it may have been decades when it happened. Seemingly out of nowhere. The red and fire turned dark and i experienced silence. Sweet calming silence. The red rage of the fires turned black. And a whisper swept from the air into my ear.

“It's not really over. You can be free to roam again.”

My skin tingled with every word the wind whispered

“Yes it's true, you have another chance. Sleep and rise my prince”

my chains melted into liquid and I fell to the floor. It was cool and peaceful. I fell asleep.

The first thing I felt was the wind. And my eyes opened. I was in the circle everyone around me with a concerned look pointed at me. Pain in my stomach I vomited. It was a blood and black tar like substance. My arms beneath me i saw my veins much darker than normal, and in that moment I remembered everything. Life had betrayed me. Everything the earth birthed was my fruitless demise.

“Are you ok?” I heard a familiar voice. Joe.

The rage I felt in the fires welled within. It was in my voice and in my arms as  I reached for Joe’s neck. 

“You never gave a shit about me.”

With inhuman strength i clamped and dug my fingers into his throat. I lifted him into the air and slammed him down onto a rock. His body lifeless immediately after impact. My former friends yelled and began to put distance between us.

“Not enough.”

One by one I chased and squashed them. I hated them. They were part of the world that was tainted by who I once was. The were part of the world at all. Anything consisting of life was next."

NoFap,f5phtgp,t1_f5pbyxp,1572359712.0,lmao good idea
NoFap,f5pbv88,t1_f5pa9qm,1572355349.0,"it hard to see the good when the bad is so much easier to make bigger. i feel like a failure,  but actually everytime i relapse im like whoa thats a lot of thick cum, and im kind of sickly proud in a twisted way of being able to produce that now in comparison to the thin daily drip of yester months, but still its hard to celebrate progress and i wish it was different but hopefully no fap will help with being able to feel good with my life again once i can do longer streaks."
NoFap,f5pb8um,t3_dopiyg,1572354838.0,"its really hard, i dont want to connect my thoughts of god to my shameful acts of reality but i suppose i cant live in denial forever. next time i get the urge ill try to think of it this way and pray it out, thanks <3"
NoFap,f548t4y,t3_dmr24v,1571974333.0,"im interested in how much benefit you got there just before the relapse, was it worth the fight?"
NoFap,f35pyt3,t3_dfsn7t,1570685613.0,"hey man, i think you are off to a great start and understanding of whats coming, fill up time with whatever you can do to be productive, push your comfort zone out a bit try something new. be careful of people private messaging you to help you, but what they really want is money for ""life coaching"" but there are good people here on the same journey that will do that for free.  the biggest nofap discord group all about mens life improvement: [https://discord.gg/MtExBH](https://discord.gg/MtExBH)  

im here fighting the urges hoping they turn into positive energy soon"
NoFap,f35pj9v,t3_dfsr4o,1570685128.0,"its just switching another addiction but i go to sugar a lot, sometimes i take a shower, but i get thats a trigger for some people. i study my religion which is a strong motivator for me, just pace, meditate, let the thoughts pass that kinda stuff. but no nothing will take them away, and victory lies in overcoming them, you gotta commit 100% or the urges will seep in. its up to you but peeps here help too"
NoFap,f35p449,t3_dfq99i,1570684669.0,"i think this is a good message for those struggling with relapse but maybe not so great a thought for those who are in a streak getting the urges, thinking just one little relapse wont hurt that much, i can always try again. im the latter and struggling"
NoFap,f35ox0c,t3_dfrkr6,1570684453.0,"fuck man, im a pretty broken man, i always fuck up having a job, thankfully im blessed with a loving family and living rent free, im so fucking bored all the time. slowly im trying to do more things like yoga, cleaning, helping my nephew with his homework n stuff but still i have hours and hours of nothing to do time. thats definitely when those urges start looming. im hoping i wont feel the urges the same way if i can just break a certain day count where i can put that urge energy into other things, the transmutation. i hope we make it man"

NoFap,f2zbnl3,t3_devlye,1570513628.0,"so theres the dopamine obs not tiring out your happy button helps, but also, facing the shame (if you have that) helps you grow as a person more comfy in your body, able to communicate better, more positive mindset, thats the baby steps to changing the world IMO but im a hippy so call me crazy its tru"
NoFap,f2zbhmz,t3_devlve,1570513420.0,"personally after a lot of soul searching i realized how much shame i was hiding to myself about my porn addiction. it fucked life up for my partners cause i had porn induced erectile dysfunction (PIED) and me personaly while a younger my was energetic outgoing and extroverted, this shame that i kept supressing had made me feel like someone with something to hide, so i became introverted didnt talk much and isolated. of course that lead to the whole suicidal tendencies and hating my life. but once i opened up to being a porn addict it was like fuck it they know im a shameful POS already and while no one said much the response that i did get was very positive, like poor you i cant relate but it must be tough, i feel for you. so a few points of advice, one realize how negatively it has impacted your life, thats a lot of weight, find someone to share it with. personally i like quite a few guys in this discord channel specifically made for men improving their lives and a focus on masturbation and porn addiction (be wary of the ""coaches"" theat will message you on reddit asking for money to help you with accountability, the discord has honest helping people to help with that for free) and lastly people can want to help and do their best to help you, but it has to be you that says no, and you have to do it as soon as possible every time you feel an urge with 100% commitment, there is no other way, but the alternative is a dead life. heres the discord channel invite link: [https://discord.gg/mFxxes](https://discord.gg/mFxxes)"

NoFap,f2zahpn,t3_devi8j,1570512220.0,"i just heard of this wil hof cold showers idea, your body negatively reacts because it knows its about to step into something you wont like, its the flinch of the body to say no, dont do that its scary and uncomfortable, and by forcing yourself to survive this harmless cold water you exercise your own will over your brain trying to tell you its scary and dont do it. no fap is the big challenge but i think cold showers is gonna be a challenge too"
NoFap,f2zab76,t3_devhjs,1570512014.0,"congrats on starting the journey, if i can offer one piece of advice its to pay attention and be honest about your triggers and shut them down as soon as possible before they can affect you.   


i watch anime and theres these ads about all the hot singles in my area, so i installed an ad blocker, certain games that i always play late at night, neighbor to the time i usually fap, they had to go. its all about putting your whole heart into it and having that strong commitment ready to be called on, gl fam, taking back our lives"
NoFap,f2za0dj,t3_dev69x,1570511665.0,"for me its about fighting the things im ashamed of, for me thats porn. untying that shame knot is what has so much healing, so you have to be honest with yourself and acknowledge where in life have you been doing bad and then work to fix it"

NoFap,f2z9uwr,t3_deva05,1570511492.0,"great insights, my thinking is about trying to get new things into your life to focus on, new hobby if you got the time, new job, new lifestyle things like meditation or yoga, exercise as a whole is super important ive heard, but yet to fully dive into. keep up the good work and i hope to see you posting an even higher day report, just put your whole heart into it lets go all the way"
