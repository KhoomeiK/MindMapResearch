One bottle was normal water, while the other was laced with heroin or cocaine.

But when **several** rats were put in a cage with plenty of toys to **play** with, ***they barely drank any of the laced water***. Another example is the Vietnam war. In Vietnam, about 20% of American soldiers were using heroin on a regular basis. Makes sense, they could kill or be killed at any moment, and heroin helps them escape that terror. Americans at home expected that, when the soldiers returned home, the streets would be filled with addicts and junkies. But, after their tour, when they returned home, ***95% of them just stopped without serious withdrawal symptoms***. If you have happiness in your life already, drugs aren't much to you.

Telling people ""it's a hoax, a fake virus so the government can control us"". So stupid. I really can't feel empathy for those who continue to hold church, and those who decide to continue attending. News is filled with stories like ""pastor dies of Corona after holding service amid pandemic"", and honestly I can only feel relief that they're finally dead and not putting loves at risk. News nowadays sound like satire, like it's just as a joke. But it's real. Hurts to watch greed, stubbornness, and stupidity kill those who are most at risk, and who do everything right. It's crazy how these people can't seem to grasp the concept that their choices don't just affect themselves, but those around them, too.

Then the wings are at the very back. No. No. That's not how lift works. The plane should be doing loops. Stop. Then EVERYONE in the cockpit leaving to see what's going on. But I guess it's no problem, because the cockpit doors are NEVER locked. Also, the pilots either look like they're 90 or teenagers. And parts breaking off of the plane, while the plane continues to fly perfectly fine like nothing happened. Planes have those parts for a reason. When the vertical stabilizer falls off, it's not a little inconvenience. You will almost certainly crash and die. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
