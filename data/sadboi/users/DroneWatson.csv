More frequent poops (regular walks) also help. 

I've just accepted it and I take him to the vet to have them expressed whenever he licks his arsehole (thank the gods they don't leak). It's always easily expressed and not grainy or thick so no worries about infection, and I don't think it's necessary to put him through surgery.

Our purebred schnauzers don't have gland issues except for at the tail end of winter when we usually have to take all of them in. The vet has speculated that it's because they keep their poops in longer because they don't want to go out in the wet and cold."
