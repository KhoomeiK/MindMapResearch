AskReddit,fondtps,t3_g88ccd,1587917574.0,"A man was trying to avoid being arrested and went running through our neighborhood emptying his illegal pills as he went. I not only saw a crazy man running and throwing stuff but cops chasing him as well. It took a long time for all those pills to wash away. I bet they made the fish happy in the stream behind my house. Later learned that he was a major drug dealer and had huge bags of pills he was dumping as he ran. 

Another time I woke up to a swat team using my yard as a place to scope out my neighbors house so they could take him by surprise and capture him since he was refusing to enter police custody by himself. I think he was 16 or 17. They ended up having to bust down the front door and do their whole crazy swat thing because he barricade himself in his room with weapons. The crime unit showed up and took a bunch of stuff out of the house in bags. Lots of undercover police cars were parked in my neighborhood for a while which made sense after that.

Edit - 

Another time it was really late at night and there was a loud banging on the front door like it was going to be bashed in. I looked out my window to see what was going on and saw that it was my friends mom. I went over to the front door and opened it and she came running inside saying I have to hide her. The police were looking for her and she ran into the laundry room and locked herself in. She was drunk and had peed herself and was crying and screaming. My parents came out from the back yard and basically had to take the laundry room door off to talk to her. She said she had thrown a beer bottle at her husbands head and he called the cops on her. A few minutes later the police showed up at our door and my dad told them he will convinced her to go back up the street to her house. Like 15 min later she finally decided she would go and my dad went with her."
