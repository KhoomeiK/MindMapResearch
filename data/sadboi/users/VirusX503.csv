electricians,fqrv1ze,t1_fqruxwj,1589592506.0,Im guessin that the nest did that without the Rh wire cause the wire input ports to the nest are only nig enough for 1 wirem i just tested the heat and it still works so i have no idea if everything is gonna work
electricians,fqrt7ga,t1_fqrt521,1589591386.0,Sorry i didnt really understand its just confusing to someone whos doing that for the first time ya know
electricians,fqrsovy,t1_fqrskq4,1589591074.0,So the Rh cable is only that little cable connected into both so will i be fine even without it?
electricians,fqrrwru,t3_gklaa4,1589590601.0,I do apologize if this is in the wrong subreddit i have no real idea of where to place it.
playstation,fqkwrvr,t1_fqkwqg7,1589438608.0,They seem a little pricey but quality is always worth whatever price
playstation,fqkwmls,t1_fqkvqkd,1589438481.0,Ill have to take a look at them then thank you for the info
Spectrum,fqciidn,t1_fqcidzc,1589259091.0,Yes we did test the outlets by unplugging and reflipping breaks still did not work and yes all the stuff you mentioned and yes new cables/outside box was setup it seems
Spectrum,fqcicl8,t1_fqci4if,1589258974.0,Thank you for the info im upset cause my wife was telling me that he didnt wanna test to see if the cable or wifi was working correctly after it was setup and just acting like he didnt wanna be there to do the job
Spectrum,fqchxah,t1_fqchpr7,1589258658.0,Also i just noticed the rest of your comment. no the outlets are all on the back wall area to the backyard
Spectrum,fqchuu7,t1_fqchpr7,1589258608.0,We flipped every breaker switch on and off for everything still no power to the stuff mentioned above so i have no idea what could have been done to cause it but everything was working before the tech was here
Spectrum,fqavd45,t1_fqav97m,1589225932.0,I do have my ps4 and pc but i gotta find a longer ethernet for the pc to test it otherwise im in that one or the other bs
Spectrum,fqath9g,t1_fqat6r2,1589225002.0,Its all good its just completely killing me cause its unusable i wasnt expecting it to be that bad especially going from att fiber getting a few 100 mbs to spectrum and getting 4 mbs is a huge drop and then the tech unplugging my stuff without telling me and making me choose do i want to watch tv amd game offline or do i want wifi but no tv and gaming
Spectrum,fqalgku,t1_fqalcbr,1589221074.0,Ok thank you for the info im just kinda upset cause the switch wasnt my decision cause we went from att fiber to spectrum 200 mbs so extremely noticeable change
Spectrum,fqakyca,t1_fqakpxv,1589220828.0,"I ran a speed test wirelessly(2.4G) because the tech unplugged my tv and ps4 now i have nowhere to plug those things into and the ethernet to my pc is not long enough to reach the router so i cant test a wired connection
 The test showed download speed is 4 mbs and upload 10 mbs"
StarWars,fpfd32g,t1_fpfcwxu,1588567758.0,I would love to see more clone wars content someday but thankfully i can rewatch everything with my wife whos never seen star wars before and relive it all ontop of later down the road showing my kids. Im deeply sad that it finally came to an end but at the same time glad i could be along for the entire journey it brought us
StarWars,fpfcjcr,t3_gd5160,1588567329.0,I loved growing up with this show star wars was and will always be a huge part of my life the ups and downs of clone wars was amazing i do plan a bigger tattoo tribute for it in the near future with everything thats happened my rex helmet doesnt do it enough justice

medical_advice,foelycg,t1_foelv11,1587707375.0,Thank you and that must suck for him i know this drives me crazy sometimes. Im guessing its best to just leave it alone?
medical_advice,foel7m8,t1_foekw85,1587706764.0,Most likely just seems like itd have gone away by now.
medical_advice,foek1gz,t1_foejxke,1587705821.0,Thank you ill do so if it starts causing problems its just my curiosity that always gets me to wonder what it is and i cant ever find anything online.
medical_advice,foejgr2,t1_foejbqc,1587705379.0,I dont think thats the case cause i actually was stabbed in my arm when i was around 10 with a pencil and that left a hole as well but that healed up didnt heal nicely but healed none the less. This just seems to be a hole that wont disappear
scoliosis,fnxloo3,t1_fnxlgab,1587341248.0,Thank you very much for the advice i did go to the doctor earlier last week and they did refer me to a orthopedic surgeon to see what should be done to help fix my scoliosis so hopefully they will call ne back to setup an appointment with them and get the process started.

Alienware,fmevo3e,t1_fmevjhr,1586014536.0,Thank you so much for the advice i was able to return it but next paycheck when i pick it up ill keep this in mind
Alienware,fmemda7,t1_fmembnw,1586008242.0,Hopefully they wont. Thank you very much for your help
Alienware,fmelz1w,t1_fmeltq1,1586007937.0,I bought it at bestbuy so should i just go take it back? It would likely be quicker to either get a replacement or just get my money back and give my wallet a break 😂 i had also gotten the rgb keyboard and all that hurt
wifi,fm6ezcb,t1_fm61zvl,1585792584.0,At&t actually gave us a new modem today but im not sure it completely solves the problem cause i lost internet access twice after it was setup but for the last 3 hours i havent so who knows yet
depression,fkno3d5,t1_fknnn35,1584370255.0,Im 23 i know what people think at that time but at the same time its high school the likely hood of seeing those people is slim and even then its just sex theres so much more shit to do like i never had sex until i was 22 instead i worked by selling snacks at the school for all 4 years then went on to use that money to help jump start my Jewelry business the issue is kids care so much about sex when it doesnt matter whatsoever who cares what others think about you having had sex or not. If they bully you or make fun of you use that to fuel your desire to show them up. It doesnt have to be sex you can outshinw anyone anyway possible
depression,fknmai4,t1_fknlzcg,1584369126.0,Your not wrong there but at the same time it is high school while at the time it feels like that stuff matters more than anything looking back at it i think alot of people can say that the issues they had were childish or unnecessary.everyone is still growing up and making bad choices. Everyone is different and it is just my thoughts on the matter.
virgin,fknjujv,t3_fjl296,1584367520.0,Bro im gonna be brutally honest man the fuck up aint no one caring your a virgin it isnt the end of the world. There are millions upon millions of virgins in this world. It seems more like your personality type is what turning people away agter looking through your post and comments maybe just start being a light hearted person who doesnt just wanna lose his virginity
depression,fknjbek,t1_fkniicw,1584367149.0,This right here is the truth who honestly cares if youve had sex or not. Only stuck up elitist and shallow people you dont need in your life to begin with. Everyone has Sex eventually some take longer than others but thats fine. Like this guy js taking his lack of sex to an extreme upset no one wishes death on virgins
virgin,fknip4h,t3_fjkz4j,1584366716.0,Some people may find it funny some may find you have amazing self control to not have had sex yet others will be ok with it we as a society have alot of different reactions but not all are bad in the end its entirely up to you but either way i hopw college goes well for you and please dont think being a Virgin is such a bad thing we all meet the right one eventually or get lucky sooner or later
electricians,fklqfen,t1_fklq9fe,1584312313.0,The house use to be 2 separate houses but was later combined into 1 so it might be the room thats currently the kitchen wasnt always the kitchen
electricians,fkkuuik,t1_fkkupuq,1584292419.0,I did shes just very forgetful so she forgot what i was doing. At this point i told her to just go out to eat and hangout with friends until im done for my own safety 😂
electricians,fkkqcmq,t1_fkkq9yo,1584289717.0,Will do. Rather not mess up this houses electrical system and wires
electricians,fkkpffd,t1_fkkoouh,1584289156.0,My issue now is it looks like the wires are looped around the screws to give it power and i cant pull the outlet to far out like thw photo shows how far it can go out and thats that so i have no clue how to remove the wires for the switch
electricians,fkkp1kd,t1_fkkoouh,1584288922.0,My wife had switched the power back on cause it seems the room im working in and the kitchen run on the same switch and she didn't tell me. I just figured out by looking at the light switch which has a little red light in it when it has power. Thank god i wasnt dumb enough to try continuing the switch
electricians,fkkosx1,t1_fkkooza,1584288773.0,I did test it and it turns out my wife flipped the breaker back on cause the kitchen also had the power turned off so it seems they run off the same switch. Thankfully i switched it back off
Warhammer40k,fkj21ox,t1_fkj1m8m,1584234199.0,I didnt know that thank you for that information
Warhammer40k,fkj1hrk,t1_fkiysce,1584233796.0,Thank you being the only person to use litanies at the sotre i go to and learning them while learning the game it was very easy to pass over or misunderstand and never be corrected
Warhammer40k,fkilvk8,t1_fkijapl,1584223089.0,Misunderstood them or just misread as i was first learning and im the only one who uses litanies at the warhammer store i go to so no one to correct until today
Warhammer40k,fkij5oq,t1_fki5bw3,1584221246.0,Thank you ive been doing it wrong then ive beem giving both Chaplin grimaldus and a primaris Chaplin fire of devotion using both on emperors champion
Warhammer40k,fjzedo0,t1_fjzeadp,1583717761.0,Same here especially being black templars the melee aspect of them combine with loving combat really gets me to lose
Warhammer40k,fjze6d4,t1_fjze27u,1583717628.0,Custodes did im still really needing to work on strategies im getting caught up in the moment and not making the smartest choices that i could be making so i tend to get slaughtered easily
AttTech,fjpomod,t1_fjpojqd,1583556604.0,Thank you so much for the help it sucks cause my job depends on a stable connection to the internet and i cant keep killing my data plan with a hotspot as a substitute
AttTech,fjpodyo,t1_fjpoakg,1583556400.0,"Its happening randomly throughout the day like yesterday it happened during the evening, last Monday it was in the morning,today was during the night(about 15 minutes ago)"
Warhammer40k,fjpdh0e,t1_fjpctks,1583547981.0,"The thing that works best is drop pods which can be dropped in turn 1 anywhere on  the map as long as its 9 inches away from any enemy models so if you buy some vanguard veterans which are melee based but run them as company veterans you get a squad of marines who can take a wound for a character so lets say you have 2 drop pod which i believe can hold 12 marines in each you bring 4 company veterans which is 20 total for the other 4 slots you bring high marshel helbrecht who gives rerolls for failed hits, Chaplin grimaldus who has some very helpful abilities, emperors champion who is just a strong boy and a apothecary to help heal. You then have a pretty deadly force in enemy territory and the best part BTs chapter trait is getting to reroll charges  we excel at melee but getting into can be difficult if you dont know what your doing. So do expect to lose alot but dont give up and dont forget just have fun and try whatever you wanna do"
Warhammer40k,fjpclb9,t3_feodde,1583547350.0,Black templars are in a sense good at deep striking since they are best in melee. As a starting army they are a good army in my opinion for it considering i started with BT and still havent switched for a few years now but at the end of the day just do your research and try out a few different chapters you'll find the one you like the most
BlackTemplars,fjju9ud,t3_fduo58,1583412356.0,I love how they look absolutely beautifully painted
Warhammer40k,fjgdybr,t1_fjgdvzv,1583323489.0,I didn't know that thank you for the info ill have to read armageddon for the short story and just to reread helsreach
Warhammer40k,fjgdrgu,t3_fdbrzl,1583323295.0, Helsreach is a good book if you like black templars. If you havent read it i would definitely recommend it
Warhammer40k,fj2zhwp,t3_fb85j7,1582960035.0,"Theres a possibility that the space marine chapter Black templars are so overly religious is due to a malfunction in their gene-seed. They also do not follow the codex astres and are rumored to number around 6,000 troops so the inquisition is constantly investigating them."

CasualConversation,fj2yu10,t1_fj2yqu0,1582959214.0,😂 i buy alot to try to save for the entire year but that never happens its usually gone in half a year and its it's normally around 50 boxes. But i also have a wife and share with friends so i could probably save if i didnt share so much
CasualConversation,fj2ymuy,t3_fb8mla,1582958973.0,Ive cleared out 2 separate girl scouts of their thin mints. It honestly becomes a problem especially if you have a hugely disposable income

StarWars,fj2xz8n,t1_fj2xqic,1582958196.0,Thats the plan cause it would suck to get one of their helmets then season 7 is just a big ol turd. So far though im loving the first 2 episodes of it.

MiniLadd,fhp6ua9,t1_fhp5fhc,1581783352.0,Thank you for the very detailed explanation im a jeweler by trade so copyright and the like dont come into often enough for me to be well informed about it and im glad that mini is fixing his mistake and seems to be real about it. I also hope this post didnt come off as rude and disrespectful to those who copyright striked him i was just genuinely curious about how that worked
MiniLadd,fhp4pjk,t1_fhp4l8a,1581781868.0,I just figured they didnt since there isnt any shoutouts or mention of the posters depending on who is the reddit youtuber. Thank you for telling me that
anime,fhch5ct,t1_fhcfh0n,1581462923.0,I do and after people pointing out stuff like black clover its weird that only world trigger is the one that bothers me about it i think its just the combo of recap and the intro music being anywhere but the intro combined
anime,fhbwo99,t1_fhbwcf3,1581451456.0,It does seem weird to do a full recap episode but i guess it helps sometimes. I never got into one piece after watching 6 episodes i just couldnt continue so i never knew that it also recapped as hard as world trigger
anime,fhbwjwx,t1_fhbw1z1,1581451382.0,Like ill still skip through it and i never saw one piece tried to but after the first 6 episodes i gave up couldnt get into it. I thought world trigger was the only anime to really recap that hard
Warhammer,fh8g4cx,t1_fh8fzgd,1581359007.0,Thank you very much for your input i was thinking lead belcher as well after using it on a knight awhile back but i just wasnt sure if that seemed like the right idea  compared to mechanicus grey

MechanicAdvice,fgh3vxz,t1_fgh3rqe,1580776081.0,I actually found out the problem. I replaced #13 again and tried a different plug in charger which worked fine it seems the one i used the first time blew the fuse so i just trashed it. Sorry for not updating sooner been a busy day
MiniLadd,fgg16xw,t1_fgg14ue,1580752015.0,I did not know that actually thats very sad to findout
MiniLadd,fgfh2zs,t1_fgfgyjb,1580738542.0,Oh hell yeah the best we can do for the time being unless we personally know mini outside of videos and live close to him is send him positivity and wish him the absolute best on relaxing and when hes ready we will be here to continue to support him and his career
MiniLadd,fgfee9l,t1_fgfe6gd,1580736251.0,"""We drifted apart"" in his statement can mean a mutual agreement to some thats how i view it anyways. I apologize if im wrong man but its just from memory i had to go back and look at the statement and i still stand by how it seems to me as i read it"
MechanicAdvice,fgfbns8,t1_fgep6lf,1580733575.0,I replaced all 3 you said with new fuses. Turned the car on to try the lighter lights flickered and still didn't work so i had to turn the car off and check. #13 blew already so i have no idea what it could be
MiniLadd,fgf941x,t1_fgf932s,1580730723.0,Glad to have helped
MiniLadd,fgf9141,t1_fgf8ymr,1580730622.0,From my understanding and i have no real say its just from what i remember  he told twitter it was a mutal agreement that just over time they drifted apart i dont think they dislike each other they just realized hey a relationship aint what we want anymore
MiniLadd,fgf865s,t1_fgf82nt,1580729506.0,I think he should be ready to go with all new ideas and stuff once hes back from vacation. Im the same way with my job i just get burnt out over time and need to take a step back before i can keep going

MechanicAdvice,fgf6y8x,t1_fgemj0i,1580727788.0,Yea l tried it earlier it didnt change anything which made me wonder if it was the lighter itself needing to be replaced
