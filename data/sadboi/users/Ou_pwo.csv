Then, my dad had a girlfriend who was a crackhead and a junkie, then a space rocket (tiny) was coming right at the window of the appartement and it finally didn't killed us. Then, we went at night and children tried to kill my friend and finally I was watching a cursed video which was a weird super cheap kid show but then the weird thing of it came in real life and was observing me.
