Hamilton,f47eo82,t1_f475hgq,1571421377.0,"I definitely know where you're coming from but I promise you that you can do it. There are a lot of new people and people who aren't necessarily strong climbing there everyday. You start on the easiest problems and it's barely harder than climbing some awkward stairs. Once you can do all the level 0 and level 1 problems, you start trying to do 2's. And with a little time and dedication 3's and 4's etc. Sucking at something is the first step to being kind of good at something!"
Hamilton,f47411a,t3_djnejn,1571417094.0,"Go indoor rock climbing at gravity. You can get a day pass and rent climbing shoes and a chalk bag for like $22. There's an upstairs bouldering area that you can do alone and all at your own pace. If you need some advice or help, just ask pretty much anyone and they'll be happy to help. If you find you enjoy it you can get a membership and then go as much as you want, it's like $80 a month. If you make a friend you can go do the taller routes that require a rope and belayer etc. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions."

It's a front kick and once your thigh is all the way up before extending your calf, you turn your hips and stack one on top of the other and then your power is coming from the side instead of head on.
