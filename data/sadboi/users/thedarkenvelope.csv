furry,fbhx6qu,t1_fbezvir,1576884705.0,that sounds pretty understandable to me! Thanks for responding
furry,fbetqmd,t1_fbcvu1g,1576793726.0,I meant does making a character to represent you serve as a way to cope with dysphoria (gender or species)? Or is it a separate thing unrelated to dysphoria?
furry,fbcumia,t1_fbc0i1b,1576734408.0,"that sounds like a pretty neat explanation to me! But on the topic of sexuality and gender, I think it's becoming a bit easier to be open about gender-fluidity and the like (I'm trans myself), so just wondering is the animal thing an aspect on top of dysphoria, or is it a way to cope?"

ThatsInsane,f6bfuab,t1_f6ax7po,1572773201.0,winning awards doesn't make them a better role model in what they actually do to gain most of their fame. I dunno this is just my opinion
ThatsInsane,f6ap8wn,t1_f6ajv0s,1572760295.0,it's because they're celebrities that people stay interested. It turns an idea for a compelling talent show into garbage that's exactly like every other Australian show on air.
ThatsInsane,f6aospw,t1_f6abc3e,1572760097.0,"still, this show is what they're most known for in Australian media culture. It's also disappointing that pretty much all Australian cable shows are solely based around Australian 'celebrities' of which there are maybe a dozen prominent ones. that's all people seem to be interested in"

Talk to your GP about depression first, and then they'll likely try to hook you up with a psychologist or psychiatrist. good luck my friend"
