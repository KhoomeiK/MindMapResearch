podcasts,fq9ywwi,t3_ghbs52,1589209741.0,"Not a standalone podcast but Radiolab did a six part series in February/March titled [The Other Latif](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/other-latif-episode-1) that was pretty interesting.

>Radiolab’s Latif Nasser always believed his name was unique, singular, completely his own. Until one day when he makes a bizarre and shocking discovery. He shares his name with another man: Abdul Latif Nasser, detainee 244 at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. government paints a terrifying picture of The Other Latif as Al-Qaeda’s top explosives expert, and one of the most important advisors to Osama bin Laden. Nasser’s lawyer claims that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and that he was never even in Al-Qaeda. This clash leads Radiolab’s Latif into a years-long investigation, picking apart evidence, attempting to separate fact from fiction, and trying to uncover what this man actually did or didn’t do. Along the way, Radiolab’s Latif reflects on American values and his own religious past, and wonders how his namesake, a fellow nerdy, suburban Muslim kid, may have gone down such a strikingly different path."

Maybe they really do need to wonder what they did wrong, or perhaps simply what they didn't do when they had the opportunity to.

I'm glad that book helped you, I suppose I'm glad for anything that helps someone get out of a dark place, but it sounds horribly selfish and focused on everyone except the person who really needs support."
