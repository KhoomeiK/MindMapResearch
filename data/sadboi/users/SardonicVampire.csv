MMORPG,foqmdnn,t1_foowju3,1587996686.0,"You may have to be more specific lol

I'm going to recommend FFXIV first because obviously it's my heart and home (despite my current break). It has in depth crafting, public events, monster hunting, raids, dungeons, and a lfg and look for raid system in the form of either queuing for the specific raid, joining a party other people have started looking for the raid, or doing the raid queue. Same for dungeons. Also 1 character can do it all. And yes, it is heavily story based. The story actually does mean something and it progresses. Its...rough between end of 2.0 to beginning of Heavensward but after that it's amazing.

As far as the difficulty curve goes, you can get by being shit. But if you really want to learn to play your class well, and all the mechanics involved, it takes some skill. It's one of those games where you decide how much you're going to put into it. Also some classes are somewhat harder than others if you want to be a good player.  ...I should shut up now I'm going on too much. 

ESO is pretty good so far, every class can tank, heal or dps depending on what you put into your skills and traits. If I understand correctly (I havent reached endgame yet) theres 2 types of people. Those who are serious at competing at endgame and casuals. If you want to be the former, you have some work to do. If you want to have fun at it, it's easier. But you still need to figure out what to do in fights and such. It's free to play and the only reason to sub is the crafting bag (yes that is in fact a good reason to sub) and more furniture slots. Oh and the free crowns every month. 

This is turning into a long one my apologies. 

Ok Rift. I played rift when it came out and Gods it was the most fun experience I had in ages. Chloromancer is my *shit* let me tell you. But right now you dont need anything in the way of a group or anything as they have these public dungeons/instances you can join to level up in.  One is like a big dungeon, the other is a harder raid type. I say it's one of those games where the asses are easy to pick up and tough to master. Theres been like 2 or 3 expansions since I last played so I'm really out of the loop but it's there."

ESO you can literally fight dragons with the Elseweyr update. But as far as I know they don't have much in the way of mini games.

MMORPG,foo4m6c,t1_fonuhu8,1587932399.0,"ESO has a LOT of people running about doing things. I'm level 7 templar atm (although I have some chars in their 20s) and I see people running around all the time. The low level dungeons don't take a long time to get a group either. 

I have seen a bunch of people running about in low levels doing things in GW2, but their dungeons don't start until 30 and I think I only did 1 dungeon like once so I can't comment on how that goes."
MMORPG,foo44ek,t3_g58g1n,1587932125.0,"Ok all I'm looking for a great healing experience. I am playing FFXIV & ESO & Rift, and having fun but I'm looking to see what's out there just for the fun of it. FFXIV I got the healing part down no issues. My scholar is 80, ast is 70 and whm is 71.

ESO...is still up in the air. I'm too low to see if I like it right now (only a lvl 7 templar atm). Rift Chloromancer > Every other class in the world right now.

*What are you looking for?:*

* Great healing in dungeons and raids. I really wish I could find an off healer (like chloro) but I realize the support side of things is dead.
* *What games have you previously played?:*
   * All of them. Not even kidding.
* *What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?:*
   * Semi-hardcore. I like raiding but haven't found a group to do it with in a while. My ffxiv FC is empty :(
* *Any preferred mechanics?:*
   * I love love love when I can do dmg and heal and the more dmg I do = the more aoe healing. But that's few and far between. Otherwise I like hots like WoW durid or bubbles like disc priest over just straight up big heals like ffxiv white mag*e*
* *Anything specific you want to exclude?:*
   * Meh? I don't mind pvp healing, but I'd prefer pve only. I suck in pvp."

elderscrollsonline,fonci4l,t1_fon9fra,1587916830.0,That's good to know. It's something that's frustrated the hell out of me for the longest time now. I usually enjoy crafting but I guess I leave it alone for now.

Also some sort of explanation on how to properly do the weird ass ""you have to study this this and this and then find the Somebody of Somebody's crafting bench in the middle of bumfuck Egypt to craft this chest piece"" crafting system."

These are *absolutely* the reasons why you won't ever catch me trying to date ever again. I don't care how much my heart is longing for it, I don't need to get this kinda mess from neckbeards to already screw up the negative amount of ego I have. Being on reddit has shown me how bad it can get and gods, I can't even begin to imagine the kind of thick skin you have to have to try."
