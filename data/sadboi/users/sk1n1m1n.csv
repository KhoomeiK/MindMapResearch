No pointless cbt
No pointless recovery clubs, very degrading to me 
No pointless support groups, mixing with adults with understanding levels of three year olds, cos all of adults with mental health conditions are inpatient settings, at work or at home.
No more pointless talks of Laura, speaking about weather, she paid 3.75 for a bus with her carers d waited two hours..... why can‚Äôt adults with learning disabilities go back to their care home establishments, they social groups build in, they have their clubs in the local learning disability 
Adults with actual with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorders, anorexia  have got enough one their plate with their condition, their problems of life, we‚Äôve got coursework to do, projects to do for work, we don‚Äôt need unpaid carers to s much of moderate to severe learning disabilities and babysit them while their career goes out 3 hour fag ,(cigarette) and we are not allowed put on a cv voluntary care work.
People with mh condition go their to chill, to relax, to enjoy to talk about the issues that worrying them, them, their work, study, friendship issues. Relationship issues, home life or their kids or to escape from the their daily grind, we not babysitters for adults with learning disabilities who need a carers 24/7 it‚Äôs not dumping ground, dump your client here, piss is off for the day.
Art cafe was specially for adults with mental health conditions exclusively not patients with learning disabilities, we are not their ‚Äúmummies and daddies‚Äù

I was so fucked off when group runner decided to be PC  and inclusive by invite these clients to their do their dribbling and scribbling, we even had to had provide pre-school crayons, remove the sharpeners, rubbers, and lids of pens. So these ‚Äúpatients‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt think a rubber, crayon, pen lid is sweets and chocolate üç´ and we had to take intuitive and remove all dangers. Even the had to be 1990s bubble gum pop with no swearing and we couldn‚Äôt bring or sell a cup of coffee, so we we‚Äôre left with watered down orange juice in pre school beakers and the patients with learning disabilities had supervised 24/7

So, I would say to anyone who turns up these places, do not turn up, make an excuse  and clarify what support club does and expect to be bored out of your skull, expect to want or desire a quiet life, have activities indoors and domt set forward in these support clubs unless unless you know what they are talking about.. if it‚Äôs about music, latest chats about films tv, then go elsewhere because it won‚Äôt be what is advertised. 
Domt expect a cure a from your conditions..,

SelfCareCharts,fms07js,t3_fvs2s3,1586341987.0,"Look what helps my conditions is indoor environments, no turning up to groups I,e support groups, going to uni, I like some walking but it‚Äôs not things I enjoy,, my game, lots of meaningful penfriends and safe my safe zones, plus Xanax and modainfinil. I don‚Äôt need or want stupid support groups in real life too meaningless and pointless and does the opposite. 
I accept the following - I am currently a student, so I cannot fit in a part time job,  I am not not a lonely isolated feeling sorry for myself person, or prefer my introverted lifestyle. I have no bad thoughts or feelings about that.
I have been down that route of turning up to loads of places and it resulted in me feelings rubbish because of meaningless conversations the group were happening and having wrong perception. At the time I thought that the support club would be like on girl interrupted, little did I know that it was a bunch of people of people who knew already in my local area talking about the price of 5p carrier bags or bus / train companies and then I went to the other group as there was two and that w as when I was spoken to by thr staff and other people like I was ‚Äústupid, thick or retarded‚Äù. And there was misconception I was learning disabled and I‚Äôm fact I have learning difficulty and mental health conditions separately.
And like I have had depression, anxiety, ptsd and bpd for last 12 years even when I have worked, studied, had friends or haven‚Äôt had friends all these tried every ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù therapy known to man, tried counting to ten, cbt, tried all therapies that I made a decision a few years ago to pull out and bunk all groups and I have never looked back

Often watching telly or reading book can be feel impossible or having bath, these things are tiny bandaids for what someone is feeling and can do the opposite. A person who is suicidal is least thinking about their favourite movie, favourite book or having a bath.

I also feel that people take me more seriously, I have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù adult brain with actual knowledge and not someone who sits and reads mighty, Reddit and Facebook articles all day,
Plus my long term memory is improving, I have really good photographic memory, so I can remember what‚Äôs on the news a 10 or so years back like it was yesterday from the graphics and who was talking, what I was doing at the time putting the puzzle together."

DepressionRecovery,fm0e3yk,t3_frsec7,1585654871.0,"I don‚Äôt think of recovery  as ‚Äúthe person is cured, recovered, gets better‚Äù as I feel it‚Äôs setting people up to fail to believe it‚Äôs like recovering a broken leg or ankle. To me it‚Äôs about finding out what works for you vs what doesn‚Äôt and living with problems of life side by side.
For example : I do not turn to groups in my local area as personally it‚Äôs like pulling teeth, far too boring and meaningless, instead I prefer I quiet life, just me, myself and I and make sure that go uni and complete my degree, I ensure that my assignments are on time, ease stress when things bad etc. I also take Xanax, so I can have chilled evening after my work is done for the day or at the weekend and I take Modafinil so I function, get work done, assignments, revision, study etc. I avoid at costs any involvement with services, apart from my shrink or if. Y mh gets really bad."

Drugs,fl6z65m,t3_fhenim,1584888764.0,"I think it depends on what a person does on the drugs and how they function? For example if they are sitting at home watching a good movie with a friend or chilling watching Netflix then there‚Äôs no problems, of a person is busy working while on it or uses recreationally to play video games, keep going. Lol the problem is when it starts interfering work, school, uni or family lifer if it‚Äôs causing relationships issues et, another thing is when if the person is causing criminal problems."
