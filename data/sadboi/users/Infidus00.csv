So its supposed to encourage more people to get tested and treated instead of spreading it around.

And STDs refers to a bunch of diseases. I'd like to see the numbers specifically for HIV and if they've gone up or down.

Lastly I'd like to point out that poor neighborhoods tend to have less access to affordable birth control and decent sex education, resulting in higher transmission rates and pregnancies.

It might help if you just let her know that it's making you uncomfortable. Maybe you won't have to deal with all the explaining BS.

Does he just have cups/bottles of pee laying around his house?

Generally drugs like acid and shrooms have people acting more spontaneous, like, ""Oh my god, this tire has vibes...I...I gotta push it."" Not, ""These gods are telling me this liquid is the nectar of the gods, let me go about a complicated way of procuring it without it ever entering my mind that this is piss."" It's not like he can just hallucinate the gods lifting a golden chalice to his lips and suddenly he's got a real cup full of pee in his hand he's drinking. 🤷"

""Strange the Dreamer"" by Laini Taylor, #1 in the Strange The Dreamer Series

Summary: The dream chooses the dreamer, not the other way around—and Lazlo Strange, war orphan and junior librarian, has always feared that his dream chose poorly. Since he was five years old he’s been obsessed with the mythic lost city of Weep, but it would take someone bolder than he to cross half the world in search of it. Then a stunning opportunity presents itself, in the person of a hero called the Godslayer and a band of legendary warriors, and he has to seize his chance or lose his dream forever.

What happened in Weep two hundred years ago to cut it off from the rest of the world? What exactly did the Godslayer slay that went by the name of god? And what is the mysterious problem he now seeks help in solving?

The answers await in Weep, but so do more mysteries—including the blue-skinned goddess who appears in Lazlo’s dreams. How did he dream her before he knew she existed? And if all the gods are dead, why does she seem so real?

Welcome to Weep.  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28449207-strange-the-dreamer"

The scalp typically adjusts how much oil it produces based on how often you wash it. If you wash it every day, it will try to replace the oils being stripped away quickly. My hair doesn't start to look greasy until the end of the 3rd day now. Also only use shampoo on your scalp/roots.

As to person in OPs picture though, they obviously misunderstood to question. 😂 

I can believe not knowing how many people you had slept with. Years and years ago, a good girlfriend of mine, Janie had remarked to me that one of her friends made a joke about Janie being slutty, but seemed serious. Janie was feeling a little uncomfortable about it but told me she's had what she feels is an acceptable amount of partners given the circumstances. We talked a little more and then she wanted to make a list of all the people she'd slept with to have a solid number. She started to get pale when we hit around 25, and by 35 she looked like she wanted to barf. We stopped at 50, she said there was only a few more so that was good enough, but the look on her face while she said it suggested she was slightly disturbed. 😂 

I reassured her that she was happy and healthy, had enjoyed most of the sex, and no one needed to judge her about it, herself included. She still looked a little haunted though."
