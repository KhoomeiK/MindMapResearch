I know you're right, truly. Blaming myself is the easiest thing because yeah, losing control or not having it caused me so much anxiety. I did all I could and it feels like it meant nothing. I guess I just can't fathom or understand how someone just...uses another person until they move on, and acts like all they did, all the love and care and times together, meant nothing. I'm sure he feels something, but he can bandaid it with streaming, work and whatever other bs he tells himself to not feel shitty about his abhorrent actions.

internetparents,fpwrv1g,t1_fpwpiqy,1588968829.0,"Thank you so so so much for your words.

All my life I've followed my family country to country, so as great as it was, it does hurt when every x amount of time you're moving elsewhere. I was born in a small place that I stopped loving after travelling, and funnily enough, I was planning to move away, find a job elsewhere because being here made me miserable and no form of effort allowed me to find a job and freedom.

Then this Pandemic happened and ruined every plan, every decision and locked me down, made me worse. How do I push through this? I already felt disgusting and like a failure for wasting all of 2019 due to depression, now 2020 isn't looking like it's gonna be better, so how do you breathe and tell yourself it's okay after doing it 100 times with no positive result?

You hit the nail on the head so hard, it's like you know me. There's all this pressure to be independent, married or in a LTR, having life thought out - it's overwhelming. I thought I had my life all planned out, but then everything slowly started breaking, and I hurriedly and desperately tried to keep the pieces together but they wouldn't. I hate being 24, I hate being 25 in a week. My parents are getting old, my grandparents are dead, my uncle despises me and so does the man I loved. Where has my life gone? 

I'm sorry to hear life has been less than ideal for you, but your words are the words I wish my parents would tell me, wise and caring. I can't thank you enough. I'm still terrified, I know this will be hard, it already is. I've been crying for my ex, wishing he'd contact me, not understanding what I did wrong or why he stopped caring, despite a part of me telling me the whole relationship wasn't just fucked, but doomed. I deserved better, I've always been a doormat to people in my life because I was so scared to lose them and too lonely to respect myself. I guess it's taken this long and this much pain for it to click, if it even has. I'll probably fail time and time again, but I really want to feel better, or die. Either one works really ahaha."

> I think you are one of those

I don't know what makes you think that. I'm on reddit venting my stupidity hoping someone would give me an answer. I begged him to stay, ME, the person HE HURT SO MUCH. I feel so humiliated. And it's ME who keeps hoping he sees me, and messages me again more than just ""this is the right thing to do"" as if he fucking suffered at all, or felt anything. 

I'm sorry, kind stranger."

>Some dudes are broken and leech on stronger, good hearted women.

He was broken and I helped him through so much, I wasn't perfect and did stupid shit, but I don't think I deserved this. Being kicked to the curb because I'm a reminder of all the bad things he did, all the pain he caused. I guess streaming is better than drugs, but how can he be okay? How can he push me away like that? Y'all are just as emotional and confusing man."

*and daddy, which I helped get back into his life since I told him people change and I'm sure his dad loves him very much.


>A true man doesn't need to put others down to feel less insecure.

I just don't get why he did all he did. The abuse, the insults, the cheating and now pushing me away. It's like he had multiple relationships all at once and did all the bad and good with me. I tried so hard though."

Why don't they care? I've done everything. Nothing I do fills the time. My chest aches, my head - I want it to be done. He's so happy yappy and I'm crushed.

I thought he was it. My life is so pathetic it all feels pointless you know? I'm stuck, like genuinely stuck."

It won't get better, she'll keep using you until she moves on or finds someone else. You'll be broken regardless, but at least if you make the choice the pain will lessen quicker. 

I'm suicidal, I hate everything, I haven't eaten or gotten out of bed in days. I feel like my world just fell apart and all I can do is cry and beg for him to come back - which I did, btw. He messaged me something about ""it's the only way for us to move on/be happy"" I don't know, I haven't read it. He's okay, he's streaming, so I've run my use

Don't do that to yourself. Block, or silence them. Don't read their messages, let time pass. Think, cry, hit things, eat a lot but whatever you do, please, leave."

I have no job, live with a family who don't really care and have lost people I called friends. 

He won't ever come back, and it kills me. I won't find anyone who cares about me because I don't want anyone anymore. I've been hurt for so long, and it's all a lie anyways. I would've found someone already, instead I'm 25, single, unemployed and unlovable lmao."

I uses to make chai with the milk so I have an idea, regardless this isn't a tea I normally drink so I'll be more mindful!

Thank you!"
