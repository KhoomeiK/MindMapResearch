I'm having such a hard time getting through it and I don't know how to cope and I'm trying so hard to respect the space that he needs and he is doing his hardest to respect what I need but what we need is the opposite.

I'm not pushing for OP to divorce I'm just saying time means literally nothing and shouldn't be a part of an equation that involves your happiness.

OP could be happy mono with the wife and could be willing to fully recommit, but if that decision is made, the amount of time lived with her should absolutely not be one of the reasons."

BipolarSOs,evdc4wm,t1_evcdvb6,1564434793.0,"Bipolar is a spectrum as a whole. Everyone who has it displays symptoms differently. Some people have this symptom, some people have that symptom.
Bipolar is different for everyone, so obviously smoking weed is bad for some people and great for others.

I'm bipolar and I smoke weed, sometimes I smoke a lot because I have a lot going on, and then I realize I'm using it in a non-productive way and I stop for awhile until I can smoke it and have fun again or ease my anxiety. (Better than constantly taking my klonopin because I feel off balance and confused when I do.)
It depends on how your bipolar s/o reacts to it, and if they react badly to it then bring it up in the best way possible or ask them to talk to their doctor about it.

Ultimately you can't make anyone do anything but communicating repetitively that it's not a good idea and interacts badly with them is a good idea."

I dont know if it's a wise decision but I'm not going to tell my psychiatrist it's still here because he said ""no side effects, our goal is no side effects"" which I understand for the more serious side effects but this is so minimal that it doesnt affects t my life at all lol.

bipolar,etotedy,t1_etos7c6,1563037105.0,I'm going to continue talking to my doctor about it because ultimately getting to point of complete stability is the goal. Thank you for your insight!
bipolar,etohhom,t1_etoel7c,1563027809.0,"He told me to try doing that but I expressed my concern with it because it wasn't enough to control the rapid thoughts and I was always unfocused and uninterested to a small degree, which wasn't a huge deal but still made me uncomfortable. I was at 400 at first, but I still had leakage, at least 40% rapid/racing thought and manic symptoms, and hindered my ability to learn how to cope through life stress outside of my bipolar. It's weird as hell to me that just bumping it up 50mg turned it into my magical dose, but it stopped the leakage to some degree, helped clear my brain enough to work through outside stress, but my doctor is talking about possibly bumping me up to 500mg or adding another medication if my klonopin doesn't take care of the rest of it because my anxiety causes a spiral that obviously triggers a mildly manic thought path. I've only been steadily taking my klonopin every day now for about a week, and it has started to help a bit which gives me hope about it because I'm really scared of adding another medication to the mix and I'm working on getting over that because I have to be open to every avenue of recovery.

Also I'm unable to split my medication into two doses, one in the morning and one at night, because I need the full 450 in the morning to have a balance throughout the day. Taking my klonopin with it has given me the ability to have a smooth day without any incidents, and I tried taking the full 450 dose at night but it leads to a very uncomfortable and unmanageable next day that the klonopin only slightly helps with. And I don't get the brain fog that a lot of people talk about when taking the medicine in the morning, so that made me feel better about it.

The tingle really doesn't bother me so I'm not sure why my doctor is insisting on getting rid of it, but I have heard horror stories about it causing drooping in the face and it has thoroughly traumatized me enough to consider changing medications, which is the scariest thing to me overall."

bipolar,eq6j3gs,t1_eq6859m,1559830065.0,"No thanks needed friend! It took me a long time to get here, and I still have hiccups and I still have bad days, but every single day I wake up and try to remember that it is so worth it to be alive, even when things get tough. Especially when things get tough. I like to think that when things get hard, it's the end of a chapter. And when a new chapter begins, we're focusing on cleaning out the ashes, and beginning again but stronger. I've learned to accept the growth that comes at me, and I never want to stop learning about myself. I figure out a key part of me after every chapter. Every door closed is another discovery. Never stop learning about who you are.

And in my opinion, it is a beautiful way to live. To just learn and grow and grit my teeth when I really can't handle the stressors that life throws at me. And it's okay to cry and scream and feel defeated and hopeless, but never let the aftermath of that make you feel less whole. You are a person, with ever changing chemicals trying to take over your brain. Do not let them win, because you are so much more than what your brain is trying to convince you of. 

Now that I've learned more about myself I believe that bipolar is a very beautiful disease, as a whole. The absolute depth of our brains is unparalleled. I think about it in a healthy way though, not trying to be grandiose at all üòÇ
We are a very special group of people, and you should feel very proud of the victories that you have, even the small ones.

And I wish you the absolute best of luck, and knowing that I may have helped you in some way is a small victory for me. Because we all need that sometimes. We're going to need other people and we're going to need to be that person for somebody else. 
And above all, a stranger on the internet has faith in you, if that means anything at all üòÖ
You got this!"
bipolar,eq62vor,t3_bxavo5,1559820699.0,"Money is a big trigger for me too. And also, Bipolar IS a disability. We're going to have bipolar for the rest of our lives. There isn't a quick fix or a bandaid that can hide it. Medications may stop working after years, sometimes a big life event triggers a meltdown. The only important thing is to keep fighting.
My psychiatrist summed it up pretty perfectly for me when he said ""it isn't you, it's your brain. It is a part of you but it is also separate. It will control you if you do not fight, and the fight will get exhausting, but you have to keep fighting.""
My psychiatrist also said that bipolar people are some of the smartest people in the world. Like only highly intelligent people have bipolar. So that should definitely make you feel better because it boosted me up a bit üòÇ

My viewpoint is that getting better doesn't mean you reach the light at the end of the tunnel and then that's it, you're done. It means making a conscious effort to be a better person for you and you alone, for the rest of your life. It gets easier, so much easier. But it's definitely a winding road, and there will always be speed bumps and maybe you get a flat tire while you're traveling down it and you have a month long hiccup and maybe you take a few steps back in recovery but I cannot stress enough that it is okay to  not be 100% okay all of the time. My biggest regret is spending so much time hyper-focusing for so long on the fact that I would ""never get better, why am I not better, why isn't the medicine working."" But it's because I wasn't fighting for me. 
Regardless of how many therapists and psychiatrists you see, or how many medications you take, nothing will get better if you don't fight for yourself. 

And you definitely got this my friend, we have so much potential to be the greatest we can be, we just have to keep fighting."

I know I'll probably need a low dose antidepressant just because I'm not heavily depressed now that I'm medicated, but there's still an edge left that my other medications just aren't really fixing. I guess if I lose my sex drive then it is what it is, because I'd rather be healthy.

There's already such a big stigma surrounding mental illness, and most especially surrounding any illness other than anxiety or depression. 
BP people do have enough to worry about, but neurotypical's throwing around our diagnosis like an adjective shouldn't be one of them. 
I guess it is a person to person thing, but I've experienced way too many ignorant people who aren't educated about it to not care. If more people spent the time to educate themselves then being bipolar would a lot easier than it is. 

As shitty as it is, integrating into society is harder for us because we just work differently than other people, it's already way too easy to feel ostracized, we don't need another reason. Anxiety and depression are more widely accepted than any other mental illness is, and working towards breaking the stigma for other people is what's important. 

But just like the article says, it's publicly realized that you wouldn't say the word ""retarded"" to describe something/someone as slow, so why is it okay to say bipolar for something/someone that is unexpected, or ""flip-floppy"", for lack of a better word. It's a disorder that will affect our entire life, not an adjective that describes a brief moment of unpredictability.
