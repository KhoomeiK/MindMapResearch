webdev,f8dgonc,t1_f8dg5l9,1574490038.0,"yes, to make the container bigger you need to remove all margin and padding of the parent containers, I also noticed you have media-queries that  restrict  the width of the container, you can remove them so the container can grow even more"
webdev,f8dg5ex,t1_f8dfvla,1574489413.0,"btw to add inline css you have to do it inside the 'style' attribute, like this: <div  style=""text-align: center;"" ></div>

you cannot simply write css properties in the html element:) hope it helps"
webdev,f8dfvla,t3_e0djyi,1574489095.0," <div> <iframe width=""100%"" height=""900""></iframe> </div> 

the problem was that the iframe was too big, just set the width to 100% so it's as wide as its container, the container was already centered so that's it. If you want to make the iframe bigger then remove the padding and margin from its container so it  occupies the entire screen"
learnjavascript,f8dembw,t1_f8ddr2d,1574487653.0,"sure, you can either use an anonymous function like this:

hamburgerNav.addEventListener('click', function () {

navList.classList.toggle('showing');

});

&#x200B;

or declare a normal function and then pass it to the addEventListener function like this:

function toggleNav () {

navList.classList.toggle('showing');

}

hamburgerNav.addEventListener('click', toggleNav);"
learnjavascript,f8daxlp,t3_e0d0fw,1574483824.0,"the function you should use to add the class .showing is something like 

hamburgerNav.addEventListener('click', () => {

navList.classList.toggle('showing');

});

so '.classList.toggle' will add that class if the element doesn't have it, and remove it if the element does have it:)"
