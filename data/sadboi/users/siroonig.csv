sex,fqjeq0r,t3_gj0ijz,1589408901.0,"Your friend gave you terrible advice. Relationships are a team effort and the only way to make the team work is to effectively communicate to the other of their needs or wants. I absolutely agree with you that being the higher libido person in the relationship sucks because you have to wait for the lower libido person to be in the mood as well. And it most certainly isn’t fair that when you want sex it’s a chance of it happening or not happening. The only way around this is to talk and explain to your partner how important sex is to you and how often you need it. Then work together to come to some sort of resolution. I have had to do this in my own marriage as I too am the higher libido person and have had some very painful rejections from my lower libido partner. But with communication and team work we have an effective strategy that works for us. There’s no more heart aches, fights, or hurt feelings. And realize that y’all might be sexually incompatible and that’s ok too. But you won’t know until you talk. I wish you the best!"

For me, I sort of have a dead bedroom scenario. For all intents and purposes I have a very loving, and affectionate marriage. He loves me and I love him. Sex happens when it happens. It can be twice a week or twice a month. I of course would rather have sex more frequently but for my husband he’s good with a few times. I did a lot of soul searching and decided that this is a life I can live with because I’d rather have infrequent sex the lose my soul mate. If what y’all do is content and copacetic, and the marriage is otherwise happy and loving, then I do not think a “dead bedroom” is a big deal. Now on the flip side if there is just no affection, love, or tenderness, and very infrequent, lackluster sex, then I think the dead bedroom is a big deal."

I have a very unique last name and husband doesn’t. I knew that I’d never want to take husband’s last name simply because my last name means something to me. I’m first generation American and working towards a professional career. I think it’s rude to my folks who escaped a war torn country to start a better life for me for me to professionally use my husband’s last name. 

Now in non-legal ways I use my husband’s last name because spelling a 3 letter last name is easier than spelling a 15 letter last name. And socially I go by my last name hyphen husband’s name, kind of sounds like Kardashian-West. Our kids (if we have any) will just have his last name.

StudentLoans,fmp0u6f,t3_fwikel,1586272245.0,"There is a difference between canceling the forbearance and ending the forbearance. Cancelling places your account back in to its previous payment schedule, making it seem like you never were in forbearance. When doing this be careful because if you haven’t made a payment since the forbearance was placed it can make the account go past due. A safer route is ending the forbearance. Ending the forbearance will have you resume payments the following month. It will look like you were in forbearance for two months then were ready to make payments the following month. 

Hope this helps and makes sense!"

We plan to renew our vows on our 5th wedding anniversary and plan a bit bigger of a celebration. As others have said, do whatever makes sense for you lol!"
callcentres,fgtjcj6,t3_f0en1g,1581105258.0,"I was sort of in your position. I had graduated from school and couldn’t find a job in my field. I applied and applied, and nothing. Eventually bills started piling up and my depression kicked in. So I applied for a call center job that pays decently and I’ve been here now a year. The job itself is not difficult, and sure the clients are a bit rough. But a job is a job. As long as you continue to work towards getting into your chosen career field, I would consider other jobs whether it be a call center or somewhere else."
LongDistance,fgpoiff,t3_ezr4ih,1581008913.0,"Sending hugs your way. This part of closing a long distance relationship is something not many people realize or talk about. And I sincerely wish I understood or realized how painful and sad it is to pack up everything you once knew, say good bye to family and start all over again in a new place. It will get easier as the days go by. But for me, I’m always homesick. I miss my family every day. I hope for you that the homesickness doesn’t persist and you can enjoy your new beginning. Like everyone has said, if it doesn’t work out, it’s okay to go back home. 

Best of luck in your new life!"

AskMen,ffdkyuc,t3_esruuu,1579823087.0,My husband hardly ever wears his because he is a mechanic. No sense in risking his ring getting caught on something and degloving his finger.  It doesn’t bother me one bit. If he does wear his ring it’s when we are running errands or going on a date. Otherwise him wearing his ring is very rare.
callcentres,ff5dpq6,t3_ermanh,1579588571.0,"My cautionary tale though is to give an example that doesn’t violate company policy or procedure. For example, in my line of work, the loan holder can only authorize changes. If a spouse or parent call in, we can talk to them but they cannot authorize changes. Now if the parent or spouse gives a sob story about how the loan holder is sick or dying, we still cannot make changes. And let’s say you made a change to the account without authorization, while you made the customer happy, you broke company policy. So in your interview you wouldn’t want to explain that either I wasn’t supposed to do X, I did it to make the customer happy. 

I hope that makes sense..."
talesfromcallcenters,fe76tf2,t3_enpvq9,1578910754.0,"I work in a call center for student loans. There are a lot of parents who have taken loans out in their name for their children. Children who promise to make the payments, children that drop out of college after one semester, or children who just don’t care. It’s the saddest thing for me to see these parents close to retiring but yet have a $70k loan that they took out for little Johnny to go to school. And there’s very little we can do to help. So my word of advice? Never take parent plus loans out!"
callcentres,fdp1ot2,t3_em7arz,1578617892.0,"The worst is when it is in fact a simple call and you ask a simple follow up question, and then you get an entire story. Why do people do this? I just wanted to know the date you faxed the form, not your journey on how you faxed the form."

I felt everyone knew I was solo. I just focused on myself and got myself treats to distract myself. If you continue to go, it gets so much easier."

callcentres,f5s5vfu,t3_dp0y8c,1572413110.0,"Oh yeah! Happened to me for the first time on outbound a few days ago. The thing with my line of work is that we are not soliciting any type of service or product. We are calling because you’re seriously past due and about to default on your loan. Anyway. I reach this guy who says he is at work and can’t talk, which happens. As I was offering to maybe put the account on hold his boss interrupts him and says not to cut the blue wire, only the green...blah blah. I quickly caught on that this was a robo call because he said sorry about that, now what service were you offering, then promptly said shit I think I cut the wrong wire. 

We were trained in outbound about these types of calls. We were told to let the client know that they seem busy and we will call them back at another time. Then we are to mark the call as a robo call."
callcentres,f5rxvpx,t3_doyopp,1572405698.0,I work in a call center for federal student loans. Student loans are terrifying and paying them back is even scarier. I genuinely love helping those individuals who call in and are absolutely terrified of defaulting on their loan. Helping them find a solution that works for them and hearing them then breathe a sigh of relief makes me love my job. There are individuals who just don’t care their about student loans and treat you as the villain. But those few rare people who genuinely appreciate my help is why I keep showing up to work every day.

callcentres,eyjmtxc,t3_cx8zty,1567122805.0,"I 100% feel ya. I now do outbound calls as well with a dialer system. And when the line connects I have to greet the person “Hi john?” which is beyond weird. After confirming first and then last name, then I can say who I am and where I’m calling from. This whole greeting process doesn’t work in my opinion. It makes the person leery of you and not want to continue the call."

talesfromcallcenters,exsisq4,t1_exqjuhs,1566545946.0,I get multiple calls a day from people who decided to work with these third party companies and mostly those accounts have defaulted and gone to a collection agency. I don’t understand why a college educated person would think the federal government would text them about these programs. Like why??
talesfromcallcenters,exsikda,t3_ctmqah,1566545713.0,"I too work in a call center for federal student loans. Above all else please be mindful of working with third party companies. If some random company you’ve never heard of is calling you or texting you about different forgiveness programs or ways to lower your payments, contact your servicer. Do diligent research about this third party company. You’ll see they are mostly scams and horrible companies. I am so tired of getting calls from borrowers who paid thousands and thousands of dollars to this random company and none of those payments were made to the actual account which is now in default."
callcentres,exshud9,t3_cticc2,1566545008.0,I hate these calls. We send a bill statement and a notice two weeks before said autopay payment is set to be pulled yet I hear the bs excuse they did not know. How did you not know? We do this every month on the same date. And we sent multiple reminders!

Client answered the phone and I was trying my absolute best to help her, find a solution that would work. As I was going through my questions to help her she just kept saying I hope you feel terrible, that’s the only reason I’m staying on the phone with you. Like what? Why? You’re going to default on your loan and hurt your credit score. Why make me feel terrible for trying to help you..."
callcentres,evemeii,t3_cjmfm9,1564471360.0,"To keep call times down, my best suggestion is to just stick to the bare bones of information. If they’re calling about X, talk about X only and keep it basic. If the caller wants more info, they will ask for more info."
callcentres,etqkktr,t3_ccwddk,1563089225.0,"Call center type jobs depend on the company and the company’s standards. The call center I work at has very reasonable standards and good stats are achievable without going insane. 

My one tip is to walk or move around on your breaks. Do a bit of stretching while on calls that don’t require you to stare at your screen. Any little bit definitely helps. 

Lastly, don’t bring your day home with you. Once you clock out, erase your mind of the day. Go home and do something you enjoy. If you focus on the work day you will burn out and be miserable."
AskWomen,et0xcts,t3_c9fcyg,1562388524.0,"I get home a few hours before my husband. I’ll eat something, see if there is any chores or errands to run and get those done. Then I’ll just relax on the couch, watch tv or squeeze in a FaceTime date with my mom or best friend. When husband gets home, he will text me and I’ll get something whipped up for him to eat when gets home. After he gets home and eats, we hop on the couch to watch tv together. Or he will play some video games while I read a book on the other side of the couch. Once we have relaxed, it’s shower time and bed time."
LongDistance,esc4y41,t1_esc4ovh,1561821091.0,Oh you’re so welcome. I was more than positive I would receive the same type of criticism so I kept my engagement silent. Didn’t wear my ring in public or if I did I wore it on the wrong hand. Now it’s a fun story to tell others lol.
LongDistance,esc4g9m,t3_c6xa5b,1561820740.0,"OP I am sorry you’re getting a lot of slack for being engaged within a day of meeting. You’re not alone though. I had known my now husband online for over 5 years, built an incredible friendship and bond. We tried the whole long distance, online dating thing and it just wasn’t working out. Friends seemed to be the best option. One day we decided to meet in person and it was absolutely electric. We too were engaged within 24 hrs of meeting. 

I am not sure of your plan but we fought tooth and nail in our long distance for 3 years. I moved to his state, and we then married three years after that. Our engagement wasn’t so much to say we want to get married tomorrow or in six months. It was more so we know this is our forever and we want to cement it in stone. There’s been a lot of fights, heart aches, and sadness. But there’s been even more happy times. I truly wish you the very best and hope you guys have a great marriage."

How we are evaluated is very fair and what is expected of us is achievable without losing our sense of worth. I think the company you work for is what makes or breaks a person. This is not to say that the job itself is not stressful or annoying at  times, I’m sure all call center type of jobs can be at a point in time. But the company you work for can either add to that stress or help alleviate that stress."
talesfromcallcenters,eopo8au,t3_brk7ck,1558770489.0,"I work in a call center that handles student loans or small personal loans. The call that has stuck with me is this gentleman called in with his wife to discuss the account. The account was past due so we were talking about ways of taking care of the past due payment. We settle on a solution and as I’m reading the disclosures to get his permission to postpone payments, the gentleman mentions that he will be dead in a few weeks so it doesn’t matter when the loans resume repayment. He simply wanted to postpone them and then have us explain to his wife what she should do once he dies. He apparently is in complete heart failure and his organs are slowly shutting down. 

That call haunts me til this day."
