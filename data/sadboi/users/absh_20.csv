Then try learning a new hobby in the evenings like a musical instrument or read a great novel or do meditation and yoga videos on YouTube. I like doing a yoga with adriene 30 day challenge when I want to break a negative habit. Congrats on how far you have already come, it seems like a pretty normal routine right up to the evenings. You're nearly there! It takes one success, one night of doing something else and going to bed to prove you can. Then you know you can keep doing it even when you don't want to."
EDanonymemes,fr4lx4q,t3_gmiyyo,1589891792.0,"This is literally the hurdle to get over with EDs. You have to be in a bad enough place to decide that it's worth not being cool or sexy and it's better to choose recovery. And it's hard when you've lived the cool and sexy life and you don't want to go backwards from that. Choosing mental health however, means choosing stability, less anxiety, physical health and everyone around you being at peace finally. These aren't things teens for example value that much, so it's much hard for younger people to recover"

Even if you're totally functioning you can always go to a therapist for better strategies for the next bad moment, and prevention strategies. Even then, you can go to therapy simply to improve your relationship with yourself and others. I'd recommend it just to work on yourself at the very least. Look up different types of therapy too, like CBT, ACT, gestalt, Schema Therapy (my fav), DBT (my other fav) and psychodynamic/psychoanalytic. Good luck!"

If there is a good meta analysis, they may address it, and you can always email researchers around the world and most should reply with answers. It might be a case of this phenomenon being categorised into 0-20, 20-40, 40-60 etc. Not sure why it wouldn't be something like 45+. Perhaps due to average fertility wavering around 40 but not sure honestly. In your report you can say you chose to go with 40+ because the vast majority of previous literature did, and you want to make it comparable. Good luck!"

I found a happy medium with it. Stats is okay if you take the time to learn with interest. 
On that note, no one realises it's a degree for research teaching you either what research has found on various topics, or how to conduct research yourself. There is often no counselling training until the 5th year, at least in Australia. I'm lucky I like both research and counselling!"

EDanonymemes,fqdideb,t1_fq7vo7s,1589290321.0,"When I had severe anorexia I probably would have thought this would have been funny too, I get that. Kind of like the laughs you get at support group when you realise everyone had the same ED thoughts even though you all know they are perhaps not ideal thoughts for recovery. It's only now I have been recovered for a few years and have been running support groups at an ED centre, while studying to become a psychologist, that I don't think this is funny anymore. These funny moments are fine, so long as they are immediately followed by, ""however I realise this thought isn't helpful"", but they aren't. I think a lot of people reading this would find it really validating for their disorder, reassurance it's okay to be trying to loose weight when this weight loss could come at the potential cost of their livelihoods and even lives. I just don't think things that are positive about EDs are helpful for everyone."

Fleabag,fq7g12f,t3_gh9igr,1589145912.0,"I interpreted it as she is talking to her audience as it is based off a play which was fab, and it's a stage technique. It reflects her talking to her conscious but it really is an audience, as she tells the therapist that she has friends to talk to who are always there. Plural, which means audience members. My other thought is that she is pretending there is an audience there throughout her life because she is a performative person. Do you ever crack jokes and laugh at no one imagining if you were talking to an audience? She is seeking validation by looking funny and cracking jokes to only herself. She also talks about her life like a journal entry. 
At the end of season one she goes a full 5 minutes without looking at the camera in the play and the show, to signal she is growing up and growing out of her pretend audience remarks. 
The priest can see it's kind of a fake validation thing and he doesn't need her to be anything other than real with him. Just like a good therapist would. Likewise, she sees his fox, his own demons, need for validation and meaning and purpose."
