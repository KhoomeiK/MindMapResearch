All of the sudden the sky got dark, it started to drizzle, then out of nowhere a huge gust of wind came through. I heard a crack, ran and laid flat against the house cause I had no idea where the sound was coming from.  I witnessed a massive pine tree snap in half and take my neighbor's power line/internet cable with it. 

We were out of power for 6 days after the 'nado. During that time they had the same thing happen, plus their gutters ripped off, and then had their 3rd baby two days later. So now these poor folks are at home with a newborn, 2 young children and no power again! Hoping EPB can help them out asap.

She will be 28 this year and has zero self sufficiency. Plus, anyone who chooses partying and concerts over their child is scum in my book.
