I was 20 when I saw him and I started shaking all over as old fears mixed with righteous anger as I started shouting at him.

Eventually I ran away at 16 and became homeless for a while. While I was enrolled in 3 high schools to finish graduating HS at 16 (normal US H.S., self-completed Home schooling program, and an adult diploma program made an exception for a homeless teen trying to get to college) she spiraled with drug addiction (meth mostly). I heard through my family she became homeless as I was completing my B.S. in Illustration and starting my MBA (YAY fed. school loans). 

She died last year from lung cancer, homeless and continuing to refuse to even admit how she treated us as kids was wrong. Her children were always accessories to her, and all bad thing that happened in her life was due to external influences victimizing HER. She burned every.single.bridge she ever encountered. 

I got in touch right before she passed, but she wasn't very much in a reasonable state of mind. I forgave her, as she was clearly never someone who should have had children, and the suffering she brought on herself was more than my angriest teen gothy heart ever wished on her. I still struggle with my white-knight guilt:how I could have abandoned my quest for a better life and instead helped her out of her nightmare, but in the end my reliance on protecting myself at all costs was created by her in a way."

Since they are rare and random, I often see 1 of the 4 construct specialist mods before I see the standard mod for the construct. Before, the wild mod increased the unit number so if I took Wild Mod: Ally Spec, I would gain 1 ally from the mod on its own, and the 2nd when I finally roll the tier 1 Ally mod.
