raisedbynarcissists,fr12ab1,t3_gly4jg,1589811855.0,"honey I am so so sorry your mom is treating you like this. I hope you can get out of the toxic environment your mom has created as soon as you‚Äôre old enough, trust me you will feel SO much better and gain so much clarity from being away from her. In the meantime, try and hang in there. From what it sounds like your mom is verbally abusive, because the things she has told you are absolutely awful and should never be said to ones own child. I understand it‚Äôs made extra difficult by the fact she‚Äôs your mother and you love her, but you keep getting hurt by her and don‚Äôt understand why.  This creates a sense of learned helplessness, which is probably contributing to your depression and mental health issues. You have been experiencing these negative situations created by your mom, and you probably feel like what you do/say doesn‚Äôt matter, because despite how much you love your mother and try to explain your mental health issues to her she doesn‚Äôt empathize. Often people self harm or develop eating disorders because they are seeking for something, anything that they can control in a chaotic and stressful life (and anything to momentarily relieve this stress in the case of self harm). they can control food, bringing back a sense of agency despite the behavior being ultimately harmful. obviously I don‚Äôt know you or your situation, but this may resonate with you. 
first, don‚Äôt blame yourself. You did nothing to deserve this kind of treatment. second, make sure and stay in contact with any friends / family that make you feel loved and supported. They will be your lifeline during quarantine when you‚Äôre stuck with your mom. Finally, try and seek out any available mental health resources you can. there are quite a few apps and websites dedicated to helping people with self harm, eating disorders, etc. while these are not a replacement for professional mental health treatment, even minor improvements can greatly improve the quality of your day to day life. Hope this helps, hang in there."

He goes to school in TX and I go to school in PA so we only see each other once in a while. I sent her back a long paragraph about how my grades reflect this assertion is bullshit, I‚Äôm very involved on campus, etc etc. she doesn‚Äôt respond. Then, about an hour later, she responds simply with üòé. Since I had no desire to continue the Convo I left it there. The same thing happens with in person arguments. She will legitimately not respond to me, and if I reiterate my point again louder after getting no response in an argument, she usually leaves the room and closes the door. I‚Äôll avoid her for a few hours, then she pretends as if nothing has happened. My boyfriend has witnessed this behavior and is like ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù. Having a legitimate discussion with my mom is impossible, because she will flip between flat out pretending I didn‚Äôt say anything or just lying to me about what she did."

Anxietyhelp,fq1c705,t1_fpzxohq,1589044296.0,"If your anxiety is holding you back to the point where you are unable to get a job, you need to see a doctor. I advise sitting down and explaining the situation to your parents, and asking them to help you find someone within your insurance network if you have insurance. A lot of therapists are doing video sessions now, and if you have decent insurance the copay should be fairly reasonable. That being said, if you are a student your college likely has free mental health resources (though you‚Äôre probably not on campus right now). I would advise checking out the credentials of the on campus mental health services first, I know at my college I went to see a ‚Äúlicensed counselor‚Äù who was absolute trash and told me the exact wrong things for my anxiety. And I would know because I‚Äôm a psych major. She was completely unqualified, didn‚Äôt have a psych degree, and was just being ‚Äúoverseen‚Äù by a licensed psychologist. But since all of these things take time, in the meantime I recommend reading resources on how to better cope with your anxiety.

Anxietyhelp,fph8285,t3_gd7i8v,1588616610.0,"I think it‚Äôs really important to note that there are two MDD subtypes: melancholic and atypical. Those with melancholic MDD experience loss of pleasure in activities one previously enjoyed, early morning awakenings, persistent low mood thats typically worse in the morning, insomnia, decreased eating or weight loss, and excessive feelings of guilt.
Those with atypical MDD exhibit mood reactivity, weight gain or increased eating, hypersomnia (excessive sleeping), lack of movement (leaden paralysis), and high rejection sensitivity. 
Of course, this is by no means and exhaustive list, and many people with depression may have mixed symptoms. But I do think it is important to realize depression may manifest very differently in some people."

FundieSnark,fp05fm3,t1_fozdbrx,1588202826.0,also nobody can even try and tell me that an adult man can be ‚Äúin love‚Äù with a 12 year old girl. Has he ever met a 12 year old girl? At 12 I was a complete hormonal mess and had no idea who I was as a person really. You‚Äôre just starting middle school at that age. It‚Äôs not like an adult is going to be having thought provoking conversations with a 12 year old. They just want to manipulate them.
FundieSnark,fp05635,t1_fozdbrx,1588202686.0,"I just cannot fathom how a grown man could feel so secure in his belief that the age of consent should be 12 that he would post it on his public blog. There‚Äôs a big difference between 12-16 year olds getting into relationship/engaging in sexual activity with others their age who are similar in maturity, and an adult man targeting children.  The reason what Roy Moore did was so gross is BECAUSE of the huge age/maturity gap, in which he clearly knew what he was doing and how to manipulate and exploit younger girls.  I know that this fundie is advocating for Child marriage because if you marry a girl at 12, then in typical fundie fashion start trying to get her pregnant ASAP, you have essentially trapped them for life.  They‚Äôre young so they‚Äôre easier to manipulate, and the older adult may be the only ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù they‚Äôve ever known so they don‚Äôt realize how wrong it is. Further they‚Äôre isolated from their families and friends, preventing them from seeking help or support from others.  They then end up basically ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù under the control of their pedo adult spouse, and develop a kind of Stockholm syndrome where they think that sort of life is normal or okay.

If anything we need to fortify our age of consent laws in the U.S. Some states, like Texas, allow 14-year-olds to get married with parents' permission, therefore essentially legalizing statutory rape between the spouses.

Anxiety,foyp0ay,t3_gabrbw,1588176510.0,"I have GAD as well and tend to stay away from drinking, not because it directly increases my anxiety but because it fucks up my sleep which then indirectly increases my anxiety.  And I have had chronic insomnia in the past and don't want to return to that.  But anyways, I'm a psych major so let me just say alcohol is a depressant, and it is obviously very normal for it to cause you to be upset/anxious.  This is especially true of anyone with an anxiety disorder, because you will be much more susceptible to the negative effects.   Alcohol messing with your judgement/reasoning is also definitely not good for GAD, because it may allow illogical anxiety thoughts to be more frequent or emotionally salient than they would be if you're sober. 

I'm not entirely certain this is true, but since alcohol acts on the GABA receptors in your brain (the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain) you may now be feeling extra anxious the next day because your brain is overcompensating from the alcohols inhibition by producing more glutamate (the primary excitatory neurotransmitter), but this is just my own speculation based on the psychopharmacology of alcohol.  

Please, don't beat yourself up for drinking or feeling worse afterward.  The likely cause of how you're feeling is mainly biological, so you should give yourself a few days of rest and self care to get over this alcohol-induced slump and you should be back to normal, don't worry :)"

Prison,foyk1xd,t3_g9unbm,1588173931.0,"So I actually did a psychology paper on prison suicides (I'm a psych student), so I'll provide you with a few things I found in my literature review. First, suicide is the second leading cause of death in prison, behind natural causes.  Suicide rates in prison are significantly higher than that of the general population (no shock there).

Some statistics on the method of suicide: 93% who committed suicide did so using the method of asphyxiation by hanging.  Two-thirds of inmates used their bedding as the instrument, while other articles of clothing were used in roughly 16% of suicides. In addition, nearly 40% of those who committed suicide were in isolation or segregation at the time of their death.  

\-One study found About a third of suicide victims attended or were scheduled to attend, a court hearing close to their deaths.

Here are some predictors for higher suicide rates based on characteristics of the facility: high levels of overcrowding (higher overcrowding=higher suicide rates), high incidences of violence, and high-security level (more suicides occur in supermax or max security prisons), the distance of the facility from where the offender was arrested (ie can their friends and family visit them) and the percentage of inmates needing mental health services

Individual characteristics associated with increased suicide rates: death row status, previous suicide attempts or suicidal ideation, and history of mental health issues

This is by no means an exhaustive list, and obviously the research has limitations, but I hope this helps answer your question.  If you would like sources for the studies I used, I can provide them, but they may not be accessible since I get access through my college."

Anxiety,fo0azpz,t3_g4y8e7,1587409392.0,"Yes I can definitely relate. I had a similar elementary and high school situation, I was designated ‚Äúgifted‚Äù in math and science, and moved on to take many APs/honors courses in high school. I‚Äôm currently a sophomore in college, double majoring in political science and psychology. The reason I got diagnosed with GAD was because I got so stressed and anxious my freshman year I stopped sleeping for months. I had nonstop horrible anxiety, and I didn‚Äôt get more than 4-6 hours of sleep for about 8 months.  Sometimes I‚Äôd go 48+ hours without sleeping at all because I was so strung up on anxiety. This of course also made me extremely depressed, and I‚Äôd cry basically every day from the sadness/anxiety. I was also on all kinds of meds. Basically, the stress of college finally was the straw that broke the camels back and forced me to get help for my anxiety that I‚Äôd had for years but never saw as a serious enough issue. my parents also have EXTREMELY high expectations of me in college and the increase in workload really got to me. I felt like I was going absolutely stir crazy for a while. 

It completely fucked over my memory and made school 40x more difficult. When you don‚Äôt get enough sleep, or are very stressed over a long period of time, it has very detrimental effects on your focus and memory.  This has been shown in countless psych studies. You are absolutely not stupid, to me it just sounds like you‚Äôre really anxious and it‚Äôs been negatively affecting your concentration and memory which is to be expected. I hope you find something that helps. Getting on the right meds for me made a world of difference. Now I can finally enjoy learning again, but of course I still struggle greatly with my GAD."
