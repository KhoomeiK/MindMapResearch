They’re a bit more expensive, but so worth it!"

PanicAttack,eoghc6o,t1_eofx7sr,1558557956.0,"CBT stands for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I would definitely look it up and get yourself a little educated on the subject just so you’re not walking into it not knowing what to expect. It’s been very very helpful to me, and I hope it can help you too."
Anxiety,eoggjss,t3_brsq1y,1558557503.0,"I know how that feels. Have you talked to your professor about it? Even just sending them a quick email and explaining the situation may make them offer for you to make up the grade. 

I hope things go well for you and I hope you know it’s not the end of the world. You can figure things out and if by chance you’ll have to retake the class, see if you can let your teacher know before the presentation that you may have an anxiety attack and may need accommodations."
