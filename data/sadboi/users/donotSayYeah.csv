DecidingToBeBetter,fkr35bc,t3_fk6rpy,1584460924.0,"I know. When i was a child i could just go through a book and absorb it completely but now i'm 22 and recently only starting to rediscover that ability. I find that you have to do some preparations mentally and physically to get the ideal state for reading. I find that meditation, even for 30 minutes in the morning, helps. Another thing is stress and anxiety. Not feeling rushed or overwhelmed is a key. Also exercise or some kind of physical activity to get your blood flowing. And classical music on background volume while reading is great too. Perhaps you already do these things. In that case sorry that it was of no help."

DecidingToBeBetter,fe9d6bq,t3_eo5zgf,1578936497.0,"Hey friend. Just one month ago, i was in the same situation as you but now I'm a lot better and filled with so much happiness and new perspective. And i must say you are on the right track because you are starting to take notice and ask questions. And I've found out that when you start asking, that's when life starts to give you the answers.

Now i can't give you specific instruction because we are all different and have different circumstances but the important thing is that you can't lose hope. Believe that there is an answer and that there are people or things that will be able to help you. Have faith in something. It might not come so easily but i believe in what Paolo Coelho say in the Alchemist, ""when you really want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it"". Keep looking and keep asking."
depression,f9mhrqg,t3_e5qpk1,1575459566.0,"Sometimes I wake up in the morning and wonder if I even exist. The only thing that snaps me back is when I start to worry about my studies and my family back home. All my relationships feel meaningless. All my actions feel impact less. My presence feels pointtless. There is a girl I really like in class at uni and she likes me back. But I really question myself if I can really feel love for her, because at this point I feel so numb. At the same time I am really hoping she will make me feel again. I know its stupid to place all your hopes on someone you dont even know but perhaps it'll get better if you keep on hoping."
Advice,f9mh6eo,t3_e5op1f,1575458774.0,"Hey dude. I know what you're going through. Im currently 22 and trying to recover from a rough childhood as well. All I can say is that despite the depression and tough life, if I had not given up myself to negative thoughts, If I had not lost hope, If I had only looked towards the future, I would have had a much better and satisfactory life. Don't make the same mistake as I. Keep on hoping. Keep on working on yourself. I know there are days when you'll feel like giving up. Accept them as normal because they are and give up those days. Then the next day pick yourself up. Work on knowing yourself and your emotions. Be humble. Be kind to people. Believe in the goodness of people. Practice patience and positive thinking. Theres a lot I want to say but I don't have the confidence to say more. I only hope something in this rings with you and help you on your way even in the slightest."
depression,f9mgic8,t3_e5louu,1575457823.0,"Hey. I'm 22 and dealing with social anxiety myself. Though i've not quite overcome anxiety Im trying some things that seem to help. I too struggle with holding a conversation because im always overanalysing and anxious about replying. But I seem to do fine while texting with others. Based on the quality of your post, it would seem to be so for you too. Try texting someone. Think about the difference between texting and an actual conversation and how you can transpose the texting mindset to real life conversations. What I usually do is imagine every sentence spoken by someone is a text. And I take my time to respond in a way that makes me feel good. Sure its only something I thought up and not based on actual science and i'm sure you'll still get flustered sometimes as do I. But that is normal in everyone. To get rid of anxious thoughts try looking up mindfulness. Also nicotine gum seems to help but i'm not sure. Best of luck to you dude. I pray we both come out of this."

Guitar,exhd00b,t1_exh58ou,1566301531.0,"Hello, I myself am 2 years into guitar. Anyways just want to say that timing is crucial in music. So if you want to learn guitar and play along with your favorite songs, practice with  a metronome. I'm not talking about speed. You can watch and practice on youtube. But first learn to play slowly and accurately according to the beat of the song. Speed will come by itself as you keep practicing. I rate myself as a semi-intermediate player but timing is something I regret not learning since even though I can play some difficult stuff by now without the song, I find it hard to maintain even basic rhythm while playing along with a song. So thats something crucial."
