I remember one quarter in my junior year of high school I had C's in pre-calc and my counselor wouldn't let me take AP calc because of it unless I proved to him I could take it. So for the last quarter of that year I stopped paying attention at all in class and only taught myself from videos and the textbook.

Sure maybe they have more things to brag about but that doesn't mean they are ""ahead"" as you put it. They're just doing different things than you at different times of their lives. In reality they also feel insecure about themselves in many ways just like you. You can still feel happy with yourself even if it seems like you're doing nothing with your life.

I do the best with her but I feel I don't enjoy playing her idk why. Maybe it's because I feel so privileged or maybe it's just her playstyle that isn't fun. I enjoy the melee side of things where characters can play aggressive, have explosive combos and advantage states, and are generally fast in the air. Lucina is floaty, has to play passive (as my roommate and i would say, ""plays like a bitch""),  and her combos are always 2, maybe 3 hits long. She's just neutral the character. 

I've recently tried picking up roy as he's similar to lucina but is fast, plays aggressively, has explosive combos and advantage states, and on top of that takes a decent amount of skill to play. Things like sour spots into sweet spots and rars make him challenging and spices up the gameplay of ultimate.

My roommate who's one of if not my best friend since kindergarten is around the same level as me in ultimate and we play all the time. He's always somewhat ahead of me, and always wins more than me. I start to get really frustrated snd anxious when I haven't won a game in a while because it makes me feel so stupid for falling into the same traps he sets up for me with his conditioning and adaptation. It sucks so much because of how serious i take smash and how much I care when I lose. 

I feel exactly the same about my playstyle, I've played lucina since the game came out and have always felt guilty for playing a character whom i can just mash with and do good and not actually play the game ""legit"" as you would say. I try picking up characters with more skill and just get so mad at myself for getting so anxious and messing up with them a lot. 

I've been trying so hard to get over this for so long I really hope that I can. I really want to enjoy smash like I used to. Losing resurfaces all these insecurities and issues I have with depression, anxiety, ADHD, and more. It makes me hate myself so much. I know it's all in my head but I can't just flip the switch to make it so I don't get anxious when playing against someone better than me and so I can just play without wanting to die."
CrazyHand,fkr24g7,t3_fk27md,1584460350.0,"Playing against a CPU really isn't the best way to learn. In fact it might make you worse. The level 9 CPU reads your inputs and can react instantaneously to them (i.e. as soon as you press the button whereas a human needs a couple frames to react) which makes it hard to play any sort of punish game on them and could bring about publishable habits in your gameplay. If you don'r want to face humans yet, just play classic mode or adventure mode or something only to get used to the controls and learn how characters work and which ones you may like to learn.

tl;dr 
Playing the CPU is really only good for practicing combos and tech one already knows. You won't learn much from a match with them. Practice practice practice and keep playing people. Maybe switch to playing battle arenas as it's harder to get tilted in those as opposed to qp."

It's more about deciding when to make aggressive plays that support your teammates and when to just keep them alive and also, who to keep alive.

Of course it's always good to make sure you can keep yourself alive. Sometimes it's not poor aim or supportive decision making that's the problem but however long you're dead and not able to heal or support your team. If you survive longer you will of course do more healing and be of substantially more benefit to your team.

Also nade is arguably the best non-ultimate support ability in the game because it essentially makes it a 6v4 for a couple seconds which is more than enough to capitalize on and can make or break games. Nade is definitely a better offensive option than it is a defensive option so keep doing what you're doing by using nade aggressively.

Just remember, the role is called ""support"" and not ""healer"" for a reason."

I started branching off to other characters which I all sucked at, specifically fox as his playstyle is very different from Lucina's. I have now come back to lucina after switching around so much and I feel a lot more confident on her. I actually go off with her now. Here's what I have to say about her.

She's really easy to play starting out the game. People may say she's braindead and she kinda is but don't let that stop you from playing her. She has a really high skill ceiling and can be harder to play at higher levels. I will however heavily suggest playing different characters that don't have the same privileges as lucina as learning how to succeed with their playstyles not only deepens your understanding of the game and different playstyles but will improve your lucina immensely, especially if you try learning a character without a disjoint or low end lag on moves.

tl;dr
Lucina is easy to pick up but yes you are right she is hard to master and I feel picking up other characters who aren't as good as her will help you improve as a player and a lucina main."

Emotional dysregulation is also a part of ADHD so unfortunately we will just get low sometimes no matter what. But I've been learning many ways to control my emotions. You're better than your emotions, they cannot control you forever. Only reason they do is because you let them."

mentalhealth,fca740v,t3_egqmeg,1577564039.0,"This sounds like me. I feel stuck like you. I try so hard and so many things to improve myself, and while I do see improvement it  gets to me at times. Today I've been feeling quite depressed despite any effort I make to cheer myself up. I really want to improve my self esteem. I feel like it's so low so often. With each passing day I notice some other quality or trait of myself that is indirectly/directly caused by my low self esteem. I really just want to be able to accept myself and love myself but it's so hard to when I fuck up so many things. I always feel the need to beat myself up after any mistake I make. I know I just need to forgive myself but it seems so trivial to when I keep fucking things up. 

I just feel so afraid of so many things. My emotions have so much control over me. I feel so mentally weak that I'm too ashamed to talk to the people I've known my whole life. When I'm with my friends I say nothing. I'm not even there. It's like I'm invisible. All because I'm too afraid to express myself. I'm stuck in my own head unable to see the world around me in clarity. I keep getting pushed back into wallowing in my own self pity. Even that I can't do anymore because I feel so guilty for doing so. I shouldn't just have to feel like the world is a terrible place and that I don't deserve anything. But I do. Everyday. I feel your pain.

I want so much to be better than this. I hope you can become better too. Even If I can't convince myself that I can become better than this, I know I can, and I know you can too."
depression,fc4cyqi,t3_efyemj,1577413075.0,"Depression doesn't cause you to stop caring for yourself, rather it's low self esteem that causes depression. If you hate yourself, well of course your body and brain wouldn't care to treat you well, because you're someone it hates.

If you have anxiety issues as well, low self esteem is also the root of this. It makes sense to be scared of things when you doubt your own ability to deal with them. If you think you yourself are not good enough then you will feel anxious, and then as a result, depressed.

Most mental health issues are rooted in low self esteem. While I am still going through anxiety and depression myself, I am glad to say that I have been making huge strides in improving my self esteem, which in turn is helping reduce my anxiety and depression. 

The best way to start imho, is meditation, legit. It will calm you down and allow you to look at your thoughts in a neutral light, really analyze them, why they are there, how they make you feel and why, then coming to terms with them, and acceptance of said thoughts. 

It's hard to get out of the dark thick ocean that is depression, but you *can* do it, while it's not as simple as ""get over it"" it is more simple than you think. It will take a lot of effort but is by no means impossible or very difficult. I honestly hope this post at least opens your eyes a little. If you're down to chat about this my dms are open. Hope this helps."
