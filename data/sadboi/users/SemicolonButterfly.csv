Things kept (and keep) crumbling though. I felt sad and lost and empty no matter how ‘successful’ I was. Achievement was my drug of choice but my tolerance was ever increasing. Eventually I had to face the reality that making my outside world look good will never make me feel content or whole on the inside. So I really relate to what you’re saying about living a half life and feeling the toll this takes on everything - mind, body, and spirit - yet still finding that seeing this is, by itself, insufficient to break the cycle.

Choosing to engage in restrictive eating can certainly be something that jump-starts an ED. It varies a lot person to person because at the core it's a mental illness, not a physical one.

Only a qualified medical professional can really give you the answers you seek, but you can look at diagnostic features of the currently recognized EDs over at the National Eating Disorder Association website and see what does or doesn't resonate for you.

As a teenager, anorexia was at the forefront, but then I had a long period of ED recovery and a significant worsening of the other issues. At this point my ED thoughts/behaviors seem to be mostly a manifestation of the other issues (yay maladaptive coping). The stress/uncertainty/changes coming out of this COVID-19 situation have really worsened my overall mental health symptoms, and the desire to go back to my ED and SH behaviors is super strong. Hence, ya know...being on here again.

And yeah, people often unwittingly say very unhelpful things even when they mean well. I think it's hard for them to understand how these destructive behaviors started because in their own strange way, they genuinely offered relief. They've been a security blanket, albeit a scratchy one. With all my maladaptive behaviors though, eventually the consequences mount and I'm forced to look at whether they actually offer any chance for me to get where I want to be. For me the primary thing with the ED behaviors is they leave me with little energy or mental capacity to engage in the activities that help manage my depression. It's just hard to acknowledge the harm when in the short term I like the effects.

As you say, it's extra hard when it feels like the overall situation isn't even that much better in ED recovery because many other challenges remain. I'm trying to focus on how being away from ED behaviors is a step toward the overall solution and it gives all the other interventions a better chance of helping.

Hunger is the desire for food and the body's signals that it needs food, whereas appetite is the desire to satisfy that need. So it's possible to have hunger without appetite.

Though 'lack of appetite' still doesn't really capture my experience? That seems to imply I just have a reduced desire to meet my needs but for me it's often an active desire to NOT meet the need, and that feels subtly different somehow. Ah language. I love it deeply, but it so often falls short."

From an outside perspective it looks like ""Why are you using X in response to Y when X doesn't solve Y?""

Feelings about my body were in the mix, but they weren’t the only driving force, and those negative feelings about my body came about without anyone directly criticizing my physical form.

I liken it to how when you start to really clean and organize a messy room, it tends to get way messier before things are really put to rights. Of course, there are also considerations of finding a therapist that’s a good fit for you and your needs in terms of both personality and expertise. There are also quite a few different types of therapy and it can take a little time to discover what will be most effective for you.

And that new person connected me to DBT which has been the best fit for me so far and has helped a lot.)


I’ve seen a few reasons for why I had the worse-before-better arc:
- Like you, I waited a long time to ask for help. Actually talking about the things I had been dealing with for so long and hearing those words out loud with another person, that was an overwhelming experience. I was swamped with emotions and a new sense of just how dark things had gotten.
- Seeking help is stressful. How do I deal with stress? Yup. With the exact thing I’m seeking help for.
- Destructive instincts often aren’t very happy at our taking a close look at them. They start screaming even louder than usual when we’re thinking about firing them as the boss of our universe.


Your concerns are valid and important, and would probably be great things to bring up at your next appointment. I hope the therapist will listen and have helpful suggestions.

One benefit is that depending on your ED symptoms and experiences there can be meds that would be indicated or contraindicated. For example, some meds help some people with obsessive thoughts while other meds can have a higher risk of dangerous side effects in people dealing with restriction and/or purging (lookin’ at you Wellbutrin). Sometimes talking about what’s going on mentally and emotionally helps them fit the pieces together of what’s going on for you overall and what modes of treatment might be worth looking into. It’s fairly common for EDs to co-exist with other mental health issues, and identifying that can gradually provide some clarity about how to move forward.


Sometimes I’m in a healthier mindset about disclosing what’s going on with me than other times, so I try to take advantage of my more willing moments to get things on the table (even though future destructive me sometimes throws a fit).

fuckeatingdisorders,fg6149k,t3_ex0rqr,1580548160.0,"I think the all-or-nothing cognitions that are such a common experience among folks dealing with EDs, there can be feelings of ""Either I'm thin or I'm fat."" As if those are the only possible states. The cultural messaging from society at large doesn't really contradict that, so it's an especially tough belief to break out of. 

Looking at the feelings and needs and beliefs underpinning my disordered behaviors has been (and is) so hard/uncomfortable/scary for me, but it's also proving incredibly helpful. I'm starting to see how I set up my reality as a place where I could never possibly feel like ""enough"", and never feel content, and in seeing that I can start to change the rules."
EDAnonymous,fg60b9j,t3_ex1c35,1580547010.0,"Meeeeeeee. At my HW I *swore* that when I got back to X lbs. I would remember that I'm. Not. Fat. I would appreciate my body. I would be content in my body.

Well, I'm (X-5) lbs and while I logically know I'm not objectively fat, I *feel* fat. I feel distressed by my body. I feel angry and sad at the mirror me."
EDAnonymous,fg5zyyg,t3_ex2xoo,1580546518.0,"Certainly constipation can be extremely uncomfortable and even become medically serious, so it's understandable you want a solution! Is it something you've been able to talk with your doctor about to get their recommendations? Just be aware that the 'laxative teas' basically are...laxatives? I mean, they usually contain senna which is a natural laxative. It irritates your colon, forcing the muscle to contract. So, it's something to be careful with as with any stimulant laxative (which it sounds like you are).

If you decide to try it, my suggestion would be to steep the tea for even less time than the box suggests, just to see how your body reacts. I tried a senna tea once when I was desperate and it caused a lot (a lot) ((a lot)) of pain for me, but I don't know how common a reaction that is. It was certainly effective in getting my colon unstopped! Best of luck as your body finds it's way back to equilibrium <3"
EDAnonymous,fg37kmg,t3_ewmujx,1580473419.0,"It’s funny because my brain only feels safe when foods have ‘enough’ protein per 100 kcal. Probably because my dad was just obsessed with “Did you get enough protein? How much protein have you had? You need more protein!” From the little bit I know, protein is important in large part because it contains the amino acids our bodies need for building. Cells are constantly dying off and being replaced, so in effect we’re always under construction even when we’re not growing per se.


Getting some fat is important to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. (And probably lots of other stuff I don’t know about.) The caloric density can be scary, but many people find fats help them feel fuller for longer.


Carbs can offer great stuff too though! I really don’t think they deserve to be vilified. Just like fat didn’t deserve to be vilified a decade ago. There are some super crappy highly processed foods out there, but that’s not the fault of carbohydrates or fats. If the carbs you’re eating feel good, that’s a good thing. Maybe just try to ease into finding some sources of protein and fat that also feel good to you."

It’s understandable to freak out. I think the lack of choice in those situations bothers my brain too. Maybe try to remember that in the scheme of things those life-saving calories are a wash from a weight standpoint? Glad you were able to get help and I hope it’s not an experience you’ll have to repeat!"
EDAnonymous,fg2bvrb,t3_ewh15i,1580442103.0,"I thought throwing up was a not-all-that-common adverse reaction to a salt water flush? My understanding is they’re meant to induce diarrhea (and at that point the body has already snagged the nutrients it wanted). You’re basically just screwing with your body’s electrolyte management system, which is certainly not risk-free, and any weight change is mostly going to be water and poo."
fuckeatingdisorders,fg1n8gz,t3_ewf869,1580430167.0,"Fwiw, here’s a few sort of asterisk-type considerations...


- Unless you’re on total bed rest, your body uses a decent bit more energy than BMR. That’s why a multiplier based on activity level is applied to arrive at an estimate of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). That’s your maintenance energy.
- I don’t know how accurate the adult BMR equation is for folks under 18
- Many equations have been proposed for BMR, sometimes they differ by 100-200 kcal (!) I hate how they’re such alluring and specific equations but ultimately all approximations.
- The ballpark number I’ve seen used most commonly to estimate a 1 lb change in weight is 3,500 kcal. So, eating 200 extra calories a day would (theoretically) be  a 1 lb gain every 2.5 weeks.


I (shocker) kinda obsess over calorie math, though I do also genuinely find the science/math and research interesting."
EDAnonymous,fg1jvi5,t3_ewdz2z,1580428419.0,"Our outer appearance and inner experience often don't match up. It's hard when people assume we're doing great because we look good or our exterior lives look 'fine', when in reality we're locked in a daily struggle to withstand the pain of consciousness.

I'm sorry things have been so difficult and painful. Being in the place of wanting and trying to die was an excruciating period of time for me. I 100% did not expect to make it out alive. I was so fortunate that my community had pretty good resources to offer, and that a couple people were willing to stay in my life even as I became a multi-year tornado of anguished destruction. I hope that if you reach out a hand for help, that people will reach back toward you and help you find what you need. <3"
EDAnonymous,fg1g1hp,t3_ewdeh1,1580426443.0,"It often takes some time for weight changes to show up on the scale, just because daily fluctuations in water etc. can ‘hide’ the actual weight change in the short term. It can be super frustrating and upsetting. <3 The inability to truly *know* what’s going on is really hard for me to deal with. Awhile back I was going batty b/c >!after a 4 day fast my scale number had only dropped 0.2 lbs.!< I was somewhere between intense sadness and emotional shut down. That became a big part of why I’ve managed to reduce my weigh-ins."
