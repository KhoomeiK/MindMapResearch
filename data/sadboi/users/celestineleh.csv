angel was a similar story. she was held in the back of a petmart and was about to be ""sent to another location"" (probably euthanized). they told me she wasnt friendly and already having experience with clementine, they gave her away to me. she was luckily much healthier and has opened up since we got her. she was also geckonapped since we never paid for her lmao. 

i also had a gecko named valkyrie. she passed away due to a ton of congenital defects. she was from a local shop (in their defense, there was no way to tell about her issue). she was much friendlier but passed away about two years ago. 

i love my leos so much and theyve taught me a lot. theyre not the friendliest but they make me so happy. when i see them drinking water or climbing around on their hides, i feel so happy knowing that theyre safe.

their fins are up to 90% of the length of their body
the first record of them is from 1907 but the specimine was so damaged that little information was found
the first visual record dates back to 1988 when one was discovered off the northern coast of brazil at 4,375 m deep. then again in 1992 off the coast of ghana at 3010 m deep. they have also been found in senegal, mauritius, the gulf of mexico, the rodrigues island area, and at atwater valley, gulf of mexico. 
there was lots of media attention around a 2001 sighting of one on o’ahu hawaii at a depth of 3380 m
these horrible guys drag their terrible long apendages across the depths of the sea floor and just pick up what they can and eat it

ethicalfashion,f8takyn,t3_e1urxn,1574799364.0,"i personally consider it to be a more ethical company. to my knowledge, they pay employees fair wages and are compensated adequately, but then again i dont work there so i dont have insider knowledge. the seller fees are really low so shops are actually able to make a good profit. the recently started offsetting carbon emissions too! its a great outlet for supporting small and local businesses as opposed to terrible and highly unethical companies like amazon. *however* the ethicality of a seller/company is hard to assure. one issue i find as an oddities and taxidermy enthusiast is the plethora of unethically harvested animals. theres also a lot of drop shipping companies. if you see the same product over and over, chances are its cheaply mass produced by workers being paid unlivable wages. do your research through shop reviews and if youre really curious you can message the shop owner for info on where they source their products.
