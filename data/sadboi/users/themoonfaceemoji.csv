yorku,fpszfum,t1_fpsj1q6,1588882230.0,"Exactly!!! And we need to be prepared that there’s a chance there would be a strike in a next year or the year later, because these fucking strikes never stops. And we are being yorked really hard over and over again. Jesus I just want to graduate with peace."

brooklynninenine,foo9olz,t1_foecddf,1587935172.0,"But I do think it matched Rosa character. She is a strong independent woman. Plus I really do want to see TV show normalised people being single, because getting married or having a partner is not always a happy ending."
brooklynninenine,foo8z1m,t3_g7y394,1587934824.0,Rosa is my friend when I did something crazy and Amy is my mother when I did something crazy
brooklynninenine,foo8qip,t1_foo359z,1587934693.0,"Plus Holt has always been subtly petty and salty imo, I think this season just embraced his full on pettiness."
brooklynninenine,foo8i9p,t3_g8f4yr,1587934565.0,"There’s something weird about Rosa that I really couldn’t pin point. Less badass I guess??

For Amy, there’s def too much screaming and anger from her, which is very out of her character. 

Everyone is kinda weird in this season, but it wasn’t a bad season in general."
brooklynninenine,foo7wcf,t1_fon482d,1587934227.0,"Exactly!!! When I watch that episode I felt so annoyed!!! How could he do that to Jake while there’s no hard evidence, you know?"

Brilliant."

ptsd,fol7ouk,t1_fol3kgo,1587856513.0,"Hey hey hey, don’t compare yourself with each other. PTSD is not a competition. We all have our own problems and we react differently to harsh situation. Your PTSD is very valid and you need to take time to let yourself heal. You got this!!!"
ptsd,fokyp6k,t1_fokyf2t,1587851479.0,Thanks buddy! You hang in there too!
ptsd,fokyf8k,t1_fokw5jx,1587851327.0,"I would’ve reply (this is base on my real life experience), “I’ve seen so call hero soldiers like you kill and r*pe innocent people. And those blood that traumatised you might be someone important to me. You are not exclusive in this situation.” 

P.s.: I’m not saying Vet’s ptsd are not valid. It is two side story whenever war and violence is involved. Some of y’all did great stuff to protect your country and it’s totally understandable and I respect it. But if anyone scream at me like that and tell me my experience is different from their’s bc I didn’t serve, I will not hesitate to show you what we’ve been through in a military governmental regime."

ptsd,fokucy9,t1_foksyib,1587849115.0,"I feel like tone and attitude has some part in this situation. Because most people around me asked it in a dismissive gossipy judgemental tone, so that’s why I’m so frustrated. I feel like this could depend on the person. As you can see from this thread, some people are more open to talk about it and able to handle the questions, and some people are not, which either way are totally valid!"
ptsd,foktnyq,t1_fokmz6f,1587848737.0,Wait you can take meds for PTSD??? All I’ve been doing is take weed edibles!!!

ptsd,foksxae,t1_fojiqbx,1587848334.0,"Omg I’ve saw it somewhere people said (not to me), “how can you have PTSD while you’re not in the military?” 

And that’s how I know we need to put mental health as an education curriculum, because that’s just pure ignorance, and it’s 2020 we deserves better as we are progressing."
ptsd,fokre4u,t1_fokpz0s,1587847493.0,"I have a same question too! I really really don’t want to tell people I have PTSD, but sometimes I get triggered and the breakdown was very hard to hide or control. And I do feel bad for people who needs to witness or deal with that side of me. I know I’m not obligated to tell them anything, but I also don’t want them to see me as a freak, and I do feel like I need to explain. It’s so complicated, I wish there’s an easy answer."

You must be a very good friend to others!!!!"
ptsd,fok8ap2,t1_fojiru9,1587837262.0,I wish I have the strength to tell it. It’s just telling them I have PTSD is hard enough...

yorku,fianr9k,t3_f747oq,1582304835.0,"My advice would be hide your feelings, let yourself burn in pain for a week, go get high, go get drunk, go throw up and start fresh. That’s how I deal with all my crushes. Be subtle, and enjoy the time you have with her. I don’t think taking anther corse with her would be a bad idea, as long as you know how to control yourself.
