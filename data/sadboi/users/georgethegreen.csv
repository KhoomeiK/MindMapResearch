For instance the generic of cymbalta caused horrible panic attacks for me and my doctor at the time said it belongs to a class of medications that don’t typically help bipolar people. So along with some other things, that helped us reach my diagnosis. 

I personally like gabapentin as an anxiety med because it doesn’t make me drowsy, others I’ve tried have knocked me out. 
Lamictal is a tricky one to get used to but it’s worked for me for a long time when taken twice a day. I’ve noticed significant decreases in mood swings than when I’m off of it.

BipolarReddit,fgfv0xp,t3_ey5trs,1580748220.0,"That’s a pretty big mood. My sex drive is very high the majority of the time and I’ve never had a therapist or doctor that I was comfortable enough to talk about it with, even though they’re professionals. I suspect that’s leftover shame from my super religious upbringing. And the stigma of women not being allowed by society to own their sexuality. They know im sexually active and I get tested, the hpv vaccine, pap smears etc. to at least make sure I’m healthy.

Personally meds don’t affect my sex drive much, at least they keep it manageable but still high if I’m not having a manic or hypomanic episode. When I’ve been on birth control to tame my periods that did help some because again I was more emotionally stable. I’ve learned to just masturbate or distract myself. Being a lesbian makes the dating thing very difficult and I’m not one for casual sex (usually, there are times I’ve been desperate enough for it) so I’m used to taking care of myself solo. Toys help, trying new methods helps, but nothing is the same as partner sex unfortunately. Then there’s the many times where I can’t just go get myself off in everyday life and that’s when I just have to distract myself. Say I’m at work and I see a gorgeous woman who leaves me dripping wet, I can’t just drop everything and go to the bathroom to take care of it. I just try to zone into what I’m doing until the urges pass. Or I text my best friend who laughs at how thirsty I am. At home, I’m definitely guilty of getting distracted and letting my “me time” get in the way of otherwise being productive. There’s not really a solution here. Stay strong and I’m glad you’re able to reach out to a community on here. Don’t hesitate because we bipolar internet strangers get it too and also need the support."

Condoms are mostly used to prevent pregnancy so I think that’s why they get more focus and are more widely available, even though the disease protection part is very important. Other people have mentioned that they become more common as a result of campaigning after the aids epidemic. 

It’s also been pointed out that you can easily adapt one into a dental dam. Regardless of your sexual orientation, having condoms widely available is better for society when it comes to disease prevention and unwanted pregnancies."
