patientgamers,fniq871,t3_g1ktto,1586984435.0,I feel like Subnautica is a perfect example of a game that couldn't work nearly as well if it were made in any other medium. Sensations of terror when you hear a roar in the distance or relief when you make it back to your base come so naturally since you're experiencing that ocean first hand. Also just the intrinsic reward of finally finding out what's off in the distance or down in that cave is so much more meaningful when you had to get past your own fear to do it. One of my favorite games ever.
