Parenting,fq91d8b,t1_fq90czs,1589182130.0,"Yeah ofcourse it's super scary, but fear for abortion should not be the driving force of having/raising a child. 
If you hadn't gotten pregnant would you imagine yourself raising a kid? At this age specifically that's a tough decision. 

I think a great next step for you is to talk to a professional in the field about what your options are, you could also opt for adoption but there will still be a living being on this Earth that will forever be connected to you. 

Whatever decision you are going to make has to be yours, no one should push you one way or the other. 

You've mentioned legal issues but I don't think anyone would force you to raise a child you won't feel comfortable raising."
Parenting,fq8zdk5,t3_ghi8n9,1589180214.0,"I was 16 when I became pregnant myself. I was surrounded by pretty religious people, so much so that the word abortion was never spoken out loud. I'm 24 now and still not able to care for my daughter full-time. I'm not gonna tell you what to do, just make sure you know what it means to be a parent if that's what you're going to decide. Because I sure didn't know what I was getting into. you're only 15, you still have so much developing to do as a person yourself. 

If you want to talk a little or have some questions don't hesitate to dm me"

I was like: I just wanna wake up happy and excited to start the day. His answer? I don't think that's a realistic obtainable goal looking at your history. 

Thanks for the pep talk doc"

You could compare it to an tiny attic or something, just a place to put stuff you don't need everyday. You didn't put up a shrine with pictures of dead animals decorated with blood paintings or something else creepy/out of the ordinary, just basic storage clutter.
