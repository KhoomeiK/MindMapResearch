depression,f9lcohn,t3_e5i6vs,1575419862.0,"Yes. It just reminds me of disappointment, anxiousness, and regret. I hate this time of the year with all my being."

depression,f9lbavy,t3_e5louu,1575418906.0,"I guess look for someone who shares your interests? I know it’s hard to find someone who’s open about embarrassing interests (ie. anime, video games, etc.), if you have any, but you just gotta keep looking. I know I’ve been looking for years too and messed up the only shot I had at a good gf my first year in college but I want to think it’s never too late for me so the same can be true for anyone."
depression,f9laufg,t3_dsgdf3,1575418589.0,I can’t fall asleep until 4am because I watch romance anime and feel like shit. Also I’m a straight guy and I honestly don’t know why I watch it so much but I keep coming back to it.
kratom,f26gptu,t3_dc2xb3,1570009457.0,I have had the same issue with two major kratom companies where I would get incredibly sick from taking the same dose I have been taking for years (10g or 20 capsules) and when I tried to take even lower doses I would still get super dizzy where I would unable to stand. I’ve been trying to find information about why this keeps happening. Maybe some sketchy shit is happening in Malaysia where they messing with the plants. I don’t know for sure but it’s happened to me twice where I had to throw away $70 worth of kratom each time.

MobiusFF,f0upyb7,t1_f0t60p1,1568947354.0,Do you know where I can check that? I just got my first supreme card from the 8 free summon reparation thing (woo) so I can imagine it’s probably pretty low right now if that counts
MobiusFF,f0t4mvr,t1_eyycp18,1568915836.0,So when an EX job makes it debut it has a higher chance of being pulled?
MobiusFF,f0t40e4,t1_eyt1xrt,1568915543.0,So I should not use my cards for the job specific supreme summon that’s coming up?

raidsecrets,ev8hp8f,t3_ceib6m,1564279916.0,wheres my ramen coupon gang at?
raidsecrets,ev8gu3z,t1_euhwu5m,1564279174.0,solo clear for emblem
raidsecrets,ev8grmi,t1_euh5aa0,1564279114.0,"it will probably include achievements and emblems like in the last 2 dungeons (solo run in shattered throne, timed trial for outbreak). Since its also a huge expansion i would assume there would be a title associated with it (since titles are relatively new and a dungeon title just seems like an obvious game element at this point) and multiple lore pieces to be found in it as well."

DestinyLore,eu2ojuz,t3_cehw38,1563394657.0,"Charles, because it would sound cool whenever Zavala would say it."

DestinyLore,eu2n3nw,t1_etamqtg,1563393755.0,"We have one lore entry from Val Ca'our under the Emperor's Envy fusion rifle where he literally calls Calus a son of a bitch lol... ""Calus. That conniving coward, spawn of a war beast."" So its safe to assume anyone from the Red Army does not have a positive opinion of Calus."
DestinyLore,eu2mdtc,t1_etvc0fb,1563393314.0,"If we're ever given a choice to take the side of the vanguard or Calus...I think its a very likely possibility to have PVP enabled zones against factions if we're to take the end of the chronicon seriously where the ""Shadow of Shadows"" ie. Us as guardians, will slaughter the entire vanguard and destroy the city."

DestinyLore,etuv2ba,t3_cdgowx,1563220576.0,"Im not sure if the City has an established class system, especially since the human species is on the brink of extinction. But thats just my opinion."
DestinyLore,etusxcu,t3_cdejz5,1563219345.0,I hope so. It would make a interesting gameplay mechanic in patrol zones where you can kill guardians of other factions.
DestinyLore,etusq5u,t1_etuhzld,1563219225.0,"instead of a time jump forward, I would like to see a prequel where we actually get to play in all the badass stories we read about in D1 grimoire."
DestinyLore,eturz9t,t1_etueudo,1563218791.0,I dont think anyone who plays the game semi seriously wants there to be a D3 outside of D2
DestinyLore,eturql3,t3_cdhhkt,1563218655.0,"Hopefully they dont make the mistake of deleting thousands of hours of grinding like they did in the transition from D1 to D2. I hope they just keep D2 and keep building off of that. Make old armor and weapons unusable with a ""D3 update,"" but in D2 and having events to power your old weapons and armor up would be a good move imo."
DestinyLore,etakxnj,t1_equxnlr,1562622648.0,"What if the darkness can convert us like the Vex? Like we reach a stalemate between the light and dark (since one cannot exist without the other) and the dark offers us a choice to join them or be locked in perpetual combat for all eternity since the traveler is (presumably) crippled by Ghaul and Rasputin and, therefore unable to run like it has before. I also don’t think Calus is a “god” in the traditional sense but he was a great leader (at least in his own mind) so he could be easily swayed by something as omnipotent as the Darkness."
