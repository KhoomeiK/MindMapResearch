bipolar,fopi7cr,t3_g8rr7n,1587962153.0,If I could upvote this 1000 times I would. But I guess that’s overupvoting. Dangit!!
bipolar,folj3ye,t1_folg6iq,1587863330.0,"Heya!

First of all: I didn’t know there was a sequel to the electric slide. :)

Second and happily, I’m not considering switching from Lithium at all. Its like this whole interpretative subsystem suddenly switched off, and I’m more me than I’ve been in decades. It’s unreal.

I asked my wife if she’d still love me if I had hook hands, and she said yes. Ha! So I guess I’m good.

I’m sorry about the migraines. You’re right, this is crazy great.  I’ll run that google search now.

Thanks so much!"

creepyPMs,foadtsg,t3_g6igyr,1587645043.0,I’d totally read a compilation of responses to this tactic. Love it.
bipolar,fmynxcy,t1_fmrd7id,1586490845.0,"I’m on Lithium Carbonate and Lamictal. Lamictal actually predates this diagnosis.

Thanks for the info!"
bipolar,fmr4v7f,t1_fmqi5or,1586313926.0,Interesting. What’s the name of one? I appreciate your sharing your thoughts.

bipolar,fmjzx6x,t1_fmh593r,1586141255.0,Super appreciate this. I’m going to follow my doc’s lead and trust that I don’t know shit about this yet.

bipolar,fmivrcw,t1_fmis1di,1586117904.0,"Dude, love this. The good thing for me is that I feel no shame or anything as an alcoholic, I get that physical shit can have mental symptoms.

I had an episode and drove 550 miles to Las Vegas without any real plan. During a pandemic. 

That was the last straw."
bipolar,fmio4o9,t3_fv8ef0,1586113478.0,I’m both scared and excited.  I don’t know if my marriage will sustain this though.

bipolar,fminzv6,t1_fmh5yvl,1586113399.0,"Really good thoughts, thank you. 

I have a bunch of friends with conditions that meds  help with, and I’ve seen what “I’m good, I don’t need this anymore” does.  Totally with you.

I’m also an alcoholic (sober for 18 years), and I did the same thing when I had 7 years the first time. I thought I was good, and could drink again. Boy, was I wrong."
bipolar,fminte6,t3_fv8ef0,1586113294.0,Will so. I’m also getting off a bunch of incorrect stuff.

pcmasterrace,feces4n,t1_fecaygp,1578972193.0,"That makes sense.  I figure I have a decent case that came with the CyberPower... so maybe I’ll upgrade the CPU and MB now, since I’m hoping to upgrade the CPU and GPU when I can afford it. I have a low-end Ryzen 5 and a Radeon RX 580, which are both solid for what I do, but won’t be for that much longer if I want to games to stay at near-max gorgeous."

Not saying the number of Chinese deaths doesn’t matter - of course it does - just putting into context that you’d have to kill 100’s of millions of  Chinese people to get as closed to eliminating all of the Jews as the Nazi’s did."
