For other DAWS you could always export your Midi parts and then import them into software like Finale or Sibelius and then add dynamics marking as well as any other detail that needs to be included in the sheet music. That’s how I’ve been doing it for whenever I need to turn in sheet music to something I’ve written).

Just remember to double check your notation since sometimes the midi to notated music conversion doesn’t go as smoothly"

Berklee,fmrh1qa,t1_fm89b2q,1586322967.0,This is a rating you get when you first start classes. It’s supposed to dictate which ensembles you can place into. (But honestly you can audition for most stuff if you ask whichever professor leads the ensemble)
Berklee,fmrgtzw,t3_fpdn9e,1586322788.0,When I came in I got 3’s across the board. Honestly never bothered to re-audition for better ratings. But honestly it came to mean nothing in the long run
Berklee,fmrgm7f,t3_fs9vy4,1586322606.0,"Hey! I’m a current student and I can give you a little peek into what my classes are like. 
I usually have about 5-Ish hours of classes a day... but they’re spread out throughout the day. 
This isn’t taking into account the time I spend doing work OUTSIDE of class (which is IMO what will take up a good chunk of your time). 

For example last semester I had to attend recording/mixing sessions at the studios that I had to book late at night/somewhat early. (for me these last anywhere from 2-5 hours approx.) as well as weekly rehearsals with my band. Hope this helps! Feel free to shoot me a pm if there’s something else you wanna ask!"
