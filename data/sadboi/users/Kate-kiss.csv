For other DAWS you could always export your Midi parts and then import them into software like Finale or Sibelius and then add dynamics marking as well as any other detail that needs to be included in the sheet music. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been doing it for whenever I need to turn in sheet music to something I‚Äôve written).

I usually have about 5-Ish hours of classes a day... but they‚Äôre spread out throughout the day. 
This isn‚Äôt taking into account the time I spend doing work OUTSIDE of class (which is IMO what will take up a good chunk of your time). 

For example last semester I had to attend recording/mixing sessions at the studios that I had to book late at night/somewhat early. (for me these last anywhere from 2-5 hours approx.) as well as weekly rehearsals with my band. Hope this helps! Feel free to shoot me a pm if there‚Äôs something else you wanna ask!"
