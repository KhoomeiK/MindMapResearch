This could be their darker, more adult series, but without any sex (it’s still Star Wars) and still light on gore. The Mandalorian had more realistic gunfire and explosions. If you follow the officers you hardly need to see blood. They could also follow Canderous, Atton, and Bao-Dur to get a more complete story but not follow them into the goriest parts. The atrocities could all be seen by the Generals from orbiting ships above.

Revan is perhaps too morally ambiguous a main character for a Disney series, but maybe Meetra could be the narrator character, as arguably the unfallen character who knew the old Revan best, even if the real focus of the story is Revan."

It could span a huge amount of time from the earliest skirmishes on the Outer Rim while Revan and Alek and Meetra are still in training to right up until the events of KOTOR. There should be a lot of emphasis on Revan and Alek's friendship. Maybe it could even cover KOTOR if the emphasis is a lot less on the nonexistent surprise and a lot more on what elements of Revan's personality come through the mindwipe and the implications for redemption of fallen Jedi in general. A lot more could be made of the moral luck of Revan being saved and Malak not, even though Revan led Malak to evil. The romance with Bastila could be much more of a meal, and the viewer could be fully let in to her conflict over indulging a romance at all, let alone with Revan. I like Revan defying the Council to marry Bastila, so we know he's still got a mind of his own, but I don't like any of the canon stuff about Revan after this point, so afaic it could end here."

Masturbation isn’t forbidden for me rn, but being on lockdown could definitely lead me back into addiction. I’ve been really appreciating all the restless sexual energy in “hands-free mode,” so to speak. I just try to feel the sexual energy without reacting to it with actions (masturbating, trying to get my husband to have sex right this minute) or thoughts (porny scenarios that try to bring it to a head). Just letting it be. It feels amazing— sexual, but not lustful. I get really tense when I masturbate, which didn’t feel good and which I associate with shame and using it to numb. When I just feel the urge and the energy behind it, I relax into it and feel good afterwards. Sometimes I discover that my urges to masturbate weren’t coming from a place of sexual desire at all, but wanting to medicate anxiety or feelings of deficiency. Hands-free mode allows me to explore the difference between sexual energy and using masturbation to numb and distract from unpleasant feelings. I think it’s also good for me not to have such a scarcity mindset, treating every urge as something precious that must be satisfied. I feel like I have a more secure attachment with my sexuality when I don’t desperately answer every call."
