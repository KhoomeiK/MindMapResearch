BPD,fqqquxf,t1_fqqgs5f,1589570318.0,you really never want to be wrong huh? you’re definitely guilt tripping OP by saying Alex doesn’t want to control her emotions.

It’s not a word to be used lightly.
BPD,fqqddis,t1_fqo4g8u,1589563578.0,I disagree. you’re being condescending. Nothing about the post insinuated she wants Alex to “manage her emotions.” The issue is her feeling hated by him.

BPD,fpg6wcv,t1_fpg6l20,1588595914.0,There are just as great of odds of getting in an abusive relationship with a pwBPD as there are someone without BPD. You run that risk anytime you get involved with someone or date someone. So therefore he took the time to come on the BPD sub to let us know he correlates this disorder specifically with abuse. Unfair. I’ve dated enough people and not one of them has had BPD. I honestly feel like he had a bad experience with one BPD and decided to lump them all together. That’s just my assumption and can be true or false. I think two people with BPD dating is a huge risk. That’s only if their symptoms are severe or very prominent. However I don’t correlate it with toxicity or abuse and that’s because I’m not bitter or an asshole. I think we are going to agree to disagree. I’m sorry you both think pwBPD are so terrible.
BPD,fpg5k04,t1_fpg57hb,1588594863.0,"OP is literally and 100%  indirectly saying BPD = bad. So what is OP gonna do when the next person he dates happens to be abusive and doesn’t have BPD? Maybe he should date better people wtf. He is intentionally correlating BPD with abuse which isn’t okay. Being with a pwBPD doesn’t inherently mean it takes a lot of energy out of someone. They can be quiet, high functioning, with not severe symptoms. This post and your comment are the exact reason bpd has negative stigma around it. People I’m closest to were shocked when I told them I have BPD. BPD ruins my entire life, yet the people around me didn’t know? Hm, probably because not everyone with BPD is abusive nor is it obvious. It’s internal only for a lot of people lmao. But yeah I agree, therapy would be extremely helpful for OP."

nevillegoddardsp,fpfzjkt,t1_fpfycze,1588589346.0,"I get what you’re saying, but I disagree that love and fear can’t coexist? They’re both very normal and natural feelings. At some point you’re going to feel both and that shouldn’t mean everything turns to shambles. It’s really unfair to tell people they can have one or the other. I’m sure people have manifested SP’s while having fear and I’m sure people who are in love have fears. LOA tells people to act in such a certain way and it’s unnatural sometimes it seems :/"

Stalking,focywj2,t3_f8t433,1587677713.0,"First, I want to say I’m sorry you’re going through that. I have made the mistake of stalking someone before and I hope I can give you some insight. In my situation, it started out small and it seemed harmless, so it would slowly escalate and I didn’t immediately realize how much it had escalated. The person I stalked deeply hurt me emotionally and I knew that logically, stalking wasn’t going to solve anything. It was emotionally driven. I would stalk them and the people in their lives (mainly social media, one in person) to try to understand what makes them worthy of being in that person’s life and them not hurting the people. Why did they only hurt me? I think what couldve made me stop is it they gave me closure. A long conversation about everything so I can make peace with it. I always felt like they were above me, and like I was insignificant. If they treated me like normal, left things peacefully, and remained acquaintances, I don’t think I would’ve analyzed everything so deeply and been so emotionally scarred. I’m not blaming the person. So it depends honestly. Every situation is different.

Also, I want to add that eventually we did talk it out and the person forgave me. We ended up being on good terms and I didn’t feel the need to obsessively check up or stalk after that. The tension in the situation was gone. They knew I wasn’t a threat and wouldn’t cause harm, though. So it depends. Your safety comes first."
