DIY your lights. the markup on leds is incredible and, at least when I tried a grow a few years back before custom spectrum leds were a thing it was far far better value for money to build a basic metal rig, buy some heatsinks and whack on some vero 29s. If you have the know how to do that, or a bit of time to research, I highly recommend building your own lighting rig.

BPD,fp2c03e,t1_fp1uz00,1588259091.0,"Interesting stuff, I didn't know much about borderline subtypes, but I still believe the way quiet bpd is portrayed in contrast to apparent ""loud"" bpd is often not accurate. Going by the study someone else linked and what you just said, there are at least 3, or 4 going by Millon, possible subtypes of bpd, quiet and loud is only two and people speak about them as if they're completely different conditions. The core symptoms and suffering is the same. I maintain that it's far more nuanced than people ever admit and it's overgeneralised every time I see ppl bring it up to the point where I don't believe what people often say is ""quiet"" bpd actually necessarily accurately fits discouraged or another subtype perfectly, because it's not so simple considering the subtypes are only proposed. There's multiple models for what subtypes could even be a thing from what I've read.

anyway wasn't my intention to attack anybodys identity or whatever"
BPD,fp1rq7e,t1_fp1q7lb,1588245769.0,"Thanks that is an interesting read. Suggesting that bpd/eupd could potentially be split into 3 subtypes and it would certainly explain all the people who talk about suffering from a quiet variant of bpd. But all of these people equally fit the current criteria for bpd/eupd and would be diagnosed as such. It would be nice to see more studies and scientific publications on this stuff because it's far far more nuanced than any non-medical stuff I ever saw about ""quiet"" and ""loud"" bpd.

It's not so simple as splitting borderlines up between the icky loud ones and the quiet ones.

Here's the table of results from that study you posted. Interestingly, the subtype that you might expect to correlate with ""quiet"" (schizotypal/paranoid) possibly has the lowest reported rates of self harm, which does not correlate with how I often see articles portray quiet bpd.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494904/bin/40479\_2017\_66\_Fig2\_HTML.jpg](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494904/bin/40479_2017_66_Fig2_HTML.jpg)

It seems to me like quiet and loud borderline subtypes were just kind of made up by an, admittedly large, set of anecdotal reports. but not by scientific method, and for that reason the documentation/articles you see mentioning quiet/loud borderline specifically can often be inaccurate and misleading on a bunch of stuff. Making it seem like some symptoms are unique to quiet bpd that are actually not (internalising, increased self harm, avoidance) or that ""normal"" borderlines can never be reserved or as shameful as ""quiet"" ones. idk anyway just my thoughts"

I'd be interested to see some official documentation to tell me I'm wrong but I've done a bit of reading on this stuff and for some reasons I don't really buy into ""quiet"" bpd and kinda think it's harmful. I don't need or want to denigrate your identity since it's not a personal thing and I won't put my reasons for thinking this stuff forward since you probs don't wanna hear it.

have a good one"
BPD,fp1oo8f,t1_fp13lq1,1588242836.0,"Thing is I think with borderline we tend to have pretty high emotional intelligence because of how much emotion we experience and process, that makes it easy to unintentionally emotionally manipulate others like some kind of intuition/habit imo.

BPD,fp1obyk,t3_gadzsv,1588242496.0,"A couple of the symptoms you listed seem like symptoms of something other than bpd, not to belittle yours or anyone else's experience but the categorical list of criteria for a bpd/eupd diagnosis can be found in the ICD or DSM.

Some stuff you mentioned are things that may be part of your personality or part of another disorder, but not of borderline/eupd.

Anything more complex than the things written there are basically down to a psych to decide. I hope you're seeing someone and getting treatment because bpd is hard enough on its own, with another disorder stacked on top it's beyond difficult."
BPD,fp1o2e1,t3_gaoaxf,1588242230.0,"Leading people on ""for fun"" sounds like a resultant behaviour of a symptom of a personality disorder other than bpd. Sounds like something likely comorbid right?

but more specifically yes the symptoms of bpd can cause us to hurt other people, pretty much always for the sake of validation/attention, it's just the nature of borderline and our emotions. During times of extreme stress and emotion it can be easy to neglect how others might be feeling a little, it's also common to do this while also feeling great shame and guilt for doing it at the same time."

Even though it was a terrifying dream still I find stuff super interesting like how you just ""know"" things in your dream and they just make sense for no reason like irl you'd just freak out and be like ""wtf just happened"" but in dream when something that makes no sense happens you're just like ""okay cool"" and somehow explain it to urself idk"
mentalillness,fom1q9i,t3_g80z22,1587875935.0,"I have bizarre fucked up dreams probably about 50% of nights nowadays. I remember all my earliest super bizarre nightmares too, was having them from well before I was 16 y/o at a guess (24 now). Nightmares like legitimate horror movies, horrific creatures, weird alternate universes, me and family members dying in horrific ways, me getting tortured horrifically by old friends one by one.

I can have several in one night, especially if I keep trying to sleep after having one or two. Probably get them more often if I sleep during the day.

I think some dreams can have meaning for sure, but not like they're trying to tell you something. My interpretation is that dreams are just your brain trying to make sense of random sequences of neuron pathways that fire during your sleep. The more you have thought about something the stronger the neuron pathway. So for me personally I often find myself able to relate certain things in my dreams to things I feel extremely anxious about (ex: had one recently where I fell and lost all my teeth, when I'm awake I often think about how I hate the state of my teeth)

I'm super super lucky and glad I don't get any involving like rapey stuff but I had one where I was uhhhh, getting sexually treated in a way that made me super uncomfortable but that was only one time thankfully. Otherwise it just tends to be extremely vivid memorable but bizarre and hard to describe sequences of events. best way I could describe most of my dreams is like  being the protagonist of a psychological horror thriller movie lmao."

I think it's only unhealthy to use the phrase at all when a person is already self-destructive and uncaring about stuff in general or they ""indulging and encouraging"" it... in that case, it's a set of behaviours that should be discouraged and worked on rather than the simple use of the phrase ""fp"". I certainly don't encourage it, but I know that I have up until really recently ""indulged"" in those behaviours knowingly for my own reasons.

I do understand, but at the same time, it's just a label and idk if it's right to discourage someone from using the phrase without knowing all the nuance of a persons relationship.

[https://youtu.be/iLKTVvBjnsk](https://youtu.be/iLKTVvBjnsk) \- this dude speaking on it might help you see why it's such a specific thing that kind of deserves it's own label. and it's better than constantly having to remind ourselves ""oh yeah my unhealthy obsession person...""

Idk, again I get it but I just think we need words to identify unique circumstances. It's not the title that's possessive, it's the behaviours that precede it. Once you're at the point of that label you're already acting beyond possessive and fair and I think a lot of us know that."

selfharm,f9wp72g,t1_f9wk5yi,1575696388.0,"Perhaps you could ask for a different nurse or something? :/  Otherwise I wish you the best of luck no matter what, they're not going to section you or anything I'm sure, they can't and won't force you to attend outpatient appointments and stuff like that, you won't get sectioned for not attending them either unless they have really really strong evidence to believe that you might hurt yourself or somebody else (as in you straight up telling them that you will, in my experience).

Sadly, it's very very easy to get away from treatment especially as an adult, but I hope you make the right choice and maybe seek help elsewhere if you're not getting it where you are now. Good luck :(("

Honestly in my experience simply not attending appointments and not responding to attempts at contact got me discharged from mental health care faster than I'd have liked. Are you sure it's the best idea though?"
selfharm,f9waolu,t3_e6zwnu,1575689681.0,"Are you in the UK or elsewhere? I have acouple of UK experiences so I know I'm basically.

If you're being held on a section, no you can't discharge yourself. If you are not being held on a section and you're over 18 then you can leave whenever you want if you ask staff and give them the impression that you're stable enough. If they can't properly discharge you immediately then you can ask about ""authorised leave"". I wasn't under a section and they tried to keep me there even though they legally can't at that point unless they drop a 72 hour section on you, and they can only really do that if they have a good reason.

Other time was several years ago when I was under 18, tried to discharge myself but I had nowhere to live so they threatened me with a section if I tried because it simply wasn't safe, I had nowhere to go. But they discussed that with me and I avoided the section by agreeing to stay.

Hope this helps."

selfharm,f9w79uz,t3_e75zyz,1575688169.0,"I bath and to be honest I'm laying in bed after a night sweat rn worrying about the same thing. My arms are kind of fucked up and I know there isn't much way around it. I usually love to have scolding hot baths but I just can't do it when I have fresh cuts.

My advice is to keep the water as close to body temperature as possible, maybe slightly warmer(can test this by seeing if it feels warm or cold, the closer to feeling perfectly in the middle of warm and cold is closer to your body temp), and don't let it hit your wounds directly rather just run over them. Don't flinch too much and it gets easier :( 

Also can we note how it's kinda weird when it's not self inflicted pain it's a lot less bearable. Water on cuts seems pretty compared to actually causing the cuts.. and yet it burns like a mofo..."

selfharm,f9q18h1,t3_e6aq9b,1575553291.0,"Honestly really depends where it is and how wide it is. I have a handful like that on the outside of my forearm which basically healed up wide but flat. I have one on the inside of my forearm which healed kind of more raised because of how the skin bunches up when you bend your arm. It's a bit raised when I stretch my arm out, and becomes a lil scar flap when I bend my arm all the back (aka skin under less tension)."
