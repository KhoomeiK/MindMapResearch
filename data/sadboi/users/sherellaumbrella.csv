AskReddit,fn7obkr,t3_fzqjeo,1586724330.0,"This is such a good question! I came from a family/community that was very anti-gay. When I got to college and became an individual I started to wonder if I had been made to feel being gay was so wrong that If I were gay maybe I wouldn’t know (which is maybe weird, I don’t know). I obviously grew up and realized being gay wasn’t a bad thing. But yeah, I spent several years thinking maybe I could be. I like girls in a way- I think they’re beautiful and I would definitely kiss one, but I don’t really see myself being in a relationship with a female. I think that realization is how I knew. I think everyone can appreciate a good looking person and sexuality can be more gray than black and white. When you think about genuine connection, though, who do you find yourself with? And for me that’s men. Idk, just my opinion of course."

bipolar,exzv0fm,t3_co31tn,1566670959.0,I love this. I feel like it perfectly describes how I feel. I go through a lot of days happy and what I would describe as my “best self” and then I come home and it’s over. I’m a mess and nothing happened. Thank you to the artist and the one who posted it. ❤️
depression,ewhphsv,t1_ew0o6rd,1565416409.0,"Yes! I have taken several personality tests and I’m an extrovert but I also have severe depression. It’s like, I want to be around people and it does give me life but a lot of times my depression gets the best of me and I get overwhelmed and stressed out thinking about replying to someone."
depression,ewhp9wd,t3_cm28m0,1565416148.0,I also do this. I will have good days where I text everyone back and I’m thoughtful and I try really hard and other days where someone texts me or Facebook messages me and it stresses me out. I have avoided one person’s text for several months. I just kept putting it off and now I don’t think it would be acceptable to reply. So I get it!
