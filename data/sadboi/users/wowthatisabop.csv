In order to form a scientific theory one has to first form a hypothesis. After forming that hypothesis, you have to test it rigorously, (via observation, or through math, could be others but I can't think of any right now) and it has to be proven correct so many times that the scientific community agrees that the idea is solid enough to be named a theory.

Theories that are hard to understand have probably been proven with extremely complex math like quantum physics, or haven't yet been observed but many agree that it's plausible enough to be labeled a theory. That's my take on why astrology gets written off while scientific theories are seen as legitimate."

Depending on your playing level, the Concert and Contest collection for Bb clarinet edited by H. Voxman is a great book for shorter solos perfect for solo ensemble contests or just for fun.

Artistic Studies Book 1 - from the French School for clarinet, edited by David Hite contains a ton of studies, etudes and caprices arranged or written by Cyrille Rose. These can be more challenging, so I'd suggest looking at the book to see if you feel like you could benefit from it before buying it. Those three books are the main ones I use during my studies as a music ed major.

As for learning rhapsody in blue, I'd say the first step is getting some sheet music if you haven't already. Listen to many recordings and follow along with your music. When you find one you really like, try to replicate it. Really listen to what the player does and try to figure out why it's different from other recordings you didn't like. Play on your own and record it, then critique yourself. It's awkward at first, but the more you do it, the easier it gets. That's my favorite way to learn new pieces."
Clarinet,fok7tbb,t3_g7xfbp,1587837005.0,"First of all, I want to say that everyone progresses at their own rate. For some people, things just click, and others have to work a little harder. All of that is just fine, and you shouldn't beat yourself up over having less progress than you think.

It's awesome that you're starting to practice five days a week!! Just doing that and staying consistent with it will help you progress a ton. Tone can be affected by the instrument, so if you're really serious, you could look into a more advanced instrument. If that's out of your price range, a real good mouthpiece would change a lot.

Playing music you like and want to learn can help a lot. I've always felt better when I learn something I really like, and feel more motivated too. Learning Rhapsody in Blue is a great choice, because it opens your playing up to styles that are less classical, which can provide a fun challenge. 

Look up Earspasm Music on YouTube, or any other clarinet youtubers for suggestions on how to improve any aspect of your playing that you feel needs some practice. Scales and arpeggios are always a good idea (even though they can be boring).

TrueOffMyChest,focwoxd,t3_g6njbz,1587676870.0,"Yeah, I get what you mean. I'm totally accepting of people in the trans community, including non-binary and gender queer people, but I am not super interested in dating trans people myself. I've seen a lot of trans people say that they understand why people don't want to date them and aren't upset about it, and a lot say it's transphobic if you wouldn't date a trans person.

In the end, I'd say your feelings are valid. You have a right to date who you want and be attracted to whoever you're attracted to. As long as you aren't discriminating or hating on anyone, go enjoy yourself."
