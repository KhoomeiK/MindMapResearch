dataisbeautiful,fr1niz4,t1_fr1n6na,1589822793.0,"yes, I agree with that. but the speed you're traveling could very well have an affect on the human experience of time. we have not been able to measure that, as it's kinda arbitrary to the person measuring, at least for everything we've been able to test (it's a difference of thousandths of a second, not hours)"
dataisbeautiful,fr1mtjs,t1_fr1m9ga,1589822444.0,"you're absolutely right I am def wrong I'll make an edit. however, we aren't sure if observer x would perceive it in an instant, cause we haven't been able to measure if our perception of time slows down as well. moving instantaneously would ofc assume that it wouldn't. since we have no proof either way, it's kinda just conjecture rn."
dataisbeautiful,fr1mdeg,t1_fr1lwyt,1589822228.0,"we assume so yes. but while we've measured time dilation with instruments, we have not been able to tell if our perception remains at the same rate. it is entirely possible that our perception will slow down with it, so we experience 5 years too. I screwed up the original comment tho, so my bad."
dataisbeautiful,fr1l41a,t1_fr1kd10,1589821607.0,"for people around you maybe but your perception/experience of time remains 1:1 if I remember my physics courses correctly

edit: the people around you would see you take the required amount of time. you might think it's instantaneous (that would mean our perception of time does not scale with speed) or you would experience the same time as those outside would see (meaning how we experience time scales on a 1:1 scale with how fast we're traveling). there's no really proof for either yet as we haven't been able to get any measurements with human perception of time dilation yet."

I'm not a physicist, but I can tell you're a significant figure

how come I know the first 52 digits of pi but I don't know your number?

are we inverse logical functions? cause I could compliment you all day

I wish that I was your Fourier Transformation so I could investigate the frequency of your curves

are you a constant? cause I want you at the base of my natural log

excuse me, can I get your seven significant digits?
