They're just very different. the '84 movie is the result of a studio hiring a director with a unique style to bring what they hoped would be a new Star Wars style grand space opera to the big screen. Then, said studio interfered because Lynch was doing what they hired him to do, just not in the way they wanted him to do it.

movies,fokfkjb,t1_fokcshu,1587841146.0,"I've gotta attempt this. Apologies while I both waffle on & try to simplify....

It's set in the far future, they give the year as 10,191 but their calendar begins thousands of years after our time. the universe is ruled by a single ""emperor"", with subordinate royal houses ruling their own planets.

The world of the books has minimal technology due to a war against ""thinking machines"" which took place in their remote past. Due to this war people have worked on improving & evolving their own capabilities, leading to societies such as the all female Bene Gesserit who have the abilty to alter their internal biochemistry (to counter poison as an example), also the Spacing Guild which controls all space travel due to them having ""Navigators"" who can see pathways through space. The Spacing Guild has the technology to ""fold space"" (basically some kind of instantaneous worm-hole travel system) but they need Navigators to ""see"" the path.

All (or most) of society is dependant on a substance known as Melange, which is unique and found on only one planet in all the universe; Arrakis, commonly known as Dune due to it being basically one big desert. Without Melange the guild cannot navigate space, the Bene Gesserit cannot do a lot of the stuff they do. It's the most valuable substance in the universe.

The story centers around the Atriedes family (kind of the heroes) who are given governorship of the planet Arrakis by the emperor.
The Atriedes are ruled by their duke, Leto. His son, Paul is unknowingly part of a breeding plan by the Bene Gesserit to produce a kind of superhuman (big simplification there).

The Bene Gesserit are a major player behind the scenes in all universal concerns. They have serious long term plans, in addition to their breeding program they seed religions on various planet, manipulate politics, etc. They are very interested in Paul because of his place in their breeding program (to say more about this would give away some important plot points). One of the planets where the Bene Gesserit have seeded & manipulated religion is Arrakis/Dune. The native nomadic desert people of Dune (The Fremen) have a prophecy regarding a chosen one/messiah type figure who will lead them to ""freedom"". Paul Atriedes fits the requirements of their chosen one in various ways.

Edit : Major Thankyou's to whoever gave me gold!"
AskReddit,fojx9qn,t3_g7uyec,1587831252.0,"I have to admit, at the beginning of all this I was one of those people saying:

""Flu kills thousands every year. The media tried to scare the sh*t out of everyone with bird flu, swine flu, etc.""

I have obeyed the lockdown rules (and still am) so at least I don't need to beat myself up over that, but I do feel like an ass for my previously blase attitude toward it all."
AskReddit,fojw7mf,t1_fojv5vt,1587830655.0,"Thanks, really.

It's not been easy, just grateful for messenger etc during all this."
offmychest,fojuna6,t1_fojtmnr,1587829740.0,"What kind of disappointments have you experienced?

I really have been where you are right now, and I don't wanna give you more bad news but for some people the struggle is never completely over. It isn't 100% sorted for me but as time goes on I get better at handling the bad times & remembering that it's just a bad time & it won't last forever. Sometimes the best you can hope for is to develop better coping mechanisms.

The answer can be different for each person & is dependant on so many different factors: age, lifestyle, home situation, etc."

I'm just gonna assume it says something appropriately awesome."

offmychest,fojtgor,t3_g7vcm2,1587829037.0,"Life is ups & downs.

When you're feeling down try to remind yourself that it won't last forever. As long as you're here, breathing & feeling, there are possibilities & events in your future that you can't imagine right now.

Take it from someone who has been there.

Best of luck to you."
