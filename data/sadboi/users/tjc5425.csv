Body dysmorphia involves someone's mind making them see themselves as something they're not. Skinny people with it will see themselves as fat and fat people could see themselves as skinny. Mix that with either anorexia or overeating and it leads to severe health complications. People tend to develop eating disorders due to trauma in the past or severe depression that they can be dealing with. It's possible that your wife may suffer from some form of mental illness and she's using food as and eating to make her feel better. For people with eating disorders, they can't control their traumas nor their mind set with mental illnesses, but they can control what they eat and how much they eat.

One thing that has helped me with making sure I dont lash out onto others was by reading philosophy, and in particular,  Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is highly recommended. You dont need to abide by his Stoic philosophy but there is alot to take away. The one excerpt that I love is:

""Will then this which has happened prevent you from being just, magnanimous, temperate, prudent, secure against inconsiderate opinions and falsehood; will it prevent you from having modesty, freedom and everything else, by the presence of which man's nature obtains all that is its own?""
-Marcus Aurelius - Meditations

And basically it says that you shouldn't let terrible experiences or unfortunate circumstances control how you act yourself as it's only you that controls your acts and not nature nor others. You have the final say, so in the end, when you've been dealt a shit hand, like in my case, I was run over by a dump truck, should I just wallow in my own self pity and lash out at those who don't understand or should I move past this and continue to treat everyone with respect and act to my highest standards.

The words above by Marcus really resonated with me, and I hope if you do have trouble with acting in such a way maybe it could help. Sorry for the long post."

When the Valar and the elven tribes who called the Undying Lands home came over and fought the War of Wrath that sundered the lands of Middle Earth.

Unfortunately due to the Eugenics movement in the late 19th century and early 20th century in the United States, any sense of controlling the reproductive rate of poorer Americans/People of the World will come off as a very unethical and evil act.

 Should we force them to have less kids? No, that is where it definitely crosses the lines. The eugenics movement in the United States was a clear example of richer more influential Americans abiding by a social darwinism that led to the Nazis, and we should never abide by such inhumane and evil ideologies.

Should we try to educate poorer population on the negatives of having multiple kids with certain incomes? Yes. For some reason people think they'll get more help from the government, which they'll get some, but you're still going to remain poor and worse off even with that assistance.

 The only thing we can do is educate the population of the world and hope they make the intelligent choice themselves. The government should never have that amount of control over a person's choice.

atheism,f6zofv2,t1_f6zl1rm,1573319263.0,"I think the hard part about using the 10 commandments as a set of morals that everyone can abide by, is that, historically speaking, the Hebrew and Christian's that followed it, used it only towards people like them, and it's that tribalism that leads people to ignore these on a broader scale.

I agree that it would be great for them to use towards everybody, but (as an American) when I see Christian's in my country trying to keep Syrain refugees out and wanting our border patrol to shoot illegal immigrants looking to become part our country, I see how people can easily ignore aspects of the moral code they claim to abide by. 

(I just want to make it clear that I don't think that this is the majority of Christians but even a small percentage of them in my country is 10's of millions of people that have varying degrees of influence)

But I also get the point you say about killing, as war is an unfortunate reality and ""necessity"" within western culture, and I don't think a soldier is morally evil for killing in a war. So I concede to the fact that yes, murder is a better term to use, thanks."
atheism,f6ziukg,t1_f6yftc2,1573317269.0,"Yeah and that's the hard thing about it. Since morals are so subjective, it's hard convincing others to follow what you deem to be the ""right"" way. I kind of use a moralistic code of self-preservation. For instance, I think killing is wrong, because I don't want to be killed, I think stealing is wrong, because I don't want others to steal from me, and I don't want to be an asshole to others, because I don't want everyone to be assholes to me.

In a sense, I must admit that part of the scripture still influences my moral code, and that is from Luke 6:31 ""Do to others as you would have them do to you"" 

I think we also have to realize that societal morals have evolved over time too, which is why I find it hard to abide by any of the Bible myself. But yeah, it's not easy getting people to go to a moral system without religion, as there is defined set of codes like religion provides, nor some omniscient being that watches and judges everything you do.

I know that there are some atheist groups that do exist like that, but in my area, which is heavily catholic, there is nothing, so I feel like that lack of feeling like you belong in a community that cares about each other may be another cause.

facepalm,f2nqxgv,t1_f2nkfjc,1570318877.0,"I've realized that a lot of Southern states tend to run on this contractor market for employees and its massively unfair to them. They, by law, have to get worker's comp insurance, general liability insurance and so many others depending on the state so that the main employer can ""limit"" costs. They parade a slightly higher pay to these ""contractors"" as a reason why this is a good system while ignoring the costs that these employees shouldn't have to pay that the employers should be covering. Let alone they don't even have health insurance included in most cases."

I lean left, like fairly left, but I hold lots of beliefs where I do sound like what others would call ""right"" leaning, but I think it's more than just left or right, I also abide by the up/down spectrum as well, in regards to authoritarian/anarchic views. I despise authoritarian politicians more than I despise left/right views."

People should be made aware of which politicians don't support changes towards global warming and those that do. It's going to affect our world and future."
unpopularopinion,f1dl9hb,t3_d8v930,1569388295.0,"Best way to curb illegal immigration, make it easier to immigration and lessen restrictions on how many people can become a citizen. We never had a problem with it when the Irish were coming or the Italians or the Germans or the Polish (I mean the ability for them to come over and become citizens), but let's face it, we had nativist in every generation. They hated the Irish, the Italians, the Germans and the Polish. Immigrants, whether illegal or legal have always faced discrimination and sadly they might always face it, cause people suck and are assholes."
unpopularopinion,ezvl9tj,t3_d2eyjb,1568183018.0,"True, but that doesn't mean they are free from the return opinion of people disagreeing/hating them for what they believe. I absolutely agree that the government shouldn't prosecute people for hate speech as it's a slippery slope as to who determines what is defined as such. However the court of public opinion isnt confined nor hindered by those slippery slopes. If private companies and the general public want to ruin the lives of the hate filled people because of what they say, then that's society and not the government deciding to no longer accept that. 

All in all, I agree with you that the government shouldn't punish/prosecute people for hateful things they say, but they also don't have a duty to protect people from the public's reaction to what they say. The 1st amendment only protects your freedom of speech from being infringed upon by the government."

Intent is hard to prove with out any written/audio records showing thus. So I see where they were coming for with this ruling, and I may not agree with it, but I do understand the reasoning."
unpopularopinion,exjunab,t1_exikdkl,1566361027.0,"This is my tactic as well, and I'm a pretty liberal, whenever I talk to people I know I disagree with, I usually just start out by explaining my side, not trying to persuade the person I'm talking to. I see it as me putting my information out there, not to say I'm right, or your wrong, but to simply provide an explanation of my beliefs and where they come from.

In the end, after the conversation ends, we tend to still disagree, but I feel like that I've put that information out there and it leaves the choice to them. They can use that information, think on it and learn more and change their views. They can think about and realize where I come from and realize others like me may have reached their beliefs in the same way and become more understanding of  the ""other side."" Or they can discard it completely and just say, ""You're the only liberal I like."" Which I will say, unfortunately is usually the case.

No skin off my back though, I did what I can and I said my peace. What I say may have influence on people, and it does, but it may not, and that is true too, it doesn't. The most I can influence for sure is what I do and what I say, and so I'd rather conduct myself in manner to others as I'd have them to me, even if I may not be given the same liberty.

Edit: Fixed some grammar and spelling."
