depression,fr28ng6,t3_gm1bew,1589833042.0,"People don't get caught the first time they do something. They did it in a place that was risky to be caught in, meaning they had already done it before and built up some level of confidence in their ability to ""not get caught"" in order to be doing it on the kitchen counter. Think about it, if you were cheating on your partner for the first time and you were all under the same roof, would your first choice be the kitchen counter? No, it's only something that's done after a long time of ""getting away"" with numerous encounters. It's too bold for a first time.

She wasn't lonely, they're both attracted to each other and decided to act upon it with no respect for you. You don't fuck random people out of loneliness. Put yourself in her shoes. Say you're lonely. What do you do? You call a friend. You call a family member. You message your cousin. You sit in bed with your partner. You play with a pet. You don't fuck someone randomly. This wasn't random. For fucking to occur there needs to be desire and intent. It's an intentional affair that's been going on behind your back for a while.

You need to understand, that you finding out is a big blessing, because you now know to not waste anymore time/energy/feelings. She lost YOU, you didn't lose her, she's no loss. She's literally not only a whore and a deceiver but a disrespectful audacious cow and your roommate is no better. They know what they did was wrong so in no way are you in a position inferior to them. Rather you're the one in the position to call all the shots. Organise yourself a new place to live and begin a new chapter without either of them in it. Do not give second chances. Block, delete and move on. There's nothing that hurts a cheater more than when the innocent party moves on in a completely cold-turkey manner with no ability to manipulated.

Until you're able to find a new place, please stay with a family member or friend. Surround yourself with those that love and respect you. Don't feel like you have no options. You have options. I don't know what country you're in but I'm fairly sure it's legal in this COVID-19 crisis to relocate to the home of a relative or friend if your current accommodation becomes damaging to your health/safety."

Our LOs most of the time have some degree of awareness that someone likes them in excess, as limerence makes you give off desperate vibes no matter what you say/do.

The key to removing limerence is to look at what that person adds to your life/wellbeing that you don't have otherwise. Then you need to find a way to make that component a part of your life/wellbeing without that person. Limerence is largely about someone filling a void.

AskReddit,fpv971v,t3_gffps6,1588938985.0,"I got accused of pushing someone in front of a moving vehicle, just because I happened to be one of several witnesses who were unfortunate enough to watch a car not paying attention and hitting a pedestrian. The persons who made the accusation was the family of the deceased, who weren't even present at the scene. They simply didn't like me because I was of a different religion and race to them, and it was only plausible for someone so different to them, to be guilty. Thankfully this accusation was cleared from my name very quickly as police knew it wasn't actually possible, due to the evidence at hand, the fact that it was witnessed by others, and on top of that the driver himself admitted to what he had done.

I've also been accused by a mentally ill ex-friend of mine of doing ""black magic"" to her and wanting to kill her, as she got a ""sad vibe"" from me when she was staying over at my place one time. Sad vibe yes because I was battling severe depression and anxiety at the time, and thought she as my friend was understanding of this. But no, she liked the idea of drama and speculation, and proceeded to tarnish my name among our friendship group with her wacky ideas. The damage done has never been recovered, and I lost all those friends in one hit. That was back in 2016.

Oh and one last one. Another girl I used to be friends with had a bit of a rough patch in her life and did some immature actions such as pranking boys on her phone in my presence. I tried to help her out of this rough patch by means of always being there for her when she was lonely, cleaning her house when she was unable to do so, giving her advice, getting her involved in a charity organisation that would benefit her, etc. When I informed her that I didn't want to be friends with her anymore after discovering that she was talking ill of me behind my back despite all I've done for her, she proceeded to accuse me of forcing her to prank these boys and being the one to blame for all the mistakes she made during her rough patch, when I never asked her to do any of it... and she also had the nerve to claim that I had never done anything for her.

Ohhhh and another one. I was once accused of having sex with someone I barely knew, just because we had a nap in the same room together after a long day out fishing. Apparently it's impossible to be friends with someone of the opposite gender and falling asleep accidentally means we fucked!

Accused of being a potential slut because I said ""lol"" out of sheer awkwardness, to a dick pic that was sent. ""Lol"" means I'm laughing at you, not that I'm enjoying it.

Back in highschool, accused of ""running around in the middle of the night"" whilst I was on a school camp, just because I walked out of my allocated room crying after having one of my bullies sexually assault me.

I could go onnnnnn."

Also, you're not alone in this world... you're just in the wrong place, surrounded by the wrong people. Sometimes all it takes is to find even one person that you vibe with, for life to seem bearable. Until you find that person (or people), keep building you, and blossoming into the best version of your beautiful self that you can be. Enjoy your surroundings in the now and try your best to feel immense gratitude for all that you have. Sounds silly but sometimes when my depression is heavier than usual I try to see my surroundings the same way that Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz sees her surroundings when she realises she's not in Kansas anymore, full of awe and appreciation even if you have to force it at first.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N77NaxlGlU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N77NaxlGlU) And you will realise just how blessed you are to have reasonable health, safety, shelter, food, clean water, electricity, nature outside, clothing, technology, and so on and so forth.
