Anxiety,foi6lmf,t3_g6u4dj,1587779789.0,"I had been totally fine the first month in quarantine. I’ve been working from home and I’ve been enjoying this time to myself up to last week when I randomly got a very weird and sharp anxiety out of nowhere to the point where it didn’t go away for 7 days. Something I had never experienced in my life. I’m currently recovering from that horrible episode and still don’t feel 100% recovered. I was going crazy the first 2-3 nights because I had never had anxiety for more than an hour, 2 the longest. The first night was horrible. I didn’t know what to do or what to take and I felt like I was gonna die. I was laying down for 6 hours trying to fall asleep and just couldn’t. I was so scared for my life because I had never had this before. The 2nd and 3rd night got so bad to the point where I took some of my moms prescription (clonazepam 10 mg) to help me. I know, it was a very stupid move on my end, BUT that thing saved my life twice. I have reached out to the doctors and spoke to a therapist the other day and have an appointment with a psychiatrist in a couple weeks. Thankfully I’ve been okay, but still not fully over my anxiety which is my current goal. Every day I have been getting to know my body and my anxiety a bit more. I started taking vitamins and CBD oil for emergencies only. CBD oil is AMAZING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
