I hope people would think the same about being vulnerable. I always get the short end of the stick and people tell me to move on with life because it won't get any better. I think they're right about that for the most part ðŸ˜¢ gotta really fake it till you make it."
SuicideWatch,f6m4teu,t1_f6m3k7c,1572966627.0,"I don't really have the funds to go somewhere else or do anything really crazy but I've been indulging myself with mundane stuff that I don't get to enjoy anymore, I think this would suffice as some of my last memories."
depression,f6m1yyg,t3_drz9rw,1572965349.0,I fake my strength and dedication to my work. In reality I don't have any motivation and I'm a prick who's vulnerable with the emotional stability of an infant.
SuicideWatch,f6lzcv9,t3_drs6rp,1572964107.0,"Feeling the same way as you right now... I wish there was some way to disappear completely. 

However I do hope there is a way for you to seek help. I hope you have a solid support system and that the next hours will feel less scary even for a bit âœ¨"
depression,f6lxo0r,t3_drv641,1572963307.0,"Samedt. I'm in art school and I've maxed all my absences and I am so behind every class right now. I got a lot in my plate aside from uni problems but this is just the icing on the cake. I just cannot function anymore and I am planning on my untimely demise. 

I hope you get better and finally catch up tho âœ¨ðŸŒŸ"
ptsd,f6lma00,t3_drrg5t,1572952737.0,"I am in the same boat as u rn. My attendance is fucked because depression and trauma decided to creep on me in the middle of the semester and I am so screwed. I took a leave 2 terms ago because I felt so much exhaustion and it was probably then that I realised I might be traumatized over an event I deemed trivial. 

I hope you can talk your way out to your professors and your counselors. Idk how your uni goes but I wish they have good facilities for students dealing with mental health issues."
ptsd,f6lk3ae,t3_drix9x,1572949502.0,I'm a clown ðŸ¤¡ and whenever I word vomit the trauma I experience people laugh it out and think I have dark humor. Oh well noose noose.
SuicideWatch,f6li0p6,t3_dkrmv8,1572946107.0,Hope you're feeling better right now. I'm in the same position recently but it's been a month and my brain has locked the idea of killing myself since I haven't gotten any better.
