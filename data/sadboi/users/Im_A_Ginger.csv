mentalhealth,flbanc4,t1_flajwtt,1585000767.0,"Thanks for responding, I'm so glad my message could help!  I can relate to both sides of your post pretty well.  I used to think the way those people who responded to you in the other sub do, except instead of taking it out on other people, I focused the negative energy inward.  It wasn't helped either by the constant feeling of loneliness I experienced that I still struggle with today.

Something that I'm sure you have noticed, is that with loneliness, it's something we sometimes feel embarrassed by.  It can seem like the reason we're lonely is that there must be something wrong with us, which leads us to be hyperaware of any of our flaws, creating a loop of negative self-image that is hard to break out of.

You're reaching out both here and another sub, along with seeing a therapist which is incredible.  You've already taken steps towards bettering yourself that many people, myself included struggle to get to. 

If you ever need someone to listen, I'm always around.  Good luck with everything and keep on the path to happiness that you've already started down."
mentalhealth,fla6ggi,t3_fnk22w,1584977651.0,"Actually interesting timing on your post as I was just hearing a doctor on the radio talking about how common loneliness is in our world.  A big thing he talked about was that while we have many social connections made, it really doesn't matter how many you make.  What matters is the quality of those connections.  You can be in a room of 100 people and still feel alone due to the poor quality of these connections.

A big part of quality of connections with others are feeling you can be yourself/not feeling the need to pretend to be something you aren't, feeling that you can rely on someone, not feeling alone in your problems, etc.  Your post describes a lot of this well which explains the feelings of loneliness you're experiencing that so many of us in today's world experience.

I'm sorry you had to experience that from others, but I guess now we know a place to avoid.  I would also add that anything you can do in service of others such as volunteering or even checking on someone who might need it and help with these feelings."
