Advice,fqzwedu,t1_fqzvtmx,1589777057.0,Yep! Just send him a text or email with the proper dates and time frame included and keep screenshots of it. I am a Canadian but I believe this should be the same in the states as well. Just in case he tries to take you or your mother to court saying you didn‚Äôt give him proper notice.

ACTrade,fqmovq6,t3_gjoewx,1589481042.0,"I don‚Äôt watch a ton of anime now but I did watch soul eater and sword art online a few years ago and enjoyed them both :) I‚Äôd say my favourite from soul eater was death the kid! I just found him to be funny and unique to the other characters. My favourite from sword art online was probably Asuna, I like Kirito lots too but Asuna is just so pretty üíï

I know it‚Äôs only two animes but hopefully that suffices!!! I‚Äôm remodeling my town right now and really hoping for bells or a lucky cat üê± 

Some of my other favourite shows include, Brooklyn 99 and how I met your mother! Both just relaxing shows for me to watch  and my kind of humour :) my favourite character from Brooklyn 99 is Captain holt, he‚Äôs just funny to me at first but throughout the seasons he really develops a lot from just ‚Äústone cold holt‚Äù to a funny goof ball like the rest of them. Every time I see him interacting with Jake I just crack up lol. 

... I have no idea how I changed the font but I guess this is cool.

Edit: fixed the font and realized I forgot my most hated characters! From soul eater is Eruka the frog girl, I just find her extremely annoying. The way she talks and acts... and for sao I‚Äôm not sure ü§î I guess I have to go with the game maker guy who traps them all there... what a bad dude. From. Brooklyn 99 it‚Äôs the new girl they added in the latest season, I despise her so much I don‚Äôt even know her name, nor do I care to."
