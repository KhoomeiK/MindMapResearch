bipolar,fjm78vq,t3_fe3a0k,1583463231.0,"I’m going to try provigil. It keeps the Air Force pilots alert. I’m on adderall but I’m old, so they don’t want to give me a high enough dosage to work throughout the day and evening. I find it makes me feel very normal, and I have no desire to abuse it, the long acting type works very well and is not spiky. I’d say try it. I couldn’t work a regular job without it."
BipolarReddit,fj8lwod,t3_fby6sq,1583116464.0,"I didn’t know I was pregnant and was on lithium for several months. I was hysterical after reading some of the horror stories. As in turned out the baby was perfect, no birth defects. The stories were midst that, stories. I had a really good doctor who reassured me all the way."
BipolarReddit,fhyxy39,t1_fh1vzzt,1581986341.0,The key is to only take 5 mg. It is a tormtal pick me up at that dosage. The tens didn’t work for me at all—made me pace the floor all day. But 5 is perfect.

BipolarReddit,fh1ujh2,t3_f139kg,1581224629.0,I do. And the secret for me is just 5 mg of Abilify. It works like a charm. I wake up raring to go at 4:30 in the morning! It’s amazing.

bipolar,fb4linf,t1_fb3h1lt,1576511193.0,"Skewed is the whole story. I wasn’t happy with it, so I rewrote it in the Trilogy. The trilogy is the best one to read, I think."

bipolar,fb2rgrv,t3_eb6z7o,1576456356.0,"I am an old lady (70) and I have been diagnosed as bipolar 1 with adhd and generalized anxiety. I take adderall, cymbalta, and latuda (it used to be abilify). I work full time for the us coast guard. I have had quite the experiences with bipolar, and I have written about it in three books. If you are a reader go to amazon books or Barnes and noble and you can get my first three books to read about my experiences. They are: Skewed: I’m not bipolar, I’m an astral traveler; The Trilogy of bipolar management, parts 1 and2. I haven’t finished the third part yet. Writing really helped me get over the stigma of mental illness. I’m darn near normal now on meds."
BipolarReddit,fae8ezw,t1_fadu0dq,1575995914.0,The worst drugs for memory loss are the benzodiazepines. I took Xanax for a long time and I don’t remember words as well now or things that happened a few years ago. I wouldn’t have taken it if I had known that.
BipolarReddit,f9mo6ao,t3_e5yvt2,1575466108.0,"I took exactly the same thing for 8 years. The only thing that messed me up was Sudafed. Also, I was taking Xanax, and it affected my memory and made me very sleepy. So I’m off the Xanax and I avoid most antihistamines, although Nasacort seems to work well with no side effects. The ability may raise your blood sugar, so keep an eye out for diabetes."
bipolar,f9km41a,t3_e5iqya,1575403275.0,I had exactly the same experience and then I found my dream job and got a 5 year contract. I can now retire after this job is done. I never would have believed it could happen.

BipolarReddit,f92dm57,t3_e31uj8,1575025773.0,"I know just what you mean. Strangely, unless I’m sick I do feel happy all the time on the meds I take now. I had to go off them because of some bad side effects and get new ones. In the interim I was not happy at all. It was obvious because I kind of turned on the people around me and withdrew. It scares me that I’m not myself when not on the meds. I wonder which is the real me. I like having a full range of emotions. I wrote a book about this, several, in fact. I’m back on good meds now and feel great again. My partner has told me he will leave me if I have any more episodes. So I stay on the meds and stand up for myself when I feel upset or cranky due to normal life events. We have to be allowed a range of emotions. Some meds took that away from me. Anyhow good luck with the holidays. At least you have people looking out for you, even if they are misguided."

It was quite a ride. I'm so normal now I am boring after finding good meds for me, though meds are always a problem in one way or another."
WeirdLit,f8x93pl,t1_f8fn2tl,1574911694.0,"I read an exceedingly weird thriller that I totally loved called The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelenides.I'm new to the group so don't know if this qualifies, as it's not horror or sci fi, but as a murder mystery, it's the best one I read in years. And it's about a psychiatrist and his patient who doesn't speak after being accused of killing her beloved husband. So I couldn't resist it. I think it's a good book for bipolar people to read. Let me know what you think."
bipolar,f8t71qh,t3_e22nwe,1574797189.0,I don’t notice any side effects at all—I just feel better. My insurance doesn’t cover it all though so I won’t be able to stay on it. They want $550 a month even with the insurance. That is ridiculous! I’ll go back on ability.
