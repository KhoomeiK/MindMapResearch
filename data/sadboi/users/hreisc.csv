* we have 220 indigineous ethnicities, 10 being the main ones

Due to the Brazilian regime's unwillingness to get more deeply involved in the Allies' war effort during WW2, by early 1943 a popular saying was: ""It's more likely for a snake to smoke a pipe than for the FEB to go the front and fight."" (*""Mais fÃ¡cil uma cobra fumar um cachimbo, do que a FEB embarcar para o combate.""*).Before the FEB entered combat, the expression ""a cobra vai fumar"" (""the snake will smoke"") was often used in Brazil in a context similar to ""[when pigs fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigs_fly)"". As a result, the soldiers of the FEB called themselves *Cobras Fumantes* (literally, *Smoking Snakes*) and wore a divisional [shoulder patch that showed a snake smoking a pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Expeditionary_Force#/media/File:Brazilian_Expeditionary_Forces_insignia_(smoking_snake).svg)."

I say if you think later on in life (after you get tired of having to re-glue, or you don't think it's aesthetic anymore) you will not be able to afford a proper bridge then do one now if the program covers it. However, you should be aware that a real bridge will remove much more tooth structure and has it's pros and cons as well: it can be aesthetic but you must take proper care of it or else you lose the whole bridge.
