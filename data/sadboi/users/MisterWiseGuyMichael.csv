predaddit,fdiuxuk,t1_fcyx2c1,1578451608.0,I thought I was the only “dad-to-be” that was very concerned about the Middle East ....thanks for sharing this. Definitely makes me feel normal. I’m normally anxious about many things but feel like it’s been heightened since we are expecting.
predaddit,fdiupfh,t3_ejbyhm,1578451457.0,"First time dad here...

We are approaching 10 weeks on Thursday! The wife has been very nauseous so I bought everything under the sun (Ginger Chews, Preggie Pops, Sea-Bands, Raw Ginger, and Lemon). I’ve had lots of anxiety about unnecessary things like where will the baby go to school and how will we handle child care (totally irrational but I’m a worrier). Also I’m starting to get more excited because we are getting closer to figure out the gender. Fun times!!!!"
predaddit,fdf0ptx,t3_eknh1k,1578350684.0,"My advice is not to skip the process! I would head to the EDD office and have them walk you through it. 

I’m in SoCal and there’s a local office in Chino Hills that is pretty efficient. The EDD office will definitely guide you through. I have a friend that went for help with disability."
predaddit,fdezalt,t3_ekzd59,1578349794.0,Okay so I’m not alone! My wife is 9 weeks and I’m  having trouble sleeping and wondering about expenses that don’t exist yet! I feel like I’m a wreck in progress.
