It’s unrealistic to expect that two people in a long term relationship are always going to be able to control their impulses all time. Especially if the sex life is dwindling.

mentalhealth,f6pup8j,t3_dsgo46,1573064676.0,"Are you over the age of 18?  Are you located in the United States?  If both of these are true, then your health information is protected by HIPPA, any information as to why you are seeking help is protected by law from your parents.  It sounds like your mom is pretty nosy, but insurance companies cannot give her your health information, though I am not sure if she would get a bill indicating that you sought some kind of service.  If she pokes and prods , you might want to tell her something along the lines of being stressed about school and struggling to sleep.

As for the the experience you are describing, are your good weeks associated with less need for sleep, lots of exciting fast-arriving thoughts, and/or increased activity levels?  I'm asking, because this could indicate that you are having hypomanic or manic episodes, which are associated with bipolar disorder.  And, it would a be rapid cycling bipolar disorder.  (Coming from a licensed counselor who specializes in trauma and bipolar disorder).  That being said, obviously you need to meet with an professional to get a full assessment and proper diagnosis.  And, unfortunately, left untreated, bipolar disorder (if that is even the condition you are dealing with) can get worse with time.

As for treatment, I typically help people construct a more structured schedule that incorporates a consistent sleep schedule (a super important part of treating bipolar disorder, the lack of sleep can lead to delusions/psychosis and too much sleep makes depression worse).  Hypomanic episodes, which it sounds like you might have, are not as concerning, unless you go several days without getting much sleep, which can lead to a manic episode.  Manic episodes are much harder to treat and usually require medications. As for depressive episodes, I help people identify how their thinking is contributing to how they feel, then I help them challenge or let go of unhelpful thinking styles.  To challenge unhelpful thinking styles, you need to look at evidence that does not support an unhelpful thought.  For example, if you have the thought ""I'm worthless,"" you notice that thought and ask yourself, ""wait, what is some evidence that does not support that thought... Well, I have friends that love me, I'm a good artist, I am kind and caring, and etcetera.  And you need to repeat these affirmations to yourself over and over again when you are down.  If you struggle to find evidence to counter unhelpful thoughts, then you ask people who love you, or you talk to your therapist.

So, this comment is a very simple breakdown, and I wish I had more time to talk to you today.  I really think you should just try the school counselor to see what they are like.  Maybe they will have some practical tips you can use.  I wish you the best as you move forward!

The reason why I suggest this is because it sounds a lot like you have an anxious attachment style and he has an avoidant attachment style.  If you google these attachment styles, you may be able to find some tips on how to navigate the anxious-avoidant relationship duo.  The book I suggested also offers some helpful advice.

Essentially, if you want to stay in this relationship with him, you have to give up the need for the intimacy you desire.  You've already expressed your needs, and he is unwilling or unable to fulfill them. So... put more energy into other relationships (or into forming new ones).  Put more energy into your own hobbies and interests.  Keep yourself busy, don't look at your phone too much waiting for him. 

It also sounds like you have some of your own work to do on building your self-esteem.  This takes years of work.  Practicing positive affirmations.

You do not appear to trust in your in-law's parenting skills (with some good reason).  And this apparently puts them on the defense.  I think, overall, it will be important to try to repair the relationship, but not be as close to them as you were before. Research shows that there are reasons it is healthy for children to have grandparents in their lives.  ( [https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2018/09/06/close-relationship-with-grandparents-benefits-grandchildren/](https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2018/09/06/close-relationship-with-grandparents-benefits-grandchildren/) )  However, for your own sanity and your in-laws, maybe you need to limit how much time your daughter spends with them.

I would also advise you to refrain from giving parenting advice.  I know that you are trying to protect your daughter, but parenting advice tends to put parents on the defense.  Kids are more resilient than we think, so maybe you need to trust that your daughter will be okay after some time with the in-laws and their different rules and ways of disciplining.  That being said, I want to say that I think you did the right thing by trying to clear up what your daughter said about the snake in the bed with the in-laws.  Unfortunately, sexual abuse is often swept under the rug.  The fact that you listen to your daughter and take things she says seriously means so much.  If she ever was, heaven forbid, sexually abused, your response of empathy, support, and \*believing\* her is going to be the difference between whether she heals from it during childhood or develops PTSD.

I want to reiterate that I don’t expect the whole check, just wish he would be more generous with it at least. If it were me getting the check in a card addressed to both of us, you better believe I would be sharing that with him."

I need to remember it’s an assumption, and not necessarily fact that his parents meant the gift for me. This helps actually, thanks. And thanks for putting it out there respectfully."
relationship_advice,f1fkyzl,t1_f1f9al7,1569446749.0,"I don’t think I’ve necessarily been deprived, besides the fact that sometimes (not all the time,) he is unwilling to help me or my friends with things, even if he is able. It’s like he thinks women are out to take advantage of him. Despite my generosity with time, money, and emotional support, he is inconsistent with how willing he is to share his own time and money. It often does not feel like a partnership, it’s like a tit for tat thing, sometimes even a competition. We have some major stuff to work though.

Thanks so much for your input."
relationship_advice,f1fjt24,t1_f1fcg7o,1569446003.0,"You are acting like I’m trying to take half his paycheck. This is was a gift that probably was meant for both of us. That he is pocketing, has been pocketing secretly for years, even though the gift was addressed to both of us. 

The only lack of self-awareness I have is accepting selfish behavior from someone who is supposed to be my partner. 

And, yes, I am a therapist. And, no, none of us are perfect. I have a tendency to tolerate some pretty shitty behavior (so close friends and my own therapist say), and struggle with having boundaries with people. It took a lot of courage for me to seek strangers advice, especially when I’m supposed to have it together. Please be kind and give constructive advice instead of trying to rip me down."

There is a reluctance to spend money on me and to help me with things (I.e. hang a shelf on the wall, take our pet to the vet). He was in a bad relationship in which he was used, so I think he feels like the need to protect himself and have boundaries. It’s weird because I really am generous to him. I buy him gifts if I see something he would like, bring him food, and have taken him out and on trips when I get a bonus or made a lot at work that month."

Ask anyone who knows me, I’m generous. I think maybe I just have too high of expectations for my partner and need to let them go.

Despite how disrespectful some of this feedback is, I’m taking it into consideration and trying to learn to look past the evidence and let it go. 

You all don’t know me, but I am actually a very nice person and probably too generous for my own good. Maybe my expectations for others are too high, so I need to accept that he’s not as generous as me or do something about it."

Another suggestion, have you pulled up some medical research to show your parents?  Research shows that the longer psychosis goes untreated, the poorer the prognosis.  It's extremely important for your future well-being that you start getting this treated right away.  Good luck, I hope you figure something out.

I suggest moving on. I know that that may seem daunting, but you will have a fresh perspective and discomfort always leads to strength and growth. Make sure you tell your new therapist what happened and how it made you feel. Well wishes to you, sorry it took so long to reply."

Psychonaut,erp4moi,t3_c373na,1561099498.0,"I feel ya, I wish I could hold onto those feelings too.  However, feelings change like the weather.  I don't think we can really control feelings, especially can't force feelings.  The good news is that psychedelics do increase the plasticity of our brains, so that open-mindedness and feeling of oneness are still in there.  You may now be more open to spiritual experiences, because you feel more connected with the universe and nature.  Personally, I found that psychedelics have helped me explore my spirituality more and have turned me onto Pantheism.  Nature is my church, and every time I am in it, I'm reminded of past trips and the connectedness they showed me.  I see each past trip as a lesson."

Love the idea of the introductory tape. I’ll admit though, I usually tell the client about my approach during our first meeting, and let them decide whether they think I would be a good fit. Sounds like you think it would be better for the clinician to decide about the fit? This is good to know, I want to make sure clients feel comfortable, like I look forward to working with them."
