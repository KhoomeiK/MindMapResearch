you can also find stories/comments all over reddit and instagram of people who’ve lost a loved one from something completely unrelated, without having ANY covid symptoms and they get marked as a Covid death. 

i understand that it’s probably safer to overestimate Covid deaths than underestimate them but on the the other hand, causing a panic that might not be necessary has its own repercussions. there’s not much information posted yet as we’re currently going through the months, but suicide rates have absolutely skyrocketed. in my own town, they’re up 400%."

I own U-No-LX from TAL and the Mini V3 from arcadia. They both cost about $60 I think and are incredible softsynth plugins that emulate the Juno and Mini Korg. 

In terms of drums, you can find some drum samples out there that hit the spot, or Logic’s Analog Circuits drum’s did me well too. 

Once you have the synths, it’s mostly about the style of composition now. The single-note arpeggiated chugging bass line and high-tempoed drums is what brings it together

I’m no professional but I’ve spent the past year or so working on 80s music and am now making sort of a blend of indie and 80s, with dreamy guitars and synthesizers. 

Feel free to PM me with any questions, would love to help!

TooAfraidToAsk,fnkygky,t3_g28vgz,1587043102.0,"I’m not really sure where I stand on the spectrum. 

I believe the Government approves all types of things because our illness is money in their pockets and now almost an essential part of business/economy. 

I’ve never gotten a Flu shot and I’ve had the Flu once in my life. My parents don’t get it either because it just seems unnecessary. I do have my other vaccines as they were required for school. 

Now with Corona, I’m a bit of skeptic. I don’t know exactly what I believe with all of this news and whatnot, but I’m personally just entirely skeptical of the origins of this virus. It seems too convenient, too planned/rigged, too perfect to just be an accident. 

With that being said, if Coronavirus becomes seriously worse I’ll probably get the vaccine for peace of mind (i’m a hypochondriac) but I’ll never approve of being injected with mysterious shit approved by the government. If they’re going to put what’s basically Motor Oil (BHT, TBHQ) in all the common junk food snacks, which is proven to cause cancer, why would they actually try to help me by giving me a vaccine?

I just think the whole system is rigged. I often think much larger than my own life which is why I passionately feel skeptical on matters like this, but zooming in to my own life, getting the vaccine is probably just the best thing to do but we’ll see."

Flipping,fmwcdwd,t1_fmwbhyq,1586443978.0,this seems like the clear answer. i’m uneasy about going through on one of the offers. plus they have no profile pic and no reviews
Flipping,fmwazt4,t1_fmwawjx,1586443197.0,Yeah that’s the exact price i listed it for. do you know what their intentions of scamming are? free item?
Flipping,fmw49fe,t1_fmw3w3p,1586439185.0,"thanks so much, that’s exactly what i thought but just wanted to double check!"
IsItBullshit,fmipv7r,t1_fmiflz0,1586114485.0,"May I ask why you think they would *want* to prove how horrible this radiation/waves is?

So many companies, people, and the 1% would be out of *lots* of money

The whole system is literally a game. They don’t care about us or what the radiation does. Our sickness is money in their pockets!

My father went for one (1) chemotherapy surgery/treatment and our bill was over $600,000. Why would big companies who benefit from those bills NOT want to increase their ‘customers’

I’m not saying my opinions are right and that yours/others are wrong, but I think everyone can benefit from a bit of skepticism. Blindly believing what large companies and governments say is mindless obedience."

I do think there is an ego boost I receive from having the upper hand and ending things with them."
IsItBullshit,fmiijlr,t1_fmigmak,1586110269.0,Me too. Completely agreed. But to entirely invalidate a high school experiment as if they’re idiots? That’s the flaw
IsItBullshit,fmifd8c,t1_fmietej,1586108464.0,"I don’t know why people think that the only true information can come from “actual scientists”. 

Obviously they’re young but it doesn’t invalidate the results of their experiment. It’s not like the whole thing was some freak accident because they’re in elementary school. 
Lmao"
