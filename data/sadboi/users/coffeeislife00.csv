I‚Äôm always cold (even during the day) so I get under the covers and snuggle up so maybe I just get overheated at some point from the blanket.
puppy101,ff7yck4,t1_ff52rdh,1579661280.0,Thank you so much for your input. Your feedback ran through my head all day at work today and I was determined when I got home that I would do things differently. I kept treats with me at all times and rewarded him every time he did something right or listened. I hadn‚Äôt realized it but I was half assing it. I‚Äôve never had a dog before so all of this is new to me.  I also made sure things he shouldn‚Äôt have were out of his reach and that he wasn‚Äôt left unsupervised. I also made sure to give him extra play time outside. I feel more encouraged today. Cautious but encouraged. So thank you again.

I just figured the foster family he was with was so good that he learned right from wrong well enough from them before coming to us. But I guess he still has to learn our routine, our hard no‚Äôs, our rules. 

I‚Äôm definitely going to try the things you mentioned above. And I think like a previous commenter said I should keep treats handy and constantly reward him when he responds the right way to something. I‚Äôve only been doing that when we‚Äôve been practicing our training tricks. The other times I praise him verbally but I need to start out giving him treats for those things too for a while."
