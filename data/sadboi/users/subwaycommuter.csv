And I am white. So what I did was basically walk to the police station nearby with him following me and trying to get me to tell him my name and other stuff (I told him I lived there and all but he wanted to know my actual address and ofc I didn't give it to him) and then when we arrived at the station the dude entered but left before the officers came to talk to us. I went back home after waiting for him to be far but it was awful. I would recommend calling the police in a situation like that, but I'm white and so maybe that wouldn't apply to everybody."

In a court of Justice there's no way I could prove he is doing anything illegal with enough certainty to, and I can't be certain of that here either, other than he said in another comment he is pricing bellow cost, pretty straightforwardly. 

It's true, that legal there'd still be the issue of whether or not he will end up suprapricing after killing the competition.... I have no way to know that. But he seems pretty confident it makes sense to do this now from a business perspective. He is not getting vengeance on anyone, but is doing a sound business strategy to later on gain more money, I assume, suprapricing his consumers... That is definitely TA, although I agree again that unless one can show analyzing his market that in all likelihood he will viably be able to supracharge later the case would not stand in the US.

On price-fixing: I don't mean I expect him to raise prices to let that woman's business live, much less talk to her about it. But if he is pricing bellow cost, that's illegal, and he should raise prices to above his costs.

AmItheAsshole,fetkf21,t1_fetfcbv,1579376335.0,"Predatory pricing is illegal in the US, because what it means is that one is temporary lowering his price bellow his own cost which is unsustainable and an anti-competitive activity since the goal there is to bankrupt competition. Therefore, low prices in predatory pricing stems not from higher productivity but simply higher cash availability to lower your price bellow your own cost for long enough to starve out smaller competition. What  everyone is asking is not for him to increase princes so she can survive, but for his prices to be in a healthy level above his costs. Predatory pricing law doesn't protect HER (his competition), it protects the customers by protecting ""competition"" in the general sense. 

I admit I'm assuming, though, that his costs are above his current price, but I think that's a reasonable assumption because he said he can keep them there ""for a while"". That means he couldn't keep them at the current rate ""forever"", which would be the case if he was simply pricing lower because he is more efficient than others.

Price-fixing, on the other hand, would be setting the price at a level higher than normal, which is also illegal and anti-competitive, and not at all the opposite to predatory pricing. The opposite to both is a competitive free market, actually, with predatory pricing leading usually to a monopoly while price-fixing leads to an oligopoly. 

Let's just reiterate that predatory pricing is, in fact, illegal in the US, although it's something that's very hard to prove in court, and it is acknowledged to be harmful to the consumers. The only problem is that it's hard for an outsider, like a court of Justice, to differentiate real low cost from predatory pricing... That's why the courts in the US have traditionally put high thresholds for such cases (something that has been a focus of contention more recently, nonetheless, including due to Wal-Mart for example). Fortunately, though, here it's the business owner who is telling us he is undercutting his prices and selling for a rate he can keep ""for a while"" but not forever... So the ""reasonable doubt"" that a court would have and their reason for being skeptic of applying the law, doesn't apply in our ""judgment"" here."
AmItheAsshole,fet7si6,t1_fet6k3t,1579372519.0,"He said elsewhere he is undercutting prices and can do it for a while.

If she understands being Jew as an ethnicity (a white ethnicity) no wonder she feels that's white washing. I think you should separate the religion and the ethnicity there, as your children are ""ethnically"" half Jewish and half black, but religiously fully Jewish (being raised Jewish). If you explain it to her in those terms, it might be more acceptable to her (expect I suppose the religion part ahaha).

I also think that the whole discussion about whether being born from a Jewish mother is or not sufficient to make someone a part of the Jewish community doesn't matter here, in my view, and is superfluous from her point of view. It's simply about how different Jewish groups acknowledge who belongs or not to their group, and, to her, as an outsider, it has no meaning. One could also use the one drop rule and say your children are fully black, but again, I don't think that is a discussion that'd be helpful here. I'd just stick to the ""they are being raised as members of the Jewish religion"" part, and the ""we are also sharing your family (black christian) traditions, but without the religious elements"", along with the ""our children are half black, half jewish/white"" parts."

TrueOffMyChest,fe52vfk,t1_fe51rcp,1578865170.0,Tell then your boyfriend cheated on you with someone you considered and you can't find it in yourself to forgive that.
TrueOffMyChest,fe51xwb,t1_fdxrnh1,1578864963.0,"He didn't ruin your life, he helped ruin a relationship with a boy that cheated on you."
TrueOffMyChest,fe51plx,t1_fdtguoz,1578864888.0,"I agree... But the reason she shouldn't tell isn't only because her brother doesn't deserve the consequences of that... It's also because it will come back to haunt her, emotionally, socially, and within the family."
TrueOffMyChest,fe51d86,t3_en2n0e,1578864765.0,"Break up with your boyfriend but don't out your half-brother. Not only because that's not nice, but because that will come to haunt you later on. Just keep his secret, and move on with your life,and away from your boyfriend while thinking of what future relationship you want with your brother and how you want to start it."
relationship_advice,fe50frq,t3_entr5l,1578864545.0,"I would not want my relationship with my brother to get destroyed over that, but it would make me question how much and on what I can trust him in the future. Of course."

AmItheAsshole,fdwm2be,t1_fdwcvba,1578760092.0,"English is not my first language either and I'm familiar with that subreddit . I think it's not healthy for anyone to compare that with this, or most families. There's a qualitative difference. Narcissists are not normal people, they are toxic. That's one thing. But even in normal families relationships aren't paradise and take effort, and sometimes that means walking over something you wouldn't for someone else for the family, otherwise there's no family. We have to be able to differentiate between those two situations. The difference between healthy and unhealthy can't be minimized, and an unhealthy example of a family be used to say family in itself isn't a valuable thing. Blood is partly cultural, but also partly natural - all cultures value family in one way or another. And in our society where relationships are so fleeting, family is still a rock you can trust, which means putting in effort to preserve it even when you wouldn't for someone else (in a society of fast-relationships and ghosting)."

AmItheAsshole,fdwhlbx,t1_fdrfe90,1578758781.0,That's probably what I would do.
AmItheAsshole,fdwfwqq,t1_fdquj7k,1578758241.0,"Yeah, he wasn't 5 but he was 16, and depressed. It's not an excuse but I think there'd be no disagreements that if OP brother's gf had broken up with him because of that it would be reasonable. Same thing applies now: bf might just think he doesn't want to engage emotionally in a romantic relationship with someone who can't forgive a brother after such a ""redemption arc"". It's everyone's right to behave the way they are in this case and that doesn't mean the end is going to be happy to all those who deserve happiness..."
AmItheAsshole,fdwe7lw,t1_fdq6rt0,1578757800.0,"Maybe they tried and that's how he changed. Change doesn't happen overnight and we don't know how easy or hard it was on the parents, considering that same brother who was bullying was also depressed according to what he said to OP."
AmItheAsshole,fdwclmb,t1_fdwbepd,1578757356.0,"There are many cases, but it doesn't happen without costs, emotional and all others. And while yes, he shouldn't be bound by what other people think people include himself, and that has consequences on his life which he has to be aware of when making the decision. No decision is without cost."
AmItheAsshole,fdvry3h,t1_fdvqlb8,1578750864.0,"I think it's a reason, not because it's good enough, but because it's something he'll have to deal with. All reasons I have are good enough or not only by someone's (in this case OP's) judgment, but still, even if not good enough, they are possible reasons. Being a brother alone is a reason because people, and I think even OP, will expect them to have a special relationship and they will never not be brothers, they can be brothers with a bad relationship, but that's not the same."
FriendshipAdvice,fdtw4ax,t3_emupg2,1578723170.0,"Fast doesn't equal short, but now you guys have to focus on widening this friendship that is already deep so it's structurally sound, so to say."
AmItheAsshole,fdt3cmb,t1_fdsdixf,1578711381.0,"It could but given they were in good terms for 14 years before, they seem both to be in good terms with their parents, we live in a world where friends sometimes aren't there for us, and where blood is still taken as an important factor, I think that it usually means something."
AmItheAsshole,fdqnbq7,t1_fdqmz5u,1578670714.0,"I'm thinking about a time when the situation is not yet hard and troubled because the parents are telling off OP. Away from brother so the parents could devise an intervention plan, that kind of thing."
