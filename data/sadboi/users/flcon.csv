Really glad I'm not the only one"

AmItheAsshole,f1m3k7b,t3_d9x6i7,1569582947.0,"Late reply here, but as someone who's sister almost died from an eating disorder - thats shocking behaviour from your dad. I am so so sorry that you had to deal with that

You're 100000000% NTA"

cats,exvd16k,t1_exvcoge,1566597185.0,"My mum has tried to talk to her + she's doing this with two other cats that have other owners

I appreciate what you're saying tho. She has two cats of her own so may just love cats. It's just difficult, and it's hard to hear over the phone that she won't listen to my mum trying to gently say that he's our cat and doesn't need to be fed

It's difficult on both sides, you must understand. He disappears for days and we know now that he does it because he is being fed, which means he doesn't need to come back home to us. I don't understand why someone would feed a cat that obviously has an owner"
cats,exvc8pt,t1_exvbthe,1566596735.0,"I know what you mean. We are shortening his life by letting him outside, but that's my family's decision and although I have tried to say to them that it's better to keep cats inside, they won't listen. 

I just try to let my cat know he's loved and give him the best quality of life when I'm home"
Anxiety,ex3aepf,t3_cr9ht9,1565982509.0,Yep I use this to calm myself down enough so that I can think a bit more rationally. Cold water face plunge or just putting ice on my face seems to work
Anxiety,ex39udo,t3_cr9490,1565982259.0,Had this happen recently - housemate kept messaging they wanted to talk or got my partner to tell me that housemate wanted to talk. And the housemate wouldn't talk to me?????????????
BPD,ewl735x,t3_cotp1e,1565509016.0,"Yeah I question my motivation a lot, and I also sometimes get thoughts about how I don't 'deserve' to like these things. My interests will change periodically - so I'll be heavily into cross stitch, then into reading, and eventually I'll probably pick up cross stitch again etc. 

It doesn't help that a (thankfully now former) friend made a comment when I was big into making gallery walls last year - trying to call me out on the fact that my interests change. F*** that guy 

I think what I've been doing is really trying to challenge those thoughts, by bringing them to the front of my mind and trying to see what the motivation behind them is. Also I just tell myself that I can do whatever the hell I want as long as I'm not hurting anyone"
relationship_advice,evcaugs,t3_cj8egj,1564410861.0,This post is bringing up a lot of emotions as I just had practically the same thing happen to me. Though I just haven't said anything to them - which I don't believe is the best course of action
