AskDrugNerds,fqd7njr,t1_fqd66lj,1589282474.0,"Fa sho! But do keep in mind, I am what they call a functional schizo, mean I have a relatively mild case. I can't even imagine what psychedelics would do to an individual who has it worse than me. Like, imo, LSD kind of induces schizophrenia. But not exactly. It's like when a normal person does LSD they kind of become schizophrenic, because how schizos are naturally is kind of like normal people on LSD. So someone with a particularly horrible case of schizophrenia doing LSD would either be particularly horrible in ways neither of us can begin to imagine, OR it would do the opposite. But because of how different people are and because each case of schizophrenia is so different it would be extremely difficult to use psychedelics as a general treatment. But, that what I wanna do. I'm in the process of getting a PhD in psychology so I can perform case studies of using psychedelics to treat many of the more hardcore mental illnesses. I'm so looking forward to it. It's going to be interesting, that's for sure."
AskDrugNerds,fqd5vyi,t1_fqd5jgd,1589280820.0,"Word up, my dude. But I would not say at all that I was on the edge of an episode, it absolutely came out of no where. But I believe that psychedelics and mental illness are both improperly represented in the main stream, and you are very correct- caffeine, nicotine etc will absolutely cause a similar psychosis but no one sees it that way because the psychosis they cause seem to be a relatively socially acceptable psychosis where as other mental illnesses, especially schizophrenia, are not socially acceptable. The world's a fucky place."
AskDrugNerds,fqd4xwt,t1_fqd4jfn,1589279888.0,"I'm not saying it was the cause of schizophrenia itself, but it definitely triggered an episode. And I DO agree with you. But honestly, I also believe it can be beneficial to continue the use of psychedelics after and during an episode. But that can be pretty dangerous based on the individual. Totally agree tho, mass amounts of benefits and the possibility of experiencing psychosis should not be a deterrent, and should definitely not be peddled the way it is."
AskDrugNerds,fqd3o3e,t1_fqd2eo1,1589278633.0,"I am schizophrenic. I had my first schizo episode as a teenager, but through the magic of delusions, I did not think it was anything major and I never told anyone. Ffw several years and I had very few signs of schizophrenia at all until I tried LSD when I was 24 ish. Maybe 25. I had a full on episode lasting 9 months and enough knowledge at this point to understand what was happening. So yes, LSD can cause episodes. So can thc. I whole heatedly agree that there is *some* propaganda, and fear mongering when it comes to mental health and psychedelics, but they absolutely can be a trigger. On the other side of that coin, psychedelics have helped me understand myself and my mental/emotional/physical health in ways I can't explain. So to say psychedelics are NOT a trigger is inaccurate. But to state that they are/will definitely be a trigger is equally so. But it is best to be prepared for an outcome in which psychosis may be triggered with the use of any drug, including alcohol."

I think the craziest thing I can remember is when I was 14 or 15 and doing a love spell. I had used a black candle (which was super dumb for a love spell) and set it in the middle of a pent and was staring at the flame just spacing out/meditating and out of nowhere my hand goes up and just slams down on top of the candle super hard. I have no idea why or how that happened but burnt the fuck out of my hand and had a blister that was a big bubble that came an inch out from my hand. Did get into a relationship less than a month after, and if you can imagine, he was a douche bag. xD wasn't my last love spell, the second one was even worse even if the spell itself was less dramatic, the 3rd one was actually really good. 

There was also an incident during a banishing, some kind of spook was living in a friend's witch cabinet and there were 3 of us with bundles of sage just doing the thing and all 3 caught fire at the same time. (They usually don't do that and definitely not three different bundles at the same time)

And more recently, I have a friend who is..... Unknowledgeable...... About the arts and he ended up getting involved with this really bad chick who was also a witch. Long story short, she was haunting him. She knew things that she shouldn't have been able to know and she fucked with his head so bad. He became incredibly paranoid and she was pretty much trying to make him kill himself. I basically summoned her on the astral realm and had a ""friendly chat"" and that same week she left the country and he's been fine ever since. He felt the difference the next day.

witchcraft,fm7rszl,t3_ftme80,1585835381.0,"Break the jar, state that you release the magic, visualize the energy becoming neutral (instead of dark energy) as it seeps into the earth and bury it off your property. (Dig a hole and break the jar inside of the hole you dug, then cover it up) Once it's buried, say something along the lines of ""the spell is complete, so mote it be"" and forget about it."

schizophrenia,fm7p8p6,t1_fm7nwsx,1585833658.0,"You shouldn't feel bad about taking medication.<3 They have helped a lot of people. I'm not really sure why I have such a hang up about them, but yeah, taking one prescription for the biggest problem I have doesn't sound that bad. I just need to find a doctor and talk to them about it and get more information on the type of prescription they'd recommend. If it helps me get good sleep and helps with the migraines and lack of energy, it sounds totally worth it. I'll work through my discomfort with it. And yes, going on several years just accepting I don't sleep has been absolutely awful. Part of me thinks that if I had someone to cuddle with I'd be able to sleep. (I started having these issues after my ex of 6 years and I broke up and I've been (mostly) single since. It's been about 5 years since that happened, and my entire life crumbled all at the same time, my father died, and my mother disowned me and there was all kinds of badness over the span of about 4 months, and I had my second sz episode during this time from all the stress.) But who knows."
schizophrenia,fm7h90b,t1_fm7gyyq,1585826937.0,"No, I don't take any meds but I've been seriously considering going in to at least get something for sleep, as I have completely exhausted any and all OTC sleep aids. I'm not an anti vaxer or anything but I have a phobia of prescription medications. But my sleep issues have been going on like this for years so I think it's probably past time to try one out. Bleh."

Idky but dick being rubbed all over my face and body is one of my favorite things. Just that will make me moan."
schizophrenia,fm7e9t1,t1_fm7e5gy,1585823718.0,"Right on! Lmk if it helps with the sleep, but I'd also be interested in hearing if it had the same cognitive effects for you as far as the brain fog goes:)"
Rapekink,fm7e6dr,t1_fm7e0xw,1585823612.0,"Good<3 Keep it up, love<3"
schizophrenia,fm7dvy6,t1_fm7dhvu,1585823277.0,"That sounds incredibly frustrating:( You should give glycine a try in conjunction with the sleeping meds you take, it might help. But yeah, the migraines are awful:("
schizophrenia,fm7dsmf,t1_fm7d3dk,1585823173.0,"Very cool! I think I'll try that visualization. Meditation has helped me in the past but, unfortunately, I am not a creature of habit and sticking to routine is pretty difficult. But maybe I'll try harder. At least with a bed time routine. Thanks!"
Rapekink,fm7dns5,t1_fm7d1e8,1585823020.0,"Well, that friend was also there when I lost my virginity, listening from another room, to him. I didn't realize it at the time but it was pretty rape-y too. He did not care at all about how it felt for me, didn't try to minimize pain at all, it was like he just wanted to hear me scream. And he was BIG. And no, she didn't and wouldn't have lost respect for me, and she laughed about how loud I was being, she thought it was funny, but didn't understand what really happened. I didn't either. Later I had her check out my naughty bits to see if I was bruised and/or bleeding. She was a good friend for a long time. But when she stepped in and stopped him she was kind of unsupportive because she could see how bad the relationship was even if I didn't. Some part of her may have thought I deserved it for being so naive. 

As far as staying with him.... I think how manipulative he was kept me there longer than I should have been. We were dating for three or so years. If he had raped me that time it would have been a wake up call. All the other times I didn't realize it was rape. I was young and inexperienced. If he had done it that time I would have ran for the hills. After that I spent maybe 6 more months with him but sex was very different and I wasn't into it anymore and also found out he had been cheating on me and the physical abuse escalated so no, it wouldn't have kept me with him unless he had really forced me to."
schizophrenia,fm7d3ui,t3_ftaqk9,1585822381.0,One of my hobbies is bojustu. You can teach yourself by just playing around or watching tutorials online. It's meditative and a good workout for arms and shoulders and it's a good form of self defense. It's a lot of fun and makes you feel like a bad ass too. xD
schizophrenia,fm7cl1e,t1_fm7cbwa,1585821790.0,"That's awesome! Happy to hear you are getting better sleep and SO JEALOUS that you can fall asleep in a couple minutes. But yeah, my longest streak was about 14-16 days without a minute of sleep. I'm so thankful that it's not that bad anymore, at least for now. And yes, I drink coffee almost daily. I've cut back a lot but I'm still at it. But it's like maybe 2 cups a day, down from 4 and usually I don't have any when I'm not working. I had some today on my day off trying to help the migraine and nausea tho.

What did you do to train yourself?"
schizophrenia,fm7bzu7,t3_ftjkth,1585821115.0,"I believe it was u/tedbradly who recommended glycine. Dude, HUGE THANK YOU!!"
Rapekink,fm77zyd,t3_fthveo,1585816607.0,"The first time I talked about things that happened with my ex was 10 years after it all ended. I had really bad anxiety, PTSD, disassociation, and irritability. Wish I could give you a hug. Just wanted to let you know that it'll pass. You'll get better. Working through these emotions are important for healing. Take care of yourself<3"
Rapekink,fm75gs8,t3_ftgifn,1585813952.0,"I have an ex boyfriend who was an abusive POS. I remember one time in particular that he got violent with me. He was mad that my best friend came over to hang out with me so often and we had gotten into a fight about it, and my argument was that ""I live here too and you don't let me leave so she has to come over"". The next morning when he was leaving for work, he woke me up to tell me ""Don't ever say that to me again"" and I sighed in annoyance, rolled over and said whatever. It quickly escalated into him grabbing me by my ankle and pulling me off the bed. I kicked him away from me, obviously that just made him angrier. He walked back over to me, fought my legs open and put himself between them and pinned me down my my wrists. I couldn't do anything. And I remember looking up at him and I literally watched his thought process go from being angry, to being turned on, to accepting the fact that he was about to violently rape me. The recognition I saw in his eyes was scary. Fortunately, my friend was there and when she heard the panic in my voice she came into the room and got him to leave. 

Thinking about the situation now, he was definitely on a power trip and was going to rape me just to make sure I knew who was dominant. I'm sure feeling how much power he had over me combined with the sex itself would have been pretty epic for him. At the time it would have destroyed me, but now, I almost wish she wouldn't have stepped in. Thinking about what could have happened is pretty hot tho. But I'm also glad he didn't get that satisfaction. At least not from me."
