BPD,fqt1ety,t3_gkskax,1589626629.0,"First off, I'm really impressed how much self-awareness is in this post. Congratulations for getting to a stage in recovery where that's possible! 

Secondly, getting over someone is tough. The toughest part about it is that things like this don't always have that sense of closure, the final event that helps us know that it's truly over. To move past this, you have to accept the reality that this loose end may never be tied, and that that's ok. And that you will continue to both miss and be angry at your ex-friend, and that that's ok too. A lot of it is really just acceptance. When you realize that everything you're going through is part of the process, it's much less daunting. Believe me, I've been through it, and there were times I was scared I would never heal. And there were times I wasn't even sure that I wanted to heal. But overtime, as you put your efforts and attention into other parts of your life and other people, your intense feelings over the situation and the person naturally fade. There are things I forgot about my ex-friend that I could've never imagined forgetting, but it happened without me even noticing it because life went on. Just keep making decisions that align with the goal to move forward -- not lurking on any of the ex-friend's social media, not reaching out to them, not keeping screenshots of things they've said, etc. The process will be rocky at first but will gradually become smoother and more manageable. 

When it comes to your girlfriend, you could always explain what an FP is. The reality is that an FP is someone you have an unhealthy and dependent attachment to, so it's a very consuming and difficult relationship to navigate. It's not easy to get over an FP, regardless of the nature of the relationship (platonic, romantic, etc). If she starts to worry, I'd explain this to her, noting that your feelings for your girlfriend are different in the sense that they are both healthy and romantic, while neither is the case for the feelings you have toward your ex-friend."
ENFP,fqkcrmb,t3_gjdsc9,1589424613.0,"You're not asking a lot by asking that he shows interest in you, your life, and your feelings. Don't settle for a one-sided relationship, and for sure don't apologize for asking for reciprocation."

Hopefully, if you process it (in a healthy way where you're identifying any distorted thoughts you're having over the issue), then you can both approach a resolution in a more tidy and effective way"
BPD,fmzusqp,t3_fyguz7,1586529978.0,"It's less about the depth of love and more about the boundaries of love. Media portrays the love that you previously experienced as the truest form of love, but that isn't the case. It's just a very unhealthy form of love in which you don't create healthy boundaries for the relationship nor for yourself. 

When you have no boundaries in a relationship, suddenly you NEED that person. You're no longer your own person because you're not truly ok until that person is around you. Your emotions are no longer your own because they're 100% dependent on whether or not that person is there. It's what media thinks is beautiful but is actually just harmful for both parties (the emotional rollercoaster for you, the immense pressure for the other person). 

A love where you like when the person is around, know them deeply, accept them, and appreciate them, but also know yourself and take responsibility for your own feelings, is the best kind of love. But if you're constantly looking for that emotional rollercoaster, then you'll miss out. You can't develop acceptance and appreciation and love if you're looking past the person and trying to find something more"

I've heard a lot of different things about INTPs, but overall it seems like our types may be on the same wavelength"
mbti,fhd45f9,t1_fhd1yk8,1581476911.0,"Well this could be inaccurate since it's coming from my observations as well as observations of others who've regularly interacted with ENFPs, but I'll give it a shot!

1. To others (who aren't Ne users), it seems like we have ""racing thoughts."" We don't feel this way, though, as we're just very used to our own thought processes. 
2. A lot of us have ADHD or ADHD-esque symptoms because of our ""racing thoughts,"" branching ideas, distractibility, and aversion to too much routine (which is probably a combination of Ne dom and Si inferior). 
3. We have a lot of traits that seemingly conflict with each other yet somehow coexist (being both broody and cheerful, both energized by dealing with others and drained when we don't get enough alone time, very loyal and very flighty, caring and having difficulty with feeling truly connected, etc. (This seems like it might be an NF thing in general)
4. Because of our conflicting traits, we tend to end up typing ourselves as many many *many* different types before arriving to the correct one. And we may still question it even afterwards. 
5. I've noticed that a lot of ENFPs actually feel (and sometimes are perceived) like introverted thinkers and sometimes mistype as INTPs (Though the Te is tertiary, it seems very present for a lot of ENFPs, especially those that are maybe more reserved with certain emotions)
6. This is probably controversial, but I think that we as ENFPs can be pretty sneaky. Subtly doing/saying things rather than being direct just to have plausible deniability. Doing whatever we know we can get away with. Sometimes crossing the line from being charming to manipulative even if we mean no harm. 
7. People think of us as empathetic, but I think we are naturally pretty selfish and/or self-centered. When we're empathetic, it's through intentional effort, not some natural reflex. 
8. Just like INFJs (and probably every other type), we oftentimes feel as if we aren't understood, and that can be a lonely feeling. 
9. We do tend to be very well-liked. I don't even act particularly extroverted unless I'm around people I already know, but it feels like I end up making friends no matter what setting I'm in. 
10. As such, we have a lot of friends, but only a few *real* friends that we trust and connect with. 

There are probably a lot more things, but hopefully this is enough to give you some idea of ENFP-isms"

But the concept of ""being myself"" feels very different for myself than it is for some others and for sure different from how ENFPs are portrayed. Like, do I not qualify as a legitimate ENFP if I heavily filter my personality even with close friends and family? Am I not a legitimate ENFP if it's hard for me to feel emotional connections to others even if they feel connected to me? These are of course questions that I'm not expecting you to be able to answer, but these are questions I ask myself when I see one side of ENFPs being explored (how remarkably open we supposedly are compared to others, for example) with no room for any other sides or traits.

People aren't here to be inherently interesting. If what you're looking for is someone to constantly hold your interest, then maybe it's better for you to start expanding your interests or actively asking about things that you find interesting. For example, I don't find surface-level topics interesting for the most part, so I ask deeper questions. When I see that people have patterns, though it makes them predictable, those patterns (that *everyone* has on some level) are what make them who they are. And *that's* interesting. Why do they have those patterns? Where have they learned them? Do those patterns work for them? How do they feel about those patterns? 

Something that can be viewed as boring, repetitive, and dry can be turned into an intriguing look into a person's identity. But you have to put in effort. Not everyone will dance around trying to be engaging or spontaneous for others to consume as if they're entertainment. If you want to build genuine and long lasting bonds, you have to be able to find comfort and interest in the mundane and predictable. The reality is that everyone has patterns and can be predictable once you figure out those patterns. But if all those patterns are to you is routine and little else, then of course you won't find value in them. But if you look at them as markers of value, identity, upbringing,etc, then there's a more in depth conversation to be had there."

intj,fgrtwoj,t3_egj2b2,1581057428.0,"Super late to responding to this post (I just stumbled on it while looking through the subreddit), but I wanted to respond anyway. 

First off, the reality is that anyone is capable of being unproductive, unreasonable, and inconsiderate. It really depends on their health level, maturity, and growth in general. 

Honestly, though, I'm wondering if this is an ENFP? As an ENFP, I can sometimes be a homebody too, but I love going out. But, I will say, I usually like going out more if it's less of an obligation and more of a fun activity. So, like, I may not want to go grocery shopping with someone, but if they invite me to hang out in general and we happen to go grocery shopping, I would be pretty keen to do so. So maybe, when you want to be productive and go out, you can frame it differently by inviting him to grab a treat and grocery shopping afterwards/on the way there. If even something like this wouldn't prod him to go out, I would really have to wonder if he's an ENFP or even an extrovert. 

Also, when it comes to him going out without you, it may be a good idea to just ask him if he'd be okay with including you every once in a while. It's likely that he just doesn't think you'd want to join since you're very introverted and don't prioritize those kinds of things. 

Lastly, when it comes to eating/exercising habits... I don't think that's an area of someone's life you should try to dictate. If the person is excessively unhealthy, like eating way too little or way too much, then I get it. But, otherwise, that's really their choice and if they're relatively fine, I don't think that should be anyone else's concern. 

In general, I understand that some things may end up being an issue in relationships. It's normal to find certain things irritating about others, especially people you may spend a lot of time with. I tried giving little tips for each problem you talked about, so maybe it'll come in handy? Also... you sure your bf is an ENFP? I'm genuinely curious"

BPD,fgnzars,t1_fgmzy65,1580956210.0,"Yes, I believe so! I used to split and reconnect with a past FP many many times, haha. But I think, to resolve splitting in a healthy manner, you have to look at the person (or people) involved in an objective way. I try to remember that the only reason why I'm having such an extreme reaction to the person is because they matter that much to me. I try to remind myself of what it is about them that makes me care about them. That way, I can start to look at them in a more balanced and less extreme way, at least for the moment. Recognizing when you're splitting is probably one of the hardest parts, so it's great that you're already aware! After that, it's about stepping into the wise mind"
BPD,fgl1mnr,t1_fgircls,1580879230.0,"Thank you! I think you're right. Recognizing the problem is the first step to solving it. And I get that feeling... Something like that recently happened to me, which is why I made this post actually. I was in a group and then I left, but I felt devastated because I actually was looking forward to building some real connections with these people"
BPD,fgl1jp2,t1_fgje97j,1580879160.0,How are you handling it? Are you feeling alright?
BPD,fghyz6v,t1_fg5d7n7,1580798455.0,I'm sorry you're feeling that way. I haven't had an FP in years which I'm really thankful for.  It's such a hard and intense experience.
BPD,fghywtf,t1_fg5ofdh,1580798387.0,"I'm sorry that you feel this way, but I'm glad to know that I'm not alone. I've always thought that I'm getting better with BPD, but I've been kind of shielding myself from the reality that all I do is avoid everything that triggers my BPD, including close relationships. It's just hard to confront those things, but I would like to be able to"

ENFP,fdhdzh4,t3_eleraf,1578420664.0,The only thing I can recommend is to become more aware of when you're engaging a lot with one or a few people and try to branch out. People can see your focused energy as favoritism or jumping from person to person. The best solution would probably be to not do this and just try to have a balanced and moderate attention to the people in your life

BPD,fcul69y,t3_ej0dya,1577983430.0,"I don't think you should get back together if she's not recovered enough to realize that her abuse of alcohol is an issue. It's not as if all of the problems will disappear because she's been diagnosed and is getting treatment. It's a process, and she might or might not be far enough along to have a stable relationship. Maybe you guys should just try being friends and you can see how stable she is from a safe distance. 

If you decide to get back together despite my warnings, then you need to be able to stand up for yourself and your boundaries 100% of the time. If she's overstepping boundaries while you're in a relationship of any kind, you need to let her know and be firm 10 times out of 10. If you can't do that, then you're better off not dating"

Enneagram,fcms2v6,t3_ehm6vx,1577789483.0,"9s and 4s are kind of the opposite in a number of ways. While they both may be disconnected from their identity, 4s are obsessed with the development and distinction of themselves. They feel very different from others, which isolates them, but they also embrace this by striving even further to be unique. 9s, on the other hand, don't feel this urgent need to figure out who they are. 

Also, they both are withdrawn types, but 4s withdraw from others to confront and deal with their emotions. 9s, sometimes, will withdraw even from themselves, choosing to ignore their own feelings if that means they can feel a bit more at peace."
