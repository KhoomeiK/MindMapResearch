depression,fgrhkda,t3_enrs4c,1581046988.0,"Its sad because I have so many people who I could talk to about my problems but Im afraid to. I'm afraid to kill the mood by telling people I want to die. Im afraid they will think Im joking or being over dramatic. And in the long run, it makes me feel that much lonelier to know I cannot be comfortable with anyone enough to tell them the truth."
SuicideWatch,fgrgpiz,t3_f04g85,1581046382.0,"What always helps me is to listen to the stories of suicide attempt surivivors. Almost always, they say that half way through they didnt want to die anymore. Its not a permanent solution by any means, and it never takes the thought of suicide from my mind. But it helps me put it off one day at a time."
