DoesAnybodyElse,fonv6k1,t3_g8f691,1587927094.0,This is so weird I was JUST thinking about how this has been happening to me!! Thought I was the only one. I wonder why this is happening?
needadvice,fo96ebn,t1_fo7nybc,1587611606.0,"It wasn’t that customers left surveys saying I wasn’t great, it was the amount of surveys I’d gotten (or lack thereof). As a department, we are supposed to hit a certain goal each month. I wasn’t performing at my best during that one difficult month and I didn’t meet the required amount of surveys. Not my best, but also not enough to justify his actions."

TrueCrime,flm6ara,t1_flj1mes,1585275586.0,"I was there a few times as a spectator with my mom! The trial was open to the public for a while until it became too much of a frenzy, so they ended up closing it off to outside spectators. Her bad energy filled the entire room, it was a really unsettling atmosphere. I remember at one point there was some commotion from a spectator and everyone turned to look, including Jodie. Seeing her face up close and in person genuinely made my stomach turn. It’s true what everyone said about her eyes, they were absolutely dead and cold. She looked so sinister while at the same time trying to maintain that “in control” demeanor."
