dating_advice,fosaunn,t3_g9arby,1588027136.0,"You don't need to do any of those things to have an interesting life. And to be honest, you don't need to have an interesting life. You just need to have a life you enjoy.

So, do you have things you enjoy doing? If not, pick up a few new hobbies. For me, during this quarantine and having no job, I picked up cross stitching and guitar. I would play cello (Been playing for 20 years now) but I left it at my parents' and since I moved out, I can't go visit them until this quarantine is over.

Find things to read or to watch, go for walks, explore your city or your area, work out, connect with your friends online by playing games together or something.

Drinking, smoking, doing drugs, and having a lot of sex just for the sake of having sex, will not make your life more fun or interesting. And to be honest, having multiple sex partners leads to more problems in relationships for a lot of people.

Don't give up your values because of society's pressure on people to do stupid and crazy things for the ""thrill"" of it. You'll find someone who will love you for who you are and doesn't care at all that you're a virgin.

Keep finding people you can connect with and eventually things will fall into place. Maybe you have to put yourself out there more, but don't change the aspects of yourself that make you stand out and make you who you are just to appear ""cool"" to others."

I usually apply my product directly in the shower, but on this day I had class at noon and I knew, even with a dryer, that it would not dry even to 50%, so I wanted to do it later in the evening. But I think I will go back to applying the products right away.

Wavyhair,fjgcklr,t1_fjgb2zl,1583321991.0,"Hi! I only use the denman brush when I have conditioner or product in, I haven't noticed it stretching out my waves at all. 

Actually I used to think scrunching too much would do that too, but since using the deep conditioning treatment (this is my second time) my wet frizz and general frizz have gone down. I also noticed that scrunching more for the back helps define them (before l they were practically straight) but for the top/front it doesn't make a difference.

I have the shea moisture curl cream (the peach one), but I wanted to take a break from it to see if my hair was getting glycerin overload or just generally weighed down. I think I will add it back next washday because I find it does help make tue waves last longer.

I don't really have that problem with gel, but I think after I've finished this bottle, I will try a mousse to see if it holds better.

Thank you for the compliment :) I'm pretty happy because recently my hair was going limp and super dry, but now it seems to be coming back. I just wonder if getting layers would help..."
Wavyhair,fjg1uc1,t3_fd9m7o,1583307830.0,"I think I finally figured out a routine for myself, also I was lacking in protein way more than I thought I was.

Routine:

Yesterday morning I shampooed my hair with a sulfate shampoo (alverde sensitiv shampoo - it's not the greatest but I will keep using it until I run out and maybe try a non-sulfate shampoo), then I used a deep conditioner just for 3-5 mins while plopping in a shower cap (balea oil repair schwerelos creme-kur). Then I combed through with wide tooth comb and let it airdry.

Later in the evening I re-wet my hair, added some Garnier papaya hair food as a leave-in, used my denman brush to distribute evenly. Then I squeezed out some water, and again used my denman brush to train my curls/waves, then I gently smoothed over gel (balea powerflex gel) all over my hair, and scrunched in for like 15 mins at least. I let it airdry, wasn't fully dry when I went to bed, but I pinneapled and put in a satin bonnet. This is the result after scrunching out the crunch!

Next washday I'm going to try finger coiling since I've noticed it works sometimes.

Does anyone have any recommendations for improvement, or should I get a hair cut/layers? Feel like my hair looks kinda weird but idk what to do with it lol

Oh if this helps, I have medium density, thick, low porosity hair!"

&#x200B;

I really suggest you go talk to an advisor. I did that and it gave me an idea of what the program would be like. From what I understood, it's a lot more hands-on, meaning more to do with actually filming, rather than screenwriting (though there are classes on that, of course).

&#x200B;

SkincareAddiction,f234507,t3_db7kel,1569905408.0,"I suggest getting rid of or deactivating your social media accounts, especially Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat. I got rid of Facebook three years ago completely because I was so tired of seeing everybody's ""perfect"" life, and it seriously depressed me. I made a new account just last month because I went on an exchange in Germany and made a lot of friends I want to keep in contact with, but the last time I actually looked at my Facebook was two weeks ago, for less than ten minutes. I also hardly look at my Snapchat anymore, and I've deleted Instagram. It has seriously helped with my confidence a lot.

&#x200B;

For youtube, I suggest you subscribe to channels that inspire you in one of your hobbies/passions, idk that sounds corny I know, but for me for example, I follow a lot of filmmaking/screenwriting channels. I used to follow a few skincare, beauty related channels and when I unsubscribed, I felt insanely better. I only follow like two or three channels about health, but they're focused on fitness and not on makeup or fixing acne. 

&#x200B;

And lastly, talk to your family, to your gf, about how you feel. Don't bottle it up; let people know you are hurting, because they want to help you. 

&#x200B;

Oh, and something someone once told me that I tell myself when I start getting super self conscious and anxious when I'm out in public: everybody else is way too focused on how they look that they are not looking at the flaws you think you have. People are freaking out about their own acne, fine lines, wrinkles, discolouration, etc, worried that you'll notice and judge them for it."

&#x200B;

My best advice is to not engage. If she tries to start an argument or fight with you, just calmly respond and try to walk away as quickly as possible. Try to spend less time at home, if possible. And don't tell her any personal information about yourself or cry in front of her, because as you've already said, she will use that against you (mocking you for crying).
