relationship_advice,fahuat7,t3_e98hgf,1576093644.0,"This is exactly how my high school boyfriend would treat me when I said no to sex. And he wanted to be a psychiatrist later in life. Your GF is not handling this right at all and being emotionally abusive towards you. This is not your fault and not your responsibility to fix. 

I wish that I could tell you that she can change and that things will get better. But she has to want to change and it really doesn’t seem like she sees any problems with her behavior or any inclination to get better. You need to get yourself out of that situation as it can’t be good for your mental health, I know that it wasn’t for mine."
SeattleWA,f3z0p7h,t3_disye6,1571261579.0,"Burien is pretty affordable and not too long of a commute into Seattle, it helps if you leave a little early but I don’t think it would be longer than 30 minutes with traffic"

Some people can make the distance work and some can’t, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t love each other. Do what you think will make you happy! She shouldn’t guilt you into staying in the relationship."

dating,etasrxq,t3_caih1t,1562628233.0,"I ended a three year relationship with a really great, sweet guy who was my best friend because of the exact same thing a few years ago (both of us in our early 20s). It was a hard, demoralizing decision because I’d imagined us getting married and living together at some point. But at the end of the day it wasn’t what I needed and wanted out of a relationship. Sometimes you have to make the hard decision that’s right for you. 
I hope that you find someone who is more compatible with you!"
