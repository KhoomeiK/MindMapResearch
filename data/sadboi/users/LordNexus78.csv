Anxiety,fj5zvjd,t3_fbq6n2,1583049945.0,"You're not alone in the slightest. Barely left my dorm room this week. I'm incredibly lonely, but the thought of bringing myself to socialize with others or go outside is a nightmare. I know there's a party coming up that I'll be invited to, but I also know I'll end up staying home anyway. My living space is a mess and I've spent all my time either staring at the ceiling thinking about how terrified and alone I feel, or trying to keep myself distracted via youtube. You're 100% not alone. Weirdly comforting to know that I'm not either. I hope you find a way out of this vicious cycle."

insaneparents,f47t9pz,t3_djq899,1571427632.0,"Forgive my insolence, not doubting your story completely, just seems kinda weird to me that you're a 15yo college student when a month ago you were a 16yo college student and that despite being a 6'4"" attractive home schooled dual enrolled genius who regularly scores 100% on exams (to the point where you're concerned your professors may think you're cheating), you can't spell the word Christian properly. Seems a little larger than life. Doesn't help your case that you admit to wanting to control and manipulate others. Just some observations."
Anxiety,f3a6dsm,t1_f39s0bu,1570762872.0,"Thank you very much for the response. I like the idea of just letting myself feel uncomfortable for a bit at a time, and the mantra is also a good idea. You're probably right about strangers being lower pressure. My friends usually make a big deal out of it whenever I don't happen to have a hoodie on (""Wow, you have arms??"" and some comment about how ""scandalous"" I must be feeling are common responses), and that definitely amplifies that feeling of exposure by a lot. It sucks because I want to change, and I feel like this coping method is probably contributing to the lack of change in my life. It's clear to me that they don't have any bad intentions, but having everyone stare and hype it up it when I make an effort just makes me feel like I've been put on the spot and makes me want to go back to being unnoticed. Hopefully trying this around strangers can help me loosen up before I try around friends. Thank you for the advice."
