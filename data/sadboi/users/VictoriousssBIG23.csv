Why is it that when people try to be positive and practical, it's met with resistence?

Herd immunity might be our only way out. If we let the healthy people get it and recover, it protects people like you and hopefully we find a vaccine or a cure in the meantime. 

I'm not trying to be mean or anything. I really do hope you stay safe and don't get the virus! I've just read a lot of studies on the IFR and other data and I think a lot of the models got it wrong.

LockdownSkepticism,fqucrxu,t3_gkrnm7,1589656466.0,"I did my undergrad internship at a day program for people with schizophrenia and I often find myself wondering how the clients are coping during this time. Most of them lived in group homes where they only left to attend the day program twice a week and the occasional supervised outing to a restaurant, store, movie theater, or bowling alley. I'm not sure if the day program is still doing in person sessions, my internship ended last year, but it wouldn't surprise me if they're not since most outpatient mental health services are suspended. The little field trips are most definitely over for the time being. It makes me feel so sad for those guys. All of them are older, like 50s/60s and many of them have pre-existing conditions on top of the schizophrenia that puts them at a higher risk for COVID so it makes sense that extra precautions should be taken to protect them, especially since it would spread like wildfire in the group home, but I still worry about how the isolation will affect their mental health. They're already pretty isolated as is since most of their families cut them off years ago. 

Most of them are already really distrustful of the government. I had one guy tell me that the army planted a microchip in his arm. There was another guy who believed that the government was using satellites to monitor us and make us sick. He also believed that machines were taking over our minds. This is with heavy medication. I could only imagine how terrified they must be seeing people walking around with masks and all the talk about conspiracy theories. To logical people like us, it's easy to dismiss conspiracy theories like 5g and the microchipping in vaccines one, but to people who already suffer from delusions and are very very distrustful of most authority figures? To them, this shit is very believable. Even if you remove conspiracy theories from the equation, you still have the mainstream media spreading misinformation that is terrifying to the average person. Talk about never shaking hands again, apocalyptic doom, lockdowns, virtual everything for 2 years, COVID possibly not going away (which is probably true although the media makes it into a bigger deal than it actually is), contact tracing and forced quarantine, ect. If I was a schizophrenic person living in a group home and watching the news say that stuff, I would probably end up being sent to the crisis center. Thankfully, they don't really have access to social media so they can avoid most of the ""nuttiness"", but I hope they're not watching much of the news either since ethical journalism is damn near dead. As much as these guys need to be protected, they also need to not be isolated. We're failing those guys and people like them. They hated the mental hospitals and jails because they were caged up like fucking animals. Now, they're living in an environment that is supposed to be ""free-er"" but then they're told by the government, WHO THEY ALREADY DON'T TRUST, that they can't fucking leave? That's seriously fucked up. It's sad that I feel like I am the only one completely outraged by this.

It was a bunch of people enraged at the possibility of Jeff Bezos becoming the first trillionaire as Amazon sales skyrocket during the lockdown. Yet these same people are the ones who are super pro-lockdown until there's a vaccine who scream at others for even leaving their house. The same people who are partly responsible for the closure of many small businesses that cannot function under lockdown/new regulations. These hypocrites want to cry about Jeff Bezos and Amazon while happily buying groceries and whatever else they ""need"" from Amazon. 

But yes. Blame capitalism. It is capitalism that failed us. It couldn't possibly be a huge economic shutdown that put millions out of work and thousands out of business forever because of a slightly deadly virus. No, that had NOTHING at all to do with it. Oh and there are some people gleefully calling for a new world order to be implemented as a result of the pandemic, proving that some of these people really do want this to be bad so they can push an agenda as opposed to actually caring about lives.

MelanieMartinez,fqgxyx5,t3_gcmo3n,1589361045.0,"I love the idea for this thread! I really enjoy discovering new artists and helping other people discover artists that I like so reading these kinds of threads are fun. 

People already mentioned Lana, Billie, and Marina so I'm just seconding those recommendations. I consider all of them to be in the same alt-pop realm as Mel. Some other popular alt-pop artists that I'd recommend are Halsey and Lorde. I discovered Halsey through my Mel station on Pandora and I fell in love. Her Badlands era is probably her best era if you're more into the alt sound. Her newer stuff is more mainstream but it's still really good. In fact, I think Manic is a fantastic album that could surpass Badlands as my favorite. Her and Mel have similar breathy voices. Lorde basically popularized the alt-pop trend. She was the 2013 version of Billie in the sense that Royals was everywhere. Definitely check out her Pure Heroine album if you haven't. 

Now some of the lesser known artists:

Kailee Morgue- She's my newest ""secret"" now that Mel is more popular. She has a higher voice, but it's still breathy. She's currently working on her debut album, I believe, but she has a handful of songs already out. Ghost of Mine seems to be the most popular. Siren and Medusa are also really good.

Au/ra- She has a deeper voice that isn't as breathy, but an alt aesthetic. She's also very young, like 16, I think. Very underrated. Check out her song Assassin. Both the original and the Hippie Sabatoge remix. Panic Room seems to be her most popular. 

Sasha Sloan- I think she'll be huge in a couple of years. Her music isn't too similar to Mel's, but it's very brooding and sad. She definitely fits into the ""sad girl"" role very well. I'd recommend The Only since it hits deep during quarantine, as well as Dancing with Your Ghost. 

Emilie Autumn- She hasn't really been active in music for the past six or so years, but I have to bring her up since she's technically how I got into alt-pop. She sounds nothing like Melanie, but they are similar in that Emilie's music is based around a theme and a character. Opheliac is her best and most well known song, but I also liked Liar and Gothic Lolita. Just a warning, but she's a very acquired taste. She's like the ""goth"" Lady Gaga, but with more classical elements in her music. 

That's all I really have for now. Also, there's a website called music-map where you type in an artist's name and it gives you a list of similar artists. The closer the names, the more similar the music is so you could try that to find other artists with a similar vibe. 💖"

Whyyy is this such a big problem that a childfree subreddit sees multiple posts about it a day? I really don't get the mindset behind these parents. I understand that not everybody reads bios, but if you're at the point where you're actually having a conversation with someone and plan to go on a date with them, the least you could do is read the fucking bio! Hell, I even understand not mentioning kids in your bio or having pictures with them because pedophiles lurk everywhere and they've been known to target single parents on dating apps, but still. Why do people even try hiding this fact for a long period of time? 

Sure, dating as a single parent is hard, but it's not impossible. There are plenty of people out there who don't have kids, but wouldn't mind dating someone who has them. I have a coworker who doesn't have any kids of her own yet, but she loves kids and is willing to accept her boyfriend's kids. There are other single parents out there who are fine with having a blended family and understand the struggle. You might not get as many matches as a single parent as you would if you were single, but it's better to have 50 matches of people who are genuinely compatible with you compared to 100 matches of people who will likely unmatch you after hearing the truth anyway. I just don't see a point in lying or pestering childfree people to the point where they almost feel guilty for not giving you a chance. Why would you want to date someone who can't accept a major part of you? I wouldn't want to date someone in active duty military, but I'm not going to go around on Tinder and match with people who are very obviously in the military and pester them to quit so we can go on a date. I'm polycurious. If I were to find myself single again, I would state that in my bio because it's pretty fucking important. I'm not going to wait until I'm 10 pages into the conversation to be like ""oh yeah, btw I'm polycurious and I would like to date multiple people"" because it's disingenuous. I just don't get what goes through these peoples' heads."

childfree,fqd1h2r,t1_fqcpnpl,1589276374.0,"I'm kind of torn on this issue, tbh. I consider myself a feminist and I like to believe that women can do both and do it well. In fact, I've met many amazing, well accomplished, and successful career-driven women who happen to be mothers. However, these women are almost all older and their children are in their teens/twenties. Meanwhile, I haven't met many younger (I'm 25, so around my age range) women who can say the same. Part of me wonders if it's a generation gap thing: the older women that I know were new mothers during a time when it was acceptable to leave your kid for hours at a time, having a career was emphasized, and being a stay at home mom was discouraged/looked down upon. As a child who grew up in the 90s/2000s, it was considered healthy to not be attached at the hip of your kid 24/7 and most of my friends had moms who worked. With my generation, it seems as though we've gone backwards and now women are expected to pick career or kids. Being away from your child is considered ""unhealthy"" and more women seem to just aspire to be stay at home mothers, even if they have a degree. Or maybe it's because of the child's age. A baby requires more attention than a teenager so I would expect the mom of a teenager to work more than the mom of a newborn. Even still, those women I know have PhDs and I would assume they obtained those while their kids were still young just based on their ages, so I wonder why this discrepancy exists. 

Either way, it's my worst nightmare to spend all this money on a degree and not even use it because I have to take care of a screaming, crying thing for multiple years. Then to also be told that I can't accomplish any of my goals or live out my dreams on top of that is enough to make me not want that choice."

People from other countries will travel into New Zealand, bringing it with them and causing another outbreak that will likely be even worse than the initial outbreak since so few people are immune, or people from New Zealand will travel to another country and bring the virus back with them after contracting it overseas. The only way to make sure the virus never comes back to the country would be to essentially hold the population hostage and lock down the boarder for a really really long time. No one in, no one out. That isn't sustainable longterm. Tourism is a huge industry over there, as well as entertainment because a decent amount of movies have filmed in NZ. Plus, musicians who live over there would probably like to tour, and musicians over here would probably want to tour over there. That's not even counting other professions where travelling is required for business. NZ's economy would be completely shot if they kept the boarder closed. They'd have to do so until there's a vaccine, which might never come, so it's better to just brace for the storm now.

I was kind of worried that her career trajectory would be kind of like Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera's (the pop queens when I was 4/5 years old) where she would fall off after her peak and then struggle with getting her newer music to chart, essentially making her more of a ""legacy"" act. I really think Gaga's message of acceptance and positivity really resonates with people, especially younger ones. Gaga has always put her heart into her music so I have no doubt that once this coronavirus stuff settles down, she's going to make it up to us and slay this era! 

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I know it's long and rambling, but I felt like I needed to share it during these times. :) Also, if/when you get a chance to see her live, GO. You will not regret it. Gaga is one of the best live performers I have ever seen and I've been to A LOT of concerts over the past few years. I remember walking past an elderly couple in the crowd and they were saying something along the lines of ""I'm not sure if I'll enjoy this concert because I'm not really into this kind of music"" and the usher, who was an older man, said ""she's an amazing performer.

childfree,fpizygp,t3_gdpwvq,1588652861.0,"Tbh, I watched 16 & Pregnant back when it was on air and I watch Young and Pregnant now and I think that those shows did a really good job at showing the real struggles of teen motherhood. The financial struggles, deadbeat baby daddies, your friends basically wanting nothing to do with you because you can't be a normal teenager anymore, having to give up many of your hopes and dreams, ect. I don't think the reality shows glorify it at all. If a girl gets pregnant to ""be on MTV"" then she was probably going to get pregnant young anyways because, well, that's just stupid. Teen Mom is a little different. That show started off showing the real struggles of teenage motherhood, but it's pretty much now evolved into a ""Real Houswives of Teen Mom"" type show with the girls making 6 figures for doing nothing all day. Plus, the child abuse accusations from some of the cast members and domestic violence don't help. I've been watching for 10 years and I wish they would just can Teen Mom and keep Young and Pregnant so girls can get a more realistic picture. 

I do think that society has a problem with glorifying any problematic pregnancies with this ""all babies are a blessing!"" mindset. It's not just teen mothers, but it's also drug addicts, people with genetic disorders, and various other women who just flat out shouldn't be mothers."
childfree,fpiy27i,t3_gd07vh,1588651469.0,"It always bothers me when I see an article or a news story about woman dying and people almost ALWAYS relate it back to motherhood somehow.

The news stories that came out after would mention things like ""It's so sad she never got to be a mother. She loved kids and wanted to be a mother more than anything in the world."" Umm, I think it's more sad that she will never get to do anything that she had planned for her future or accomplish any of her goals. Why was being a mother the most important one to mention? She was a college student, too. She will never get to walk across the stage with her degree. She will never peruse a career in the field she wanted to go into. She will never see her friends, family, and dog again. All because some piece of shit felt entitled to her and was angry that he couldn't have her. That is the true tragedy here. She was robbed of all of her opportunities and her fucking LIFE, not just motherhood, but I guess that's not as endearing to the news? 

I see it all the time in headlines. ""30 year old mother of 3 dead in car crash!"" ""40 year old mother of two dies of COVID!"" ""Mother hurt in tragic accident!"" Why are we emphasizing motherhood in women who have died?! You never see fathers treated the same way. With men, usually you see more headlines like ""50 year old doctor dead in car crash"" and then the article itself will mention ""he leaves behind a loving wife and 3 kids"". Why are women reduced to so little that even in death, their role as a mother or a potential mother is emphasized more than who she was as a person?? I genuinely don't get it."

LadyGaga,fpfpvvu,t3_gc2c5g,1588579219.0,"The Fame. Oh man, I guess you could consider me an OG fan, but I do have a confession to make. I didn't care for ""Just Dance"" when I first heard it on the radio. I was in, like, 8th grade and going through my emo phase so I only listened to rock and screamo. I wrote everything else off as trash. So when I first heard ""Just Dance"" I thought ""idk who this Lady Gaga person is, but she's probably just gonna be another flash in the pan pop star that we'll never hear from again"". Then ""Poker Face"" came out and I was like ""hey, I actually really like this song!"" Then ""Paparazzi"" came out and I fell in love. The Fame and The Fame Monster were the soundtracks to my first two years of high school. I was obsessed with Gaga and couldn't wait to see what she did. I remember sitting by the computer, waiting for her music videos to premier. I talked about her constantly to the point where I'm sure those who were close to me got sick of hearing it. The funny thing is, people made fun of me for loving her so much because she was ""weird"" and I would just say ""you'll see, some day she's gonna come out and surprise all of you"" (which happened during the A Star is Born era. Suck on that, all you haters who laughed at me). 

Born This Way, however, changed my life. That album still means SO much to me. Even though I was already a Little Monster, that album helped give me confidence to pursue my own musical desires and be myself. I know that sounds cheesey, but it's true. I still think that's her best album/era. I still have the shirt and I wore it just the other day. That album was just so versatile and it defined Gaga as an artist. I honestly think she got snubbed for ""artist of the decade"" because Born This Way was such a moment for pop music in the early 2010s. So many pop songs from the early 2010s took inspiration from Gaga's sound and many artists were inspired by her look. 

I was a freshman in college when Artpop came out. I think I got it for Christmas that year and I was a little disappointed in it. This seems to be a consensus amongst Gaga fans. I liked a couple of songs (ironically, Do What U Want was one of them), but something about that album just didn't hit with me. I was kind of going through another phase at this time where I was pretending to be something that I was not, so Gaga kind of fell off for me and I started listening to more ""mainstream"" and ""club"" music. Applause and Do What U Want were the only two songs off of that album that got radio play so if it didn't appear on the radio, I likely didn't listen to it. I did watch and love her season of AHS, though. A couple of years went by and in 2016, I grew out of that phase and started listening to more indie/rock/alt stuff again. I saw that Gaga had released a new album so I decided to check it out. I was so impressed by Joanne! It had some great pop bops that we all know and expect from Gaga, but it also had more tender and emotional moments. I feel like that era kind of captured where my life was at that time and Gaga grew as I grew. It's my favorite album behind Born This Way and The Fame Monster. It reminded me of why I loved Gaga so much and my love for her has been reignited. I'm really excited for her new era. I hope she eventually releases more tour dates so I can go see her again (when we're allowed to do so, of course). ""Stupid Love"" reminds me of her older songs so much, just with better production quality. I love the fact that I've been on this journey with her for 12 years. It's been such a wild ride, but it's been worth it. :)"

Also, people in open relationships generally don't threaten people with lawyers or cease and desist letters when the other person talks. So I'm gonna go with option B. Idk why Corey just doesn't stay single since he clearly likes it that way."

In reality, the ground is a mere 3ft below the edge of the rock and most of the pictures are staged. I think it's called Pedra de Telegrafo."

It just means more fun for people like us because we'll be spending less time waiting in lines."
LockdownSkepticism,fp3pec6,t1_fp1c5wf,1588283401.0,"Unfortunately, I can confirm that most of the people who post pro-mental health stuff are just doing it to virtue signal and seem like a good person who cares. They don't actually care. I've had legitimate mental health problems for most of my life and these people are oddly quiet whenever I reach out for help. ""If you're feeling depressed and suicidal, please reach out to me! Even if I don't know you, I will help!"" And then when you do reach out, it's crickets."
