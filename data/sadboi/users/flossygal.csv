I have a small group of friends that I hold dearly but many of my friendships end up fizzling out. I start to wonder - sure part of it is being bipolar. But I do think naturally, some friendships just don‚Äôt last. Some friendships need more effort than others. There are different expectations. 

I‚Äôm fairly stable now. So I‚Äôm making an effort to really consciously devote time to my relationships. I also want to promise myself if I ever feel depressed again. To just send a ‚Äúautomated message‚Äù of ‚Äúhi, sorry I can‚Äôt come to the phone. I‚Äôm not ignoring you. I am just overwhelmed right now and need some time. I appreciate you thinking of me.

AsianParentStories,fcmc2ka,t3_ehpt2g,1577770088.0,"GET OUT. As fast as you can. I moved away from university. I worked two jobs in high school to save up. Got a couple scholarship. Took out the rest in loans. This was my logic - I can get away from my parents AND have a chance at a better future.

I realize that this is not a feasible option for everyone but there are options.
1)  Get a roommate
2) Subsidized housing
3) Living with a relative

If you do find that you have to stay, please make a plan to leave eventually. 

In the meantime: 
1) Spend as little time as you can at home. I worked 2 jobs and was always busy with school or extracurriculars. I took a job touring so I was only home 2 days a week. 

2) Gray Rock Method - becoming emotionally non-responsive. Don‚Äôt talk to them unless you have to. When you do - stick to boring topics such as the weather. If they ask questions give short answers that prevent further conversations. Don‚Äôt talk about your personal life. There is lots of information on  this method and I encourage you to look it up."

People don‚Äôt always share back, but it‚Äôs not personal. I try to not share things too similar to what I‚Äôm trying to sell (but I don‚Äôt know if that does anything.

poshmark,f1fco81,t3_d96m1f,1569441607.0,"I only started a few months ago. So far it‚Äôs been decent. I sell 100% out of my closet because:
1) I am a recovering shopaholic
2) Marie Kondo
3) I‚Äôve been size 0-12
4) My style has changed

I have a mix of fast fashion items and low-mid tier brands. IMO Poshmark isn‚Äôt the place for luxury items.  

Shipping is expensive so I try to account for that when pricing my items.

I also account for offers and negotiation. What works for me is pricing it a bit more than I want but not too much that it is unreasonable. 

I do shop thrift and consignment often for myself so I try to look at things objectively. How much would I spend on this item (with shipping included)? 

Of course, my goal is to recoup some $$, and not necessarily make a profit. So if that is your goal, this strategy may not work. BUT I have sold items way more than I paid for them."
poshmark,f1fbv7n,t3_d93t01,1569441099.0,"I imagine it is difficult to make a living wage off Poshmark. I mean it‚Äôs possible but not within reach for the most of us. I have a chronic illness that I work around by being self employed - with Poshmark being my lowest stream of income.

Still, I am making only 1/4 of my salary previously. I have a partner that earn a reasonable income and we leave comfortably within our means. 

We do take advantage of deals, and savings in almost all the aspects of our life. We shop sales, collect points, and buy in bulk."

My closet only at most had 30 active listings. I sell between 1-5 items a week. 

I share my closet 2 times a day.
I reshare whenever I have a spare moment - I treat it like I‚Äôm window shopping and share things I think are nice but aren‚Äôt for me for whatever reason - not my size, already have similar items, not in my budget.  

I have a few of followers that repost my items consistently and I always consistently share their items - almost every single day. 

Posh is unpredictable. I know many would say you need X listings to sell. While I do agree more listings = more sales theoretically. I suggest to not let it stress you and overwhelm.

1) take nice photos
2) make quality listing
3) engage naturally"
