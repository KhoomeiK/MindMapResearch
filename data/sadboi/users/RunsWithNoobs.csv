JordanPeterson,fjzwo34,t3_fac9j1,1583731977.0,"I'm late, but I understand what you're getting at. I think it's important to understand that Dr. Peterson suffers from anxiety and depression on his own, stemming from his family as opposed to life issues on their own. What this means is that he has a degree of trouble managing his anxiety as is, yet has been able to push them aside to achieve success and meaning in his life. The situation with his wife came about later, after he had published his book ""12  rules for life"" as I understand. The way you assert your question implies an underlying belief that Dr. Peterson had been preaching his advice while addicted to his medication, and that is not the case.

Furthermore, why would his use of medication bring his insights into question? He has often stated that medication can help you recover if you are in really dire straits, which he absolutely was given his underlying conditions as well as those of his current life, which are still rather recent. Having eyes on you all the time and being depended upon are heavy burdens, and to potentially lose your greatest support in the middle of it? It's too much to handle on your own. He reached out for help from a doctor, and he wound up being unable to stop using the pills on time. It's not as though he were telling his AA group to get off the sauce while he chugged away every night. He lived by his principles, a good and respectable life, and was set upon by an influx of negative emotion that he could not combat on his own. That's life."

I enjoyed the romance sections of Fanfiction.net as a kid(I was bookish), which naturally led to lemons, which eventually led to video porn. I never jerked until my first ever gf introduced me to phone sex (we were both 15). So many poor decisions."
JordanPeterson,fjjcvb6,t3_f5tnyr,1583390731.0,A part of every villain is necessary to the hero in some way. It's their inner monster made manifest.

Pathfinder2e,fi2vznw,t1_fhqg6nh,1582090859.0,You want to recieve divine aid from a good deity as an evil character? Explain to me how that makes sense.
Pathfinder2e,fi2vrth,t1_fhpqjos,1582090657.0,5e also makes spontaneous casters pointless and useless as they have fewer spells to use and no leg up on the others.
Pathfinder2e,fi2uv9b,t1_fhpmfde,1582089830.0,"I have to disagree with advantage/disadvantage. It being so prevalent more or less negates any kind of character bonus. It turns a 1 into a 20, and 20 into a 1 in one swing. Even if your character is really good at something, the best on the team, disadvantage can ruin your day. Worst of all, it isn't even reserved for special instances. It's essentially saying ""Hey GM, do you want this to succeed or not?"" It's either too harsh or too kind, never is it fair."

mutantsandmasterminds,fh5dfuw,t3_exz367,1581287833.0,I just submitted. Hopefully I'll talk to you all soon!
offmychest,fg3jxya,t1_fg3955y,1580483328.0,"Thanks for your reply. And yeah, your second paragraph is more or less what that last rejection helped me to figure out. I've had exactly one girlfriend since the first rejection (freshman year of highschool), but it wasn't really about the relationship itself, more about lust. Needless to say, that ended pretty poorly, haha.

To clarify, the apology is more because of my inability to really read people's signals and my tendency to outright ignore them when I can't see them. 

Thinking back on it, it was much creepier than I made it sound. At least to me.

But anyway, sorry to ramble. Have a nice rest of your day."
Pathfinder2e,fe75wo7,t1_fe711g7,1578910488.0,Not necessarily. If you position yourself properly they'll need a bit more to escape from you. If any of your frontline fighters have AoO it can get pretty nasty for the enemy. It's all about positioning really.

Pathfinder2e,f17cl76,t1_f164v9i,1569240705.0,"The character type of one who survives going down better than others is exactly what toughness and diehard are there to emulate. There would be a pretty big issue if the barbarian, fighter and monk just could not possibly die in an encounter because their Con modifier made passing a death save easy. There's supposed to be tension in that moment that your character goes down, it's the main reason you always want some form of healing handy."

Pathfinder2e,eyxz94c,t1_eyxx7jv,1567566510.0,"If you're frontline fighter (Let's be honest here, you punch or stab things, of course you are.) You want at least 14 Con. All the damage in the world does nothing for you if you're dead lol."

Pathfinder2e,eyxv83d,t1_eytmfdt,1567563403.0,"If you're a class like the Monk you could have two 18s at lvl 5(In Str and Dex of course) if you choose to have both at 16. It may be beneficial to have your AC as Monk be a bit higher and your damage a little lower. You could also decided to have one stat a bit higher so that you can take a dedication and not be garbage in it(Like a fighter with the Wizard Dedication or some other strange combination). It's risky, but potentially very rewarding if you plan it right."
