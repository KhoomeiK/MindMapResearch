Most egregious of all to me is most people will actually believe that the show began as some sexist dated dribble. Sure it’s dated but the quality of the writing of many of the episodes are completely timeless, the first Doctor starts off pretty cranky in his first appearance but really softens up and becomes a nice old guy who has fun with his companions. Most people think he’s just always mean and on top of that now they think he’s sexist. I just really wish it wasn’t a 60’s Doctor they did this to since the 60’s are the least popular Doctor Who era despite being amazing (Patrick Troughton is personally my favorite Doctor). Basically just wanted to add to the conversation I’m not trying to stand-offish or anything I just wanted to add my own perspective on the matter.

Ultraman,flt5lp6,t1_flsvq34,1585459997.0,"I’m glad to have any excuse to talk about Ultraman! No I don’t think you need to watch Ultra Q to get Ultraman. As far as I can remember there’s only one explicit reference to Ultra Q made in the show. In episode 4 of Ultraman they reference having seen a specific monster in the past but other than that it doesn’t effect the episode at all as the rest of it plays out without relying on the Ultra Q reference except maybe one other part where they reference a fact about the monster that was discovered in the Ultra Q episode. But basically it’s not necessary at all and only that episode makes a direct reference in the dialogue to Ultra Q. If you’re so inclined you can watch episode 20 of Ultra Q before watching Ultraman, or you can just skip episode 4. But even then it’s likely not necessary, episode 4 mostly stands on it own. I don’t remember the Ultra Q episode since it’s been years but it might be worth watching that episode first if you’re nervous about it. I would go into more detail about what is referenced but it might be considered a minor spoiler for the Ultra Q episode. I will say though Ultra Q is referenced throughout the show in other ways. Two monsters are re-used costumes from Ultra Q monsters but that however has absolutely no effect on the plot or what the monsters are like since canonically they’re supposed to be different monsters anyways. The only other effect Ultra Q has on Ultraman is that the Ultraman intro is filled with silhouettes of Ultra Q monsters and the opening title begins with the Ultra Q opening before the proper Ultraman one pops on the screen. This is all to setup that Ultraman is a sequel to Ultra Q and it may seem like it wants you to watch Ultra Q first but it almost never referenced Ultra Q. If you want a side tangent on why that is:

remember when I said Ultraseven wasn’t supposed to be cannon to the other shows but was made cannon after the show ended? Something similar happens here. In the Ultra Q episodes they are supposed to take place the year the episodes were released. The show Ultraman however was supposed to take place in the 90’s. This means that basically there is a 30 year gap between the shows so the events of Ultra Q are so old they tend to have no bearing on the show Ultraman. Of course when they made Ultraseven cannon to the other shows they also changed Ultraman’s timeline so that Ultraman the show takes place in the year it came out to make the timeline work. This is a little confusing but basically Ultraman was made with the mindset that Ultra Q happened decades ago and so the events have little effect on Ultraman, however the cannon was changed so that they happened next to eachother. It’s a bit confusing I hope I explained it well enough. If you want a clean look at the cannon basically Return Of Ultraman simply makes it cannon that the show preceding it took place the years they came out and that’s that. Which really cleaned up the timeline and firmly set all of the shows in the same universe without even ruining the logic of the shows. Probably the most important change in the Ultra series’ very long history.

TLDR: You don’t need to see Ultra Q by any means but episode 4 Ultraman lightly references events of Ultra Q episode 20 so if you feel inclined to watch Ultra Q episode 20 first you can do so but it shouldn’t matter too much."
Ultraman,flrszdb,t3_fp4h5a,1585427209.0,"What I’m about to send is all 100% my own opinion and my interpretation of these shows, if I get any details wrong please anybody feel free to correct me the last thing I’d want is to aid misinformation. Well anyways I’m not sure about the Ultraman shows after the 70’s live action ones as much as I’m only just getting into them. However I do have many opinions on the first 7 Ultra shows. Idk if this is helpful but I can give you a rundown of them, again this isn’t me being an elitist to the early shows but I’m simply ignorant about the newer ones except for Geed, most of Orb, a few episodes of Ginga I saw many years ago, and like the first 25 episodes of Tiga. This is just to give info on the older shows since I personally know them and if you liked the Godzilla movies that happen before the 85 one I think you should have no trouble liking these. I’ll just say now that every show listed except for Ultra Q is about some kind of Earth defense force that specializes in fighting monsters and aliens, and one human who has the power to become an Ultra-hero. Whether this character is the Ultra-hero in disguise or has just been given the power to turn into the Ultra-hero varies.

Ultra Q- this is the first series and has no Ultrapeople but it’s basically the Twilight Zone with a heavier focus on creatures, monsters, and aliens. At its best it gets really good but I think it may take a few episodes. It has some real classic monsters and stories though and you may recognize a face or two in the series to follow.

Ultraman- the first one with Ultraman and it’s a pretty lighthearted show with some goofy characters and moments, it can be serious when it wants to however. If you’re concerned about the action I would say the fighting would only get cooler in future shows but this show has so many iconic Ultraman monsters but it can be a turn off compared to other shows that try to be more serious, silly, or outrageous. This one is pretty vanilla Ultraman fare but that’s not an insult it’s a fun show it’s just exactly the middle-ground for all of the shows to follow. Fun but not too zany, serious but never too dramatic, bizarre but not as bizarre as future shows, it doesn’t lean too hard in any direction and instead tries to mix them into one good show. Of course it’s one of the most legendary shows to ever hit Japan and was ground-breaking for what it did, for that reason alone it should be viewed, but if it’s just not doing it for you I strongly recommend this next show.

Ultraseven- my personal favorite, this one can be viewed without watching any other Ultra series as it was created with the intent to not be cannon to any other shows. When Eiji Tsubaraya died and his son took over the company Ultraseven was made cannon to Ultraman after the show had already ended. What that does though is it makes Ultraseven both completely self-contained and also part of the wider Ultra-universe. The reason this one was supposed to be non-cannon to the previous two shows is that it’s really serious and very military. Absolutely not goofy characters are in the main cast and jokes are far and few between. The show focuses on aliens and the Ultra-Squad who tries to squash the alien’s attempts. This show is just a lot of fun and is home to some bizarre and fun aliens.

Return of Ultraman- this show tries to recapture the winning spirit of the first Ultraman show (not Ultra Q) and serves as a spiritual successor with this series having a different Ultraman that at first glance may look identical to the original. This show however really plays the middle ground between Ultraseven and Ultraman as it’s pretty serious and dramatic. I’d say it’s the most character driven show so far and it focuses on the main character’s life outside of monster fighting as well which no other show did before in the Ultra series. Some crazy stuff happens in this show, it starts out pretty tame but serious and gets wackier and weirder as it goes. I think this is a pretty great one but maybe the original series should be viewed first, it’s not necessary though. 

Ultraman Ace- this show is really crazy. It has a man and a woman as our main protagonist as they both combine to form Ultraman Ace. This show is plain creepy at times in a very weird way. This one has a main villain named Yapool who sends super Kaiju to Earth. These super Kaiju are called Choju and are stronger than the average Kaiju. It also means that Choju have a distinct look that’s really bizarre and colorful. This show was pretty weird for all the right reasons and often has some pretty dark or disturbing plots paired with some wacky and crazy looking monsters. This show is fun and has some good lore for the series introduced. This show really starts to set in stone what the lore of Ultras is more than the previous shows.

Ultraman Taro- well remember when I said Ultraman Ace was pretty disturbing at times? Kids across Japan thought so too and so Ultraman Ace lost much of its kids viewer base. Ultraman Taro would be the show to bring that audience of children back to the franchise. Ultraman Taro was veeeeryyy goofy. In my personal opinion, it’s goofy in all of the right ways. It’s outlandish, strange, and tons of fun. Ultraman Taro is an extremely energetic fighter and the monsters are often very fun or silly. I probably have some nostalgia bias for this show personally since it was one of two ultra-shows I watched when I was young (the other being the original Ultraman). There’s not much to say other than expect some wacky monsters and plots and the wackiest Earth defense team yet, ZAT. I haven’t brought up the other shows teams much because they are all pretty normal and do their jobs very well but ZAT is the goofiest team ever, they have huge helmets and ridiculous vehicles and border on incompetence at times. The whole show is charming and this show would expand the lore even further than Ultraman Ace.

Ultraman Leo- well... Ultraman Taro scrambled to win back alienated kids, but in the same stroke, Taro alienated adult viewers. So Ultraman Leo was the show to follow. I don’t know what to say other than I have never seen such a whiplash. As colorful and exciting as Ultraman Taro is, Ultraman Leo is dark and brutal. Ultraseven returns for this series as the captain of the team MAC. After Ultraman Leo’s planet blows up (a different planet than the other Ultras) Ultraman Leo is on a quest to protect his new home, Earth. All I can say is this show is relentless, it’s brutal and dark and extremely violent. You will see people chopped in half and characters in MAC die left and right. It doesn’t help that Ultraseven is the most brutal teacher ever, constantly punishing Leo to train to his limit and hitting him with a cane. As brutal as this may sound this show is incredible, lots of character development here, this show may just be my favorite but I haven’t fully finished it yet so I don’t want to be hasty and put it above Ultraseven just yet. Ultraman Leo is an amazing show in my opinion and I won’t say too much more than that but it’s definitely amazing.

Tokusatsu,flcjpvm,t1_flajlsr,1585033554.0,"Oh sorry for late response, Ultra Q was fully meant and inspired by The Twilight Zone, but since Eiji Tsubaraya was a special effects hero in the field of monster movies, having created and done the special effects for the original Godzilla and many following kaiju hits, the studio asked that Ultra Q have a focus on monsters and kaiju alike. The name Ultra Q means “Ultra Question” and was inspired by a new gymnastic technique in Japan at the time called the Ultra C (I’m not kidding...), this technique had boosted the word Ultra into the Japanese vernacular and it became some somewhat of a buzzword at the time. Tsubaraya used the word Ultra and paired it with the word Q for “Question”. The show Ultra Q is almost an anthology series but it has a set world in which every episode take place together. Sometimes episodes would receive sequels or feature the return of monsters previously seen. The reason it can’t quite be considered an anthology is there are four central characters who appear in nearly episode to varying degrees. Sometimes they are minor character, sometimes the main characters, and sometimes relegated to mere cameos. These characters would switch off their importance every week making there truly be no real main character. The fact that no character is ever guaranteed to even appear in an episode lends the show to succeed at doing whatever it wants to do each week without the plot being pinned down to any “necessary” characters. In this way it really is similar to The Twilight Zone but it has string traces of continuity with, like I said, recurring characters and monsters existing within universe. The monsters and aliens of Ultra Q do appear in, and are referenced in Ultraman. Though in the actual show any appearance and references to them are often subtle, they do make appearances. Ragon notably gets a to be featured as both the main antagonist in an Ultra Q episode and an Ultraman episode. Some appearances vague, a small tiny red monster called Pigmon appears in Ultraman and has an extremely close resemblance to the massive and terrifying Garamon aliens from Ultra Q, however any association between the two unclear. The same thing happens to Ultra Q’s Kemur Man who appears as an illusion in one episode of Ultraman but then appears as Alien Zetton in the finale, though Alien Zetton is supposed to be completely unrelated to the Kemur Man despite looking identical. These are minor details but the most notable and definitive connection of Ultraman and Ultra Q is that the intro to Ultraman begins by being a colorized version of the Ultra Q logo and when the Ultraman intro truly kicks in features an entire host of Ultra Q monsters that never appear in Ultraman at all. Like I was saying earlier however Ultraseven was then intended to follow them up in “the Ultra series” but was not at all meant to be cannon to Ultraman or Ultra Q. It’s clear when you watch the show, it shares no references to Ultraman vague or otherwise whereas Ultraman proudly homaged Ultra Q right in the intro by featuring its creatures original opening. Likewise the character of Ultraseven shares similarities to Ultraman but is missing crucial features such as the color timer which gives Ultraman a time limit. Ultraseven’s powers and design vary from Ultraman’s greatly in some cases as the show established itself different from Ultraman but truly carrying its own identity. Like I said earlier the reason for this is likely that Ultraseven was intended for adults and Ultraman was intended for families. Ultra Q plays a little more inbetween these two, it’s often very serious but it is definitely home to its goofy and lighthearted episodes that feature extremely silly moments. The best example of this would be episode 6 “Grow Up! Little Turtle”. While Ultra Q did feature some lighthearted episodes it does have some gravely serious ones as well, and so does Ultraman. However with the installment of Ultraman coming out and being very family friendly and often straight up humorous it would not make sense for Ultraseven to find itself being cannon to that show. One example in Ultraman is the time the Science Patrol (a monster attack force that our main character belongs to) had to take down a monster that was a two dimensional drawing at night and became a three dimensional giant monster during the day, the Science Patrol decided against simply erasing the drawing during the night because it wouldn’t be a “fair fight” and would hurt their pride. Ultraseven as a TV show would never have its central characters handle situations like this. Ultraseven’s central characters often are forced to experience the terrible regret and drama that would ensue if a real monster or alien threatened life on Earth. The main crew in Ultraseven would never pass on an opportunity to save lives for pride like the Science Patrol did. I know I covered a lot more than you asked but once I got going into Ultra Q I felt there was a bit more to say once I learned you were making a video that would reference these shows. Well anyways I wanna say thanks so much for the award! Feel free to use any information I gave you and I hope your video turns out great! Link it to me when you’ve finished. Have a great day!!"
Tokusatsu,flaidzm,t1_fk2fxh1,1584984485.0,"One thing of note is that at the time Ultraseven was not at all cannon to the Ultra shows that were before it. Ultra Q was basically a Japanese Twilight Zone but with monsters and Ultraman followed it up even directly featuring the Ultra Q intro in each episode before the actual Ultraman intro flies on to the screen. Both Ultraman and Ultra Q were known to have somewhat quirky and fun characters and episodes from time to time. Many characters in Ultraman are very unrealistically goofy or silly for belonging to a special government operation. So when Eiji Tsubaraya made his final Ultra show it was to be expressly made with adults in mind. When setting forth to write Ultraseven he most likely felt that Ultraman was too campy and too family friendly to make sense in the universe of Ultraseven. Ultraseven was very military in approach with our main character constantly having to suffer through moral dilemma after moral dilemma. Campiness is extremely minimal in Ultraseven and the tone is deadly serious. So because of all of this Ultraseven was a completely separate cannon from Ultraman and Ultra Q. However this would change when Eiji’s son would take the mantel and create Return Of Ultraman. Return would definitively host appearances of Ultraseven and Ultraman firmly establishing them in the same cannon. Personally I prefer to watch Ultraseven as a series by itself, it’s very different from the shows it’s surrounded by and it’s Eiji Tsubaraya’s swan song show and imo his absolute best. Ultraseven is perhaps my favorite show period. However I do love Return Of Ultraman and many shows after including the most recent one I’ve seen, Ultraman Geed. What I like about this is Ultraseven can truly be taken as it’s own series outside of any others and it can also be taken as cannon to the others so the character can return. I like both realities. And if you’re so inclined, in the 90’s they continued the Ultraseven character with another show of his own featuring a returning cast, this show is set in the continuity of Ultraseven alone, ignoring all other Ultra shows just as the original had intended to. Ultraseven is the only Ultra show to feature a treatment like this and it’s easy to see why with how amazing it is. Sorry for the huge spiel but I thought this was worth a mention since yes it sort of is a reboot but it’s also a sequel series in the cannon depending on the context you take it."

This is the only album I skip tracks on and those last three are the ones. When I hear Wouldn’t It Be Nice I want the rest of Pet Sounds to follow it. Anyways with that out of the way.... I have a decent amount of fun with this album. It’s definitely dated but I like the title track a lot and the Brian tune is fun. Island Girl is a fun song and Kokomo has that beautiful Carl vocal. Wipeout is uhhh.... ya know it is what it is. It’s kind of fun. Make It Big has another excellent Carl vocal and he sings lead on this one so it’s great. Honestly Carl during these last years of his life sounded better than ever I cannot get enough of Carl from this era. He’s the most major reason I listen to anything off of Summer In Paradise. I’m not sure if this is a hot take but Carl’s voice during this era may be my favorite, it might also just be that the songs during this era aren’t the best so when I hear Carl it’s a god send. Lol well anyways those are just my thoughts on the album, nothing too factual just my own opinions.

I’m not gonna give my opinion on everything that’s going on because that’s not the point. I just think this is relatively big news for the boys and it’s only natural it be discussed. Eventually it will blow over and become a footnote so I wouldn’t try to force the conversation about it to end. It seems the whole dispute has ran its course anyways. This does greatly damage speculation of a 2022 reunion though."

arresteddevelopment,ffvtu45,t1_ffv426w,1580273079.0,"Sorry for late response, yea it was redone because each episode in the original cut focused on one character rather than all of them. The redone cut changed that to give the illusion of them all being together but what it actually ends up doing is giving episodes no story structure. There’s no proper first, second, and third acts. It’s just a compilation of clips from different episodes sandwiched together. The worst part is they cut out some jokes straight and most horrible of all, they show the clips with no regard with how they were supposed to be set up. Basically in the original cut you will see a scene, it’ll probably be a fine scene, let’s pretend this scene is from a Tobias episode, the Gob episode will come around and a scene that happened in Tobias’ episode will be completely recontextualized by a scene in the Gob episode. Every episode either has a scene that will be redefined, or does redefine a scene in itself. The Remix cut avoids this by showing every scene in chronological order, so basically all of these scenes that gain context later are given all of the context before you view it. This means two things. The first is that the scenes just have too much context and are too difficult to both follow logically and enjoy. And the second thing this means is that Ron Howard has to step in and narrate eeextra hard, now Ron will spend up to ten minutes at a time narrating stuff just so the Remix cut can make sense showing the scenes out of the intended order. As for the original cut it’s really incredible how they wrote it. For some people I see why it’s not as funny, it’s veeeeery different and some dynamics feel gone. But the reveals themselves are far too clever and amazing for me to dismiss this season as worse than the first three. I recommend it. I first watched the Remix cut myself not knowing there’s an original cut and I left the season very mixed, I really didn’t enjoy it, some episodes were just pain. Recently I went back and rewatched the season as originally intended and I absolutely loved it, I felt so depressed all of the amazing reveals were spoiled for me in the Remix cut unceremoniously. The original cut shows these reveals like bombshells that really matter, the Remix cut shows the reveals before they even matter. 

TLDR: the Remix cut took away almost everything about the original cut that makes it special"
arresteddevelopment,ffuyo7i,t3_evd17d,1580251867.0,"Oh definitely make sure you’re not watching season 4 remix: fateful consequences, season 4 is divisive but most people agree the fateful consequences remix is way worse than the original cut, which I personally love. For the season 4 original cut go to trailers and more and see how season 4 was originally presented."

ShinyPokemon,feg0ulx,t1_feg0ctd,1579072135.0,"Oh wow that’s very cool that you have the Eon Ticket I definitely wanna get one at some point, I should have gotten them a few years back because they were slightly cheaper and now I’m regretting it. I also have the Jirachi bonus disc and hunting for the shiny Jirachi is actually really really tempting to me but I know it’s an excruciating hunt. But I also bought a Ranger copy with a Manaphy egg and I can’t just hatch it without attempting to get it shiny first, so maybe the Jirachi hunt would be a good way to build my patience. Anyways I’ve only done this one full odds hunt ever so I’m getting very ahead of myself. Btw out of curiosity have you used the Eon Ticket to hunt Latios/Latias?"
ShinyPokemon,fefxy56,t1_feeylit,1579068937.0,"Oh yea I don’t know about any completely legitimate Mystic Ticket Distributions, if I did I sure as heck wouldn’t be able to resist. The Aurora listing is still on eBay though if you likewise are interested. Also thanks so much for the offers! I actually saw the seller who makes the custom Mystic Ticket event and it is very cool and honestly a super neat idea. I think personally I may hold off on it for now as I do wanna play through Colosseum and XD anyways since I own them and stuff. It is a bit of a slog getting through Colosseum currently though as the animations, while gorgeous and packing more character than the modern main series Pokémon animations, are super slow and there’s absolutely no way to turn them off. But yea thanks again for the offers and I can direct you to an Eon Ticket service or the Aurora ticket service I used if you want!"
ShinyPokemon,fee99kq,t1_fee4b9z,1579029034.0,"Wow that’s very neat! Thanks for the encouragement, when I finally complete my gen 3 living Dex I think I’ll shift over to shiny hunting a lot more, this happened to be a unique case as it was easiest to shiny hunt the Deoxys before actually catching a normal one for the living Dex because I could double encounter. The most difficult part of this is playing Colosseum and XD just to get Ho-oh and Lugia. Again though thanks for the kind words it’s always nice to talk about this because my friends just aren’t into Pokémon."

ShinyPokemon,fecybyc,t1_fecwt3w,1578989662.0,"Thanks so much! This guy on eBay supposedly had a legit event cart to transfer the Deoxys’ on to games, basically I couldn’t resist as I’m trying to complete third gen as legit as possible (and anyways if it wasn’t a legit cart and he was lying at the very least he was using the actual data that was put online from a legit cart) and I bought a Leafgreen with the aurora ticket on it and also sent in my copy of Firered to get an aurora ticket on that copy too. I really only needed it to complete living Dex I’m working on but I decided to get two so I could shiny hunt it. This was many months in the making because during my first semester of college I was overloaded with work and could only now get back to it over break. I’m so relieved to finally have it and I can continue on my living Dex quest. Sorry for long response lol."
