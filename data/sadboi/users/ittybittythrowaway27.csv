I think you really do have to experience gender dysphoria to ""get"" it- the same way a white person doesn't understand how it feels to be black, or a straight person doesn't understand how it feels to be gay.

It's honestly an unrealistic standard to expect you to know what trans people think and feel and definitely doesn't make you shitty. As long as we have your support, we're happy.:D"

Have you had caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, soda)? A lot of it? That'll make your heart go wild for sure. Headaches from insomnia are pretty common.

But you'll definitely wake up when you go to bed. There's no reason to worry. Something I do when I get anxious like this is turn off all lights, turn my fan on as high as it can go, and cacoon myself in blankets. Sometimes I listen to asmr/music but another secretly calming category of videos are tutorial vids (cooking, sewing etc).

Obviously there are still disgusting and hateful parts of the USA, specifically in the south, but I would say the general attitude is better.

NoStupidQuestions,fo2l7oy,t3_g5cxaj,1587466592.0,"4+3+1+2= 10 skittles.

Let's list the probability for each.
P(yellow) = 4/10 or 2/5
P(red)= 3/10
P(purple)= 1/10
P(orange)= 2/10 or 1/5

If you are NOT eating each skittle you pick, then you simply have to multiply the above probability twice.

For example, let's find out the probability of getting two yellow skittles in a row. The problem would look like this-

2/5 x 2/5 = 4/25. There is a 4 out of 25 chance that you'll get two yellows in a row!

If you ARE eating each skittle you pick, it's not very different. Just remember that the probability will change. You pull out one yellow skittle (4/10 chance) and then eat it. That means there will now only be THREE yellow skittles left, and NINE skittles total. The new P(yellow) is 3/9.

Use the same formula as before once you have the new probability.

4/10 x 3/9 = 12/90 or 2/15. 

I hope this helps!!
