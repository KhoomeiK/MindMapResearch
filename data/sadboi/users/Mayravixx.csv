AskReddit,fpyct65,t3_gfsi0q,1589001475.0,"This just happened today but essentially, I've been told several times that our house is haunted. I had stopped believing in it until something invisible somehow terrified our cat to the point where his tail was severely puffed up, back was arched, and he was growling and hissing for about an hour straight, looking in a direction where no one was. There were no sounds that could've spooked him, but both of our dogs have reacted in similar ways several times, one of which was terrified to the point of shaking the first time it happened. And before anyone says it could be our central air unit, the one connected to the entire house hasn't been connected to a power source in years so it is non-functional so we all just use fans or an actual AC that plugs into the wall and sits in the window. In this same house, I've also woken up in an absolute panic several times for no reason, no bad dreams and I don't suffer from sleep paralysis at all and the panic state generally lasts for about an hour, whereas if it was just a bad dream, I'd recover in maybe a minute tops. Our electronics are also seemingly tampered with, for example, a clock I had that connected to old iPhones and iPods, would randomly shut off, skip songs, or pause on its own.

Really spooky stuff and I honestly, to this day despite looking at possible reasons, have never found a logical answer to all of it."

 In the last days of high summer, with lightning striking blue in a black sky, the sorcerer stood on a high cliff overlooking the raging sea‚Ä¶¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  


Belting out his grief into the storm, Hoyt Mac Cionaoith rails against the evil that has torn his twin brother from their family‚Äôs embrace. Her name is Lilith. Existing for over a thousand years, she has lured countless men to an immortal doom with her soul-stealing kiss. But now, this woman known as vampire will stop at nothing until she rules this world‚Äîand those beyond it‚Ä¶  


Hoyt is no match for the dark siren. But his powers come from the goddess Morrigan, and it is through her that he will get his chance at vengeance. At Morrigan‚Äôs charge, he must gather five others to form a ring of power strong enough to overcome Lilith. A circle of six: himself, the witch, the warrior, the scholar, the one of many forms, and the one he‚Äôs lost. And it is in this circle, hundreds of years in the future, where Hoyt will learn how strong his spirit‚Äîand his heart‚Äîhave become‚Ä¶"

AskReddit,foke3t0,t3_g7vxme,1587840369.0,"Desktop person here, me personally, I prefer Linux simply due to the open-source nature of it, not to mention I'd never have to worry about some billion dollar company introducing a version of Windows that's basically spyware. I get most online sites sell your data, while I personally don't like it, it's to be expected, but I don't like how forceful Microsoft is about it. I literally have to keep running Windows 10 debloater every time it updates to get rid of telemetry. And then there's also the issue of RAM. On Linux, by default it might take up MAYBE 400 - 700 MB of my RAM by default. Windows? ""Mmm, yes, I'll take half of your ram for no reason and spend it on processes you don't want open and can't close, k thanks.""

The best part is if you have two graphics cards, you can use your more powerful one for a gaming virtual machine and run Windows games there, and the lesser one for the Linux system. Even if I didn't use a VM, I could always use Lutris to play my Windows games with Vulkan and get the same performance I'd get on a Windows PC. Steam even has their own fork of Wine that's more or less optimized for gaming, so gaming on Linux is no longer an issue to me. Another reason is program size. Quite a few programs for Windows tend to be several hundred MB in size, or even GB in size. Normally that's not an issue, but when most of the programs I need on Linux are only around a few kb to MAYBE 50 MB, that's a hell of a lot better and really saves hard disk space since all I have are some 500GB drives."
