bipolar,fr1ehzb,t3_glxd8u,1589818311.0,"Try the 90/10 rule. The key is to give your creative ideas some breathing room with a small and controlled testing ground without doing anything dramatic which could harm you.  


Give them a testing ground of 10% of your time and effort and see what the result is. Spend 90% of your time and effort on maintaining the good things you currently have. Starting an Etsy store may be great, just bracket 10% of your time to try it out and then if it is going well and is sustainable then up it to 15 or 20% after a few months.  


This allows you to enjoy these creative ideas and work on something interesting while also knowing you are doing this in a controlled, sustainable way. Tell your friends and family about the 90/10 rules and they can support you in this. Quitting your job will only make life much more stressful but a 90/10 approach will allow you to move in a positive direction and will give you hope for a better future. :)"

I have had this kind of thing along with panic attacks before and had MRI, ECG tests, blood tests and everything else and have always been fine. The great news is that at your age stress is by far the most likely cause over literally everything else.   


Keeping in mind that I'm not a doctor I would say that you are way too young to be in any serious risk of the things that worry you. It's extremely unlikely that you have any serious condition as an otherwise healthy 18 year old. The fact that your symptoms come and go with anxiety further points to this being the real problem.  


Having said this it's always good to get a check-up as it helps put your mind to rest. Calling a doctor on the phone can be really reassuring, they will ask you plenty of questions to try and rule out certain things and it can really help.

I do keep a good regimen with brushing my teeth because that‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve always done and it makes me feel decent; especially before going to sleep at night.

I know the feeling man, hot showers also helped me at times. Here's what I learned: 15-20 minutes of running on the spot (usually while listening to a podcast) gives around 20%-40% relief from this feeling. Latest science research is showing that Bipolar is to some extent related to mitochondrial metabolism in the brain and moderate (aerobic) cardio temporarily changes the body's metabolism and burns off certain detrimental things (excess glucose, lactate etc.)  Also, see my other reply in this thread."

Felt like life was like running in a marathon except I was the only one with an invisible 200 pound backpack. The most basic things would exhaust me. Every day I would long to get to bed, just hauling myself through the day until I could finally collapse into bed and sit on my laptop or read (often whilst drinking). I spent most of my life like this. About 5 years ago I began reading everything I could find on Bipolar research to understand why I had no energy.

The latest scientific evidence is showing that Bipolar is caused -to some degree- by dysfunction of mitochondria in the brain (the energy making component of cells). Improving mitochondrial function by altering various aspects of metabolism is something I spent the last 5 years working on. I am now 80+% well, with a good job and studying a PhD part time. I have written about my recovery here on my blog: www.ketobipolar.com. I hope this may help you overcome this exhaustion too.

Wishing you renewed energy my friend.

P.S. I am not a doctor and it should go without saying that this is just my personal experience and is based only on my own understanding of Bipolar which could be completely wrong.

If you do remain together focus only on what you can control. 20 mins light cardio will reduce the noise in his head and help you see the real person behind it.

1. 15-20 mins light- moderate exercise have me around 20% relief when it felt like my head was in a vice of pain. It burns off various things that accumulate in the body of those with BD (mostly excess glucose).

2. Research is gradually showing that the bipolar brain doesn‚Äôt process glucose well and this is gradually becoming a leading  theory for what bipolar is. This also means you can potentially do something about it. Personally I reduce glucose and try to generate ‚Äúketones‚Äù for energy for the brain instead by doing a Ketogenic Diet. It has basically almost completely reversed my bipolar. Google it, many others with similar testimonials. 

3. Books of Stoic philosophy (start with Ryan Holiday The Obstacle is the Way ) are designed to give you methods for coping with extreme and difficult circumstances. Many of the greatest people in history studies their works to learn how to deal with great adversity. This helped me immensely.

Think of it like a powerful medicine available to you at any time. 

Researchers are very gradually beginning to discover through multiple lines of evidence that Bipolar is fundamentally a problem with the brains ability to use glucose effectively. The best thing that can be done for this is to exercise every day and reduce sugar/refined carb intake.  Both of these things stop the brain becoming overburdened with excessively high glucose levels by burning off excess and limiting intake. I was extremely unwell for 20+ years before I discovered this and I‚Äôm now 80-90% recovered with very few episodes following low carb high healthy fat ketogenic diet with 30mins running each day.

selfhelp,fm2uspn,t3_fsleyj,1585705906.0,"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this, life does get better, I promise. I felt exactly the same as you when I was 17. All my problems felt completely overwhelming and I would often feel physically sick thinking that there was no escape, I couldn‚Äôt see any hope and yet I always held onto the tiniest bit of faith that things could make sense again and be ok. I know you have that same little bit of faith in you, believe in it, trust it and fan the flame. It might be a small flicker at times but it is forever and it will never go out.

You will find some really good people in the world, people who really care about you and accept you for who are without any judgement, there really are such people out there (I didn‚Äôt think there was and then I ended up marrying one!). You will move on to a different stage of life entirely and leave many of these problems behind. I know it‚Äôs hard to imagine but in 5-10 years you won‚Äôt be worried about any of the things that are currently weighing on you. You‚Äôll likely get to travel and see incredible things. The world is a wonderful place even with Bipolar and you will gradually realise there is more beauty and wonder out there than you could possibly have expected or imagined. Life unfolds gradually and there is more out there for you than you can currently see if you can have just enough faith to believe it in this dark time.

As someone who sounds a lot like me when I was younger I want you to know that I‚Äôm proud of you and your ability to fight through this. I know people don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre going through but your internal struggle matters and is important for reasons you will understand one day. For now you just need to keep going, one day at a time. I‚Äôm passing on 2 gifts that have helped me along the same road:


Researchers are gradually understanding that Bipolar is a ‚Äòmetabolic condition‚Äô which means it is a disruption of the bodies normal ability to make energy. There are 2 major ways to help with this in addition to medication:

15-20 mins of light-moderate running will give you relief when the depression/anxiety is really bad. Think of it as a powerful medicine. It can help reset your bodies energy in a way through beneficial effects on your energy making cells (mitochondria).

Avoid sugar which is not a sustainable fuel source for the brain and will make you more unstable. Instead eat whole, natural foods with healthy fats and watch how your mood improves."
Anxiety,fm2osj3,t3_fsndk9,1585701995.0,"I've felt this kind of fear too having siblings who work in hospitals but I'm managing it much better this past week. This is a great opportunity to become skillful in dealing with fear. The greatest book ever written in my opinion on this is: ""How to Stop Worrying and Start Living Your Life"" by Dale Carnegie, I promise it will really help you through this. I found these things helpful:  


1. Absolutely limit your news and internet reading to 10 minutes per day looking at responsible websites who aren't trying to alarm you. You will fell 50% better from this alone. Avoid stories which report on singular incidents which tend to be highly unusual and focus on the big data which gives a more accurate picture of what is going on for the country in general.
2. Read positive stories to balance out your viewpoint, cases are now reducing in China, South Korea and Italy and soon enough they will be in the U.S also. It may take 2-3 months but it will pass. 
3. Consider that around 60,000 people a year in the US die of the flu and you do not feel this same level of fear. Have a think about why this is, how the media plays into this. Coronavirus is absolutely something to take very seriously and follow government advice but the fear doesn't necessarily need to be at the level you are describing. 
4. Manage your fear by taking one day at a time. Stop thinking way out into the future and what-ifs just get absorbed in either work or fundraising activities from home during the day. Spend most of the day absorbed in something meaningful which helps people or builds new skills and you'll feel much better.

Get your heart-rate up but not too much, you should still be able to speak comfortably. This is going to take the edge off the anxiety and unstable mood for you, you‚Äôll see. 

Then I want you to take a week off of sugar. This is going to further take the edge off and give you some stability. 

Researchers are very gradually coming to understand that Bipolar is a problem with the brains ability to burn glucose. Both exercise and getting off sugar are major ways to lower blood glucose levels to normal range which helps to stabilise mood. Feel free to message me if you want more info or if I can help.

I've been through this also, exactly as you describe. Feeling like everything is unreal and  I don't exist, afraid to sleep, having terrifying existential thoughts, panic attacks. It felt like I was dangling on a single spider thread above a bottomless pit many days. I had every medical test under the sun due to severe physical symptoms (nothing was wrong with me physically).  


This is very common for those with anxiety and will gradually get better for you. The turning point for me was reading ""Dare"" by Barry McDonagh. He had all the feelings you describe and lays out a truly effective method for dealing with them, it helped me immensely: [https://dareresponse.com/](https://dareresponse.com/)

  
If you practice the method in this book you will slowly start to feel better and one day you will wake up and realize you feel normal again, but a better, stronger normal.

Our illness is very very gradually being understood by researchers and the main advancement in the last 10 years is the realisation that people with Bipolar generally can‚Äôt process glucose well in their brain. 

You have 2 lines of defence against this:

1. Burning off glucose in your muscles by exercising ( 20-30 mins light-moderate cardio)

2. Reducing and then cutting out out sugar and refined carbs from your diet and replacing with healthy fat sources. Many do a Ketogenic Diet as used In Epilepsy https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6620566/

Combining this with intermittent fasting and daily moderate intensity exercise (jogging for 20 mins) I feel 80-90% well.

Imagine having 100 pounds of hot chains wrapped around you wherever you go, that is what it feels like. I know this because I have a wife who cared for me when I was in this state and couldn‚Äôt work. She cared for me until I recovered and I will never have such a close bond with anyone because of this. As soon as I had the energy I began taking care of her and helping her fulfil her dreams but I remember months of pain knowing I was letting her down and I couldn‚Äôt get it together. I had to fix my biology and get more energy first. I truly admire and respect your dedication to him, things can get better I promise.

You cant make him a better man, but you can help him remove these chains so that he can have a chance at it. The doctor will look after his medications so that means you have 2 main areas where you can help him to improve: Diet and Exercise. You will not believe the difference this can make. He will then be able to help himself more. Research is showing Bipolar people have great trouble processing sugar in their brain. Read about this when you can. This means burning it off in the muscles with exercise and reducing consumption of sugar is the first step to having more energy. 

Light cardio daily and cutting out all sugar/refined carbs and replacing them with liberal amounts of healthy fat is step 1. He will feel 15-20% better, put all your effort into achieving only this. It will give him some strength to be the person he wants to be for you. He probably loves you more than he can possibly express in his current state, help him get those chains off. 

Next, read up on no-sugar, no carb ketogenic diet and read the testimonials from those with Bipolar. Consult with his doctor so he has support if trying this.

There are many studies showing that lactate build-up happens in Bipolar almost like a runner whose body is reaching it‚Äôs limit and becoming exhausted.

There are 2 things I do to counteract this which have helped me immensely:

1. Reducing glucose and carbohydrate intake and increasing healthy fat consumption (strict Ketogenic Diet as used in epilepsy therapy). 
2. Moderate intensity exercise for at least 20 minutes a day.

4. You‚Äôd be surprised how many people go through this. I would estimate that at least 5-10 people you know have experienced this but don‚Äôt talk about it, it‚Äôs way more common than you think.

5. Exercise really helped me as did cutting out sugar and refined carbs. 

6. It can feel like it will never get better. But don‚Äôt believe those irrational thoughts, nothing lasts and you will gain balance again, the Dare book will help you with the journey.

7. You will come out of this stronger than you ever could have been had you not gone through it. You are teaching  yourself to overcome fear itself and that is a thing you should be proud of. 

Hang in there, you‚Äôve got many great times ahead. Many thousands of us around the world are going through this too and you‚Äôre not alone. Keep chatting to us on here . The weird feeling might be around for a few weeks but eventually it will start to fade if you use the techniques in the Dare book. It took me a year to get over the worst of it but that‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt have the right info initially. It gradually just faded away. I occasionally have small attacks of it but never as bad as before. You will be OK my friend. I had it as bad as I can imagine anyone having it and I have slowly recovered over the last year to near-normality. Please get yourself the Dare book, the technique it describes is incredibly helpful."
bipolar,filugxs,t3_f8jxen,1582510628.0,"I recognise the pain my friend. Sending you love and good thoughts. When I was going through something similar I found mindfulness meditation to be incredibly helpful, also running even for 10 minutes always gave me a lot of relief. We all go through heartbreak and it‚Äôs painful but I truly believe there‚Äôs a reason for these things. Use this as an opportunity to learn new things about yourself and about the strengths you have."
bipolar,fic66wn,t1_fic3vig,1582338608.0,"I have felt this many times too, sending love, understanding and hugs to you, you are not alone in this and I believe you will recover."
PanicAttack,fi9q9of,t1_fi90war,1582276963.0,You are an awesome human.
PanicAttack,fi91llb,t3_f73qk4,1582253398.0,"So the anticonvulsants (Bipolar meds) you take are the same ones they use in epilepsy. The other most effective treatment for epilepsy is Ketogenic Diet (nearly a century of clinical use and trials showing it to reduce seizures).

The ketogenic diet has quite profound effects on the brain and there‚Äôs increasing indications it can help with psychiatric conditions. Chris Palmers MD has a good website about this. Just something you may be interested to read more about.

Rooting for you to recover from this my friend, take it easy on yourself and be kind to yourself, life is a hard journey and I thing you‚Äôre doing remarkably well considering. üòä"
PanicAttack,fi5w34j,t3_f6l17h,1582171894.0,"Yes, I have exactly the same fears. You‚Äôre not alone in this and these are questions every person comes to think about in time. Take comfort in knowing that we‚Äôre all in this thing together and we all face these common worries and concerns, it lightens the burden to know this. 

Maybe the most difficult thing is fear itself. Marcus Aurelius said ‚Äúwe suffer much more in our imagination than we do in reality‚Äù. His book meditations you might find very helpful. He was a Roman emperors who wrestled with existential questions just like you but was living hundreds of years ago.

I also find this quote from Frank Herbert helpful: 

‚ÄúI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.‚Äù

Thanks for sharing with us all, I hope you can find peace my friend."
BipolarReddit,fi2xlke,t3_f60lvm,1582092404.0,"Hey, thanks for sharing this.üòäCan I ask, are you still in touch with a psychiatrist or counsellor? Keep talking to us on here in any case, you‚Äôve got plenty of friends in similar situations."
Anxiety,fi2x1co,t1_fi2io3m,1582091841.0,"Yes, the reduction of anxiety can be quite incredible with consistent practice. If I consistently meditate within 2 weeks my anxiety is 50-80% relieved. It‚Äôs the difference between struggling to tread water in a raging river of anxious thought and sitting on the bank of that river watching it go by calmly. Headspace app is a good place to start or the Jon Kabat Zinn book on mindfulness, Let know if you need more info, wishing you peace and calmness."

Anxiety,fi2iiie,t3_f63qwc,1582080556.0,"I‚Äôve been through similar feelings and I‚Äôm sorry you are suffering, what helped me was:

Step 1: Read ‚ÄúHow to Stop Worrying and Start Living Your Life‚Äù it has changed many people‚Äôs lives. 

Step 2: Start a mindfulness meditation practice.

Step 3: Exercise every day."
