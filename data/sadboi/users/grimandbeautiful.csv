AskReddit,f8sxnk6,t3_e20v12,1574791367.0,My brother molested me. He whines about not being forgiven by me but I find it discusting he cares so much about forgiveness. If I was him the last thing I would expect is forgiveness. I would feel like a discusting monster and I would actually isolate myself from my family if I was that twisted. He needs to go to therapy far away from me and my little sister. Why my parents let him around my sister is beyond me. It’s his birthday today and my mom wants me to come up with 5 awesome things about him... I legitimately only have underhanded compliments.

costa_rica,erh4tzt,t1_erg9ecz,1560867192.0,Costa Rica isn’t known for their food. Most tourist destinations will have different types of food(like sushi and pizza) I personally love Gallo Pinto <3
costa_rica,erh4bc4,t3_c1htpp,1560866812.0,Yes just walk around the north east side early :) most cool places get filled up quickly. There’s hostels with yoga classes and gardening or at night clubs and many cheap ones too. I don’t know about any hotels.
