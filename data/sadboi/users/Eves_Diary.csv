bipolar,fgwyds3,t3_f0pdk0,1581167237.0,"My mother is bipolar, her mania manifest basically with screaming and compulsive cleaning behavior. Her depressive episodes are the worst memories of my childhood. I came to terms with it rather quickly.

She refuses treatment, which doesn't make it any better. I'm 19 now about to move abroad and she's still as stubborn as ever. My father doesn't do much to change that.

My family has history with psychotic episodes and I wouldn't be surprised if my mother has one, anytime in the future.

As someone who has finally reached a ""stable"" state thanks to therapy, meds and changing my coping behavior I'm just... disappointed, you know? I'm not even mad or sad or afraid of her anymore. She's going to destruct herself, flipping me off everytime I bring up therapy or meds, I just gave up on her.

She probably inherited bipolar disorder from her mother too. But that woman is undiagnosed and untreated and the fucking worse to interact with. I cut relationships with her because of that, and I already see myself doing the same with my mother. Such a pity, really."

bipolar,fb7hgns,t1_fb7fuig,1576590152.0,I stop what I'm doing and stare blankly at the nearest window I find. It terrifies me the idea of one day I'll dissociate so hard that I'll actually jump. But when the idea comes to mind I became alert again. I guess it's the fear that wakes me up?
bipolar,fb7h6ep,t3_ebseyq,1576589900.0,"Yes, I dissociate a lot. Almost an everyday thing and it is terrifying. With it I've had a lot of issues recognizing myself when I look at the mirror because before my diagnosis I really believed that I wasn't living my life but just looking over someone else's. Really strange shit but dunno if it's because bipolar disorder or panic disorder. Maybe both.

My way of coping with it it's not the best. It usually comes when I'm feeling a lot of emotions at once (like turning a switch) or when I'm severely depressed. As someone with Bipolar type II and panic disorder both of those things come often if not simultaneously. But when it's the second one it's even more terrifying if possible. Cuz I feel like someone is ripping apart my body and consciousness and taking me away. Because of it I started self-harming. Before it was cuts but when I didn't have anything to cut myself with I started scratching. Hard. The back of my neck and my arms suffer a lot but at least it doesn't leave scares as ""permanent"" as cutting. I'm working with my therapist to stop it though."

Dunno if it helps, hang on there bud!"

But seeing how many people have positive reviews on them... I may ask my psychiatrist if I should go back on them on my next appointment. Wish me luck!

bipolar,f6jsolz,t3_drfyuc,1572899630.0,Yeah. I was diagnosed not long ago and the mood stabilizers my doctor prescribed me made me very conscious about it. I would burst on giddiness and start laughing to myself out of nothing or snap at anything. The meds stopped working and I had to go off them and now the giddiness and anger came back strong as ever. I'm still very new at this and thought it was normal for non-bipolar people but apparently it's not. The more you know

Apparently you were right, Lamictal didn't work for me. I told my psychiatrist what happened and I suspended them, I had 2 sudden mood swings that may have been triggered by Lamictal. I was on Lamictal for a week and a half with a bunch of side effects and they worked quite well until yesterday, it was really bad ngl."
