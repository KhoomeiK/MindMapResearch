HomeImprovement,fqwy7d2,t3_gl3v57,1589721098.0,"Look for access to the room topside first, before demolition.

Our family had a large farmhouse, built around 1890.  The original foundations were stone.

There was a cellar to the home about 12'x12'.  It had been left in it's original state.  It had the two door access from the outside.

But... One summer, it was decided to remodel the kitchen, and check the floor for any rotted wood or weaknesses.

There was a specific ""squeak"" under one part of the floor. (Covered with linoleum by previous owner.)

The guys pulled back the linoleum, to find a small square of wood, which when opened, went directly into the cellar.

We never noticed that panel access from underneath, because newer wood, lined parts of the ceiling in the cellar, along with a wooden post that stood ground to ceiling. (A reinforcement?)

All this to say, check for other possible access points.  These older homes have had different ownership through the years, and self home maintenance can sometimes cover up original stuff.

Good luck!"

My Aunt and I were doing some work around her house.  I heard a very familiar whistle coming from the basement stairs, so I made my way to the basement porch area, thinking it was her whistling to get my attention.

To my surprise, we met at the porch landing and asked each other at the same time, ""Did you need something? I heard the wistle.""

We just stared at each other for a bit.  For some reason, we both looked up toward the kitchen, then back to each other.

We knew that whistle.

We both walked out the porch door and lit a cigarette.  Still not saying anything, we nodded our head in a silent acknowledgement of what just happened.

That house, my Grandparents built.  They had passed over 20 years ago.

We always had that feeling they were ""there"", in the sense that their memory was there.  Unexplaind things had happened before, but I chalked it up to something else.

illnessfakersgonewild,fnwo24o,t1_fnvw1i1,1587322082.0,"The thing is, they can release you to a transition type home (through the psyche unit's County Social worker).

I found myself in a really scary one.  What the house was supposed to support you with, they don't.  It's was an obvious insurance money grab from the property owner, to list his rental as one.

It was so bad, we drove back to the hospital and reported this ""transition house"".

It's not that they are *all* without shelter, it's just that some of these after care places are scary as hell.

I ""noped"" right out of there.  Luckily, my BF works in Rochester, so I called him.  He was shocked I was placed in that neighborhood.  When he has to work in that area, he CCs.  

I saw at least 4 drug deals while waiting for him to arrive.

There are homeless there, yes.  Southern MN is rural/farm country.  I know of one homeless shelter in Mankato, but it's men only.  Mankato is at least a 2hr drive from Rochester.

At least I had a home to go back to.  Rochester is only a half hour drive for me.

If this gal truly is at St.Mary's Generose, doing the outpatient program, and can't afford a hotel.  There's a good chance she could end up in a seedy ""care home"".  If she doesn't have any insurance, no idea where she could possibly end up."

When I was there, they take your phone when you check in."
