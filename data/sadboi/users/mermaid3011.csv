badroommates,fiino4w,t1_fihzdru,1582423650.0,"So just to confirm: you BOTH signed the lease? And it ends in May and you want to stay and she wants to leave?

I suggest you find a legal aid office to understand exactly what to do when the lease is up and turns into a month to month lease.

WHY?
If she wants to leave, but you want to stay you BOTH have to negotiate with the landlord. I.e. you both have to give notice to end the existing lease, then you need to be approved by the landlord as new tenant by yourself.

REPORT THEFT?
I would give her a couple days to return the cushion and then report vandalism/theft.
It MAY help you in the long run. It may just make things a bit more difficult... your call. 

GETTING OUT NOW?
Looks like domestic violence would be a stretch, unless she is actually throwing things AT you... and it wouldn’t guarantee that she would be kicked out. Even if you could claim domestic violence, it would only give you the option of ending the lease but she would still be there..."

If you only have a verbal agreement, does that mean you are the tenant and your roommate only rents a spare room from you?

Depending on where you are (again: state?province?) a tenant may have different notice periods opposed to a roommate.

Example:
Ontario requires 60 day notice to evict a tenant, but only 2-4 weeks for a roommate with no specific agreement.

So, once you give notice, be prepared that your roommate moves out quicker than you planned (before the 60 days are up) and in return gives you only 1-2 weeks or even no notice. Unless he put down a deposit you may be out of his next month’s rent."

In general: drug use is an illegal act that infringes on the enjoyment of the rental unit of other tenants. It can be life threatening to other tenants (example: smoking fentanyl)
So your drug addict roommate is continuously breaking the lease. Enough reason to evict.

Also: once your landlord knows about the illegal drug use he is permitting an illegal act to take place on his property. 

If none of you report this you make yourself accessories to an illegal act.

So: report your roommate to police, keep the record of when/what you reported. Email your landlord and tell him/her that you have reported the illegal behaviour and that you require him/her to give notice to the roommate in question. (Endangerment, reasonable enjoyment of rental unit etc)

I would read this together with your BF and make a list of what needs to be done.
Most importantly: you have to give your roommate written notice. 

https://legalbeagle.com/8430134-evict-boarder-missouri.html


Serve the tenant with an eviction notice by certified mail and save the receipt. If your lawsuit is for nonpayment of rent, there's no waiting period after you give your tenant the notice. 

(However, if you are breaking the lease for any other reason, you must wait 30 days after the day his next rent payment is due to do anything more.)

Go to the circuit court that serves your city or town after your waiting period has expired. Tell the clerk of court that you want to file either a rent and possession suit if your tenant owes you rent, or an unlawful detainer suit if he has remained in the property without a lease against your wishes. Inquire about what fees are associated with filing a lawsuit. The clerk will prepare a summons, advising your tenant that you have filed the lawsuit and when he should appear in court to defend against it. The county sheriff will deliver the summons to your tenant.

Appear in court on the scheduled day and time. If your tenant does not appear, you win the lawsuit by default and the judge will award you your rent and issue an order allowing you to evict him from the property. If your tenant does appear, be prepared to prove your case to the judge. If the tenant has done something unlawful on your property, take witnesses to court to testify to that. If you have repeatedly sent him letters asking for rent, take copies with you. If you file an unlawful detainer lawsuit, take a copy of the lease to show that it has expired. Take your copy of the eviction notice and the mail receipt.


Wait 10 days after your court appearance. The tenant has the right to appeal the judge's decision if you win your case. He is allowed to stay in your property until this 10-day period expires. If he does file an appeal and wants to stay until it is heard by a court, the judge will require him to post a bond equal to the amount of the judgment.

Contact the sheriff in your county after the 10-day waiting period expires and if the tenant has not filed an appeal. Supply the sheriff with a copy of your eviction order. He will post a notice on your property, telling your tenant when he will return to take possession of the property. This action may require an additional fee; check with the local sheriff's office or court. You are responsible for removing any of the tenant's property that may be left behind."

badroommates,fhy35fq,t3_f5ccld,1581967580.0,"If he isn’t on the lease and you are sharing kitchen and bathroom, eviction is easier than most people think. 
(Depending on your state/province’s laws of course. Considering that Mr X has no $$$ he won’t put up a legal fight - he most likely can’t afford a lawyer or even to file a court case.)

But if you start a mini-war you are giving your roommate a reason to fight you when it comes to getting him out. Be the adult and cover your bases. 

Where I live, a roommate is not covered by the same laws that apply for renters. All that is required is “reasonable notice to quit”. Check your state’s laws if there is something similar.

Considering that your roommate is breaking reasonable requirements of quiet at nighttime, not paying rent etc keep a record of times/dates when he did what. Does he smoke weed? Drugs? Make a note when and what. That gives you the chance to reduce the notice period you give him.

Generally: Give him a written notice (email is fine) and notice to quit by (2-4 weeks). Tell him that on date x his stuff needs to be gone and locks will be changed.

On date X you can go to your local police station, ask for “assistance to remove a person from your property”. You can probably say that you are afraid of him and you don’t feel safe. If they won’t get involved that’s fine too. Exchange locks (it’s not hard, ask your property manager for help or buy a lock and have a screwdriver handy)
Make sure you let your property management company know and give them the new key.
Tell them that Mr X is trespassing after date X and they are welcome to call police if he comes back.

If Mr X still hasn’t removed his things by the time you change locks pack them up CAREFULLY (take pics of what you packed and how well it’s packed) and let him know when he can come to collect them. Don’t just leave them on the street. You are responsible if something breaks or is lost. 

If you can’t afford a lawyer, go to a local support Center who offer free legal advice. Your college/university may have contacts."

They do have classes, but the seating area is just a large dining table and wooden chairs. I also couldn’t tell if they were having a class or not... generally the best selection of yarns up here and comparable prices to the GTA."

knitting,fhuqrhc,t1_fhsz614,1581889221.0,"Ahh great! 
I would follow The Purple Purl, Yarns Untangled, the knit cafe and Ewe Knit (all Toronto)

If you need something more rural:
True North Yarn in Barrie
Serenity Knits and Unwind Yarn House in Newmarket

As soon as you leave the GTA further than 100km it is extremely (!) difficult to find a good yarn store. I’m not even asking for classes. Just good yarns."
knitting,fhuokmv,t1_fhsy8ea,1581888549.0,"Where about are you located? Country? Large city or rural? I’m asking so I can find you a comparable yarn store to follow.

The Purple Purl in Toronto is quite successful- also thanks to the huge fibre arts community in the city. Toronto has more yarn stores than most North American large cities. 

They offer classes with Kate Atherley (the queen of socks), their regulars are other designers, the editor of Knitty etc... 
it took them 7 years to get off the ground and make enough to be profitable and they still struggled at times.

Building your brand will take quite some time, especially if you are building a customer base from nothing. 

Depending on where you are located, find a well known designer or successful teacher and offer a class with them.
Go and participate in fibre art weekends, go to fairs and shows... like the Woodstock Fleece Festival and also local state fairs, enter contests. Make connections, find out what is “a thing”. 

If you need inspiration for a new class or event, look at 2020 knitting retreats and what they offer. Cat Bordhi has a wide variety planned. 

Maybe talk to your local yoga studio and see if they would display one of your shawls and your business cards (call it meditation shawl) - you could even raffle it off to create interest. Yoga and knitting goes well together!"
knitting,fhul7b6,t3_f4qko4,1581887572.0,"Depending on the area you are located at... who are your COMPETITORS? If most of your potential clientele is going to Walmart for yarn, It’ll be difficult to convince them to buy hand dyed luxury yarns. It’s easier if there is a fibre art community, other LYS.

Sometimes adding other fibre art products can help invite more customers and CROSS SELLING to both groups. Knitters often also sew, cross stitchers often also crochet etc...

- SHOWCASE your product every day. Wear your shawls, sweaters, socks every single day. It’s your uniform. Also in spring/summer! Linen, bamboo tees, the Lanesplitter skirt, every single day!

- INSPIRING CLASSES (require people to purchase YOUR stuff for class), not only beginner classes but a wide range like lace knitting, how to fix mistakes, how to make a sweater fit well, how to use magic loop, how to make two socks at a time, how to finish a project (why is blocking important, how to seam a sweater), etc etc.

- COMFORTABLE seating to sit and knit. The unspoken rule MUST be that those who come in purchase at least 1 drink and work on projects purchased in the store. build a community. Regulars will rally around the store and keep a regular stream of income going.

- I don’t think Instagram will help much w your current sales issue. Too much time/effort for too large crowd. Think local - Unless you offer online ordering? 
To get people in the store, create a RAVELRY group (people DO look for local stores on ravelry. I have and still do). 
FACEBOOK works well with local connections. Maybe take out an ad in the local paper - depending where you are. 

- consider visiting other stores, art galleries etc and seeing if they can give you advice for a local business “colleague”. 

- connect with local fibre artists, maybe a nearby Alpaca farm? Local hand dyers? Celebrate your state’s fibre artists, showcase their products, support “buying local” etc...

- DISPLAY a specific finished project with the yarn offered. Like a 1 skein shawl draped on a bust and you can buy yarn & pattern right away. A baby dress from 1 skein sock yarn. Offer INSPIRATION together w the yarn.

- do you have “regulars”? If you do, offer seasonal group projects. Example: decide on a pattern, offer 2-3 yarn options for the project, anyone who wants to join needs to purchase pattern and yarn from you. Then offer a free 1-2 hr evening to “kick off” and cast on as a group, offer a trouble shooting evening after 2-3 weeks, another group event week 5-6, then a finishing party to show off the FO’s after 8 weeks. Take good (!) pictures to celebrate the event online.

- DROP IN CLASSES: you could have a 2 hr open class every week for people to come in and get help with current projects. Charge $10. 
It’s also a good way to steer those people who expect you to teach them for free how to knit or crochet, into a semi-structured class that offers support. This will free up time for you to run the business.

GOOD LUCK"

If you travel a lot you’ll need more money, if you stay in one place for a couple weeks, you’ll need less... will you be ok staying off grid or do you need electricity etc...

Vandwelling is about simplicity, minimalistic living. Less is more. Experiences instead of things.

Some people work as waiters/food service industry. Work for a few weeks, then move on, travel some, find another gig.
Others work remotely, programming, IT stuff, very very few earn more than a meal with blogging.

Barely anyone takes home $5k /month. If that’s something you can’t say good bye to, vandwelling may not be for you. 

Some live off $700/month. 
Some need $2000/month.

Unless you are beyond 50 you’ll likely find a well paying job after your time off.

If financial stability is such an issue for you that you are unable to allow yourself a year off, despite being extremely unhappy, it may be time to talk to a therapist and ask for help finding out why that is. Why is financial stability more important than happiness?"

Oh and also: if your test yarn is 100% acrylic you’ll likely have a bit of a harder time with gauge and keeping the tension. Once you try a wool mix it’s often easier to achieve a bit looser knitting since it has more give/spring in every stitch.

Your cast on is definitely looser than the knit rows. 

How long have you been knitting? With time your tension might ease up a little.

Have you made a test square with interchanging two different colours? That can often add to a tight gauge. If the colour change at the end of the row is worked too tightly it may pucker/add to an even tighter gauge..."

Looks like your levain... at least that’s how I understood it: starter is obviously the starter, but levain is the stage where you add x amount of your breadflour/water to x amount of your starter, let it rise, then add the rest of your ingredients to the levain, knead it into a loaf and let it rise again.

I believe rosemary and sage actually like soil that drains well, so you may need to mix your soil to adjust to that. 
Rosemary likes heat and doesn’t need as much water as other plants, so you’ll need separate containers.

Chamomile should be fine growing in simple potting soil with more moisture.

Look up each herb and how to grow them from seed. There are a ton of YouTube videos to help with tips.

Have a look at MIgardener and therustedgardener - great YouTube videos for beginners."

If you just applied for social support you’ll have your papers ready to go.
Go to your nearest food bank right away to sign up. They will need to see your income/expenses but nobody walks out hungry.

Also: make a list of everything in your pantry/freezer/fridge and plan what you can make with what you have and only buying a few things extra.

And: look up community lunches. Free dinner or lunch served usually at churches or community centres.

Contact CMHA - They have social support workers on staff and can direct you to resources.
Call churches in your area. Some have community nurses or support and can guide you.

Call Yonge Street Mission and ask what organization is in your neighbourhood who could help."

If you decide to contact her boyfriend be prepared for drama with her once she finds out. She likely will. Addicts do NOT like people meddling. Well, nobody does. But a real addict will get extremely upset when you rattle their cage. Addicts put up a serious fight when they feel their addictive behaviour may be threatened.

She is already manipulating you into using your space. That’s what addicts do. 

It’s actually quite amazing how dysfunctional an addiction is and yet how addicts are able to spin masterpieces of deceit.

Long story short: if you think her boyfriend will just see you as a party pooper, but you want to let someone know, see if you can instead get her family’s contact details from him. Tell him you are planning a surprise... whatever... 
They might have a better understanding of her addiction and how to help her... they may be more interested in getting her help than her BF is.

Either way: if you get involved by telling someone, you might have a tough few months ahead. But if she has ever been a friend to you, then she deserves help. Even if it’s just telling her family."

For the ribbing at the bottom you could use a circular needle too if you feel more comfortable with that.

One tip: acrylic yarns will always be less forgiving when it comes to tension. Wool-mix yarns give you more flexibility and “spring” - that’s why it’s also easier to work with. 
The more you practice the smoother your tension will become.

Another thing: stitch markers 
When a pattern says “PM” it means to place a stitch marker. (Those cheap plastic rings in bright colours) It will help with making decreases always at the same spot and will give your hat a nicer finished look.

You can also use stitch markers for your ribbing to make counting easier. Then you won’t run into the problem of having to re-count 2 knit, 2 purl, 2 knit, 2 purl.... until you have more experience. At some point you’ll be able to read your stitches and need less markers.

Keep on yarning!! Have fun!!"
