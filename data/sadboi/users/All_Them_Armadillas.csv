pitbulls,fqw0e5m,t3_gkz4dt,1589689457.0,"Nothing too bad on my end. I take my girl traveling with me and I get snide remarks occasionally not unlike the ones that some troll has been spewing around the sub. The vast majority of the time, though, everyone wants to hang out with her and feed her (if you're in a dog friendly area and feel comfortable, consider keeping a few treats on you for when someone inevitably wants to love on your pup). I do go to dog parks, but only during the quieter hours. Nanas gets along with other dogs well but is a marshmallow; if somepup is a little too excited she gets nervous and hides behind me. Our favorite exercise is hiking the local trails. 

The main thing is just to be mindful. As someone else pointed out, if something goes wrong it's the pibble who is usually blamed. A newfie pawed my girl in the face unexpectedly once and we got glares at the single bark she produced."

pitbulls,fqvaxfl,t1_fqva5og,1589673426.0,"Did you know Chihuahuas, daschunds, and chow chows are far more likely to fail a temperance test than a pit bull? Or that german shepherds and huskies are also considered aggressive breeds (with military and police k9s typically being shepherds specifically trained to attack)? Or that when you look up dog breeds least likely to get along with cats, pit bulls are nowhere on the list? 

ANY dog can injure people, especially if mistreated because it is an ANIMAL. Domesticated or not, ALL animals should be treated as such and good pet owners will understand this. I trained my dog to walk beside me without a leash, but this does not mean I do not use one when we leave the yard because ahe could still react unpredictably. 

Just for shits and giggles, ""pit bull"" is an umbrella term for a group of breeds including Mastiffs and some terriers. Most people cannot reliably tell the difference between dog breeds and are likely to go with whatever terms first come to mind. I worked in a law firm. The number of dog bite cases first reported as a pit bull attack but later determined to be a different breed was surprising.
