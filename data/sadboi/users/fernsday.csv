She's sent you clear signals that she is not interested and any further attempt on your part to get in touch is unwelcome and can be used against you. 

Secondly, I know this is hard but you have to forgive yourself. You were in a bad place mentally and acted from a place of frustration and anger. And it is okay. You are human and we all make mistakes. You have realized your mistake which is a great first step. We make thousands of mistakes in our lives and if we start bearing ourselves  up everytime we err, life would be hell. Take it as a lesson learnt. 

Third, understand her point of view. She ghosted you in the first place which is so fucking rude and people who do it are cowardly. However, your approaching her time and again, as you rightly said, scared her off and rightly so. You acted out of anger, frustration and rejection. While you intentions weren't wrong, your actions were. You cannot do anything at this point to alter her pov. Accept this and move on. That's all you can do right now. Perhaps sometime in the future when things settle down a bit, you can approach her to clarify things. But now is not that time. Let it go. The only thing you can control are your thoughts and your actions. You know you didn't mean any harm. Take peace in that knowledge.

Lastly, you need a distraction. That is to say, you need to stop thinking about this topic continuously and for that you need to engage your mind somewhere else. It is really hard and I empathize with you but grit your teeth and turn your head. Go for a run everyday. Every day. Engage in physical activity. It is one of the most common advice for mental health for a reason. Physical activity will help you in distracting your mind, give you clarity and improve your mood. If you have friends, ask them to hang out. Go for movies, go out clubbing. Engage yourself in your hobbies. Watch the news and critically analyze the headlines, read up on the internet about it, research the F out of the topic. Just any activity that prevents you from thinking about this matter. 

All the best and hope you feel better!"

I go into these crazy self loathing spirals all the time and it is so mentally exhausting. 

Stopping this thought pattern is something I've yet to learn because while in the middle of these spells, it is damn hard to ground yourself and see the thoughts for the exaggerations that they are. What works for me is distracting myself from engaging in these thoughts, something that takes my mind off the thoughts. I'll go chat with someone, watch the news (I find news a very easy distraction because everything has a context so when I read an article or watch a video they will usually reference stuff that i don't know. So I pull out articles and videos to educate myself on the background....and so forth), listen to interviews of people I admire (usually leaves me with hope and motivation), exercise (feel calmer and proud to have done something productive for my health), etc. Basically, while you are knee deep into self loathing, try to stage a distraction by engaging in an activity that pulls you out to engage with the world. For me personally, it gives me perspective and helps me calm down the feelings of self loathing.

Take trains for moving around Kerala- they are cheap, easy to navigate and, as I said earlier, beautiful views. 

Not much to see in Thirvananthapuram so definitely skip it. Imo, your Kerala itinerary is pretty spot-on. Try spending not more than a day in Kochi as there is not much to do there. If you have a couple days here and there, check out Varkala. But only if you can spare the time. There is nothing to do as it is a quaint Beach town. It's like what Goa used to be around a decade before it became too commercialized. Lots of places to practice yoga and chill at the cliff facing restaurants. HUGE expat community.

I think the dhoom film with Bipasha & Aishwarya also created a lot of buzz in terms of fashion. Not overall but what the actresses wore. There was a lot of coverage on the designing of Aishwarya & Bipasha's swim suits."
delhi,f4b63lx,t3_djaolh,1571507384.0,"Westside stores are great. But they're a bit more pricier than your budget. You can get a decent Kurta for about 2000. 

Dilli haat too but you will have to do some hardcore bargaining. 

The shops lining Janpath, on either side of the Janpath Flea market. Again, bargain and you'll get a decent price. 

Tbh, I'm not sure Sarojini mein Diwali type clothes milengey. Maybe try lajpat Nagar main market."

curlyhair,f496pnr,t1_f48gfk6,1571458115.0,Less product + introduce plopping in your routine. Or maybe clip the roots of your hair while it dries.

Precisely this! No one's looking down on them for being lonely but when every other comment has the poster hammering home the point that they are lonely, it gets really annoying. Not to mention, it is expressed in the same 3-4 tired phrases. Drives down the quality."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,f40um3y,t1_f40qnsp,1571308350.0,I was going to say the same! Can replace ear hoops or a choker if you don't have a proper necklace. The jacket is made for high waist jeans and boots combination.

I remember during my teenage years, I would devour YA at breakneck speed because it was so relatable, fun and easy to digest. Haven't read much of John Green but I assume the logic applies. Books that articulate feelings which you aren't able to, a means to escape reality, and a sense of validation. It's great that the YA market is so huge and thriving. And a lot of that credit goes to Green."

Also, what essays do you highly recommend? Besides James Baldwin (because ofcourse!) :) Same question for poems. 

Thanks for taking out the time for this!

Edit: Just noticed that you write for Human Parts which makes me so so happy! It was one of the first online essay collectives that I fell totally in love with. Special mention to Human Parts' Stephenie Gorgopulos who is a marvelous writer and whose writing has put me at ease so many times."

It just can't be that you have been making idiotic points and bringing the tone of this sub down to a Twitter fan club standards and I have a problem with that..no no that  just cannot be the reason.  


>Why are you responding to each of my comments and attacking me personally?

Because you have consistently been making petty, cheap and desperate comments with no sense or logic. We have healthy, civil and sensible discussions here. All your comments have been desperate attempts to either abuse, use cheap language or defend the one couple because you're a fan.    This is a space for proper discussion and not fan war. That is why I am commenting on your comments. Because you are driving the discussion down the gutter- not once, not twice but all the fucking time."
