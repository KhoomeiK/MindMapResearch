So while our censuses are pretty low right now, the acuity and stress on the hospital and healthcare system in general is overall quite high. In example, while we don’t have many patients in the hospital overall in terms of numbers, our ICUs have many patients on life supporting measures such as vasopressors and mechanical ventilation. I can’t speak for everywhere, but this is at least the case in northeast Ohio."

My hesitance for adding a regularly taken anxiolytic is just the fact that my anxiety isn't really on a regular basis and I can calm my self down pretty well almost all of the time. But perhaps I will try taking on a regular basis and see where that takes me. I was thinking, too, that propranolol could help as well with the somatic symptoms.
