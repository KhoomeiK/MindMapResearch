Of course relationships are challenging and hard to work out and there are times when it's difficult to realize what's still acceptable for us, but this is exactly the time when I feel it's important to step back, take a breath and reflect.

I definitely think physical attack is overstepping the line. Being extremely irritated and/or depressed due to hormonal imbalance is one thing, but your situation is something else and I'd say more serious. It almost reminds me of my own mother - she argues aggressively, sometimes even attacks physically and then only moments later, she either wants an apology from that other person or she apologizes for acting a little crazy and yet still denies how serious the situation is (or even that the physical attack happened). It mentally destroyed both me and my dad, because living under one roof was often unbearable... Although PMDD may play a role in your gf's case, I also believe there's another factor contributing to her condition.

sex,fnx2zdr,t1_fnvtwbi,1587330460.0,"I think it's very complicated and kind of ""open to interpretation"" to each of us. It gets even more interesting when we take into account hormonal changes and how our sex drive changes with age and different partners. The level of satisfaction with our partners in bed also impacts sex drive greatly due to, again, hormones and biologic rensponse in our brains. Just like traumatic events and past (very common, sadly). Sex drive is definitely not something constant and it is easily impacted by external factors, which makes it so hard to objectively measure.

In order to be considered for testing by the government, you're required to have at least fever and cough, but not even this will secure you a test. Your chances are even lower if you're young. Having a sore throat without any other problems, especially after a flu epidemic, during allergy season, with an asthma and after having to wear a face mask for multiple hours per week, doesn't really convince doctors in times like these, when 70% of our population has respiratory problems.

Then she went completely beserk and continued hitting me in the head - and trust me, she's really strong. I tried to get away but couldn't. After a few seconds my brother got up from the table, cought her hands and held them behind her back. I ran into my room, locked the door and sat on the floor in shock. Moments later she was kicking the door, screaming at me to unlock it. I just sat there for 2 hours, too scared to get out and leave the house... I'm not sure she ever apologized but even if she had, I was too shocked to accept it. How can a mother do that to her child? I'm a bit mad at myself for not calling the police or social services. I was genuinely scared for my life. That afternoon made me realize I don't have a mother.

As for dating life, it's hard because I expect all men to be like him - ambitious, hard working, kind, humble, intelligent, selfless. He played guitar, he could even build furniture all by himself and he was always showing mum how much he loved her, even at times when she treated him like shit. We were both mentally abused by her, which brought us together in a weird way. But I've come to realize there's no way I could replace him or find someone like him. Everyone is their own person and no two people are exactly alike. I admit I probably have high expectations because of who my father was but I'm constantly reminding myself to be realistic and try to communicate clearly with my partner, when I feel some kind of problem emerging, instead of expecting him to know everything. Losing father figure and your only support system is hard though. I don't wanna put this kind of pressure on my partner, but I can't avoid it completely.

FanTheories,fcypbxt,t1_fcnmhsh,1578084359.0,"I understand where you're coming from, but these days canon is established in all the media - films, tv shows, books and comics. That's why people put so much emphasis on that, because you actually miss out on some parts of the story.  

My sister in law complained about it the other day, when I said something from ROS was a reference to a SW TV show. She got angry sayingshe doesn't give a fuck about the tv shows and that the movies should be ble to stand on their own... Which I get and mostly agree with but the SW universe hasn't worked that way since The Clone Wars came out."
FanTheories,fclvpy3,t3_egm7r3,1577757626.0,"They could easily change the title after the script was completed. It's not set in stone at that point yet. As for the plot - if Ben Solo, the supreme leader of the First Order that destroyed planets and murdered thousands of people of the New Republic, survived, he wouldn't be able just to chill in a desert."
FanTheories,fclueun,t1_fc74q14,1577756716.0,It's in the Vader comics but Lucasfilm Story Group twisted it again and said basically that just because we see it happen it doesn't mean it happened
StarWars,fcc942g,t1_fc7i330,1577595762.0,"> Kylo was communicating with Vader's helmet

This!! It really bothered me until I saw TROS"
StarWars,fcc83nn,t1_fc8e6yh,1577595454.0,"That's true, however many people instantly compare any new SW movie with the originals because that's the ""standard"" in their minds."
StarWars,fcc7gof,t1_fc7fotz,1577595250.0,I loved it too and I too feel like a minority while reading through the thread here. But that's ok. We can all enjoy whatever we enjoy.
StarWars,fbqvlx4,t3_e4ap4o,1577036135.0,I agree. It's good but I'm not crazy about it... at least not yet.
sex,fbgvs3c,t1_fbg909o,1576859717.0,"This could easily be said about men as well. Nothing about this is gender specific really. That being said, enjoying giving oral sex isn't primarily about the taste but rather about making your partner happy."
sex,fbgqpum,t3_ed64wq,1576856378.0,It's totally fine as long as you show interest in your partner's needs. Unfortunately not everyone does.
digimon,fb84uo9,t1_fb7ag7e,1576606187.0,It's Tai's back from the scene that's in the trailer
digimon,fb84oya,t1_fb7e06f,1576606087.0,I'm wondering the same thing. We'll have to wait and see. There's still a chance they won't address it at all.
GradSchool,fauakqi,t1_far4zz7,1576346325.0,I have similar experience. Took one extra year during undergrad but it changed my whole perspective on science and academia.
GradSchool,faevuap,t1_faesoz7,1576009232.0,"I agree but unfortunately no matter who I talk to, the situation seems to be the same everywhere around the world."
GradSchool,faeovds,t3_e8tpwz,1576005118.0,"I live in a different country so this may sound a little off topic but paying about 50% of your wage for rent is normal here. I'm actually quite suprised this isn't the norm in western countries. The world is really going crazy... Anyway, I hope the situation gets better for you!!"
genetics,faeo4gh,t1_fa8mkkr,1576004689.0,"It's rather odd. We need more info definitely.  

Edit: Oh but like someone else already mentioned, they specifically said semen indicating it could be other cells, but then they also quoted the doctor saying he shouldn't be able to create someone else's children. Hard to say what they even found."
genetics,fa8d00j,t3_e7rd0u,1575844559.0,"""But a donor’s blood cells should not be able to create new sperm cells, Dr. Rezvani said. Dr. Mehrdad Abedi, the doctor at the University of California, Davis, who treated Mr. Long, agreed: He believed it was Mr. Long’s vasectomy that explained how his semen came to contain his donor’s DNA. The forensic scientists involved say they plan to investigate further.""  

I hope we get to read the results one day."
