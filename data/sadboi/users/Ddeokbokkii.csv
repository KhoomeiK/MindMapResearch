LearnJapanese,fiu3j7i,t3_f96wg0,1582734532.0,"Honestly don't force yourself to learn in a way that feels like a chore as others have said. If you don't want to learn from consuming Japanese media, then don't. There are other ways to practice like meeting up with others who speak the language or practicing with your family (if that's a possibility).

I grew up speaking Korean at home and English at school or with some of my friends, so I can kind of understand what you mean. I feel like knowing both is important to me. Though I don't necessarily care for Korean television, it helped that I liked to read and listen to music. 

I'm by no means fluent in Japanese but I can say that they aren't as similar as you would think. Grammatically they are similar as they both rely on particles and verb endings. They have similar Chinese loan words too. As well as counters. 

But things like particles in Korean are a lot trickier than in Japanese, as they change based on what comes before. 

Example: 

Ïù¥ / Í∞Ä instead of „Åå

ÏùÄ / Îäî instead of „ÅØ

ÏùÑ / Î•º instead of „Çí

Î°ú / ÏúºÎ°ú instead of „Åß

Then there's the difficulty of Kanji compared to the ease of reading Hangul to throw you off when it comes to Japanese on top of [conditionals.](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/conditional.html)

Obviously this is an extreme oversimplification but you get the idea. It's true that knowing one language is going to give you a leg up on learning the other, but learning them at the same time is really not going to be fun. While they do have similarities, it's definitely not enough. 

If I was in your position I would continue to use and build upon what I already know in Japanese and hang out with others who speak the language. You learn quickly when you have no choice but to speak in the language. Then continue to study Korean in your free time.

From the looks of it, neither are required so don't treat it like it's a race. Language learning is fun, and it's something you can use for the rest of your life provided you stick to it. It's all about learning to adapt and find what works for you. Keep on trying and you'll be fine."

While there isn't a whole lot of stuff specifically on NSFW 3D animation, I would say general tutorials apply to what it is you want to do. Learning how to animate, sculpt, etc. Are all available in tutorials on YouTube.

It doesn't make the art any less impressive to look at. I was making light of how pointless it was to only censor one portion of the genitals (similarly to artists who just overlay tiny bars on different portions of the penis). 

My initial thought is that perhaps the artist either doesn't know how to, or is possibly uncomfortable drawing a clitoris. Their art is quite good so I can't see the former being true.

Either way it wasn't intended to be an insult if it came off that way."

Anxiety,f7qd8ly,t3_dxgsag,1573962225.0,"I used to be extremely against therapy. Thought it was a waste of time and hated the idea of speaking about my life to someone who I had no idea about. However, I have to say it is one of the best decisions I have ever made. I've been seeing my therapist for about a year and a half now. She has taught me a lot of anxiety managing techniques, as well as helped me get on some medication that also helps with managing it.

That's not to say it will go away. Because it doesn't. However learning to deal with it in a healthy way can really go far in making your life overall more enjoyable. When I start to get panicky I just repeat the things I was taught and a majority of the time I can get out of that state of mind fairly quickly. We all have our off days for sure. But going to therapy has caused me to have far more good days than bad. Which is a welcome change if you ask me.

If you go and end up not liking it, try changing therapists first. I'm sure you've heard or read about it a lot, but you really do need to find one you ""click"" with."
