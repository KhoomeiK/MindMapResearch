AskWomen,fiqw9ph,t3_f97qj2,1582652792.0,"he was a great person, he still is, but I just had this gut feeling even though he was super sweet and loving and thoughtful and stuff I still had that feeling. and i know what everybody thinks first: she's overreacting because shes a female and she has all those emotions running wild all the time. not true. I was raised by war vets, etc; so I'm not a girly girl that likes cute things and pink and shit like that, sorry to dissappoint, lol. but anyhoo, he was a player before me and had always reassured me when I asked that he loved me more than anything and would never hurt me like that, but he also kept pushing for threesomes (not with anyone in particular, just a threesome with a random girl in general). but I kept telling myself I'm overreacting and he's a good boi. but then one night he said he was going to bed and headed upstairs to shower. I heard him finish his shower and walk to the bedroom. then I heard him talking....so i snuck up the stairs and listened from the other side of the bedroom door. I'll never forget his words....""you look good."".....""what are you into?""......""no, I don't have a girl.""..... I was floored. I snuck back downstairs while trying my best to not hyperventilate too loud as to not alert him....yet. I threw up in the kitchen sink a few times, our roommate came out and asked if I was ok and I told him and he was shook too. then 5am rolls around and he starts getting up for work. he comes downstairs and sees me sitting at the computer, not turning to look at him or anything, just staring at a black monitor. he asked me what was wrong, and I slowly turn. ""what's wrong?"" I ask him back, clearly enraged (I had a few hours with my thoughts in the dark to calm down and feel the fire light in my soul). ""you look good, what are you into?!"", I yell at him before stomping upstairs to pack my stuff. he follows me, asking what I'm talking about. I tell him to eat dicks and begin to shove clothes and stuff into trash bags, ripping posters off the wall that are mine, etc. the entire time he's crying and begging me to stay. ""fuck. you."", I keep replying to his every whimper. my mom texts me and says she's here. I begin to load my stuff into the back of her SUV. he's still crying and begging and whimpering.... I climb into the passenger seat and ride away, flicking him off without making eye contact one last time. lol and THAT was the day I learned not to trust anyone ever."
