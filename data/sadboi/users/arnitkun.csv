Long answer: 

Online gaming is toxic. I am guy and I had to quit online gaming. It can't be bothered with. 

Some people just don't have friends to play with ( I can understand that some people can't imagine that, not everyone has a working brain) and just bear stuff in the name of playing with people until they can't.

You can't beat a person who isn't playing. Skill is of no use when someone is out to only troll. There are literal teams whose sole purpose is to troll.

I loved lan parties. Too toxic? It will backfire. In the face.

There is one thing I like about online gaming. It shows what humans are, when there are no repercussions.

""Oh but..but there are good people/communities too! Rays of Sunshine!"" Well no rain in worth letting people with their IQ less than their ages shitting on you. Okay, maybe people like that too but shoving this in someone else's face is retarded too."
