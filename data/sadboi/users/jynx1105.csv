SuicideWatch,fmy8hjx,t3_fxz3i9,1586480403.0,"Have you ever thought about lab animal science? You have a science background already... I have been in the field for 12 years and it is really hard to find a good employee. I've assisted in the interview process for our department more than once and I can tell you that I really dont think your credentials will be a problem. 

One of our best hires was a woman who majored in nutrition with no lab animal experience. The field is kind of small,  but if you have any universities in your area that have vivariums it might be an option for you. 
I have alot of problems with social interaction, anxiety and depression and being in this career I think has really worked for me because you get to focus on the animals, not people, and it can be really fulfilling to care for them. And the pay is pretty good even starting out. 
I know many people who were able to use their position in the vivarium to secure jobs as lab techs in the company as well so there is also the ability to get your foot in the door as an animal caretaker, get to know the lab people whose animals you care for, and network that way to get a job you more related to your degree. 
I hope this can help somehow."

I dont have anywhere else I can stay during this. I had 3 break downs yesterday. This morning I am heading to the grocery store. My city has shut down and there was a run on all goods and right now I dont know what I will be able to get. Her diet is very strict because of her problems. I have some foods I have stocked up but other things i have not been able to find for her. At the same time I wonder what is the point because we are going to die anyway."
