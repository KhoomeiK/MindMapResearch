I have been going through the exact same thing for the past few months (26 M) and last night was finally the night where a decision was made. She told me that I haven’t been honest with myself and that I’ve stayed in the relationship because it was comfortable and didn’t want to deal with the pain of breakup. 

We were together for 3 years, and these similar feelings had been around from the start. She was cool, nice, attractive and really got me as a person, and I didn’t want to let go of that. However, during the relationship, I found that I really didn’t see us together long term. She didn’t agree with some important things for me eye to eye, and while she put up with it, I could tell she wasn’t into it. This was a big deal and while I tried to compromise and level with her, I found that it just want going to be good enough for us to truly continue. 

I’d be honest and up front about how you feel, but in a nice way. My mistake was that I didn’t do this earlier, and it let these feelings build which led to a sudden break up but hug it out after a long talk (twice). I really thought we could power through and make it happen, but after last night it’s clear we just can’t continue. It’ll be best for the long run, and it’s better to cut it loose now than have it drag on for years and have it be too late. Good luck man, it’s tough but go with your gut."

I felt like I was seeing some of me in glimpses, and it reminded me how hard it must be for loved ones to watch someone going through that.

Episode 9 was the hardest. Ben's already signed his death warrant but he has no idea, and Wendy is trying her hardest to keep things light, but you can feel the doom on that trip. Ben kept breaking down too, and it was so hard to watch. I can't imagine being in his shoes, and how helpless he probably felt (even though he refused to take his meds or stay in the ward)
