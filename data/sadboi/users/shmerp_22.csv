I‚Äôm not at all trying to imply that a situation like that is the norm, just trying to take the opportunity to laugh at myself and encourage others to do the same ‚Äî or just laugh at me too lol! We all need humor when dealing with such a challenging mental illness.

For background, I‚Äôve been doing DBT for about a year now, and I think that is what allows me the grace to be able to laugh at myself sometimes (emphasis on the sometimes). I completely understand not everyone is at that point in their journey. Heck some days I‚Äôm not either!

I absolutely agree with you that I need to go into this with the knowledge that it will be challenging, and that we need to both put equal effort in and maintain respect for each other‚Äôs boundaries and healing, otherwise it could quickly turn toxic. 

The talk actually went quite well! We both basically feel the same way towards each other, but he is not ready at all for a relationship and I think that creates some of this push and pull we have been experiencing. So we decided the best thing for now is to try and support each other as just friends. What this will look like is only texting for now and getting physical space, see how that feels, and then when we do meet up make sure it is someplace public where we won‚Äôt be tempted to cuddle or kiss or go down that road. Otherwise, having the more than friends thing there on top of his own struggles with vulnerability is just too triggering and very painful for both of us. I hope it works out too, and I‚Äôll keep you updated:) thank you again so much!

I pushed myself past depression and panic attacks until I literally broke, because I felt like I couldn't be seen as a ""quitter,"" even though I was very unhappy with where my life was heading. Yes, it is GREAT to step outside your comfort zone, but there is a huge difference between being a bit outside your comfort zone, and putting yourself in a position everyday where you will be unhappy and anxious and incredibly uncomfortable.

It impacts relationships on a platonic level in the fact that I can sense tiny shifts in mood. I like to explain it by saying that i have a super shitty super power analogous to being able to fly, but I can only fly 1 inch above the ground ‚Äî in my world this means I can almost always accurately read people‚Äôs emotions but I CANNOT read their mind of what caused the emotion and will typically personalize it (what did I do? Are you mad at me?) this can of course be frustrating for someone to have to constantly reassure you, so I‚Äôve had to learn to check the facts of situations and reassure myself.

It impacted my romantic relationships in the sense that I always found myself in very rocky, very toxic relationships because I was so scared of abandonment (causing me to either get clingy and/or distant), and did not understand how to create healthy boundaries. I was also always seeking the other person for validation, which just like the situation above, is incredibly problematic for everyone involved. This is also something I have had to work through with therapy and DBT skills.

One piece of advice I would like to leave you with is that recovery is NOT a straight path. If you relapse, be gentle with yourself.

So my best friend and I were in our senior year of high school, and I had knowledge that her friend's older brother had a little crush on me. We were hanging out in her Jacuzzi and me being the little hoe in training that I was, decides it would be a great idea to invite him to join us. Since it was at midnight and he would have to sneak over, he said no at first (his father was a preacher, hence the rules were pretty strict). SO LITTLE SLOOt ME DECIDES TO TEXT HIM ""If you come over... I have a surprise for you ;)"" WITH A WINKY FACE AND ALL !!

NATURALLY he rushed right over. So we are all chillin' in the hot tub and my friend gives me a look and says ""I'll go get us some waters"" and I'm feelin kind of anxious about my text and not really sure I want to kiss him anymore, so I am like ""I WILL COME WITH."" But she DOESN'T GET my panic signals that I am sending and is like ""NO, IT IS A ONE PERSON JOB YOU STAy HEEERE"" and I am like oh fahck okay we out here boys, commit or eat shit.

So we sit there in complete. Awkward. Silence. Until he breaks it by saying ""... So, you said you had a surprise for me?"" To which I am pretty sure I just laugh choked at. HE THEN SAYS ""I think I know what it is..."" AND THEN HE AWKWARDLY LIKE PUCKERS HIS LIPS AND KISSES THE AIR AND NOW I'M LIKE OH FUCK THIS NOPE i'M OUT ABORT MISSION BUT ITS TOO LATE AND HE LEANS IN AND KISSES ME AND HIS TONGUE FEELS LIKE AN ACTUAL LIZARD JUST LIKE POKIN IN AND OUT OF MY MOUTH SO I PULL AWAY AND I WAS LIKE ""OKAY thank you that is enough"" and he looked really dejected and hurt and was like ""Um... sometimes I don't get women"" and I was like ""Me too, bud"" and then we awkwardly waited in silence until my friend came back with the waters.

BPD,ev8ei0j,t3_cik513,1564277198.0,"When my boyfriend broke up with me (he didn't want to do long distance, and I was absolutely heartbroken), it got really messy real fast. I felt utterly hopeless, and I just decided to use sexual self destruction and had sex with a random guy on tinder. I do it to numb the pain, provide a distraction, I don't actually want to have sex with them or feel anything towards them.

Afterwards, I felt so shitty about it, that I did it again with some other guy, because I felt like scum already, so why not act like it? In the end I felt terrible, and it only made me realize how much I truly loved my ex and wanted to be with him and fight for him.

I tried to win him back and was honest about what happened when we were apart and it seems he can't look past it either -- he said he could never look at me again the same way. So if your gf feels anything like me right now, it is so so guilty, and if there were any way to go back in time and fix it, I would. 

It sounds like you love her and want to make it work, and if it is to work that requires radically accepting that what happened was a mistake. That means figuring out what you need from her to rebuild the trust and love between you. It will take time and communication to get through the hurt, and some self reflecting of what you need from her to get past this.

For now, just focus on self-care and getting through, and try to find little things you can do each day that might bring some happiness, or treat yourself to little things that won't be triggering.

This made it a compromise between him getting the space he needed, but also me feeling more secure that he wasn't just ignoring me forever and I had no idea when I would hear from him again. 

As for the comment about him not sure how much longer he wanted to do it, that is so tough to hear and I am sorry it is so painful and scary. Maybe it would be helpful to have a discussion more about how he is feeling and where this stemmed from? It can also be helpful to do so with a therapist if that is possible for you, as they can really help moderate discussions and help both sides understand what the other person is feeling.

gatech,eq4w7ka,t1_eq4vvoy,1559787444.0,THANK YOU okay you're wonderful! I was so worried haha
BPD,eoh3yl5,t1_eogc87c,1558572331.0,Aggreeeeed but I think I am in the same boat as you:/ It is hard to NOT have a FP when we are so used to coping that way. I think DBT skills and therapy is at least allowing me to have less of an attachment to my FP if that makes sense at least? It's a start!
BPD,eoh3rpi,t1_eoga9b3,1558572200.0,"Agreed, I wholeheartedly think he does not deserve you for ghosting you after finding out you are suffering and in pain from BPD. You deserve love and support wholeheartedly"
BPD,eoh3idk,t3_brumea,1558572020.0,"I also checked myself in, a few months back. I think the fact that you are choosing to get help is really brave and it sounds like you have really thought about this choice. I'm not sure if you have ever been in a psych ward before, but just in case you have not, it can be a little bit scary and invalidating, so I just want you to go in with that information so that maybe you can offer validation to yourself if that does happen. With that being said, I do think you are doing the right thing since you said you are feeling on the verge of suicide. Thank you for choosing to get help and take care of yourself -- please feel free to reach out if you need anything<3"
BPD,eoh2rff,t3_brqjw5,1558571515.0,"DAE get so engrossed in reading or movies that you literally take on not only traits of the character, but moreover their emotions? Like if I am reading a book where a couple is happy, I feel extra in love with my partner, or if I am reading a book about a dysfunctional relationship I start feeling like mine is too? :/"
