Thetruthishere,fq7solf,t1_fq74z52,1589151408.0,"I genuinely thank you for clarifying that. 

Anyhow, Google deja vu and seizures and temporal lobe seizures pops right up. I'm not a doctor either, and I'm literally just posting the first link-- but there are SO MANY psychological reasons that releate to it. Please, no one make me name them all. Google it yourself if you're not sure.

To reference, I kept having deja vu and depersonalization/derealization = result of panic issues. If OP had premonitions, pretty different. Not what this sounds like, though."

serialkillers,fnpeork,t3_g2tp3m,1587144192.0,All great points. Another issue was the lack of communication between law enforcement agencies. Dahmer was a registered sex offender on probation meeting with his PO 2x a month. The cops never told her they talked to him when they stopped him with Konerak S. She had an overwhelming caseload and because Dahmer was considered so compliant (most sex offenders on probation are) she never did a home visit.  The victims families tried to sue her for that.probation blamed police and lack of communication
SuicideWatch,fnbmeul,t1_fnbc6ar,1586818135.0,"Yes. I don't think its removable. One of the best analogies I heard was comparing it to a cheeseburger. If its a food you love, you're not going to stop loving it. But you can go without eating it. And you should probably stay out of burger joints."
SuicideWatch,fnawgpu,t1_fn9o7ne,1586805036.0,"In my opinion and time dealing with the research, individuals, conferences, trainings, books, and the years of constant work with the offenders every day...etc- Orientation is what you're born with. People are not born attracted to shoes or going too far at parties with drunk people. Being interested in having sex with horses is not an orientation. Those are lack of understanding, caring and/or paraphelias. I'm actually offended you would compare pedophilia to the LGBTQ community. NAMBLA disagrees- but that as the only justification they've got to go on and its fucking weak. 

 There is a lot of controversy on what makes someone a pedophile so I can't expect everyone to agree. Any source you want is indeed subjective, so I won't bother trying too hard digging it up. Professionals don't agree on it. I just go with what I've seen. Sexual behavior is Pavlovian in my opinion. Orientation is not. Gender is not a specific condition. Its not a fetish. Once you're classically conditioned to have a sexual preference for children or dogs, however, you're unlikely to ever stop. 

I think citing sources on internet conversations in a suicide subreddit is obnoxious. Pretentious to ask. Pretentious to provide. But a good read is Predators by Anna Salter. She pioneered a lot of the early research, but its always changing.There is also a huge difference between juveniles and adults. 

I find this shit super fascinating so I could go on forever."
SuicideWatch,fn8zabw,t1_fn8y7r5,1586754428.0,"Oh and look up how sex offenders are managed in your state/country while on probation. Sex offenses don't get much time for their crimes, so- like any crime, they get put in treatment. I think calling a CSOTP might be easier in the short run though."
SuicideWatch,fn8y7r5,t1_fn8fwtg,1586753528.0,"You should def call the CSOTP 7 hours away. Given the pandemic, right now is the perfect time because therapists are resorting to video calls. Even if they can't treat you from where they are, they probably have a ton of places to suggest that you might not be able to find easily on your own. 

Depending on your age, 4 hours is higher than avg. Especially if you say your sex drive is low.

Regarding the fear of offending, its really important you have empathy for any possible victims. It makes it a lot less likely you will act on it. 

Do not listen to some advice here suggesting you lean into questionable porn to avoid offending. It does NOT make you less likely to offend. It feeds the fantasy. Instead, managing depression/anxiety is great. Aversion therapy is pretty good and easy. You get fox urine and essentially smell it whenever a deviant fantasy starts to kick up. We LEARN sexual behavior- people are not born pedophiles. They also rarely want to be one. But you can work at negatively reinforcing it and try classical conditioning to try and reduce a favorable response. 

Also, we wary of support groups that are not professionally facilitated. They can become dangerous echo chambers. 

Suicide by someone who is actually being honest with themselves before they have a reason to be is tragic. I have dealt with the most prolific pedophiles who live and breathe for abusing kids and they live long lives. 

You're not alone in this. You are still you. This is a small piece of who you are and it can be managed. There is so much help for you."
SuicideWatch,fn8djzo,t3_fzu0jt,1586739249.0,"I work with sex offenders for a living. About a 3rd for possession of  child pornography. A lot of folks on here are saying it symptomatic of your OCD, which it totally could be. 

But the fact that people jump to the most socially acceptable reason to explain away pedophilia is how this gets overlooked and untreated in the first place. 

You called yourself a pedophile and acknowledged it. That's brave. 

Statistically, people in your position tend to be white men in their late teens, early 20's. Usually a pretty good childhood. They're smart, too. Above average and often well educated. Downside is this type tends to have a higher attraction to kids, more so than the people who are ""contact offenders"". The upside is the online guys are a lot more pro-social and, because they know its not right,  they are actually less likely to act on it. This is not every online offender- its a very mixed bag. I am also no expert.

My own opinion completely but, have you ever been diagnosed with aspergers and, on average, how many hours do you look at porn in a week? 

Good news! Google a CSOTP! Its a Certified Sex Offender Treatment Provider. They can help with everything. Treatment is there."
nova,fn82rkl,t1_fn7ncej,1586732685.0,"You gotta cope with the horror of real life by framing the perpetrators in such a way as to almost forgive them for their ignorance of the consequences. If they were competent, vile people, you wouldn't have a show. Also, they say in the documentary that Joe Exotic burned the animal abuse footage in an ""accidental fire"". By the end of the series, you can see the effect it had on the people. A guy half passing out on drugs crying about the abuse he witnessed. Some of them had a level of regret. Except Joe Exotic. On all levels you have to ask  ""how did this get that far out of hand for so long?"". But....thats just the shit we KNOW about. And that bitch Carole Baskin."

Virginia,ff3n6ep,t1_ff2exxh,1579544634.0,"The smaller states dont represent the larger population. Why should Alabama have as much input to dictate laws affecting California? Again, the US is a big animal and we can't fix it for everyone. However, what works for weapons laws in a place like Barstow is not what would work in Chicago. I get that popular vote won't address that issue. However, I think in the bigger picture, we risk more not to consider the larger population being affected. In equal rights laws and so forth. Or should we all return to segregation laws because some small towns still prefer it? Should they get as much of a say? Some issues are bigger than a state and must be based on popular vote. Otherwise some places would stay in the dark ages and keep the rest of us there or slow us down from moving g forward. But that's pretty much where we're at."
