I'm a vegetarian, and I'd say I eat heathfully, but I don't claim to be eating super clean. The brownie is homemade. I have two of the meal replacement bars (other one couldn't fit on the screen) and they have 32g of protein each, so they are essentially my protein shakes because shakes fill me up wayyy too much and make me feel awful. Trust me, I've tried lots of different kinds. I've never been the type to be able to drink my calories, I can't even drink half a milkshake if I wanted to. 

This screenshot is from the fitbit app, and that app won't allow you to have a meal plan above maintenance, which is why it says ""over budget"". This day has 3,128 calories — I'm 22M, 5ft10, I work an active job and exercise on my days off. Hope that's enough context for you, lol."

No joke, though. I eat from about 2pm to midnight because breakfast also makes me gag, and I have no problem getting in my calories. Of course, you have to eat more in a smaller amount of time, but it really shouldn't be that difficult after the first week. I eat high fat, high protein, and the calories come easy without having to stuff myself.

Things are a little harder on work days (I'm spending a lot of time at home right now), but even then, I can still get 2,000 calories in from 5pm-10pm if I need to because I slacked on eating at work. You can 100% hit your calorie goals without eating in the morning."

My thought process has always been that the animals we tend to eat just don't have a fair chance. In the wild, an animal gets killed because it is overpowered by another animal. Unless it is sick, injured, or elderly, the prey usually has a fair chance of getting away due to the evolutionary processes of predators and their prey. 

As humans, we let someone else kill our animals with machines and we never even have to interact with the process. The animals are raised to be killed, and they stand no chance against factory farming. Even hunters have a much higher advantage than their prey animals, being able to shoot them with guns or arrows, but the ethics of hunting wild animals are much different than factory farming. As it has been said, factory farming is horrible for the environment and horrible for the animals - I really can't think of any reason to continue factory farming other than meeting the current demand for meat, which isn't a good reason in my eyes.

Because humans have changed the ecosystems so much and have pushed out lots of predators, there is often an overabundance of prey animals, especially near where humans live. In this case, hunting is a very ethical solution and often is necessary to conserve vegetation and other wildlife in the area. Deer can destroy habitats and their populations can skyrocket so much that they will start starving to death because there are too many of them, and hunting can help alleviate this. A fast death from a bullet is much more humane than slowly starving over the winter. It really depends on the ecosystem, though, and the population dynamics of the area. Lots of studies have to be done before determining whether a population should be specifically culled, as sometimes the decrease in population will cause their numbers to bounce back even higher than before, but in general, killing an animal for meat via hunting is much more ethical than buying meat at the grocery store, especially if you are participating in a wildlife management program and thinning out an overpopulated herd. 

All in all, it isn't a case of meat = bad. The ethics lie in how the meat is obtained, and the relative suffering that the animals and their environments are going through when certain populations are being killed for meat."

I'm not pissed that he's playing video games with his friends, what I actually want is an evening where just the two of us can be together because I feel lonely, etc.

I feel like I have an easier time doing this than my partner (though by no means am I perfect at it, it often takes me several of the same situations before I realize that the emotions I'm having on the outside are part of a deeper feeling), and I wish there was an easier way for me to help him reach those conclusions. Obviously I just have to take him at his word when he expresses an issue, there's no way for me to truly know why he is feeling a certain way.

Things like trying to be cuddly when we watch shows (I'm just not always cuddly, so he saw it as rejection), asking me like twice if I wanted to hang out at midnight after he played video games with his friends (ummm, I'm going to bed...).

Finally, he got very upset while we were arguing and out came the fact that he felt unwanted and like I loved my friends more than him because I was always with them! Well howdy-doo partner, check this out - if we make plans in advance, I will schedule seeing my friends around those times so we can hang out together!

Poor thing makes so many assumptions and gets it all up in his head that I hate him, and the solution is as simple as directly telling me what is wrong so that I can fix it. We don't have the same natural threshold for how much interaction is necessary to feel loved, so of course I thought I was giving him enough attention.

Sometimes it's very relieving when you finally figure out what you've been ""doing wrong"" and can fix it so easily. Although it's super annoying that it happens, but I know I've done it on accident before so I can't complain too much."
science,f0nxsjp,t1_f0mx3n1,1568784956.0,"Same here! I think it's actually one of my better coping skills - unless something seriously bothers me and I think the person needs to know that I was affected by their behaviour, I just move on from whatever the minor issue was. Then, in an argument, I can only ever think of one of two things that may have bothered me recently, and they have a laundry list for me. I'm over here like, doesn't it feel shitty to hang onto those little frustrations every day? Just call me an asshole in your head and then move on, you'll feel way better!

(only with minor problems though, like someone being short with you because they're in a bad mood and they'll be fine once they have dinner, etc., not overarching problems in which you should rethink the relationship)"
boardgames,f0l16ii,t1_f0ky55q,1568694446.0,"Totally agree for my friend group. I have played Root once at the gaming group that I attend, and everyone was honestly a little frustrated at the game then (all new players) because we didn't understand how everyone else was winning and the woodland alliance just ended up winning because they weren't dealt with early. It felt cheap to everyone else, who was just trying to grasp how their faction played. We agreed that it would probably be more fun with several playthroughs in different factions.

Not trying to diss my slightly-more-casual group that I play with at home, but... I cannot imagine explaining completely separate rules to three other people who play way fewer games than I do. Even so, if everyone doesn't know ALL of the factions, the scenario like I explained above might happen. I can see it being fun for a group that finds it easy to follow new rules and likes to play the same game many times, but yes, for our groups it just wouldn't work. Too bad!"

AskReddit,ezwhnp2,t1_ezw9m1f,1568216906.0,"Well, I do put water on the cloth first, so it's basically like a reusable baby wipe. I feel pretty clean, way more clean than with dry toilet paper. But no, I don't get grossed out by the poop. It's my poop, cleaning it up feels the same level of gross as it does with normal toilet paper."
CPTSD,ezvipup,t3_d2b202,1568179791.0,"Definitely! I'm not too horrible at this anymore, but I do have a problem speaking up about it still. Sometimes it's hard for me to know what I want to do the most (aka prefer) when I'm asked to do something. I'll just spit out things I could do and have the other person choose because I would SO much rather them just pick something and me put up with not wanting to do it the most, than me saying what I want to do and having them not want to do it. Like, whatever, I'll do what you want!

But of course, that's a good way to become resentful of someone for never doing what you want to do. So, I try to speak up when I actually do know what I want. Lately I'm able to say what I DON'T want, which is better than nothing, at least."

CPTSD,eytoion,t3_cynq1x,1567441806.0,"This sort of happened to me too! I didn't get moved to a new school, but when I was 13 my mom took me to an autism specialist therapist, who diagnosed me with high functioning autism. My mom loved that, because that meant I was acting out because of my brain and not because of our crappy family situation.

Turns out that being developmentally delayed emotionally, fixating on certain hobbies, and constantly isolating are also signs of a kid growing up with abuse. Glad I finally figured that one out."

I assumed she was jealous that a student was better than her. She was honestly an asshole, would talk my art up behind my back but then ignore me during class."
BPD,exggzig,t1_exfz3oc,1566263821.0,This 'crazy' feeling you're having is due to being gaslit by him. That is abusive. You definitely need a game plan for getting out of there - ask friends and family for help while you work on the disability and possibly getting a part time job.
Cooking,exgg3r9,t3_cslhft,1566263172.0,"I use beeswax wrap in place of plastic wrap for certain things. If it's basically just to cover something in the fridge, that or a cloth will work. Still not sure what to do for things like cinnamon rolls, where I need the plastic so I can roll it up and not have the dough stick to everything... But I basically never make those.

Use reusable everything, ditch the paper towels. Just use old handcloths or cut up old tshirts. Throw them in the wash with vinegar on hot and they will be super clean. Make your own snack portions of things instead of buying smaller, prepackaged portions. Shred your own cheese from large blocks. Go to a bulk store if you have one near you, and bring glass jars to fill up there. Use cloth produce bags for your produce, bring a container to the meat counter if your grocery store allows it (some say that it's a health issue... Usually it isn't, so you might want to press them and ask for a manager because the person working may just be trying to make sure they won't get in trouble/doesn't know how to tare the scale. Always worth it to ask for more info).

Honestly though, reducing food waste is your best bet. Make proper portions, use everything you buy, try to use scraps in broth if you can (freeze and save em up) or get a small compost bin. Compost can be hard if you live somewhere cold or in a place without city composting, so don't stress too much about that. I wish the infrastructure was more widely available.

Also - reducing your meat and dairy intake does wonders for the environment, much more so than skipping one plastic bag at the produce section. Look into changing your diet, slowly if you need to. And check out r/ZeroWaste"
ptsd,exflw5g,t3_csl9zz,1566243411.0,"I have the same issue, but probably to a more extreme degree than you at the moment. Honestly... I just refuse to date anyone who likes alcohol. My partner drinks a beer or two at special occasions (weddings, trips with friends) and I just don't accompany him to those things. He doesn't ever get drunk, so I don't have to think about it too much when he's out. We don't keep alcohol in the house. 

It's such a big trigger to me that I would 100% leave the relationship if he wanted to drink more, so, I'm not sure what to tell you. You have the right to not be around alcohol as much as your partner has the right to drink."
Teetotal,exfihoj,t3_csjcq3,1566241287.0,"Sometimes partners change. If you don't wanna be on that boat and you guys can't come to an agreement, it's time to get out of there.
