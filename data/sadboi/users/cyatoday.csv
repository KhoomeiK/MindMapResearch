Goes on to say why Latinx people don't get to define their pronouns because they don't speak Spanish. I \*am\* Latinx and I don't speak Spanish fluently, but as a Latina I admire the always forward mentality of my fellow Latinx people. It feels good that we feel so strongly about our identity that we don't exclude half the populations by gendering it."
politics,f7en5ps,t1_f7efxla,1573661459.0,"The same happened to me. When I tried to learn Spanish, I was shunned by the Latinx community because I stumbled and didn't have the correct cadence. So I stopped learning Spanish. I grew up poor and even my family members looked down on me so now that I'm not poor I make sure to stuff it in their poorer than me faces that they hate poor people who, given the resources, would escape poverty (which is awful). The best revenge is living well, but for me.. the GREATEST revenge is pulling other people up. My therapist asked me why I thought I made it out of that situation, and easily I responded, ""because other people who had been where I was turned around and pulled me up."" If you ever think that one day you volunteer at the impoverished school to show them your profession or art or just to be a stranger with a kind demeanor to children who are treated like trash is worthless - I am here to tell you that you are wrong. Some of the most important memories from my childhood are those people. Thank you to all of you out there making a difference because you don't get to see what happens, but I promise you are pulling people out. It's a slow process."
politics,f7emk2n,t1_f7eewi0,1573661066.0,"When you immigrate from another country, the welcome you get is not welcoming. Your ways are foreign and people are mean to you so you want your children to have an easier life and encourage them to assimilate. This leads to an alignment with white. It is difficult to align with an ideal and not let it infect you."
politics,f7emei1,t1_f7elk4l,1573660967.0,People okay with throwing babies in cages while they die from neglect is actually pretty Nazi-ish. You don't get to keep the word and hold it dear to mean the one thing it means to you. White Nationalism is Nazi-ism and the people who do not want people like me to be here... on this Earth... are Nazi's. Whether against Jews or brown and black people.
politics,f7em57h,t1_f7ebdes,1573660797.0,"Latina, family is exactly the same. I still talk to them, but they don't talk politics around me except to say snipey things that I immediately rebuke to their horror and ""why do you always have to be like that"" because we are the people they hate and you think saddling up with white will have you accepted as white, but they'll never accept you. I know, I'm white passing as well and while I don't have love from my fellow latinx people... I do not have the love of white people either. Fuck it... babies in cages is a step too far for me."
