vinyl,fojrp42,t3_g7thpl,1587827970.0,"What others have said about dynamic range in a song. The more treble a section of music has, the more sparkly and chaotic it looks; the more bass, the more spread out the grooves; the quieter the section, the shinier and more packed together the grooves.

When cutting the master for a record, a computer in the lsthe ""looks ahead"" by a couple of seconds to calculate how close or far apart and how deep the grooves need to be spaced to avoid collisions and skipping. When a song alternates between very quiet and very loud, you get this. Normal average for loud sections on an LP is 175 to 200 lines per inch (lpi). 45 rpm singles are usually louder, so 140 to 165 lpi. Dance club maxi singles are louder still, 105 to 120 lpi. Conversely, total silence can be anywhere from 300 to 500 lpi. Multiply this by the available space on a record (1 1/8"" for a 7"", 2 3/8"" for a 10"" and 3 3/8"" for a 12"") then divide by the speed to get running time in minutes. The cutting engineer takes this, the ratio of loud to quiet, how much bright trebly material is at the end of the side and to what degree the customer wants the record to look ""full"", when determining the lathe settings before a cut.

What's really fun is when treble percussion (especially with drum machines and sequencers post 1980) is very close to a multiple of the record speed. Then you get pretty spirals moving inward and/or outward as the record spins."
vinyl,fogdg4d,t1_fogb94v,1587751163.0,"Yup. Boosted upper midrange and (especially) treble are the bane of cutting engineers - the RIAA curve means treble is boosted during cutting and lowered during playback to reduce hiss and surface noise, so extra treble on top of that can make for nasty distortion on playback, or worse yet fry the expensive cutterhead. The cutting stylus can even accelerate so fast that the back edge wipes out what the front edge just cut, meaning 100% distortion even on fine-line playback stylus, and a ruined cut."

22 2/3 is on the short side of scale lengths, so I'd stick with heaver strings, 10s or maybe even 11s. Any lighter and it will get sloppy - hard strummed chords will go sharp and then flat.

But again, once the strings are on and settled in, check the intonation (harmonic and fretted note at the twelfth fret are the same, string is in tune all the way up the fretboard) and action (how far the strings are off the fretboard, a matter of preference but frustrating if it's too high). The former is fixable by adjusting the bridge saddles; the latter somewhat with the bridge saddles but more likely a truss rod adjustment or neck shim which I'd strongly recommend a guitar shop tech handles.
