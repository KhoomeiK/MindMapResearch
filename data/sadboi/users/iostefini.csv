Maybe she found out she was pregnant and didn't want to abort on a 50% chance that her child *might* experience something that she already knows is bearable, because she lives with it herself. I don't think that's selfish (though maybe irresponsible if she was having unsafe sex, but we don't even know if that happened either).

You need BOUNDARIES. If you need space, take it. Don't ask her permission, tell her what you're doing. Like ""I'm going out with friends on Friday"" or ""I'm planning a few hours of alone time this evening"". Then do it. If she tries to invite herself along, its ok to say ""I really wanted to be alone, sorry"". 

If she guilt trips you by saying things like ""oh but I'll get lonely"", go anyway. If its a genuine suicidal crisis, of course stay with her and get her help, but generally ... she'll be fine on her own. 

If you're her only friend, that's not your concern. If she wants more friends, she can make them. If she doesn't, then she can just not have them. Her decision. (I know its more complex than that once you get depression involved, but ultimately it is NOT your responsibility to create a social life for her, its hers. If she needs help working out how, she has a therapist for that.) 

In short, work out what you're willing to give her or do for her. Anything beyond that, say NO. You will feel like a bad person because no one ever wants to say no to someone they love, but if you don't look after yourself it will destroy you and then you won't be able to help her OR yourself. It's ok to say no to someone when they ask for something you can't give them. 

If she's unhappy with what you can offer her, she is free to leave you. If you're unhappy in the relationship even after you've tried to set boundaries, you are free to leave her too. You're not her caretaker or her parent and the fact you care about her is a wonderful thing, but not something that means you have to babysit her forever."

They have a lot of other stuff on that website too, like how to initiate tough conversations. That might help too. 

Your characters would probably have more difficulty because the counselors etc. would not be trusted adults that the child already knows, so the trust would have to be built over time. 

Also extreme trauma like that is not something everyone would be able to recover from. It would be inevitable that some children would struggle severely.

I think if you want to make it more obvious, it could come across in HOW she says it. If the tone and actions don't convey the emotions she says she has, then it shouldn't need the wording to reveal her insincerity. For example, she brings some people on stage and talks about how ""I'll always have time for the victims of this event"" and then turns away from the mic and says ""ok you can go now"" and points down the stairs, then turns her back on them and continues her speech. That shows her actions don't match her words. 

If she's hiding that she cares more than she's letting on, you could let her tone or actions demonstrate that too. Maybe her voice shakes or maybe she looks at the person she's talking about (or maybe she avoids looking at them?). That shows she has more emotion than she wants to share in words. If the tell is that she avoids looking at someone, its probably better to either make it very obvious, or to have another character notice it (otherwise the audience might not notice). 

She could also start saying something and then cut herself off mid-sentence, or change direction mid-sentence after a short pause. Like ""I've been thinking a lot about-- actually let's talk about that later, for now I want to focus on ..."""

I was so scared the first time I went to see my psychologist too, but she has helped me so much :) Sometimes you just need to find a way to do something even though it's scary. 

A professional will not think you're exaggerating. What you describe sounds like symptoms of a mood disorder (like anxiety or depression) and a professional will be able to help diagnose you and help you get treatment. 

I don't know what country you're in, so the process might be different where you are, but in my country this is what happens: 

* You go to a GP (can be your regular doctor or a different one if you prefer) and tell them you've been having mental health problems 
* They ask you lots of questions about your symptoms. They are mostly very easy questions (like ""how long has it been happening?"") but if you don't know the answer, it's ok to just say you don't know. 
* They write you a referral to a psychologist 
* You call the psychologist and make an appointment (usually there is about 3-6 months waiting period between when you call and when the appointment takes place) 
* You go to the psychologist with your referral and they discuss with you what the next steps should be (e.g. how they can treat you, if they think you should see a different specialist, how many sessions they think you might need, etc.) 
* They might give you some tasks or things to try between sessions. If they don't work, that's ok, just tell them you tried and it didn't work. 
* You keep going to the psychologist regularly until you don't need them anymore

If the process is different in your country, your regular doctor will probably still know who to get in contact with or who you should see for help. If you're in a country where mental health is not so well-known, it might be harder to find the right place, but there will be something. Just keep searching until you find one. You could also try asking people you know or people from your country to see if anyone knows a good doctor/psychologist to try, or even just calling the psychologist office and asking what you need to do to make an appointment. 

Also keep in mind that sometimes you meet a professional who is not helpful. There are bad doctors and bad psychologists just like there are bad workers in every profession. Even some professionals are good for one person, but terrible for another person. If you happen to get a bad one on your first try, don't give up. You can just go see a different one."

She shouldn't apologize for not wanting it. She is allowed to choose what she wants to have happen. 

>Why should any woman, ever, not be extremely alarmed at a man who openly wants to degrade and abuse her?

I think, based on the comments below, you're equating kink and abuse. I am extremely alarmed by men who want to degrade and abuse me. I am NOT extremely alarmed by men who know they have a degradation kink (but I'm also sexually incompatible with them). 

>Why isn’t DD/lg a massive, immediate, red flag, regardless in men, regardless of consent?

A man who wants to take care of me and treat me with kindness and respect and love should be an immediate red flag regardless of whether I want him to do that or not? Really?? 

It's not a massive red flag because sometimes I like being taken care of, especially by a man who treats me as an equal most of the time. If occasionally he wants to take care of me like I'm young and need protection, that's just a really sweet thing for him to do and I'm not going to be insulted by it. Maybe I'll do it for him too sometimes. 

>At  what point can we say “this man is a sexist monster”?  Shouldn’t it  really be the first time he suggests he wants to call you a whore?

I mean, if he said ""I want to call you a whore"" then yeah I'd be put off. If he said ""I have a degradation kink and it turns me on when I can indulge it"" then I don't think labelling him a monster is fair. It's not like he IS degrading me at that time, is he? If he started calling me a whore out of nowhere then yeah I'd ditch him, but asking permission and accepting my answer is fine by me. Also, knowing that a man is into something I'm not into (e.g. degradation) does not mean that he's a monster. It just means we're incompatible. 

>I feel like women are being groomed to be too accepting of abuse and gaslighted out of being alarmed by it by calling it “kink”.

I'm not sure why you feel this way. Most people who engage in kink are perfectly able to separate kink and abuse because they are very different things. 

>If his kink involves demeaning behavior of women, why shouldn’t we shame the hell out of it?  Especially on a sex sub for women?

Because **some women are into that too!** We'd be shaming those women. Also, shaming ANYONE for their sexual preferences is unfair. Shaming someone for being abusive is fine. Shaming someone for mentioning they have a kink is not.

It also sounds like the counselor is used to dealing with vanilla couples - in a vanilla relationship, the relationship is meant to be a partnership between equals, and its wrong to expect your partner to be a CG. It's different when you have a kink relationship where you have explicitly negotiated that your partner will take a CG role and they have agreed to it, which is what you did. You could try opening up to your counselor about the situation, but if they're not kink-friendly they may not understand. Be prepared for it to go either way. 

If it doesn't work with this counselor, it might be worth finding a kink-friendly one to try with instead.
