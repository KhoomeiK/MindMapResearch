mbti,flyu6xz,t1_flyq7ua,1585609182.0,Thank you I found your input very informative. I am trying to avoid major errors like confirmation biased. Based on the discussions above and all the ideas mentioned I know I am XNTP for sure.
mbti,flyk3mi,t1_flyegma,1585603639.0,"- do you make friends easily or are you hard to get to know?

I can fake enough social norms to make acquaintances but keeping up the charades is draining and I soon resort back to being alone. I guess I am difficult to get to know since my social interactions are me thinking I need to do this since society wants us all to have friends and I quietly chip away inside until I ghost whoever. For example my natural facial expression and speaking voice and topics of choice I have been told are offensive or off putting. I then try to adjust to what others are doing and I find it exhausting so I then limit my time with others. If I cant be my natural self why bother.  

- do you love large parties or do you prefer to be alone?

I despise social gatherings. I need to be alone and spend my free time alone. I can't stand working in environments with large amounts of people. Basically how quarantine has had society separated is my norm.

- do you take charge or wait for others to lead the way?

I can initiate for something to start but taking charge isn't my forte. I don't want to lead or follow but would like to live my life the way I want in independence. I wouldn't mind leading indirectly or at a distance, for example through books or sharing opinions that people found helpful or resourceful.

- are you always busy or do you like to take it easy?

There is always something for me to work on and I like to focus on meeting my goals. However I can slack off. Either way my time is spent towards self fulfillment.

- do you love excitement or do you dislike loud music?

Being a musician excites me. I create music and sing often, I wouldn't want to adjust my volume for anyone and I wouldn't want them to adjust for me. That being said, I do not like surprises or being obligated into being part of other peoples excitements or loud events. I don't want to be obligated into pretending to care about anyone but I respect others to live their lives the way they want if what they're doing makes sense ofc.

- do you radiate joy or are you seldom amused?

Yes I think my joy can appear similar to madness or awkwardness since I am trying to vibe off the situations to fit in. I am seldom amused when socializing but I pretend to radiate joy and act as if I care when caring isn't what is most important to me, leading to burnout and ghosting. I am more amused by my own antics and inside jokes. I guess I could view social interaction even more so as a game so I won't fizzle out as quick as I currently do."

mbti,flycq31,t1_flxw0jb,1585599706.0,"I just took the Big Five:

O - 83%, C - 19%, E - 40%, A - 23%, N - 73% 

High neuroticism could be from my PTSD

Low extroversion could be bc I prefer to be alone and prefer one on one interaction but I initiate when around people usually bc I am anxious and uncomfortable and am trying to fit in. I find interactions longer than 45 minutes exhausting. 

C and A,  I am not very organized and I do things on a whim but remain competitive and search for the underlying truths in communication.

High openness makes sense. I enjoy solving lives mysteries and pushing the envelope to advance my life purpose.

It’s hard for me to share these things when the professionals make fun of me call me names and roll their eyes. Or minimize it or say it’s in my head bc the things I share don’t happen to them so I must be confused. Talk about a load of crap. 

As far as work goes I’m never going back. I will will work remote, freelance, and do side hustles as I grow as an entrepreneur. 

I agree with what you’re saying especially about the it only takes one toxic person to harm you.

I’ve tried talking to my family. There is a lot of abuse in my immediate and distant family. But my immediate family is safer than me having a job and living on my own so I stick with them.

This really doesn't have enough information, so you're gonna get some of the questions you hate so much. (Most of your description is just ""like music, don't like people"")

I hate my family and find them a bunch of idiots. but i enjoy time with them more than anyone else so what can you do.

Why do you enjoy time with them? Why do you hate them? What makes you think of them as ""idiots""?

**Bc they are easy to interact with I already know what they expect and can easily fit into a social role. I am close with my mom. I think they’re dumb because of their lack of logic most of the time they have this “it is what it is” mentality and want me to go along with what illogical beliefs or ideas. Super frustrating**

i quit my job bc i couldn't stand the high social demands.

what job was it, what were the social demands and in what way were they too much?

**Call center. All of it. I don't want to talk to ppl, look at ppl, interact in anyway for a full time job. Pure torture. Having to smile and act polite and adhere to social norms around coworkers. There was a ton of cliques and gossip. People talking about their kids etc. i don't want to fucking sit their and smile pretending to enjoy small talk and have ppl wanting to relate by talking about kids, drinking, and dating. I don't care about those things i want to yell i don't give a fuck about your ex girlfriends husbands mother. Leave me alone!**

music

listening? Or creating? What do you enjoy about it?

**Both**

just meeting my goals and having a self full-filling life

What are your goals? What is a self-fulfilling life? What are you currently doing to achieve those goals?

**Working on my music to make it a career**

Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

NO

Why? What positions do you usually take in a group? How do you get along with the ""leader"" of a group?

**I just pretend to be happy and smile and am usually the writer of the group and organize everyones thoughts down. If no one wants to lead then the group sits in silent while i write down the answers then someone reads them to the class if needed.**

What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

i just want to make music

How often do you think of the past? How do you feel when doing so? How do you deal with guilt or regret? How nostalgic are you?

**I haaate discussing the past. I feel annoyed when ppl bring up their memories i don't effing care yet pretend to smile and nod. I have ptsd so deal with it by meditating and doing grounding techniques. Nostalgic for music and i guess the past is fine to explore if its to gain wisdom for the future but i don't want to sit and think about it for funsies.** 

How easy is it for you to ""live in the moment""?

**I am almost never in the moment my mind wanders elsewhere** 

How do you plan for the future?

**By sticking to my goals I have a 40 yr plan**

If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

**If I helped someone it would be bc i felt obligated too and probably bc it was on something interesting to me and if I help them then they can grow. Not that i would help ppl I am not the person to go to for help.**

You didn't answer that question

How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

very if I am interested idgaf if its something i don't like

**If I am passionate about what I am working on then I will work on it in the most efficient systematic way I possibly can. If I am not passionate I grow closer to half ass-ing it.**

Can you elaborate more on that?

I just hate human interaction so much

**Humans generally have different interests and desires from myself and I feel forced to lie about my life bc my interests are very out there from the norm. Music is the thing that I feel more connected in with humanity but the rest of my interests and things are not easy for me to connect to social norms. But yes I hate human interaction overall I hate ppl talking to me I wish they would leave me alone.**

How exactly do you feel about social interaction? Does it make you tired? anxious? stressed? bored? How do you feel when socializing for a few hours

**Depends but all negative things. Makes me feel bored, tired, anxious, stressed, angry. After a few hours I want to retreat to my house. I quit my job a few days ago because being around ppl that long makes me want to die. I felt my mental health decline fast. Now that I am alone again I am starting to feel better.**"
