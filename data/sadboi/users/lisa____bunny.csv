TaylorSwift,fg7g2r0,t1_fg314ku,1580591642.0,Agreed! I struggled to listen to the song previously but now it’s much less cringey and I can hear the joy in the lyrics now after getting a glimpse of the creative process behind the song

bubbletea,f2uniui,t3_d7p7wa,1570421714.0,"Places I’ve successfully used my resusable bubble tea cup (which is basically just a lidded jar i found in an op shop!)

- Cha Time
- ShareTea
- No Fail (Sydney)
- HereTea (Brisbane)

I haven’t had any issues to be honest, and always make sure to have a clean cup out of respect for the shop? I even have a little canvas carry bag for my jar so my hand doesn’t get cold :)

Edit: Gong Cha accepted my jar tonight!"
depression,f0chwgt,t3_cwl19g,1568540639.0,"I work in healthcare, and part of my job is to inform people that they have terminal cancer, or that their loved one’s haemorrhage is so severe that nothing we do will bring them back.

To be honest, I envy them.

To be able to have terminal stage 4 cancer and be in the position to refuse treatment for it and start fading out would be a godsend right now.

I totally get where you are coming from."

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,ey8g1qf,t3_ctt17y,1566919264.0,Completely random- where do you get your milk from in Melbourne (in the returnable glass bottles)?  :)
TaylorSwift,exsoqgw,t3_cu0nzl,1566551892.0,Does anyone have a list of the songs and artists from the her love song playlist? Now the album has dropped the Spotify play list has been replaced with album tracks and I didn’t save the original playlist :(
AusSkincare,evem9wk,t1_ev97xio,1564471249.0,Thank you I’ll take a look :)

After doing some reading/ speaking with some people, here are some things I’m looking to try with swimming in the pool:

- An occlusive: sorbolene/ Vaseline/ paw paw ointment prior to getting in. Basically to “water proof” the face and minimise the chlorine contact with skin

- rinsing face with fresh water as soon as possible, and proper cleansing once I get home

- using vitamin C serum that evening and following morning- apparently vitamin C neutralises chlorine !"
MakeupRehab,et24o13,t3_c8aqgm,1562410940.0,"I’ve been doing the “yoga skin “ method for a light, dewy base:

- a few drops of foundation
- drop of facial oil
- drop of liquid highlighter

I mix it on the back of my hand and and pat light layers over my face and finish with concealer.

I don’t really wear foundation any more (after I started focusing on skin care rather than make up my skin really cleared up!), but want to use it up so it doesn’t go to waste!

You can also mix with a little bit of sunscreen and face moisturiser and liquid colour corrector to diy a Bb cream, and “Pat/ tamp” it onto your skin with a damp sponge- to mimic a Bb cushion effect :)"
MakeupRehab,ereeew0,t1_erdl9i2,1560781973.0,So so true! Now I obsess over serums as opposed to lipsticks :)
