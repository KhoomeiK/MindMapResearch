My first 4 meals were nachos + crunchy taco. The soft taco shells went stale in 2-3 days. I reheated the chips and crunchy shells in the air fryer and they were always great. My lettuce actually lasted the entire week, but I use a lot of lettuce on my nachos so went through it pretty fast. I still have most of the container of shredded cheese left, it's a lot!

All in all, the things I ended up throwing out: most of the soft shells, half the crunchy shells, 1 container of lettuce, a taco's worth of meat. I just couldn't finish it all myself before the week was over and didn't feel like risking week old Taco Bell meat haha!"

I bought a yellow lite because it fits in my bag much better, weighs less on my back (once you add the weight of a grip that is necessary to play handheld without pain it's heavier than my chromebook), and feels much more comfortable to hold (I have smaller hands). Also now I don't feel like I'm denying my husband game time when I bring the switch to work (he gets home much earlier than me). It being the size of my wallet is pretty awesome! 

A lot of people seem to have issue with being able to play digital games with it being a secondary console but I just use pdanet to make my phone a wifi Hotspot for a minute to allow verification which solved that problem while allowing my husband to still play our main switch at home.

GirlGamers,ewbzbs3,t3_cnjfj4,1565274689.0,"Sorry you had such a bad experience in WoW! I've been playing off and on for 10 years or so and I've had many positive and some negative experiences, but I'd say mostly positive. I usually find a good group to play with without much effort. It could depend on where/when you're playing too, as different servers have different vibes and I think generally Horde is a bit more chill than Alliance I've heard?

Trade chat is always a cesspool, I turn it off unless I'm actually trading. In most games I've played, if there's any sort of global chat it's just a mess of politics and inflammatory comments meant to get a rise out of people. Basically, that's where the trolls live. I just ignore/block the worst of them so that when I actually want to use the chat for its intended purpose I don't have to sift through their blabber.

I have definitely run into people who poop on other people and bring them down, but I just ignore them and move on. One thing I love about gaming is it's very easy to remove myself from a situation I don't like, or to remove other people from being able to contact me. 

Anyways, I hope you have better luck in the future! WoW Classic is coming out soon and I think it will be a bit more mature and hopefully more chill than retail, so you can always give that another go if you'd like."

Deny them that, and they go away. It's not like in real like where they can be a legitimate threat you can't ignore.

sewing,etyr4wg,t3_ce5665,1563321564.0,After much deliberation (and totally getting upsold at the dealer) I ended up with a Baby Lock Jubilant for $400! I made this drawstring bag as my first ever project! I made the bias tape myself. It is pretty rough but after 3 hours I was tired of ripping out seams and resewing them so I decided close enough!
sewing,etw05ha,t1_etvxu31,1563249570.0,"Janome seems more affordable, or rather they have more machines that are cheaper, but is there a drop in quality? They seem to just sell via Amazon for half the price of their website's listed MSRP so wouldn't buying from a dealership be a bad idea if they sell at MSRP?
Also the most similar machine to the Baby Lock Zeal seems to be the Sewist 725S which is $100 more expensive for the same features.

I feel like Janome has a lot of cheaper ""box store"" models like Brother and that's what I'm trying to avoid since they seem to almost all have universal insides. They have many computerized models under $300 even and if that's not ""worth it"" then I feel like they're definitely diluting their reputation kind of like Brother's low end stuff. Baby Lock doesn't have any computerized ones under $500 so I feel like at least they aren't pumping out lower quality computerized models like you warn against."

The benefit from the dealership would be the warranty since buying stuff from Amazon wouldn't have any of that I'd assume.

I've only heard good things about baby lock and they're less pricey than pfaff and Bernina which are too expensive for me to either buy or maintain.

I've narrowed down my choices to this:

\* Baby lock zeal from dealership $350 (a bit high imo) - comes with 25y parts warranty, 1 yr free labor, and 20% off what you buy in the store forever (don't know how useful this will be)

\* Baby lock quilter's choice from Craigslist $300 - looks well taken care of, last serviced in 2017 and used twice a year since then

\* Baby lock Sofia from Facebook $225 - doesn't come with the extension table, hasn't been used much recently

I've read that computerized sewing machines have neater stitches but I'm worried about the maintenance costs on them since I know they're higher. 


Any opinions on which option is the best?"

I've just become interested in sewing and am looking for my first machine. I bought an $80 brother from Amazon to make a pouch (my first time sewing anything lol) and I had a lot of fun but want to return it for something that's built a little better.

I haven't quite decided if mechanical or computerized is better for me. It sounds like mechanical will be cheaper to maintain but some features seem to make things a lot easier on a computerized machine. Here are some options I've been looking at (most on Craigslist or Facebook):

\* Baby lock Sofia, used $225

\* Baby lock Rachel, used $300

\* Bernina activa 220, used $300

\* Bernina 1010, used $350

\* Janome 2212, new $190

\* Baby lock quilters dream, used $350

\* Baby lock zeal, floor model from dealer $350

  


Does anyone have any opinions or guidance really on what I should be leaning toward? I want to mostly sew crafts like bags but with the ability to start doing clothes and quilts if I feel so inclined. It would be cute to embroider bags but not at the expense of good stitches.

One thing I'm worried about with used computerized machines is the lifetime of the electronics - I hear they are really expensive to replace and repair.

Anyways, thank you for any and all help you're willing to give!"

sewing,etp42e5,t3_ca67j5,1563045162.0,"Do you guys think the Brother cs6000i is worth the extra $50 over the xm2701? I am a complete beginner who mainly plans on sewing tears in clothing, hemming pants, and making simple things like pouches or bags. Probably not clothes anytime soon as that's rather intimidating haha!"
sewing,etlqy4b,t1_esjr9yl,1562943324.0,Hey I know yours just stopped working after 3 years but I just purchased a similar $80 Brother machine (xm 2701) and was wondering how you liked yours during the 3 years? I'm just starting out so I'm hoping for the price it's a decent beginner machine!
GirlGamers,esywz4m,t1_esyr5aw,1562351164.0,Aww man I loved Morgana. I didn't really think he was creepy although I thought he was a female cat for a long time lol.
crochet,esehhsc,t3_bzvvc6,1561899011.0,Hi what kind of yarn is that?
crochet,esd1lfr,t1_esd0f20,1561844638.0,"Thanks for the honesty haha! I've been crocheting around 2 years now so I think I might be able to figure it out. I think maybe something small like that fluffy sea bunny might be a good start and great idea putting stitch markers in every stitch to start with.

Thank you very much I love your shop!!"
crochet,esczsya,t1_escxqyc,1561843278.0,Omg those are all too cute!! Question - how difficult is it to crochet with that fluffy yarn? I've been trying to make a fluffy bunny with similar yarn and I'm having a lot of trouble!
crochet,escv9tz,t3_c71kdm,1561839823.0,What a cute lil guy I love it! Did you use a pattern?
