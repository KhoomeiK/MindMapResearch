HealthAnxiety,fr0vqzd,t3_glzo2l,1589807871.0,Yeah today I feel like my whole body is so weak and I‚Äôm proper fatigued and dizzy and wobbly. Horrible feeling
HealthAnxiety,fqynpld,t1_fqy7lce,1589751564.0,Yes a little bit
HealthAnxiety,fqy1zeg,t3_glf189,1589741290.0, I‚Äôm no doctor but could be vasovagal syncope. I have experienced this where you sweat real bad and pass out quite suddenly. It‚Äôs usually triggered by fear or something like that. Like vasovagal syncope is what causes people to faint at the sight of blood. Obviously ask yourself doc about what it could have been but just a suggestion as to what it could be ^^
HealthAnxiety,fqy1f6u,t3_glfv5j,1589741036.0,YES my doc told me this this week. I have had this lymph node here for about 5 weeks now and I keep touching it multiple times a day and I‚Äôve had no sign of infection that would bring up a lymph node. He told me not to touch It at all for about a week because apparently touching it promotes swelling of the lymph node
HealthAnxiety,fqy10v5,t3_gljps6,1589740862.0,Yes I get this exact thing

HealthAnxiety,fqhifjz,t1_fqdme6e,1589377642.0,Yep. The doc said give it another week. Probably caused by a skin infection and stress :)
HealthAnxiety,fqdjfi7,t1_fqcbggi,1589290956.0,"Yeah I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs nothing to worry about, though I see it reported as an anxiety symptom a lot so it should be okay fingers crossed ü§û"

HealthAnxiety,fq12c1t,t3_ggdcec,1589040815.0,"Yes I get them electric shocks. Sometimes it can signal low levels or serotonin in the brain so maybe if you also suffer with depression that might have a little bit to do with it. Also numb legs I get, it could be tension, or maybe lack of moving around? Try walking it off maybe. It could also be purely psychological and your legs are not actually weak, you‚Äôre just perceiving them to be that way. 

I worry about Ms too but with no family history of Ms it‚Äôs very unlikely that you have it, and even if you do it‚Äôs not that bad of news compared to what it was 20 years ago. Medicine and treatments for Ms have come far and will continue to do so, so within another 20 years it could be much more manageable. 

Definitely speak to a doctor or neuro anyway and maybe get their opinion or look at getting an MRI of the head and neck to diagnose it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine though, your chances we very low."
HealthAnxiety,fpztdbe,t3_ggctb0,1589023332.0,"Yes this is a new one for me too, it seems more severe from my waist down, it‚Äôs like my legs are pulsating really fast but it‚Äôs not in time with my heart so I know it can‚Äôt be related to that. Scary feeling I know"

I‚Äôm either thinking I‚Äôm gonna die of a heart attack today or my heart failing. I‚Äôm obsessively monitoring my HR and the colour of my hands and feet to check my blood is circulating okay. It‚Äôs tough it honestly is. I just want a break :("

HealthAnxiety,fn0lghp,t1_fn0l1sv,1586544119.0,"I think I got adjusted to taking it at my neck because you can feel the difference of when your blood pressure is high and when it‚Äôs normal depending on how hard the artery is pulsating, but when you take it at the wrist you can‚Äôt tell. 

I am trying to take it at the wrist but sometimes I‚Äôll just take it at my neck so unconsciously and it seems like a habit I can‚Äôt break. And I did consider a Fitbit but I thought since that‚Äôs like a constant monitor, I would obsess even more since then I can very easily see my heart rate and I don‚Äôt even have to think about taking my pulse myself. 

I‚Äôll definitely try taking it at the wrist more at the moment, but it just feels hard to break the habit"

My whole face and upper half and everywhere had pins and needles and I couldn‚Äôt breathe with the chest pain. I called up the doctor and they told me to take some aspirin and sent an ambulance for me. I was CONVINCED it was a heart issue.

Turns out it wasn‚Äôt. It was sheer panic. The ambulance team did all my vitals and an ECG and everything that would show any sign of an issue, and everything was perfect. Anxiety and stress and panic can do insane things to you, I find it hard to believe that I‚Äôm just anxious all the time when I‚Äôm feeling all these symptoms. It‚Äôs hard I know, I‚Äôve even had a panic attack today already about me feeling dizzy. 

Maybe contact your doctor or a medical professional just to get their opinion, or take some aspirin to see if it eases it at all. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre okay though.

selfharm,fmsn32j,t3_fx4291,1586358637.0,"Yeah it‚Äôs not a good idea. The point of blood thinners is to stop your blood clotting, and your blood clotting is very important to stop cuts bleeding, especially deeper ones. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this at all because you could end up with a nasty bleed that won‚Äôt stop because your blood cannot clot easily. If you do do it however since we can‚Äôt exactly stop you, if there‚Äôs a cut that is struggling to stop bleeding then use some cloth or a towel and apply pressure for 5-10 minutes and that should help lessen the bleeding.
