There’s no fluid involved in the noise your knuckle makes, it’s harmless long term unless you abuse your joints and compulsively pop them relentlessly for minutes at a time. Then you cause mechanical wear of your joints and this leads to pain. This is all assuming you have no underlying conditions that affect your joints, I have hyper flexible tendons which is actually what makes all the noise in the video, it’s the tendons whipping over the knuckle and making noise.

Slicer software: People will say Cura because it’s free, and that’s fine, but I hate how unreliable it is to get a copy to work for you. I was not one of the lucky 17 people online who swear up and down that it’s not slow, their profiles aren’t deleted when updating, and managing the printer settings doesn’t take hours to do. BUT it is free. I personally paid for Simplify3D, it’s great, it’s expensive. Filament is a bit like fuel for your automobile, the cheap stuff will still get you there just not as fast. Or the first time. Filament is YOUR responsibility to research, since what you want to make will dictate what you should use. PLA is what you can start with since it prints inexpensively and at low temperatures so you aren’t waiting 10 minutes for the printer to heat up just to make something simple. Quality of filament won’t matter for a few weeks, you probably won’t be making tolerance adjustments in the hundreds of thousands of millimeters until you understand clearance of force fitting parts. The software you use to 3D model will make the largest impact on the speed of your printing, Inventor 2020 is free with a student email per their website and is in my opinion the simplest way to learn. Fusion 360 is unnecessarily difficult to learn on for a first time user that isn’t accustomed to the environment and file formats. Both softwares work and can export to .stl which is what you need in order to make g-code, the code a 3D printer reads in order to move around and lay down plastic."
