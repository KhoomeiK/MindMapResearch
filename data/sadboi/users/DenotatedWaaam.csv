depression,fcyjljh,t1_fcxv76l,1578081158.0,"Sometimes I think about intrusive thoughts like YouTube hate comments. YouTubers take them really personally and seriously at first, but after awhile they are able to kind of drown them out because they become irrelevant and unproductive."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fc4inya,t3_eg5lc4,1577417769.0,I laughed
PewdiepieSubmissions,fc4igj1,t3_eg5o53,1577417598.0,"Guys this is real I can confirm, was there."
depression,fc4dmwk,t3_eg4cgf,1577413623.0,"Get the shotgun out of your house and give it to someone you trust to keep away from you if you can find the strength to do it. I believe if you. Please don’t kill yourself. You’re worth having around on the earth, whoever you are. Truly."
depression,fc4deaf,t1_fc4dbv2,1577413426.0,"And like...even if you could break the glass, would you really want to when all it brings is a wave of misery?"
depression,fc4dbv2,t3_eg4dx6,1577413371.0,It’s like everyone else is on the other side of the glass and I’m just watching them live without being able to break the glass and get help
depression,fc4d5vb,t3_eg4kja,1577413234.0,Idk either. But I know whoever you are your life is worth another shot before you give it up. Praying for you in whatever situation ur in.
depression,fc4d0wd,t3_eg4nmi,1577413125.0,I’m glad that there’s a community. It can make me feel just a little bit less alone
depression,fbmg0b1,t3_edz55u,1576983198.0,I think I’m getting worse too...I thought I was getting better but I don’t know what to think about my mental heath anymore. It’s so unpredictable.
depression,fbfq6v5,t1_fbfq1ff,1576817370.0,"And when you get something done you can feel proud of it. Even if you got the task done out of self hatred, you can appreciate yourself and your motivation to do it. It makes me feel a hell of a lot better I know that much."
depression,fbfq1ff,t3_ed55mt,1576817240.0,"Sometimes I force myself to do things out of hatred of myself. Like smiling and talking to people and submitting assignments on time. I make myself just suck it up and do it because I convince myself that I’m just bitching anyway. I try not to let depression be an excuse, and I just beat myself up until I get something done. It’s not very healthy but I have noticed that I’ve been starting to do things that don’t stem from self hatred. Once you start doing things instead of just thinking about them and dreading them you’ll have more time away from your thoughts and more time to not hate yourself"
depression,fbfpp24,t3_ed55ea,1576816945.0,Maybe reach out to someone you trust if you have someone? If not than try to talk to a therapist. It feels pretty shitty but it makes you feel less isolated and more like a human. I hope you feel better and don’t kill your self.
depression,fbfpckr,t3_ed43i2,1576816649.0,Yeah definitely
depression,fbfp9o4,t3_ecypox,1576816579.0,"Ahh yeah I don’t have any advice to give because I can’t think, but this is what my brain has also come too at this point."
depression,fbfovid,t3_ed43i2,1576816252.0,Yeah I do this I made pies from scratch today. It helps to take my mind off of wanting to kill myself.
depression,fbfospg,t3_ecuzbu,1576816187.0,Honestly. It’s like I’m sorry I’m not producing as much as you are I’m fucking trying my hardest to get out of bed.
depression,fbfoimp,t3_ed1qpm,1576815957.0,Fuck them. Happy birthday from the other fucking lonely ass people.
depression,fb6qe7x,t3_ebqmk9,1576557028.0,I’m sorry. That sucks :/

depression,f9o9ijk,t1_f9njo78,1575499374.0,Well you can message me if you feel like you need a stranger to vent to. :)
depression,f9nd7sy,t3_e60mbo,1575482102.0,"I feel the same way. But weather I feel like killing myself or feel fine, it’s like I’m not actually feeling anything at all...if that makes sense."
offmychest,f9lvgfp,t3_e5fd5d,1575433099.0,"I just started going to therapy a month or so ago and it’s actually been helping quite a bit. I was super nervous, but if you have a good therapist they should be super easy to talk to and not judgemental."
