I had it one year and the irrigation broke and I didn’t notice but that stuff lived and thrived even throughout 117 degrees and no water. And the flavor wasn’t impacted at all. 

Also my kale does great during the summer. It gets bitter but I don’t mind and I also notice the bitterness goes away if you choose to cook it, or make kale chips which is what I always do. This year I decided to do traditional lettuces inside, mostly to save money and reduce trips to the grocery store. 

I try to grow as much stuff as I can. As many different things. To see what I like and why grows well. I’ve only been gardening here for 3 years so over that time there’s been stuff I’d never grow again and stuff I’ll make sure to grow every year no matter what. 

Eggplant does well and I have had no pest problems, except one time beetles were eating it but the plant was so vigorous I didn’t even care, it was almost nice to have a natural pruning. 

I’m doing amaranth for the first tine this year, and okra and a few other things

Every year I grow the muncher cucumber. It’s my favorite.

For lacewings, Try some sunflowers. They grow exceptionally well here. And of course they’re beautiful. The lacewings are all hanging out and hiding in the petals. Also they seem to hang out in dried up leaves on dying plants and my lettuce that went to seed.

vegetablegardening,fpunmvn,t1_fpuapr6,1588917870.0,"Hey I’m in Phoenix and I have been struggling with the same thing. The good news is, if you reeeaaallly baby it, eventually they kind of grow out of it. I think it’s due to some really aggressive white flies we have here. I used a combination of neem oil spray and yellow sticky traps I found on amazon. I made a post about it not that long ago, if you look at my post history. My cucumber plants still look very ragged, exactly like yours, but they’re getting more established and growing better every day. I’ve even gotten 3 cucumbers (out of my ~8 plants....) The thing is, once the plant starts to really fight back and put on some good flowers, you want to stop with the neem oil or else bees don’t visit the plant. Also, if you’re lucky, your beneficial insects will show up soon and help you out. Mine have been lacewings (light green bug, small with long narrow transparent wings. Google image it) Helps to attract them if you have lots of flowers in your garden too. 

So basically I used the sticky traps, and sprayed neem oil solution on them every day for about two weeks, then slowly tapered off the neem oil. It’s been about 4-6 weeks since I planted them and they’re just now producing fruit. Definitely a huge bummer because I love cucumbers and I wanted to try to make pickles this year. I should have had buckets of cucumbers a long time ago but this definitely stunted them. Whatever it is. 

I was excited to see this because I have the same problem and have been fighting it. And to see we are in somewhat of the same region was no surprise.

Also the reason you want to do the neem oil every day is because, as I have read, in our area it doesn’t actually kill the white flies but it does kill their eggs. 

I hope this is helpful to you. I know how frustrating this is, it’s been very frustrating for me too. 

Oh also, are yours outside yet or no? Since my plants did better once they got bigger, next year I plan on keeping them inside waaaay longer before I put them outside so they have a better chance."

In the abstract, a good morning text seems normal.. but I don’t think it makes sense in context. It’s like “hey I was thinking about you first thing in the morning. Let’s have an ongoing dialogue all day.”
