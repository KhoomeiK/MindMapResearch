TBI,foboeex,t1_foba284,1587661919.0,"Great, glad you have your mom and dad to help! Oh and I wanted to mention, I’d hold off on any sports until you rehab your concussion. Every time you get a concussion, your risk of getting another one goes up by a lot. Getting back to back concussions is quite dangerous. 

I think you could find other sports that light that fire inside that aren’t contact - maybe even just intense workout programs. 

You should consider watching this movie. It gives a great view of how serious this can be. You should be able to watch it online, but the trailer is here: http://www.kevinpearce.com/documentary.html"
TBI,fo9ilnm,t3_g6gcud,1587620569.0,"I have post concussion syndrome and just know that it isn’t too late to heal (especially because you’re young).

I’m happy to help search if you feel comfortable sharing your location! 

Otherwise, a neurologist should be able to refer you to various rehab programs (speech, vestibular,etc.) 

Regarding sports, I’d highly suggest you stop doing any contact sports. What about running track or joining the swim team? You do not want to put yourself at risk for further head injuries or CTE. If you were my kid, I definitely would pull you out of contact sports. 8 concussions by 14 is a lot, please protect your brain!"
