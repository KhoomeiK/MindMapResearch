Least Roanoke because it felt too gimmicky"
AmericanHorrorStory,f2961pg,t3_dcmgsx,1570082237.0," Coven-the witches are iconic and the humor so twisted and dark. It has my favorite character In the whole anthology series Fiona Goode!

Asylum- truly terrifying and again Jessica Lange is the best, but I really loved all the female rolls from Pepper to the Mother Superior. 

Hotel-felt original and introduced me to H. h. Holmes in real life. Also I am fascinated with Elisa Lam death!!!The character Liz Taylor is also in my top 10 🖤

Freakshow-Dandy Mott!!! Elsa Mars and the backstory from Asylum connection! plus more PEPPER!!!

Murder House- was solid and had a good ghost twist 

Cult-felt timely and scary,almost too real; you can’t trust anyone. Those freaking killer clowns 🤡However I didn’t really care about anyone in the show. 
 
Apocalypse-was not what I expected in any way shape or form, even the witches were out of place and Murder House. Hmmm kinda of a disappointment. 

Roanoke-it was just ok and confusing however I really did enjoy Kathy Bates having a breakdown on sunset boulevard🤣"
