I do cancer cell genotyping, Full RAS, EGFR, BRCA, the works, gyno diagnostics like HPV and some paternity testing.

wowservers,esw37zx,t3_c98io6,1562308512.0,"You're welcome to come play with me and my friends on Netherwing (TBC), we're just starting out and I'm guiding them through the process, an extra person is always welcome ^^

TBC is a bit different from the other expansions since the RPG elements of the game are still intact making the game a bit harder than the other xpacs meaning you have to be aware of threat, use crowd control abilities and try your best to itemize correctly. Build diversity also leaves little wiggle room if you want to do endgame group content. You can play however it appeals to you most but if you want to get into endgame raiding you'll have to sacrifice some of that freedom for the sake of optimization  and depending on your class and personal preferences that may result in varying degrees of fun for the sake of gear/content progression. 

That being said, TBC is VERY group oriented and the game itself facilitates building communities unlike current wow that encourages solo play. If needed I can rave on about WotLK or other expansions to help you make a decision ^^"
