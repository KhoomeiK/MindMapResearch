AskEurope,fqsycld,t3_gk57mk,1589623416.0,"Finnish words can be weird, but I've like always wondered why we say *appelsiini* when almost everybody has 'orange' (which by the way became the name of the color orange which in Finnish is *oranssi*). *Appel* points to an apple, *omena* in our language. I think I read (or made up it myself!) some bogus story about mixed containers or something. Today I looked it up from Wiktionary and it's a German loan from *Apfelsine* (and Swedish *apelsin*) (and apparently the German word comes from 'China apple' (*pomme de Chine*)! What kills me a bit, is that I've learned both Swedish and German and *never* realised that *appelsiini* is an obvious loan from there. When studying, I've must have been like 'this is easy word *appelsiini* goes brrrr in the mixer' and not connected at all to my shower thought about the etymology of the word"
AskEurope,fqswnlo,t1_fqp219v,1589621577.0,"In Finnish, we have *peruna*, which comes from Swedish *päron* (pear) och *jordpäron* (earth-pear), which apparently are translated from German *Erdbirne* (= earth-pear). In old dialects potato is sometimes called *maaomena* (*maa*=earth, *omena=*apple)."

BPD,fqj7dn6,t3_giltnk,1589406051.0,"well it's good it's been discussed. i read this yesterday and didn't know what to say. i've been slowly coming to terms how abusive my actions have been lately. i'm still in denial like the 'don't blame others from you shitty decisions, you know what i am' (i don't even believe some 'shitty' life decions should determine anything!)

and it's not like i've started this now, i've been a shitty person for all of my life. i can pinpoint some reasons now and know also i take some things more seriously than other people and then some not. 

it sounds so hard, but it's true. but i'd like to add, we bdp's usually beat ourselves with being bad somehow. we should really learn to different  the bad things that happened to us and try to heal from them. and that we're living our lives and doing mistakes like any other living being, dealing with them."
BPD,fqir47x,t3_giwbxj,1589399742.0,"My life is a train wreck and I cannot cope with 'real life'. However, usually in the times of crisis I can be the rational one and even 'the leader' sometimes. Even in my own life crisis before it got really bad. Never really been in bad accidents or things like that tho and always thought I never know how I would handle the situation.

There are reasons, they say that when you are used to chaos or always think of the chaos, I think it's just that other people may have got so used to their rutines or never really see the world as cruel as it can be. Or maybe, when there's no time or chance to question your everything in oblivion, I can do it, harf harf.

What kills me now, I thought I could handle this covid thing good. Not dared to think I've made for chaos but like, I can do this good since I've kinda used to be at home etc. Well I'm in scrambles now. I know it has been a long time and in my country it's been a easy one, and I can not understand the stupidity in ...some other countries, or how abusive leaders can just keep doing what they're doing. But I know now I can't cope the bad times too and it's really rough."

BPD,fq8yvsq,t3_ghh9ky,1589179758.0,"This is one of the worst things about bpd. It doesn't help that people have accused me of faking things, since I can be very down in one moment and half and hour later just the happiest person on the planet. I've learned that one can have many different conditions at once, but surely not that many that I'm maybe having (neuroatypical, bpd, cptsd, narcolepsy??, cronic depression, anxiety, bipolar??). Often if I try to describe my symptoms or feelings, it might be ""well it's like this but then in someway not at all"". I don't want to talk about it anymore, I feel like everyone are just eye rolling and I'm just making excuses why I am like this. 

Idk if this helps, but try to think your symptoms, feelings, emotions are valid and happening to *you*. Maybe there's no 'sense' about them, but you have to let them be to really examine them and find out what they're about. I'm so empty right now, I can't find better words."

Finland,fhj8ng1,t3_f37y1x,1581640255.0,"Oh this reminded me of my own funny story and I just have to tell it now although full natives. My dear mother was not vestal at all but her swearing was pretty mild: *pakana* (heathen), *hitto* (heck), most bad maybe *paska* (shit) and *helevetti* (dialectal *helvetti*, hell). 

One bright frosty winterday we went to the town to buy groseries etc, a weekly rural thing. We went to get gasoline too together with my mom, I was driving since she had no license. We took some to a canister too, I had the pistol and she was assuring it would not tip since just could not wait in the car. It was really really cold that day though and I had problems with the pistol, my hands all frozen. I started to laugh and she was irritated, maybe very cold too, grunting I should stop fuzzling and start to be serious. And then I pushed the pistol, shooting petrol almost to her hands, she startled, went up, stamped once like a toddler in her town clothes and yelled ""VITTU!!!!"" I was bamboozled then started to laugh almost uncontrollably but somehow we went along. I am snorting even now as I type since it was really funny somehow, hope you find it funny too!"

But when depressed or too much in my head I can't. First steps of healing from there are random cries or crying all the time, even not having sad thoughts.

Like true splitter, I can be very 'tought' too. Sometimes when others are crying or there's a crisis I can be very composed to the point others have find it odd."

BPD,fhdupql,t3_ewu3ya,1581502633.0,"To be honest, no. I've almost always had a cat, some rats and gerbils and taken care of dogs. I mean, definitely they can help many ways like other people have described: I have to take care of someone, someone trusts me and loves me (and with cats there's the soothing healing purring!). But if you're wired all wrong like me that can be a burden too.

When I feel ""that ol' emptiness feelin'"", sometimes it feels double as bad that there is that 'stupid' creature who is depended of me and stupidly trusts me. That stares me lovingly and don't understand what kind of piece of shit I am. Poor thing. Or maybe they understand, I'm so ashamed and sorry I'm ruining their life too... These kind of disturbed thoughts starting to spiral. And even with a very lovingly rat I've had these weird intimacy problems :D But then I've been very happy I can't shut them completely out, i.e. I have to let a cat in my lap, to be close. I have financial problems now and they are a factor too. Taking care of an animal is not cheap. The worst was when my beloved cat had suddenly cancer, I wouldn't have had money to take care of it, but ""luckily"" (I guess) it was so aggressive tumor there was nothing to do about it. I had to borrow money for an euthanasia and cremation and it felt terrible. (and losing a pet is very very painfull of course)

I'm sorry about this long scrappy answer but I try to be honest. The best is maybe to start by taking care of someone elses cat or dog for a while.  And always adopt no shop. I'm a woman btw but very nonbinary and my motherly instinct is strong but not ""traditional"".
