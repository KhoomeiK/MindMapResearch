Semen leaves the body eventually anyway although generally people in multiple relationships use condoms. And 2.

Some people believe that monogamy is not natural. And any arguments I've heard against polyamory are based in jealousy and and insecurity and I don't know why you would defend either emotion. What's wrong with your girlfriend having sex? Why do you have to own eachother? Cause to me that sounds unhealthy.

I just weaned off gradually because I either couldn't get my hands on it or was too sick because of my own health. With the nicotine however, I quit cold turkey when I decided I wanted my gf to quit.
