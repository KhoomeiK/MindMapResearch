notmycat,fkm1mu0,t1_fkm0pye,1584319222.0,That's sweet. Our house is basically a cat magnet. Our Tuxedo randomly came to our house one night nearly starved to death. He was skin and bones. We assumed that someone found him and dropped him off at our neighborhood. We fed him and he hasn't left since. Now he gets a lot of food and cuddles and is one of the happiest chokers that we could ask for. The other the gray kitty came to our house a few months ago. He was scared and would run off everytime you get close to him to feed him. Eventually he got used to us and one day let us pet him. The tabby kitty came to our house just a few days ago. He's super friendly and doesn't seem to mind human interaction. Obviously once we gave those two food they decided to make themselves at home almost immediately. We don't mind though.

AskReddit,eyu8svl,t3_cyrgcx,1567455843.0,"With depression, we're notbeing lazy. It's about not being able to feel any emotion, or you feel everything all at once. People may ask you whats wrong, but you don't even know. You lose intrest in things that you used to enjoy, which causes you to lack the motivation to do anything. You become isolated because you don't want to socialize with anyone around you. You pretend to be okay when in reality you're not okay. You don't want people to see your pain.

With Psychosis, we're not considered crazy. You show signs of paranoia and delusions. You believe everyone is out to get you or cause harm to you in some way. You belive that everyone is looking at you and talking bad about you behind your back. You don't communicate with people because you don't trust them enough. You isolate yourself because the only person you trust is yourself. Even then you start to believe things about yourself that's others disagree with."
