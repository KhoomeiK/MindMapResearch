Plus he and Edie knew each other from a very young age so it's impossible that he's semi-immortal and was just assigned to Edie when she was born. He could have worked for them, or perhaps they were very influential to house Vestra, but I believe that if that's true, he fell in love (for want of a better word) with Edie and devoted himself to her from then on. It doesn't explain why Edie felt the need to go to war with the church- that still feels odd to me. Bur perhaps she made that motivation clear and Hubert proposed that working with the Agarthians was the only way to win that battle. Plus it provided him a way of learning more about their technology and powers.

Have Dany rescue everyone else but be unable to rescue him, wounding the Night King would make him dying by Ayra's hand make more sense, and would give us a better idea of his weaknesses and strengths before he suddenly dies. Maybe have Drogon attempt to light him on fire DURING this battle, drop the bombshell that he's invulnerable to Dragon fire here, and leave everyone with the question of how he can even be killed for a season- until Arya notices something that Jon did with Longclaw, perhaps a shallow wound in his chest- and uses that as the perfect point to stab him. Better yet, feint like she's going for the head and then use that dagger drop move she did with the implication that it was her plan all along. It would feel like a more deserved victory. 

Plus that would count as Jon fulfilling the prophecy, he would be instrumental in brining down the NK- just not right away. Then give his sad, passive Season 8 plot arc to Jorah- someone it would actually fit perfectly. Someone who's unwavering loyalty to Dany has been an instrumental part of his character for almost the whole show, not just when they needed it. Having him make the heartbreaking decision to kill Dany at the end would actually have some emotional impact there."

Jeritza in particular needs a lot more in the way of supports, as he's one of the most interesting characters. Edelgard and Hubert should be able to support with him, for one- clearly him and Edie have a deep trust, and Hubert's curious and paranoid nature would naturally lead to him learning as much as he could about the Death Knight. I also think there's great potential for supports with Caspar, Felix, Lysithia, Yuri, and Hapi. Caspar as someone who developed a jealous rivalry with the Death Knight before finding himself allied with him. Felix, who sparred with Jeritza often and therefore got to know him in a more intimate way than most of the cast- not to mention the parallel Mercedes draws between the two. Both would be curious to find out how much they really have in common with Jeritza. Lysithia, would no doubt have questions that only Jeritza could answer regarding TWSITD.
