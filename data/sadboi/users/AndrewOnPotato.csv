You might've, cause this was posted 8 hours ago, but if you can still see this I strongly advise you not to do it, it's really not the solution imo. Most likely, death won't bring you the peace and comfort that you seek.

 Ceasing to exist will not relieve your pain, you will just make the last moments of your life miserable and everything that could've been, good or bad, every opportunity, any chance for things to get better, all of the potential within you will be gone in the blink of an  eye, just like that. No one's a winner in a situation like this. One suicide leads to the next and it keeps spiraling down and building up negativity. I don't want you to feel like I'm blaming you, I just want you to acknowledge that this disgusting illness that is depression is clouding your judgement, it's telling you that you don't matter and you're worthless when it may not be your case. I don't know your situation well enough to say whether you are actually loved by those around you, but what I do know and see clearly is how many people are telling you the opposite and encouraging you. If it won't affect anyone else, it will affect each and everyone of us that saw this post and make us feel like we weren't enough, like we could've done something more to pull you out of this.

Instead, make yourself your first priority, focus on YOUR OWN self-growth, rather than helping some leeches. I've been trying to do that and not to be affected too much by this kind of things for the last few months and I see some improvements, I can at least say that. I can also tell you it's not easy, there are days when all of this shit gets to me, when I feel down or angry, but it's worth it and I definitely don't regret this change.

I'm not out of this rabbit hole just yet, but I'm slowly getting there and at the very least I'm not self-loathing anymore. Having said this, I can assure you there is a way out of this agonizing state, and that is forgiving yourself (because self-hatred, even if it seems well-deserved, will only make things worse) and finding what motivates you to better yourself and holding on to it. I know very well it's not easy to do, but there's no other option and you're the only one who can do it, no one else can/will do it for you. I'm hopeful that all of you on this sub who feel this way will make it. I don't know you, but I'm convinced you'll be able to do it.
