>
> **In two large cohorts of patients with heart failure, plasma ACE2 concentrations were higher in men than in women, possibly reflecting higher tissue expression of this receptor for SARS coronavirus infections. This could explain why men might be more susceptible to infection with, or the consequences of, SARS-CoV-2.** Patients receiving ACE inhibitors or ARBs did not have higher plasma concentrations of ACE2, and any effect of MRAs was small and inconsistent, supporting the continued use of these agents in patients with heart failure during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

> The conclusions drawn in this analysis are mainly restricted to heart failure, albeit a group of patients at high risk for COVID-19. Secondly, **since our patients are not coronavirus infected, we cannot provide a direct link between the course of COVID-19 disease in patients with low vs. high plasma ACE2 concentrations, and the influence of age and RAAS blockers on the course of the disease.** Thirdly, we measured plasma ACE2 concentrations and not membrane-bound ACE2.

Anxiety,fq8u7yl,t3_gh1e24,1589175663.0,"Congratulations!

At the risk of sounding like a robot, anxiety is a fight-flight response and multiplication of fear by imagination. This appears to impair intellectual ability, because an animal being actively hunted (you) cannot be expected to remember the colour or smell of the grass or sky, nor can it (you) think straight when being hunted. However, this does not diminish any intelligence or skills you have, contrary to what chronic anxiety might lead you to believe.

This is the reason people with severe anxiety can also suddenly perform tasks that they consider impossible. None of your genetically obtained or training-acquired abilities are reduced or lost.

If anything fear keeps your whole system sharp. So when you are not being actively hunted, you can perform to your potential.

Agreed. Having been through this phase of anxiety myself, I religiously guarded my disorder in phases and made myself feel negatively special, singled out by the universe for suffering (""you guys have no idea"") whereas the fact is that there are indeed always a few 100 or 1000 people at least who have it much much worse than you. (Often the number is in millions, actually)

This was when I was high-functioning. When I got independent neurological issues which complicated everything 5x, I finally had to give up, just as you said with AA. Then I found this sub, read just 2-3 books (Dr. Claire Weekes & the OCD book) and watched a ton of videos by therapists and experts on youtube and now I feel I was an idiot to suffer all that while, when the cure was just a proper understanding of the disorder and implementing some thought practices for a few months. 75-80% of the weight of the disorder was lifted in just 2 months. I keep getting minor relapses, but just reading that all my symptoms and experiences are common and normal for the disorder, and the fact that it is a simple animal fight or flight response, not the complicated unforgiving monster I saw before, that is what did the trick."

Of course exercise and breathing exercises help. You have to do it daily but still. I struggled for years before I really committed to doing these things. Wish I had started sooner

I just want to add a bit to both the presence of, and opposition to, hope.

The disorder has stages, and it fluctuates. There are peaks and valleys. In the negative phases, some people identify with the disorder. In case of chronic sufferers with co-morbid depression or chronic adverse life situations, rationally, it appears that hope is a futile emotion. In both such cases, people with anxiety tend to identify with the disorder and defend it unknowingly (""how dare you insult my suffering!"")

People move on from these stages too, and people have life-changing experiences or their life situation changes for the better. Then they start distancing themselves from the disorder, seeing themselves as separate from the disorder and the disorder as a bad thing that _can actually go away_. Thus hope enters gently. Then they do not defend the suffering and the disorder, but seek ways to get out of it asap.

From a recent epiphany I had: https://np.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/g9tthy/regular_reminder_that_positive_affirmations_and/

> If you put a logical check in place to block the affirmation from reaching your animal mind using arguments like ""wowthanksimcured"" you cannot avail of the benefit of affirmations because you are actively blocking them from reaching the dumb accepting animal brain by rejecting them at the intellectual gate.
> 
> So, in short, dumb affirmations do work reasonably provided you blindly trust them for a while (""provisional faith"") and let them percolate down to your animal mind, and provided that you do not disrupt or uproot said percolation process regularly. Then you are catastrophizing, which is also a common thing in many suffering from anxiety.
> 
> Catastrophizing is a variant of complaining, especially crying foul excessively out of proportion to the danger or objecting out of proportion or displaying ruthless distrust of anyone or anything meaning to help.

I think you missed my point so much that you made my point in explaining that.

You are giving importance to loneliness as a fatal threat which does not kill within seconds, rather over years, while not giving that much importance to jaywalking which kills within seconds. The danger is much higher in jaywalking, but people look and trust that looking is enough, which it is not, because blind spots, eyes/brain cannot detect acceleration, people break rules, you can slip/trip/fall, and of course, you can not look properly and be distracted and not look at all.

Your fear is blowing the danger out of proportion when figures clearly state otherwise. Motor vehicle deaths are both instant and more common than loneliness deaths where something can be done over time and a wide variety of interventions are possible over the years long periods upto fatality.

Think about it. Re-read my post.

What you believe need not be exactly true, because it is a belief. Fear is essentially an imagination. Fear is never concrete beyond the fear chemicals in your brain. Danger is a mathematical probability of real outcomes. Fear is neither about mathematics, nor concrete. It is just imagination, by definition. Mammals that lack imagination have very little fear. Think of stray dogs, cats, or herbivores on grasslands. They are always in danger of being attacke dby larger animals or rival packs. But they never bother about tomorrow. They never bother about going hungry tomorrow. Because they cannot imagine. We can imagine, so we sit multiplying. This, we call worry. When we fear-imagine too much too often, we call it anxiety. When we fear-imagine so hard that it produces neural overload, we call it a panic attack and we go from fight/flight into reptilian freeze.

They implied that the summer should have helped slow down the spread in tropical countries considerably, and there were many studies on the temp+RH dependence of the virus which predicted that the heat and humidity might help, specially one which said that RH between 50 and 80 was best to kill the virus because winter viruses need low temps and RH < 50 while summer viruses need high temps and RH > 80.

Edit2: I made a mistake in the response below by mixing up loneliness with being alone. So I have struck out the stuff I got wrong and italicised the stuff I added instead. But the overall recovery mechanism and facts about the disorder are the same and still apply, so I have left that unchanged. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness) says that loneliness is the painful response to the perception of being isolated. The few times I have experienced _loneliness_ I have felt severely about having no one to turn to, with anticipated fears of being ostracised (I had social anxiety for a while and I felt more lonely, helpless and scared among people I knew, rather than while alone at home because their stares dug deep into my skin). At other times when I was actually alone and felt lonely, I was afraid ""terrible things"" (vague, non-specific sense of doom) might happen, and I would have to face said ""terrible things"" by myself while feeling very helpless.

So please do not take any of the following as a personal attack. If I did not want to really help, I would not type all this out. I hope you won't misunderstand :)

I want to help, and I definitely do not want to hurt. But I want to show you, by example, the common subtle flaw in your argument. So I'm going to use another example which is not generating fear for you (hopefully).

> In some cases, people with anxiety are simply seeing something that most people don't see but is actually there.
>
> Take the fear of crossing roads for example. To avoid accidents, people should always cross roads on subways. Most regular people take driver responsibility for granted and do not worry about this as much. That is why they don't have anxiety when jaywalking and that's why they smoothly go about crossing roads when there is no traffic and possibly save a lot of time in their daily commute.
> 
> However once you realize how dreadful getting hit by a car is, and how important it is to stay alive.........then you start to get anxiety during approaching roads that you need to cross where there is no subway. Because you now realize what is at stake if just one driver does not care or does not see you in time. So there's a pressure on you to stay alive.
> 
> Regular people don't think about all this.........but the danger is still there. Most kids don't see it either, because they don't see the danger associated with jaywalking. So they can cross roads without anxiety.
> 
> I read the bit about worrying not helping, but how do you not worry when you see the danger?

See the difference?

Edit: Explanation:

Fear and danger are 2 very different things. Fear is in your nerves and brain. Danger is a mathematical probability outside your brain and body. Fear varies from person to person and for each person, the fear for the same activity is different at different times, under different conditions, at different ages, and so on. Danger is always constant and objective. Fear is imagined, and is nature's way of protecting you from dangers, it has evolved in all sentients, it is dynamic. Danger is a mathematical objective fact. Soldiers know the danger when they go to war, police know the danger when they join the force, but fear is something they either have less of or know how to control.

You obviously knew all this. But in your phrase above ""how do you not worry when you see the danger"" it is apparent that you cannot identify that this is fear, not danger.

You have had terrible experiences of loneliness. Most likely, the mismatch between your extraversion-seeking personality and the negative thoughts you experienced in your mind make you abhor and avoid the whole experience of loneliness. You are running away from loneliness because you fear your past experience of it. _It combines severe helplessness, and guaranteed doom_. ~~But you would obviously know that a good percentage of the world's population loves solitude and being alone. There is no disturbance, you can do what you please, there is no social pressure, you can explore your thoughts, and so on.~~ The _danger_ is not real, but the _fear_ is very big. And the fear is not of being alone or not having friends, it is of _your bad experience_ of loneliness which is very different from the experience of loneliness of other people. For some, it is mild, for you it is severe. ~~For instance, I am not afraid of being alone, I love being alone.~~

That's about loneliness, objectively.

Now back to how to deal with your specific fear. For that, you need to be lonely again, once and write down what exactly it is that you are afraid of in loneliness. In [Dr. Claire Weekes' book ""hope & help for your nerves""](https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Help-Your-Nerves-Anxiety/dp/0451167228), she explains the four step process of winning over anxiety:

> **Face** the fear
>
> **Accept** the sensations and feelings
>
> **Float** through them watching them but not getting involved in them
> 
> **Let time pass** so that all the pathways affected by fear responses are exposed to the above 3 steps and the feeling of safety and security that is naturally available, by default, to all animals, reclaims all the pathways once used by your anxiety.

So what you do is break down the ominous enemy whom you run away from, by facing it, analysing it, writing it down, then realising how it is not as bad as for you to flee from it, and then let it pass through your system without objecting to it or reacting to it or even believing it, just observing it like a robot. When you stop fighting it, then your natural habit of feeling safe without reason takes over and heals you. This is why you need to let time pass. 

You have to first accept the fearful state and mainly stop fighting it.

Very many times, one finds that the fear is much bigger than the object of fear itself.

Again, referring to 

> but how do you not worry when you see the danger?

can you explain how worrying can help in even a small way? I believe that you will not be able to satisfactorily answer that, because worry is all fluff; OTOH, _doing something about loneliness_ (an action such as sending friend requests on FB or going to the local pub or beach or music band) is very different from worrying constantly about eventually ending up lonely - imaginations about a hypothetical possibility brought forward in time in an attempt to solve it once and for all.

We often miss the difference between thoughts and actions, which is the whole cause of anxiety. Re-read the above paragraph till you understand the timing problem. You will be alone 3-4 weeks in the future (which is June 2020) and you are afraid of a loneliness experience in the past (April 2020) and you are sitting here spoiling your May 2020 in the hope that by _merely worrying_ i.e. by repeatedly thinking the same frightening things, _somehow you will **magically** get more friends_ or friends that will never abandon you. This is precisely the disorder of imagination that you are suffering from.

> sometimes I get catastrophising thoughts about this disorder

When you're mind is screaming danger, you first participate and scream with it. Contribute your willing energy to the panic but only by screaming. I used to even vocalise by muttering ""I'm going to die right now, I'm going to die right now"" about 10-20 times and I would watch what I am doing while doing this. Then the actual fearing thought process would realise that there is no real danger, and it does not need to warn ""me"" any more because I'm already shouting what it is saying. Remember, it is fear trying to protect you overactively and being hypervigilant, too much in advance, and trying to solve the whole problem immediately. The catastrophizing process has 2 components: (a) fear, which intend to protect you, which you should _appreciate_ (this is therapeutic) and (b) complaining due to either a history of hurt or negativity picked up from somewhere, or sometimes even ego or a habit of ""whining"". 

Depending on what causes the complaining habit you have to handle it slightly differently. 

If its a history of hurt, handling (a) will gradually take care of it, but this takes times.

If it's ego (""I am suffering, I have a right to complain, I am angry and I will complain till I am alive"") then you need to learn a bit of humility and see how the majority of humanity and whole of the meat animal kingdom suffers and yet they complain less. 

If it's just a habit of whining, well, then you have to learn to let go of hurts. Forgive and forget. The past is the past. It's gone. The only thing to be gained by remembering the pain from the past is misery, so you spoil your present and push your future down the path of more pain. So, forgive and forget, for your own good.

Anxiety,fpfrknw,t1_fpevwkj,1588580935.0,"You're just 18. This is typically the age (late teens, early twenties) that several mental disorders with genetic / hereditary components start. 

Anxiety, panic, and OCD are the ones I have directly dealt with, so I can guarantee some things. As long as you don't have nerve damage (physical), or another severe disorder like schizophrenia (it's easy to be anxious whether you have other disorders but mostly you don't have it) or some environmental cause (like your family is in criminal underworld and so violence is common), I can guarantee that if you go to a therapist, read the books by experts and practise what they tell you to do, take medicine regularly, and generally understand your disorder well, you will be able to recover at least 90% within 6 months.

This applies to almost everyone, not just you. Recovery (90%) is common. Then it becomes like the common cold. You get two bad weeks every year,  or maybe four, but the rest of the year is very much a happy or ordinary life. High functioning anxiety is also common in industry, and you find a lot of highly qualified, high earning people who take on important jobs with complexity and they too have anxiety, but they know how to manage it really well. 

You don't have to be high functioning and get stressed due to work, you can choose a lighter career path and be happy in life.

Also, nature, plants and animals are able to heal people with anxiety extremely effectively, like a good painkiller. So if you have anxiety consider volunteering at an animal shelter or adopting a pet or playing with animals, feeding birds or simply just going out into nature. Since all of us are in self-quarantine or lockdown right now, you can watch videos of animals, nature sounds videos or youtube and enjoy most of the benefits sitting at home. Just use a laptop or desktop if you have one so that your feel the connect more vividly.

> Is It likely that mental or social skill degradation could happen if I carry on struggling with anxiety, or is it more likely to be a success story like you?

*There is no permanent skill degradation in anxiety.* It is a _repeating temporary_ condition. By definition, you are fleeing an imaginary predator. This is common in the millions of years of evolution, and therefore does not leave irreversible degradation. Everything bad can and will be reversed. You're just 18. I doubt you have spent enough time with the disorder to actually get degraded enough to worry about it! (Of course this is general, your specific case could be different)

Depression might co-exist and that might make it appear that you have permanent damage, because of the negativity, but when you recover from anxiety, you will feel such relief and positivity that you will be able to overcome any additional burdens easily.

All you need to do is understand your disorder, watch your thoughts, write them down, see what is obviously wrong, do the opposite of the wrong pattern, take medicine without fail and get out into nature or watch nature videos regularly. And of course, the regular - exercise well, eat well, sleep well, and so on.

For the medicine see a qualified medical doctor who can prescribe it.
 
And buy the books (< $20) and see the videos (youtube, free) to understand the disorder.

> I know you're trying to save me, but it's OK honey, there is no danger.

----

Now the next thing i'm going to say might sound slightly unscientific but is perfectly valid and repeatable, I only don't know the right medical term for it.

We have voices of all kinds moving through several neural pathways in our minds at all times. Most of them are physically located in various different systems / parts of the brain / brain stem / spinal cord, right down the back of your neck and deeper still.

If the screaming voice from the back of your mind is consoled or calmed by the thinking voice from the brain, it's only effective for 5 minutes or 10 minutes. But if you can get the screaming voice from the back of your mind _itself_ to say that there is no danger, the change is dramatic and permanent. 

----

The reason many people keep suffering despite knowing all of the coping mechanisms and therapy skills is that they don't have the crucial skill of identifying separate voices and then speaking through those individual voices.

It's the mental version of the [Jacobson PMR technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-jacobson-relaxation-technique). 

In the JPMR technique, if you want to relax your right bicep, you first tense the right bicep willingly, focus on it, then let it fall loose, and you do this once again and then let the right bicep drop dead - total relaxation. Then you repeat this with your left bicep, both your triceps, and all other muscles and so on (Typically you start from muscles of the toes, not biceps, but the above bicep thing was just an example that you can easily do while reading this post.)

So, now you have a calm voice say near your throat, a screaming voice in the deep back of your neck, and thinking brain at the top of your head, just below your skull.

If your brain voice _thinks_ ""oh this is rubbish, there's no danger"", this fact is registered in the brain, _but not in the deep back of your neck where the screaming originates_. For that you need constant repetition, so that on the off chance that your screaming voice at the deep back of your neck randomly picks up the sentiment of security from the general feeling of security moving around in various voices and pathways.

----

Or if you're skilled you can first start screaming danger even louder _from the deep back of your neck_, actively, and then, like in JPMR, acively reduce the volume of screaming. In this fashion, you make the screaming anxiety more under your willing control. Next you modulate and flex that control by screaming louder and louder, then lesser and lesser, then again louder, lesser, louder, lesser.

Now you have much more direct control over the screaming voice at the deep back of your neck. 

Now you play your big move. Using that newly gained willing control, you _scream_ (because you only know how to scream danger so far) from the voice at the deep back of your neck, that you are safe and that this is only fear doing the necessary job of protecting you, that actually there is no danger at all.

If you do this a few times, not more, a moment of cognitive dissonance appears where the screaming voice from the deep back of the neck is confused about the actual state of danger. Then comes the realisation of the meaning of the sentence.

> _only fear doing the necessary job of protecting you, and actually there is no danger at all._

When the screaming voice itself has screamed a few times that there is no danger, instantly, you feel a weight lifted and you can feel the palpable brightness lightening up your mind. You have broken the loop in this particular voice  - in the deep back of the neck.

----

There are many more pathways and voices that fear and that cause panic, and you have to identify, isolate, control (scream loudly, then scream less, then scream the antidote statement) and then liberate each pathway and voice. Some pathways and voices that scream danger are activated only once in a while, so they can catch you by surprise even a few weeeks after not really feeling too much anxiety. Seasonal changes could also affect mood, energy, and cause repeats, but if you're trained in speaking directly through each pathway, you should be able to calm yourself almost like reflex after few months of practice.

----

Then, you truly begin to see the humongous, shameful mess that you were actually living with, a bowl of poison spaghetti, much deeper, much darker than you thought, for years.

Anxiety,fpccsur,t3_gcgt1r,1588495708.0,"> If we were that way in childhood, why can't we reach that state again? Is it possible?

We can. It is possible. Recovery to 90-95% is possible.

I'm 43 and happily single and everyone says I'm still a kid. Because basically all I do is work on computers, watch cartoons, standup comedy and videos of cute animals online. I make slightly more than average money (software engineering) and I live with my parents. So, basically you can be a kid. I'm pretty thoughtful and helpful to people, so I'm not a parasitic manchild, just a child at heart. And I find that if you separate people's egos from their behavour, everyone is essentially a child. This is more evident in people who are above 50. Adult - ego = child.

If you were once a happy child, your brain and mind know how to be happy. Recovery is much easier than in cases where childhood was also bad.

The recovery process is too big to explain in one post. So I'll give you all the resources I've compiled (at the end of this post) and some general comments on the topic. I've spent over 20 years suffering from anxiety, panic attacks and OCD, although only severely for 2 phases of 1-2 years separated by almost 16-17 years of high functioning anxiety.

And I can say that I have recovered to at least 90% normalcy the second time. I can laugh at any time, I crack jokes all the time, I make friends with people on the street easily, I do challenging technical work (although average  level in my industry - software engineering). Many things contributed to my recovery.

I've documented everything in a series of submissions to this subreddit. Every bit of what was useful to me is mentioned here. Take the time to look at it (give it an hour every day). None of it makes me any money or benefit, so you can be assured of not finding imaginary fluff to sound smart. Everything I've written is real and experienced. Especially useful among these are the videos and the books by world renowned experts.

----

The central fact you have to realise is that anxiety is the fight or flight (or freeze) response of the frightened animal mind inside all of us powered by active imagination leading us to be in a constant imagined state of danger that looks real but is actually very benign.

Anxiety robs us of essential faith in goodness in life. It destroys the general belief that life is good, by constantly assaulting the belief and thought structures in our mind that give us security and safety, by doubting and suspecting everything positive and neutral, complaining loudly, not letting us sleep peacefully, by imagining vivid negatives and focussing only on those worst case negatives. 

It does not help that when we grow up we learn that the world runs on power, greed and evil, which wrongly reinforces the excessively negative worldview that anxiety forces upon us relentlessly.

So we begin to believe that only the worst will happen, that we are in danger at all times, that we need to be on high alert to constantly guard against sudden attacks, that every activity needs to be done in the same hasty fight-or-flight manner, that relaxing even for a moment means certain death.

This is the disorder.

The thing is that in many cases, there are simply neurological or biochemical processes or systems that are misadjusted that cause this constant overacting fear mechanism.

There are 3 major ways you can solve anxiety, which is a disorder of extreme insecurity and fear for life:

- Faith. If you can have faith in some one or some thing that will always protect you, unconditionally, then you have faith in that thing and you trust it to save you from your imagined dangers.  This is a useful crutch, not a full recovery mechanism.

- Knowledge/awareness - understand your disorder, document it, watch it play with your mind and then let it pass through you without touching you internally. A sort of running commentary of what you are thinking is necessary for this.

- Medicine. If there is a neurological, semi-structural, or biochemical reason (genetic) for your anxiety, then medicine is necessary.

> but anxiety can insert itself into that natural process and '' fragment '' it. 

In computer terms, anxiety is the habit of destructively hacking your own computer repeatedly 24x7. Because you think that by hacking the computer the computer will learn to protect itself magically.

If you can internalise these 2 facts, half the battle is won:

> Worrying does not actually solve anything. Doing something about the problem solves it. All worry is fluff and lies. It appears that you are doing something about the problem by worrying, but no, you are doing nothing about it. Worry is a complete, thorough and total waste that does _nothing at all_ to reduce the danger.


and

> Fear is your friend. It is meant to protect you from actually dangerous things by being a warning mechanism. When it overfires, or misfires, repeatedly you get an anxiety disorder. Fear is your friend, it loves you and wants to protect you, but is badly mistaken in its approach. See its intention of protecting you and forgive it.

You will swear by your ""perfect fit"" medication once you see how much relief is to be felt by merely popping a pill. Therapy works over time and makes the improvement mostly permanent, but if you want to get back to living, rather than just not dying, _quickly_, then medication is the best way to do it. Klonopin and some other benzodiazepines work for a lot of people, but you should neither try out medications yourself, nor will your pharmacist give you these medicines without a proper prescription.

If you have such a cause, it is imperative that such a cause be addressed immediately because you might begin to believe that anxiety recovery techniques and therapy do not work, while the fact is that the neurological cause overrides all gains made by therapy and resets the symptoms to troublesome each time. Typically every time you wake up after sleeping for a few hours or after a night's sleep."

After 20 years of fighting various stages, after reading 3 good books, I can say with confidence that the steps needed for one stage of recovery are often different from the steps needed for another stage of recovery. That's why the cautious title and that's why all the pre-conditions and details mentioned.

It may not work for everyone at this moment in time, because everyone is at different stages with different variants in the disorder, but at some point people who recover do pass through the stage where positive self-talk is immensely useful. 

If it does not help you, because of specifics of your stage or variant, ignore it. I don't expect it to work for everyone, I don't claim it is a whole treatment package. I merely claim it to be useful to many people if applied correctly by them to their own specific situation. Hence the links to google searches, to encourage readers to do their own research."

The one thing that helped me in COVID-19 is that I am a decently serious long term nature lover and while the pandemic is really macabre, when I see the positive things that it is doing to nature, to the environment, to animals, to powerful people who are now forced to cooperate, to govts who are now forced to listen to scientists, to people who are now much more environmentally conscious, I feel there are many good things in the pandemic. For example, did you know that pollution deaths and motor accident deaths have gone down dramatically? Meat factories being shut down means that animals are not being slaughtered unduly (I was vegan for a few years). Coal is almost certainly going away.

And most importantly, COVID-19 has a fatality rate of <0.5% and due to which nations and corporations will be forced to change the way of running the world. This means we might actually avoid the bigger catastrophe - climate change, which is expected to have a fatality rates beyond 10%-20% of the world's population, and it's not just those countries over there, it's you and me. It's almost a gentle slap to stop us from wiping ourselves out brutally 10 years down the line. The media does not report it much but Syria was a climate crisis. Imagine Syria-like crises everywhere. That was the future we were on track to experience. COVID-19 is almost an intervention by nature. I never expected conservative governments to recommend immediate monthly payments to poor people who lost jobs. That's happening. Mass healthcare is happening. There are many good sides to COVID-19, if you look past the death numbers. Serious.

But that is just my point of view."

Coronavirus,fo7m4im,t1_fo6ph1g,1587580676.0,"I'll take the invitation. Also, disclaimer: Possibly stupid questions, as I'm a layman.

1. Can't we study the structure of the virus and make a chemical that only kills the virus or some part of it so that it does not reproduce? For example, the equivalent of Quorum Sensing Disruption in bacteria. From what I read, the genome is sequenced, the strains are isolated and sorted (nextstrain.org) in the 1000s. So why is not possible to isolate a series of molecular links that are crucial to the virus to survive or to reproduce, and attack those? I understand that most of the virus has similar organic building blocks to various systems and organs of our body, so a direct poison would effectively kill the virus (bleach, 90% alcohol, soap water) but also kill us. Hence the poison needs to be made very carefully and so on. But surely, there is hope in finding one molecule or a series of attacks that do something to the virus' reproduction, which would give the body an easier time and more chances to learn how to identify and attack it.

2. Why focus so much on the vaccine which really should be tested properly and hence will take time? (I know this is not the fault of scientists', this is the demand of people, media, politicians, etc)

3. Where can I see any variant of the virus genome represented visually? This is very poor resolution: https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/ip-ips013120.php"

Anxiety,fo644s7,t1_fo4d2k8,1587545802.0,"The complaining habit is often co-morbid with anxiety - officially called ""catastrophizing"". Seasoned sufferers (myself included) are inclined to immediately jump to say ""wowthanksimcured"" without seeing the nuances of the affirmation practice or its accumulated effect upon constant repetition. Constant repetition of negative thoughts is often half the disorder. So constant repetition of positive thoughts acts as a good ~~anecdote~~ _antidote_, but our _loyalty to hopelessness and negativism, evolved and perfected from years or decades of suffering_ prevent us from quick recovery.

I mean it should be *obvious to not do this, but many people with anxiety or depression swear unfailing loyalty to negativity, pessimism and catastrophizing*. 

Whereas *recovery can use loyalty to hope*.

So much that _an attack on negativity is taken as a personal attack on the sufferer_."

It doesn't appear to have actually used the aerosol route as much as the study finds. Something is missing. Maybe breeze, maybe temperature+humidity, or even maybe the percentage of asymptomatic people is even higher than we thought, which means the Infection Fatality Rate is even lower than 0.5%.

With what they say - 12 hours - all closed spaces should have been devastating COVID hotspots by now. Hospitals should have been completely unlivable. That's not the case. Something significant is missing as a pre-condition for this aerosol angle to work."
