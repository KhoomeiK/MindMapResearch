BipolarReddit,fpqe5zc,t3_gewwwv,1588820775.0,"I definitely feel this. One of my favorite coping mechanisms is reaching out because it's been so effective in the past. However, im in my mid twenties. A  lot of my friends have too much free time and are lazy and apathetic or they're extremely busy and just fmsuoer focused on their careers or different or worlds. The only thing that really helped was trying to develop some other healthy coping habits. 

I never considered myself an artist, but doodling just relaxes me sometimes. I used to do free flow writing and that was the closest thing I could get to meditating other than when I'm exercising. Try some different stuff outside your comfort zone it might help."

You'll find out what works for you over time. There are actually studies that say the fewer sexual experiences a man has, the more satisfying those experiences will be."
