Divorce,fr3yabj,t1_fr2jxv6,1589869763.0,Solid advice! It‚Äôs better not to rush to a divorce.
jlpt,fr04nyc,t1_fqz6d4n,1589783635.0,"Thank you for answering. As I am just staying at home now, I would be probably memorizing a lot of new Kanjis a day. Wish me good luck!"
jlpt,fr04j5a,t1_fqzsfrb,1589783520.0,"Creating balance between learning grammar, reading, Kanji, and vocab is important. We should not focus only on improving one aspect over another. Honestly, the best way to improve our levels is reading a lot. By reading, we basically improve our understanding of the grammar, Kanji, and Vocab. Reading is the hardest part. Still, we cannot just start reading without knowing the commonly used Kanji. We will be stopping in every sentence attempting to translate Kanjis we do not know. In my opinion, memorizing the necessary Kanji at the beginning will make the journey easier. This is Chinese students find it easy to pass N1 or N2. They can understand the meaning of most of the Japanese Kanjis."
Divorce,fqu7vww,t3_gkstgz,1589653734.0,"Divorce was one of the toughest experiences for me. We had no kids. I truly loved her. I tried so hard to make the marriage work, but I failed. 

In my opinion, I think there are three factors that determine how quick or late a person move on. I can summarize them in Real Love, the Length of the marriage relationship, and the reason behind the divorce.

Real Love: this explains itself. It is obvious that it is so hard to leave someone you truly love. Divorce is somehow similar to death. You cannot just cut all connections with your love at once. You will have to surely cry about the person over and over.  No matter what happened between you and the ex, your ex must have done a lot of great things to you. You must have shared great memories. You can‚Äôt just wipe them easily. These things make it hard for you to move on.

The length of the marriage relationship: this is an important factor as the duration of the marriage shapes who you are. Marriage changes the personality and the identity of the person. For example, if you become a father/a mother. Your identity as a single person no longer exists. You are not the same the person you used to be before the divorce. So, after the divorce, you have a mental shock because you suddenly leave your father/mother/married identity. This means that you have to rediscover your self. You know to shape you new identity after divorce, you most likely will not have any friends. You will be kinda be isolated. It will take you a while to build a new identity, to find your new self. This step is the hardest, depending on the age, the upbringing of the person, the type of the divorce itself (friendly divorce), some people may go through  it faster than others. 

The reason behind the divorce: this depends on the type of the problem(s) that led to divorce. Someone may blame himself for the divorce. One of the spouses may think he failed to make the marriage work. This is very painful. It‚Äôs a horrible feeling of guilt especially if you are a man! You always want to fix things. It‚Äôs hard sometimes to accept that there are broken things and we may never be able to fix them. We just need to make peace with this idea.

As far as I know, it takes a longer time for men to get over divorce because in many cases women stay in the same house with the kids while the husband will have to leave the house. While it does take longer for men to get over the divorce, it is indeed painful in the first year. But later, it gets easier for men. On the other hand, women do not suffer a lot in the first months of the divorce, but after a year or more, they may start feeling the agony of  regret. I am talking in general. This all stay relative.

While I was going through divorce, I had to read a lot of stories. The above is a short summary of what I learned. I hope you get over it! it is not easy. My apologies for any typos."

jlpt,fqf8dpf,t3_ghju8k,1589320433.0,"I already passed JLPT N2.
Learning Chinese will NOT help you pass N2. Actually, it may make you fail because you are going to lose focus on Japanese. 
Passing JLPT N2 requires a lot of Japanese listening and some business and advanced grammar. These components (grammar, listening, and speaking) are hard even for Chinese native speakers who are trying to pass N2 or N1.
There are also some specifications that are unique to Japanese language such as Keigo, sonkeigo, kenjougo. You would not know them if you don‚Äôt dedicate enough time to learning Japanese.
Learning Chinese is not easy at all. So, you would be wasting your time on a new language. The only advantage you may get is knowing the meaning of some Japanese kanji. But even the meanings may differ in many cases. Chinese characters are not written similar to Japanese characters even if they may look alike sometimes.
If your Chinese becomes at a native level, then you may have an advantage in the reading part of Japanese JLPT. That‚Äôs all. I recommend passing JLPT N2 or N1, then start learning Chinese. This will help you a bit with learning Chinese too. Of if you are eager about learning, you simply study it, passing N3 will make it easy for you as a beginner if Chinese language."

TrueOffMyChest,fnz7cvm,t1_fehnwdh,1587387930.0,"Men are more affected in the case of divorce. Many men lost their houses, went to jail, became homeless, and cannot even see their children after divorce. MGTOW is different than FDS. MGTOW are not fighting women. They are not misogynist. They are having a legal war. They  do not trust the family court as it clearly favors women over man. FDS is not (Women going their way). That is a huge difference."

alone,fimke2w,t3_f8nkn8,1582534208.0,"I believe that people have only two options.
Option 1: enjoy being alone. There are ways that allow you to meet up with people without telling a lot about yourself or becoming friends. Also, you can get what you want too.
Option 2: if the first option 1 is not suitable for you, then you just have to accept to take risk. Meet up with people, study their behaviors, avoid bad people, avoid making the same mistakes again, then if you are lucky your life will be probably brighter. Remember, being hurt is just part of life! It‚Äôs an experience. You will learn from it."

erectiledysfunction,fc22g68,t3_edd4fl,1577337739.0,"I am giving you two solutions: ( easy and hard)
You are in a position to use both of them to fix ED.
-Quit watching porn
-Masturbate only once a month of course never do that when watching porn. Just base that on your imagination. Imagine you are making love with your girlfriend.
-Sports: daily push up, hitting the gym
-Eat well
-Lose weight 
Quick fixes:
-To avoid embarrassing yourself with your girlfriend while working on fixing the source or ED. I recommend using Cialis not Viagra.
-Eat Multi Vitamins (Especially Niacin) this one is very important.
As we almost have the same age. Also, kinda had some ED embarrassing experiences. Feel free to contact me for motivating each other."

erectiledysfunction,fbd7fqe,t3_ec52yf,1576750700.0,"I recommend you stop watching porn. Also, if you really had to masturbate, you can do it only when it is really necessary. However, make it a rule that you must not watch porn while masturbating.
I stopped watching porn over a month now. I took the decision that I won‚Äôt watch it for the rest of my life not only for 90 days.
At the beginning, I could not erect my penis without porn. Now, I can do it. Quit watching porn and you will start gradually seeing the change. It won‚Äôt be immediate."

STD,f20cm94,t3_dbbol4,1569858082.0,"I am not a doctor. But, if this happens only after sex, I think it‚Äôs not mainly a sign of std. I am a male. I remember, after each ejaculation, it feels a bit different. I honestly find it normal. The reason is that our body is a programmed for peeing only when not having sex. If you pee after sex, there are body changes triggered only before and after the ejaculation to make the process of the sexual experience to go smoothly and the impregnation work properly. When there is a slight change (like having sex), it is normal to feel a bit weird when peeing. But remember if you feel any serious pain, checking with a doctor is inevitable."

If you stay, you will be hurt. If you leave, you will be hurt too. This is reality. 
The thing is that, even if after leaving her, you will definitely be hurt, there is a higher chance you will heal with time. But, if you stay with her, you will be more sick or sick eternally. It‚Äôs so sad we have to admit that we really cannot fix the situation as men when our wives or girlfriends are broken!"

They may blame you for bringing them to the world and not being able to provide them with a wealthy life. Why would you torture yourself for no reason. Your kids will leave you someday after they get married, your wife may very likely divorce you too. Being single is the best thing that can happen to you. 

Having a girlfriend is also an option as long as you are with the right woman. Dress well, go the gym, eat well, and see the world. Real men do not need women. Women need men. Do not cry like a woman, it makes you less than a man. Sorry for the harsh words!"

MGTOW2,ezcjcgq,t3_d0p8c9,1567835946.0,">marriage is still based on love, but it also is fundamentally an economic transaction. Many young men today have little to bring to the marriage bargain, especially as young women's educational levels on average now exceed their male suitors.

Marriage cannot be based on love if a woman is considering it as a bargain. Men no longer care about highly educated girls, all of what matters is what she brings to the table. In this generation, it should be equal. As men, we have the right to look for economically attractive women too. Otherwise, we are not in. Marriage is bullshit. They always end up in divorce. It is a bad deal for men. It does not work anyway. All men are out!"

My personal advice to you, never try to make her love you. Don‚Äôt try to please her. You must start looking after yourself, go to the gym, eat well, dress well, enjoy your life. Always be a good father. Most likely she will change her mind at some point. I guess that won‚Äôt matter to you anymore at that moment."
