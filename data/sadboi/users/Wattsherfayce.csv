Therapy feels good. But it's not a right or deserved. It's a luxury.   


The cost of private practice where fees are much higher- making it out of reach and a luxury to most. A lot of therapists would rather deal with clients who are high functioning professionals than taking clients from the hospital psych ward. ESPECIALLY in the US where mental health clinicians don't need to participate in the health care system or take insurance to keep their schedules full. That's why you can have a lot of mental health professionals in an area, but still have a shortage of care for people in need. You're even worse off if you're LGBTQ+, or POC when looking for therapy.

In lesser words- it's so so black and white. There is a lot of grey nuance people want to turn a blind eye to and pretend like it doesnt exist. You don't know everything about a client just because you are their therapist. Frankly, it should be none of their business. They are there to treat a patient, not judge them to see how much they can make off them."

Yea HPV doesn't have a cure but for most people the body is able to be cleared by their own immune system. You can also get the HPV vaccine to protect yourself against new infections of HPV.  


HPV is the most common STI and for most people it causes no symptoms. For some it causes genital warts (which there are treatments for), and it can cause cancer (stay on top of your gyno visits & you can catch this early like I did).

You are looking at it wrong. 2 grand a month is not a baseline for anything except ""shut the fuck up"" money to stop people from rioting in the streets and ransacking businesses. They did not want another ""L.A riot"" to happen- ever again. It to stop people from mass crime and suicide, so hospitals don't get more overwhelmed than they already are."

Because it's a federal benefit that is ""taxed"" it means that it will have to be payed back eventually. How that will look like will deeply affect peoples physical and mental health. Hopefully it is done in a way that people can afford. 

People on ODSP do not ""owe"" anything at the end of the year as it is a Provincial non taxable benefits, along with GHT/HST and Canada Child Benefits. Other forms of non taxable income include payments from life insurance, tax free savings accounts, lottery winnings, and inheritances. 

Having been on both sides, its hard times for everyone. Nobody has it better than anyone unless you're a superstar of some sort or a politician. Everyone is losing something right now, some more than others. But a loss is a loss is a loss. No point in making it the ""Who has it Worse"" Olympics.

Prior to 1993, the longest period of time without an increase in social assistance in Ontario was just 3 years, with 23 increases in the 26 years since 1967.

And now with Ford and his austerity cuts, bringing in an American auditing firm that costed the UK billions in damaged to their social welfare networks to go through our program to find 'savings' by forcing the disabled back to work, we are just beginning on the paved road to hell.

Such as:

\- more exercise (but not 3 hours before bed). Even just a 20 minute brisk walk outside will help.

\- decrease caffeine use, and stop consuming caffeine before 4-6PM (caffeine has a 6-8 hr half life on average). Consider switching to decaf.

\- keep a routine, especially around bed time. Go to bed and wake up at the same time. Stop using all screens at least 1 hour before bed, but if you must use one consider using a blue light filter.

\- Use your bed for sleeping (and sex) only.

\- If you can't sleep after 45 minutes in bed get up and do something low level and boring such as reading a book or listening to a podcast. Consider meditation (such as guided progressive muscle relaxation)

Get out for fresh air. Go for a short but brisk walk or just sit on your balcony/porch/near an open window.

Try guided meditations. Progressive Muscle Relaxation is something many find helpful. Even ASMR videos (the ppl who whisper and make soft sounds/nature noise).

Do you have a schedule you are keeping right now? Despite not being able to sleep do you still go to bed at the same time every night to try? If you watch TV or are on the computer or use your phone a lot before bed I recommend turning them off an hr before bed. If you must use I encourage to use a blue light filter on your screens as they stimulate your brains activity.

I am also BP but I am BP1. I have been diagnosed on 2015. It took me to year 4 to find the right medications, and even after that it stilled changed a little. Medication doesnt have to be a forever thing. It can be a very useful tool especially when mood episodes become so bad. And being on a medication doesnt mean it's never going to change or stop as life improves.

Without medication for BP1 I wouldn't have gotten my chronic pain and my PTSD under control. I would have stayed switching and would never be well enough to address any issues. Taking meds gave me a life back.

Do I enjoy taking meds? No. But I enjoy longer periods of mood stability when I do take them and that makes my life better on many levels. So if taking a few pills a day means I can enjoy more, it's a worthwhile trade off.

Please tell your SO the meds they put you on in hospital are meant to stabilize you, not be the end all of medication therapy. As your goals change your meds should as well. And let her know she can advocate for all this, and you can advocate for her if she would like your help.

I'm in a shit situation and can use hospital intervention myself currently. However I will be calling a crisis line and talk with them about it, see if they are taking people I to the crisis house during the pandemic.
