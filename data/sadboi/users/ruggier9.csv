There is some improvement for me but not a lot, and it's been almost 6 weeks now at this dose.  Even so, the slight change I felt from it was at first great because it was at least better than feeling absolutely awful all the time.  And I relate entirely to what you described, that feeling you get where you have a lot of things to do, but after you do some of them you still don't feel good about it, so why bother?  And also, the constant feeling of dread. 

That's interesting that it has created a better payoff in therapy for you.  I'm curious to see how it will effect me in therapy, I just started with a new therapist, had my 3rd session with him a couple weeks ago.  Next session is on the 20th, I think we are just past the introductory stages where he gets my history and we determine what needs to be focused on.  I'm looking forward to it.

I was on Buspar in the past, I took it in combination with the Cymbalta.  I don't know if it did much for me or not, I had since tried it again briefly and I didn't seem to benefit much from it on it's own, though I wasn't on it for very long the second time I tried it, might not have been long enough to notice the benefits anyways."

I was originally started at 10 mg but the anxiety it was giving me was too much for me to handle, so we went down to 5 mg.

AskPsychiatry,fn0ktp1,t1_fmyezw8,1586543781.0,"If I had to choose, I would choose Cymbalta over the Lexapro for the increase in motivation I felt.  She didn't say why she wanted to go with Lexapro over Cymbalta, my guess is that she thought it was my previous psychiatrist who wanted to take me off of it when really it was my idea to try stopping.  I was on it for years at 60 mg (even at 120 mg a day for a while) and it really helped me a lot, I was able to go to school and work back when I was on it and I had more drive to do things and I miss that greatly.  Life felt fun then.

My only reason for having an interest in combining them is that I thought I read that Cymbalta isn't a 5ht1a agonist and that may be why Lexapro feels a bit different to me?   I may be mistaken though, googling it really quick right now I can't find any information on that one way or the other.  For whatever reason Lexapro makes me feel calmer and more cerebral, it's nice.  But I would still prefer Cymbalta for the enjoyable driven feeling I had.

She also mentioned venlafaxine as an option in the past, would that be my best bet then?  I thought I read that one does effect 5ht1a in addition to the norepinephrine I'm after.  Maybe venlafaxine would give me both feelings?

Edit; Sorry I should mention I've been on Lexapro 5 mg for about 5.5 weeks, I don't know if that's long enough for me to assess it fully yet.  Could it also start to give me motivation?"

I had no problems for a long time, but about 2 years ago I developed brain fog to the point that the prospect of driving became worrisome and now I rarely drive and usually need to get rides.  My psych suspects it's the gabapentin and soon we will look into lowering the dose, I think she wants to get down to 900 mg per day.

I've tried mirtazapine, though that was at the full dose, for insomnia.  Strangely, I had a very strong akathisia response to mirtazapine at the full dose.

By the next day it was a lot better, I haven't taken any Lexapro in two days now but I still feel it a little bit, but it's like 90% better already.  I stopped taking the B6 as I read it shouldn't be taken with Lexapro, I think because it can increase serotonin, I don't want to get serotonin syndrome, though people do combine B6 with SSRI's, I don't want to risk it.  I guess B6 would then be better suited to neuroleptic induced akathisia and not from SSRI's, if you want to take them at the same time.  I took the Lexapro for 6 days, tried both 10 and 5 mg doses, and every day was bad with the akathisia, and it just kept getting worse.  Very disappointing because aside from that I was starting to feel pretty good, but the akathisia just overpowers all the positive attributes many times over unfortunately.

I had to eventually discontinue this herb around Christmas due to encountering the side effect I so often get with a high dose of antipsychotic, that of akathisia.  It did very much start to feel like an antipsychotic, but then also started giving me that side effect along with it.  It was very disappointing to have to stop, and I believe Aripiprazole has some of the highest rates of causing akathisia in its users (Uncaria rhycnhophylla has a method of action very similar to that of Aripiprazole, IIRC it was dopamine/serotonin partial agonism).  It made me feel very tense, and have to pace around after I took it the last few times, I've had bad akathisia from many different antipsychotics in the past, this was the same thing.  It was actually at Christmas dinner where I had the worst bout of akathisia, I took my afternoon dose and then by the time dinner came around, I began feeling very tense, then had to start pacing around nervously, then had to take my emergency dose of trihexyphenidyl to alleviate it.  This kept occurring after I took it, so I had to stop.  What I've learned from all this is that I firmly believe it has an antipsychotic effect, and feels very similar to Aripiprazole, to which its method of action is sometimes compared.

Not everyone will encounter this side effect, I am very sensitive to experiencing extrapyramidal symptoms from antipsychotics, I've tried many different ones and encountered it, both prescription, and herbal.  Since trying Uncaria rhynchophylla, I tried CBD isolate again, giving that a good two weeks before I had to abandon that one too due to experiencing extrapyramidal effects, that time it was dystonia (which I've also experienced in the past, from Ziprasidone, so again I knew what it felt like, knew what was going on, and knew to treat it with trihexyphenidyl or Diphenhydramine.  As with Ziprasidone, the CBD caused my jaw to sort of get stuck open, and my back to tighten up, causing me to feel the need to arch my back.  This is probably rare with CBD, but I am very sensitive to such things from AP's.)  CBD isolate was the best supplement I've tried though for my Schizoaffective disorder, it beats out any prescription I've ever taken too, so if you're trying to treat something like that, I would recommend it over this herb.  I just unfortunately couldn't tolerate it, having to stop that one was a huge disappointment.  It also helped clear up my brain fog and anxiety while I was on it.

I can't remember the name of the drug but there is currently another mainstream brand of purified CBD currently in trials somewhere (I think a European country) for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and Schizophrenia, I hope that will open further people up to treatment options in the near future.  This is also good news as I believe these drugs such as Epidiolex are purified CBD without any trace amounts of THC in them as you'd find in CBD oils, even in CBD isolates, so people can take drug tests without running into issues.  It's really sad that currently people in many places around the world with issues such as with mental health or akathisia can be made well enough to get a job thanks to a CBD oil but then they could fail the drug test in the job application process."

If you're worried about Iran's response, I'm worried about that too.

Nootropics,fcw467y,t3_eixpif,1578016740.0,"I am interested in both your post and this herb, thank you for posting these links, it's fascinating new information for me.  I have a couple things to say, first that I have tried cat's claw Uncaria tomentosa in the past and had high hopes for it for the treatment of mental health issues, possibly being made worse by my contracting lyme disease about 8 - 10 years ago (my memory is a problem.)  I was bitten by a tick and developed a bullseye rash at the site of the bite and promptly got antibiotic treatment, however the disease can still [persist](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6521364/).  I later had worsening neurological symptoms, so I decided to try Uncaria tomentosa cat's claw to see if it would help, however soon after starting it I began feeling very sick.  It consistently gives me a flu-like sickness with vomiting and generally feeling awful overall.  I've read around and was also told that it can cause an autoimmune response in susceptible individuals, I guess by ramping up the immune system so much, so unfortunately this herb isn't for everyone (of course, no herb is a good match for everyone.)  I've read other accounts of this herb making some people sick, look at the 1 star reviews for the various vendors for this herb on Amazon and you can find some.  It is an interesting and beneficial herb for a lot of people though.

The other thing I'd like to talk about is what I have recently started using now instead, something that was already mentioned on this post, the related herb Uncaria rhynchophylla.  I made a post about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/eaq2ek/uncaria_rhynchophylla_antipsychotic_and/) that you might find interesting.  Both herbs contain Rhynchophylline as you mentioned, as well as various other chemicals I am finding beneficial.

It may be the tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids (TOA) that I'm finding beneficial (such as Rhynchophylline) that act on the CNS, whereas the pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids (POA) as found in Uncaria tomentosa were the chemicals giving me trouble through the immune boosting effects.  So the Uncaria rhynchophylla might not be treating the lyme directly (I am unsure about that) but I am still gaining mental health benefits.

What do you like about Uncaria tomentosa specifically?  Being such an avid drinker of it for so long, there must be some reason you like it.  Just for prevention of neurodegeneration and illness?

Edit; Uncaria rhynchophylla also contains proanthocyanidins such as epicatechin, the substance in the study you linked said to be responsible for "" both “plaque and tangle” reducing and inhibitory activity. """

## ""5. Conclusion

In the present study, we investigated the pharmacokinetic interaction of ketamine and rhynchophylline based on a newly established UPLC-MS/MS method, which showed that rhynchophylline can increase the absorption and inhibit the metabolism of ketamine; meanwhile ketamine can increase the absorption and induce the metabolism of rhynchophylline. Hepatic enzyme was not able to completely explain their interaction *in vivo* of rats, and there were no relevant reports of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase, drug transport protein, and binding rate of plasma protein on this result. Further researches still need to be conducted to study the relevant mechanism, and attention should be given on the results that may be caused by their interactions clinically."""
