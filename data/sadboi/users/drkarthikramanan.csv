In my 20's, I was successful in my corporate career, I was a high performer, etc etc. But inside, nobody knew how lonely and ashamed I was. I was very overweight, had no self-confidence, so dating went nowhere. Meanwhile my friends were all getting married. It was brutal, honestly. I was depressed and nobody knew it.

Then at one point, I decided it had to change. I switched to a plant based diet and lost 100 pounds. Along the way I discovered I needed to help others do the same, so I quit my career on wall street and went back to medical school. In doing so, I discovered the person I was meant to be. I discovered who I truly was beneath the shame. And by living into that vision of myself, I effortlessly attracted the love of my life.

We got married at 35 years old. Behind my friends? Sure. But now I also have friends my age who got married in their early 20's, they and their spouses grew into different people, and now they're divorced or on the verge of it.

What I learned is that feeling behind is entirely perspective. I found the woman of my dreams and married her. I have more energy and purpose and health now at 36 than I did at 21. And I get to help other ambitious individuals end self-criticism and silence the negative voice in their head by teaching principles of everyday mental health.

Looking back, I wouldn't have it any other way. Hang in there friend. Design your future self and live into that vision today.
