wemetonline,f9k01k0,t3_e5fqxm,1575389799.0,"Sooo i met my girlfriend on an app called yubo. The app actually grosses me out because it was basically teenage tinder. But despite that i have a nostalgic fondness of it. I was swiping through one day and saw this hot goth girl and i swiped right. We matched and i had terrible pickup lines back then so i called her a bowl of oatmeal. We traded snaps and talked for a little bit (neither of us realizing that we had a crush on each other). A week later she messaged me crying because her friends had ditched her and gone to the movies. I was trying to be slick and told her that i would take her to the movies if i was there and apparently it workes because we snapped back and forth until 2am. After that we talked as much as we could on snap, all day and night. On my birthday i had to hang my phone up at 10 (i have kinda strict parents) but i couldnt sleep so i stole my phone back and messaged her saying ""sike, i never fell asleep"" neither did she and we never went to sleep that night. I never asked her out and we both just assumed we were dating so ig we really just fell into each others hearts. 4 months later i saw her in person for the first time and it was the best 2 days of my life. We went out for a picnic and talked the whole wayvthere and back, each time she laughed i fell more in love with her and i'll never forget our first kiss in the park. What made it even better is that my parents love her too!! it hurt alot to watch her pull out of my driveway and we both cried alot, but ik i would see her again. AND I DID!! Two months ago i drove to her house and we went to homecoming together. It was an amazing night and i am not ashamed to admit i cried into her chest as we slow danced. I feel bad about it but she days it was cute. My dad is kind strict so i couldnt stay the night and got home at 3am. And now i am going to see her for christmas and after 8 months i think i am ready to give her a ring (just a promise ring not anything too grand). I am buying a hotel so i can be out there for 3 days. I have never had someone make me more happy in my life and i am glad that a gross,weird,sketchy app like yubo existed so i could fall in love with the most amazing woman i know. 

If you read this thanks for hearing my love story and sorry if there are any mistakes"
