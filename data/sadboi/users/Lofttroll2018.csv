BPD,epefszw,t3_bui2ms,1559182192.0,I just started using Better Help. It's OK so far. Definitely better than having no one to talk to. I've been having a hard time getting a new therapist in person.
BPD,epefhw4,t3_bufynm,1559182092.0,Look into ways to deal with rumination. That's a common issue those of us with BPD face. There are exercises you can do to help fight off the thoughts.
BPD,epeel2z,t1_epeczjc,1559181784.0,"Thanks for the encouragement. Relationships have been such a challenge for me, always looking for validation from another person.

BPD,eovd1yz,t3_btandw,1558892882.0,"Just my two cents, but my advice would be to steer clear of this former FP. Any attachments or feelings you have are likely just leftover from before. Basically, they’re like wounds reopened by his return. Do not confuse these for healthy feelings. If he could treat you that way before, he can do it again. Also, he might have apologized but he seems pretty noncommittal about making things work. You know you’re healing and progressing when you can see those toxic people for who they are and know they’re not good for you."
BorderlinePDisorder,eouuw0s,t1_eou5q20,1558881487.0,"I’m glad you’re seeking help. BPD is a real bitch of a mental illness. It often takes a combination of meds, therapy, and hard work.

In a way, you’re detaching yourself from the depressed you and probably doing what the healthy you would do anyway. I’ll have to give it a try. 

Have fun in Vietnam! It’s one of my favorite places in the world (I did my first solo travel there). I should also really think about visiting Australia again (I lived in Canberra when I was in primary school). I still have a lot good friends and memories of there (I live in the U.S.)."
