MakeupAddiction,ewigtzq,t1_ewhowrv,1565448877.0,Omg thank you!!! Been using eye creams since I was 14🤣🤣
MakeupAddiction,ewhnur8,t3_co9m57,1565414526.0,"I couldn’t agree more. I posted a slightly angry comment on one of their IG posts about the horrible service and they literally deleted select comments of mine that made me sound like a total entitled brat. I had a ton of people coming for me😭 
I wish they would invest in better service, because their products are amazing"
MakeupAddiction,ewhmvqj,t3_co5rjp,1565413469.0,I love that shadow shade. It’s such a unique take on the reds we’re seeing a lot right now. Very berry
depression,ewhmr41,t3_co4r6g,1565413327.0,"I do. I think the worst part for me is that it manifests itself in such odd ways. For example, I work in a department store- I’ll become suddenly fixated on a task I can’t possibly complete at work such as cleaning my room, mailing something etc. 
a lot of my friends and family perceive me as somebody that’s high energy, which is true- but mostly because it’s the only way I can get out my perpetual fear/panic in a somewhat healthy manner."
MakeupAddiction,ewhavua,t1_ewh6r4e,1565402689.0,"A mix of things. Anastasia chestnut bronzer, covergirl cheekers in deep plum, and a bobbi Brown pink glow highlight on top. It’s sooo pearlescent I love it"
MakeupAddiction,ewhat7b,t1_ewh5b4t,1565402631.0,Omg- that’s an absolute incredible compliment. Thank you for the love!!!!! Made my day :)
MakeupAddiction,ewgyz6f,t1_ewgys2y,1565393729.0,I would too haha!!! I was afraid of messing it up🤣🤣🤣🤣
MakeupAddiction,ewgs3h1,t1_ewgobls,1565389112.0,I work in cosmetics and they keep giving us that damn mascara!! (No pun intended lol) I have sample sizes and two full sizes. I’m just trying to run through them at this point and use it when I wear thicker liner like this. When it dries out a bit more the brush just flakes and literal particles fall out into my contacts which isn’t cute lol! Pass
MakeupAddiction,ewgcdxp,t1_ewgbbzw,1565378720.0,Thank you!!! I’m one of those people who loves a little clump lol. But it’s mostly from this mascara particularly. I’m trying to give the TF damn girl mascara a fair shot...but it’s a bit clumpy even for me (as seen in photo). It builds way too fast. I’m not sold on it yet
MakeupAddiction,ewgauhu,t3_co6y7p,1565377740.0,"Primer: Anastasia eye primer

Liner: Nyx epic ink liner 
Mascara: too faced damn girl"
MakeupAddiction,ewgalm1,t1_ewc6utm,1565377585.0,Thank you!!! Me too. I’m seriously devastated😭😢 I bought 6 bottles
MakeupAddiction,ewgaj9f,t1_ewawie3,1565377542.0,Omg thank you!!!
MakeupAddiction,ewadvsq,t1_ewa6g5e,1565241653.0,I use all shiseido. Stuff changed my life 😭
MakeupAddiction,ewadt23,t1_ewa4ram,1565241607.0,Absolutely!!! It changed my foundation game so much. Same with putting powder on with the fat end of a damp sponge. Seems like my skin absorbs it so much better. You might like the L’Oréal infallible 24hr foundation. It seems to work for oily and dry. Might be worth it with an extra oil controlling primer
MakeupAddiction,ewa4gjx,t1_ewa2sql,1565236406.0,Thank you!!!!! Is it the matte and poreless one or the dewy one? Also what’s your skintype? I always apply any foundation with a not so dense flat top kabuki and then I go over it with a damp sponge to get rid of any excess powder. I think that loose powder has the best blurring effect I’ve ever seen!
personalfinance,ewa49x6,t1_ewa3g2x,1565236308.0,I don’t either. Thank you
personalfinance,ewa2lwo,t1_ewa02l5,1565235435.0,"It’s a state school, I figured that would be the cheapest around besides community. I’m in one of the best telecommunications programs around, with a minor in English. I feel it’s really worth it for me. 
It’s also way cheaper than it should’ve been because I commuted, 33k isn’t cheap but it certainly isn’t 180k. 
And I can assure you won’t end up exactly in their shoes haha. I left out a lot of the personal details because that isn’t the point of this subreddit."
personalfinance,ewa2db3,t1_ew9y6lp,1565235304.0,"It’s not fair at all, but thank you for the very clear and helpful advice. I truly want the degree very very badly, and I guess fear that I will end up in debt with no direction and stuck in retail for the rest of my life. I have gotten very many valuable experiences out of my first two years and wouldn’t trade it for the world. 
I’ll take this all into account"
personalfinance,ewa1yjh,t1_ew9xqhn,1565235091.0,"You have no idea the situation I am in. I left most of the details out as per the rules of this subreddit.  (I.E this is NOT parental relationship advice) You have not a damn clue of the financial ruin my dad’s mental illness caused my mother, sister and now me. He would pawned off my mom’s own wedding ring to fund his RECKLESS spending addition. The private loans for himself were never seen by my mom or me. In fact we all had no a clue until the loan company informed us. he used all of it to either A. Gamble away or B. Spend on luxuries for himself. He saw himself get approved for my loans and went ape shit realizing he could get his own. I am in a REAL stressful and painful part of my life, asking for ADVICE. Not an ignorant, negative assumptions about me when you are literally getting the slightest glimpse into the hell hole that has always been my parents financial situation. 
Consider your advice unwanted from here on."
personalfinance,ew9vctp,t1_ew9tnod,1565231776.0,"I appreciate the advice. I just can’t imagine doing that. 33k of debt for absolutely no reason, because I know I won’t be able to ever go back if I quit now. I have limited credit but have never missed a payment on anything. It’s just upsetting that I’m being held responsible for my parents reckless decisions. My mother has loans but her credit isn’t ///horrible/// like my fathers is now.....she’s just disputing a delinquent for some work related injury. do you think parent plus would be more likely to approve her if we tried? Or hell, even if I asked for much less just to cover tuition and not my future rent after fall???? I’m not sure why somewhere I swear I saw that parent plus loans are more likely to be approved.....excuse my ignorance and probably slight ramble."
StudentLoans,ew9uuo6,t1_ew9toiw,1565231536.0,It really depends on how good your parents credit score is. if their score is good I would shoot for a private and see if you can get a really competitive interest rate. Nice thing about private is also that you don’t have to immediately pay it back. Just watch it though. I am currently in some serious debt with salliemae and it’s a horrific 12.6 interest rate. Don’t end up like that.
MakeupAddiction,ew9syy6,t1_ew9iq7u,1565230652.0,Thank you!!!!<3
StudentLoans,ew9sd8t,t3_cnemd3,1565230369.0,"You can either take out a private loan (which will most likely require a credit worthy co-signer) 
Or a parent plus loan which will basically fall onto your parents. 

Trust me, I have done everything humanly possible to attempt to get more federal loans"
personalfinance,ew9qxdt,t3_cnf2is,1565229694.0,The only advice I can offer is to never seek a loan from salliemae. You will be paying off what seems like nothing for way longer than you bargained for. Discover loans are more strict with approval but offer a really competitive rate

MakeupAddiction,ew9clre,t3_cn53zi,1565223155.0,You look beautiful! I would actually go a bit heavier on the blush. Maybe a rosy pink tone. I think it would really make your look pop while still being professional!
Damnthatsinteresting,ew99x84,t3_cn5i22,1565221945.0,That’s is somehow amazing and sad at the same time
