depression,fcptlcb,t3_ei5th0,1577871847.0,it’s really sad for me because the whole celebration is for remembering good memories and thinking about making the next year good. that can be so hard especially when you feel like you can’t remember a single good memory and don’t even want to live next year
mentalillness,fce0qz2,t3_eazyei,1577615764.0,you don’t understand how much i needed this. the past week i have been trying to clean my room but every time i stand up to get things done i just... can’t. i feel so numb and empty and at times i’ll even start to cry just because i can’t do it. this gives me so much hope. maybe i can do this.
depression,fcdzc07,t3_eh40gi,1577615338.0,"i can relate to this so much, it always feels like people never really like me, i go unnoticed unless it’s out of pity. hang in there :)"
depression,fc86x8w,t1_fc5rlq0,1577528223.0,"yeah, that really does suck that he disregards only you and not his friends. it isn’t fair to you at all. in his own way maybe he is afraid to show you his worse side because he doesn’t want to lose you, but in that process it is isolating himself and hurting you which isn’t okay. i wish you the best of luck and hopefully this all works out for you :)"
depression,fc550b9,t3_eg8wq2,1577443479.0,"of course your feelings are 100% valid and i understand where you are coming from, i ask understand the other side as well. when i am in a low spot, it feels like too much to talk to people or even text them. it physically and mentally drains me so much not only for myself but i also feel like if i’m not at my happiness i need to fake it or just not talk to them at all. i would say to try and keep positive (easier said than done, i know) and give him time, you never know how someone’s mind works."
depression,fc54r91,t3_eg96v1,1577443104.0,"please don’t hurt yourself. i care and i know many more people in this world, online or not, care so much about you."
depression,fc54hxs,t3_eg9kqm,1577442717.0,"i’m not the greatest for advice because i’m in such a similar situation right now. i know i have problems and i know that i need to get help but everything seems so pointless and hopeless and even though i think about different scenarios where i tell people about what is going on, the thought of actually telling someone is so terrifying that i could never do anything. i just want you to know that you aren’t alone and i completely understand where you are coming from. stay safe :)"
depression,fc4mptv,t3_cml6ni,1577421275.0,"i literally can’t function. everything has gotten hard for me, even just showering or cleaning my room. i try so hard to function right but it just doesn’t work no matter how hard i try. i had a mental breakdown and cried 3 times today because i tried to clean my room. why is this so difficult. i am so sad and numb all the time. what is even happening"
