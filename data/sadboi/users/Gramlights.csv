NoStupidQuestions,fpwdg6j,t1_fpv9e7v,1588961510.0,"That's good to hear!! I actually did get the Fusion 360 personal/hobbyist/startup version for 1 year and started looking up some tutorials and basic functions. So far, putting together even the most simple shapes is already damn fun. 

Thanks for all the tips. It'll definitely get me situated even faster instead of trying to tread blindly!"
NoStupidQuestions,fpumg4o,t1_fpu68ts,1588916887.0,Also got my first 3D printer a few weeks ago and still blown away how cool this thing is. Already have so many ideas lined up but gotta learn a CAD software first!

COVID19_support,fm338q5,t3_fskukv,1585711742.0,"Bruh, I've been doing this all day today. It seems a little dull and weak today so I'm a little scared. No other symptoms."
COVID19positive,flm7qcf,t3_fpgnlb,1585276574.0,"I have the same thing. Started today. It's nothing major at all, maybe a small annoyance at most. Feels like a slight urge to cough. When I do try to cough on purpose, doesn't feel like there's any phlegm or mucus or anything. 

I've had shortness of breath, tight chest feeling, but no fever, no congestion, no big headaches, or anything big. I'm thinking that's because of my anxiety. That comes and goes. We'll see how it goes as time goes by..."
COVID19positive,fllnghu,t1_flke7gk,1585263941.0,Wow.... That is crazy. It seems like loss of smell/taste is prominent in quite a few people
COVID19_support,fl1k0bf,t3_fly61s,1584730524.0,"I'm also getting shortness of breath and chest pressure. Haven't really eaten much. I'm still munching on stuff but a lot less than usual. But to be honest, I'm half thinking it's my anxiety since I do worry a lot about everything, everywhere. 

I woke up feeling super scared today wondering why my throat felt tingly/cold and pressure in my chest but I might've been overthinking it. Realized it was just the cold air. I feel ok-ish right now. 

I feel like the fact that it comes and goes means that it's actually not the virus but who knows... I'll be waiting it out myself too. Hang in there"
