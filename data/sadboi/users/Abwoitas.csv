survivor,fmvlrj5,t1_fmvlm7y,1586421643.0,That doesn't make sense. I'm just saying Ben is the only one to correctly vote for the person that ends up getting eliminated. Doesn't matter what the strategy around it is. Just something statistical I find interesting.

Anxiety,fmg3nn1,t1_fmg3a8b,1586040576.0,"Right but did you read the article? People who could use the rooms aren’t allowed in, and they have to check in to a regular hospital before they’re greenlit to go into the ship. The guy quoted in the article says the ship being there is a joke. I’m hopeful that it will become a great resource but at the moment it’s doing nothing."
Anxiety,fmg2up8,t1_fmg1tei,1586040090.0,"Not to be a Debbie downer; but if you read the second line of that article, or any of it really. You’ll see that’s not a good thing. There’s crazy restrictions for allowing people on it and it’s not because of a lack of people needing care."
Anxiety,fkrz75g,t3_fkayil,1584478971.0,Ya I can't tell which it is. I sleep fine (haven't been woken up by shortness of breath) but I also feel like my inhaler didn't help much. Which makes me believe it's more anxiety.

1) Tarzan would spill the beans to Dave knowing it would burn his relationship with Sharn and Jacqui.

2) Sharn would vote for Dave once, but on the re-vote change her vote! If she voted for Dave again it would've tied again and Tarzan would either have to flip to Dave as well or go to exile himself right?! Why wouldn't she keep her vote the same."

editing,fhydmje,t3_f5dazg,1581973790.0,I would get a local library card and see if you can get access to Lynda.com they have a lot of great basic/beginner tutorials for any and all aspects of post-production. Could be a good start.

MechanicalKeyboards,fep2gem,t3_epyh0m,1579310643.0,So the Ducky One SF has some unique key sizing on the right side. Does that mean that any keycap set I buy won't fit all the keys? Or is there a site I'm missing that will have those custom sizes ready to go?
