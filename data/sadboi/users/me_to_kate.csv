I certainly expect changes to continue - I'm not even done with surgeries, let alone life changes. But I'm no longer stuck as a person transitioning, only. It's no longer the defining element in my life. Now I just want to live as me. While this place is a valuable resource, at least for a time, I need to be clear of the cycle of people beginning their journey. I need to be clear of memories of the hatred and pain I gave myself, until I'm able to know I'm free from it.

As for what I learned - wow. So much. Nothing goes to plan. Nothing goes as you expect. Nothing runs to schedule. You just play it by ear. As much as I struggled, I don't think I'd change my journey. There's too much to go through in a comment - your post was good. I think the main thing is, aside from realising that all those huge steps are the start seem small, looking back, and make you wonder why you found them so hard, is that you are going to change. You're not going to be ""me, but fe/male"".

That's how people die in BBLs (and people do die in them - they have the highest death rate of any cosmetic surgery and it's mostly in the USA, because many clinics inject below the fat for ""greater results"").

I cannot recommend it enough. I can clearly trace the recovery of my mental health to that surgery. I had huge waist dysphoria and in an instant it was cured. Without that surgery, I'd likely still be miserable. 

It didn't cure all my dysphoria overnight - but it was the beginning of my recovery. The moment the hatred started to fade and the self harm started to slow. 

I quite like my body now. It looks female - not just to me but to everyone. I wear bikinis at the pool and I'm *comfortable* doing it. Happy, even. Beforehand, I wouldn't have even gone to a pool. No way."
TransLater,fkqvbo7,t3_fk67ut,1584456333.0,"So I've been commenting and posting here for, like, 2 years? I don't know. Something like that. If you don't know me, I used to be a fairly prolific poster and commenter here, especially in the early days of my going fulltime. Which was in the early days of my transition  - month four of HRT. I had a pretty fast ride. 

Over time, though, this has become my life. And it's been hard - for those who remember me, I've had a history of significant negative self image and that's resulted in me doing things to myself that haven't been good. Often. Very often. 

But now, it's been 27 days since my surgery. That's basically a month, right? A month since I took a huge chance on my body to change something that, to many people, is fundamental to their being. 

I don't know how I felt about ""it"", before. I largely ignored it. I had as little do with it as possible and  generally used it only for absolutely required purposes. I guess what I'm saying is, it was fundamental to my self image - but not in the way it is to most people. It didn't define who I was but rather it defined who I wasn't. It was a negative definition. 

It's been a month now since something else, too. It's been a month since I last called myself a nasty name. A month since I last questioned who and what I am. It's been a month of mental peace. 

I know what I did isn't for everyone. If it's not for you, more power to you. It doesn't make you more or less valid. 

But that isn't my story.

My story is one of knowing my entire life I was a mistake. I was wrong. Flawed. Broken. But now, for the first time ever in my entire life, that's gone. I like me. I like who I've become. I look in the mirror and see a girl looking back. She might be older than I'd like, she mightn't be the prettiest - but she's a girl. And she's me - and that just might do. 

I did what I believed would be impossible. I changed who I was into who I am. I don't even associate with who I was before. That person is a memory like one from early childhood. It's there - but it's faded and darkened and hard to recall. Easy to remember with a photo or trigger but difficult without. 

I told myself when I started transition, I would stay ""me"". The same person with a different exterior. That isn't what happened. I'm not that person anymore. I think differently. I act differently. I process events and other people's behaviours differently. I think about myself so very, very differently. And I, let's be real, sound and look pretty damn different, too.

But now my time here really is coming to a close. As much as I have enjoyed some of the interactions I've had here, the nature of a group that primarily caters to people at the beginning of the journey anchors you to a place that I personally need to leave. It was a time of my life that, for all I needed tk go through it, was full of harmful memories and actions. 

So I wish you all the best in your transitions and hope that for those I spoke to, we managed to inspire each other a little. To reassure each other it's can and will be ok. Because it is. 

I know we don't need to announce our departure, but I did make some friends here I'd like to say good bye to, and I also feel I need to truly let go of the past. I will most likely delete this account in a few days - I've already removed the old posts.

TransLater,fjx9bgk,t3_feo4w8,1583663028.0,"I had vocal surgery a year ago. Unfortunately, you're not going to sound very different after surgery - surgery changes some aspects of your voice but it doesn't negate the need for training.

In fact, due to swelling and the possibility of the use of botox in your vocal folds, following surgery, your pitch may actually be lower for 1-3 months following surgery. Additionally, your voice will be weak for the first month after, as well. 

Please don't assume you're just going to have this perfectly feminine voice after surgery - that won't happen. You will need to train it all over again to work with your new folds but you will be able to achieve a higher pitch and better nasality - but it takes time. Quite a lot of it. The improvements are gradual but real. 

When I listen to myself pre VFS I cringe. I used to think it was ok but it was awful compared to now. 

In terms of major change, I now cannot return to a deeper male voice and trying to hurts. I'm no longer hesitant about using a phone and my voice is acceptable. I'm glad I did it and I'm sure you will be, too."

My experience was pretty good tbh. By and large people treated me as a completely new person, even when they knew better.

TransLater,fj2t292,t3_fawv18,1582953033.0,"Here's my story about hiding things at work and how well it went.

I started HRT in late June of 2018. Really July. At the same time, I'd begun to dress more and more androgynously or rather, better, I also had lost a lot of weight in a short period of time.

I told myself, somewhat accurately, that changes are harder to see when you see someone every day. Also, people see what they expect to - not what's there. There was no finer example of this than three and half months into HRT, I went to a client we'd had for 9 years but whom I hadn't seen in 7 months and they would not let me into their building because no one recognised me (eventually, with some calls, I did get in). On the same day, I went to our datacentre and got the same treatment - my old ID got me rejected.

Yet back in the office, where people saw me every day, no one had noticed. I thought. 

Turns out I was wrong - a new started on her first day pointed out to people that ""a blind person could see I was transitioning"" and that ""she thought I was female at first"". So really, it was the fact that she was someone new - the regulars hadn't noticed. People at work are kind of background - no one takes notice of them.

Now, admittedly, I physically changed faster than most people do, even young people but the result was the same. People who saw me every day noticed little to nothing but strangers or people who rarely saw me noticed quickly that I looked different, I am now 20 months into HRT and if I'm being honest with myself, you wouldn't recognise I was the same person. This video ([https://www.instagram.com/p/B6KQ6YJnsRo/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6KQ6YJnsRo/)) shows me every three months on HRT and as you can see, there's no way in hell I could hide it.

But I hope that helps?"

Transition takes everything we know and hate about ourselves and all those coping mechanisms we had to deal with that (i.e. avoidance) and throws it out the window and instead shines a floodlight on them. We're forced to deal with those thins we couldn't, for so long, but in extreme focus. It's very, very hard.

You will get there but it's a slow ride and a hard journey. I wish you well."
MtF,fj1nt6q,t1_fj0c0mq,1582923930.0,"I understand. And BBL recovery is difficult with work because of the restrictions and how long they are (especially no sitting for six weeks).

transgenderau,fj0b01k,t1_fj06ri6,1582895224.0,"Yeah the process varies. In WA I got change of name first, then passport, with correct gender marker. Then gender recognition certificate and finally with all that, I was allowed to modify my birth certificate."

I then had a BBL - Brazilian Butt Lift or liposculpture. They sucked the fat off my waist and back and ribs and love handles and pumped it onto my butt and hips. 

When I did this, I was already living fulltime and existing but my dysphoria and depression were extreme. I'm talking daily self harm and worse. I can genuinely pinpoint my mental health turning point to that surgery. I went from a lifetime of not being able to see my body in a mirror to seeing a female body and my mental health improved remarkably, from that moment on. 

I cannot recommend it enough, if it's an option and waist is a dysphoria trigger."

In my case, before month four I was being routinely gendered female (41) by strangers but people who know you already don't pay may attention. Never underestimate the power of people to see what they expect to see and to not notice anything outside their own life. 

Additionally, if they see you every day, the changes are harder to notice. 

So in my case, I went fulltime at four months, others faster, but other people may tell you it took years. It's just a ""roll the dice"" situation, I'm afraid. 

The other thing to consider is this: I planned to wait 15 months on HRT and then get whatever surgeries I needed and then come out. But once I started estrogen and it started working, I didn't want to wait. Becoming ""me"" was a very powerful pull and threw all my plans in the bin. And I couldn't be happier."

You know. Imagine if you were.... How hard it must be to live like..... They're just like you and me.... We're all people.

TransLater,fivowys,t3_f9zi3m,1582764829.0,"I hope things go well for you. 

But yes -  as general advise for anyone reading this, PLEASE take that advice seriously. Your voice, no matter what people tell you, takes years to change. Not weeks. Not months. Years. You may be able to effect a higher pitch voice in days but you can't sustain it, you won't default to it when you stub your toe in public and you will look back on it in a year's time and shudder that you thought it was good. While you can train higher pitch in private, you also can't make serious changes until you're using your new voice fulltime, or very close to it. Not to tonality, melody, nasality, etc. So use it *all the time* at home. 

Same for hair removal. Estimate a minimum of 1.5 years. If less, yay - but it rarely is. 

So start these now and take the voice training seriously. Not after getting hrt because you don't know how fast hrt will work. I found myself gendered female and fulltime at four months of HRT, and if I hadn't already been doing the above for months before starting hrt I'd have had a real problem."

Starting on 100mg is a big jump. I started on 25mg then crept up to 200mg in 25mg increments. Just watch standing up too fast etc. But even still, your muscles won't have disappeared overnight. 

Spironolactone is a nasty medication. It works in high doses but it stunts breast development and comes with a lot of side effects. Cyproterone is a better choice if you can get it, especially early on. It's well established spironolactone has negative impact on breast development."

AmItheAsshole,fipuirb,t1_fiprg9i,1582622069.0,"What I'm saying is this is the literal example used in texts to describe toxic masculinity. Literally. Men policing the drinks of other men, on their perceived masculinity. 

The fact that a girl once told you gin is for girls doesn't reduce that. It just means she's absorbed that negative lesson.  

The point is clear - men policing the masculinity of other men is literally one of the definitions of toxic masculinity - and there is no clearer example than how men behave around their friends' drinks. It's forcing other men to fit a specific ""macho"" roll or face ridicule. That drink isn't beer. That dessert is too pretty. That top is too pink. 

And topping it off, the cherry on the top.of the toxicity, ascribing ""female"" as ""less than"". ""That's a girl's drink"" as in, ""that drink is inadequate or inappropriate for a *real* man because I believe it's female and female is lower than male"". 

If you can't work out of that's toxic, I don't know what to tell you."

It's literally the example people use to describe it: men policing other men's drink's level of supposed ""masculinity"". It's like a man ordering a hot chocolate instead of a double espresso - and his male friends mocking him or refusing to order it for him. 

A drink is a drink. People should be allowed to enjoy what they like to drink."

AmItheAsshole,fimhexa,t1_fimgqn3,1582530433.0,"He may not have understood that 9 years ago. 

I need to be clear I'm not taking his side and not discounting your issue. But there's a fundamental difference between sex drying up in a marriage and an open marriage, in societal norms. 

What I'm saying is, he may not understand the impact his lack of action is having on you. That needs to be where your efforts are focused. 

It's possible to sit back and be logical about it and say his lack of action may make you feel rejected and hurt and unfulfilled and even lead to a marriage breakdown. But the reverse is absolutely identical. If you tell him you need sex from someone he's going to feel rejected and hurt and it may lead to a marriage breakdown. The difference is, I'm an impartial third party observer and I can sit back and objectively see the outcomes are actually the same in either direction.

But when this is sprung on him, and there's no way to do this won't be springing it on him, he's not going to react like a third party observer. He's going to freak out. He's only going to see that you ""want an affair"" and it's not going to go well. I mean, I don't know either of you....but it's not. 

I'd advise you to work instead on educating him that you have to have this solved and let him know how you feel but for goodness sakes, do not bring up another man getting involved in anything that resembles early discussions and even then, only if he's made it clear he's not going to facilitate and you decide it's a marriage ending problem (because if you've decided it's worth ending a marriage over not having sex then you've got nothing to lose by asking). 

I truly wish you well and hope it's resolved in a positive way for you."
AmItheAsshole,fimg5ik,t3_f8ndeb,1582528943.0,"NAH. 

You're not the a hole for considering this and he's not the a hope for being asexual. 

BUT. This is going to end in a mess. Sorry but it will. You entered into a monogamous relationship with no consideration of this on the radar and now, many years in, this is almost guaranteed to cause jealousy issues. 

I think discussing the issue and explaining how serious it is to you to have sexual needs met *by him* makes more sense. No one should be pressured to have sex or feel they need to but he needs to understand how much it means to you. There's a difference between not having a drive and hating it. 

As for not catching feels with a regular sexual partner, that's optimistic at best. It might work for a little while but long term, I think it won't. 

You're asking him to change the enite notion of your relationship without skipping a beat. I'm sorry but I think the probability of this succeeding is close to zero."

TransLater,fimfayp,t1_fim4bti,1582527975.0,"No, I've never had FFS and I doubt I will. I'd like it but there's got to be a limit to surgeries and for me to have FFS is starting to cross the line between feminisation vs beautification. I'd still like it, though. I may get the skin under around my chin tightened (threadlifts maybe) as that will define my jaw better and make me look a little younger and isn't expensive and can be done in like 2 hours with just local.

Being transgender, I don't want a breast augmentation because I feel like I want my body to be all me. But the reality is, I'll probably need it. But I'm only 20 months on HRT and they're still growing, so I can't do anything there until they stop growing and I don't know how long that'll be. My dream is that I won't need a BA but I suspect that's unrealistic. 

For hair removal I had IPL. Medical IPL, not cosmetic. That makes a big difference (I.e. It works). I haven't shaved since July last year and it's nice lying in hospital and knowing I don't have beard shadow or growth, to worry about. So I thoroughly recommend it. All up I think 16 sessions or maybe 17? I've lost count. I also did underarms and legs, etc. so I don't need to shave them, either.  I know IPL has a bad wrap but if you get it done medically the intensity is far higher than in a salon (up to 3 times)."

Put it this way - You're going to give people bigger shocks in the future than having longer hair, now, and if having your hair very slowly grow out is seen as a problem, then you've got much more real problems, coming up. 

Don't underestimate how long hair takes to grow. It might seem fast when it's short but shoulder length hair is more than 12 months of growth. Quite a bit more. By not cutting it, you're not going to have ""long hair"" for a very long time - but every time you cut it you're setting your self back. 

I'd advise you to stop cutting it. You seem to have good hair. That's more of an asset than you realise. Let it grow."
TransLater,filjxpw,t3_f8i8d9,1582503319.0,"Here's the thing about people: they see what they expect to see. (Mostly). 

If you wear a slightly baggy top and jeans no one will notice, especially those who know you. Unless your face has feminised to the point where you appear more female than male, your body absolutely won't have feminised to the point anyone is going to question it. At the absolute most, someone might think you have a bit of man boob going on. 

I wore a sports bra and normal t-shirts for the first three-four months of HRT and then went fulltime, because I was getting gendered as female by that time anyway, based on my face. I can tell you that even wearing tight shirts, no one noticed anything other than I seemed to be looking better (lost weight, better clothing choices, etc). 

As I feminised in those first four months, I began to be read as gay at first but not female because people gender in an instant, based of a wide variety of things but predominantly face. Once that's done, it doesn't matter what you're wearing, the mind has done what it does. (That's why people accidentally misgender transgender women in clearly feminine clothes.)

You have to remember that to people who don't know what you're doing, the idea that you're transitioning is so out of left field that it's just not on their radar. So I eventually sort of got to the point of seeing how far I could push it before someone noticed and, in many cases, especially at work, people just aren't interested enough in you to notice anything."
