The thing about PT is that its just that - very physical and requires a lot of trust with your clinician. They really get to know your body intimately and often touch/manipulate/observe in ways that could make people feel uncomfortable. 

If you feel triggered or uncomfortable around him I would recommend finding a new provider. Maybe it would be better to work with a female and put you a little more at ease? I know I wouldn't have wanted a male PT for my sessions.

There are so many loose ends to tie up logistically speaking. Moves, dividing up assets, co-parenting if you have kids. I mean hell my ex and I are still on the same cell pone plan and my car is still in his name. We are on good terms, but if we weren't it would have bee even worse! Even being amicable there have been a lot of emotions on both sides.   


Those 12 months were basically a wash and also you're unpacking a lot of stuff emotionally with the hopes that you won't bring that into your next real relationship. I took the year to chill out. I dated one person immediately after the separation for a few months and it was a mess (but strangely he was the mess - not me despite being the one who was divorcing). 

After that I chilled out hard. Have been on a few dates with friends of friends. Kissed a few dudes for fun, but nothing else.... and I am still chilling. Having fun with my family and my friends and my dog. Leaning more about who I am as an individual. 

 I have no idea what I want in a LTR or what it might even look like for me in the future. All I can say is I'll know what that is when it presents itself. After this last 12 months, my whole perspective on relationships has shifted which is actually pretty cool and exciting.

We waited to file because he lost his job so he is getting health insurance through me until he's back on his feet. I try to disclose that pretty directly but also as time goes on and if things progressed I'd be happy to offer more transparency on the ins and outs of the split up. 

If that's a deal breaker so be it. He is for all intents and purposes my family and always will be. If a new person in my life can't accept that then they aren't the one for me."
politics,ewg4i7l,t3_cntdkg,1565373714.0,I have been an equinox member for a while. I have never seen my gym as empty as I saw it yesterday after work.
datingoverthirty,evzd9a6,t3_clxuub,1564954759.0,Good work putting yourself out there. If a guy approaches me and I'm not in the mood for chit chat or anything I just politely tell him I am flattered but busy at the moment. I know it takes a lot of guts to just go up and talk to someone and I wouldn't want anybody to be discouraged so I always let a dude know hey that was brave and you seem really nice and I think it's cool you put yourself out there (as long as he is nice and respectful in his approach).
datingoverthirty,evmkkgt,t3_ckcucl,1564609319.0,I have just been taking myself out on dates and romantic weekends and spoiling the hell out of myself lately. No real prospects at present!
datingoverthirty,evmikqq,t3_ckd2um,1564608525.0,Don't contact him. In 5 months you will have forgotten all about him anyway!
datingoverthirty,evmia6v,t3_ck8kv2,1564608409.0,"I have one ex who was just so awful I had to put a moratorium on anyone bringing him up or saying his name and if they had to reference him, were only to reference him as ""the other""."
datingoverthirty,eviv0ei,t1_evicbmf,1564549952.0,"This is a great perspective thank you for articulating it this way. I personally do not care to know too much about why people break up as long as they learned from the mistakes (and hopefully they did). I think for me part of the scary part of talking about it is that the circumstances eventually lead me down a path where I sought intimacy elsewhere (aka cheated). So ""on paper"" or to an outsider it looks like the marriage ended because I left him for someone else, when really there is just so much that happened leading up to it and so many nuances that an outside party would never really fully be able to understand. My ex takes a lot of responsibility for his part in things and fully gets why I made the mistakes I made, which is precisely why we were able to both own our BS and come out the other side of things as great friends who happened to share 10 years of life as a married couple."
datingoverthirty,eviu2bi,t1_eviervv,1564549425.0,"You and I are in a very similar boat!  It's funny because I dealt w/his ex wife who is exceptionally difficult and it never really phased me. I'd be thrilled to date someone who is on great terms with their ex spouse. I think it says wonderful things about your character that you are still in their life after the split up! I can also see why some people would feel threatened or feel like ""why didn't you just stay married if you're still so close?"". Guess not everybody will get it and I suppose that just means they aren't the right person in the long run. At our age if you don't have at least a little baggage you haven't really lived!"
datingoverthirty,evhgtpv,t3_cjy60j,1564526143.0,"How long have you all been together?

 I feel like every relationship has a normal cadence to the communication. Hell I text w/my ex husband daily and if we don't hear from each other by dinner time one of us will reach out just to make sure the other is OK. Our communication was constant when we were dating and married. It tapered off when we separated but we're still close so we do at least some meme tagging daily. 

On the contrary, I also had a boyfriend for 3 years that would never call or text literally EVER unless it was a true emergency and didn't use social media- he would just come to my house every day after he was off work or I'd go to his place and we'd hang out and that was just how we were and it worked for us. In retrospect it was kind of great to catch up on each others day  in person and not be texting 24/7. 

Anyway - my point here is you know what's normal for your relationship and when something is up. In the early days of dating I don't think going a couple days without talking is weird but you know in your gut when something is up. 

Sometimes it is good to let someone back off a little if they need that and just wait for them to contact you. Maybe check in to make sure she's OK and once you've done that let her bridge the gap in communication when she's ready. The worst thing you can do is ask for reassurance. If she is working something out in her head she's gona want the space to do just that."
datingoverthirty,ev3kzg1,t1_ev1na1z,1564196850.0,Sound advice !!!! Don’t invite them in or accept an invitation back to theirs unless you’re ready to take things to the next level physically. I’ve found that even if you’re explicitly clear once you cross the threshold people still expect they can change your mind and it can get into some dicey territory.
