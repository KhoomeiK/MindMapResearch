orchids,fq7qi7a,t3_ggg04q,1589150157.0,"👋 hello, I just clicked the join button. 😁

I just realized my orchid (~ 3 years) which I thought was done for but kept around because the leaf was still green. I looked at it today and it had sprouted a root and has a new little leaf coming in! What is the best way to transplant this little guy?

I think I'm going to keep the same pot it is in. It's in a ceramic pot and inside that is a plastic pot that has the holes in the bottom and within that one was another plastic container with no holes where the orchid started in. I took it out of that first container because it's obviously it had no way to drain the water. Thanks in advance!"

I am super excited to see if I can get these to bloom. I have this huge feeling of accomplishment which I haven't had in awhile. They make me feel so good whenever I go out to water them and see them. 🥰 Like hey, look what I did! And it's been the greatest bonding experience with my daughter. She absolutely loves flowers and her plants. That cat grass in the back is hers. She threw the seeds into that one herself. 😄

My cousin and I shared a room and we both have flower names and smoked a lot of weed so we named our room the flowerpot. 😅

So anyway, I absolutely love this!! It just reminds me of those fun wild moments where I had no worries in the world and we could just be young stupid teenagers. 😄"

bipolar,foyn94m,t3_ga9zo9,1588175577.0,"All too familiar! Love it.

Whenever I would have a panic attack like in the beginning of first being on meds idk why but my reaction would always go to wanting to cut my hair. Like not having hair would remove the anxiety. I wouldn't have to take care of it it would be buzzed. (Always thinking the Britney-mentality buzzcut. 🤦🏽‍♀️)

I have an undercut so that has helped the urge of going for the lengthier hair but even then I would buzz down the undercut part with so much frustration and akathisia (during the panic attacks). And because well it's not easy clipping my own hair in the mirror I would always shave it uneven and crooked. My sister in law gave herself a buzzcut during this quarantine and I'm jealous af. 

Nowadays, whenever I ask SO to buzz the bottom he fucking hates it. I can tell by the expression on his face. (The density of my hair has recently changed) but my hair was really thick so having that extra shaved off took a little weight off it. Less migraines. And I love feeling the fresh fuzz. ☺️

So this comment went on too long. Rant over, sorry. 😬😅"

bipolar,fon8bfd,t1_fomhdtv,1587914401.0,"I've been taking it about 2 and a half years or so. Weight gain is the only side effect I'm really struggling with, besides that I like it! I'd love it if I didn't gain the weight back*. I'm the most stable I've been in a long time. My swings are less than they used to be. I'm even hoping to go up another 50 mg if possible. Idk if it will do much if I were to increase but doesn't hurt to try. 

 *I switched to Topiramate for about 6 months or so in between because I was insecure my weight gain but it made my depression worse and even though I was able to lose a lot of weight (I was like 5 lbs short of 200 and dropped to 170) I was having suicidal ideation too often that I asked the doc to switch me back. I wasn't happy anymore it was like I was on Latuda all over again except instead of fat and depressed I was thin and depressed (Latuda was the med I took after being diagnosed and I gained the weight with that one initially)

All in all for me personally, it's been a lifesaver. 😁 Sorry for the long reply. 😅

At first it bothered me they wouldn't do it because I was newly diagnosed but now I kind of get it (sister's moved states and my husband has a demanding job).
