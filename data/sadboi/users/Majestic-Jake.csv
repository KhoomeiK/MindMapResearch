I was similar in the sense of rationally thinking and knowing all of the steps to take but I couldnâ€™t escape this feeling of purposeless. They weâ€™re all on a rock floating through space circling around a giant ball of fire. Whatâ€™s the point, and does it all really matter? The honest answer is no, it doesnâ€™t. Religious or atheist nothing honestly has a purpose, even the after life if you think about it (yes Iâ€™m aware of youâ€™re view). But weâ€™re here, humanity, nature, existence is here. Weâ€™re apart of this experience and play a small part in this everlasting book of it all. Everyone is looking for the meaning of life and the truth is there is none. The only meaning to life is youâ€™re meaning, youâ€™re experience. I highly recommend YouTubing or reading up on depersonalization, Allan Watts is a great listen as well. I hope you get through it man. Life is pretty fucking awesome when you do."
depression,f4p76e8,t3_dl34sk,1571718179.0,"This is such a basic answer but dig deep with it. Change youâ€™re perception. You sound like a rational thinker so think about it, have you tried reprogramming your brain and itâ€™s impulsive thoughts ( in this case depression and suicide) Train yourself to think positive. Iâ€™ve been where youâ€™re at, and me then would have said fuck this comment, but I wish I wouldnâ€™t have, I wouldâ€™ve saved myself many years wasted on thinking about whatâ€™s wrong instead of whatâ€™s right. I get it, why does it matter if youâ€™re alive or dead, and the cliche shit about having so much life to live for gets old but itâ€™s not wrong. Iâ€™ve found depression is in its own way insanity. Repeating the same thoughts, dwelling on the same emptiness hoping something changes, but it never does. I found taking the moment for what it is and all feelings associated with it have helped me (good & bad). Youâ€™re fighting against your own wave instead of flowing with it ðŸŒŠ life is an experience, we have eternity to experience whatâ€™s on the other side, so stick around awhile and live yours."

Usually I donâ€™t take what people say to heart for a list of reasons but Iâ€™ll take that one. Have a good day man. Hopefully Iâ€™ll have that understanding one day. You got a list of books?"

depression,f49bhji,t3_djuv9u,1571461461.0,"That poor man mentality is whatâ€™s gonna keep you in that slump forever my friend. I was in your situation not too long ago. Broke and homeless. The car I had worked my ass off for was fucked and I was living in a shitty trailer struggling to scrape by with my newborn son who had just come into this world.  I lived almost 20 miles from any walking distance stores in the middle of winter. My job fired me as soon as they found out I lost my car. I was fucked to say the least. But than after about a month of running the credit cards dry I decided I was tired of being fucked. I was tired of feeling sorry for myself and I made a way. My way. Not much you can do without a car in the middle of no where. And I, out of all things started a remodeling business. From nothing, with very little prior knowledge (Iâ€™m talking I helped my grandpa hang drywall once type of prior knowledge)  I took the little money I had left ($200) and bought some painting tools and put myself out there through Facebook and Craigslist. I landed my first job 3 weeks later and been doing it ever since. Learning along the way but keeping my integrity and morals with me. Always ensuring I do work to the best of my ability. Iâ€™m about 2 years in and in the past 4 months Iâ€™ve made close to $30 grand profit. Itâ€™s not millions but itâ€™s far from poverty. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and do something about it. Iâ€™ve been through it all. Homelessness, penniless, jobless and hopeless and the mentality of a poor man kept me a poor man until I decided to take matters into my own hands. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s easy because it wasnâ€™t and it still isnâ€™t, Iâ€™m not saying I donâ€™t understand the struggle and am just saying to change it because I know for me itâ€™s easier said than done. I am however saying that as long as you feel sorry for yourself in life and think poor youâ€™ll stay poor. This goes for your finances, your body, and your mind. I gotta give credit where itâ€™s due though. None of it would have been possible had I not chosen to follow the path of God. True faith in the hardest times of your life prove to be most fruitful. Get some faith, get a book, and get to work!"
depression,ezwm6mw,t3_d2pnl8,1568219876.0,"Itâ€™s called depersonalization. I went through it when I was half way through high school ( great timing right lol). Felt like I was a stranger in my own life. I can tell you right now tho it doesnâ€™t last forever and if you stop noticing the differences in youâ€™re life with who you were and who you are today youâ€™ll get past it. I discovered just accepting life as it comes to you helped me tremendously. Living in the here and now and letting whatever flows emotionally come youâ€™re way. Life is an experience and if it you canâ€™t change youâ€™re experience than just live it, because regardless of how you feel we still only have one life and the clock is still ticking."
