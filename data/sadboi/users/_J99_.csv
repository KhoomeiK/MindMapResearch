depression,fr3qxgh,t3_gm1bew,1589863866.0,"I’m so sorry you are going through this. I feel your pain, I’ve been cheated on to. It’s such a horrible feeling. It hurts so much. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I also completely understand what you said towards the end of your comment, it’s so hard to hate someone you gave your heart to. But if she was willing to cheat then that proves she isn’t the one for you. I say that her cheating says a lot more about her than it says about you. If she was willing to completely ruin your relationship over you being sick in bed for a week then I think it’s better she’s out of your life. I think it’s better that you saw her true colors and are now able to leave that situation. Take your time to mourn but also take time to heal. You don’t have to hate her, but you definitely do not have to forgive her or love her any longer. I think it’s perfectly understandable for you to be very angry and I think despite the situation you are managing your anger super well. Take your time to mourn and get back on your feet. It’s perfectly normal to be sad and depressed in your situation. Also please know that you can be loved again, there are plenty of amazing people in the world who are loving, trusting, and loyal. For me that was the hardest hurdle to jump. It’s still a hurdle I’m jumping because I’m still so scared of getting close to people after being cheated on. I’m still healing from my pervious relationship and it was years ago. However with time I was able to feel a lot better about the situation and heal most of the hurt it caused me. I now see that not everybody is a cheater and plenty of people have amazing relationships. Take your time to go through the series of emotions this situation will bring and try to communicate to those you trust and those who care for you. I hope you feel better soon even if it’s just a little bit. My prayers are out to you man, stay strong."
depression,fqua5j0,t1_fqtyk5p,1589654999.0,"No problem man, and I also had a friend group that wasn’t too validating about others feelings and that can be tough. I personally don’t think it’s attention seeking at all to want support, everyone needs support in life regardless of gender. Some people however are confused by negative emotions and don’t really know how to react to them. This can lead to unintended invalidation. In my case, my friends honestly just didn’t really know how to react when one of us were sad and kinda joked it off to release tension which can be very invalidating to the sad person. I’d say find some people who you can trust and be vulnerable with or try explaining to your friends that their actions are hurting your feelings, that helped in my situation. Validating and understanding can be very helpful to someone when they are sad or in pain, sometimes it just takes a bit of practice for people to learn that."
depression,fqtxvai,t3_gkxpfi,1589648208.0,"Being uncomfortable when you’re not miserable seems to be common amongst those with depression. I used to have similar times where I would almost purposefully stew in my depressive thoughts. The way I make sense of it is it seems those thoughts are a comfort zone of some sorts. I felt that if I were to try my best to be happy, I would maybe get disappointed that things wouldn’t turn out the way I wanted. I felt if I was happy I was more vulnerable to being hurt, so I just simply stayed sad to protect myself from the outside world. I’m not sure if you are going through something like that or completely different, but these self deprecation moments can be prevented. For me, I just slowly practiced being more vulnerable. As I did this I saw that not everyone was out to hurt me or make me feel bad. I saw I could be vulnerable with people and still be liked. As I slowly got used to being more open and honest with my feeling (both with myself and others) I was slowly able to stop self deprecating all the time. I still have those sad thoughts a lot, but not nearly as often. Either way I hope you figure out a way to help yourself and maybe feel a bit better. I wish you the best man, keep pushing :)"

I’m not just saying this as someone who wants you to live but also as someone who has attempted suicide as well. I’ve attempted suicide a few times and I 100% understand that hopeless feeling inside that makes you want to end everything. In my case, it felt very sad, cold, and lonely to be alive. But please just know things can change, there is potential for life to get better. It won’t be instant and it can be hard at times, but with enough perseverance you can potentially gain the things you want in life. I’m still on that hard journey but since I have taken steps to help myself I have definitely felt better. Please reconsider your decision."

depression,fptq37s,t1_fptjjsf,1588895999.0,"The way I was able to stop loving my ex was seeing other people’s relationships in life. It was a hard process because I was very attached to my ex but as time went on I learned more and more about relationships in life. As I saw other people’s relationships and pages of other people seeking love; I saw that it was possible to be loved in a beautiful way. Not everybody is mean, abusive, or looking to cheat. There a so many kind loving people with so many different backgrounds, the hard part is to find them. I saw that millions of people have relationships that are kind, loyal, fun, loving, etc. Ofcourse no relationship is perfect, but there doesn’t have to be constant abusive pain. If you are in a good relationship you and your partner will want to work through the issues together even if it brings some pain. You and your partner will go through the hard times and come out with a better and stronger relationship. I saw that I didn’t need to be constantly hurt in order to experience the good parts of love, I just have to find that someone who I’m compatible with. That’s the process I’m going through right now, searching. I don’t really have a direct way to search so I’m just trying to better myself and keep myself out there so when I do find someone I’ll be my best self. It’s honestly still very hard for me to cope with loneliness a lot, but having a better mindset about my past struggles and the future helps a bit."
depression,fpth6wt,t1_fptgtt3,1588891181.0,"I completely understand, I went through a similar situation in the past. Loneliness can be so hard to overcome and giving up feels like the only option. The feelings youre feeling are perfectly understandable in your situation. Just know that overcoming the pain is possible. Maybe time will heal your pain, maybe therapy can help, or maybe enough emotional work and support will help. You just gotta keep trying different strategies until you feel one works. Just please keep trying your best and get help if you need it. I’m rooting for you :)"
depression,fptgms5,t3_gfgbo3,1588890890.0,"I’m so sorry to hear you’re in pain. I get the feeling, I crave love every second of every day. I’m so sorry to hear your previous partner was abusive and hurtful towards you, that pain can be so hard to handle. Loneliness can be such a difficult thing to live through, just know you aren’t alone in this battle against loneliness. I’m so sorry your previous partner put you through this pain. If your previous partner was mean/abusive I think it’s better that she isn’t in your life anymore. She can’t hurt and abuse you anymore. Id say now you can go after bigger and better things, such as new love and being happy with your children. If you want to put yourself out there again and potentially find love then maybe you can try online dating, you can potentially find a loving partner there. Many people wouldn’t mind dating a single parent at all. I know many step-mothers who end up loving their step-kids like they are their own flesh and blood. However if the emotional pain makes it so you are unable to attempt dating then maybe you can visit a therapist to help you get through this trauma. When someone I loved cheated on me, therapy helped me a lot. Either way I hope you feel better soon and I hope you get through this pain. I’m sure one day you’ll find someone amazing and loving to share life with, just keep yourself out there and maybe love will find you when you least expect it."
depression,fptez39,t1_fptdtb8,1588890030.0,"I understand, abuse services may not allow you to stay at your home if they feel it is unsafe so if you don’t want to leave you should probably try other methods to solve this issue first. Maybe you can try talking to your mother about how much her actions hurt you. Try getting a safe person (someone like a close family member who can protect and support you during this confrontation) to assist you and also help you send the message to your mother. Maybe if you mother hears how much she is hurting you she may realize the fault in her actions and want to fix your relationship. If that seems like too hard of an action to execute maybe you can visit a therapist and get some in-depth advice on how to solve this issue."

The pain of being hurt by someone who is supposed to love you is intense, I’m so sorry you’re going through that. In my case I had learn that it was my mother’s own anger that caused her to hurt me and it was not really about me. If your mother is hitting you and causing you to feel suicidal, you should maybe contact abuse services. Maybe they can separate you from that abusive environment or at the very least educate your mother to not hit/hurt you. If you don’t want to go that drastic maybe you can get help from your family to talk to your mother. I hope you figure out a solution and get help soon 🙏"

I’m so sorry to hear you’re going through that, but please know you aren’t alone; millions of us are going through the pain of loneliness. The pain of not feeling good enough for so long has cut scars deep into many of us. Even with all the emotional pain, I like to dream that I find someone one day and I hope you find someone to.

A year and a half later to this present time I’m not sure if I necessarily feel thankful, but life does seem A LOT more bearable now after I fixed a lot of the things in my life. Life still sucks a lot of the time even after being released from a psych ward last year but I don’t think I’m in the state of mind to commit suicide or attempt again. Some thing have been positive but in my case there’s still a lot more to fix. Im not necessarily thankful to be living but I am thankful to the people I care about and those who  care about me. What keeps me going is the fact that I do have this dream of living a good life that I can be thankful for with a loving s/o and I want to try really hard to achieve that dream before thinking about attempting again.

The best advice I can give is to mourn in the way you see fit. There is no wrong way to mourn. I think it’s perfectly understandable to want to hug her and love her again. I think it’s normal behavior to spray her perfume on your pillow to remind you of her, you lost the love of your life. I’m so sorry you have to go through this, I pray your girlfriend is in a good place smiling down at you. I think you should maybe go with your idea of the break. If you need a break from all the concerned looks and chatter about the situation then go on and go somewhere you can have a break. It is perfectly understandable to need a break in your situation. Maybe the break can give you solace in this situation. You can use that time to look inside yourself and mourn. Mourn how you feel you need to. And on a side note, I’m sure your gf parents weren’t lying when they said they felt your gf lived through you. You were her love, you were so special to her. I’m sure your gf parents appreciate and love you so much. I also don’t think you have to hide your feeling away from your loved ones. They would definitely understand if you’re still depressed about losing her. It’s ok to feel weak in this situation. Maybe mourning together and talking can help you both a little. Either way, I pray your gf rests in peace and I hope you feel better even if it’s just a little bit better."

Depression makes everything so difficult at times. I mean when your brain is dealing with something as stressful as depression it’s only natural for it to be mentally exhausted sometimes. What I try to do when I’m feeling unmotivated/exhausted all the time (which is pretty frequently) is make a small schedule for the day. Like I try to be out of bed by a certain time and do hygiene related things by a certain time. Then once I do that I can do the things I like to do like playing video games and stuff. Usually once I’m up out of bed and engaged in something, I can manage the exhaustion a bit better. Also you can maybe try watching some YouTube videos on games to feel some motivation to play. That sometimes works for me. I hope you feel better soon man, I wish you the best of luck :)"

depression,fmxrzyn,t3_fy15sx,1586470733.0,"I am so sorry to hear your situation. Post pardom depression is a very difficult thing to deal with. My mother had postpardom twice and it is definitely extremely difficult and scary. My mother almost committed suicide after I was born and after my little sister was born. I’m so sorry to hear you are in this scary and painful situation. Try not to blame yourself too hard if possible, this depression is almost uncontrollable. I’m sure you’re trying your best. Have you tried talking to a therapist? Maybe with a therapist you can vent some of your intense feelings and get some things off your chest. Also I’m sure your husband understands what you’re going through, postpardom is insanely difficult to deal with and feels uncontrollable. He’s sticking by you because he loves you and knows how much you’re suffering. And by the sound of your post, you really love your husband and child to. If your feeling shameful about your actions maybe try talking with him about it. Apologize for what you feel shameful for and try to talk through this situation together. My mom told me that my dad really helped her through her postpardom by supporting her and being validating. Try your best to spend some time with your child but limit yourself if necessary. Try not to let shame get in the way of being with your child. Maybe your husband can help with the harder responsibilities involving your child like feeding on some days so you can focus on the easier more relaxed part of being with your child such as playtime and relaxation. This can maybe relieve some stress when you’re with your child and allow you to spend some quality positive time with them. Try expressing as much love to your child as possible in this situation. Maybe you can explain to them your struggling but reassure them you still love them very much. I highly doubt your child is angry at you and is probably just confused by your behavior if anything. I would definitely say the best first step you can take to helping yourself is talking to your husband about how your feeling. I’m sure he will want to support and help you. My mother told me having my father help her allowed her to stay relatively stable. I hope you get the help you need and feel better soon. I’m praying and wishing you the best of luck :)"

This whole covid virus has turned the world completely upside down. I don’t think anyone saw it coming. Is it possible you can leave your current job? Since you are in a high risk area it can be dangerous to stay. You still have that reapplication to the program and you still have dreams you want to achieve.

If he opens up to you maybe you can try helping him out, I’m sure he would appreciate the kind gesture. Or if the situation is to much for you to handle, suggest him to get professional help.

I was in a similar situation except for me it was being very underweight (I was anorexic for a long time). How you feel about your body is definitely a LARGE part of your mental health. Those people who are hurting and making fun of you for your weight are honestly just plain wrong and mean people. You should never be hurt or patronized because of your body. Everybody has different faces and different bodies. I’m so sorry you are being bullied like that, I know how much that hurts. Poor body image can lead to lots of anger and sadness. I was often ridiculed for my extremely weak stature and displayed rib cage. I ended up becoming an extreme self harmer. People can just be so mean, but please remember there are also tons of nice people to. People who can accept & love you for who you are and support you. Also try to keep your emotions stable on the journey to getting fit, if that is what you choose to do. If you like your body don’t let anybody tell you to change it (unless it becomes a health hazard and it is necessary to change like in my case). I think it’s a good thing to want to get fit, but at the same time I definitely know the struggle of getting there. I was unable to gain/muscle weight for years and was basically a skeleton. For me, the key was to keep working at it little by little. I slowly put more food on my plate and slowly exercise more and more. I think in the case of losing weight, trying to let go of a lot of food would be very difficult to do in one shot and working out insanely hard without any basics would also be very hard. Maybe you can try eating a little less food every week and if you slip up once in a while, that’s ok. Comfort eating is a very difficult thing to let go of and it’s difficult to leave your comfort zone. Just keep trying little by little. Maybe try replacing some less healthy food with semi healthy ones little by little throughout the week and experiment with healthier options so you can still comfort eat in a sense but healthier (maybe you’ll like some healthy food, I was surprised at how good they can sometimes be). Also try some basic exercise routines at first and then move to more complex muscle building ones. I used a free app that was able to have you put in your height and weight and then make a routine for your body type (it helped me tons! I think it was called 6 pack in thirty days, but had basic routines along with 6 pack routines once you advance). Just keep trying man! With enough work you can definitely accomplish your goals. And remember when it comes to your body image (like the things you said about your face and weight) are all subjective. You may think those things, but remember that usually you are your own harshest critic. I’m still on the road of feeling better about myself physically, but with consistency and practice I’ve definitely felt better. I hope you find ways to start feeling better soon and try your best not to listen to the negativity people are giving you (I know it’s difficult but please try). And when it comes to your family try explaining how much your body image has impacted your thinking and how much their criticism is hurting you. Hopefully they apologize for their actions and begin supporting you on your journey to improving how you feel about your body. I hope things get better for you soon man :)"

Maybe you can try getting help from a professional? Someone you can trust to help you. Please try everything you can before attempting to end it all.

depression,fmfv9nf,t3_fv0csi,1586035565.0,"Hey, I’m so sorry to hear you are in pain. I honestly went through a similar situation when I was in high school (I was in 11th grade when shit rly started getting bad). I completely understand how hard it is to balance school when youre miserable every day. Grades start slipping and life gets very stressful. Maybe try contacting your school with your mother and explaining your situation. If you are depressed every single day and struggle with anxiety issues, I’m sure your school would like to help if they can. It sounds like you really want to do good in school and graduate, I think that’d definitely make the school want to help you. Maybe try going to a professional for a diagnosis if you haven’t already. Once I got my diagnosis for severe depressive and anxiety disorder, my mother contacted my school and along with my doctor; assisted me with getting back on track. They helped excuse some absences if I was at doctor appointments and were very fair with makeup work. School is very important but obviously so is your health. I hope you feel better soon :)"

Hope things go well for you :)"
depression,fmfu22w,t3_fv0eil,1586034846.0,I’d say therapy can definitely be one of the answers to helping yourself.

What I learned is that depression doesn’t have a time frame to be solved. Try to help yourself in the way you see fit. Try the absolute best you can, that is always enough when you’re going through something like depression. You have to keep pushing until you manage to get out of bed and then maybe next brushing your teeth and then maybe later accomplish another goal. Take baby steps if necessary, it’s very hard to handle all the issues at once. Do what you can when you can and it’s ok to have some off days.

depression,fm1y4tn,t3_fsg8zk,1585687123.0,I’m so sorry to hear about your situation. I also had a very deep bond with my cat to before he died. Someone in my family also has Alzheimer’s and I know how hard that can be to deal with. I’m so sorry to hear you’re in that situation. It’s as if the person you once knew disappeared. One thing I did learn is feelings don’t fade easily even with Alzheimers. Emotions for a loved one can still be deep in their heart and just very difficult to acknowledge and access for the person. Your cat may still have that love for you deep in its heart and just has no memories to correlate. Try reestablishing the bond with your cat and begin the relationship anew. Lovers have also been known to fall back in love even after one is affected by Alzheimer’s. I hope things get better for you and you cat soon.

Once I got out I felt so behind everyone else in life, I felt I couldn’t ever recover. I did lots of therapy and with time my internal wounds began to heal little by little. I’m still working on myself, but I think it’s possible for anyone to eventually feel a little better. Maybe you can try talking to a professional or experiment with strategies that can help you feel even slightly better.

depression,flzwkon,t1_flzvr9n,1585635909.0,"Well if you bring up the crime rate then I’d say look at their position. African Americans were oppressed for a very long time and forced to live in poverty. And it isn’t just black people who destroy and commit crimes. A vast percentage of the crime rate is also done by other races. I don’t think it’s race that correlates with the crime rate, id say it’s environment and upbringing. People in poor neighborhoods would def have a higher likelihood to commit more crime since in some cases they already feel like the whole system of government is against them and they probably didn’t have the resources to have a good upbringing. However even then, a vast % of people in those less wealthy neighborhoods are honest good people and not criminals in the slightest. I would say no matter who you are whether your black, white, Hispanic, etc; if you are placed in a run down place with very difficult barriers to cross in terms of improving your own well being and overall living, you would probably be more inclined to be a criminal and hurt others. I don’t think it comes down to race, I think it comes down to a persons’ position and how they were raised to act upon it. But I’m not here to argue racial disputes or alter your thinking. If you dislike your hometown then by all means do whatever you need to do to leave that place and lead a life you will be happier in. If it feels to difficult to manage that on your own maybe try talking to someone about your issues or seek professional help.

depression,flzulh7,t1_flztzt7,1585634056.0,"The “this” I was referring to was the current virus that is putting most countries into panic, sorry if my wording made that a little unclear😅. And also I don’t think you should dislike the entirety of black people. Black people are people just like white people and any other race/ethnicity. They struggle through things such as poverty and sadness like the rest of us. Sure some people of every race/ethnicity can be bad people, but they aren’t all bad people. I live in the suburbs as well and yeah they can be pretty rundown with old buildings and dump yards, but it also has nice stuff usually. Like cool places to explore and plenty of good people. I’ve met plenty of good people (black,white,etc) around my area. Sure there are some mean people to, but I don’t focus on them because they only bring negativity. If you dislike your hometown so much I guess you can try working hard to make money and move away. Idk if you’re in school or not, but if you are try to graduate so you can get a good job and move out when you can. You can also maybe try acquainting yourself with people around you. Maybe see that people aren’t so bad and maybe meet some cool people along the way. I hope you start to feel better soon man"

Im a former self harmer and a suicide attempt survivor, but life still feels so painful and evil. Although this way of thinking may be a result of my mind being overly negative, it still hurts inside. But even with all this internal sadness and pain you feel; please don’t let go of hope. Even if you have nobody who cares about you now, there is still a possibility of finding people who will in the future. I like to think that one day I’ll find my tribe and be surrounded by people who love me and whom I love. Try keeping that hope for as long as you can, no matter how gut wrenching and hard it can be.

I’m American as well, but although there is some bad in our country you just gotta ask yourself which country doesn’t have some bad? We are human beings, we are flawed creatures. We have the capability to be pretty bad. However, we also have the capability to be pretty good. I like to think of it like this, with every bad attribute come up with a good one. For example, greedy business men in America are the bad while someone like let’s say Martin Luther King Jr is a good. Adolf Hitler of Germany id say is a bad, while Albert Einstein who is also German is a good. I think all places have their goods and bads. It’s how we choose to react and move forward that really counts. People can change which also means countries and nations can to. Honestly the state of the whole world is in chaos because of the current virus, however everybody is trying their best to combat this. Hopefully once this all blows over we can all continue to focus on the continuous reworkings of our governments and making the world a better place for all people."

depression,fl6586j,t3_fmfemk,1584854856.0,I say report him to the police. He is physically and emotionally abusing you. You have proof (your marks) to show the authorities. If you don’t think the marks will be enough try getting recordings/other evidence. However I think a simple display of your markings will be enough because obv that is a very serious thing. Your brother is also evidence as he is a victim to. Child services will probably make it so he has 0 custody of you and your brother. At bare minimum they will make it so he can’t ever hurt you like that again.

Whatever sadness is making you feel the need to end your life can be healed. It may take blood, sweat, and tears but it can be healed. It may never be forgotten but you can change your life for the better. You can make living slowly more and more bearable. I 100% get the feeling of wanting to end it all and do not blame you for seeing it as the only way out. I’ve had, and if I’m being honest still have, those thoughts. But I’m pushing because I’ve seen what a little hope and work can do. My life isn’t peachy but it is more bearable since I’ve really worked on helping myself. Suicide doesn’t have to be the only option. So please just keep that in mind. All of us struggling care for you and I’m sure you have others in your life who care as well.

When I’m feeling very depressed I can’t really do anything to take care of myself and I end up gaining lots of weight. People who are being rude and inconsiderate just don’t understand your situation and don’t realize they aren’t helping by being rude/inconsiderate, if anything they are making it worse. Try to tune them out and maybe start a small workout routine if you want to lose weight. Losing weight is a hard thing to do (I’m actually trying right now since I’ve been living pretty unhealthy lately), but it is possible. Don’t beat up on yourself if some days you don’t manage to do it, just keep trying. It’s perfectly understandable to feel upset in your situation, but there are ways to help yourself. You’ll eventually get better and better. Honestly working and losing weight was a very accomplishing thing for me and made me feel pretty good."

I was a very frequent self harmer, I stopped for a while and then everything went to shit again. I started cutting even more. But eventually with some help I was able to get stable again. A trick that worked for me to slowly inch off of cutting was giving myself the stimulus from self harm without actually self harming. I started using an ice pack and a red marker to simulate cutting. You put the ice on your wrist to feel the sharp cold and then use the red marker for the visual sensation. It sounds odd, but it worked for me. You get the visual stimulus in the form of the marker and the sharp pain of the knife with ice. It doesn’t always work, but it can help. Other than that I would say try your best to structure yourself so you are always doing things and don’t have time to cut, but that WAY easier said than done. Either way I hope things get better for you man, emotions come and go."

But feeling pain and responding to it is not childish. Although hurting yourself isn’t the best thing to do, it is far from childish. You’re hurting inside and feel the need to respond. I know you said you didn’t want advice, but try finding other ways to feel “happy” if possible. Once I found a couple things that were semi tolerable to do I was able to quite self harm and drugs. It’s a hard/long process, but in the end you’ll feel a little better. Find other ways to respond to the pain. Either way man I hope you feel better soon🙏"
depression,fjofq33,t3_fejg8j,1583526839.0,"I believe when battling depression life can feel like net-negative. For me life feels tortuous everyday and I hate every second almost. However, from what I’ve understood from others is that life is pure neutral. Positive/negative times can’t be quantified until the day you are dead. Some days you may feel bad, some days you might feel good. Maybe your average of being happy is higher than sadness for a few years. Maybe your average of negative feelings is higher for the next years. Or maybe it’s scattered around more randomly. The way I try to think it is that you can’t quantify feelings. They’re are just to random and unpredictable. You simply don’t know what going to happen and how long your going to feel a certain emotion"
depression,fjof1lm,t3_fedwbi,1583526449.0,I’m so sorry to hear that. You were only looking to be validated and empathized with. That is a totally normal and legitimate thing to do when someone is hurt. Your mother should not have tried to downplay your hurt because in all honesty that does absolutely NOTHING positive. She should’ve tried to empathize with you and comfort you. No pain is worse than another because pain is all relative to a person. Nobody should downplay another’s pain because they aren’t in that persons body/mind. They don’t know how you are feeling inside and how much you are hurting. I would suggest explaining to your mother how much her comments and comparisons hurt you or seek someone else to talk to about these things if your parents just refuse to understand.
depression,fjodyct,t3_feel0k,1583525830.0,"I’m so sorry to hear you were invalidated like that. It’s very surprising to me that professionals do this to their patients and it’s even sadder because this is common in many hospitals as well as psych wards. It’s borderline cruel and completely ineffective. A persons sadness is like grief and is different from person to person. Nobody can analyze what a “correct” reaction is or a “correct reason” to an emotion. Emotion brain science is not perfect in the slightest and the way that some people react to things more strongly than others is a phenomenon that is very factually supported by science. That doctor had 0 right to label your grief and panic as attention seeking. Insulting a patient in such a way only makes things worse for the patient. I don’t blame you at all for being upset, that doctor should honestly be removed from their position of handling patients. Just know that you never need to feel as if what your feeling is wrong, the point is you feel it and only when you accept what your feeling is when you can heal"

Try giving yourself as much time as possible to see if things get better. Keep doing what you’re doing such as opening up with friends and doctors. Try doing your fav hobbies (even if depression has sapped most of the joy) and take care of yourself physically. Those 2 things helped me stay somewhat stable when I was in that hard place.

Everything I used to do, such as video games and reading were all nothing to me now. I just couldn’t do anything. I felt so numb and most at school and in any social interaction. I felt like such shit because I felt nobody could like someone who was as uninteresting and fucked up as I was. As things went on I tried doing little things to help myself like maybe go out once a week and try brushing my teeth. Eventually my livelihood came back. I slowly regained myself and got my interests again. I was able to laugh with friends and smile. I was able to play video games again. It took a while but I managed to get my humanity back. Sure I still have everything else that comes with depression to deal with but atleast I regained my humanity. Point is the desire comes back with time, your mind heals. Don’t give up :)"
depression,fi9au86,t3_f757xn,1582260053.0,"I think you should express this to him. He seems to have ended things for your sake, he feels he can’t give you what you want. But it seems what you want is him. Having someone who cares for you and doesn’t mind facing your weaknesses with you is a blessing. I think you should tell him how you feel and that you don’t care if he has depression. Tell him you can work through it together"
depression,fhwx4nm,t1_fhwwwex,1581934796.0,"I think you should express to her how much you truly care about her, but at the same time tell her you need some time to think about your feelings. I think she would understand, feelings can be very complicated and eat you alive sometimes. If she knows you care and that the issue is something inside of you then she should understand and give you that time to think about your feelings"
depression,fhwwz81,t3_f56gor,1581934572.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that man. Breakups can really suck. I also dealt with an unsupporting family during my hardships and I know how much that hurts. Just know you aren’t alone man, many of us are here with you. I think it’s healthy to vent a little and then once the emotions are all out you can try to re-stabilize."
depression,fhwwuj8,t3_f56i98,1581934375.0,"I’m so sorry to hear you are suffering. I have a form of PTSD as well and I 100% understand the feelings you are having. In my case I became very detached from everything and wouldn’t eat, talk, or sleep. Trauma effects people in many different ways and that is perfectly normal. Don’t beat yourself up that you’re feeling this way, its perfectly understandable. Have you sought help from a professional? I know that sounds like something everyone would say, but a good psychologist/therapist can really make a difference in your thought process about these situations and make the PTSD effects more manageable. That’s how I managed my trauma and now it’s much more manageable. It’s still hard to deal with, but not as hard. Either way, I hope you feel better soon."

depression,fhwwhfs,t3_f56kl6,1581933837.0,I know the feeling. Having depression can cause major detachment from everything. The only piece of advice I can really give is try to push through (obv easier said than done) because eventually the detachment drifts away for a bit. You say you have a gf who you love and who loves you; so I would recommend talking with her about this detachment. She will probably support you and be there for you during this hard time. Also maybe try explaining to your family that depression isn’t something you can just snap out of. I hope you feel better soon man
depression,fh5wugj,t3_ezx7tp,1581293042.0,"I’m in the same boat tbh. I always feel unworthy of love and constantly crave it. I have these horrible thoughts that make me feel worthless and horrible. But the way I’ve coped with it is the fact that our future is honestly uncertain. Will we find love? Honestly as much as my gut says I won’t, I really don’t have the faintest clue. The future is uncertain and that is a fact. Nothing can deny that, not even our depressing thoughts. For all we know we can find someone who really likes us and loves us. Or maybe not. The fact of the matter is the future is uncertain so we might as well do things to make the future we want more likely."
depression,fgud7nm,t3_f0hion,1581117962.0,"I’m so sorry to hear you feel this way. I do not have the same experience with my mother, but I know people who have. My own mother was a product of the curse, but she was able to break it and truly love me and my siblings. It’s not impossible. Maybe you can try talking to your mother about these feelings you have and see how she feels about it. This can get you some closure on the situation and maybe bring you two closer. But just know the curse isn’t inevitable, you can be a different mother. You don’t have to be what came before. You can be what you want to be, especially as a parent. It’s your choice how you raise your children, nobody else’s."
depression,fgucqvb,t3_f0hv2r,1581117650.0,"I think that is normal, if one member has depression in a relationship it can be an emotional rollercoaster. Your boyfriend’s misunderstanding and emotional outbursts, although may not have been the correct thing to do, can be understood. I would suggest bringing up this topic with him in a non-hostile way. Maybe tell him how you felt hurt when he made you feel alone. This gives him a chance to explain his side of the story and give you closure. Talking about this in a healthy way can definitely get some of this hurt off your chest."
depression,fgucd6z,t1_fgubvwk,1581117393.0,"Well if he isn’t even hearing out your explanations then that’s a bad thing. He shouldn’t be expected to understand everything about your feelings, but he should atleast try to and if he can’t atleast understand that depression hurts you and that you aren’t just attention seeking. If he doesn’t have depression and doesn’t understand the feeling that is fine, but as your SO he should still want to be supportive in any way he can. Depression isn’t just a facade people make up, it’s been scientifically proven to exist in the mind and is shown to be very fatal if not treated properly."
depression,fgubx9t,t3_f0hv4u,1581117096.0,"I’m kind of in the same place. The way I cope with it is that I honestly don’t know the future. I can’t know if I will never be loved, who knows if I will? For all I know I will find someone one day, and maybe I won’t. The truth is the future is uncertain, dwelling on possible futures that may or may not ever happen isnt always healthy."
depression,fgubm84,t3_f0hvn6,1581116890.0,"I would suggest bringing up the topic of his discomfort. See why he feels uncomfortable, maybe there is a justifiable reason for it and you can work through it together and grow closer. Explain to him how his discomfort makes you feel. Maybe there a good reason for his discomfort that you can understand. Also explain to him that you would like to be able to emotionally confide in him if possible, and hear out his reply. Maybe he just feels upset at the idea that you re depressed, and maybe needs to open up himself to. Make sure you bring this up in a calm, chill mannered way so the discussion can be a productive one"
depression,fgub15c,t3_f0hzms,1581116503.0,"I think your anger is very justified. She kinda invalidated how you felt in the past and made it seem as if because you didn’t commit suicide than your feelings about wanting to do it weren’t real. However, it is possible your girlfriend is just not experienced with depression and really has no idea what it feels like. I doubt she meant to hurt you and just doesn’t understand the feeling. I would try explaining to her how what she said made you feel angry, and then work through it."
depression,fguagi2,t3_f0i93u,1581116122.0,"I wouldn’t say grieving makes one better or worse at handling things. Grief is one of the most complex emotions in human biology and coping with grief can be hard. Like you said your laughter is a coping mechanism, and breaking down happens. Your sister just handles grief differently and doesn’t break down as hard. That’s neither a positive or a negative, it’s just a trait she has. Just because you grieve as certain way doesn’t make you less or more of a person. I think as long as your family understands you have a hard time grieving then everything will be seen as normal. People grieve differently and that should never be seen as a fault. Grief is a hard emotion"
depression,fgsylko,t3_f0ai93,1581095353.0,"Well it seems you have two issues

For losing weight I would suggest doing small work outs and slowly moving up. That’s what I did when I needed to lose weight. It only takes 20 minutes per day and there are many apps that help give specific exercises. You can even do it in your own house if you don’t have time to go to a gym. I’ve been doing it for around 30 days and along with that and a healthier diet I have lost 6 pounds already.  

But the 2nd issue which I think is more important is the interaction with your family. The fact that they shame you is not beneficial to anyone at all, especially you. You should try expressing how their shaming makes you feel and how much it hurts. Tell them you want to try and lose weight and that their shaming makes it so much harder. Hopefully your family will understand. 

I hope things get better for you man, good luck with everything"
depression,fgsxjrq,t3_f0bj16,1581094724.0,"As someone who has depression as well, I would suggest just being supportive. Sometimes trying to solve the situation can be more hurtful than helpful. As you said depression isn’t just something you can snap out of. It is a very complex emotion. Your wife may just want to feel as if your there for her. When she’s depressed try saying things like “I know you’re feeling bad, but just know I’m here if you need to talk or anything”. The feeling of support definitely helps A LOT. As long as she isn’t hurting herself or others you don’t have to take drastic action. Being supportive can go a long way. Also try doing small things that make her happy, maybe making her coffee in the morning before work (if she’s into that). Just be supportive and caring, and try to stay calm. Then if your wife starts to open up about things that make her feel depressed make sure you validate her feelings and not try to problem solve (unless she asks for it). Searching for a soloution without truly hearing and feeling your wife’s words can do more harm than good. Support can go a long way, especially in a marriage"
depression,fgswshf,t3_f0bqkw,1581094278.0,"Don’t discount your feelings because it’s high school. Death is a devastating thing no matter the age. I’d suggest being conscious of your feelings rather than avoiding them, no matter how hard it may be. Try thinking of the good times with your girlfriend and try to take care of yourself, if not for yourself do it for her."
depression,fgnf1xl,t3_ezcd1s,1580943488.0,"I’m so sorry you felt it needed to end like this. Hopefully you survived to read this, but I know where your coming from. Suicide sometimes feels like the only way out. But just know it isn’t, there is always room to fix your problems no matter what state of mind you’re in. It’s never impossible to turn back. It’s never to late. I overdosed for probably the same reason you did, I felt I couldn’t ever be happy. But I survived my suicide attempt and since then I went to therapy and worked on myself. I’m nowhere near happy yet, but I’m getting there. It’s never to late to start helping yourself. If you survive from the pills I hope you find a way to turn your life around. If you end up passing from an overdose may you Rest In Peace."
depression,fgei52z,t1_fg68rdc,1580700051.0,"I would not say the act of oppressing and being racist is created from your race. If you look throughout history all races have done things that fall in those categories. Racism and oppression is not caused by a race, because you can’t classify people by just their race. The pigments of our skin really come down to genetic heritage of ancestors and does not effect brain development independently. Although members of certain races may have been inclined to or are still inclined to raising their offspring to be oppressive and racist; It’s not the skin color itself. If you look at history each race has its heroes and villains. For example white people have a villain in Hitler who started WW2 but a hero in Salk who cured polio. Black people have a hero in MLK jr who skyrocketed the civil rights movement, but a villain in African warlords who enslaved their own people and began the slave trade with Portugal and the U.S. Each race has their own hero’s and villains because in the end human nature doesn’t come down to solely race. It’s how you are raised, what you grow up surrounded by, and your own core beliefs. I wouldn’t beat myself up about being a certain race. I’d focus on being a good, kind, and healthy person"
depression,ffneckh,t3_etkvgj,1580064844.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that. As a person who also struggles with insecurity based on my looks and personality I definitely understand where you’re coming from. But honestly nobody is truly ugly. There is definitely someone out there, probably many people, who think your an attractive and awesome person. This “friend” who purposely targeted your insecurities even after you told him you wouldn’t take it well shouldn’t be the only say in the situation. His opinion is one of millions. And you also have to remember people are generally the harshest critics towards themselves. What I mean by this is that people usually judge themselves harsher than others would. I hope you start feeling better soon🙏"
