UniversityOfHouston,fppr20t,t3_ged70l,1588807501.0,"I really think you will need a car. For some reason there are really good deals on cars in Spring (a city just north of Houston). You can also search for cars with hail damage - they have salvage titles but the engines are usually fine. 

If you could get an apartment below your range you might be able to get a loan and make payments from the difference. 

The summers are stifling and outside will take your breathe away. I've lived in a lot of humid locations and Houston is by far the hardest for me to deal with. If not for that I would say Houston is my favorite city. 

People are generally kind and helpful. There are a lot of chill places around if you look in the nooks and crannies of the different districts. Downtown is the easiest to navigate. 

I live an hour south of Houston and the commute is worth it  for me."
UniversityOfHouston,fouoi88,t1_fostt8n,1588087750.0,Totally agree. However if it's an unnecessary class for your degree path then it may be a non issue anyway. I would talk with a faculty advisor or even the teacher of the class before proceeding either way.
UniversityOfHouston,fos6v6a,t1_fos4vrn,1588025038.0,"I completely agree.  However, if it's 3 years from now, the memory of how impactful this situation is may fade a bit.  I think you're right, and we should expect an admission committee to take this into account, but I personally don't leave anything up to chance."
UniversityOfHouston,foryum9,t3_g96aui,1588020907.0,"Are you planning on grad school?  I emailed a teacher to ask their advice and they told me that if you take p/f in only one class, the admission committee will notice that.  I think I would take p/f if that means it will transfer, but just be ready to explain why you struggled in the class (Covid-19; F2F class went to online; stress levels etc).   


Either way I think it doesn't matter and a lot of professors seem to be giving their students some leeway as they understand the stress this has created."
TalkTherapy,flu42w9,t3_fqxgxo,1585494763.0,"I didn't think I would like the telehealth very much but I actually love it.  I use headphones so I don't have to talk very loud lol.  


I have a friend (ok, almost all of my friends and I have the same therapist.  I don't know how she does it) who has to do her sessions in her car so her mom won't hear her bitching about her LOL!  


Anyway, I do encourage you to try it out, even if you do it less often."
uhcl,fllnd77,t1_fll9kri,1585263887.0,"I completely understand how frustrating it has to be for the teacher dealing with this too, right? It's understandable that there would be delays and hiccups. Some of my classmates are taking both versions of this class and said their other class is not this complicated. 

Oh well - I have some really great teachers. I'm hoping that by next week things will have a chance to smooth out. I was just trying to gauge whether I was overreacting.

Thanks for letting me vent. I hope you have a smooth semester from here on!"
uhcl,fll2rcj,t1_flkwsaz,1585252532.0,"It's a research methods and statistics class. Every time I email, I'm told the teacher will have something done by a certain time and it isn't getting done. I am in contact with other people from the class and many are feeling the same as I am. 

I'm taking screen shots of my screen though and am going to compare those with the emails to show that the professor never followed through if I get a bad grade. I am willing to appeal any bad outcome but it's so stressful in the meantime. 

I just wish they would communicate better. Like even a ""still working on it, sorry for the delay "" would be appreciated."
ptsd,fjodfpn,t1_fjn1ul0,1583525535.0,"Hey so do you have a therapist or an advocate of some sort? I have learned through a friend that most hospitals in metropolitan areas will have a social worker who will at least know someone who can help you if not. You describe some issues here that need some assistance. I mean don't get me wrong I think most of us with PTSD need a little metaphorical handholding but what I just read is a safety issue for you. 

Sending you all the vibes to lift you up."
CPTSD,ffwljoz,t1_ffvtgst,1580304763.0,"That's some sound advice. I have been sitting on this for quite some time so it won't hurt me to mull it over some more. Writing a practice letter is a fantastic idea, thank you so much."
CPTSD,ffwlefu,t1_ffvhmnc,1580304645.0,I guess I don't know what would help. The guy had dropped off the planet for a decade or so and I never felt the need to tell my dad. But now my dad is going to visit him across the country etc and I'm like dammit stop doing that- he's a bastard. So ugh... I told my step mom sorta... I dunno maybe I'll talk to her again and see what she thinks.
college,ffpgsy3,t3_eu9gt8,1580094686.0,This may sound counterintuitive but you should probably just drop some molly with some people one time and you will from that point on be able to speak of the deepest and most meaningful things with them.
college,ff38ax3,t3_eqx8h9,1579536060.0,"I work at a CC. This is what you need to do:

Fill out a FAFSA online. Choose the community college nearest to you to have your information sent to. Do this ASAP!

Fill out an application for your CC of choice.  

Look at their website to see what requirements they have. Here in my state there is a state exam required and plenty of online studying options for it. 

Call the academic advising office and set up an appointment. You do NOT need to be enrolled to do this. It helps if you've submitted your application though so they can keep track of what you need to do. 

Call the financial aid office at your chosen CC. Ask them what you need to do in addition to filling out a FAFSA.  Ask where you can find scholarships. 

I believe you will qualify for grants and other forms of aid. Get the ball rolling now so you are prepared for the registration date. Then you get your pick of classes. 

Fee free to pm me if you have questions."

uwyo,fdx46c6,t1_fdw90yf,1578765138.0,That's good to hear! She's pulling approximately a 3.5 after her first semester but she's just getting the hang of high school. It seems like she's starting to get a little better at managing
CPTSD,favy2e7,t1_fapheuw,1576363498.0,Yes. And he says he will go but I think it would take me doing all the planning and right now tbh I'm not feeling up to it. I'm just tired from dealing with my own stuff. I know this needs to happen... I just have to get the courage/strength to do the work.
CPTSD,fap9vmp,t1_fap9ii2,1576283600.0,Man its rough! It's not super terrible - I'm just willing to look at my behavior and just see it as behavior but he has a difficult time with a distant perspective. I can bring something up and he'll get pissed but a few days or weeks later he will say something that let's me know he's thought about it. He's not able to talk about his own contributions to issues very well but I'm just going to keep working on things and hope he keeps following me. It's just in the meantime it's complicated as heck.
CPTSD,fap6cuy,t1_fap62zs,1576280985.0,Definitely. As weird as it sounds I think I am much further along in my recovery than he is.  I'm actually going to work on it with my therapist some more before trying to talk with him about it. He's just too sensitive and takes things personally.
CPTSD,fap1srr,t1_faojqm6,1576277752.0,"I think it's a process. I guess I'm just at a point where I try to express all of my love when we're having sex but ""faking"" the desire part. I don't know how say that right... My poor husband has tried everything I've asked of him so I know it's not really him and it is 100% a trust/shame issue."
CPTSD,fap1joh,t1_faovksv,1576277579.0,Yeah I totally get that. I am just not in a place yet where I can deal with the emotions my husband feels when he is feeling undervalued. I can recognize that he has some seriously deep seated issues around that and I am too busy dealing with my own stuff to open than can of worms just yet. I feel like it's kind of a no win situation right now but I don't think it always will be. Not sure if that makes sense.
CPTSD,faourlg,t1_faoo9la,1576273057.0,Ugh it's so hard! I have all of those issues so sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get through them all. I suppose it's worth it though.
schoolpsychology,faj5duv,t1_faipbne,1576124968.0,Thank you... I guess I have a lot to think about.
schoolpsychology,faigb04,t1_faf07wj,1576107137.0,Thanks! If you transition to the doctoral program does that take time off the length you're in school? I am so lost on how grad school works :/
CPTSD,f8w9auy,t1_f7aa9n7,1574885885.0,"OK so here's what you do: take a pause every time they trigger your need to hide. In that pause try and see the situation and reframe it for them. 

Example : 
Them ""oh my God what is wrong with you?""
*pause*
You ""well, I'm just trying to figure out how to sustain my mental health when people say thing like {insert their exact words here}""
Or
You""oh, I'm just avoiding you because I don't enjoy people speaking to me the way I was just spoken to""

Honestly, speaking in plain English is often a wake up call, or at least an alert that you won't allow that behavior. 

This is coming from someone who has been on both sides of the mean girl equation. Oh and her followers, find one, confide in her. It takes a ton of courage, but I swear to you if you can find a friend it will help."
CPTSD,f8m2sig,t1_f8ljgg6,1574627607.0,"Trauma is trauma. Just because severity and duration for others might be different from your experience it doesn't lesson the impact of what happened in your situation to your life. 
Please know that.  It is possible to articulate it, you can recognize the emotions and use curiosity to see what caused those feelings. Write that stuff down now. Also, if you can do this with the help of a therapist it would be better because it could be more traumatic than you think."
CPTSD,f8m1nvx,t1_f8kxe8g,1574627318.0,"You take what notes you can. If they don't serve you now they may well serve you later. If remembering triuger flashbacks, you can keep notes to minimum detail: date/who/where/type 
If that's too much limit it further but at some point it can be helpful for recovery. Know that there are people pulling for you every day."
CPTSD,f7fp3kc,t1_f7fga0a,1573684027.0,"I don't know, some people really don't have knowledge about what drives excessive apologies. It can helpful to inspect deeds for their intent and not assume everyone is working with the same base of knowledge.  Sometimes when I am feeling like ""people are trying to control me."" Which is triggering af for me, I have to take a step back and observe whether I am taking something  the wrong way. Sometimes yes, sometimes no."
