It was like nothing had ever happened.

dogs,fparvcy,t1_fp9wmkm,1588454414.0,"I worked at vet clinics for over a decade & saw way too many dogs die from heat stroke because people think they’ll tell you when they’ve had enough. It’s not true with every dog. Some will, especially as they get older & learn their limits. But it’s up to us to know canine physiology and our individual dog’s limitations as owners. They can’t cool off as efficiently as we can & Shih Tzus are a brachycephalic breed; I’d be really careful about the length of her walks. I’d try shorter walks, like 10-15 minutes, throughout the day, instead of one long walk. 

Even if she’s just poking around sniffing plants along the sidewalk, depending on the time of day & where you live an hour could be too much for a little brachycephalic-breed dog. 

I once saw a gorgeous, fit, 2 year old purebred boxer with no pre-existing health conditions die from heatstroke after jogging with his owner for 1/2 an hour on a particularly humid day in the first week of March (in Atlanta). It was awful. OP’s pup sounds like she’s doing great now, but it’s only going to get hotter, & you can’t expect your dog to tell you when they’re too hot or past their limit.

That’s like telling someone who’s been raped that it’s been hell to watch them recover-it’s understandable to feel that way, but you’re making it about you.

I’m a queer Latina, for example, and you better believe that had a huge impact on how my diagnosis has affected me and my life.

I’m here to learn from & support other autistics. If loved ones/NTs are here, I don’t mind as long as they aren’t speaking over actual autistics.

Eventually, after a year or so, he went off them, and we were all terrified he’d have another break. Fortunately he went back to normal and eventually remembered that the first break had been caused by a bad acid trip. He was very lucky, and hasn’t had any symptoms in the decade since. But we were expecting him to try & get off his meds because the dr told us that the medication either makes people feel a way they don’t like, or they feel they’re “all better” & don’t need it anymore.

My goals were to reduce my visible symptoms (which were distressing me), and that happened. Trying to check my hormone levels via lab tests in the US has been ridiculously prohibitive since 2016 due to our healthcare system. I still have $1,000+ medical debt from the last endo I went to in 2017 because my insurance didn’t cover testing she did to investigate abnormal thyroid & ACTH results (which later came back normal, thankfully). I wish I had more specific answers to provide. 

So, I would say it depends on whether your goals are strictly lab-related or there are visible hormonal signs you’re trying to address. Spironolactone can be life-changing when it comes to addressing androgenic symptoms, but Metformin helps as well."

I’ve honestly never heard of not addressing the insulin sensitivity component of PCOS, whether it has made itself apparent in labs or not. Personally, I feel safer taking a tested & standardized med than a supplement.  Obviously it’s between a dr & patient, but we’re talking about a notoriously under-treated illness here, so I think it’s a bit odd Metformin hasn’t been discussed. 

I don’t mean to imply your diet specifically is restrictive,q but I’ve noticed many people tend to post on here that if you’re diagnosed the first thing you should do is completely overhaul your diet, when that’s a pretty prohibitive step for many of us, especially in the US.

PCOS,fn9m046,t1_fn9kfxx,1586777957.0,"I never said Metformin did anything for my BP. Spironolactone effects blood pressure. Stimulant meds (the kind used to treat ADHD) increase it, so the spiro offsets that effect, and also causes beneficial hormonal side effects. 

My diagnosing endocrinologist has published books on PCOS & was a professor at a top medical school. I trust his advice to take Metformin before I’m clinically pre-diabetic. Why wait for that to happen before acting? It’s a slow process, and a well-documented risk for those of us with PCOS. The benefits (which are many) far outweigh the risks for me. The only negative side effect I experienced was diarrhea when I began taking it, which resolved with time.

Metformin has improved my PCOS symptoms caused by hyperandrogenism, improved my  cholesterol profile, and reduces my risk of cardiovascular disease. Obviously keeping me out of the pre-diabetic category as long as possible is fantastic. My dr & I see no reason for me to stop. Also, thankfully, it’s cheap & easy to find."

I’m taking these meds because my dr has advised me that restrictive diets aren’t sustainable, I have so many other things in my life to worry about as well, and I want to stave off diabetes & other long-term effects of PCOS for as long as possible. I’ve been on them for 13 years & they’ve had protective effects in terms of keeping my blood pressure low while I’m on ADHD meds & keeping me from becoming pre-diabetic.

When I had my first bad flare up this year due to seasonal allergies (pollen is awful where I am), I used it for 3 days with 8 oz sinus rinses again. It seemed to get me past the worst of it. 

I manage daily with Zyrtec, Montelukast, & Symbicort for asthma, plus ibuprofen 600-800mg once or twice a day as needed for pain during flare-ups (usually just a month during pollen season). Saline rinses with a tablespoon or two of Alkolol added are soothing as well, again usually just as needed."

aspergers,fm5bi7z,t1_fm3opfa,1585769857.0,This sounds ableist as hell. Accommodations don’t make people less resilient and our autistic peers who were diagnosed earlier arguably faced more challenges than we did (ABA??? overt discrimination???). I’m pretty sure ALL autistics are aware life is hard & unfair.
autism,flvo7qs,t1_flvl07m,1585528222.0,"I’ve consulted 2 specialists in my area and neither of them mentioned it. Did the specialist tell you what they look for to confirm diagnosis via MRI? I’m sorry if this comes off as hostile; I truly don’t mean it to. I’ve just never heard of someone recommending this & I’m curious as to whether this is a new practice. The only place I’ve heard of who always wants imaging for everything are those quacky Dr. Amen Centers, but he’s more focused on psychiatry."
autism,flvagqp,t1_flv242g,1585519736.0,"That’s so strange...my doctors have said no imaging can prove autism. It hasn’t come up once as a recommendation for diagnosis. Our brains aren’t necessarily different in ways that can be shown with imaging. Here in the US cost is the biggest obstacle to late diagnosis so I feel you, but it’s for 2 days of neuropsychological testing with a qualified specialist, which can also be really hard to find. Maybe there’s another aspect of your daughter’s diagnosis that the imaging is related to?"

TigerKing,flrmpb0,t1_flrk1el,1585423395.0,"Bi erasure is real phenomenon, though. Tons of people wouldn’t be capable of crossing that line sexually for an extended period of time for material gain or even addiction. Sorry if I don’t take the interpretation of a bunch of rednecks from OK as the definitive interpretation of someone’s sexuality. Internalized homophobia is also a thing. 

He was 19 when he met Joe, which is young. And yes young people do tend to make poor and irrational decisions, but the documentary shows they definitely don’t have a monopoly on them. Everyone over 30 knows that. But I still don’t see how whatever his mom did or didn’t do excuses Joe’s shitty behavior & the criminally unsafe gun culture at the zoo."
TigerKing,flrelf8,t1_flquvil,1585418614.0,"You make it sound like Travis being with a man is an example of how fucked up his life was, when exploring your sexuality is a pretty normal part of life for people at that age. 

He (& John!) could’ve been bi. Not sure why nobody ever considers that possibility. It’s like men have to be straight or gay, and no other options exist. 

Also, how does his mom’s behavior excuse Joe’s? Travis was an adult. His mom wasn’t responsible for all of the firearms on that property or the obvious disregard for safety shown by the people who used them."

PCOS,fkppdza,t1_fkpc6ba,1584415759.0,"I don’t know if “you’ll be fine” really applies to any group of people at a time like this, honestly. We don’t have immunity to this because it’s new (novel coronavírus). We can’t boost our immunity to it, though obviously having a compromised immune system isn’t great.

Insulin resistance as part of a PCOS diagnosis doesn’t mean you’re diabetic. Taking meds that diabetics also take doesn’t make you diabetic; spironolactone is often used for chronic heart failure. That said, PCOS can come with all kinds of fun comorbidities. So hope everyone is socially distancing & staying safe! It’s the best tool we’ve got right now to slow the spread of this thing, regardless of our individual risk factors."

stroke,fk7qqop,t3_fgq8l1,1583941821.0,"My mom had depression before her stroke but it got much worse after. We were already in family therapy at the time & therapist had referred her to psychiatrist who rx’d meds. She was reluctant to take meds prior to the stroke but her depression was so much worse after that she finally tried them within a month or so. She took forever to increase her dose to therapeutic level (like a year!), but now she says she has no idea what she was waiting for. 

She had been irritable, anxious, fatigued (beyond her new normal which is a slower pace than before). Her dr & therapist said all were very normal after stroke. She says meds & therapy help her feel like things are more manageable. It doesn’t just disappear, but it does improve a lot with help. There is also grieving that happens, similar to when people go through trauma. Hope you can find some good support. We should talk about this more."
