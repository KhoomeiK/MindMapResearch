I knew someone in Elementary School who protected me from a bully and, I left some time ago and I kept blaming myself for it because I never really did say goodbye. The only reason I've remembered this is because their name keeps being brought up in my mind throughout my life, I just cant escape it.

Anyway, just a few more ideas however I'm not sure how many will be helpful.

1. Do her friends know anything else about her? Anything and everything might be of help. Make a list of everything. Whether it's a favorite animal or something, it might relate to another ign or something that'll give us hints as to what to do next.
2. Do you know her location and her last name? If so you might be able to look it up to get more results however the most reliable information gathering technique that way would be checking local news sites or something like that.
3. Do you have any pictures of her at all? Some things like TinEye could be of help if there's anything more on the web about her. I have noticed one thing though, it doesn't search on facebook for the pictures so that's the only limit that I'm aware of.

My last course of action would be resorting to the cratecraft discord if I can figure out how to get on it, and then asking around. Otherwise there isn't much else I can do other then give you a few tips here and there."
