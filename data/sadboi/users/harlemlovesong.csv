Just keep in mind that your professor will probably not give you any extra work not available to other students and you will still probably come across as ""that person"". 

I do want to build on a point another commenter said in that you pay to access the school's resources. You sure do! But don't mistake those resources as an easy way to increase your grade."

Professors,fr2jhqi,t3_glucso,1589838381.0,"Yeah I feel you. I dropped the failure to attend policy, took late work with no penalty, extended due dates, offered about 50 more points of extra credit than I normally do and dropped some assignments.

I have had several students plagiarize and more than a few are attempting to grade appeal so I've been dealing with phone calls and emails and one request to let a student redo a paper. Like no! It doesn't matter that the student ""didn't know self plagiarism"" was cheating-we spent the first week on it, did a quiz and its in my syllabus. It doesn't matter that ""options were not fully explained""-there were announcements sent to emails, assignment instructions opened weeks in advance of the due date, lecture videos, optional class sessions, regular office hours offered!

You can't please everyone. Some people will look for any excuse to refuse responsibility for their own learning across every generation. What's that saying? ""Never let a crisis go to waste?"" Definitely applies"

Online has numerous advantages. Students don't always use them. Online is also very self-paced. Students have to be motivated, they have to read, they have to watch the lectures, they have to communicate with their professor when they encounter issues. 

And while that can be a struggle for students of any level, I find it's especially apparent in developmental students. They usually have other struggles as well-they may need accommodations (and many will refuse them), they may have gaps in their knowledge base that need to be addressed, they may be ELLs, they may have bad experiences with the subject or a myriad of other issues that interfere with learning. 

My thing is, (and I told my admin this) is that we cannot reasonable expect success if we only offer developmental online. We really should be offering a choice to take it f2f as well."
Professors,fqqkodk,t1_fqq5qh2,1589567199.0,"There should be a consequence!

But you showed leniency and, if this really was a problem only she and other students didn't have, then that implies you treated her differently from others. 

I wouldn't be surprised if she escalated but it sounds like you are expecting that"
Professors,fqqk8vh,t1_fqqfhco,1589566985.0,"I 100% agree. This student did push boundaries, and continued to do so, and I 100% believe OP conveyed expectations at every opportunity. Leniency is not an excuse to push boundaries and get away with it. 

Some students, when given an inch, will take a mile. This student took a freaking marathon and knew better. 

I think OP is right to be annoyed and go with failure of the exam. But if this student a.) got to turn other exams in late and b.) was not treated the same as everyone else, then she has a case. Yes, it was outlined in the syllabus and yes, it was clearly communicated, but if a + b then that's cause for a grade appeal."

Like I get it. This student has a history if this. You wrote the policy for the student. But you should have enforced it. I get the desire to be lenient but if you don't follow through, even the best students will circumvent expectations."
Professors,fqpveig,t1_fqpswrx,1589554680.0,"I get what you are saying but consistency is important to teaching. If you have consistently allowed a student to submit exams with proof late or through email, you have set the expectation that this is allowed. Doing an automatic fail for an exsm that is worth 25% of the over all grade, after setting this precedent of leinency, would be imo grossly unfair and the student would 100% have a case if she escalated. 

Leniency isn't all or nothing, or an invitation for students to weasel out of completing course requirements. But they need to be clear and consistent or else they invite pushback"

Definitely don't throw accusations or mention the summer thing. Express you have concerns that you feel you did not get any actual feedback and may not adequately know the course material.

Honestly, cheif, I'm going to take this with a grain of salt (nothing personal) because if you actually read the rules of this sub, you'd know questions like this aren't allowed. You also sound hyper dismissive of this professor and sound like this is a personal vendetta on your part."

You went softer than your stated policies, which is fine and understandable. It sounds like the student is not asking you to give her points she didn't earn-she is asking you to grade an exam per the policies you habe reinforced with her which are easier than the ones set out on paper.

That being said, I am usually super petty when students give me the ""I'll go to your boss!"" spiel. But, again, based on what you've written, it doesn't sound like the student is threatening you. It sounds like she is saying she will pursue the options of grade appeal available to her.

I personally would grade it like you have the other exams"
rant,fqppn6g,t3_gk70oz,1589551592.0,"Right but you have to take history and social context into account.

Sure, it isn't cool to say ""I hate the straights/whites/Christians fuck em"". Sure, it's hateful. But lets not pretend that these groups are marginalized. 

A lot of times, words are the only thing people have to use against their oppressor. I'm going to use focus predominately on sexual orientation and race since these are the two most uaed examples in thw thread.

I live in the US and I have white privilege. This doesn't mean I've never suffered. It doesn't mean I go out of my way to be an asshole to people of color. It simply means that the society is which I live favors me because of my skin color by design. I'm less likely to be killed by police. People are less likely to assume I'm up to no good if I break my routine. I'm more likely to be taken seriously. 

I'm married to a man. No one bats an eye. Before I married, I dated a girl for a few years. I got told everything from the mild (""gross"") to the extreme (threatened with corrective rape.) 

No one is going to attack me because I'm in a straight passing relationship. My job isn't going to fabricate reasons to fire me because I'm straight passing. 

Saying ""no one who would kill gays is even alive anymore its history"" is grossly inaccurate. People get gay bashed and killed often, usually as a result of gay panic. Hell, in the 80s and 90s, AIDS was considered just a disease that effected gay people and was a ""punishment for their life style."" It wasn't taken seriously or compassionately until straight people of renown fell ill with it.

Tl;dr an LBGT person saying ""fuck the straights"" is not the same as legislation that targets them or people that murder them. Social and historical context exist"
childfree,fqpnv6s,t1_fqpmzcr,1589550585.0,"100% agree. I hate the mentality that children are objects and that they are the end game, like they're some sort of achievement you are ""supposed"" to have. Children should come into this world wanted, loved and cared for. It's valid to say ""I don't make enough money/I'm dealing with mental illness/whatever other reason that could potentially cause a child harm"" and decide to not have kids. It's more fucking responsible than going ""lol oops"" or ""have yo have babies uWu"" when you can not reasonably take care of them!


Like, I personally really love children. I play Stardew Valley with my friends' kids, I tutor the eldest of them in high school English and pretend to be a dragon for the smallest ones when they want to play pretend. They call me their Aunt and I love them dearly. 

But I'm also self-aware enough to know that having children is a 24 hour job that I will absolutely fuck up.

They are both my worst performing classes and I said they would be at midterm. 

Online classes have numerous benefits-but if a student already struggles with a subject, they would probably benefit more from face to face interaction.

-some scattered make up work, mostly minor assignments and always subpar
-asked last week if they could submit three major assignments to me because they are anxious and their household has essential workers
-attached the assignments to an email anyway when I said the final due date had passed
-asked me about low grades on make up work, claiming that what they got docked points for is vague and not in the rubric (it wasn't and it is)

Grade inflation is a serious fucking problem in higher academia. My chair even told me if I wanted to ""take the easy route, he would support me.""

I'm just frustrated because we wer understaffed before the moves to admin and my colleague dying and we were told in a telephonic conference that no one would be hired for any reason due to COVID budget cuts for the 2020-2021 semester.

It just feels like a slap in the face because I and other people have expressed concerns repeatedly but i guess its cheaper to screw people out of overload than it is to pay benefits"

Uh fuck that 100%. I'm just armchair analyzing but it sounds like he constantly downplays the work and care you do in order to take care of the child you BOTH made. It sounds like he is allowed to have free time but it's ""ridiculous"" that you'd want some time to yourself. 

You were overwhelmed and upset about losing a tool you use for both work and leisure, and he responded by telling you that you need to do more to take care of the baby, even when he was right there and baby was reaching for him anyway! Please reevaluate your relationship with him and take him up on his offer of leaving if you can."

AmItheAsshole,fqede4c,t3_gi9p94,1589305708.0,"NTA 100%. He doesn't get to dictate what your comfort level is. He doesn't get to shame you for wearing clothes to bed (like most people wear pjs). It doesn't matter that it is his place- he does not get to infringe on and violate your boundaries.

I know this may seem like a small thing and I know I'm just armchair analyzing the situation but please be aware if he is willing to shame and taunt you for wearing Pjs so he can access your body unhindered, he is probably willing to violate other boundaries of yours."
Professors,fqebpcx,t1_fqe9dz4,1589304929.0,"It's limited. Regular load is 75 students and 5 courses. The overload pay caps at 175 students and 8 courses. I had 10 courses, with 12 dual credit subsections and started with 275 students total, ended with 270 students total. I didn't get paid for the extra because I maxed out the overload. It's super shitty and I've been pretty vocal about it"

Professors,fqe0447,t1_fqdzt01,1589299554.0,"It's a direct quote, unfortunately, and absolutely the reason I CCd my chair. He is very supportive. We were work friends before he became admin and he's told me multiple times he trusts me and will support my decisions. I just don't like the implication I can be bought for sexual favors.

Professors,fqdzo9y,t1_fqdz4oi,1589299342.0,"I agree. As someone who consistently goes through personal disaster on a semi-regular basis, you have to learn to adapt/ask for help. I'm not a monster. I don't ask for proof. If you are struggling, tell me and I will work with you. All I ask is you let me know before the due date if possible. That's in my syllabus.

I just think it's rich that admin expects me to be accommodating because COVID but when I had to be hospitalized for a week due to suicidal ideation and a week after that, my brother was murdered, I get told by admin ""We hired you to do a job well and you aren't doing that! The only reason you aren't fired is because everyone in the department rallied for you UwU"".

Professors,fqdk0v3,t1_fqcu7j6,1589291304.0,"You're absolutely right! I agree with you; most students are not like the ones  mentioned the OP or the comments. They have legitimate concerns and need extra help because they are facing unprecedented hardship. 

I don't think anyone here is talking about them. This sounds like venting about a very small, very loud minority. 

No one asked but here's my two cents: as someone who will freely admit I probably get too mad and talk about this loud minority way too much, they make our job harder for no reason and almost always face no consequence for it. These are the students that will be early alerted every two weeks, sent email announcement every week, who will be gently reminded there is now no late penalty and I will accept work as late as May 3, will never respond until May 9 where they send an email to the Dean claiming I didn't contact them/didn't grade/deleted all their work because I hate them. They will claim I told them not to contact them because In busy/that I don't teach/that I have hated them since day one. These are loud students that will use anything to their advantage to refuse responsibility for failing. 

I used to teach high school and one thing my mentor told me applies to most college freshman and sophomores (who typically come straight out of high school): even the best students will try to pull one over on you if you let them think they can get away with it.

It doesn't make them bad people and it isn't a moral failing. It doesn't mean I need to assume every interaction with them is them trying to bullshit me. I know they are not most of my students and I think OP does too. They're ridiculous though"

""Respect is defined as due regard for the feelings and opinions of others. In a professional setting, such as a classroom, this is defined as courteous language and behavior. Students are expected to use polite language, respect personal boundaries and to solve disputes professionally. 

Subsection: Electronic Communications
It is very easy to slip into informal language when you cannot see the other person. However, emails, phone calls and other electronic communications are expected to adhere to the guidelines above. Please include your name, class and specific items you are emailing about. Please engage in a formal tone of voice, avoiding informal references (bruh, miss, dude etc.) and keep the language courteous (avoid swear words, name calling etc.)"""

Professors,fqa0hex,t3_ghpd1g,1589210585.0,"I deal with the same issues. Here's my take on it

1. Step back when you can and remind yourself not every student has these issues.
2. Clearly outline expectations in the syllabus (it sounds like you already do this)
3. Be a hardass.( that sucks and I completely understand. My default mode is not being a hardass.) You can still have a rapport with your students while enforcing expectations. Some may resent you for holding them to a higher standard but most others will probably appreciate it. I look at it as a matter of fairness. Everyone has the same clearly defined things expected of them and if circumstances dictate that they need extra help achieving them, there is a process outlined for everyone to follow.

For the students that are rude to you about the tardy policy, don't cut them any slack. Reinforce your policy and remind them of the behavior expected of them."

She really enjoys talking about politics and keeping up with current events so that is one of our go-to topics. She brought up Plandemic and asked my opinion so I said that misinformation was dangerous and hyperpartisanism made it worse.

When we were in our early 20s, she mentioned to our mother in law that she was worried about my relationship with her now husband, who was also my best friend. At the time, I was engaged to my now husband and I have never once felt romantically inclined toward her husband. I only know about this because MIL told me about three Christmases ago.
