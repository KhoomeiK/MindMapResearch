nova,fo1lh2y,t3_g54wij,1587435893.0,Had great experiences with two bright horizons. First one was closed in 2019 due to lease issue with county and now we are at skyline. The head person at courthouse is named Megan and amazing. Very engaged and responsive. Teachers like her which is a great sign!
therapists,fdt7689,t1_fdscu1r,1578712810.0," In the VA/DOD clinical guidelines for PTSD,  EMDR is considered a top recommended option, on the same level as PE or CPT. 
I’m trained in all three and most pts prefer CPT or EMDR over PE. EMDR allows for the exposure but with one foot in the present which seems less threatening to many. It also addresses some of the distorted cognitions accompanying the memories like CPT. 
I’d highly recommend getting trained in it!"
ptsd,f84k1pc,t3_dz10ju,1574252005.0,"Experiencing an increase in symptoms after starting therapy for ptsd is very common, particularly if you start to deal with things you’ve been avoiding. So the other gets worse before it gets better’ can apply. That being said, talk to your therapist to see if this is how she/he interprets what’s happening or like other commenter said needs to switch gears or pump the breaks some."
ptsd,f7ynee8,t3_dy3w0c,1574097860.0,"Have you looked at the National Center for PTSD (www.ptsd.va.gov) website? 
It’s connected to the va but not focused just on military trauma and has a whole section on different types of trauma. 
Lots of information designed for anyone, not just veterans. 

Also check on a book called a book called trauma and recovery by Judith Herman."
toddlers,f5ji8tl,t3_do203z,1572229301.0,"It's helped my 3 y.o to have a small flashlight so she can read on her own. Or books that play music. I tell her she doesn't have to sleep but can read. Eventually she will get into her bed and fall asleep. This is after reassurances that's she's safe and we are close by. Having a monitor that I can talk through has helped as well.
We've also been using a sticker chart, so many stickers in a row for a good bedtime and she can pick a prize from a box."
ptsd,f56pzzm,t1_f56fmw5,1572026295.0,"I'd ask if you can switch to tapping (hands on shoulders or knees) or tappers (requires a device your therapist may not have) or even taking two mechanical pens and clicking with alternating hands. All of these are approved forms of bilateral stimulation to use with EMDR. 
The increased heart rate is probably related to intense emotions which isn't a bad sign. Just means you're doing the work. Good luck!

Edit: still having flashbacks isn't necessarily a sign that not working. Though talk to your therapist about what changes/progress you both see or doing see."
ptsd,f56fh3q,t3_dmy4kr,1572022562.0,"Are you doing eye movements or the alternative bilateral stimulation like tapping etc..
Sometimes dizziness can happen with the eye movements and people respond better to a different method during EMDR sessions."
ptsd,evuri10,t3_cldhhd,1564803866.0,"Prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy and EMDR are all well researched options. 
Are you seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist? Some psychiatrists just prescribe meds but some do therapy and meds. I’d be concerned if you’re seeing a therapist and they won’t discuss non-medication options. 
I’d ask their rationale? It could be that the therapist feels medication could help you improve somewhat in order to use therapy more effectively? 
Regardless it’s your choice and if you don’t want meds it’s your right to advocate for non-medication options or ask for a referral to another therapist that will provide it if your current one won’t. 
Good luck!"
