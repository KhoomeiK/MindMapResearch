I am overthinking this because one of the girls i dated broke up with me because I told her about my condition."
Anxiety,fhinpyp,t1_fhinep0,1581628312.0,I only shared it with my friend who had an anxiety attack recently. I just wanted her to know that it is normal to seek help for it. But turns out it wasn't as severe as mine. My end goal of telling her wasn't to gain sympathy but to help her out with my experience
AskReddit,fffftpt,t3_esy81b,1579883033.0,"So my tinder date invited me for a house party she was throwing. I decided to take my friend as well. Outside her place waiting for her we were smoking a joint and i told my friend that i will introduce you as carlos(because he looks spanish). As soon as we got inside her place, a dude shouted out my friend‚Äôs actual name. Turns out they were childhood friends who didn‚Äôt know they were in the same city. 

In short, my friend found his long lost friend during my random tinder date."

You pretty much summed up my thoughts.

It contains a 8 week meditation programme with different techniques. There is also an app if you dont want the book, it is for 5 USD (one time fee). The programme is designed by actual professors and is tried and tested."
