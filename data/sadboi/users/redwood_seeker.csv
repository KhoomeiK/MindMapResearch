EatingDisorders,fq0zeyw,t3_ggd2x0,1589039624.0,"I’m in nursing school and had to take a nutrition course and this past semester that was insanely triggering for me. I even had an assignment to log all of my food for a week and then plug it into MyPlate to get the calories, macros, and complete nutrition info. Yeaaaah.

Honestly, I felt triggered throughout the entire course, but what helped a little was just mentioning to the instructor what I’m going through. I did it over email. I told her the diet log project was especially triggering to me and she offered to provide me with some random made-up meal logs to use to complete the project. That helped some.

I still had to push through the course and it wasn’t easy, but if you’re comfortable sharing a tiny bit of information with the instructor, it may help."
EatingDisorders,fn9qsws,t3_fznwe7,1586782168.0,What helps me is brushing my teeth and flossing as soon as the feeling comes on and then having some tea that’s good for digestion. I can understand why brushing teeth could be triggering for some people so obviously don’t do that if it wouldn’t be good for you. But oral hygiene and a good digestive tea helps me with the urge to “reset” but in a safe way. Honestly nothing takes the feeling away completely but this helps me. Gets rid of the taste of the food and makes me feel “cleaner.”
EatingDisorders,fl8k4cp,t1_fl1dgy8,1584925537.0,I would! Hugs back!
EatingDisorders,fkz3yhu,t1_fkyngyb,1584662249.0,I’m going to be thinking of you guys tomorrow when I attempt breakfast—all of us trying together to get through this.
EatingDisorders,fky94e6,t1_fkwyl4c,1584644091.0,I like your optimism! 💜
EatingDisorders,fkwv0bt,t3_fl3we2,1584607026.0,I’m so glad I’m not alone worry about this. The only thing keeping me eating anything at all right now is the fear of tanking my immune system with malnutrition.
EatingDisorders,fjp4mp3,t1_fjnx4ib,1583541706.0,"OP here. Thanks for replying. I’ve been seeing her for almost 2.5 years, so not forever but long enough. I started seeing her when my daughter was born due to severe postpartum depression, so not for anything eating related. The depression is still hanging around although no longer postpartum related but the ED is the most pressing issue right now."
EatingDisorders,firzdgp,t3_f98j14,1582674269.0,"OP here, I don’t mind owning up. I just want to say I appreciate your comments.

I do want help. It just feels like there are no safe people I can tell who can help me...I know that’s an ED thought but that’s how it feels. Tonight my husband said he feels fat and wants to lose weight and count calories. I said sure, just please don’t try to involve me (because I know that would be triggering) and he started saying I’m “trying to create a problem where there isn’t one” and trying to impose a psychiatric illness on myself."
