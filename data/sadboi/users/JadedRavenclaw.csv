I love when I meet people who can quote the Bible bc I was one of those goody two shoes who knew every bible verse and story so I KNOW the Bible I just also know what I believe. Trust me if we go by the Bible god is way more concerned with divorce than homosexuality (if he even is at all) I know my bible and I know how boomers, homophobes, and conservatives take things out of context"
feminineboys,fr63pyj,t1_fr62b4u,1589919385.0,"I know I’m a Christian but I was raised very conservative and they have like two verses about being gay (which can be interpreted differently) but so many about divorce and that stuff but of course people don’t wanna listen times have changed. Things are different, people will respect the “times have changed” statement for everything but LGBTQIA+ people. “I can cut my hair times are different” “I don’t need to be submissive to my husband times are different” “I don’t need to wash my hands 27 times before entering the church times are different” 

But then 

A person: hey I’m LGBT, I still would like to be respected and part of religious activities 

Church: AHH GET AWAY UNCLEAN UNNATURAL we must abide by every biblical law all of a sudden! 

It pisses me off. Christians need to get a grip if they wanna preach love then don’t be bigoted pieces of shit"

AskLGBT,fr3mg04,t1_fr3lujv,1589860677.0,Thanks 💖 I try my best not to misgender but sometimes I just don’t know how someone identifies. I grew up in a very Christian house hold and I was treated as a mini missionary all my life seriously even now if I have non Christian friends my parents freak and I’m 23 and not in their house. I am very invested in the LGBTQIA community and identify as genderfluid and pan but I worry so much about being offensive I’m a naturally curious person so I just have so many questions and wonder about so many things that I didn’t have access to growing up because I was so sheltered.

Of course she became like part of the family she and your son were together for a long time. It’d be very hard to just forget all that. You caring for someone isn’t wrong. I think you should explain to your son that you love him but you don’t approve of what he did, and that it wasn’t very kind.

She didn’t just give me like three resources and bounce. She acknowledged that my issues were hurtful and hard to deal with and didn’t act like everything would get better in five seconds. Idk she just really validated me, she didn’t force me to look on the bright side. That might work for some people but for me if someone tries to force me to think of happy shit when I’m sobbing and breaking down I immediately write them off as someone who doesn’t get it.

AmItheAsshole,fq47hjr,t3_ggmc1h,1589074441.0,"NTA being LGBTQIA+ does not absolve you of all guilt and make you some blameless angel. He made the decision to marry her, he could’ve lived the bachelor lifestyle, he can’t resent her, she did not force him to have sex with her. I hope she gets checked out if he was having sex with random people. That is extremely selfish on his part. Cheating is cheating, and it shouldn’t be romanticized just because he’s gay. I realize being gay is hard and coming out is difficult but sleeping with random people behind your wife’s back, abandoning your kids, potentially giving someone a disease, and dragging a person’s name through the dirt and then calling anyone who criticizes your actions a bigot and homophobic is childish and idiotic. So what he can do no wrong now because he’s gay? That isn’t how this works, there’s a difference between appreciating people’s struggles and never holding them accountable, and there’s a different between struggling with your sexuality and being a selfish asshole. You were right, maybe if he proves himself later on you can pick up the relationship but right now he doesn’t deserve anyone’s time. I hope his poor wife has some sort of support system because it doesn’t sound like he’ll be around."

Another one that made me laugh was a guy I thought was a decent guy (friend) until he started hitting on me and I said politely he wasn’t my type. He then said I was a stuck up bitch who deserved punishment and that I was too picky that’s why I’d never find love.

You could decide to each cook for yourself or alternate cooking dinner. You probably don’t want this to become a major issue in the relationship and I think talking it through could help. Since you didn’t say idk how the chores are divvied up but make sure it’s fair for both of you. Also if you do plan to make your own dinners for yourself you should still sit down together and eat it whatever it is so it’s not like a “my way or we’re not gonna enjoy each other’s company” type thing.

Or the time I fell down the stairs (at church) and broke my leg and after holding it in super long I began sobbing because I was young and the pain was awful. And he carried me out while whispering in my ear “stop crying it’s embarrassing” tried to force me to walk on said broken leg and three days later when we finally went to the ER we found out it was broken in two places and if I’d tried to walk on it, it would’ve been much worse.

By your/Onisions own words you had a messed up childhood according to you, your father was a pedo and choked you and was sent to jail how can you tell that story, talk about your depression, and difficult times then say all your victims are lying because they had the same shit going on (btw I tend to believe Grogs made up these stories about his father, but that isn’t the point, he wants to have shit both ways when he can’t) a very simple search will show the multiple times you’ve gone on and on about your horrible dad, so I say for the thousandth time with you, which is it? 

5. HOLY SHIT ONLY YOU COULD CONTRADICT SO MUCH YOURSELF IN ONE POST LIKE THIS! You accuse the victims of having mental disorders and then defend Onision/yourself for possibly having narcissistic personality disorder. Which is it? Are mentally ill people dangerous liars? Or should we not be so quick to judge. 

6. Ohhhh so now they were actors huh? Which is it Groggins? While making the videos you made a joke about the girls you rated being underage because you said it wasn’t illegal to have an opinion, then when people pushed it you claimed that you’d had (18+) put on there and can’t be responsible for liars, then when that was debunked about ten trillion times you decide they were actors now. I don’t wanna give you tips because you’re a fucking piece of garbage but shutting up and keeping your story straight would probably help your case, I mean not anymore because you’ve contradicted yourself about a billion times now. 

Everything is always different when it comes to you, you just dig yourself into a deeper and deeper hole and it’s like you can’t help yourself. You actually think people buy this shit. You contradict yourself constantly. Also, STOP CALLING YOURSELF JAMES! ITS A DEAD GIVE AWAY! NO ONE CALLS YOU THAT BUT YOU!!"

Advice,foq417m,t1_fopsey4,1587982209.0,I’m looking into their other stuff and it’s very close to other images I can find online. I kinda tried to confront them and they listed the slight differences but it definitely looks almost identical.
Advice,foply75,t1_fopl3ex,1587965069.0,"I asked and they said that they have different execution but the same idea. Now that I’m looking closer the shading is ever so slightly different but not different enough I feel like to claim you were just inspired. It’s practically the same image almost exactly with slightly different shading and one less tree. I don’t know laws or rules about transformative art or how much an image needs to be changed to be considered your own piece, but the promise of the fivver user was an, exclusive custom, hand drawn tattoo."

depression,fom8sb8,t1_foj9i64,1587881710.0,When I finally got some good luck I started realizing just how much jealousy was taking over my life and made active choices to stop then that luck was snatched away and I’m back at square one and I care even less because I’m bitter over that thing being taken away.
depression,fom8o6s,t1_fojdmpc,1587881610.0,It does :/ sorry you’re going through that
depression,fom8mxq,t1_fojd76v,1587881578.0,I know I am looking for it but unfortunately the things I want changed aren’t things I can go about changing myself I just feel like some people have way more luck than others
