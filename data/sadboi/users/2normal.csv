GlobalTalk,fr6oqu9,t1_fqzob08,1589930234.0,"The thing I’ve noticed from traveling across the country is how different each region is. I’m from the north east and when I went to stay with family in the south I felt so out of place. Where I’m from I would say that some of the stereotypes apply, but there are other aspects that make us distinct. 


I don’t get offended by the stereotypes either. I’ve traveled abroad as well and the cultural difference can be a bit intimidating. I can see how some Americans can appear. That’s why I try to approach things with an open mind and recognize the mistakes I may make due to my upbringing. For example, my friends and I were at a bar in Canada. 


I noticed other people staring at us. I didn’t even realize we were being loud. It was embarrassing but taught me one of the biggest differences. At least we tend to top well due to our culture so that’s a plus for putting up with us."

You made it clear that you had no interest in interacting with your ex-wife. She should have respected that. 


I feel that your sister may have heard another story from Emily or maybe you sounded too harsh from her perspective. She probably harbors a lot of guilt and wants to feel “forgiven” as a new mom. This is not your responsibility. She needs to find peace on her own. 


Your sister probably mentioned that she was an aunt and she latched onto this similarity to try and make amends. This in and of itself isn’t wrong but she should have respected your boundaries. I would communicate this to your sister that you felt your boundaries were crossed. Saying you don’t care (which is valid) may have left the impression that you were cold or malicious. Unfortunately the language we use can be interpreted in ways we don’t intend. This doesn’t make you an asshole. It just leads to miscommunication"

It’s funny because on the opposite end of the spectrum, otomes rarely have 18+ scenes. I play VNs regardless of h-scenes. 

I think it’s such a huge selling point in Japan that many developers don’t forgo it. I think that’s why they’ve become expected especially in traditional “dating sim” style games. It’s a shame because I often feel that story can suffer because of it. Games by key such as Little busters and air don’t even include them anymore in updated versions because of how bad they are.

Sometimes people return animals for the wrong reasons as well which is another red flag. 

Obviously posting anything animal abuse related was a no go as well. If they were a backyard breeder or were looking into breeding that was also a red flag (especially with purebreds).

TheArcana,fowd4p6,t1_fowbcb5,1588117471.0,"I don’t use twitter or tumblr regularly so I do have limited exposure. I remember Nadia performing worse than Asra and Julian before the route expansion. 
Asra being non-binary is something I wasn’t aware of. It wasn’t included in the game so I wasn’t sure what he identified as. 
I should have worded it differently in that regard. I just noticed in similar games I’ve played that female characters tend to preform worse. 
I’m glad to see the trend changing! I suppose it isn’t a mainstream otome. I tend to count it since there a lot of similarities. Regardless I’m glad to be proven wrong since that means the genre is changing for the better"
TheArcana,fowbtog,t1_fowawpk,1588116760.0,"Great point
I noticed her ranking lower than Julian and Asra in the beginning but I just double checked. She’s higher than lucio for sure! 

It was just a theory I had since I’ve noticed in other games in a similar genre tend to have female routes underperforming. I’m glad The Arcana is helping to break the mold"

I just know from my life and relationships that my experience very plain looks have lead to me being viewed more negatively or having to put in more work to get that initial interest"
TheArcana,fow6we4,t1_fovnuu6,1588114126.0,"Yeah I was surprised they used her to do a fake out.... 

I’m thinking even if her numbers are lower it could be due to the demographic. 

As a queer woman into otome games, I notice that the majority of people who play them tend to be heterosexual women. Not to say that they aren’t open to playing a female route or that there aren’t other queer people playing these games either. I think that is another factor as to why Portia’s route is not be as “popular” or doesn’t make as much money. 

Her route also starts fairly slow in my opinion which could cause people to save their keys or coins for other routes."
