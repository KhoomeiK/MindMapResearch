I was manic for weeks before people noticed, not sleeping for days at a time. I knew something was wrong with me but I felt like I didn’t have the time to deal with it. Other things seemed more important and I felt like I had it all in control. When I started seeing and hearing things I knew something was seriously wrong and I was in danger. It was terrifying. I have since graduated and have gotten my illness under control but I still look back on those weeks of untreated mania and think about how dangerous it was that I attempted to live my life go to class, work full time, attend orchestra rehearsal, give tours as a school ambassador all the while seeing and hearing things and not sleeping or eating.
