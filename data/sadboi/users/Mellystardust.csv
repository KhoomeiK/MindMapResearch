But don't discount the welfare checks. They do know the police won't be able to do this every day or as often as they'll want to track you down, so they will employ the above. They will have their subordinates stalk you (my nmom consistently sent my aunt to my last job until I was forced to quit). They will send you countless letters, gifts, cards, money and more (just yesterday, my son and I were sent a care package that was addressed to my partner, and forged in my dads handwriting because for some reason my mom thinks she can slip in whatever she wants if she disguises herself). She has sent my son everything from a chromebook (which was thoroughly scrubbed to ensure no spyware, keystroke loggers or the like existed by a pro before allowing use), to 50 dollar bills to family photos and even this weird GPS tracking butterfly coin thing (that I threw away..must have been a fun trip through the transfer station lmao). I've gotten more gifts, and of higher value than I ever got when I actually talked to my parents. If you have pets or kids or a partner, they may get showered in guilt trip packages, too, as mine do. Expect them to forge the writing of individuals they think you may talk to, so you're tricked into opening their mail. They may also do that via phone or internet, using other people's phones and accounts to get to you. You may have to prepare to go nc on some subordinates in addition to your nparent, at least temporarily. If you or your prospective roommate have a child in the home, expect a wild accusation to be called into child protective services.

Be prepared for the 'wellness check', especially if you end up going lc or nc on them when you move.

I strongly recommend not letting your nparents hold your apartment key for *any* length of time, not even to feed your pet when you're away, or to put your mail in the house, or just for a trusted person to hold a spare. They *will* make a copy of your key, for when they feel they need to use it. My mother did this behind my back, and started welcoming herself into my apartment. At the time, we were in contact. I confronted her and she told me she didn't have a key but I kept leaving my doors unlocked. I knew I wasn't but she gaslit me so hard. She eventually admitted it, and that she comes in at will, whenever she wants, to have a convenient bathroom to use when she's in town. The difference is she wasn't given permission to do this. She violated my trust and privacy.

Depending on how abusive this relationship is and the level of privacy you're seeking, you may want to not disclose your address to them. But, you'll also need to be careful who you do disclose it to, because word travels fast. Also, if you register to vote at the new address and don't want your address out there, you need to go find your voting record online and request it removed. It is too easy to find one's address through publicly available voter files. It actually happened to me and almost compromised my safehouse location."

Will you make mistakes? Definitely

The nparents in our lives have selfish reasons for putting a chokehold on us and our goals, and sometimes we're met with feigned concern we'll fail *or* we'll be met with insults and be told directly we'll fail. At no point does it seem like the npeople of our lives will take us and our plans seriously and discuss things on an equal level, as adults. The nparent will always see themselves as a more supreme adult than their children. They will always see their adult children as *children*- except they expect you to pay everything your own way, work, and maintain your adult existence on your own *YET* listen and follow their every command. 

Whether it is they can't stand to see you fail, or they refuse to let go of you- both reactions are going to end up terribly. You're eventually going to move out, even if they won this particular battle. They're eventually going to have to accept that making mistakes is an essential part of becoming an adult."

When my son was around that age, maybe more like fresh 7 rather than almost 8, he would sometimes ask for assistance with hygiene tasks.

I was afraid that I would be helping him too old, but even more afraid if I neglected his request for help that he would feel neglected and ignored. And hygiene *is* important. So I obliged. 

In your brother's situation, though, things seem different. It seems your mom lacks trust in your brother to care for his hygiene. With that lack of trust, it seems she has decided he now has no body boundaries or privacy. 

Unless he specifically asked for help, it's not really known how he feels about this *help*. She might think it's okay to bathe him if he doesn't say no outright, and he may choke the uncomfortable feeling down, as she subverted his voice. I wonder how he feels about it.

Guided by one to three therapists, a *good* group will make sure everyone who needs to be heard that session gets to be heard. Depending on the size of the group, you may not get time to talk in depth every group. In good groups, even these days feel valuable. These days, your therapy and advice will be through the stories of others. Also, if there's a need to delve into a private topic or one that would take up too much time, the group therapists usually set up occasional individual appointments to supplement the group work. 

Not all groups work well, though. A good therapy place with group therapy will have a multitude of groups and be willing and encouraging of you trying new ones until you find a good fit. One time, a new therapist joined my group. That new therapist was an old acquaintance of mine from high school. That was a no-no for me. I told my primary therapist, who respected me so much she even offered to resume the group without her in it. I ended up switching groups anyways. But being validated and given power of choice felt really good. 

Right now, I am in individual therapy- due to both that group situation I mentioned earlier and my work schedule at the time. I typically do 30 minutes once a week or every other week. It's just the right amount of time for me, now I'm established with my therapist. She knows my history, current happenings, and the dynamics of the relationships I hold from the group we were part of together. Because of this, I don't have to spend time explaining backstories.

I've been in therapy since 2011- 4 years before I went NC on my nmom and family. Having therapy before, during, and after our falling out was super helpful. It helped me through that really shxtty time."

I've had 3 unsuccessful stints at college, yet am only a semester from graduating (probably more now, as credits expire over time). Being off and on my own young has been an immeasurable challenge. I'm still struggling and my son is 12 and I'm about to be 30 in a week."
raisedbynarcissists,fr0wuaq,t3_gm16sc,1589808581.0,"You don't have to act today, please remember that.
Also remember, your therapist is working with your best interests at heart. If you sincerely think this is not the case, I could not more strongly encourage you to ask to see a different therapist in the practice or go elsewhere. Your therapist should *always* have your best interests in mind. 

I can see her worry, as it is intensely harder to maintain good grades and attendance in college when you're out on your own and expected to cover all your expenses. That kind of hardship will make it much more difficult to obtain your degree. Your therapist has likely taken into account your safety when making this recommendation. Were your safety in imminent danger, I'm going to guess she would help create a plan to leave. 

This doesn't mean your parents aren't narcissists. This doesn't mean that your relationship is healthy and you're unjustified in your feelings. It just means that the risks and potential consequences of moving out with a boyfriend you've dated for less than a month to complete your studies seem greater than holding out to complete your degree, so you'll be able to earn more money and have an easier transition to independent living. 

Also, this is their advice for *now*. It doesn't mean the situation can't change. There may be a time where leaving is the better option. If you don't think you can trust that either you or your therapist can appropriately recognize that time, I would definitely consider getting either a different or an additional therapist."

raisedbynarcissists,fr0to75,t3_gm0o27,1589806467.0,"It's a tough situation, without a doubt. The fact that you've

A) realized that *you* are experiencing this issue and own your part of it

B) have been able to assess why your difficulty exists

is significant progress that should be recognized.

The short answer is, with any new habit we want to start, we have to keep doing it, even if it is uncomfortable at first.


The long answer: Think about wanting to start drinking 8 glasses of water a day. If all you've ever drank was juice, transitioning to water may feel awkward and forced. But you like the benefits of water and want those benefits, so you set some reminders, buy a big bottle, and keep chugging along (literally and figuratively (ba dum tss)).

If I were in your situation, I'd try to actively make saying 'I love you' a new habit. I would try writing it at first, over and over. Maybe I'd even make a homemade card for my child with those words, like a first step. (In my personal life, I made a habit to write a colorful, encouraging message to my son every day on a small marker board on the fridge. He's about to be in 7th grade, but still looks at and appreciates the message. Sometimes I think he checks it, in anticipation I left a new one.)

Then, I would start trying to say it out loud. Maybe to myself at first in the car, I would start saying ""I love you"" 
If that is too hard maybe I'd start with 'I love your smile' 'I love your excitement when you play the flute', 'I love how you care about your brother so much'... anything to just get the main word in- ""love"". I would then try to go to ""I love YOU"" maybe say it in a mirror for a while- a few days, months, however long you gotta do it to make it not choke out so hard.

Then I would practice the things I did alone with my child(ren). I would even go as far to set a phone reminder so I am reminded to say ""I love you"" today. 

It will be awkward, undoubtedly. If it's something you want to do, I believe you can!"

raisedbynarcissists,fqzt3kb,t1_fqz1g6b,1589774727.0,"Wow TYSM for sharing this link. It really rings true for me, especially because my nmom actively discusses her estrangement with strangers and always role reverses and plays the victim. Everything I did was cruel and for 'no reason'. All of her actions were out of ""sincere worry"". If she was ""sincerely worried"", she would have taken the judgment of the professional help she sought the first time. There was a different sincere worry. There was a sincere worry she could no longer have the chokehold she did over my life, that she could no longer regularly barge in my house with the key she made behind my back.

For all the letters she has written me over the last 5 years, none of them have an apology. She's incapable of apologizing. They're all ""I did what I did because I love you"". (What she did was call DCF (dept of children and families) on me twice, alleging I sold my hot water heater for drugs, injected my son with drugs, and wh×red my child out to my partner's father for money. After that case was dismissed, she was convinced I got away with ""fooling"" authorities, and reopened the case, claiming I wasn't sober. I was, but was burdened with proving myself with weekly urine tests and going to therapies for 17 hours a week for almost a year. After I was definitely found to be cleared again, my nmom opened up a case against me in probate court to rescind my custody. Fortunately DCF helped provide me with lawyers and testimonials from their staff, and helped me win my case. After losing the case, she tried on two separate occasions in the next 6 months to kidnap my son- once by waiting in the am by his bus stop but I was there. It wasn't until after he got on the bus, that I spotted her. Then I demanded she left. The second time, she tried to grab him and bring him home with her (10 states away is ""home""), but he ran from her. The one time I was a minute late to go outside to watch my son walk to the door, the one time, the one time I had to pee, she tried her second kidnapping attempt. She then continues to flood me with contact, which now is just a bunch of letters written to me. I don't have the spoons to open the letters anymore, but I'm still regularly tortured by her. What she *won't* say is that she pulled all this sh×t because I wouldn't dump my boyfriend and move in with her to Florida. I already tried her duplex in Florida idea. They gave me half a duplex when I got married, sent me pix of my new empty house, only to arrive and have my dad living there with no real intention to leave. I lasted 3 weeks in one bedroom with my husband at the time, 4 year old son, and cat who wasn't allowed to leave the room (that's really hard to do if you've ever tried). I wasn't willing to upend my life to live with them again and my mom wasn't having it. She was upset she couldn't raise my son like she took over my brother's two children. She was upset she couldn't control my therapy/treatment and that I didn't want Christian based therapy in Florida. She was even more upset I went NC on her. The NC is what spouted the repeated DCF calls, wellness checks, court case and kidnapping attempts."

Because she used her attention and love as an object to hang over my head that she could take away at will, she thinks I must be doing that too. She doesn't think that her actions, compiled over time, in conjunction with the big event that caused the nc, were abusive or harmful. She once wrote to me and told me she thinks she may be a narcissist, but the sentiment was preceded and followed by negating statements that essentially blamed me for being narcissistic.
