Keep sharing, us that didnt have the pleasure of meeting her in this life NEED to know how wonderful she was. The whole"" im so sorry for your lost"" is pointless.   My baby daughter died less then a month ago and when people say im in their thoughts and prays i want to slap them silly. Death and grief and loss of true love can only be understand by us that have walked through this living Hell. Im slowly counting; time and tears. Both seem endless without the one we loved."
