I also think my dog had COVID and one of my docs agrees. My dog started coughing and sneezing about a month ago. Just a little each day, but he was also lethargic and didn‚Äôt want to interact. I couldn‚Äôt take him to the vet bc they were closed (and I don‚Äôt have the money) so I don‚Äôt know.

When I‚Äôm by myself I still talk out loud. I figure people assume I‚Äôm wearing a Lear buds and am on my phone. We can hide behind technology :)"
mentalhealth,fiz9mlg,t3_fakd9u,1582857406.0,"It could be any number of things, but it‚Äôs not weird. I feel like that when I‚Äôm dissociating or in a serious depression. That‚Äôs why I have an emotional support dog. When I can‚Äôt feel where I am I can feel him and get grounded. There are times that I‚Äôm so deep in the numbness that even he can‚Äôt bring me back. Don‚Äôt feel weird or bad about what you‚Äôre going through. Get professional help and find safe places to be when you‚Äôre feeling that way. (If you can.) All the best!"
domesticviolence,fiz9a3w,t3_fae3j5,1582857175.0,"You‚Äôre a great friend! Start by telling her that she can‚Äôt save him. If he is suicidal and harming then you can call the paramedics to go help him. Or have the police do a welfare check. This depends on where you live though. But, really she simply can‚Äôt save him."
politics,fiz9066,t3_fahkti,1582856991.0,Every company needs to amend their sick day policies today! And companies that offer unlimited paid sick days need to encourage people to stay home if they get sick. Not ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù but sat home and actually get some rest.
domesticviolence,fiz8fto,t3_fajm2w,1582856614.0,"I‚Äôm sorry all of this is happening. My partner (who I just broke up with, but we still live together because we own) yells and spits at me and calls me awful names. It‚Äôs a terrible place to be. I‚Äôve been with my partner for far too long and he hasn‚Äôt changed. He says he‚Äôs so much better, and in some ways sure, but the basics, the yelling and name calling is exactly the same. 

For your physical safety and mental health and for your son please find a women‚Äôs shelter. They can give you a safe place to stay and help you get a diploma to move up to a better paying job. I don‚Äôt know where you live but there are a lot of organizations that can help you. 

Stay safe!"
DID,fivaxqv,t3_f9tgmm,1582757104.0,"Interesting question. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve experienced that, but have picked out pieces from other people to make me whole. An accent a mannerism‚Äîit happens without me even realizing it."
CPTSD,fitp34m,t3_f9lfrv,1582726110.0,"Yes, it sounds foreign. I even get tongue tied when I have to say it. Recently, for a few weeks I constantly heard a voice whisper my childhood nickname. Then I broke up with my partner and the voice started whispering my adult name. It was a taunt and sucks."
adultsurvivors,fitovhr,t3_f9san5,1582725963.0,Yes! It‚Äôs so common (I think) among sexual abuse survivors. I want to/do dress in a way that I believe will make people look at me but I don‚Äôt want someone to say anything about it to me. And I hate that sexualizing myself is the place I find the greatest satisfaction. It‚Äôs fucked personal relationships.
DID,fitoj3l,t3_f9o0zj,1582725722.0,"It‚Äôs so hard to find someone. I was in the mental healthcare system (US) for over 20 years before I was properly diagnosed. My suggestion is to look for a trauma therapist. They should know how to work with DID patients or are more likely to know some who can help. 

In the US try NAMI first. It is National with local chapters. I hope you find someone!"
bipolar2,fito3hj,t3_f9qrxc,1582725417.0,"Very well put. As an artist I always romanticized it. So many artists seemed to have the same symptoms. I know better now. Can‚Äôt hold down job anymore. I fantasize about going on a long walk with my dog along the river, cleaning my room or exercising. So far I can‚Äôt get myself to do any of it."
DID,fhpfts6,t1_fhoy9zp,1581788617.0,"Super good response! I just broke up with my partner for that exact reason. And I stayed in it way too long, but of course I hoped he‚Äôd change."
DID,fhfepoh,t3_f2vwuv,1581541894.0,"I lost my last job because of exactly this. I should say upfront that I‚Äôm really sorry and don‚Äôt have a solution. 

I created a presentation that I thought was amazing. I can remember to total high I had when I finished it. I thought this would win my boss over (new boss). I was so proud of it. When she finally reviewed it she trashed it. When I was it as me I could see it was trash. A younger part wrote it. 

I couldn‚Äôt do anything. Whatever I said would mean I can‚Äôt do the job, justification for firing. 

I would think as a student you will have support. Do you have a doctor that can write up something for the school that would give you permission to retake as needed? 

I hope it works out!"
DID,fhfdviv,t1_fhes140,1581541417.0,When I start to think about it i am so overwhelmed that I immediately have stop.
domesticviolence,fhfd4vc,t3_f2vl4u,1581540995.0,I‚Äôm really sorry this is happening. Do you have a doctor that can label him an emotional support dog? It could help with this situation.
bipolar2,fhf0nl5,t1_fhezazt,1581533776.0,"That was my SO‚Äôs response. He actually wore that like a badge of honor and lorded it over me. He said so many times that he was right for 20 years like it absolved him of all his bad behaviors. Again, thank you for sharing."
