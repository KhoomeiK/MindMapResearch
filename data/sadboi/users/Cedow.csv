ukpolitics,fqq8c0j,t1_fqq7lc5,1589561124.0,"> Honestly, do you even stop to consider what's coming out of your mouth?

This is not an accurate description of anything. It's just you being a little weasel and trying to feel superior to other people. 

Unfortunately, it turns out I'm the real idiot here as I made the unenviable mistake of getting into an argument with a moron on the internet."

ukpolitics,fqq5f7j,t1_fqq4we5,1589559703.0,"> So why did you criticise me for pointing out the problem without having a solution? Doesn't make sense.

Where did I criticise you? I simply said that, unless you know of a better metric, BMI is the best metric we have. I think you're getting way too defensive. Do you have some kind of persecution complex? 

> https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215

This actually doesn't answer the question as it refers to health of the individual. I was asking about using it as a metric for measuring the population."
ukpolitics,fqq3wqz,t1_fqq2ykj,1589558966.0,"Yes, of course you could point out a problem even if you can't fix it. That's so obvious that I didn't even deem it worth responding to.

1) the innacuracy of BMI is actually a big issue

However, it is fairly decent at estimating levels of obesity for the average person. Unless you have a better metric to go by then it's doing a great job of what it was designed to do."
OurPresident,fqd9pmv,t1_fqb1he1,1589284240.0,"I don't know why you're being downvoted so hard. Letting Trump win another term to try and force some kind of change in the dems is not the correct play here. Whatever you think of Biden and his policies, they are not nearly as bad as another term of Trump would be.

Biden already won the popular vote in the primaries. He's not going to shift his policies dramatically because doing so would probably mean alienating the portion of the voting base that already voted for him. If your disagreement is with him on a personal level, he's certainly not going to drop out because, again, he already proved he has the popular vote.

Whatever hand you try to force them to play, progressives are still in the minority right now. Real change is going to come much slower than you all would like - you need to sway the minds of a huge swathe of people who have grown up being taught very different values. Generational - not instantaneous - change is what you should be aiming for, and that isn't achieved by alienating yourselves from the rest of the party and not voting. If dems lose this time around, it's you guys who will be blamed. How can the democratic party trust progressive voters who won't vote for them?"
