depression,f9e7y2r,t1_f9e4x59,1575240628.0,"To make a plan for you two to keep. Like “every tuesday we will go for a coffee” or some thing like that. It has to be regular so that you can allway look forward to that day/time. This might help you. 

In other comments you’re saying that she seems like she wants to keep he alonetime and with a plan like this she would have it. It also seems that she sugests to breake up if you’re not happy that’s why I think it will be better to “sell” this idea as “some random thing you found somewhere and want to try out” rather than “something that will fix you relationship”. That’s because it shouldn’t introduce thoughts about break up but rather about self improvement. 

This ofcourse is a little hack that will help you be together even if she doesn’t want to. It isn’t the best permanent solution but it is a big step in the right direction."
depression,f9e4m20,t1_f9e2i9x,1575239688.0,"Hm, make a schedual. It’s a prooven way of crating time from nothing. If you both stick to it, it might work. But from what I’ve read in other comments make it look like “Yo I’ve found this cool thing that successfull people do...” not like “Our relationship is trash so we shoul fix it bcs noone wants to die alone.”

I hope you get the point and that it wasn’t a bit too harsh. You’re still a child ... I’m still a child too. Do what you have to do to have fun. Don’t drown in your sadness like me. It’s pretty shit."
depression,f9dxhv0,t3_e4lilh,1575237685.0,"I had a girlfriend for a year and a half. The begining was great because she was as twisted as me but after about a year things started to go down the hill. We eventualy broke up and I don’t realy regret it. She now has a boyfriend who is a fking normie and works in a bank and can’t even make changes in his own personality but as long as she’s happy I don’t care. On the other hand there is me, I haven’t had any meaningfull relationships since and while it’s true that I do feel pretty lonely from time to time I’m still alive and that’s what counts.

I’m a 17 year old super weird guy that somehow got a chance to participate in some Microsoft student thing. I live an unhappy life in an unhappy family with little to no friends, sometimes someone says that I’m the smartest person they’ve ever met and that they want to be like me but I tell them that it’s because smart peoples’ only goal is to live an unhappy life and that I am a terrible person and noone who’s ever gotten to know me liked me. 

My advice is to do things when you are able to do them, not when you’re comfortable doing them. If you think you might just barely be able to break up with the girl (and that there is a reason to do so), do it.! If you wan’t to break up, It’s too late and you’ve just wasted some of your time. 

Btw if you do break up be sure to recover from it befor you dive into sth else. Otherwise you might just find youself stuck in another disfunctional relationship.

Well, that’s what I‘ve had to say. But remember, that you’re in control of your life. Don’t let other people hold you back. 

♥️ Just a little heart to keep you motivated. GL"

Usualy those are just schoolmates, sometimes teachers. I think people are cuter when they are suffering because than they open up and talk to you with respect and with a hope they can be loved. It feels so good seeing their young soul in front of you crying, realizing, standing up and suddenly walking away feeling happy. They never thank you, they never ask about you.
