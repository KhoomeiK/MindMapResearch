TwoXChromosomes,f0fhjt2,t3_d4l4ol,1568583467.0,"I can't speak for all states but I work for CPS and adoptive services in Florida and I also work closely with a pregnancy care center which is an unpaid job. In my experience for working there for the past thirty years, we have only had a total of five women who came in with a child that was not through consensual sex. For all of them, we helped them carry their pregnancies to term and helped get them food and shelter. Many of them had come from horrendous abusive relationships and human trafficking situations. We also helped two of them go back to school once they carried the child to term and one is currently attending the Morsani School of Medicine at USF. The pregnancy care center helped cover all costs of therapy, medical appointments, police investigations, lawyer fees, helped one of them get a house out of the state to get away from her abuser even though we had solid evidence he had abused and raped her, and one of the children's DNA even helped put a pimp behind bars who had been selling underaged and unwilling  women for prostitution as well as young boys in the Orlando area. All of the children were found adoptive homes with the consent of the mothers and many of them choose to have a closed relationship meaning they would not know where the child would be put and the child would not know who they were. The adoption process is long on my end but is not for the mother as she only has to sign a few sheets and give birth to the child. Pregnancy is a lot harder than most people realize. A majority of women who get abortions are not victims of rape as this goes to women who are young like college-aged and practiced unprotected sex or women who are impoverished and practiced unsafe sex and do not have the means to have a child however but it is important that they are included in the conversation. Also, many of the women who do practice unsafe sex do so because of lack of understanding and education on STDs, STIs, pregnancy and protective contraceptives and birth control. I actually used to lead a free class in the pregnancy care center that taught about consent and birth control and contraceptives to girls and women in high school and college although I had to give it up because I wanted to spend more time with my family. It takes a total of thirty minutes in the state of Florida to find a match for an unborn child who needs to be adoptive and this almost unanimously the case across the United States and Canada as babies are the most demanded age for adoption as they are less likely to be suffering from a mental illness due to trauma and are a clean slate for the parents. It is like having a child without childbirth. This is disheartening as a majority of the children who enter the foster care system are above the age of nine years old. I am a mother of five and a single mother at that. All five of my children were adopted because we could not find them a home for years and years and years. All are victims of sexual assault and rape and two of my daughters and one of my sons were sex trafficked across the state and  three suffer from RAD a disorder that makes it hard for children to attach to a caregiver because of severe trauma and mistrust in the past. I am a victim of rape myself as I was taken advantage of by my swimming coach. I was abused by my mother emotionally and physically although never sexual and my father left when I was seven not that he was there for me much anyways before then. So I understand what it is like to feel powerless in the hands of someone who is supposed to care for you. I did not speak out about the many rapes until I was 22 and many people still did not believe me because I waited so long which i dumb because rape is one of the worst things that can happen to you and most exposed crime anyone can ever commit against you and it is embarrassing and extremely difficult to talk about especially when your rapist is someone as high up as a swimming coach and is held in high respect by your community. I have also been through an abortion myself and it is my deepest regret. I work with women like this because I want no one to suffer the psychological consequences of abortion like I did and if they are I want no one to walk through it alone. I am not completely against abortion because my eldest daughter had an abortion at the age of 12. She was raped by her previous foster parent (although this monster who dared to put his hands on my future child does not deserve to be called a parent or a man) and I was her foster mom when we found out and I put two and two together. Her body was malnourished because of years of abuse and she would not have been able to handle the pregnancy or the birth. We had the abortion done at a hospital. I know this comment will probably be deleted and bashied the heck out of it but here are my two cents."

That is literally the stupidest idea I have ever heard. 

So you want to screw around for a class you or your financial aid is paying for. 

If financial aid is paying for you and you fail keep in mind I worked my ass off to get the bright futures scholarship. I worked hard every single day of my high school career. Always got A's and a few B's in my freaking math classes and like one or two C's. I graduated with more than 50+ high school credits because of dual enrollment and AP and extra classes. I attended Pasco Eschool, My high school, and the duele enrollment college full time. I went to HS in day DE at night. This was with AP classes as well. I also was in a bunch of clubs which I participated in regularly. I made states for most of my competitive clubs and was in three different bands. I also was in volunteer clubs and honors clubs not just to be in them and get a cord but actually participated. I was at every fundraiser, every meeting and every event I could go to and if I couldn't it wasn't because I wanted to sleep in or watch Youtube or whatever. It was because of conflicting clubs, taking the freaking SAT/ACT again, or conflicting events from band usually. I was in so many yearbook photos every year my band classes would play spot the r/EsmeFrost in the pictures. I took the ACT four times the SAT four times and couldn't get a high enough score to get it. I went to tutoring I paid for myself and was in AP Calc and AP Stat so well above the level. I worked many jobs as a babysitter which is literal crap because people treat you like an expendable dog and pay you peanuts to watch and entertain kids and clean house top to bottom. Yeah, I didn't sleep most nights. Yeah, I worked hard. Still, am. I didn't get a single scholarship and I applied for 135. FAFSA didn't give me anything but loans. I still am applying for scholarships. Thank goodness my grandparents left us accounts for college because they knew our parents won't be able to afford it or else I literally would not be here. Now I tell you this not so I can be all I deserve it wah wah wah because I didn't get the score I don't deserve the scholarship. But I have seen way too many kids just screw around with a partial or full bright futures. Getting real damn sick of it. 

Regardless of what scholarship it is if I can do all that as a HS student you can get your ass to class and not screw around and be lazy."
