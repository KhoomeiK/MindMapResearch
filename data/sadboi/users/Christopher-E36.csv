I am not experienced in real estate at all, but I find it a little short sited to discourage a young person to not get into a field because of very general stereotypes. I’m curious"
selfhelp,fqsvns3,t3_gkp871,1589620515.0,"My dms are open as well and I have a similar story to yours. My best advice and you may here this a lot on your journey is to forgive yourself. Love and understand yourself, but don’t force it because from what it seems like is that you can’t lie to yourself which can be a good thing. I don’t think you are a horrible person, you may not have met your own standards but you can work everyday to try and reach them, that is why waking up healthy and capable is so awesome because you are given another chance to do your best."
schizoaffective,fqsujr8,t1_fqqxxqs,1589619347.0,"Wow exactly this, I’m glad you and I have a similar mindset. May I ask how long you have been diagnosed and whether or not you are medicated? I have been off of risperdal for over three months now and I am so grateful to be where I am at mentally."
FinancialPlanning,fqnb202,t3_gjpq8p,1589491709.0,How does an IRA yield 4%? Are we assuming our investments are getting that 4% or does having money with a broker in an IRA yield 4% without investing?
schizoaffective,fqna2g1,t1_fqlmoxi,1589491227.0,Wow this is truly an amazing comment. I have never heard that about my diagnosis really and it makes me feel uncomfortable that I do experience these extremes in my head and my emotions so often
schizoaffective,fp0qk8a,t3_gak984,1588214735.0,I’m sorry it caught you by surprise again. For me when I slip back into psychosis I feel immensely betrayed and saddened that I was that naive in the first place. But don’t let that negative energy bring you down too bad. Keep doing well for yourself and others :)

schizoaffective,fmrmfqu,t3_fww28n,1586327798.0,"Wow I did not know so many people on this forum had negative experiences with dispersions, I have been off dispersions for about two months now and I have been having a substantial decrease in anxiety but I was on it for almost two years ranging from 5->1 MG. I had anxiety and paranoia and at bedtime I would cry and scream and talk to nobody in my room. I would have trouble slowing my thoughts especially at night because there is less to focus on and calm my mind. One thing that really helped me was listening to hz frequency music on YouTube and I would let it play on low volume to sleep. I am shocked at how I never thought it was the medication but rather myself/my condition that was causing these things. I’m truly thankful for your perspectives and that I found this"

Almost as if you can feel it coming, really scary and spooky for me but since I have gone through so many episodes I have more confidence that it will pass and that I can try to ground myself and be present in the moment"
selfhelp,flwb5zp,t3_frhua0,1585544838.0,"I can’t offer advice, I’m 22 and I wake up in the morning with an anxiety that I NEED to make the most of the day. I live an objectively well off life but I feel lonely and don’t feel/recognize my own self worth. I really hope you can find an answer that scratches that deep longing for something greater. I have looked to self help and people that are greater than I am and I try to learn from them. Whether it be objective goals like making money or greater things such as being humble and trying to love. My question is what matters to you the most? If it matters to you and it has longevity such as fitness or helping others then pursue it. Good luck! Also be careful of the fast paced lifestyle of the Bay Area, there are many other people that don’t live so fast and are amazing people"
schizoaffective,fehgt78,t3_eov5sm,1579116238.0,I used to feel this and other people’s side conversations would reflect some thought I had in my mind. All I can say is that my symptoms have calmed down for sure and that I am doing much better. The mind will try and find stimulus and signs that what you are thinking is true. Stay strong and try to remove yourself from those situations that stress and trigger you for the time being until symptoms calm down.
schizoaffective,fc1hm8j,t3_efnihi,1577319031.0,"Happy Holidays! It’s good that you are book smart, try doing some research on grounding techniques and things that make you happy. I struggle with self esteem and confidence issues and I get frustrated and beat myself up for not being able to socialize and be “normal”. My advice, learn how to love and be kind to yourself because I definitely find myself beating my self up and that doesn’t help in any way."
