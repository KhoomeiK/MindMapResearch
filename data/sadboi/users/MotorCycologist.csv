So from a personal standpoint, it made me cognizant of my issues and got me to seek help.  Since it's likely I'd be dead by now if I hadn't, that's a good thing.

Professionally, I've had a few times where I've been hospitalized and it has come in handy.  One of the more common questions I received was, ""What makes you *think* you have Borderline Personality?""  Every time I told them that a pair of psychiatrists thought I had it long before I did, their physical and audible demeanour would immediately change.  Theoretically, it shouldn't make a difference but it did."

* RA'd last year and have been invited back this year, assuming lockdown ends and lab can open.
* Me and two others are already tight and doing everything we can to make sure we all cross the stage together next year.
* I've been hitting as many courses as I can through the spring/summer (incl. this one) so apart from the thesis and thesis seminar (1/2 year), I only have one 1/2 year psych and one 1/2 year elective to finish my undergrad. That should give me more time for thesis/GRE/post-grad applications.

Instead of always staring at a screen on a video chat, she can just curl up on a couch, close her eyes, and listen to your voices through the phone.

As for the in-laws, something I was going to suggest anyways was a little bit of therapy.  New parents, trapped under COVID, and controlling in-laws can each cause stress on their own.  Put them together?  That's tough.  Next time you talk to your sister, tell her that a guy in Canada is proud of her for hanging in as well as she is.

There are therapists who deal with families and new parents as a whole, rather than just one person as a client, so they may want to consider that route.  Since her husband probably grew up in that same environment that the in-laws are now trying to raise the baby in, he likely wouldn't see anything wrong or controlling about it; he'd just see it as normal.  The therapist can help the two of them plan out how to raise the baby as their own, while telling his parents to back off a little, in a nice way.

When this is all over, give her a really, *really* big hug, okay?"

psychologystudents,fqqk3u7,t3_gk8qys,1589566916.0,"I wouldn't say ""Just as..."".  The difference is the transparency of the process.  Magicians use deception to fool the audience whereas (ethical) behaviourists document everything they did so that their experiments can be replicated by others.

A magician's end game is to make people believe that they really pulled a rabbit out of a perfectly normal, empty hat.  That's their ultimate goal in the act.

A behaviourist's end game is not to make rats run through mazes faster to get cheese or to teach pigeons to play ping-pong (although that would be a pretty cool party trick).  They ultimately want to be able to condition people to extinguish certain habits and positively reinforce others.

However, due to certain legal and ethical constraints (thank you, Stanely Milgram\*), experiments like that can't be done on humans.  So we use genetically similar animals as stand-ins for human subjects.  If I can get enough rats to choose the treadmill over the taco, it's plausible to believe that humans might as well.

So while the final results between a magician and a behaviourist may appear similar, I argue that the process and motivation between the two are vastly different.

psychologystudents,fqg5r6q,t3_gfsqir,1589338567.0,"I'm gonna break this down into sections to make it (hopefully) easier to read.

**Meet the Teacher**

1. Pick your #1 teacher
2. Email the teacher
3. Ask for a meeting to go over some questions from lecture # XX
4. Explain that you tried to get in during office hours, but they've been too busy.
5. Go through your online library system (you can probably access online journals through it), find a recent or major article of theirs, and skim over it.  At least know what it's about (i.e., know what they study).

Arranging the meeting shows that you are making an effort and want to do what it takes (i.e., going out of your way) to get better grades.  Few profs will turn that down.  Usually, they'll book it during off-hours, which gives you a little more time with them, too!

Professors are people; they like to know that someone's paying attention to their work, too.  So if you get a chance to bring up that research of theirs that you read, go for it.  Again, it shows that you do that little extra.

Once you've seen them once, do it again.  Keep it up until they walk past you in the hall and say hi to you by name.

&#x200B;

**Journal**

1. Pick a topic that interests you.
2. Go online to your school's library page (since they probably have subscriptions to journals).
3. Search for that topic.
4. Download the research PDF's.
5. Install a reference manager software (ones like Mendeley or Zotero are free).
6. Let the software sort the PDF's.
7. Read them at your leisure!

The easiest thing to search for is whatever convinced you to major in psychology in the first place.  As an example, like you, I've been diagnosed, so that's what I study.  I like to examine the behavioural, social, neurological, whatever!  They all intertwine, so the more I know, the better. (I'll admit, I'm really leaning toward neuropsychological.)

Personally, I'm more impressed by a person who knows a lot about a subject than a person who reads Journal X.  If you find a journal that focuses on what you like, then go for it, but I wouldn't suggest reading a journal just for the sake of reading one.

&#x200B;

**Internships**

Well, it's too late for an internship now, but here's an alternative.  Once this whole lockdown is over, talk to one of your profs (go back to that top section) about becoming a Research Assistant (RA).  I won't say it's glamourous; usually, it's just you doing your own homework while proctoring another undergrad who's playing lab rat for a post-grad or your professor.

But it qualifies as research experience on your resume. :)

&#x200B;

**Graduating Process**

Go into the Psych department.  There is probably an office or two labeled ""Academic Advisor""  or ""Undergraduate Advisor."" That's who you want to talk to.  If the door is open a crack, knock on it, and ask if they have a few minutes.  If it's closed and they have hours posted with an email address, take your phone out and send an email to that address right away to set up an appointment.

The person behind that door will be able to sit down with you, pull out a chart with all of your courses on it and say ""okay, here's what you have so far, and here's what you need to graduate.""  That's their job.

&#x200B;

**Post-Grad**

You can always re-take courses, to bump your grade up.  I know that keeps you in longer and means a bigger student loan at the end, but barring a slightly modified Delorean DMC-12 and a few pounds of plutonium, that's the only option I can think of.

This is also something you should talk to the academic advisor about.  Again, this is what they do!

3. Like Catman said, once the lockdown is over, start doing group rides first.  They're more casual and spaced out - if you haven't done many group rides before, this is a good thing.  If you like the relaxed approach of these rides, look for a Riding Club (RC); that's how they normally operate.

Inversely, if you have no desire or necessity to improve on something, you can choose to ignore it altogether, devoting your time and energy to other pursuits.  As a man once said, ""I can't swim, I know I can't! So you know what I do? I stay my...ass out the pool!""

In a practical sense, you match your passions up with your strengths and weaknesses.  You see what it would take to get where you want to be in life, without giving up what you feel would be an excessive amount (which in itself, requires you to decide your values and priorities in a very hard manner).  Take something like having a baby or leaving your current industry to go back to school to get your dream job, for example.

1. find anyone who would help someone with Borderline PD
   1. deal with the stigma of having BPD
2. deal with the stigma of being a guy, especially a biker, seeking mental help

3. If you can, try to do something physical and something mental each day.  You don't have to do a marathon followed by an SAT test, but something, anything, to get you moving and thinking.

Publicize it and you put them at greater risk of falling to suicide, themselves.

On the other hand, impartial news reporting is what news media is supposed to do, and suicide is news, regardless of its emotional valence.  Also, talking about it more may potentially reduce the stigma surrounding it, reducing suicides overall.

Learning the neurons is important, but (at least, in my class), learning the synapses was significantly more important!  Learn the parts & chemicals involved, the processes, action potentials, etc.

Talk to your local university (or maybe go through the library staff at your high school, for a little added muscle,) to see if there's a way for you to get access to the university's online system.  You may have to pay a small fee (as uni students do as part of their fees), but one of the perks of being a university student is that you have access to a large number of journals and ebooks through their library system.  You usually have to read the ebooks online (or can only download x number of pages), but you can download all of the research reports you want and read them at your convenience.

If you decide to download now/read later, I suggest you get Reference Manager software (there are free ones out there - work well, no ads, no spam).  It'll make it easier to keep tabs, and when you hit university, it'll be a lifesaver!"
psychologystudents,fnux34c,t3_g3vw8n,1587273446.0,"I think you're talking about the famous Stanley Milgram obedience study.  He had participants believe they were administering shocks to confederates (though the responses & cries were recorded) in an attempt to see how far people would go when ordered to.  He wanted to find out, when Nazis were killing people in the camps, how strongly obedience factored into it.

That said, you might want to look at the criticisms of his study as well, both in procedure and replication.  I'm not judging one over the other, but both sides are worth a look.

Here's the DOI for Milgram's experiment: doi:10.1037/h0040525"

But from what I was told by doctors when I was in my crash 10 years ago (and I wasn't even doing 30 mph), the helmet *reduced* my head injuries to skull fractures and brain damage.  Without a helmet, it's unlikely that I would have survived it."

Funny thing is, they wonder why we take an ""us against them"" attitude."
psychologystudents,fmyg0il,t3_fx3x3v,1586485283.0,"It's because of your prefrontal cortex (PFC).  The PFC is what performs the 'executive' thinking of your brain, bringing all of the information from other parts of your brain together and then deciding what needs to be further processed and acted on, and what is to be ignored.  If it didn't, we'd be overwhelmed by the time we got out of bed in the morning.

During REM sleep, the PFC drops into a very low state of activity.  The other parts of the brain, however, are still running normally.  With full input and a *very* diminished controller, the input runs wild like monkeys on acid...and you have dreams of pretty much the same thing.

That's also why, in people who have had TBI's from vehicle crashes, you often see anger issues and emotional dysregulation.  The emotions were always there, just like they are in everyone else, but with a diminished PFC to control it, they aren't regulated as tightly as they once were."

Clients will relate with you better, be more open with you, and have more faith in your suggestions since you've likely tried these methods yourself, rather than just read them in a book.

Besides, more and more, I'm finding that a lot of the people who get into this field have issues.  I think it's because we know how damaging our problem is and we don't want anyone else to have to suffer with it as we have."
BPD,fmvs8zv,t3_fxm4t2,1586428934.0,"Most days, it's relatively okay.  I did a few years of DBT, so I have learned to moderate some responses.  I find I still internalize a lot of others, though.  Honestly, my outlook hasn't changed much.  I'm trying to help other people as much as I can, but I still expect that I will quite likely die alone and by my own hand."
psychologystudents,fmtspqy,t3_fxdq3a,1586378345.0,"Stats is difficult, especially in the first half.  The professor will throw all the key formulas at you that you'll need to know, without explaining its purpose.  There's no real way around it.  Later, once you've learned the formulas, then they'll start meshing them all and everything will start becoming clearer.

So just plow through the first half, make good use of the TA's and professor's office hours (i.e., be there as often as they are), stay on top of the homework, and you'll be fine."

1. go to **Analyze** \> **Correlate** \> **Bivariate**.
2. Highlight GENDER in the left box, then click the right arrow to move it to the right box.Repeat with EISAQ.
3. Click the **OPTIONS** button in the top right of that window.
   1. Ensure that ""Means and standard deviations"" is checked.  Click **CONTINUE**.
4. On the correlations window, ensure that ""Pearson"" coefficients is checked, as is ""Flag significant correlations.""
5. **Paste** it into your syntax.
6. Highlight that section of syntax and click the green **RUN** button.  Make sure to save your syntax - your prof will probably want to see it, too.

It sounds a lot more complicated than it is.  Most of the steps are just double-checking to make sure that certain things that should be checked by default, are.

I just did a mockup using your variables, so you can see what a significant correlation output looks like.

psychologystudents,fmia81n,t1_fmduvx8,1586105533.0,"The testing is pretty straight forward.  Usually, it's just a clinical interview.  It may be structured, semi-structured or unstructured, which just refers to how prepared the questions are in advance.  Unstructured lets you follow what's bothering the client more easily, though it sometimes makes it harder to get specific details to differentiate between two diagnoses.

As for medication and therapy, those really depend on exactly which PD you're researching.  While there may be some crossover between PD's with regards to meds/therapies (more likely meds, as almost everyone gets SSRI's nowadays), it's unlikely that a person with Narcissistic PD is going to need the same meds or therapy for low self-esteem that a person with Borderline PD would."
psychologystudents,fmi59bt,t1_fmadkkt,1586102694.0,"Yes, you interpreted it right!

One thing to notice is that, when I talked about them having ""an effect,"" I didn't say any direction (relative to each other), and that's where I was going with it.  The less you actually say/imply, the less you have to back.  As one professor jokingly told me, ""if you write your own name in a paper, you'd better cite your mother, 'cause she said it first.""

Start to finish, here's how I'd write the line:

""In other words, external factors and the person *both have effects* as socializing agents in the development of that person.""

OR

""In other words, external factors and the person *both \[act/function\]* as socializing agents in the development of that person.""

Now that I read it, I like the second one better.  It sounds cleaner."

psychologystudents,fm6rsk6,t3_ftfb0s,1585801441.0,"Some professors may get picky, some may not.  I'll play devil's advocate and get picky.

Saying that they work *mutually* implies that they have a cumulative effect (i.e., both are just as strong) as socializing agents, with unilateral direction.

Saying that they work *together* can be either a cumulative or interactive effect, but still denotes a unilateral direction.

Saying that ""both *have an effect* as"" socializing agents only says that they affect socializing agents.  No power, no direction, nothing to be questioned about.  Just, ""yep, these changed it.""

Personally, I'd go with ""*have an effect on*"", unless you know the level and direction of effect that each has, in which case, you can get specific.

That's just my 2¢.  Sorry, no refunds."

psychologystudents,fm67tv8,t3_fta9so,1585788132.0,"All the Results section is, is walking the reader through your analysis process:

* Data exclusions, if any (make sure to give a valid reason).
* What test(s) you ran on the data
* What results you found and if any were significant
   * any post hoc tests performed on significant results
* Include most of your figures/tables here or append them to the end (ask your prof)
   * Make SURE these are all APA-compliant, too!!

Explain them in a logical order, as a normal human (i.e., non-researcher) would read them.  Say you did a multiple regression with A, B, and C on D, and each one had a main effect, *plus* there was a big interaction between all of them (if it did, you scored big), start with the individual main effects.  Say the effect of each one on their own so when we read the interaction, we understand its impact.

This isn't the time to explain *why* anything is the way it is, just explain *what* it is.  Leave why for the Discussion section.

The biggest thing here is to make sure that your results are all properly formatted in APA.  Check if your prof wants APA 6 or 7 (6 is still in widespread academic use).

Most people like to report p-values as *p* < .05 or *p* < .01.  Personally, I prefer to show the actual p-value; if you do like I do, make sure to announce early on if you're using .05, .01, or another value as your alpha, so there's no confusion."

2. You will.  You may have to think a little out of the box to get what you're after (e.g., there may not have specific data for your country in rural v. urban, but look at your country overall, then compare similar countries' urban and rural contrasts).
3. That's up to your professor.  They should have given you a minimum page/word count in the rubric.  If one wasn't given, ask him/her.  Better to ask than to guess.
4. Things you SHOULD probably do (to avoid doing things you'll get docked for):
   1. Find out if your professor wants APA 6 or 7 (a lot still want 6).
   2. Keep your paper on point. Read it, re-read it, and re-re-read it.
   3. Do the same for your results.  Even worse than going off-topic in your intro is screwing up your results and basing your entire discussion on a type-1.
