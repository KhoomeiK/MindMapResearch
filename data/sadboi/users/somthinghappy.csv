Try to do some small changes in your day to day and see if it helps.

BodyDysmorphia,f5jij29,t1_f5jhacu,1572229537.0,"We have so much and it gets really ugly. This thing happens last year at a party where he was being really flirty with a girl (this is the first and last time in 4 years) right in front of me. We were all playing heads up and our team won then he scooped her up twice and then msged her in snap chat after we got home. It was awkward, her boyfriend was right there and it wasn’t like the feeling was mutual on her part. This rocked my mental state. She is really pretty Spanish curvy girl. 

A year later I still hold it over him. He really didn’t cheat or anything but I’m like forever broken. I want to move past it. We have kids. 

He’s very aware of all of my feelings as I’ve expressed them from a very calm place to a really angry place. 

This will calm down and I’ll feel better and think I’m past it and then I’ll see he was looking at some worldstar model and I go back into this spiral feeling like I’m not good enough. He doesn’t respect me yadayada. 

This thing that happened was wrong, he was wrong. He hurt me and he knows that. But I think he does love me. He has tried and he’s stayed through every breakdown. 

I want to move on for my family I want to love myself enough to not need his opinion be my only value. I just need help with coping with these feeling and this jealousy."
BodyDysmorphia,f5jhhpg,t1_f5jgngl,1572228682.0,"I don’t think I explained it clearly. He’s not checking there’s girls out when we’re out... or at least not looking at them like in an obvious way. If I see a girl who is “his type” I watch him closely and make sure his eyes don’t travel in that direction - I know what I’m doing is unhealthy and I know it makes home feel weird. But I can’t help but make sure he’s not looking. 

And as far as Instagram and porn I want to say that it’s pretty normal for a guy to do that - I guess the fact that they are a type is hurtful. But everything I read say that it’s not that important at the end of the day and that loads of people are happy with someone that isn’t their “type”. - but it does put a weight on how I feel about how I look. 
And as much as I want to blame him and say he’s the reason I feel this way I can’t, it’s not his fault. 

Before him I was still insecure and didn’t really have confidence in how I looked or just who I am. There are times I felt super cute or liked how I looked but I’ve always had insecurities with boyfriends around other pretty women."

You gotta get out of your head. Your on a path that only allows you to be a victim, you need to be there for yourself. You need to love yourself more, if not you than who? 

Maybe work on the type of person you would like have in your life and be that. How would they treat others? How would they treat them self? How would they begin the day. I really really struggle with happiness too, and some times I can get into 3 day long self loathing rants. But when I think about who I want to be and how to act more like the person I would like to be it helps. 

Do you like animals? Maybe you can volunteer at a shelter or maybe help homeless. It feels nice to do something that helps others. 

What are you doing to make yourself feel good? If it’s only self serving the good feeling won’t last, help others and you’ll feel better about the person that you are."

Your sister and your cousins are not as fortunate and can’t see past themselves. They’re selfish. I’m not sure why they lost their kids but that doesn’t usually happen to people who aren’t messing up in life. $80 a week is nothing. They need to help you and provide for the household. Are drugs involved? 

Basically, It’s ok to help others but not if  when it’s going to harm you, as in affect your life, or your state of mind. If breaking away from them is going to give you a better quality of life you need to do that. You’ve had a tough life so far. You deserve better. 

Also some people will never gain independence when they have a crutch, you not helping them might make them better people and they can learn to rely on themselves.

So what are you doing to change all this? What effort do you put into making friends or “being likable”? 

Have you tried joining an after school program or sports team? This will put you in a situation where you need to be social and it’s small enough groups where you won’t feel too overwhelmed. 

Sports is a great way to boost your self esteem while making friends. Try to stay busy so you have less time to focus on depression and self pitying.
