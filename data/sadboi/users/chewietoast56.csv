   Recently, my stepdad and mom kicked me out of my home. I donâ€™t have any family that I could move in with and my dad is in the Phillippines and is stuck there because of the corona virus spread. 
Iâ€™m only 17 and I donâ€™t have much saved up. I have a car, which I loaded with all my belongings. Itâ€™s a really scary time for me and I have no idea where to go. I feel like itâ€™s easier to kill myself than suffer through this. My friends have been supportive and have offered to let me stay with them. But I donâ€™t know how their parents would feel with having another kid in the house. Iâ€™ve been thinking of suicide but Iâ€™m honestly way too scared to do it, and itâ€™s more of a last resort if I donâ€™t figure out how to better my situation. I live in California and itâ€™s really expensive here in the bay. Any suggestions?"
