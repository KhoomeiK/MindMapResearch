Season 1 Ep. 8 The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti

When Christopher shoots the bakery kid's foot, it's a nod to his major first role in a film. In Goodfellas, in which he played Spider, a waiter who was accidentally shot in the foot by a short-tempered gangster (Joe Pesci)

Richard Melfi states ""Goodfellas was a good movie."" He says it to Dr. Melfi who plays Henry Hills Wife, Karen in the film.

Rumor has it when Tony kisses Dr. Melfi in her office, she backs up and smiles, but it's odd and out of place. When Tony goes in to kiss her, a crew member yells ""DROP THE GUN KAREN!"" and she is laughing during the scene."

I am grateful for his actions.

As hypocritical as it sounds with my previous posts, I do the house work and laundry... BUT I work from home every day, he has a 2 hour daily commute. If he cooked dinner we would be eating at 10pm and I can't live with that with our current schedules.

We went to my folks and he tried to clean up after himself and my mother scolded me for not being ""hands on deck"" and ready to grab his empty dish.

I asked him if his arm was broken. He laughed. My Mom got pissed at me LOL

We have a mutual respect and realize that household chores need to happen daily, it does seem we take on the more ""traditional"" gender roles when it comes to the domestic work  load.

In my Father's defense, he did work our entire lives around 13 hours a day, 6 days a week. He provided for 6 children so my mother COULD stay home with us, there is mutual respect and love there. However, when I used to visit them both, I did laugh at my Dad trying to clean the house, he thought Windex cleaned every piece of furniture and I never saw so much take out food in my life ,while my mother recuperated.  I came in and took the reigns (and I am the daughter, so again, the woman keeps the home attitude) and I made them weekly hot meals and brought them over. I will say a year later, my Dad does all the laundry, and he cleans up and cares for the pets daily, and he loads the dishwasher now. It's progress!

EDIT: I noticed a few people chiming in with their family's ethnic backgrounds and I have to confirm as well. My Father is Italian (I am a First Gen Kid) and my grandmother would die before she let any male person in her home lift a finger.  My Mother is also from a family where the woman did it all.. It certainly spilled into our upbringing. I have older 4 brothers and they don't do much around the house. It's really a disservice and they will throw their hands up,  play dumb and infantile themselves.  I find this unhealthy and wish my mother demanded more. I learned how to cook and clean at age 9 because I would ""marry one day"".... Yes, it's the wrong way to raise us I admit, and when I was young I did not know any better.

I would have to train them the way I liked the office to run, then maybe take a family event (small weekend) type of trip.

It’s when an Italian moves up / out to Greenwich, CT and marries money, or becomes a DR.. then even goes so far to Anglo their name to make it sound more “American” if I changed my name to “Morton” to get accepted into the country clubs.

They escape their past, their try to blend in with “Americans”...

I never understood this but my age is showing, I’m now 40 and my Dad said this was more common during his era.

Barb doesn’t want to be involved with her family. She barely talks to anyone. She has a new life."

thesopranos,f7k37bn,t3_dvhrcw,1573793404.0,"Meadow. I grew up in Bergen Co NJ and we are almost the same age when this aired. My dad owns warehouses in NJ and we are Italian. We had a home just like theirs in Saddle River. I was given a very comfortable home. My dad worked like a dog to provide for 6 kids and to be honest, we all gave him crap like Tony got from his family. Our lives are very parallel in the time line, what The Sopranos has material wise, and how they acted. We had the same type of furniture... even Carl’s multi colored painted coffee mugs, my mom still has. It’s kind of eerie to watch now, bc of such similar settings. My Dad is not associated like Tony but he grew up around those people, and we see them all at weddings and funerals to this day. They give gifts and send cards. My father did all he could to not get into business with anyone like that in his supply chain businesses for the past 45 years. He told me he’s been hustled a few time but his “a friend of ours” told those type of people to pass on his businesses. The only connection to any of that is me. My Godfather is someone that had the cops come and check our house from time to time. They took pictures of my going to kindergarten.. they would stop by and ask my Dad questions at 7am. This life is very real and I love this show. In saying that, it glamorizes things that are scary and dangerous."

povertyfinance,f7id25b,t3_dw34c2,1573757440.0,"I agree with the room about the car/ loan payments, way too high.. look into those. About food. $500 a month, does this include dining out/ take out? Check Walmart, Aldi, Saveway, hell even food banks for discounts, they are all much cheaper. No shame in going to a food bank for your canned goods, even frozen for a few months, that is why they are there. Look into meal prepping and freezing, slow cooking. It does save time and money. If you can buy meat in bulk, cut it all down and rebag it, you can get say a full sleeve of chicken breasts for $10 @ Aldi, and you get 11 breasts out of it. I took my loans and went to a consolidator and then applied for income driven plan and I pay $300 a month. See if you can bring your current phones over to a Cricket type of plan, all unlimited for $45 a month each phone plus they have family plans :)"

What you describe as your daily life, I experience as well (as far as barricading rooms and being afraid).  I am going to be blunt, my life is terrible. I am highly functioning on medication, but the side effects are just horrible.  I am not violent, but I do freak out from voices and hallucinations after days, with no stopping. You can only take so much. I have ""White Noise"" in the background of my brain 24/7... the meds don't cure it, only sort of quiet them. Even then, the meds don't always work and I am afraid of my own home. In saying this, I would never have a child. It's too cruel to knowingly make a child and they could have this mental illness. I feel your wife is minimizing your mental health and is only thinking of the ""good things"" a child will bring in her world.  While I am an advocate to stop the stigma of seeing this mental illness as some SVU TV character, I also am in full support of showing what real life is living with it. ""Normalizing"" Schizophrenia and ""Candy coating"" it are two different things.. Yes we are normal people, yes we can live, love, work and thrive.. but.. it's so difficult and to want to pass this on to another human being is not a good idea. :("

thesopranos,f6xd7w8,t1_f6v0bir,1573247222.0,"I asked my Dad since he’s Italian and my Mother is Russian. His answer was that many Russian women come from hardship so they know how to survive. They are independent for the most part and they see life with a “you do what you have to do” attitude, similar to Italians.

He also did say that he has met many girls like Irina. Needy, money hungry, revengeful.

In saying this, he did add that the women are gorgeous and make you feel like you’re the only man in the room at a public event.

My dad is 65 and I thought this was an interesting answer.

He did also say that, my mother’s family is not affectionate or warm like Italians. They are cold, they see love as something different.

He said raising us over the years, he had to actually show my mother how to hug and kiss us more.

It’s not her fault, she just comes from a completely different culture."

thesopranos,f6lv6ri,t3_drra9w,1572961777.0,"I completely agree. When I was 18, this show aired. I was living in Bergen Co NJ.. so it's all we saw all over the TV, news, newspapers. We saw the live tapings all over the county. As an First Gen Italian American, I felt so much pride. I was around Meadow's age, etc.....

I just finished the last episode last night after a month binge.

I feel really upset over this show now.. and to be blunt ashamed of my family.  We were very similar to this growing up in every detail. It makes me want to vomit.

The ignorance of mental illness, the racism, then narcissistic attitudes. The cursing, the fighting, then 'eat you will feel better.""

I am one of 6 kids, and the sons in my family could do no wrong, and the girls ""Could just get married""... it was endless as I watched this over again, 15 years later. :(

The jokes about sobriety hit me as well. ""It's a discipline problem""... that was shitty of all of them to make fun of Christopher.

When Carm gets ""Sick of everyone's depression card."" that made me cry, I was raised by that.

As annoying as Meadow was for a few seasons, I can't lie, that is how we all were at that age in my ethnic town.. Our parents were very comfortable and we were just brats... we all had jobs in school, but we didn't need them. As I turn 40 this year, it just reminded me of how we great up, and I can't believe it was this way.

Anyway, just my thoughts... I used to idolize this show, and now I don't know if I will be able to get through the whole series again.

Edit: I wanted to add, as kids, we never cursed at our parents, they would yell at each other.  We would storm off and be sarcastic.. if we said ""Fuck you"" to our dad, I wouldn't be writing this today.  I saw AJ do this a few times in the show and we all held our breath, out of fear."

You can make a big casserole.. I like making Shepard’s pie. You can get instant mashed for $1, frozen veggies for $1 and ground beef for about $4 (here in the US). A large platter makes about five meals?

Dollar Tree Grocery has Frozen is very good, for budgets!

Pasta and sauce is always cheap.

Chicken leg quarters are great too! At Walmart here $7 buys you a bag of about 8, and they are large.

Mac N Cheese is also great. You can buy the ones with the creamy sauces for about $2 a box, they make about 4 portions. You can add more milk, cheese and even some beef, and stretch it further.

Good luck!"
