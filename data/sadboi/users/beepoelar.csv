bipolar,fmyz82u,t3_fy2fys,1586500565.0,"YO yes but sometimes I didn‚Äôt even realize I was being confrontational, I just thought the person wasn‚Äôt understanding because if they understood they‚Äôd definitely agree with me (was my thinking)"

bipolar,fk1au0c,t1_fjys1tz,1583775915.0,"I appreciate your responses. I did look up BPD earlier and it doesn‚Äôt quite jive, I don‚Äôt think. I‚Äôve already been diagnosed bipolar type 2, and bipolar runs in my family. But my overall experiences don‚Äôt really jive with bipolar 2 unless my depressive episodes are one big mixed episode."

bipolar2,eu09hxe,t3_ce8dxn,1563344066.0,"Hey I feel that burning the candle from both ends at work thing.

I did it last week. It felt great the first day and the night in which I didn‚Äôt sleep, and felt pretty good on my way into work on the second day (going on no sleep), but then I hit a wall by 9 am and my productivity tanked. Mood followed"
bipolar2,etzfyje,t1_etx5fqq,1563331265.0,How did you end up @ the beach?
bipolar,etzfk1e,t3_ce3hdp,1563331109.0,that moment when you‚Äôre both ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
bipolar2,etwnn76,t1_etvyvd1,1563278434.0,"Confirmed. Hot damn. You know, growing up, people would ask me sometimes if I was high. I was always like, ‚Äúnah, my brain‚Äôs just naturally high‚Äù (because I am (or was?) generally in a better mood and had more energy than most). 

Little did I know how true that was"
bipolar2,etvux04,t1_etvr3z5,1563245362.0,"That sounds really challenging for sure. How long ago were you diagnosed? 

I think that almost everyone is affected by the differing seasons in terms of mood. It makes sense that it would affect those of us with mood disorders even more. I have read that it is typical for manic episodes to occur in the spring and depressions in the fall/winter. It makes perfect sense, really. So yeah, I‚Äôd agree that the sun is a big part of it. 

I mean, think of the summer. The sun is out for so many more hours. It‚Äôs much easier for your brain to be convinced that it doesn‚Äôt need as much sleep‚Äîlook outside, it‚Äôs still light, the night is young!"
bipolar2,etvufva,t1_etvpup8,1563245013.0,"I understand why you might not want to ask, but, knowing for a fact that it‚Äôs in your family history can be very helpful to a psychiatrist in diagnosing, if appropriate.

I will say that in my personal experience and seeing my own brothers‚Äô experiences, panic attacks have not been commonplace. Mental breakdowns from exhaustion/stress/overstimulation, maybe. That‚Äôs not to say that you couldn‚Äôt have bipolar disorder and an anxiety disorder mixing together at the same time.

Why did you stop taking Lexapro? (I had to Google that one)"
bipolar2,etvllgt,t1_etvisyr,1563238579.0,"Thank you. I‚Äôm in the unique position of already being educated about my disorder before being diagnosed with it, and having seen how bad it can get first hand. Otherwise, I doubt I would have been appropriately afraid of going full blown manic.

Too much sun? How‚Äôs that? 

It‚Äôs good to hear from someone else who rapid cycles. I guess I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs what I really am on the spectrum, rather than type II."
bipolar2,etvgx4i,t1_etv0lkg,1563235105.0,"New to reddit here. I wanted to downvote your post bc of disliking what your mom is doing, then realized that would mean downvoting you!"
bipolar2,etvfho7,t1_esmgjfk,1563234031.0,Good god this is so true (although I haven‚Äôt tried MDMA.. can you or someone else confirm??)
