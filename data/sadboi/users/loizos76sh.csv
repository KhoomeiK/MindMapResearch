mentalhealth,fmpwcr7,t3_fwqyty,1586288538.0,"When I first read your question I thought that your friend was joking about his own insecurities. If you're the one making the jokes, then make sure that for whatever insecurity your friend is having, he's totally dealt with it and it's past him. But even on this occasion, since every person is different, I can't really know how your friend will perceive it. 

So my advice is to chat with him. An honest conversation with a friend can be really cathartic. Even if your friend is struggling with his insecurity, talking with him could really help him get it out of his chest.

That's the best advice I can give you. Thanks for sharing, I hope everything works out."
mentalhealth,fmpv0zt,t3_fwqo91,1586287845.0,"I recognize that stage that you are in right now. My first advice would be to acknowledge and deal with these thoughts that you're having. Let go of your piled up thoughts and uncluttered that mind of yours.

From what you're telling I'm assuming that you've lost the meaning of life. It's an existential crisis that most of us in here been or currently going through. It's hard for anyone to find meaning in life, simply because there isn't one. It's just the ""harsh"" truth. Although by this time I don't see it as harsh at all. There isn't something you're meant to be nor to do. You are just here to experience life and to live it.

So what you should do is find the things that allow you to experience life the most. For me, these things are the people. The only thing that matters for me in life is the people and the relationships we create with each other."
mentalhealth,fmptgtk,t3_fwqi6l,1586287032.0,"I think that the first move is not to immediately stop the things that you're ashamed of. First of you should try and understand the reason you are ashamed of those things. Because in my opinion what you do is just experiencing your sexuality and there's nothing wrong with this. The fact that you feel shameful of it, might be caused by the suppression of those feelings when they initially emerged. This could be due to the environment that you grew up in, or simply the image and idea of what you think of your self. 

As a male, I can say to you that indeed most of us get a depressed-like feeling after the act of masturbation. It's totally normal especially if you haven't had a sexual partner for a while. Don't be ashamed nor mad about it."
mentalhealth,fmprnst,t3_fwmc9j,1586286092.0,"Times like this are really rough. Experiencing anxiety is normal if you manage and keep it under control. So that is what I'm suggesting. Try and maintain control before it consumes every thought and action of yours. 

Our mental strength, in such situations where we don't have any control of the outcome, is the most important thing. Acknowledge the possibilities to get grounded into reality and to focus on what you can achieve in the time being, not to get more anxious about it. 

I would suggest to you, if you haven't already, read about Buddhism. The teachings of Buddha are about life and how to properly experience it and perceive it. Start by reading about the four noble truths. It really helped me when I needed it.

Thank you for sharing"
mentalhealth,fmppnxe,t3_fwo8vr,1586285075.0,"You are very right to think that it should be ok to talk about things like that. But most people are just uncomfortable with such conversations. Although the reason might be different from what you think. I think most of them deeply know that this cause of death is sadly present. The reason they might react in such a way is that they might just don't really know what to say or how to respond to a conversation like that. 

If you feel like you're ok with telling people then there's nothing wrong with it and I totally agree with you. Just expect the fact that the person you're talking too will probably get caught off guard."

mentalillness,fmhm7sz,t3_fusl40,1586085961.0,"This reminds me of my therapy experience. I'm truly grateful for my therapist because throughout my therapy she never said to me phrases like ""you suffer from..."" or ""that is \[some mental illness\]..."". 

She never put a label on me even though it was clear even to me what I was suffering from. By doing that I think she made it easier for me not to attach too much to illness, but to get closer to who I am and realize that having problems or going through stuff doesn't change who you are. 

On the occasion where you heard those phrases then I want you to know this: Having an illness does not mean that you are solely just an illness. It means that you are the person that you've always been and you're just experiencing difficulties. It's something that can happen to anyone and it's what reality consists of.

You shouldn't surround yourself with the thought of having an illness. You should acknowledge it and realize that with the time you'll grow and get stronger. 

I have a disorder. And what that means is that the ""default"" instruction manual won't work for assembling my life. I have to find my own. That's the only difference."
mentalillness,fmhgrd6,t3_fuzp4c,1586079467.0,"This was like reading my own thoughts, written down by someone else. In the past, I've come to a point where I've been so mad at myself and hated who I was, to the point that I chose to not look into mirrors because of how much I've despised that guy. 

I was like this until I've experienced something like what you're saying right now. I realized what a happy and carefree kid I was. I didn't care about anything and anyone. Things just couldn't get under my skin. It struck me so hard because, at that time, a single comment could hunt me for days. I suddenly felt so sorry for what I've done to that little kid instead of being angry with what my past self has done to my present self.

Since then I've managed to learn how to truly love myself and I've been amazed by how much I'm capable of. 

I now try to give that little kid's the future that he deserves and learn from every single thing that I've done wrong instead of being mad at me for being human and making mistakes."
SuicideWatch,fmg17bx,t1_fmfxvbl,1586039123.0,"Do you wanna know my theory as to why we do this?

I've spent a lot of time thinking about why I get so lost in my own head. My first thought was that I just wasn't happy with the life that I'm living. And sure it might be a big role as to why I do it but it's not the whole reason. 

I might be unsatisfied with how my life is right now but why do I keep on daydreaming instead of changing things? I think that it's because I (and so do every one of us) am so overinformed about everything that is happening to the world (through social media etc.) that I'm constantly reminded of the things I didn't achieve instead of realizing the things that I'm capable of achieving.

What I mean is that we constantly see what every person that we've ever met is doing instead of seeing our lives in front of us. So we've slowly built the habit of experiencing someone else's life and that's why our minds keep on drifting to that imaginary world where we live a different life.

I hope what I said makes sense and helps you a little bit. It helped me"
SuicideWatch,fmfzi2g,t3_fuy7j5,1586038112.0,"I really hope that you can still read this. Because that was what saved me from manifesting those thoughts into actions, after my first incident. 

We've all thought of life as being a straight line. In which each and every one of us walks towards the end. Life is nothing like a line. Life, and everything in it, is a circle. In this world that we live in, life and death are not the two endpoints of a straight line. They are not the start and end of a line. They are the start point and end point of a circle. 

They are the exact same point.

They are so alike that even the best of us can confuse them sometimes. What you want is life and peace, not death. You want the world to get a little quiet so that you can think clearly. You want for the time to stop so that you can slow down and rest. You see how these things can also seem like death to you. And I know how you can be so confused that you think that in order to achieve them, you'll have to die. But you don't have to and you don't want to. You want to live. Each and every one of us that tried to do it, in reality, we all wanted to live. 

But right now you're confused, as I once was. If I can tell you one thing, is that I promise you that things will get better, even though I know that it seems like a never-ending story. You'll find peace and you'll find joy. And if you need anyone to talk to, please, talk to me. I know you because I thought what you think."
SuicideWatch,fmfxktw,t3_fuygxq,1586036953.0,"Constantly. I've often found myself so submerged in those thoughts and scenarios that an hour could go by and I'd still be inside my head talking.

mentalhealth,fm1uzu5,t3_fsjrkf,1585685496.0,"I really hope that I can help you. Firstly, I want to share with you my personal experience of these days. I too have suffered in the past with mental illness and continue to face it whenever it comes back. When I first started seeing a therapist it was because it came down to a point that it was unbearable. What I've learned from that experience was that mental illnesses might never truly go away. Once it comes, it will also probably stay. That sounds pretty pessimistic, so why should someone hear this? Because although the illness might never leave, you can learn to manage it.

What I mean is that seeing a therapist really helps, but what makes the difference, in the end, is you. I've suffered from depression and anxiety (the real ones, not those that people use for memes online) for almost 7 years now (I'm 24). But if you ask me how I'm doing I will honestly answer that I'm doing great. Because I am. And that's because I know that in the end, I will overcome it.

I've stalled for a while and I'm sorry about that. What I want to say is that you have to know that whatever comes, however ugly it seems, you can overcome it. And you can overcome it with or without a therapist. A therapist is just a ""tool"" (in a good way) and you are the one who will manifest what you wish for. Whatever you've learned from your therapist you can apply it alone too. But if you really want to cry then do it, don't let it pile up inside of you, because later, a time might come that all this crying, that you once had to do (and didn't), will emerge as something you have no idea how to deal with.

What you can do while you are in quarantine is to express your feelings. Write them down to a journal. Sing them out with a song. Talk them out to a friend/family. And all that energy you have to burn, burn it. Burn it with reading, studying, exercising. It's a very tricky situation what's going on right now, and many people will come out broken out of this, just because they let all those things pile up.

Feelings and energy, show them a way out, don't let them pile."
todoist,flmvezr,t3_fpb0ee,1585298298.0,"I'll try to answer your questions as best as I can.

Generally, a task can be as simple as to ""take the trash out"", which requires only one thing to be done. But in the case that a task requires more than one thing to be done in order to be marked as ""complete"" you will need some subtasks also. Todoist refers to subtasks as ""steps to complete a task"", that is the steps you need to take to complete it. So yes you can actually use subtasks for grocery shopping because in order for your grocery shopping to be complete you'll need to get those items off the list.

If you don't want the subtasks to show up individually in your ""Today"" view than don't add a date to them. Add a date only to the parent task and you can access your subtasks from there. 

Regarding the sections. Sections are for projects that have multiple aspects, i.e. I might have a project going on that it's about developing an app. The development of an app consists of many things, from design to implementation and testing. These things will be marked as ""sections"" of my project and each will have their corresponding tasks.

I hope I managed to answer your questions. In the beginning, I found it useful to wonder around the Todoist website, they have a lot of useful info there."

Mindfulness,fkb8jld,t3_fhgylx,1584028251.0,"This was one of the most well put explanations as to what mindfulness really is. Mindfulness is to regain the inner control of ourselves by acknowledging what happens inside. By doing this we take back the control that outside ""forces"" had over us, and thus putting ourselves in a position of a better understanding and judgement of a situation. This does not mean that we have the power to change situations that are obviously out of our control. It means that we now can act in a way that will maximize the possibilities of a better outcome, both mentally and physically, in situations like these."
Mindfulness,fimm76a,t3_f8ge95,1582536714.0,"From my personal experience, in multiple occasions I have found myself putting on music just so that I can silence, to a degree, the thoughts that kept on stressing me out at the moment. There's nothing wrong with putting music playing in the background, but the reason I was doing it was wrong. 

You see, when you have the type of thoughts that keep hunting you, the worst thing you can do is to foolishly think that you can make them go away by suppressing them. Your thoughts are there for a reason and they have to be dealt with. If you ignore or suppress them, then they'll pile up into an unmanageable form of stress and anxiety. 

Now I'm saying you this, because I'm trying to see through your question. You wouldn't ask if there's something wrong with putting music in the background if you didn't feel that something's wrong. So my advice is, to clarify to yourself the reason you're doing it. If the reason is because it truly brings you joy, then you're all good and you have nothing to worry about. If the reason is to mask something else then find a way to deal with that ""something else"" and then you'll know exactly what to do. 

Thank you for sharing it, and if you have any other question feel free to ask me to clarify it."
