Dumb old me decided to cook pot muffins on New Year and eat three of them at once because... why not? I had been a smoker already, I thought it would be fine. A friend was with me, cooked with me and ate the same amount. A few hours later, we were both tripping so hard, panicking, completely fucking high. The pain was excruciating. Every nerve of my body felt like it was being poked by a needle. I had visual and audio hallucinations. I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking, I couldn‚Äôt talk correctly, I could only try to lay down and sleep. My friend was in the same state. 
The next morning we were both still pretty high but at least not hurting anymore.

My friend has been suffering from tinnitus since then and the both of us started having panic attacks after this event. I have been scared of cannabis ever since, I‚Äôll only use a tiny amount to relax. I really hope your sister doesn‚Äôt have any repercussion from this! :("

What a great son/daughter you are, as well as your siblings. As a mom, I felt personally touched by your gesture. Many people would‚Äôve kept the affair a secret or would have threatened to blackmail their dad to obtain whatever they might want. You thought of your mother‚Äôs feelings, her integrity and dignity before anything which is very respectful. I am sure she will always be grateful that her babies had her back there even if it meant putting themselves in an uncomfortable position. Bravo to you as well as your brothers. She must be so proud of you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

P.s.: I know not everyone has a great relationship with their moms and not all moms feel this way. I wish it was the case.

The start 3-4cm felt like period cramps mixed with the type of stomachache you get when you‚Äôre gonna have diarrhea. 5-6cm was a tad more painful but I could still walk, talk, joke... That‚Äôs when I decided to go to the hospital though because my contractions were 1-2 minutes apart and had been like this for an hour and a half. The hospital was literally next to my place so I got there quickly, walked to the fifth floor, even winked at someone who gave me a cheers through the hallway. Had to stop a few times to collect myself but was fine. They put me in the delivery room, I was about 6 and a half cm dilated and... 

My water broke. And then in about 10 minutes, I was at 9cm. And at this point, I can‚Äôt even talk except to beg for the epidural. I remember holding the metal bars of the bed and shaking, my whole body shaking in pain. They say the pain changes once the water breaks and for me it was totally true... It felt like NOTHING I had ever felt before and I‚Äôve been through plenty of painful experiences in my life but I don‚Äôt have very painful period cramps in life though. 
The pain felt like... you are about to pop out a watermelon and this watermelon is stabbing every single nerve in your belly/back/chest/uterus. I remember thinking ‚ÄúI need to cry! I need to open my eyes and take my partner‚Äôs hand!‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt even cry, I couldn‚Äôt open my eyes, I couldn‚Äôt move my hands away from those metal bars. I stayed at 9cm for what seemed like hours when it was probably barely 35 minutes. 

The thing with contractions though is that at one point, your body KNOWS it needs to push and you can‚Äôt help but push. I started pushing without the doctor, I couldn‚Äôt freaking stop and pushing felt so damn good. It was such a relief from the pain even though I could feel my vagina was starting to burn and rip. Everyone was screaming at me to stop pushing and I just... couldn‚Äôt. 

The worst pain though? Those fucking 3 weeks after childbirth where your ripped vagina keeps bleeding and it full of that awful mucus. I cried so hard every time I needed to pee or poop. I couldn‚Äôt walk. I had 33 stitches and it was the most awful experience of my life. Also, those fucking horrible cramps once you start breastfeeding and your uterus is working on shrinking back. They lasted like on and off 2 weeks for me and were really awful. 

Would totally do all of it again because I love being a mom even though it‚Äôs so hard. It‚Äôs the most gratifying experience ever!"
