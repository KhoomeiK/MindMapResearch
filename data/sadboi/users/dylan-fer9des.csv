stopsmoking,f6ndpk3,t3_drn5gq,1572989397.0,"Your commitment to want to quit smoking is commendable. This proves that you acknowledge that smoking is not the best thing for your  body. Many people I know are less fortunate to acquire this wisdom. You've made the right decision and obviously it's because you want to choose a healthier life. Smoking will only do harm to the body and if you choose to live longer, the body is the only vehicle we have to enable us to travel this  long journey. It thus makes sense to feed the body with the right kind of fuel."
stopsmoking,f6ncp3t,t3_drtz7a,1572988812.0,"A relapse, in my opinion is necessary. How else would you know the difference between how shitty a cigarette a makes you feel versus how comfortable you feel breathing and clear headed you become after you quit. Our body is the only vehicle we have to take us through this journey of life, it makes sense to feed it the right kind of fuel."
