I've been recently diagnosed and I feel like I've used up all my deep conversations with them and they wouldn't  understand, I'm an adult now and dealing with my mental health alone without them is significantly easier and more manageable."

Thank God because turns out it was a man with a knife wearing a mask we caught on our security cameras, he went to our backyard, drank a beer from our eski, waved at my dog and tapped the glass doors while looking inside.

Thank God I did not answer that door or go downstairs because he woudl've seen me.

Also turns out he broke into many other homes that night all through our neighbourhood"

But the egg cracking, UwU anime trans communities dangerously romanticize the reality of being trans and it's super culty. It's so scary."

Daily practices and affirmations of self love honestly improved my anxiety, depression so much that I feel the happiest I ever have. my partner and so many people who are older than me struggle with it because we're never taught to love ourselves, and it effects them like crazy. It sounds cliche but self love is the most important thing."

AskReddit,f6hahuz,t3_dr82rj,1572841207.0,"Okay so this is big cringe, this legit kept me up last night.

Some back story I was on holiday with my family and religious cousins and aunt + my terrible ex who they all hated. We sat down to have dinner one night, one of the last night's of the holiday and it'd been a shit holiday where I had been constantly pulled away from my family because of my ex so I was in no one's good books, my cousins says to my mum ""thank you so much for this meal!"". I, in the most sarcastic dickhead sounding voice say ""well ThANK yOu gOD fOr ThiS mEAl"". Everyone glares at me and I just say ""sorry terrible joke"" I was 15 and in the worst place mentally so everyone now understands why I was such a dick that trip, but I was just the worst."
