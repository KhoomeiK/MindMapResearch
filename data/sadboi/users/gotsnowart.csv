PublicFreakout,fl60e2r,t1_fl5kvq5,1584850604.0,This is literally so accurate it's scary. The year Trump was elected there were at least three kids in every class dressed as Trump for Halloween. And we're talking a town of less than 1000 people. I posted a news article on Facebook just yesterday of Trump telling that reporter he was terrible when asked what he would say to the American people and my own brother commented that my views were horseshit and that I was an embarrassment to him because other people in the community sent him screenshots when I posted anything non-republican so I needed to keep my mouth shut.
PublicFreakout,fl600x9,t1_fl5jn4l,1584850305.0,"They were fat before Trump. I'm saying that ever since he was elected, in my community if you do not feel the same way, you are bullied if you try to speak up about issues like this. The only people who spoke up were doctors and considering my brother works with the kid's dad, I heard all about the ""liberal bullshit doctor"" that told them their kid was going to die. And there are no consequences because nobody else will speak up. It IS very much an issue in a small town like that. You could cure AIDS in that town and get ridiculed for helping gay people. I have legitimately been cut off from family for speaking up about similar issues in the town for fear it might hurt their reputation. I don't think you realize the lengths people will go to protect their egos in a small conservative town. I've dealt with their republican views my entire life and been able to get along just fine UNTIL Trump was elected. So, yeah, I do hate Trump but u hate that he fuels that kind of ignorance in people when a child's life is at stake. That child will now repeat the same cycle with his own kids if he ever has any."
PublicFreakout,fl4ol5q,t1_fl4k08w,1584817966.0,You're 100% right but they're a rich family in the community (farming) and in this town if you're rich and love Trump anything you do is welcomed with open arms.

It was borderline maddening to me because one of the families I knew personally, and their 12 year old son got up to over 325 pounds and was diagnosed with diabetes and severe high blood pressure because his parents fed him straight shit for food.

It wasn't until her school started pushing us for a second opinion that we sought out another doctor. He was pretty blown away she hadn't been diagnosed sooner. He also diagnosed her with ADD and anxiety so she gets bored easily, worries about everything and is incredibly high strung.

HumansBeingBros,fe5u3y7,t1_fe5szs0,1578874977.0,"My daughter is almost 11 and was just diagnosed in September. We had suspected it, as being in public and anywhere around people or loud noises sends her into a tailspin. She had been seeing a behavioral therapist since birth for being a preemie but the therapist insisted there was nothing wrong with her. We had to get a second opinion and got a diagnosis on the very first appointment. Now, we're getting her used to special classes and trying to introduce her to various forms of therapy such as cooking and art which she loves. She is very verbal, in fact, she speaks so well it catches people off guard sometimes. But her social cues and her ability to interact with people is severely inhibited. Surprisingly, the other children at her school have been great with respecting her boundaries and giving her space. It's the adults in my family that we are having the most problems with. They seem to think that autism isn't a real disability and don't want to change how pushy they are with her. Over Christmas, she locked herself in her room because of aunts, uncles and cousins trying to bully her into giving hugs or letting them into her room to play with her toys. These are things that we have had to lay down some ground rules with because they are her biggest triggers. Unfortunately, some of my family is probably going to have very limited access to her as they can't seem to understand that she doesn't always want to interact with them and when she doesn't, she isn't being a ""little snot"", she just wants to be in her safe space."

Edit: I do realize that it's a spectrum and people can function at a much higher level. It still is encouraging as autism generally does affect social behavior pretty drastically.

So thank you for assuming I saw a fit body and instantly thought shockingly good looking but that's not the case. My SO is 6', 250 pounds, not athletic and is the most shockingly beautiful person on the planet to me. I still mean exactly what I said in my original comment. I guess I should have specified that their natural facial features were what I was referring to."
ConvenientCop,f7g85j1,t1_f7fx1v7,1573697012.0,My mom bought one for the office she manages after her best friend had a heart attack at the campground on a Saturday night. A police officer met them on the median of the highway and restarted his heart with one he had in his car and saved his life. She bought one for the office the very next day.

TikTokCringe,f68717t,t1_f682gq3,1572726055.0,I do no nut November every year and have never failed yet. It helps that I'm a woman.
aww,f66mxl6,t3_dqla11,1572712333.0,This is the only way I'd ever spend $8 on a medium coffee that tastes like microwaved toilet water.

DadReflexes,f60v62l,t3_dq5h08,1572626754.0,"One time when I was in high school at a basketball game, this little shithead elementary kid kicked the release on the gym door causing it to swing shut violently. Only there was a tiny 1 year old girl standing facing the door and I had about a fraction of a second to react because her mother was several feet away. Somehow, by the grace of the dad reflex Gods, I was able to stick my arm out and the door slammed into my elbow which hurt like hell but that little girl came about an inch from getting punted halfway into her twenties if I hadn't. I'm not a dad but I am a mom and that moment told me I was probably cut out for having kids of my own."

PublicFreakout,f5zup5g,t1_f5z34ce,1572588895.0,"My daughter has Asperger's and has meltdowns exactly like this. I'm almost positive this girl has autism, if not the exact same thing as my daughter. Her mannerisms, body language and especially the way she flees the situation at the end are all things I'm very familiar with which makes this a pretty heartbreaking video to watch."
