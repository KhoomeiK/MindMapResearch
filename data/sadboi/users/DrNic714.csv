It is easy, but there's a big mainspring in there to retract the chord. You'll need to be careful not to let it loose when taking things apart or it'll fly out of there. Take the cover plate off slowly incase the sprags still have a bite on it. Also, once you wind in new parachord let it take all the chord in, give er a couple more winds, then pull the chord out again and tie it onto the handle. Those extra couple winds will give you a nice strong retraction, without a bit of chord flopping out like a limp - you know what."

Advice,fbwul62,t3_eep5h5,1577159849.0,"No professional will give you a diagnosis on a third party from a description and an audio file. That said, as a fellow Canadian I will at least tell you to hire a solicitor. If the Tennant has damaged the property and you can prove it, the sheriff's office can remove them and help them find the help they need. It's a convoluted and difficult process, but my wife and I had a schizophrenic drug dealing tennant a few years back, who was also a terrific nightmare. The court evicted her, and moved her to a group home where she had a warm place to sleep and professionals to observe/guide her. The damage she did to our property and our legal expenses came out of our pocket, but at least we didn't throw her out on the street, and we got her out of our life."
Dogtraining,fbwo9y8,t3_eetydd,1577155102.0,"Do not answer his agression with anger. If your theory about his past is correct that is probably what he's used to. Whenever he is aggressive just calmly confine him to his kennel. Like a child in time out. Your being calm is key. When he's had time to cool off welcome him out of the kennel with affection. If he's amenable that's good, if he still aggressive calmly let him soak in the kennel more. The trick is showing him you're not capable of the anger, rage, etc. emotions he thinks humans are made of, while also showing him you won't tolerate his bad emotions as well."
