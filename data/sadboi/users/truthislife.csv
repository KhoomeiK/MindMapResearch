myfavoritemurder,fqa1lk3,t1_fq8z09p,1589211169.0,I do like it - it doesn't split and it's marked to show how much to use. My main purpose for getting it was the reusable container - trying to cut down on single use plastic!

Anxiety,fe6h3vy,t3_enuvi1,1578890714.0,You’re killing it homie! Keep it up :) I’m proud of you!
TMJ,f5iwkbn,t3_do0f0l,1572218736.0,"It’s normal! It should go away with rest. If it goes on for a few weeks, that’s when you need to check in with your doctor."
Mid_Century,f3osarv,t1_f3nq7c8,1571026983.0,I’ve never seen another either! I got mine from a friend who found it at an antique mall.  No signature on there that I can find either.

myfavoritemurder,f05pjps,t1_f04r06s,1568415997.0,"I actually take that for insomnia issues! It’s a low dose, and i take it responsibly. But it helps me fall asleep and stay asleep. My anxiety keeps me awake! I haven’t noticed any difference with my grinding since I started taking it though."
myfavoritemurder,f02s87e,t1_ezyb66j,1568337091.0,"It’s literally the worst. So much neck and jaw pain. Maybe the splint will help though! I want some sort of paralytic for my jaw, just while I’m asleep. 😂😂"
myfavoritemurder,f02s0pj,t1_ezyewv6,1568336958.0,"My canines are flat too!! But I ground my way through my dentist made guard in about a year. I’ve been doing the heat and bite ever since, my dentist said it was cheaper than buying a new guard every year, haha...ugh."
myfavoritemurder,ezy86u9,t1_ezxu4a5,1568260759.0,I was wondering the same!! I want mine redone at some point as well. I grind my teeth like crazy and I wear a mouth guard at night....but my teeth will still be stubs.

Anxiety,et9r800,t3_caivrn,1562603587.0,"I feel like this a lot, especially in the mornings before I’ve gotten out of bed. Everything about the day just feels like more than I can handle. But once I’m up and moving, I start to feel better. 

Try to get just one thing on your to do list done today, or this week if that’s more realistic for you. 

You can do it!"
Anxiety,et9qri0,t1_et9jlxr,1562603292.0,"I’m starting the process of documenting my issues with HR today after working at my job for 4 years and struggling with missing work because of my anxiety and depression.  It’s really hard for me and I’m afraid of people knowing about it. :( but I’m looking forward to having it done, and knowing my job is more secure because of it."
