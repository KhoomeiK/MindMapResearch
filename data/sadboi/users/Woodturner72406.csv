I think a lot of people see themselves in such a way as you, until they gain a new perspective, whether it be spontaneous or assisted.  I endeavored to assist you in gaining such perspective and I am delighted that I was successful!  If fact, I have another such perspective to offer up.  When I thought back to the memory of your picture I found that my memory had painted you as a French Musketeer, with the fancy hat and all the vestments thereof.  I pictured you as a heroic, dashing, and brave Musketeer who hides his sadness behind a devil-may-care attitude and a disarming smile.

Sorry for the long response but as a life long reader I tend to wander into literary reveries.  I don't know if this helps but if ever you are feeling anxious, stressed, or even depressed, just imagine this Musketeer that I imagined is there with you, advising and encouraging you.  Hell, give him a name, perhaps Pierre?  You are never too old to have an imaginary friend, my friend.

May the Universe rain down blessings on you day and night, and may you be a blessing to those around you.
