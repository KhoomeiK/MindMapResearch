singapore,fpduyuf,t3_gcncvk,1588534761.0,"**tl;dr: If you are performing academically well, go to a JC. Your chances of social mobility will be higher.**

The Singapore system gives you a lot of options (e.g. streaming, subject combinations, JC/Poly). But you have to understand that these are very different routes and not alternatives to the same destination.

If you are the first generation in your family going to university, then doing just the academic bare minimum might seem like a reasonable and smart choice.

""Why compete with all the kids that are good at mugging when I can get real skills from a poly, be with my sec school frnds, take a more relaxed approach for the next 3 years, and still have a chance of going to uni? The pay for a poly grad is also not so bad."" That's what you're thinking am I right? Believe me, generations of us have gone through that exact thought process. Looking back, I think it's unfair to let 16/17 year olds decide something like that, especially those whose parents are working in blue-collar jobs.

But here's the fact, despite recent changes to make the whole affair less elitist, scholarships and university places (local and top overseas) still overwhelmingly go to JC students, with a slight bias towards the brand name schools. The harsh truth in the real world is that even if you meet the minimum requirements on paper it doesn't guarantee an offer for your application (e.g. uni, jobs, all that). You need to be above and beyond.

Anecdotally, a large majority of my secondary school classmates who went to JCs (even the neighbourhood tier ones) made it to the local 'big three': NUS/NTU/SMU, compared to a handful of those who went the poly route (and they have near 4.0 GPA). Those who went to JC aren't even the brightest bulb in class, they were just average students scoring mostly B's and a few A's for their A levels. Most of my poly friends ended up in SIM, SUTD, and Australian universities. Same thing for the JC kids who couldn't get a spot in the big three. Some decide not to go to uni at all. Then there are those went to JC, flunked their A levels, and went to poly. But, trust me, if you are willing to put in the time and effort, you can't flunk A levels."

In other countries like the US or Germany, people with post-grads get jobs which match their skillset. This too have to be built up, but I think the first step of actually wanting to start a PhD correlates with a student's perception of the chances of academic success, rather than the amount of money they will earn.

Or come out to show actual support for the repeal of 377a?  Because Singaporeans are still afraid to be associated with it.
