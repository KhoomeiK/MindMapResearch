ptsd,fqpq9k8,t3_gjxcmv,1589551937.0,"Thank you for saying this. Through looking at other people’s symptoms through this sub, I’ve started to realize a lot of the issues I have come from PTSD. My memory has been going downhill, I can’t physically sleep without melatonin, and I can’t talk about it to anyone. Not even my therapist. It’s already a lot for me to type this message and the more I go on about it, the more I’m shaking and the harder my heart pounds. I know that my PTSD, just like everyone else, is valid despite being belittled by plenty of people.

Although it’s scary to think of what might happen to me later on, it’s kind of comforting to know I’m not alone and other people are going through the same thing."

FridgeDetective,f8bxrq7,t3_e03dll,1574447778.0,"I’ve found out a few things. First of all, you’re definitely American, judging by the condiments and the labels. You’re either trying to eat healthier ooorrr you just like black bean burgers, which I respect. You cook a little, since you have a lot of ingredients in there, and you can’t help yourself around sweet stuff with the ice cream and whipped cream.

I’d say you’re a pretty young adult, either living alone or with a small number of people. You make a decent amount of money but still not a ton, so you buy some cheaper products. (Or you just want to save money and/or prefer those.) Milk is usually a good indicator to decide how many people are living in a household, and the smaller container indicates there being a small number of people, or you/some people don’t drink it. There’s a carton of almond milk in the corner, so that can be the case.

You like pickles.

That’s really all I have to say about this. I’m fairly inexperienced with this stuff."
