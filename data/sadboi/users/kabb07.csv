Although lashing out like you do isnt very healthy, in some cases it can be normal.  Seeking a therapist could help you with those things and mental and certain exersizes could help with emotions.  Meditation helps.  I havent done it in a while but when i did before it helped me feel like the weight that was on my shoulders disapprear. I would also suggest doing research on controling emotions and things as such to help if yoy dont have anyone or are not able to talk to anyone. Good luck my friend ‚ù§"

lgbt,exo1894,t3_ctv453,1566467766.0,"You didnt give it up for nothing.  Your mom kicked you out because of your sexuality.  And for one its not right, kind reminds me of how my mom would act towards me but not because of my sexuality though. I couldn't ever tell her that.  She shouldnt have been going through your stuff in the first place and went and asked you if anything was wrong.  Maybe try to talk things through with her because theres a lot of communication lacking in the situlation.  If she refuses and yoy have to go, try to sto stay with a relative/friend that you can trust for a couple days or so.  Maybe your mom needs to clear her head who knows, if not then hopefully you'll have somewhere to stay.  But i dont think its right shes taking those things away from you either. They were basically a gift.  If you put money into the phone/car (example: pay the bill or put gas into it) then you shouldnt have that took away.  If you dont then i still think its wrong anyway.  But anyway im sorry this is so long lol. I hope the best for you dear ‚ù§ ill keep you in my thoughts and prayers if it means anything ‚ù§‚úã"

mentalhealth,exa8zzc,t3_crwn0v,1566102231.0,Youe time will come when a women will really want to be with you.  I saw your subreddit to see if you you are ugly as you said you were (in which i didnt think you would be) and you are actually not ugly. As for wanting to kill people i think you should seek out to someone or get professional help.  Killing others or yourself will not solve your personal problems.
