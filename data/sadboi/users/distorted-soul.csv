psychologystudents,fnlnjlw,t1_fnliz0z,1587056554.0,"My English is pretty poor to articulate my thoughts accurately but yes, antipsychotic drugs are effective most of the time for psychotic symptoms but they act merely as a major tranquilizer/symptom suppressant. The dopamine hypothesis has no sufficient evidence, also the ""risk genes"" have very small effect (https://slate.com/technology/2016/02/schizophrenia-genes-found-not-so-fast.html).

I am convinced that schizophrenia is a psychogenic disorder originating in the pre-verbal period. Spotnitz's theory in a nutshell is that a baby gets frustrated early in life and instead of expressing his rage outwards, he directs his aggression towards his own ego because he feels omnipotent and is afraid that his rage will destroy his mother which is a valuable object. It has very damaging effects for the patient. This process is unconscious but reversible. The main goal of modern psychoanalyst is to develop a ""narcissistic transference"" and make it possible for patient to express his fury towards the analyst. It takes modified technique to achieve that where analyst mirrors and joins the patient.  You can read more about it on Wikipedia (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_psychoanalysis).

Unfortunately, therapy of schizophrenia is hard and takes a long time to see improvement. There are different psychoanalytic theories but most of them agree that schizophrenia originates very early in life and is caused by some sort of trauma.

I have severe negative symptoms (loss of motivation, pleasure and motivation etc.) + cognitive problems. These symptoms haven't improved yet but my suicidal thoughts are almost gone, anxiety has vanished and I haven't had psychotic breaks ever since. Maybe it's a coincidence, maybe not. Modern analysts write that schizophrenics start improving only when they start expressing their aggressive feelings towards the analyst.

Hope this is helpful for you!"

I only have one session per week through Skype and I started therapy in November. The first few months were hard because I had extreme anxiety before sessions, but that has improved to a point where I often wish that sessions were longer than 50 minutes. My suicidal thoughts are almost gone and I feel pretty hopeful. So called psychotics take long time before they improve as compared to neurotics. I'm pretty sure acute cases are also easier to treat because chronics like me have blunted emotions and cognitive problems."

I've tried lots of things (drugs, medications, illegal drugs, different diets, excercise, religion, yoga, nootropics etc.) to treat my catatonic schizophrenia with predominantly negative and cognitive symptoms and nothing worked. I am currently in psychoanalytical therapy (so called modern psychoanalysis for schizophrenia). My case is severe and rare so it will take a long time until I improve but I'm feeling hopeful and have less suicidal thoughts and anxiety. I am lucky because most mainstream therapists don't know schizophrenia is a psychologically reversible disorder.

Psychiatrists locked me in a psych ward (I was psychotic but not violent), forced me to take cocktails of antipsychotic drugs (which are neurotoxic), I suffered from severe akathisia and they refused to reduce the dosage. It was torturous and by far the worst months of my life. I also developed gynecomastia from risperidone. Unlike obesity from olanzapine, this ""side effect"" is permanent and I won't receive any compensation because I'm from 2nd world country and can't sue anyone responsible for this like many patients do in USA.

There are moments of calm numbness but then I start obsessing about what a failure I am and get anxiously depressed. 

I never watched movies or read books voluntarily, even as a child. Like there was early trauma or whatever and I never healed, or I was born like that. 

Can abuse and neglect lead to this? My mother was cold and insensitive when I was a child, instead of comforting me she used to act like I am a problem for her. I never felt loved, I was like a doll. She also took me to same bed as her when I was a child and father slept in a different room, alone. Could this be what Lacan explains as foreclosure of father or was it an internal process?

 I had recurring nightmares as a child where a witch comes and tries to kidnap me and if I manage to turn on the light switch while she brings me out of the room, father wakes up and saves me from that witch, sometimes it happened but sometimes not and I would wake up in panic.
