deadbydaylight,ffxa94q,t1_ffx7nxd,1580321002.0,"True. If you check Killers’ perks and get to know them all you’ll have better understanding of the game but it doesn’t necessarily mean that just because of this, devs are allowed to word badly things. They would lose nothing if for example they changed it to something like this : “Destroy 4 generators using The Doctor’s Overcharge”"
deadbydaylight,ffxa24h,t1_ffx90t1,1580320884.0,That’s exactly what I mean. They could simply word it the way you did. That’s perfect. People are weird nowadays as soon as you ask about something that hasn’t been much talked about before you’ll often get reprimanded. It’s sad.

deadbydaylight,ffx6j7h,t1_ffx5tp7,1580318795.0,Sorry but you explained something totally irrelevant to what I’ve talked about. You’ve talked whether that challenge is Killers’ or Survivors’ one.

Everyone is free to play the way he wants within the games’ rules limit, nothing should stop survivors from pallet looping nor using 4 flashlights. Same goes for killer, if he wants to camp to finish his target, he’s free to do that, meanwhile, other survivors should be repairing generators, or trying to rush all together to free that person instead of tilting and thinking about what they’ll say when shit talking after the game ends.
