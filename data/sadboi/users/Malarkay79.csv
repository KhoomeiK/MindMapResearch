Tuna or egg salad sandwich.

Spaghetti with jarred pasta sauce.  Cook and drain the spaghetti, put it back in the pot you cooked it in and dump the sauce in and stir it up.  The hot pasta will warm up the sauce and you only dirty one pot.

Oh, french toast is another good one, especially if you have bread you need to use up or has gone stale.  Beat some eggs and milk together.  A little glug of vanilla extract.  Coat both sides of the bread in the mixture, fry it up in butter.  Top with syrup or, even better, some more butter, cinnamon and sugar."

Even now in some churches, women canâ€™t be clergy.  In fundamentalist sects, woman shouldnâ€™t work, should be subservient to her father or husband, never refuse her husband sex, dress modestly, her ambition should be to be a mother and helpmeet.  Premarital sex is a sin...mostly for women.  Purity balls are a thing and are pretty creepy.  In culturally Christian society America, at least, rapes go underreported, under charged, under convicted, under sentenced because â€˜well what was she wearing/how much did she have to drink/did he really force her or is she just regretful of saying yes?â€™

As a result, time seems to have gone by really quickly when you look back on it.

So actually, being productive and switching up what you do each day makes you feel like time has gone by slower and it feels more fulfilling.

You might benefit from drawing up a rough schedule.  Set aside time where youâ€™re working on those projects you want to get done, but also build in time you can play WoW and take the occasional nap.
