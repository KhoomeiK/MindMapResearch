Three days without a cigarette so far, found out yesterday that a constant sore throat, only one side, for over a month with no other symptoms is cause for concern. When I lost my home with my family and had to start figuring things out on my own as fast as possible because with a baby on the way everything has a deadline. Everything has to be perfect for this new life because my life was everything but. 

When I was diagnosed with anxiety I thought it wasn’t that bad. But now it hinders my ability to live. I can’t sleep or eat. I smoked and I still want to. But I force myself to take care of myself because it’s not just me anymore. Now I would trade this emotional pain for any physical pain in the world. I would rather have chronic pain than experience this in my head. Everyday. Fear is the worst thing I have to fear because when it comes out of nowhere I get even more worried. I realized I grew older, when I realized I have that look in my eyes that says please take the pain away. Please.

I was tricked by a “friend” who told me k2 was weed. He called it teukie. It smelled like coffee in a gross way.

All I ever had was bad trips, extreme nausea, shaking, heart was racing, and my thoughts were so loud. If someone was talking to me they were loud in my head. I was over stimulating and freaking out. I couldn’t see right if I looked at one side of the room and then the other, my brain convinced me it was an entirely different location.

I couldn’t sense the passage of time. 5 minutes felt like hours. Hours felt like seconds. I couldn’t remember what happened 5 minutes ago. The past 5 minutes were always a blind spot but I could remember before that. Every so often I would suddenly realize what happened 10 minutes ago actually happened and I would freak out.

This is all horrible but I thought once I stopped smoking it it would go away. Problem solved. I found out what it really was and I dropped it and convinced my fiancé to drop it with me. Took him a few relapses but we’re good now he’s 7 months clean.

But no it’s not over. It’s never over. The first flashback I ever got, I felt the familiar location confusion and my balance went funny, like my ears thought I was in 0g. I recognized it immediately and I could only think in my head, *no. No. Not again. Please! Never again! I stopped I haven’t smoked in forever please let it be over and done!!*
