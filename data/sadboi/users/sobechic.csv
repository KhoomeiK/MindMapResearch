UWMadison,fr30ivm,t3_gm7nrd,1589847500.0,"I would take a Pass and when the Japanese internship interviewer asks why there is a ""Pass"" grade you prove that you where to receive a B by printing out the report (ASAP).You then explain that your grade would be higher, but that due to campus closing and strain that changes caused you to employ the Pass grade in place of a revealing the grade on your DAR report. It's seems like your on the right path. Good luck!"
UWMadison,fr213ei,t3_gi3e2x,1589829341.0,"Hello,

 

Thank you for contacting the Summer Term Office at UW-Madison. We have received your message and a member of our Summer Term staff will be in touch with you within 24-48 hours during business hours, although some answers require more time. If you are emailing regarding scholarship decisions, we've received an unprecedented number of applications, and in order to review all information we are delayed in releasing decisions. We will notify all scholarship applicants by Tuesday, May 19th. The 100% tuition refund deadline for the early May 18th session is May 22nd, decisions will be released before that time. We understand the impact this delay may have on you, and we appreciate your patience during these unique circumstances. All applications will receive a notification, regardless of offer status, if you have not heard it does not mean you won't be receiving an award. We will try to respond to scholarship inquires, but many are answered with this information. 


You can contact a live chat agent during work hours at summer.wisc.edu or check out our FAQ page here.


 

On Wisconsin!

Before every semester in math I would go to Rate My Professor to check on their characteristics, I would even meet them beforehand.
Also, I went to the tutoring Services at least 3-4 times a week.
It finally got done, and in that way, it's a real life success story"
