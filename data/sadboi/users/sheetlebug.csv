depression,f7w1a4v,t3_dxfekd,1574028906.0,It definitely feels like that when you’re still in it. You’re doing an awesome job though trying to fill that time. The more you do it the more your brain will be rewired and eventually it won’t be a chore or a way to fill time. Sitting around will be when you need it. Working out will be cause you love how it makes your brain and body feel. Hobbies will just be an enjoyable part of the day. Don’t stop what you’re doing! It feels so pointless and like it will never end but it will.

loseit,f3a4u7l,t3_devzhi,1570761743.0,I used to have the same problem. It doesn’t make you a 5 year old. I think most people have some form of impulse control. I made changes in my habits and would revert back and would try again and revert back. And over and over again. Sometimes I’m shocked that I eat so many vegetables now. At least once a day usually. I think if you’re trying and failing well you’re better than most honestly. American diets are so bad and that’s how we were raised. I think any attempt is worthwhile. Stick with it!

It’s the worst feeling like you’re buried in these feelings. Like most days are a struggle. Like there’s no point. It does get better. Keep fighting please. 🖤

depression,f0us0in,t3_d4w3pm,1568949025.0,People telling you your problems aren’t bad are just impatient and dealing with their own stuff. I’m sorry people made you feel that way. Your problems are very real and they are harming your mental health. I know I can see that from our talks. I believe you are between a rock and a hard place. Please keep recognizing what you need to change in that situation and working for it as I know you have been. You’ll get there!
depression,f0uruf9,t3_d5u6ew,1568948887.0,It’s a bandaid until it’s not anymore! Keep doing stuff and socializing and it will get better. I know it doesn’t feel that way. I still have a lot of nights even when I’m feeling great I’ll crave not being alone and almost call people to a fault just as a means to not be alone with my thoughts. Friends are a great coping skill. Socializing is a great coping skill. Keep laughing and having fun and feeding your brain some of those good chemicals even if it feels temporary. It won’t always. <3
SuicideWatch,ezae578,t3_d0eaw5,1567799779.0,"Recently I’ve been wondering what kind of progress I’ve made in the past few years. I think if you sit with yourself you may find you’ve made progress in ways you may overlook on the daily. I seesaw between old coping skills sometimes especially when I’m feeling restless about how much I want to accomplish and how far I feel from those things. But I rarely stop to think about how much better I am doing. It’s corny but progress not perfection is my motto this week. Something I’m trying to remember every day because I think negative self talk is so easy. Learning new habits and sticking with them is so hard. Dealing with stress and life and the reality of how your life is panning out vs other people’s is hard. You are a joy to know and a good friend. You have something in you that’s still trying to be happy and that is so big. Despite the shit that life hands you and the way people treat you, I see you striving to show up FOR YOURSELF. You have no idea how huge it is that you’re showing yourself your worth inspite or how others put you down. That means your brain somehow and somewhere knows that everything that was taught to you about your worth is wrong. Your brain knows you are worth more than some people may show you you are. Please remember that the way other people treat you is not a reflection of you as a person. You are not nothing. You are not unimportant. Your feelings are VALID and you have a right to be feeling upset and hurt. ITS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE WORTH MORE. Thinking of you. Thoughts and vibes."

depression,eumil0j,t3_cgoufo,1563916182.0,"Hope this helps. I have had times even recently where I began feeling the same way. Overwhelmed by everything. All of the mistakes I’ve made financially that hold me back from where my peers are at. All of the people who make my life harder. I felt terrible every day. I felt like a lot of life is unfair. To be true, it really is a lot of the time. I pull tarot cards when I’m feeling anxious and depressed because they provide information about the way that you think and provide alternative points of view that I think can really add clarity to a situation. The card I pulled the one day was the viii of swords which I’ll paste at the bottom of this. Essentially what spoke to me in the description of this card was that we have a tendency when things aren’t going right to victimize ourselves even further and block ourselves from getting out of it. What I took from that is, things really suck, but the longer I was telling myself I was a victim I was also keeping myself the victim in the sense that I was sitting and waiting for someone to acknowledge that I was one. It’s hard when we don’t have validation for the things that are occurring. It can bring us back to our childhoods in a way because we want someone to care and see us and validate our feelings. For some reason when I read the description from this card it showed me that while I have had shitty things happen to me, I was doing shitty things to myself by making myself the victim. Instead of feeling sorry for myself I decided to just accept the things that have happened and start working on ways to improve where I was at. Take that last part with a grain of salt because it’s not nearly always that easy. But the concept was comforting.

relationship_advice,eumaw2o,t3_cgsn9d,1563913370.0,I’m so sorry this must really hurt. The most I can say that I hope resonates with you is this.. when you have low self esteem it opens you up to be disrespected in these ways and overlook it. You know there is an issue here otherwise you wouldn’t be reaching out on reddit to get everyone opinions. I think the magnitude of responses on here can show you that you being hurt by this is very valid. Your feelings about this are valid. It took me a long time in life to realize that when you have feelings about these things and the person you are with doesn’t validate them it’s an early sign that the relationship is not a good fit. He may be the perfect man on paper but the perfect man respects you and wants your feelings considered. Him inviting his ex and not saying anything about it is a sign that in my opinion that he is not the right person for you. You are worthy of someone who wants to have you at a wedding. Someone who tells you about it right away and doesn’t try to bring their ex-girlfriend. If you guys stay together I think it will be hard to trust him and you’ll have now opened yourself up for more disrespect in the future. Everything he is doing is not a reflection of you or how he feels about you as a person and a reflection of himself and his character. I hope this finds you well.
depression,eui5mkg,t3_cg9irs,1563840885.0,Omg im so sorry! Hope you are feeling ok after the accident. That must be a terrible feeling having all of that happening all in one day! I know on a day like that it’s easy to think the worst of yourself. I once was feeling anxious about a social situation and was shaking while driving. Dropped my cigarette and hit the car in front of me that was waiting at a red light. I think you have a lot going on and accidents happen when we have a lot on our minds. You’re doing awesome making it to work and powering through. Please reach out if you want to talk.

relationship_advice,etigcjz,t3_cbqd4j,1562849222.0,I would suggest a sex therapist and if she’s not into that well life’s too short. Sexual drive compatibility is definitely a requirement when you’re in a lifelong commitment. If she’s not willing to try to discuss with you why she doesn’t like that stuff and isn’t trying to help find solutions I’d say there is no mutual respect and admiration in the relationship and you deserve better.
self,etf524l,t1_etekzzb,1562760332.0,There’s studies that show it can have a positive affect on your mental health. They used to use it for patients years ago and it’s becoming slowly introduced again!
SuicideWatch,et7cq2e,t1_et746t7,1562528981.0,"In regards to the therapists that’s awesome that you’ve tried switching therapists. I think that is shows a lot of determination to grow. For me, it took a while before I started making connections in therapy that made it feel worthwhile. A lot of times I think I felt the same as you described. I liked going but felt it wasn’t helping and it wasn’t really her fault. My anxiety is very vocal in terms of, ill talk a lot about things and not a lot about how I’m feeling. Where as others I think don’t want to talk a lot and don’t want to talk about their feelings either? Not sure if I’m making sense. Anyway, I felt a lot of times I just went to the appointments and rambled the entire time about really nothing. After a long time I started to realize different things about what I was really rambling about. The things from my childhood that related to the current experiences. It still takes me time to put an emotion to that as she would prompt me how it made me feel and I would always just say “annoyed”. 

As far as cleaning goes, it isn’t always easy, it kind of depends on how bad my anxiety/depression is. When it’s bad it takes a lot of effort. I may start to clean, make a bigger mess, cry, decide to take a bath or lay down. Then if I get up to eat, I’ll try to quickly clean some more. A lot of times if it’s bad I may go weeks doing a really shitty job of just generally “putting things where they belong”. I won’t deep clean I’ll just wipe things down if I have the energy. I’ve definitely had days it has felt like it was taking everything I had in me to do even the smallest thing and it upset me even more. Those days I just get what I can done and make it look “presentable” as possible. Take some motherfuckin b vitamins, chug water. I’m like this will make my brain healthy haha. It does start to help. It takes time tho in waves. 

Awesome on the books! I tend to immerse myself in the books because its like googling things but better for me than sitting stuck on my phone for hours. I’ve spent a lot of my time on psychology today. I’ve taken their emotional intelligence quiz for $11 to have them pinpoint areas for me. It just gives you something to do while also learning about what could be going on with you."

depression,eso7r2f,t1_esnjoqm,1562161721.0,"I read recently if you’re not failing at your goals then your goals are too small. Hopefully this resonates but, I am 30, went to college, have a job making good money. However, I wish I didn’t go to college. I see people who work entry level jobs, save money, and travel every few months and I wish I could do that. 

I have been trying to pay off student loans and limit my means in order to eventually be able to quit this job that pays more.

I spent so many years doing having these goals that I don’t even know if they were mine at all. Just something that my parents pushed and society. At this point I realize I’m not where everyone else is at 30, married, house, kids. I guess what I am saying in, society conditions us to feel ashamed that we aren’t doing what everyone else is doing. I think if we follow that straight and narrow we would be more miserable as a result."
depression,eso717c,t3_c8k5xr,1562161239.0,"Spent this week trying to get organized since I think certain things make me feel worse. Like having my money figured out for the next few months. I definitely think tracking any positive habits you’re trying to work on helps me. Calendars with fun stickers from the dollar store has always been a nice reminder for me I hang in my bedroom. I tend to think “oh I’m not doing enough” but if you look at the calendar the results are there. 

Finding your self care things. Whatever relaxes you. You may not feel 100% at first but you’ll start to eventually. I used to take baths for hours with a candle and some music. Now I don’t need that long all the time. 

I really like cleaning and organizing my stuff. Getting rid of excess stuff I don’t need so I don’t feel smothered by everything. And I have found sage to be relaxing when I have the energy to burn it and walk it around my space.

Hope this finds you well."

The people at planned parenthood and there to guide you and make sure they ask you the right questions to gauge your mental health.

Maybe explain you don’t want to get into the past stuff yet because of your history of having to tell it to so many therapists before. That way you can get into it when it’s organic and relevant to a current feeling.

It’s like continuing to start writing a book about yourself and then losing it over and over again. That beginning period is important and if you have to repeat it a bunch it becomes exhausting. Even when I go to see my therapist again now that I’ve stopped completely I have to recap her on everything. It’s definitely not as easy as it was the before when she and I were meeting consistently.

I wonder if you can make pleas to your insurance for therapists that aren’t covered. I know I’ve made pleas to get birth control covered for free that wasn’t because the brand they covered made me depressed."

Finding out what my self care was. It may take some time to push through the bad feelings to get into a schedule but I honestly believe it’s worth it.

For me, cleaning up everything in my living area. Organizing my stuff. Eating healthy or trying. Working out. 

These things took time to keep doing but after about 2 months I really noticed a steady decrease in overactive negative thoughts. 

Trying to get started I would cry in between doing productive things. I tried not to commit to doing too much with other people on these days but still contacted people through text. 

I started off just going for walks. Some headphones. Good music. The more I had the thoughts I would say another lap. Some days you can outlaw your bad thoughts. 

Get good sleep. Try to eat some vegetables even if they are at a Chinese buffet. I give myself credit for everything.

I keep a calendar for tracking a workout it shows me what I’ve accomplished. The dollar store has the best stickers too. Hello kitty. Rainbows. 

The books I’ve really enjoyed are: “Attached” and “Running on empty, overcoming childhood neglect”.

They really were easy reads and I honestly believe they apply to everyone. 

I really hope things improve for you! Rooting for you.

Also BATHS.

In really dark times I’ve spent hours in the bath.

As I’m in full panic mode this human trafficking looking mother fucker in his mid forties came up to me as another older man appeared behind him. He looked me dead in the eyes while pointing at me as he said, “I’m a drug dealer, you look like a drug dealer”. I froze and then quickly handed him a meme card and ran.
