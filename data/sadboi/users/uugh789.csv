bipolar,f5ia7s1,t3_dnv19e,1572212469.0,"This probably isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre hoping to hear, but in my experience, it‚Äôs much more difficult to get accommodations in graduate school than undergrad. Also graduate school can be especially tough to undertake unless you‚Äôre in a good place, mentally. I know this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúright‚Äù but in my experience it‚Äôs just the way it is. I think it stems from the dynamic that so much of your success in graduate school is dependent upon your ability to forge strong working relationships with your professors. Unfortunately many of these professors are old (school) and perceive requests for special accommodation as weakness. This is probably highly discipline and university dependent but it was unfortunately true for both graduate programs I attended. I think the best strategy for success is to seek out the professors that seem the most sympathetic and, if needed, request their support informally as your needs arise. 

Just my experience. Hopefully things are changing."

bipolar,f5hy0w4,t3_dnspb2,1572208980.0,"I feel you. I was in your shoes many years ago.... feeling lost, alone and unloveable after multiple failed relationships. It‚Äôs a tough row. I eventually met my soul mate and he is everything. Almost daily I wonder why he‚Äôs willing to be with someone ‚Äúlike me‚Äù but I‚Äôve learned to trust him when he tells me he loves me as I am, even when I don‚Äôt feel worthy of his love. 

I have two thoughts/comments to share. First, I think the best thing you can do for yourself and your future is to use this time to work on you. Find the right meds, get in therapy to work out the issues you‚Äôre carrying around, practice self-care. Set up healthy routines and habits. While you‚Äôre waiting for your soulmate work on cultivating the best version of yourself, not for your soulmate, but for yourself.

The second thing I‚Äôd say is that finding that soulmate, as amazing as it is to have someone by your side, won‚Äôt fix your mental health struggles. I thought that when I met my husband my mental health would magically improve and this was not the case. I am so grateful to have a partner in this, but I‚Äôm still bipolar, and I still fight everyday for my sanity. It‚Äôs important to keep this perspective and to not oversell the influence your partner will have on your health.
