Unfortunately, I am VERY sensitive to akathesia, so this combo allows me to take the least amount of medications for akathesia compared to other APs. 
Needless to say, I sleep well at night. 
With Geodon and Risperidone, I would have akathesia in my sleep (dream about it and my husband says I would thrash about in my sleep until I woke up to terrible akathesia) even w all the propranolol, Valium, and Cogentin. I’d have to take Benadryl too sometimes."

I was able to come off the antipsychotic for my SZA and thus was able to 86 the cogentin, Valium, and giafecine (sp?). 

Anyway, I am so glad it helped you! I’ve been on it, same dose for maybe 6 months or longer now. Like you, I take it with NAC. On their own, neither NAC nor sarcosine is effective enough to keep me stable enough to be off antipsychotics. However, together, they work AMAZINGLY well.

Idk about the ketamine association though bc I had ketamine IV tx’s and was super sensitive to the medication. Maybe the SZA makes me super sensitive to it anyway, so if the sarcosine amd Lamotrigine tines it down a bit, it’s still no big deal. I felt like I was astral projecting at my last treatment w ketamine. Idk if that is the k hole or not, but that’s what happened.

I recently added Amyloban 3399 to see if it would potentiate the effect of the sarcosine and NAC. Shall report back in a few months.

Best of luck to you!! Sarcosine and NAC have been a game changer for me!!"
