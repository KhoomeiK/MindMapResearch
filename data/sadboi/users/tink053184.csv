Anyway, I am so glad it helped you! I‚Äôve been on it, same dose for maybe 6 months or longer now. Like you, I take it with NAC. On their own, neither NAC nor sarcosine is effective enough to keep me stable enough to be off antipsychotics. However, together, they work AMAZINGLY well.

Idk about the ketamine association though bc I had ketamine IV tx‚Äôs and was super sensitive to the medication. Maybe the SZA makes me super sensitive to it anyway, so if the sarcosine amd Lamotrigine tines it down a bit, it‚Äôs still no big deal. I felt like I was astral projecting at my last treatment w ketamine. Idk if that is the k hole or not, but that‚Äôs what happened.

I recently added Amyloban 3399 to see if it would potentiate the effect of the sarcosine and NAC. Shall report back in a few months.
