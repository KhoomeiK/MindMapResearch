AskEngineers,fpxgrj9,t3_gg1twn,1588982358.0,"Dunno how it for EE but for mechanical and aero first year of university will be very math heavy, lots of theory, lots of equations etc. 
You will have modules focused purely on math and you will have modules which are heavy in math but related to engineering like thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, structure/mechanics etc. 2nd and 3rd year go easier in the math area

In industry you will never come close to the amount of math you did at university so university is the hard part ( talking about mechanical and aero but I'm assuming its similar for electrical)

Its generally accepted that university is more difficult that the actual work you'll be doing in industry so if you can get through university you will be fine.

What's important and what many engineers lack is having a good ability to communicate via face to face, phone, writing and working with other humans. It's also important to work on your own I initiative, in industry you cannot just wait to be told what to do everytime like you would be during university 

Its much better to be a well rounded person than be super technical so I'd say youd make a great engineer

Also it doent matter if you're a girl. One of my structure professors designed the canopy for the F22 and she was female. And a postdoctoral who helped me immensely and is the reason I passed my MSc thesis was also female."

It's such a bizarre feeling because I wake up and I remember feeling happy, excited, scared, even being in love in my dreams. So knowing what that feels like and not being able to experience it in real life is that much more depressing."
buildapc,fpuczzf,t1_fpuc1ag,1588909908.0,"Thanks,

I was doing some independent research after posting my thread and I arrived at a similar conclusion.
Looking at Amazon, it looks like I can get 
MSI B450 TOMAHAWK MAX, Ryzen 5 3600X and 
Corsair(2 x 8 GB) DDR4 3200 mhz for £370


In terms of cases, does this look like a good one https://www.overclockers.co.uk/lian-li-lancool-ii-argb-midi-tower-case-black-ca-77t-ll.html 
?

Above case would bring the total to £450 which I would be happy with for getting 4 different parts.

EDIT: I was actually surprised at how cheap the Ryzen 5 3600X is (£180), are you sure it'll do the job?"

That doesn't sound good, you need to take a look at your CV and from reading it there are improvements you can make. First of, it's too technical, it's not memorable and it's boring

In terms of formatting it's not the best it could look. I would have dates on the left. Put skills after work experience

Some people have said it's got to be one page. Maybe it's different here in the UK but 2 pages is standard.

In terms of listing your modules, I would tailor this to the specific role. List the technical modules which are relevant to the role. 

You've included a lot of technical stuff, but you are missing examples of team work, team management, communication, presentation, leadership, chairing meetings etc. How does that thing that you did make you good for the role you are applying. Highlight transferable skills in the work you did at University but also IN YOU WORK EXPERIENCE 

Say how you did some thing successful and how it required attention to detail or how you did some other thing and how it required time management.

I will PM you my CV to take a look at."

AskEngineers,fog9rqt,t3_g53n5v,1587749801.0,"So from my experience( I been working for 2 months now), its important to recognize university is different from work. You won't get or be explained everything to you straight off the bat like you would when you're handed a new assignment at university. The people you work with have their own jobs to do, they have have been doing their job for a while and it might not occur to them that they might have forgotten or needed to explain some basic stuff. So its important to ask questions and dont pretend you understand what they're saying cause you're scared to look stupid, ask them to clarify things or explain things.

It's never a simple transaction. It's not like you're given a task, you compete a task and its job done. There is a lot of back and forth, and this is true at all levels of your career.
