joker,fqwgr2w,t3_gl0esy,1589703833.0,"So...Just watched this. I don’t really know what to think. Phoenix did an incredible job and deserved the Academy Award. I’m not a DC or superhero / comic movie watcher at all (have only seen the movies Ledger
was in, huge talent, may he R.I.P.). Idk though. This movie was just...sad and disturbing. It was like Falling Down (which I am generalizing when I say that cos I haven’t seen the film in years and am sure I’m forgetting a lot), but with a more surreal, stylized take on someone getting beat up by life and finally losing it. I guess from what I have read, that is somewhat the point, that it stands alone from your typical comics-based films. Not a bad movie, but definitely not what I was expecting as Joker’s origin story and i can’t say i enjoyed it either haha. The Joker here was deranged for sure, but not painted as villain really. Just a mentally ill and tortured soul who snapped. I wouldn’t say it was a bad movie or a good movie, just again, a sad (though not necessarily far-fetched) take on society, humanity,etc. Minus the clown makeup, it could have been a stand-alone (from the DC world) film on mental illness and the ravages of our shitty society"

For me, I’ve found the Nioxin 3 Part system (shampoo, conditioner, and scalp treatment) plus their 3D Hair Booster (which you apply like a spot treatment to your most troubled areas) has worked really well. I still do apply a castor oil mask to my scalp and hair on occasion for conditioning purposes, but I use the Nioxin system religiously. It took about 4 mos for me to notice a difference.

I agree it all seemed very rushed and not well fleshed out though. To me, the writing in the last season betrayed all the character development and relationship depth they had built throughout the series. Suddenly Christian was painted as truly the “bad guy” and the cause of all St. Sean’s problems, and Christian finally chooses to be selfless and let Sean go so he could go off and do what he wanted with his life. Sean was sanctimonious and didn’t take responsibility for his life or his fuck ups. It was a big let down that the finale sort of simplified the relationship down to a bad guy and a good guy because they were both complex, flawed, ridiculously codependent characters who truly cared for each other.

marinebiology,fo9w8j9,t3_g6hsih,1587633143.0,"I just had another thought - government marine resource organizations (both federal, like NOAA, and local, like your state’s dept of environmental protection) sometimes have volunteer monitoring opportunities. For example, in NY I know they used to have a citizen science program where you could report where and how many you see of certain species of fishes of interest during spawning season, so you could check for something like that too :-)"
marinebiology,fo9vpot,t3_g6hsih,1587632760.0,"Hi there! I’m not sure where you’re located, but best bet would be to google for NPO marine organizations near you. Most thrive on volunteer help and will have a volunteer application and contact info. From personal experience, such places usually need hands on help, but if you have experience with mapping data like ArcGIS, they may have data for you to map and analyze for them. Another great way you could partake without having any specific software or data skills and while still respecting the social distancing requirements could be beach clean ups (that is, if any beaches near you are currently open - a lot by me have been officially closed to the public due to Covid-19 and too many people congregating). If there are any beaches by you where you are allowed to go, however, a lot of organizations like to collect beach clean up data. So basically you just go for a walk on the beach with a garbage bag and gloves, and note down your location, time of day, tide level, temp, weather conditions and wind direction if you can find that info. Then just record the number of type of all the debris you collect (e.g. 12 plastic water bottles, 6 lengths of fishing line etc). You can also buy a luggage scale (https://www.amazon.com/Luggage-Scales/b?ie=UTF8&node=2477391011) and at the end of your cleanup, record the total weight of all of the trash you collected by weighing the bag. Then you can just email the organization with your data. A place I used to work with had a printable data sheet for volunteers to use to record all the info I mentioned, but you could easily make up your own or just use your phone to make a note of all the relevant info. 

If you can find an organization that assists in your state  with marine mammal strandings, once the quarantine is lifted, I’d say just volunteer as much as you can with them for whatever they need. Once they feel you’re dedicated to the organization, they would prob train you on strandings and necropsy work for both marine mammals and sea turtles, if that’s something you’d be interested in. 


Thanks for your interest in marine conservation and I hope you’re able to find an opportunity to get involved with!"

trichotillomania,fo260kf,t3_g501bs,1587450839.0,"Hi there! Congrats on your month pull free!! 😄🙌It sounds like you’re taking great care of your hair and scalp already. You mentioned Nioxin - I use that religiously (and one of those wet brushes, actually haha) and it’s made an incredible difference in my hair. I know they have many different products out, so just to give you a run through of what’s worked for me: I use the 3 piece system of shampoo, scalp therapy conditioner, and scalp & hair treatment (either a serum or foam depending on which number system you use). What was a real game changer for me was adding their 3D Intensive Hair Booster. It is a serum that comes in a pump and you only need to apply it to the scalp and hair where you have real trouble areas (e.g. the sparse spots). You can apply it to dry scalp or a damp scalp after your shower on days you wash your hair. It says apply twice a day (it absorbs quickly and you only need a little, so it shouldn’t leave your hair crunchy or sticky).  You apply the hair booster BEFORE the scalp & hair treatment that is part of the traditional 3 part system.  

Just a note: the root booster will make your scalp a little red and if you accidentally drip it on your face or your neck, it will likely leave a little red mark or welt even. It will go away within 30 min or so and is nothing to worry about - it’s due to the niacin and menthol in the product. It made me nervous the first time I used it, so I figured I’d mention it so you wouldn’t have to get concerned unnecessarily. 

Also, there is another wet brush type thing called tangle teezer that has very short and bendy rubber teeth. I got the one for fine or damaged hair and have found it’s great for giving little scalp massages or helping to massage in the serums too https://www.ulta.com/fine-fragile-detangler?productId=pimprod2005821

Good luck!!💗"
trichotillomania,fo257lg,t3_g58syc,1587450099.0,"Well, look at it this way, you’re in good company - there’s something wrong with all of us😜🤣Been pulling my lashes since I was 5 on and off (mostly on). Just some ideas for throngs to look into: In the past, hypnosis therapy worked for me for about 6 mos (then seemed to wear off). Also I’ve found that when I attend to my lash growth and can actually see real progress, it helps me quell the urge. I recently was using an inexpensive lash serum (Maybelline Lash serum, available at most drug stores) and it really sped up regrowth for me. The idea of actually being able to wear mascara for the first time in over 6 years, or better yet, leave the house without eye makeup on and not feel like I looked bizarre were big motivators for me, and seeing quick regrowth made those ideas seem tangible for the first time in a long time. It isn’t a magic bullet (I’d regrown lovely lashes using the serum religiously since Jan, felt pride being able to buy mascara again, etc, and then a couple of nights ago I massacred my lashes, so now they are super patchy and I am nearly back to square one), but maybe you could try a self care routine geared towards your lashes and see if that helps at all. Some people on here also have mentioned a supplement called NAC (I’ve never personally tried it), and one member said they wore white cotton gloves whenever they were alone and when they went to bed to help prevent absentminded pulling. It’s great you’ve managed to curb the eyebrow pulling, though, I attack those as well haha. Anyway, I hope some of these suggestions might help & good luck with your lashes!"

Ironically, now that bald spot is finally filling in...unfortunately, I have given myself several additional bald spots as of tonight as well.

NipTuck,fnpm7cd,t3_g2ttch,1587147956.0,This is great! 😁Thank you for sharing💕🙏
NipTuck,fnnc3cc,t3_g2jrjz,1587088990.0,Yup. She was a whole other level of terrifying. The image of the black eye buttons stuck to the guy’s eyelids has haunted me since I was watching the show when it originally aired lol. So fucking creepy.

NipTuck,fmvbwyn,t1_fmrk1by,1586411841.0,"It’s a fun little thriller. Not amazing or anything, but I find it entertaining and if I happen upon it flipping through the channels, I’ll usually leave it on for another viewing. I still need to watch Profiler! Once libraries open again, I’m going to check to see if my local library has any seasons available on dvd"
NipTuck,fmvbgwm,t1_fmrebse,1586411453.0,Thank you so much!😄
TheSinner,fmk89ok,t3_fujbxv,1586147130.0,Agreed. It was a bore & a waste of time. Total dumpster fire except for the acting
NipTuck,fmk1tny,t3_fvqd9t,1586142521.0,"That really annoyed me too! It felt like since it was the last season (which was a mess IMO overall), both the casting team and the writers just said ‘fuck it!’ Teddy from one season to the next seemed unrecognizable, and not just in appearance."

thegooddoctor,fm04rin,t1_fm00y0w,1585644667.0,"I preferred Melendez with Lim and wasn’t a fan of him and Claire as an item tbh, however I 100% agree it is ridiculous that PC bs influenced the writers’ decisions regarding Melendez being with either of these women. All three parties are adults and each coupling shared strong and sincere bonds. I thought it was lame Lim & Melendez broke up because of her promotion, and I think it’s equally lame for the writers to decide our ridiculously over-sensitive, PC culture is a reason to avoid a relationship between Clair & Melendez. Ugh."

Sounds like Park will be back for season 4"
thegooddoctor,flzv4z4,t3_fs77dk,1585634547.0,"Haha yes, you’re not alone, I really didn’t want to believe they’d write Melendez out either. Based on this interview with creator David Shore, though, it sounds like Melendez is indeed dead, sadly, but that Park will still be around for season 4. I wasn’t wild about this season all the way around, and with Melendez gone now, I don’t know if I’ll keep watching or not. Then again, I was really sad when Jared left after season 1, and they managed to keep things a float after that so, maybe it won’t become unwatchable.

NipTuck,flwkoz1,t3_fr0vka,1585554285.0,Memes are always fun and fan art is a great way for artists to show off their talent. Ray Donovan subreddit has had some great fan art - would love to see what the Nip/Tuck fans have created. Thanks so much for making this subreddit so we can all share in enjoying the show now that it is newly streaming again!
NipTuck,fllqxrp,t3_fpl1hy,1585265949.0,"Same reason he and Kimber kept finding their way back to one another, she says as much in season 6...she hates herself, and he hates her the best. And she tells him how he doesn’t even like much about her (he thinks she’s a whore and stupid etc) but he hates himself and doesn’t think he deserves anything more. I do think they both had love for one another, but in a toxic way, they both understood the deep self-loathing and sadness each was trapped in"
NipTuck,fllqlbz,t3_fpl1hy,1585265748.0,"Christian hates himself. He doesn’t know how to be with someone like Natasha who was always building him up and saying how she “saw” the good in him. He cannot see the good in himself, so he cannot stomach being with someone who sees him in a good light like that. It makes him hate himself even more and makes him act out like more of a dick to her because he doesn’t think he deserves it (her kindness & love)"
NipTuck,flg3kb2,t1_fle5dkz,1585129103.0,I know! I felt so awful for poor Adrian
NipTuck,flg3jeg,t3_fo26of,1585129071.0,"As the series progressed though, they didn’t harp on Ava being trans, just hated her for being a predator and bad influence on Matt. & They did have a lot of moments of compassion regarding the issue too, I noticed. Like how Sean helped Sophia transition and how Julia was supportive of her when the other ladies in the Pilates class tried to shun her. And also in season 6, when Christian helped a trans-woman transition back. So it wasn’t all bad or un-PC if you look at the show as a whole. From my understanding, Ryan Murphy is a big supporter of the LGBTQ community overall (I’ve only ever watched Nip/Tuck & some AHS though)"
NipTuck,flg315z,t1_flg12bc,1585128438.0,"Hahaha yes, exactly! And yeah, I just finished a rewatch  of the show, and I agree it’s pretty wild to see the way that storyline was portrayed at the time versus how the same subject matter would be handled in the modern day. Crazy to think how very different it was regarding what was considered “acceptable”. I saw this mentioned in another post too somewhere, but I’ve noticed similar in shows like Law & Order SVU where it’s easy to catch the old episodes. Really interesting commentary on the evolution of things regarding LGBTQ matters."
NipTuck,flg1uck,t3_fmxkla,1585126984.0,"I don’t agree about Sean being just a good, forgiving guy. I was never fond of Sean, he was sanctimonious, and always made himself out to be the nice guy victim, which he was not imo. But that difference of opinion aside, I think all parties involved were trying to make the best of a tough situation. Matt was old enough to understand the lie and the impact it had not only on him, but on his dad Sean and Christian...and he had already seen Christian of a sort of father-like figure (albeit the “cool dad” type). It made me think of the old saying, ‘if mom says no, ask grandma’ sort of thing haha. Christian already played that sort of role in Matt’s life. Christian always considered the Macnamara family his own, because he never really had a family to belong to the way he grew up. And they always treated him as family too. So I think it was everyone just trying to be realistic about the situation. Sean was always Matt’s dad. That never changed once the secret was revealed. But the co-parenting thing was almost natural even before they all knew the truth because Christian was such a big part of their lives. Think how Christian must have felt finding out he had a son of his own, someone he already loved like his own family. We saw how important that was to him with the whole Wilber thing. Him and Sean maybe didn’t always agree on how to treat Matt, but they were always (toxically) co-dependent, so it seemed only natural to me they would deal with Matt (who was nothing but grief for everyone lol) together, even when they butted heads on the best parenting methods to deal with his many troubles. It’s not like Matt started regularly calling Christian ‘dad’ instead of ‘Christian’. And of course, it is tv so yeah, I do agree the recovery from that bomb being dropped resolved way faster than it would have in a real life scenario. I thought the emotion was superb when it all came out though. When Sean scuffled with Christian and said “I loved you the most” ugh💔, such a well done scene."
NipTuck,flfxl2t,t3_fo26of,1585121814.0,"Hahaha, I honestly laughed so hard at that moment because they made it soooo melodramatic the way Christian delivered the news. Never sat right with me the fact she was a sexual predator and molested her own adopted son, but that was sort of shrugged off. She should have been reported to the police and jailed for being a pedo"
trichotillomania,flc1bx2,t3_fnnodd,1585017478.0,"Hello! Our stories are quite similar! I started pulling at about 5 years old too, and remember it began a day or so after an eyelash had naturally fallen out and my grandma told me that when an eyelash falls out, you get to make a wish! I’m 35 now, and I have pulling on and off (mostly on) since then, at first it was just eyelashes, but at some point I started doing it to my eyebrows too. Hypnosis therapy worked for me for several months back when I was in college, but eventually it wore off and I started pulling again. I have not sought any other treatment since then. Currently I have managed to regrow my lashes with minimal pulling over the last 3 months by using Maybelline Lash Serum. It helped them to grow in faster, and seeing progress gave me motivation to not pull and hope I’d be able to leave the house again without eyeliner on, and even wear mascara again if I wanted! My eyebrows are barely there right now, but for those I use a product called RapidBrow in a blue tube (they have a lash serum too, but it contains an ingredient which can darken the color of light eyes, so I don’t use it). Although I haven’t managed to leave my brows alone for more than a month at a time, the RapidBrow at least helps keep them growing back. I hope one day I can leave them and my eyelashes alone. Good luck to you!!💛💛"
trichotillomania,flbpjjg,t1_flajkn0,1585009683.0,"I’m really self conscious too, so I totally understand. And I’ve been pulling on and off since I was 5, so I had my share of kids teasing me before I was old enough for make up. Hell, I had a few friends I’d confided in when I was older say some insensitive stuff too, LoL. I think for anyone who doesn’t deal with trich, they just can’t grasp the emotional toll. It’s SO frustrating when you have some progress and then relapse...I’m feeling that now. Gotta just try to look at the positive, that it is possible to make progress and if you did it once, you’ll get there again. It’s a one day at a time struggle. I really hope the serum works for you! Castor oil is supposed to be great too, it’s just a little messy and slower to get results, I’ve found. But you’re eyeliner skills are really great and natural looking judging by your photo, so I hope you can feel a little more at ease and confident that you’re looking great even without the lashes right now 😊"
trichotillomania,fl9k5hc,t1_fl8r4g5,1584959364.0,"Omg maybe I need to get gloves! Thanks for the suggestion 😆. Almost 3 months pull free, & I’ve so enjoyed the freedom of not having to put eyeliner on everyday! But tonight I couldn’t sleep and pulled out a small patch :-( Time to get back out the eyeliner to fill the hole until it grows back lol"
trichotillomania,fl9jzya,t3_fnbscd,1584959177.0,"It looks great! I wouldn’t look at this photo and think about missing eyelashes. Eyeliner has been my best friend for a long time now. People really don’t seem to pick up on the lack of lashes when you have the eyeliner on...we are way more self conscious than people are observant! Lol. I have lashes again right now (though I just pulled out a chunk after several months pull free ...ugh) and I used Maybelline lash serum at the recommendation of someone on this sub. It made my lashes grow in faster, so I was able to control myself a little better because I had some hope being able to see real growth progress. Just wanted to suggest it in case you wanted to give it a whirl too. Regardless, your eyes are beautiful 💜"
trichotillomania,fl9jin9,t3_fngeox,1584958577.0,"I’ve been pulling since I was 5. When I was younger it was on and off. Once I hit middle school age though I’d say I rarely had more than a few sparse eyelashes. Once in late college I was able to stop pulling for several months. I could wear mascara again. It was great. Ten years later (after pulling again over that whole time) I again had about 6 mos pull free, and once again they all grew back. Right now I have a full set of lashes for the first time in 5 or 6 years (Well...I did have a full set. I just pulled a small patch out and am hating myself for it. But you know how it goes). I don’t think they’re as full as they were when I was a kid, but they are still pretty full and long. A good friend of mine was joking with me about me how she’s never touched her eyelashes, and yet even with how badly I’ve abused them, mine were longer and had more volume than hers. 

Anyway, I’ve been applying Maybelline’s Lash Serum religiously once in the AM and once before bed since late December, as per a recommendation from someone in this sub. I found it made the lashes grow in more quickly than using nothing at all or using castor oil, and since I was able to see real progress due to the quickened growth rate, I was able to control my urge to pull for the hope of being able to have normal looking eyelashes & wear mascara again. I would definitely recommend you give it a try. It’s fairly inexpensive and has no prostaglandins in it which could adversely effect skin and iris color. 

I just ran the applicator over my lash line like you would an eyeliner when my lashes were basically bald, and now that I have lashes, I apply it like a mascara, but making sure I get way down on the root area. I bet yours will grow back in just fine. Usually mine had the wiggly black roots you mentioned. I do believe you are correct in thinking that is because those were immature hairs (so it wasn’t blood). Good luck!!💜"
NipTuck,fl9amqw,t3_fmxjlm,1584947215.0,"Yeah it down hill after season 3, and became even worse once they moved it to LA for seasons 5 & 6. Season 6 in particular seemed to disregard all character development and complexity, which was so disappointing, and the actual finale seemed so rushed. I just finished my full series rewatch and honestly, I’d probably never watch past season 3 again, because it lost most of what made it special slowly after that, and in the last two seasons especially."
