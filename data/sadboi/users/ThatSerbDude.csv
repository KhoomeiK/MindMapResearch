I’ve opened up to some people that have made me feel like I was being melodramatic whenever I started talking about my emotions, but generally that’s just a paranoid trick your brain plays on you sometimes to make you bottle-up your emotions. It’s a knee jerk response that I’ve seen a ton of people do, but mostly guys due to there being a strong social stigma surrounding men opening up about mental health issues and emotional turmoil. You’re fine brother, just keep doing what you’re doing."
