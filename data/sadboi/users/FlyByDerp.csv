Plug the keyboard into your actual PC, straight up.

Press and hold the Windows Lock Key and F1 at same time until the lights go off, then you will see a flashing LED right next to the caps lock.  (This was posted on forums)

Also double NATing would be completely removed as well. The passthrough mode sucks tbh, it will still double nat and you'll still be limited to the tiny NAT table. 

Also yes, if power is lost you'd have to re-do the authentication manually and this is where the WPA route would be better. 


You could always go the WPA supplectiant route which you don't even need the Rg for and the ONT line would go straight into router.  But you'd need to get some certs from a NVG598/599 or bgw210 the later which would require soldering from what I've read.

modernwarfare,fcz3utd,t1_fcz3kyd,1578093121.0,"You literally can not.

All it does is emulate a controller. Y'all are spewing bullshit on stuff you know nothing about.

For macros you'd have to purchase a cronusmax or hardware that has onboard memory with macro support. Injecting cheats? Lmao, nah.  You can't wall hack, aimbot etc on ps4 or Xbox one like you can PC.

Macros and hacks are not the same. At least a macro user with rapid fire or jitter mod would still have to manually aim at me and even then they wouldn't be able to see me through walls nor lock on my head. 

Jtagging is 360 tech. Jailbroke PS4s can't go online. 


XIM also explicitly doesn't allow macros nor offer any kind of support for them. You can use macros but not officially.  If you had a modded controller plugged in to the XIM the mods wouldn't work, if you had a strike pack again the mods wouldn't work. You'd need the cronusmax after the xim input for it to work. After being keyword. 

Also on the CM+XIM combo you need to have the old version of the dualshock 4 (without light strip in TouchPad) to even work.
