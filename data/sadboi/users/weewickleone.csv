mentalhealth,fosslo4,t3_g8w3xj,1588037190.0,"I've found that home doesn't really mean a place,  as much as a feeling of being safe. I've lived a lot of places but only my current place feels like home.  I didn't have a safe place growing up.  So I never felt like I belonged, or was at home. Moving to this place is the first time I genuinely feel safe and wanted. perhaps you're feeling a bit of that,  a need for that safe feeling."
