I wish I knew more people that watched it IRL.  Luckily for me my older sister watches it.  It helped us bond when we reconnected after being absent in each others life.  Better yet her kids watch it now too and when I go over there we all watch it together.  Am grateful to have found this sub.

And fuck it put Lucky on there too because it highlights Ed’s ability to produce weird ambient noises, and Johnny’s composition skills and his ability to make really cool noises and Thom’s playing is great on that too.

I listened to it on a long walk earlier this week.  2+2=5 is absolute banger and sounds like an omen from the past.  The words sting a little harder, his voice haunts like a centuries old ghost.  Lyrically I find a lot of it to be in sync with our quarantine life.  

Sit Down, Stand Up is a gem too.  The 1:56 mark is still one of my favorite vocal performances from Thom.  

All of the little bleeps and bloops and robotic squawks over the album add a nice dimension to the music.  I’d forgotten about a lot of those random noises.  I still wish The Gloaming had that breakdown that it does live.  Sail To The Moon and I Will are gorgeous.  There, There and Myxomatosis are still menacing.  They capture a particular kind of anxiety and dread on A Wolf At The Door that is giving me the creeps right now.

TopsAndBottoms,fmcwivj,t1_fmcgryr,1585954252.0,"Try riding it.  It’s interesting.  Vary speeds.  For the sake of your arm and the benefit of your prostate.  Go fast, go slow, don’t do anything except kegels while it’s in.  The best is to go fast, build and then just stop.  With each successive time you do this, you will get closer.  When it hits, you’ll know.  You’re legs will shake.  You will feel like you are floating in space.  You’ll make a noise you’ve never made before.  And you’ll keep going until it’s so much you have no choice but to stop.  Them you’ll sleep like a baby."
TopsAndBottoms,fmccnbg,t1_fm2ydqj,1585943129.0,"The liquid is prostate fluid.  Totally natural.  You’re getting close but not near the threshold.  It will not feel like a normal ‘wet’ orgasm like when you ejaculate.  

I’d recommend getting an NJoy pure wand (best prostate massager on the market) or a prostate vibrator, something that has a feature for the perineum.  Set aside at least two hours on your own to do it.  It will take some time to build up and cross the threshold.  Once you do it’s pretty amazing and easier to get to.  Don’t touch your dick at all, slowly focus on your prostate.  Cannabis helps you focus and relax, if you use poppers, they will help get you there faster.  If not just know it takes some time.  

It’s highly rewarding once you get there and gets easier and faster.  You’ll feel amazing, be more in touch with your body, sex will be better, and when you do cum it will be unreal."

TopsAndBottoms,fm24fo9,t3_fsk5s0,1585690421.0,"You should look into having prostate orgasms.  They’re perfect for this.  Start with a prostate massage, then a dildo or vibrator.  Don’t touch your dick, just focus on the prostate sensations.  Eventually it builds up and you have full body and later multiple orgasms.  These are called dry orgasms. It takes some time for men to get use to it and what to look for but easier for gay men.  Don’t cum.  At all.  

Next time you bottom will be a blast. The more you do it the better and better it gets.  You’ll soon have prostate orgasms just by getting fucked.  You’ll be begging the top to stop because you’ll need a break from the waves and waves of orgasms.  Eventually you’ll be able to have a hands free orgasm and that involves cumming.  Your top will lose his shit over this and you’ll both be in ecstasy."

You’ve experienced some serious trauma.  Don’t let it go untreated.  If you do you’re possibly opening yourself up to more trauma and before you know it PTSD.  PTSD is no joke.  Panic attacks, disassociation, difficulty controlling emotions.  It makes life more difficult.

I’m speaking from experience.  I’d hate to see the same thing happen to anyone.  Your story sounds very similar to mine.  I let a lot go untreated.  Turn your back on these issues at your peril.  It’s great that your acknowledging it.

As for your sex life.  Maybe have a night a week where your partner focuses on your satisfaction.  Take it slow.  Discover what you like, what makes you comfortable.  Be very open with him.  You’ll both need some patience.  Learn to enjoy it again.  Have fun.  Be goofy.  Laugh.  Get off.  Leave the guilt and hang ups at the door.  Sex is to be enjoyed.  Best of luck to you."

I do realize as we get older we become more self realized and have this understanding of what’s needed from a partner.

I’ve spent the past year and a half or two fixing my life and prioritizing my health.  I’m a much better and easier person to be around now.  I’m fairly sober.  I go to the gym two hours a day.  I have a mentor.  I’ve focused on having healthier relationships and boundaries. 

Which leads me to a friend of mine who is incredibly self destructive right now.  A man whose drinking has cost us our friendship.  I’ve had to remove him from my life after he got really drunk, said and did some really horrible shit to me.  I’ve struggled with some guilt about the boundaries I’ve had to put up.  I can’t help him until he helps himself.  I hope he learns to and finds a way to love himself.  

Watching him is like looking into a mirror.  It’s made me want to reach out to so many people and let them know I finally get it.  That’s the bitch of it - I finally fucking get it.
