bipolar,fk2vcxp,t1_fk15ukw,1583810070.0,"I've always found this to be an interesting topic surrounding the discussion of Bipolar.  Doctor's always say there is no cure.

Given that the widely accepted cause is genetic and environmental with no known ratio, could it be possible that catching it early and getting kids treatment prevents the full-blown expression of Bipolar and the symptoms go away?

I have no idea, but it at least seems plausible.  When someone gets through high school and hits their early 20's, the development of their brain is much further along and they are going to be more set in their ways in terms of how they think and act in the world.  Not to mention, it's likely there was some type of substance abuse involved in the process that a younger child wouldn't have dealt with.

I'd see it almost like you're building a new house, but when you start putting up the first joists for the first floor, you notice a crack in the foundation.  Because you caught it early and it's not buried under the rest of the house it's easy to fix.  The early 20's (or later) is like a tornado hit the house as you were finishing the top floor.  While inspecting the house for damage, you discover a massive crack the the foundation that clearly had been growing for quite some time.  Now you aren't just putting a simple fix on the foundation, you might find yourself doing major renovations on other parts of the house.

I finally got in touch with him about 18 hours after he initially contacted me.  Said he was really on the edge when he sent that message.

He said the reason he reached out to me first was because a few years ago I had shared with him my story about what I've been through with bipolar and how I've managed and made it through.  He said that it was one of the few things that gave him hope yesterday and I was the first one to reach out.

I can't stress the importance of sharing your story with anyone that will listen.  It had to be over 5 years ago that I had talked to him about it.  I never could've anticipated it'd have that effect on him.

You never know who's listening to you, who needs to hear your story at the right time, or how it can impact someone down the road.  We have to share our stories.

work,fi9ar2n,t3_f74sg7,1582259982.0,"A few things stick out after a brief couple months working in retail.  The main two questions I have are:

1. Are you in the U.S.?
2. Is it a large corporation?

If the answer to both questions are yes, the answer is quite simple.  They hired you at the beginning of November to ensure you were ready for the onslaught of holiday season (Black Friday, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, etc).

They never wanted to keep you long-term, which is why they immediately cut hours once January hit.

If you quit, they can just hire someone else at minimum wage and don't have to entertain the idea of giving you a raise at any point.  Most likely they're either going to cut all your hours or flat out let you go.

My suggestion would be find something that more consistent and has some relevance in terms of what you're going to school for.  Even if you have to be the coffee person, you're at least connecting with other people in your field.

If you just need something more consistent places like grocery stores and most in the food/drink industry won't have the same seasonal swings that all clothing retailers will."
personalfinance,fi8j1qk,t3_f6yoa4,1582241414.0,"What about an option I haven't seen mentioned:

1).  Move into the house in FL  
2).  Rent out the house in VA.  Use rent money on mortgage  
3).  Continue paying rent on house in VA as if you lived there.

Using the rent PLUS what you're currently paying monthly on your mortgage would let you pay off your mortgage twice as fast (or more) without negatively affecting your lifestyle.  By the time you were ready to leave FL, you should have a 100% paid off house in VA that you can use to generate revenue through rent, move back into, or sell for profit.

One other thing to consider:  there's no personal income tax in Florida.  While certain aspects in terms of cost of living could negate the difference (outside of rent obviously), you and your wife will effectively get a pay increase even if you make the exact same as you do in VA.

Obviously only looking from a financial standpoint.  The potential relationship issues are a different matter."
bipolar,fi7au6o,t1_fi6u3va,1582217772.0,"Is it really that enjoyable?  I think part of the trap that many people with BP1 fall into is that they look at mania as a pleasurable experience.  In some way, it's almost like a drug addict chasing a high.  You know that high is no good for you, but you long for it because you believe it's the only time you feel free, alive, and capable of doing what you really want.

Then once the high is gone, you're left feeling depressed because you believe that the only you'll ever be alive is if you're high, ignoring all the other repercussions that follow.

This is only from my two full blown manic experiences, so I can't say it's true for everyone:

Full blown mania is maybe fun for like the the first 8-12 hours or so.  Generally this is the time frame where I'm likely not fully aware I'm manic.  I'm happy, everything is right with the world, I can move mountains, etc.  This is what I refer to as the ""talking to random strangers because the universe is interconnected and everything is beautiful and holy shit the sun is shining really bright"" phase.

Then, I hit a point where my thoughts and ideas start racing 1,000 miles a second.  I try to explain to someone what's going on, but I can't make sense of it so how would anyone else understand what I'm trying to explain to them.

I start trying to act on all these ideas I'm having, but since I can't focus I never truly accomplish anything because I'm just jumping to the next idea.

This is the phase where I temporarily lose connection with any sense of consequence or responsibility.  Random sexual acts, spending money at will, ending relationships, breaking things, saying things I don't mean, etc.

After about 24 hours all I really want to do is sleep, but the racing thoughts in my head won't allow it.  Then slowly I become more-and-more irritable and anxiety ridden as I eat like crap and don't sleep.  After about 5 days in both cases is when I ended up in the hospital."

Good advice though on the contract.  I once started a clothing company with two friends.  I came up with the name, logo, every piece of design material, the brand concept, and had  a place to manufacture everything.  So at that point I basically did everything for the brand.

When I presented them with contracts, they couldn't understand why ownership wasn't divided out 33/33/33.  They eventually signed the contract I had, but I don't think they were happy about it and honestly it soured things from the start."

2.  What time do I go to sleep each night?

3.  When do I stop looking at screens (phone, computer, tv, etc)?

4.  When do I typically stop eating for the night?

Those are all going to have a massive effect on how easy it is for you to get out of bed.  You should avoid any caffeine past 2 PM.  You should always aim to get to bed at the same time and get 7-8 hours sleep.  You should stop looking at screens at least 30 min before bed time (60 is preferred).

I say this because as someone who makes his living as an artist, graphic designer, and all around creative person, I would have serious concerns that curing something that effects my emotional and logical response would in fact have negative consequences on my overall thought process and creativity.

The other thing that comes to mind is that brain imaging studies over the past few years have demonstrated that people diagnosed with Bipolar have abnormal brain construction.  The main culprit has been a reduced amount of grey matter in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, all of which influence emotional processing.

Because of that, finding a cure for Bipolar would mean discovering a way to correct this abnormality.  I have no idea how you could realistically alter the structure of the brain without the possibility of some extremely dangerous side effects."

The fact is, especially if you're dealing with a business type client that is highly analytical, they won't even notice.Without knowing all of the details, I don't think you have much to worry about.  Telling your boss is a good move, but try not to be panicked when you do.

Play it off as ""I caught a mistake in the file and I wanted to let you know in case the client contacted us about it.""  Your boss will appreciate not being caught off guard by the situation and it will give him/her time to think of how to handle it if the client contacts the company.

I'm a designer and I'm needing a new (to me) car.  Considering I could use it for networking for that side of the business seems like a huge win if possible."
personalfinance,f2cydrj,t1_f2cs9lg,1570144357.0,"Well yes, but he asked specifically about the investing.  If someone's disciplined enough to put away 25% of their income starting at 18 then he's obviously very disciplined financially.  The original post mentioned savings, but not a specific amount.

As you pointed out, the biggest impact in what you need to save/invest is the type of lifestyle you want to have in retirement.  If your plan is to own a home near the beach in LA, your needs will be significantly different than if you plan to retire in a modest 3 BR house in Omaha or a comparable city.

One last thing.  Original comment doesn't mention what his wage or profession was.  Both can obviously have a massive impact.  25% of $100k/year obviously gets you there faster than 25% of $40k/year if everything else is equal."

work,f2as5ki,t1_f2apjbs,1570117135.0,"Understood, but in your original post you said the issues started happening with the new boss.  If you have an issue with the company and you've been there five years, then it's likely time to move on.  If it's just an issue with this particular person but you like the company and co-workers, don't give up so easy.

Don't assume that the higher up boss won't do anything.  If your direct boss is new and doesn't know what he/she is doing, that can create much larger organizational problems for the higher up.

As others have mentioned, it sounds like you have an ally in your old boss.   Ask them how they think you should handle it.  Set up a time to talk to that person, preferably outside of the workplace.  Perhaps offer to buy them coffee or breakfast one morning before work.

You never know, your old boss could put in a request to have you transferred to their team.  They might be on their way out too and have been looking for someone to join them at their new company.  It's impossible to predict what will happen.  If nothing else, ask for a letter of recommendation or if you can use them as a reference.  If the two of you have a good relationship and you trust this person, nothing bad can come of it."
work,f2aje7j,t3_dcq799,1570114067.0,"Sounds like a terrible boss/manager.  If they're only pointing out negatives but never offering any solutions or suggestions, they're being paid to do something they aren't qualified for.  If you like the company, take the issue higher up and see if you can move into a different position/department with a different manager.

If you don't like the job, start looking.  A person in a leadership role who can't offer solutions or doesn't want to help formulate a plan isn't going to help you that much and likely won't be at the company long because they aren't an actual leader.

The only advice I have:  take whatever negatives he pointed out, figure out which one's are legitimate and which one's aren't, then use the company's resources to plug some of those holes.  Doing that might get you in a better job with the company.  If it doesn't, you'll have polished your skill set so you can find a better situation moving forward.

Also, some managers will point out what you're doing wrong because they want you to find a way to fix those problems.  It's also possible this person is testing your creativity and problem solving skills.  If you can fix these things, you instantly make yourself more valuable in any situation."
Futurology,f21u2sd,t3_dba64v,1569876795.0,"Another thing to consider.  I believe there's life on Mars, just not intelligent life.

The truth a lot of people probably wouldn't want to confront is that if we encounter intelligent alien life forms on Earth, we're likely in trouble because by nature of them reaching Earth they're going to be a far more intelligent species than us."
Futurology,f21rr4m,t3_dba64v,1569875924.0,"Nasa has confirmed that pieces of Mars have been found on Earth.  While it's a huge jump, this would mean it's not out of the realm of possibilities that pieces of Mars or other celestial bodies containing bacteria made their way to Earth millions of years ago and eventually sprouted humanity as we know it."

bipolar,eoaa2ww,t3_bqy498,1558410998.0,"Artist/designer here.  This is really cool.  Would be interesting to see it with color.  For some reason when I looked at this the first thing I thought of was the Yin and Yang symbol.  My random thought is to re-create the same image inside a Yin and Yang symbol.  Would add visual interest as well as deeper meaning.

This is great. I'm just spouting random ideas."
bipolar,eo7yp8u,t1_eo6lt5t,1558352135.0,"No problem!  The other point to that post though that I didn't make real clear.  You might be drinking coffee because you aren't sleeping much, but your lack of sleep could be from the amount or time at which you're drinking coffee.  Then the lack of sleep winds up being why you could be feeling this way."
bipolar,eo6jrja,t3_bqp4gy,1558321199.0,"Are you on vacation at a beach or in a warm environment?  If so, it's possible excessive coffee and heat are making you dehydrated which can affect your lithium levels.

Watch caffeine consumption as well. My Psychiatrist said no more than two caffeinated drinks a day and avoid drinking caffeine after 2pm or else it could effect your sleep.  

I've definitely experienced elevated mood froM drinking too much coffee.  Whether or not it was hypomania I'm not entirely sure to be honest, but i could see it happening."
