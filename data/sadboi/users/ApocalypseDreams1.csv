sex,fibwdgw,t1_fhzokkz,1582331699.0,So great to hear that! :’) since posting my comment I broke up with my emotionally abusive ex and am now with someone who makes my heart sing!
oddlysatisfying,fbf09r1,t1_fbf06rr,1576798261.0,Can confirm this is in fact from the Q-tip brand.
dating,fb43oha,t1_fb3u0gy,1576500702.0,"The only sense in which I was thinking about the past relationship was looking for the signs that I missed back then, and seeing if any of them came about on the date (which they didn’t!). I feel nothing for my past partner, once I found out he cheated on me I lost all respect for him; I’m far too valuable to feel like shit from somebody who would treat me like that when he was never worth my time. There is still some work to be done, but I don’t believe self-improvement is ever truly over anyways."
dating_advice,fb43gsg,t1_fb3ndy3,1576500552.0,"That’s a really great question and I admit, a loose term. I think everyone will have sort of their own way of defining what emotional abuse is, but in my case it was a bad combination of manipulation, disrespect for me and my body, and a lot of gaslighting, all of which I was only able to see once the relationship ended. I know there are worse cases of emotional abuse, and I know I didn’t endure the worst of it for very long in the grand scheme of things, but it was something that negatively impacted me emotionally."
dating,fb439ih,t1_fb3d8mq,1576500409.0,Thank you so much!!
dating,fb31xs5,t1_fb2tv3y,1576462357.0,Thank you so much for your positive feedback and well wishes!!
dating,fb2dxgt,t1_fb2do1k,1576449291.0,"I’d been out of the game for six months, spending that time working on myself not for the purpose of dating, but for my own benefit. I appreciate your feedback, but I believe everyone is different and on their own path. Healing is not linear."
dating,fb1y41r,t1_fb1xq6q,1576442847.0,"This!! I felt so reaffirmed above anything else. I’ve never experienced the physical aspect of abuse, but I thought it was so thoughtful that he asked to hold my hand and then give me a kiss at the end of the night instead of just going for it. I just got this overwhelming feeling that he’s just this super respectful guy and I can’t ask for much more!"
dating_advice,fb1x2tt,t1_fb1wcgl,1576442438.0,"You are so sweet, thank you!!"
dating_advice,fb1x0sp,t1_fb1vzka,1576442417.0,"Great question! I can’t speak for everyone, and this definitely doesn’t happen overnight, but the confidence that I feel now comes as a result of my own doing, not as a response to when others compliment me or give me attention. I used to find myself relying on other people to make me feel better or validate myself worth. That is no longer the case. I find little things that I like about myself and when I catch myself having positive thoughts about some aspect of my being, I hold onto that feeling and really observe it and remember it for days that I don’t feel so great about myself. In terms of body confidence, I’ll spend some time every day, even just a minute or two, looking at myself in the mirror. I do this when I’m wearing a new outfit I bought that I like, or when I’m not wearing anything at all. Of course there are things I’d like to change about my body, but I remind myself that I’m worthy of love, and I’m worthy of respect no matter what I look like. I hope this helps!"
dating,fb1vvs3,t1_fb1py1d,1576441948.0,"You said it perfectly! When you’re finally being treated right it’s so surprising, you almost think you don’t deserve it but then you remember those past partners never deserved YOU."

dating,fb1j17p,t1_fb0la7a,1576437499.0,"I’m so happy to hear about your progress as well! I felt similarly yesterday, it was almost like I didn’t even have to ask him to do/not do certain things, he just sort of did them/didn’t do them without me asking. It was honestly so refreshing and it opened my eyes to the fact that I haven’t been respected in past relationships."

Congratulations on your success, and I in fact think you two are perfect for each other, judging from your post. Practice makes perfect, as they say! I commend you for your patience and perseverance, you are a great man and your girlfriend is so lucky to have you."
Advice,f3mgxrk,t1_f3mg431,1570988040.0,"You’re on the right track already, owning up to the fact that you can’t commit to a relationship is such a level of maturity that some people don’t possess!"
Advice,f3mgg9h,t3_dhdf2j,1570987840.0,"I know you said you don’t have a lot of spare time, but maybe you could take on a hobby that requires little commitment and low effort. It could even be something as simple as using those adult colouring books! Also, self-care is super important, especially when you’re in school and under pressure. Take time to indulge yourself once in a while, even just having a really nice bath or listening to some music. Surround yourself with people who have your best interests at heart and make you feel good about yourself. Evaluate the things that are happening in your life and think of ways to change what’s making you unhappy."
Advice,f3mfobk,t3_dhdh4z,1570987531.0,"I’m 21 F and I’ve definitely fallen into the same mindset before that you have. There are times I catch myself worrying about finding a significant other, but I personally believe that you attract what you put out there. If I’m putting out this desperate energy, then that’s what I’ll get back. My advice to you would be to try and focus your attention on something else, maybe invest time in a hobby you’re interested in. Plus, you could potentially meet people that way too! I’ve used dating apps before and while I’m currently single meaning none of them worked out, I learned a lot from my dating experiences. I’ve never gone to a bar so I don’t have advice unfortunately on that front."
energy_work,f31tmzs,t1_f30rccx,1570584472.0,"Yes, animals are VERY sensitive to this type of energy, and I’ve always believed cats are naturally spiritual beings so that totally makes sense!"
energy_work,f31tkpl,t1_f30nj06,1570584425.0,"The easiest way in my opinion to ground yourself is to notice your surroundings... I use this technique when I start to feel anxiety bubble up to the surface. I’ll make note of 5 things I can see, 4 things I can hear, 3 things I can feel (in the tangible sense), 2 things I can smell, and 1 thing I can taste. The smell and taste senses might be difficult to come up with depending on where you are, so I’ll usually compensate by listing extra things I can see/hear/feel. Hope this helps, give it a try! :)"

energy_work,f30g5fd,t1_f30e8ww,1570553669.0,"True, I think the best way to manage it would be to do a lot of grounding exercises, especially when the full moon is coming up and a few days after it’s passed as the energy is still lingering. Just my opinion though!"

I’ve struggled with anxiety so I know what that feeling is but when it comes to the full moon I’m mostly just a little nervous. I think for me it’s because of the energy that’s present and knowing it’s a really important time."

Soulnexus,f2z0zk0,t1_f2xv7sy,1570503375.0,Wire wrapping sounds like such a fun hobby (or potentially profession)! I feel like I’d be no good at it but then again I haven’t given it a fair shot so I really can’t say. Do you sell your pieces?

Shoestring,f2agrhi,t1_f28zw6k,1570113133.0,Thank you so much for this perspective! From the comments and messages I’ve gotten it seems like doing the whole driving thing means missing out on niche little places that make the trip more memorable. It might be more worth it like you said to break this trip down into smaller bits so I’m not scrambling to do everything.
Shoestring,f2agdrt,t1_f28xdca,1570113001.0,"That sounds like an amazing trip! Since I live in Ontario I’m not really interested in spending much time here since I can do that pretty much any time I want.

I’m not the biggest fan of camping so I’m not sure I’d be into that, but it definitely sounds like a great experience for this kind of trip. I’d be planning on banking myself enough money to afford Airbnb costs, plus hoping to stay at as few as possible. I’m definitely not completely closed off to camping though!"

Since I live in Ontario, I’m not interested in spending much time here since I can do that pretty much whenever I want/have free time. I’ve heard the middle of Canada isn’t that exciting, so I’d definitely want to spend the majority of my time in the Rockies and BC. I was hoping to circle back through the territories towards the east coast, spend some time there and then make my way back to Ontario. As for accommodations, I don’t have a camper but I was thinking of using Airbnb, as a lot of them are pretty cheap. I’d just have to plan it so that I’d be at each specific Airbnb by a specific day. Did I explain that well enough?"
roadtrip,f28toa5,t1_f28oe9g,1570070417.0,Good point! I’m not sure where I’d want to stop along the way and for how long so I’d definitely need to consider that when thinking about timing.

I like the idea of driving only because I can go at my own pace and see what I want to see, but at the same time it’d be a heavy toll on my vehicle and not to mention a lot of work.

I’m on my third week right now and already things have started to get better. I still have bad days (like today), but on the bad days I’m no longer debilitated and I’m able to work through them.
