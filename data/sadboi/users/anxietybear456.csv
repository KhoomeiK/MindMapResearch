He died in 9/11..."
benzorecovery,fm93ofn,t3_ftsend,1585861113.0,"Hi, 

Can you let me know how you've been feeling during your taper? I'm in a very similar position as you and have dropped from 10mg a day to 7.5mg and now at 5mg 3 days a week and 7.5mg 4 days a week. Just curious as to how you are feeling."
benzorecovery,fei5e1w,t1_fecgqri,1579130657.0,"Thanks so much! I started at 15mg, slowly went down to 10mg, and am now at 7.5mg (per day). Slowly but surely I’ll get there. Thanks for the encouragement!"
benzorecovery,fecbvcx,t3_eob359,1578970366.0,That’s amazing!! I’m so happy for you that you made it through to the other side and are doing better. I’m in the middle of my very slow taper now and very very scared of what will happen to me when I jump off. Biggest fear is a seizure. May I ask how many mg you were on?
benzorecovery,f8elyu7,t3_e0j59m,1574530293.0,"Awesome!! So glad you are doing well and feeling better. I’m on a Valium taper right now, going really slow as I crossed over from Xanax and my psychiatrist says that I need to go at a pace that I’m comfortable with. May I ask how many mg of Valium you started on and at what dose you jumped off?"
benzorecovery,f8abugc,t3_dzkb6f,1574393017.0,"Wow. Good for you, that’s honestly quite amazing at such a high daily dose of Xanax. May I ask how long you’d been taking Xanax for prior to stopping?"
benzorecovery,f7y9l7x,t3_dy0p7d,1574090061.0,I’ve had it without taking benzos.
benzorecovery,f7y9htt,t3_dxwntq,1574089995.0,You can do it! Switch over to Valium and do a slow taper while also seeing a psychiatrist.
depression,f7y9ddr,t1_f7xezw7,1574089908.0,"Yeah, just stick with it - it’s kind of an uncomfortable feeling the first couple weeks but you’ll know when it’s working. Good luck!!"
depression,f7xbuwy,t3_dxya6o,1574052039.0,"I have never taken Wellbutrin, but I do take Zoloft which is also an antidepressant and while I know they’re not the same I can tell you that I felt side effects the first few days. I also felt dizzy, foggy, tired, out of it, etc... then, when it kicked in, I felt super hyper and alive and excited and a little edgy anxious. About 2-3 weeks after it evened out and started to work like it was supposed to. I remember the feeling of no longer wanting to lay in my bed and cry and actually feeling like I wanted to go outside and look at the trees and sky. I remember realizing, “okay, so I guess this is what happy feels like.”"
benzorecovery,f7x390o,t1_f7v8iin,1574045075.0,"Yup, I took Xanax for 3 years, tapering off with Valium now. I’d be dead without it."
benzorecovery,f7v3d16,t1_f7t3a5u,1574020259.0,"I had a friend who took about 5mg if Valium a day for years, quit cold turkey with no issues. Everyone is different."
benzorecovery,f7v32gd,t3_dxmwuf,1574020174.0,"It’s difficult but my advice is to go really slow. Also find a psychiatrist that specializes in working with people who are tapering off of medication. I had been on Xanax .5 mg for 3 years then 1mg a day for a few months and my psychiatrist switched me over to Valium and I started a slowwwwww taper. I’m talking about cutting out a fraction of my dose on a specific day of the week every few weeks. This makes it bearable. Your body will absolutely tell you if you’re going to fast. But yeah, my advice: find specialist/psychiatrist who knows and understand the process and doesn’t take withdrawal lightly, switch over to a long acting Benzo, do not take Xanax because it is trash, and go very slow. The slower the better honestly."
benzorecovery,f7k0mh7,t1_f7js05o,1573791401.0,"Thank you so so much! Yeah, I believe she’s the only doctor in my area that understands the difficulty of getting off of benzos and that I need to go at a slow pace. I’m in that position now, where I feel like when I get low it will be awful. Honestly, Valium has really saved my life. I don’t know what I would do or how I would get off of the Xanax without it. It helped me feel normal again and is allowing me to lower the dose slowly. Thanks again for your kind words of support."
benzorecovery,f7jq4sz,t1_f7hlo3s,1573783694.0,Thanks very much!
benzorecovery,f7jpzj6,t1_f7ig3kg,1573783590.0,How long was your taper off of the Klonopin?
benzorecovery,f7jpt6d,t1_f7igl2o,1573783464.0,"Wow! That’s awesome. I’m happy to hear that. But also now concerned that my taper is too slow. And yeah it stays in your system for way longer than Xanax which I guess is why my psychiatrist decided it was the best way to get me off of benzos. I tried to cut down on Xanax before I started seeing her and it was the least fun experience of my entire life. I feel normal on the Valium as well just every time I make a cut, a few days after, things feel more “real” and intense if that makes sense. I’m more emotional and less stable and more anxious for a couple of days but thank goodness it is nothing like the Xanax withdrawals I experienced. It’s just feeling mildly uncomfortable I would say. I’m just worried about what will happen when I do eventually get super low."
benzorecovery,f7hluhc,t1_f7gcy1v,1573743196.0,"I wish they would make a role reversal drug as well to help get people off this stuff. Honestly, if my prescribing doctor had told me back when he first prescribed it how hard it is to get off I would have never touched it. I actually have started taking CBD and it helps me sleep a lot better. I also think it keeps me calmer than I would be without it. As far as weed is concerned, I’ve only smoked a little here and there and I remember I tried some when I was having the Xanax withdrawal and had an awful panic attack - I don’t know if that was because of the weed or because of the withdrawals or both? I’m not surprised that using something natural is more helpful than adding more pills to the mix. How often are you cutting down on the Klonopin if you don’t mind me asking?"
benzorecovery,f7hldmd,t1_f7gcq3u,1573742940.0,"I’m really sorry that happened to your ex. I believe you also need to taper off of SSRI’s such as Zoloft rather than stopping altogether. Anyway, thank you for sharing - I’ll be sure to take it slow once I decide to come off of Zoloft as well."
benzorecovery,f7hl6lv,t1_f7gejq0,1573742834.0,"I’ll buy some today and let you know if it works for me. I read that it helps your neurotransmitters - which get all messed up when stopping or tapering from a Benzo so perhaps that’s why it helped you? Either way, I’ll give it a try."
benzorecovery,f7hkrpg,t1_f7gf2ux,1573742604.0,"Thanks so much for your kind words. If you don’t mind me asking, how long did your taper from 80mg to 2.5mg of Valium take? How did you feel after you stopped taking it? Did you have any seizures?"
benzorecovery,f7hkjlj,t1_f7h7h66,1573742484.0,Thank you. I guess I’m just scared because I hear awful stories of people who have tapered and still have really bad withdrawal symptoms. This is the main reason I’m going so slowly.
benzorecovery,f7gcdge,t1_f7gc2nc,1573700075.0,"Well, I was not going to come off of the Zoloft and Valium at the same time. If anything, I would wait a good year or two after coming off of the Valium to even think about going off of Zoloft. Do you have experience with coming off of Zoloft? If so, would you mind sharing what it was like? I’m on a very small dose of it and it actually prevented me from killing myself due to suicidal thoughts while still on the Xanax."
benzorecovery,f7gc72v,t1_f7gbwhr,1573699946.0,Thanks so much!
benzorecovery,f7gbtug,t1_f7g2o3k,1573699680.0,Thanks so much for the reassurance. I’m trying my best and thank goodness that my psychiatrist understands the need for a slow taper.
benzorecovery,f7gbrb9,t1_f7gbf9b,1573699627.0,Thanks for the advice! Just vitamin B6 in the capsule form?
benzorecovery,f7gbpey,t1_f7g61ex,1573699589.0,Thanks so much! I appreciate it.
benzorecovery,f7g1zoy,t1_f7g14v8,1573692492.0,Wow. I don’t know how you did that but all I can say is keep going. I’ve heard of people still having symptoms months and even a year + later.
benzorecovery,f7g1804,t3_dvzkt9,1573691921.0,You stopped it cold turkey after that many years of use? Wow. That gives me inspiration.
benzorecovery,f7g14a8,t3_dw0idq,1573691843.0,"How long were you on the Xanax for? You just stopped it cold turkey, no taper?"
depression,f7g05yl,t3_dw132l,1573691127.0,Yes. I had this as a symptom of anxiety and depression when withdrawing from Xanax. It sucked.
AskWomen,f6r7qs1,t3_dsgyji,1573095863.0,"Yes. My second job out of college that wasn’t a temp job paid very well and had great healthcare benefits, great location, normal hours, and room to move up within the company. All the things anyone would want. However, my coworkers were hostile and the work environment itself was very cold and corporate and strict. I would not only get reprimanded by coworkers for the way I dressed (if I happened to not wear a suit or be dressed in business professional attire on a Friday, when we were allowed to wear jeans) I would be made fun of. I constantly had to face two particular coworkers who I “managed” but they made me feel incompetent and did not listen to me because they were both women in their 40s whereas I was only 23 at the time. Amongst other things. Any mistake or error was turned into a big deal and my manager would never help me through it, but would give me a strict warning instead. Anyway, after almost 2 years of suffering through it and drinking a bottle of wine almost every night after work to help forget the day, I had a huge mental breakdown and this is when my anxiety really started. I went on FMLA and while on FMLA decided to look for a new job. I found a part-time, entry-level, receptionist job at a small nonprofit. It paid much less than my previous job but once I started there my life changed drastically. Did I miss the money? Yes. Were there challenges? Yes. But I no longer dreaded going to work and actually made friends with my coworkers who were kind, smart, understanding, and willing to work with me rather than against me. I stayed at that job until the nonprofit was forced to close due to funding and still have good memories of that job. It helped me get back to a state of equilibrium after a very difficult and stressful time in my life created by my previous work environment."

depression,f23udgq,t3_dbrnb7,1569937858.0,"32. I started experiencing actual depression just last year; however, have had anxiety for as long as I can remember. Was officially diagnosed last year when I finally saw a psychiatrist."

depression,f1k5sn8,t3_d9f2m4,1569532130.0,"Yes. A million times yes. I have a supportive family, a loving boyfriend, an amazing job where I work from home and make more money than I ever have, my own apartment, a sweet cat, a fairly good psychiatrist (most of the time) and I still manage to screw up every day. My anxiety and depression does not allow me to see everything in perspective, and instead highlights the negatives of my day/life therefor making everything a struggle for me and having the ""woe is me mentality."" You're not alone, believe me."
