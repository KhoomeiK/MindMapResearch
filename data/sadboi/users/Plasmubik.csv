For another, other states and other countries are already starting to see success with their partial re-openings. Is LA really going to be able to justify this until August as they see places all around the world starting to open up, and without spikes in cases?

Anxiety,fpwj76y,t1_fpwipq9,1588964393.0,"Looks like it, if they meet certain requirements. From the same article:

""The state will allow some regions in the state with fewer Covid-19 cases and deaths to further reopen if they meet a laundry list of requirements. Here's some of what's required for counties to relax restrictions:

* No more than 1 coronavirus case per 10,000 people for two weeks, and no Covid-19 related deaths for 14 days.
* A minimum daily capacity to conduct 1.5 tests per 1,000 residents, and at least 15 contact tracers per 1,000 residents.
* Availability of housing for at least 15% of homeless residents, along with sufficient disinfectant supplies and protective gear.
* Skilled nursing facilities must have a 14-day supply of PPE"""

Anxiety,fpwaea7,t1_fpw653e,1588959997.0,"California is beginning to loosen some lockdown restrictions as of today. Here's what CNN is listing as opening (not linking the article, since I know news sites can be triggering):

* Select retailers with curbside pickup and delivery options. In-store shopping is still not permitted.
* Examples: Clothing, home and furniture, books, music, sporting goods, florists, etc.
* Some industries with workers spaced farther apart, using protective gear and sanitizing equipment.
* Examples: Manufacturing, warehouses, businesses with telework capability, construction, auto dealerships and car rentals

Given that California has been one of the most aggressive states in terms of lockdown restrictions, it seems to me like a good sign that they feel good about starting to ease things back."

SaltLakeCity,fptrsiw,t1_fptr2df,1588896961.0,"The concept of ""alpha"" doesn't really apply to dogs at all. The original study on alpha wolves was shown to be faulty (and admitted by the author of that study). People still seem to think that applies to dog psychology though, which it really doesn't. It leads people to try a sort of ""dominance"" approach to training their dogs, which doesn't work nearly as well as positive reinforcement training."
