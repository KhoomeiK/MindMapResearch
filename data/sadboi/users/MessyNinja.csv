Thank you for this, you just replied in the right time, in the moment I just feel shit and depressed abot my social life and then you replied.

I will try to go outside my comfort zone I think that's the only real way to face your fears, I may get really anxious but anxiety is just temporary feeling, it goes away, it may comeback, I just need to do the uncomfortable thing again.

I may not do things that you do like calling out people at stores lol but maybe I can start by saying the things that pops up in my head rather than not talking or overthinking bullshit things, and I will try to say no sometimes because I am slowly becoming a yes man, and I'm gonna back to working out and meditating tomorrow, I got really depressed this day and I stopped that things, but Ima go back tomorrow no excuses.
