AskReddit,fpq5yyv,t3_gekt3w,1588815839.0,I’m sure there are much worse out there but I used to install security systems. I stopped installing motion sensors unless customers specifically requested them when I found out the company I worked for recorded peoples movements inside their homes and sold that data to larger corporate entities. That was just the last straw for me. I already knew that salesmen were falsifying credit information and pulling shit like selling outlandish packages to people they knew would default on their payments and taking equipment from the customers for themselves and a lot of other shit.
Anxiety,fpmbpjv,t3_gdwcei,1588729624.0,I get this all the time. Except instead of crying I get a very short temper and tend to snap at people. I just have to go sit somewhere quiet for awhile and pull myself back together. Quiet music helps too.
WalgreensStores,foo41bk,t3_g8kivd,1587932076.0,"From what I saw on the website it has been extended through the end of May.
Edit: from the April 10th update on the wba website. 
“Out of an abundance of caution, we are making additional changes to our pay and benefits guidance, as well as extending our relaxed attendance policy through the end of May.”"
Anxiety,foa8lau,t3_g6kr4d,1587642118.0,"I switched from escitalopram to duloxetine (cymbalta) 30mg twice daily and have had great results libido wise. And while it has helped with (some) of my depression issues and is helpful with my fibromyalgia as well, I have had issues with my anxiety since the switch. Also it can be a rough transition because it takes a few weeks for the medication to build up in your system enough to really see any results."
Anxiety,fo8dcor,t1_fo89xo0,1587594403.0,I’m looking into that but then I worry about my coworkers. We’re always understaffed but I tried going in last week for two days and had to leave because I started vomiting and had horrible diarrhea. I don’t want to be a burden. I just feel stuck.
Anxiety,fo88619,t1_fo86nr9,1587591645.0,Nope. The only thing our corporate office has done for us is say we can each have 3 face masks per week. And can wear gloves if we choose to. Then our regional manager told us not to because they won’t actually help and they scare the customers.
WalgreensRx,fo81g7r,t3_g67sxe,1587588211.0,I had heard that there was a uniform change coming but no details as to what they would look like.
mead,fnuunq5,t1_fntugwo,1587271540.0,That’s what really pushed me too! Saw them live in Chicago when they toured with achievement hunter for let’s play live. Was a great show.
IDOWORKHERELADY,fntwkxy,t3_g3pvbf,1587249978.0,Having done private security work I can honestly say mistakes like this happen all the time. The main thing is for everyone to try and keep a cool head. It’s when security gets little dick syndrome that things go bad. Just hear people out and check through the proper channels and 9 times out of ten things go smoothly. But man when they don’t? They really don’t.
AskRedditAfterDark,fn99335,t1_fn8fbv4,1586763824.0,Thanks!
AskRedditAfterDark,fn7g1z3,t1_fn65shv,1586719611.0,Lol your not far off but more for her. After a recent colonoscopy I realized I am firmly in the exit only camp.
AskRedditAfterDark,fn60699,t3_fzos8w,1586682295.0,"Yes. Long story short I had some bad experiences when I was very young that led me to seeing sex as something I could/had to do for someone if they needed it and asked. And for some reason I seem to be that safe friend to ask. 
I had a friend who I would hangout with often but I was not attracted to at all that kept asking me to take her virginity. I finally relented because she wanted her first time to be with someone she really trusted."
AskRedditAfterDark,fn5z8q5,t3_fzrlt8,1586681263.0,Definitely better married. My wife(36) and I(35) have been together for almost 14 years and our sex life definitely slowed down after we had kids. But now that they are older and we get more time to ourselves we have both been able to really explore our sexuality and open up about our needs and fantasies. I have so much fun finding outfits and toys for her to try and our sex life has never been better.
entitledparents,fmx1xxw,t1_fmw7ykv,1586457014.0,Hey that’s not fair. Shit is at least useful.
WalgreensStores,fmfo85n,t3_futfjc,1586031397.0,I can’t believe your store manager is ok with this. We can’t even put up something saying one of our tills is down. If it doesn’t come straight from corporate as approved signage we can’t use it. Well I hope it works!
TalesFromThePharmacy,fmama3h,t1_fma6d1o,1585899154.0,Walgreens corporate actively tells us to not use ppe as “it will scare customers”.
WalgreensStores,fm89apx,t1_fm7ze66,1585845197.0,Already done.
entitledkids,fl8wqga,t1_fl8u9o9,1584934275.0,Underrated comment right here.
pharmacy,fkzijb1,t1_fkyhjz9,1584671816.0,I was asking about did I do the right thing in a pharmacy setting while we are all so swamped. But thanks Dick bag.
pharmacy,fkyeae7,t1_fky3nlt,1584647027.0,Logically I know it’s the right call. But we have already been running short handed and I feel terrible for placing more burden on my coworkers. But seeing as Walgreens isn’t really giving us ppe or other safety measures I just don’t see another option.
pharmacy,fky22ev,t1_fky17w0,1584639891.0,I’m supposed to be trying to avoid ibuprofen anyway do to other medical issues but it seems to be the only thing that helps with my arthritic hands and hip. Sigh. But now that I’m home for a week I guess that being able to move around isn’t as important.
WalgreensStores,fky1r2r,t3_fldck9,1584639714.0,I just got the news from my doctor that there no tests available in my area (northern Minnesota). I’m to self isolate for 7 days and go in if my breathing worsens. Sounds like I may have made the right call.
pharmacy,fky1dvm,t1_fkxy22a,1584639507.0,I finally got through to my doctor. And they recommend at least a 7 day quarantine to assess my symptoms. They have no tests in my area. I’m in northern Minnesota. At least walgreens is offering up to 2 weeks of sick pay for all employees right now. But I’m worried about my coworkers and customers.
WalgreensStores,fkxxsj1,t1_fkxxbtu,1584637493.0,I just feel horrible. My pharmacy is slammed right now and I now my anxiety is doing a number on me right now but what if it’s just a cold? Or my allergies and asthma?
pharmacy,fkxx51h,t3_fldbkt,1584637125.0,Also my wife works in the kitchen of the local highschool. She still has to go in even though the schools are shut down. They have to make bag breakfasts and lunches for kids that there families can pickup so that low income families can still make sure their kids get at-least those meals. And I’m worried about her.
PharmacyTechnician,fkhkq8r,t1_fkg6owr,1584200926.0,As a whole I love my job. But Walgreens does have a few policies/practices that get tiresome. They always want you to push certain metrics some of which just don’t seem to work. Like their satr (save a trip refill) I almost never bring it up to customers because it tends to make it harder on everyone. Other than that just take your time learning the specifics of your state’s insurance plans and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Everyone was new at one point. Even people that have gone through one of the tech school programs will have questions. And as far as dealing with unruly customers goes just kill them with kindness. And try to remember that the majority aren’t even really upset with you just the situation they are in. And the grumpy ones are usually the exception. My store really tries to push the team mentality. We succeed or fail as a group. Also don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Everyone has made some. There are safeguards in place for that very reason. Just keep a cool head you got this!
PharmacyTechnician,fkg2o02,t1_fkf27i6,1584148454.0,I (35M) did the same thing in Minnesota. Had no prior pharmacy experience but answered all interview questions confidently and tried to relate experiences in my past to show how I could be an asset. Most chain pharmacies expect to have to train new techs and will usually pay for you to get certified. That’s what Wallgreens did for me :)

TalesFromThePharmacy,fcws1o5,t1_fcw6v7j,1578035310.0,What are these breaks you speak of? In our pharmacy we don’t take them. Unless your scheduled for a 12 hour shift then maybe a 30 minute lunch... maybe.
WalgreensStores,fb1bvdu,t3_eb0a90,1576434667.0,This is why I’m glad I’m in the pharmacy. I just type in the number on their rx and 99% of the time it works. And the other 1% don’t want one.
Zoomies,f9yzvwh,t3_e7elst,1575736211.0,Can confirm. When I bring my daughters to my mom’s house her chickens come running and get offended if my kids don’t pick them up and hug them.
PharmacyTechnician,f91wl3l,t1_f8ubjfw,1575003639.0,Where did you work? I’m in northern MN and we’re perpetually short staffed. Also I got the $1 bump recently when I passed my ptcb test. And a .53 cent cost of living increase.
PharmacyTechnician,f8ocpsv,t3_e1apvu,1574673690.0,I started at Walgreens as a tech about a year ago at 13.50 an hour and now I make 15.03 and should be getting another raise soon. Definitely take your skills elsewhere.

PharmacyTechnician,f8ajdyz,t1_f87etlf,1574399090.0,I started at 13.50 and it took just over a year for me to hit 15. I would recommend working at Walgreens. It’s a quality company.
PharmacyTechnician,f87epyd,t3_dzg4yr,1574329605.0,"I think pay is based on location and experience but I’ve been a tech with Walgreens for about a year and make a little over $15 per hour. If you make senior tech the pay is 16.50 as far as the prior I think it depends on the store manager and other applicants. Walgreens tends to run their pharmacies lightly staffed so your always busy which is nice but can make new techs burn out. 
All in all it’s a pretty good company to work for. Decent benefits and yearly reviews and raises."
PharmacyTechnician,f87dpvs,t3_dz5xjf,1574327957.0,Congrats! I passed mine last Saturday!

PharmacyTechnician,f7uvjr1,t3_dxa3ge,1574018321.0,We have a couple of part timers too. We’re not a 24 hour location and a busy day for us is about 500 scripts. Just ask your store manager about getting into one of the ptcb courses they offer every 2 months or so. It consists of 4 classes over the course of 4 weeks. Then you take a pre test on store net and if you pass that you can schedule your exam and the company will pay for it. Also there is an optional refresher before the test. All of the classes are payed your regular pay rate and if you have to travel you get mileage as well.
PharmacyTechnician,f7pza8t,t1_f7pyhpr,1573956585.0,Nice. I’ve been working at Walgreens for about a year as a tech. I was finally able to do the ptcb course. It took awhile because I’m one of only 2 full time techs at our pharmacy.
PharmacyTechnician,f7oy0rf,t3_dxa3ge,1573937212.0,Me too! I just took my test today. What did you do to prepare?
