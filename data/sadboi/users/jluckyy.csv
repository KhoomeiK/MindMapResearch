AskReddit,fbshc0b,t3_ee3b1i,1577055222.0,"27m. Usually before I sleep or just as I wake up this voice in my head tells me I am a useless loser. I unconciously think of sad and lonely moments of my life. I always tear up when I see photos or videos of moms and dads loving their children then wish I had those moments when growing up. Everyday I feel like an outcast, broken and weird compared to normal people. Prob the most difficult thing to do is trying to love myself. I always wish to find someone that could love me as much as I could love them but this is life and I feel dreams should be left as fantasies. If there was an opportunity to die without doing it myself I would take it within a heartbeat. Living in this world sometimes is too much to bear and I just want to stop thinking and feeling.  As selfish as this may come across I just want to be free of my mental prison"

depression,excp7we,t3_cs1z6y,1566156187.0,"I feel the same way OP. Personally I feel without motivation, ambition, passion, and overall willingness to live. Just feeling like a complete waste. I grew up without any role models and didn't understand what love was until I was 17 years old and noticed how other parents treat their children. I am 27 now and more lost than envious. I ask myself why not do the world a favor and leave this place for the more well-developed? Life is pointless and you simply just find things to live for. So isn't safe to say some people just ain't got shit to live for? Sorry for rant mate.. I just feel ya"
