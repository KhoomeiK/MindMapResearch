depression,fm1f0v3,t3_fsg8zk,1585677219.0,"im dreading the day this happens to my cat. i have nothing else happy in my life and im currently battling depression and rejection from my parents who are very emotionally abusive and manipulative and im trying to combat that and the only thing that sooths me in my tears is the embrace of my 12yo cat he sometimes makes me cry harder and he notices that im sad and i dont know what id do if i lost him so im deeply so sorry for everything ur going through especially because he is still around like a constant reminder that he will never be the same so im so sorry, ino it wont be the same but just treasure him until hes truly gone and u will have to treasure that he is still here holding on"
depression,fm1dot8,t3_fs78rp,1585676539.0,I guess what i do when im feeling like this is i try to just make other peoples lives happier in hope that it would happen but i guess it doesnt always work cus whenever i get confronted i hide or even if i get a message of someone that isnt like close i freak and start to panic for no reason cus i think they just want to fight me i guess u just have to find the positives even if it means u are alone
