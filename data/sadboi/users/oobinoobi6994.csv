SpidermanPS4,fqrom5m,t3_gkhqfn,1589588619.0,I just finished the game as well today.
Needafriend,ffdb6zl,t1_ffdaon0,1579817112.0,"Oh, okay. I have Discord if you do. Ummm... and yeah."
Needafriend,ffd8qk8,t3_esyh8m,1579815625.0,"Hello human. I'm 16M, and am super boring. So if that's okay, then I'm here."
yesyesyesyesno,ff4vl26,t1_ff4viwy,1579573491.0,Go on
Needafriend,ff0c7p9,t3_eqy7tm,1579467543.0,"Sup. I've got discord and have many friends on there that I talk to often. So if you're into talking, I'm down."
Needafriend,ff0btwk,t3_er1tvf,1579467385.0,"Discord is my main source of talking to people. So, yeah. There ya go."
Needafriend,fev6a0t,t3_eqn5gb,1579393553.0,"I'm 16m and have discord and a PS4. I'm mostly on PC, but I do have discord, so yeah."
Needafriend,fev5nm2,t3_eqispc,1579393415.0,"Hello. I've been browsing this subreddit and also posted. A lot of people seem to have discord. I have it as well. It would seem cool to have a discord server. I'm just waiting for responses from people. It may turn out to be nothing, but it may be cool. idk"
Needafriend,fev4ucx,t3_eqm2uk,1579393101.0,"I just posted on this subreddit. It says some stuff about me. I have OCD and bipolar disorder. I can chat with anyone really. I'm pretty chill and also have discord. So, yeah."
OCD,feanamd,t3_eo8eyo,1578950520.0,"I watched the joker as well. It really weighed on me. It was definitely too real for me. I was thinking, ""what if that will be me?"" Definitely not to that level. Still"
bipolar,fe2n13e,t1_fe2gzh8,1578840748.0,I haven't even heard of that. I'll look into it.
OCD,fdzu8sg,t3_engck4,1578795922.0,"If it's going to trigger me, why would I watch it?"
bipolar,fdzs861,t1_fdzryhc,1578794567.0,"Even if you aren't a professional, that was great. Thanks for the information. I never thought about it like that. Thank you."
bipolar,fdz03ez,t3_en5c5w,1578785375.0,"Oh shoot, I'm on that same med."
depression,fdyydoe,t3_endrue,1578784800.0,"I don't know how to react. This seems like a real life horror story. I'm really sorry. I know sorry doesn't really help or matter in this situation. Especially if you know you can't really bring anyone back. All you can really do is blame someone. That is sometimes the best you can do. Until you can release yourself from this, just keep going."
depression,fdyxn7l,t3_en5e2r,1578784614.0,"My mom says, ""that's not depression"" a lot. She doesn't know what I'm feeling though. It seems that that's how it may seem to others. Just because you may look the same as us at some points, doesn't mean you have depression. Depression isn't something you just say. It is a serious mental illness."
depression,fdyx45s,t3_encfer,1578784434.0,"I'm younger (almost 16) and don't really understand relationships or stuff like that. I do understand though about feeling like you're always being left out. It's just that I don't know how to interact with people. I don't really have friends at school, or in general. I'm not meaning for you to have sympathy for me. I'm just saying that maybe (not to say that you don't) social skills aren't your strong suit? I don't know. That's at least the way I feel."
depression,fdyvskx,t3_en8c5n,1578784065.0,"I'm going to save this post, and read it later on my computer. I don't mean to offend you. It's just that it's a little hard to read right now."
OCD,fdy7w8i,t1_fdy7rin,1578776976.0,"lol, it's a tiny rolling pin. I don't know why I have it. I'm kind of a small hoarder."
OCD,fdy77ey,t1_fdy5j5x,1578776825.0,"Yeah. I'll probably move that. It's a plush soccer ball from a long time ago. It doesn't fit, but it's special to me."
depression,fdxnknn,t3_en7336,1578770934.0,"I feel you. This bothers me a lot as well. I want to just leave myself behind and go find a new body, but at other times, I just want to sulk in my pain. It really is confusing. I haven't found a way to do anything about it yet."
Needafriend,fdtp7we,t3_en17a3,1578720072.0,"I love animals maybe a bit too much. I play video games. I have a big amount of mental baddies. And yeah.

Also garlic bread is pretty good ngl.

I'm going to have to say no to watermelons. Both color and taste of the candies lol."
depression,fdtnmt1,t3_ee58qm,1578719391.0,"I don't want to share too much, but my mother does share a lot with her friend. I don't like it. She's on a lot of the day just talking and talking to her friends. It does bother me. I've never really said anything about it though."
depression,fdtmzkt,t3_eb0ggo,1578719117.0,"It may have something to do with bipolar disorder. I have these kind of episodes. It does take a toll on you. I'm still working on myself. Just try to talk to people about it. They may not want to hear what you're saying, but at least try to write/type down why you're thinking"
bipolar,fdtmetf,t3_en2j0u,1578718870.0,"I'm sorry about what's happening. I don't really know what to say most of the time. I'm not too good at sharing. When I can, I think I share too much. I'm sorry again."
yesyesyesyesno,fdh6q1v,t3_el041e,1578416567.0,"All of these comments talking about 9/11. I get that it was sad and disturbing for US citizens. When you think about the world around the US, you can see the trauma. Even natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. They effect so many people, too. I am always thinking about other people. I don't like living in the US if I'm being honest. I just think people in the US and in some other countries are too oblivious to what's happening around the world. Like the wild fires in Australia. Some stuff can effect whole countries. A lot of countries. War to some people seems like honoring a country. To me, it's just an exuse to fight. We're fighting ourselves. This is just what I think about. I'm sorry to whomever I might've offended through any of this."
mildlyinfuriating,f6srvg1,t3_dsszqz,1573138887.0,I used to have 70 tabs on a MacBook pro. So many that the computer wouldn't charge. I had to open it up and close a few tabs and it would shut down.

pics,f60wkre,t1_f60t983,1572627680.0,I had sprained it a couple weeks ago. This time I just jumped over something and my ankle just gave in.
pics,f60onbm,t1_f60ofly,1572622383.0,Nope just my foot
pics,f60od6r,t1_f60obur,1572622194.0,Okay thanks
pics,f60obd9,t1_f60o9tu,1572622161.0,It feels kinda weird but it doesn't hurt as much as it looks.
mildlyinteresting,f60ln3z,t1_f60ll2f,1572620328.0,Thanks for correcting me
teenagers,f608el3,t1_f5xnjd3,1572609573.0,I assume so
teenagers,f5xmtj0,t3_dpiycc,1572543170.0,Haha. I'm going to try to be a goth guy/girl. Just thought of it. Not really creative.
teenagers,f5xmozi,t3_dpquce,1572543115.0,"Better than I could do. I only draw, but in pencil. I don't know how to judge it or if I should at all. I like it."
teenagers,f5xmipk,t3_dpqucu,1572543042.0,I don't really know what to say. I've never really been in your position. Just be yourself. It doesn't matter if she's your crush or not. Act normal. That's it.
teenagers,f5xm01n,t1_f5xlx0n,1572542823.0,Whatcha got in your collection?
lossedits,ex3pc5e,t1_ex37i1y,1565989121.0,That's so true
