AnimalCrossing,fqmy65e,t3_gjtfih,1589485494.0,"My friend and I have an inside joke where we say ""chicken on the bone, btw"" or ""chicken on the bone actually""... long story... anyway...

She taught one of her villages to say it as their catch phrase and it's slowly spread to each of her villagers over time. I get a kick out of it every time I visit her town and a villager says it to me. 

CHICKEN ON DA BONE, BTW....."

depression,f25gvha,t3_dbt5ps,1569974208.0,"This happens to me a lot, too. I second guess and doubt myself and what I can contribute to conversation, so I stay quiet and everyone thinks I'm this super shy person who doesn't say much but really I can be pretty extroverted and goofy when I am comfortable. I just find it takes me awhile to feel comfortable around people before I open up to them and I wish I wasn't like that. I have been like this since childhood. I haven't figured out how to turn my self-doubt off and just be confident enough to be myself. üò∂"
