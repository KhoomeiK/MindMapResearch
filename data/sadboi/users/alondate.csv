Now I am into black/death/doom metal these days. If you like depressive stuff then try Agalloch, Novembre, Woods of Ypres."
ForeverAlone,fk85umy,t3_fguz53,1583949927.0,Video games and metal music mostly. I am an english language teacher with pre-school kids. I really like spending time with them. It is the only time that I don't plan my suicide
Spyro,fk38hti,t1_fk25lnc,1583821725.0,You can turn off the blur motion in the settings menu. It will help a lot.

Metal,fbgm6xi,t3_ed8dql,1576853227.0,This one came out early this year and I still listen to it. It is beyond amazing. II-I is simply mesmerizing. Go for it if you love aggresive black metal.
PS4,fann24i,t1_fanfgfx,1576245531.0,It is very sad. I was going to buy Control
Metal,f7whc0x,t3_dxg43s,1574033229.0,I really like it. Black Waves is a great song.
PS4,f5p6mmk,t3_doi2si,1572350611.0,Yes! It is one of my favorite indie games this generation. It is extremely addictive. Cool OST. Super fast gameplay. Pretty colorful. A nearly perfect game in my opinion. Also got the platinum which is hard to obtain :)
PS4,f464bce,t1_f45khkl,1571403866.0,"I have. And I said ""one of the""."
PlayStationPlus,f3risag,t1_f3qenaf,1571088474.0,I think it was on sale one or two weeks ago. In EU Store.
PS4,f23qx0w,t3_dbsfvq,1569935198.0,That's great but as far as I know it is only available on UK and France in EU. So a lot of us folks still cannot use this service. What a shame.
Trophies,f1vz51m,t1_f1vvcft,1569777997.0,"Much, much better than those games. It was made by the famous Housemarque. About difficulty I would say if you aren't good at arcade shooter games than it is a solid 7 or 8. Otherwise it is hard but doable."
PS4,f0dudft,t3_d4b9n6,1568558733.0,It looks extremely refined. So hyped to play it again
ForeverAlone,ey2zzgw,t3_cv7l9o,1566752097.0,Yeah but I think living alone is worse than it. You die every second instead of just one time
depression,exrn2mr,t3_cu18rk,1566519165.0,This is like a black hole. Once you stuck in there is no escape. I cannot be happy even if i have everything. And i lost my will to live

depression,ewh1ybt,t3_co7p00,1565395827.0,Yeah. I wish I was a dauntless man instead of a milquetoast. So I could commit suicide
depression,ew5lwf9,t3_cmxltz,1565139428.0,"I think therapists are like what if meme advices such as, ""take a shower bro!"" could become a body and soul. Sometimes even your friends and family don't give a shit about you. How a stranger would help you in any way?"

depression,ew2qqfz,t3_cmgpe0,1565053468.0,"Simple. They deceive themselves. A person who is aware what is real or not wouldn't care about such fake things. But each to their own, I suppose."

depression,ew2owo2,t3_cmgr19,1565052167.0,It may sound meme advice but you can do anything you want by yourself alone. I know hanging alone make you feel weird a lot at first but you get used to it
ForeverAlone,evz17sl,t3_clx952,1564946442.0,Yeah. And I think they are much more meaningful than just sex. A lot of people who have low sex-drive are like this.

Cringetopia,euete3v,t3_cg2hnf,1563753415.0,This is the reason why I have absolutely zero hope for human kind.
ForeverAlone,euen3eo,t3_cg2fc6,1563748567.0,Same here. Okay the problem may be about luck or other stuff but getting into this point was my own doing. I admit that. Now I try to change but I generally feel like it is too late although I am still 24

PlayStationPlus,euc3pnk,t3_cfoxso,1563664202.0,If you are not into indie games then it means you miss a ton of good games

ForeverAlone,eu26ma8,t3_cefc13,1563383463.0,"Firstly, don't give a fuck about anyone. Secondly, also, no one gives a damn about you. So I don't feel any pressure on me. I wear my headphones, play my favorite metal band and go wherever I want. Pool, cinema, cafe etc. 

And I strongly think hanging out alone is better in some occasions. Because no one drags you down like this, ""Aww I dont wanna watch this movie it sucks. I don't wanna go there it is boring."" I basically become my own god. It is nice."
ForeverAlone,etxjf8h,t3_cdywti,1563300634.0,These normies are so weird. They think everything is magically super easy and assume you don't struggle for the things you want.
ForeverAlone,etwk6rk,t3_cdusjx,1563274458.0,It is sad but that's just the way of the world. Looks are pretty much everything. You become a better person in people's eyes automatically if you have a good look. No one cares if you are kind or friendly as long as you are not handsome or beautiful.

I humbly want to give an advice for you. Never accept a one night stand. They are either a psycho or a gold digger. Those amazing one night stands only occur in movies. So, be self protective at all times. Even if you are an eternally FA. Fapping, sitting in front of a computer or console is much better than this type of shit."
