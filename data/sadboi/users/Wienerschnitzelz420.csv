The first months went great, full of motivation, proud that I kicked the habit, After that I started to realize how fucked up smoking actually is. I was also smoking spliffs so I was like 'yoooo wtf was I doing!?' I can easily get cancer before I'm 40 because of this. There's also a picture of a guy coughing up blood at 35 bc of lung cancer on this sub. I started feeling like such a retard. 

Also became really scared and stressed out about dying young. Constantly stressing made me even more depressed. I gave myself a burn-out and convinced myself I was about to die. Gave up all hope. Couldn't leave my bed anymore. Did some irrational shit like contacting my ex and telling her I'm going to die soon. She used it to take revenge and shit on me like a little child. Very satisfied with herself that she could get under my skin, but that's my own fault for contacting someone like that. I talked with so many people convinced my life is soon over and I was so incredibly depressed. 

Recently I've been doing better though. I was also working out a lot so I'm seeing a lot of progress and since I stopped stressing so much, I'm getting more hopeful that I'll live a long life. I still missing smoking a little bit. Would do it again in a heartbeat if I can get away with it without dying young."
