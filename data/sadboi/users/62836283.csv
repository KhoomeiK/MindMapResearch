AskReddit,foiq8ul,t3_g7id84,1587793576.0,Prefer? Or am more frightened by? Prefer is an odd word in this situation.
BadMensAnatomy,fnocyds,t1_fnocu25,1587120879.0,I agree but I don't think you look like that at a BMI of 16
AskReddit,fncp31i,t1_fncoszm,1586842736.0,Coz it kills them
BadMensAnatomy,fn9yjk9,t1_fn9mj3s,1586787465.0,Yeah I think there's the possibility to be fit and muscular at most bmis ... Less likely at a low bmi though because muscle is heavy ... But you won't look exactly the same at all bmis
BadMensAnatomy,fn9cvfu,t1_fn9cu8m,1586768031.0,Sure I agree but generally speaking you won't have a six pack at every BMI
badwomensanatomy,fjorymk,t1_fjmpgip,1583533661.0,"... only in the sense that all abdominal organs, stomach, colon etc are ""kind of"" by the lungs"
badwomensanatomy,fjorooe,t1_fjonmxe,1583533513.0,Yeah but how come it didn't get a handy dandy label
AskReddit,fit8d79,t1_fit8c5d,1582709240.0,Well that's great ... How did you get a car to run for nearly 30 years
AskReddit,fit7f7g,t1_fit4i1k,1582707959.0,And it still works??
BadMensAnatomy,fh4r238,t1_fh2tmz7,1581281320.0,Exactly why I don't go to the gym.
BadMensAnatomy,ffqrj7l,t1_fe4ghb9,1580141984.0,I mean ... Hairloss is not just your testosterone levels but also how receptive your cells are to testosterone.
BadMensAnatomy,ffqr8k4,t1_fewnsni,1580141783.0,It is but I'm pretty sure from context they just mean Asian people in this case ... Not that that's better.
BadMensAnatomy,ffqqyjy,t1_ff2028u,1580141595.0,I don't think that's what most of us were focussing on
AskReddit,ffc22zo,t1_ffbu4xu,1579789593.0,Yeah but not south of there ... Melbourne and Adelaide insist they don't have any.
BadMensAnatomy,fe5pcfw,t3_enqa3p,1578872498.0,Does this mean vegans are sterile?
HydroHomies,fd7c5b8,t1_fd3xf8o,1578202214.0,How does not drinking water give you diabetes?
BadMensAnatomy,fckcyye,t1_fbd5eht,1577722547.0,That is a thing ... But not because people did this obviously
BadMensAnatomy,fafm5a0,t3_e8s9xi,1576026239.0,Tbh even he doesn't look like he's enjoying it.
Anxiety,f6jtjew,t1_f6hdtes,1572899996.0,Please don't do this. Vitamin d is fat soluble and thus can build up in your body. There is such a thing as overdosing on vitamin d.
Adulting,f4648gh,t1_f452y8a,1571403833.0,I would suggest that unless you live alone you assign someone else to this chore and they use their pillowcase.
UnethicalLifeProTips,f2qviaw,t1_f0dqckb,1570367087.0,Yeah ... That's not routine procedure anymore ... Natural tears heal much quicker than cuts made by a medical professional.
LifeProTips,f2quh6c,t1_f2qtu1g,1570366774.0,X rays no but CT (cat) scans that take lots of x-rays all at once to get a more complete picture of for instance your brain? Hell yes
LifeProTips,f2d2p4p,t1_f2d2hre,1570146150.0,No fair enough ... I'm a nurse ... I've just never thought about how paracetamol would work topically.
Anxiety,f2d21t4,t1_f0kt4oa,1570145872.0,Matcha has more caffeine than regular green tea so I don't know if it's the best choice if tapering off is your goal. However it is the best choice for tastiness.
LifeProTips,f2d1ru1,t1_f2d1kxb,1570145733.0,I mean admittedly the normal way will probably take longer but long term effectiveness definitely better.
LifeProTips,f2d0pjq,t3_dcpn5m,1570145243.0,Pretty sure just taking the paracetamol would work just as well if not better.
LifeProTips,f2d04us,t1_f29rdbn,1570145110.0,Yeah that's what the rest of the English speaking world calls it ... Don't know why Americans have to be special all the time.
LifeProTips,f2czssk,t1_f2cyn0m,1570145008.0,Ohhhh my bad ... All this time I've forgotten to not be poor.
LifeProTips,f2czqpr,t1_f2cex59,1570144980.0,Yeah but surely you could use family as babysitters. Family are not good movers.
AmItheAsshole,f1upv24,t1_f1u68h0,1569761981.0,No I don't think so ... Seems pretty accurate.
TooAfraidToAsk,f1m5luj,t3_d9xhzu,1569584988.0,I have a question ... is it like this for all memories or just memories in the same vein as “your ex used to beat you”. Because if its just memories of that nature/the associated memories - that could be a symptom of PTSD.
HumansBeingBros,f1lu8jp,t1_f1lu24f,1569569249.0,Yeah actually I work as a nurse fucking keeping people alive you self obsessed douchebag. I just don’t think that a persons worth is tied to how much money they make. And you’ve actually been a great example of that so thanks.
HumansBeingBros,f1lt9p6,t1_f1lstie,1569567777.0,Wow you are absolute garbage.
AmItheAsshole,f1b5co8,t1_f1b4jv6,1569324315.0,What part of Australia? In NSW it costs around $500 unless you have a health care card.
AmItheAsshole,f1ayero,t1_f1ak19j,1569314103.0,What about if your SO had severe pet allergies ? Still a deal breaker?
IllegalLifeProTips,f1axta9,t1_f1axrzw,1569313109.0,Well sure if that’s your philosophy then by all means go for it
IllegalLifeProTips,f1awspu,t1_f18weha,1569311413.0,Yeah definitely don’t do this ... they don’t let you do it every few days for a reason ... you need your plasma bro.
AmItheAsshole,f1au363,t1_f1ahq0j,1569307325.0,Agreed! I get 6 weeks vacation + 10 days sick leave. What is this 10 days PTO garbage?
AmItheAsshole,f0ykbbi,t1_f0yedqr,1569072139.0,Why did you have fish if you don’t like them?
AmItheAsshole,f0xle4a,t1_f0x1s7d,1569036539.0,"All of this does not justify abusing - emotionally or physically - your partner. Testosterone levels vary naturally across the population, that doesn’t mean that men with naturally higher testosterone will automatically abuse their partners, or that men with lower testosterone automatically never will."
AmItheAsshole,f0xifry,t1_f0x9nog,1569033696.0,“Dear husband” because you can’t just type husband for some reason
AskReddit,f0vzuoc,t1_f0vzoj7,1568995747.0,Sure absolutely ... and what about the 24+ hours bacteria have had to multiply at room temp? By your logic why clean a pan ever unless you’re using a particularly sticky or flavourful sauce.
AskReddit,f0vyf0j,t1_f0vxb53,1568994776.0,If you were just cooking oil for some reason I’d agree ... but you remember the meat that was on that pan right?
AskReddit,f0vwsqs,t1_f0v0alp,1568993680.0,Was the dog ok? Do I want to know?

Cooking,f0jo83q,t1_f0a6kkg,1568658972.0,Agreed! Is she trying to poison you all??
AmItheAsshole,f0eb3k0,t1_f0dnwos,1568565694.0,So glad to find that link doesn’t go anywhere. Yikes.
Workinmoms,ezxo6tg,t1_ez75044,1568245365.0,Yeah there’s a reason young children/teens are usually not diagnosed with mental illnesses ... Personality traits that would indicate a mental disorder in an adult are not necessarily set in children for one.
