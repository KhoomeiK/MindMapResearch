Your missing pointed tweezers, an asthma inhaler, an epipen, ziplocks, and some form of sanitizer that can be poured on btw. 

Splits can be made out of just about anything hard and long if you have enough tape (duct tape always works best for me). 

I didn’t know the gauze + ace bandage thing had a name. I just have the gauze and a velcro ace bandage. TIL. 

Please tell me more about this clotting gauze. If it isn’t horribly expensive (and I carry around off brand epipens so you know my idea of horribly expensive) I would like to carry this either too or as a better product than I currently have. 

CPR masks are kinda useless for me since statistically stopping chest compressions for breathing is only good for EMTs. If I’m in a position to be giving chest compressions, I’m a stopgap for an EMT, and studies state it’s slightly more useful for me to not stop for the breaths. 

Btw I’m what happens when a CPR/first aid trained Girl Scout is raised by a prepper army veteran. On the bright side I’ve never had to use the actual packing gauze or the tourniquet, everything else I have.

Now that I’m disabled I have a service dog. Stealing him, taking him away from me, or stopping him from preforming his tasks, are all major crimes, because he is legally medical equipment for a disabled person.

If a similar situation ever happens again, which I hope doesn’t but as a service dog owner my expectations aren’t high based on the crap I have to deal with, you should press charges of your own. You shouldn’t just let the store handle it. People should learn, and sometimes the hard way, treating disabled people like that is wrong. 

I read somewhere that blind people are the group that is least likely to press charges when something happens. You shouldn’t be one of the statistics.
