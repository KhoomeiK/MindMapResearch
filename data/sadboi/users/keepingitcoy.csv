Just totally glossing over the fact that a white dude is telling his black friend

The last paragraph states that your brain can still be shaped and molded and the effects are not permanent. 

In order to rewire your brain, you can develop habits that create new neural paths in your brain. Your brain will want to take the fastest and easiest path from point A to B, but you can create a new path (habits) that your brain will opt to take instead. But because the new path isn't as well paved, your brain will want to take the easier route and try to revert to the old path. As long as you remain diligent and notice the habitual way you revert to old thought processes, you can train your brain to use the new neural path until it becomes the most paved path."

I used to be a bully and still enjoy belittling others if I feel they deserve it, this is where it usually gets tricky because everyone's definition of what is right or wrong is subjective. You can act like you're a mild mannered person and still have the thoughts you typically have in those encounters but this way you won't be a disturbance to others or cause any unneeded drama which takes away time from something more productive to your well being. 

It definitely takes more energy acting within the confines of what society deems acceptable but i found that you can generally have a better outcome being a slightly above average mannered person, more so than if you opted to just do something that would be a negative outcome for them but a positive one for you. Also the chances of having a negative backlash or causing a situation that would place yourself in a much worse position are significantly lowered.

ADHD,f8vkuz9,t3_e2fqb7,1574871728.0,"> Can this change? How do I get him to actually look at what he is doing? He won't listen to me about it. He listens to counselors when we are in front of them but hasn't internalized their messages to remember them across time. He doesn't see how destructive he's acting. He's ready to separate too because he thinks I thrive on negativity. He's totally missing the cause and effect of his own actions.

Whenever you two get into a conflict are you the one always conceding or has there been times when he has conceded to you and changed his behaviour? 

It's one thing to consider separating on your end due to his inability to change, but for him to gaslight you into thinking this is a ""you"" problem and that he is ready to throw in the towel because of your negativity leads me to believe that most of your conflicts end up with you conceding by either dropping it and not addressing it further or just trying to work around it and believing this is just the way things are.

ADHD is very difficult to manage but it doesn't blind you on how your actions are affecting others. I'm well aware on how my actions affect others and if I'm negatively impacting myself or others then that's reason enough to try to find an alternative action.

https://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/gettindempecs?date=2017-05-12

There's an example of me falling off the wagon and binge eating but I still logged the calories because I wanted to hold myself accountable. Every month I lost 10lbs but that's nothing at 400, yet I still persevered because I wanted to make a change in my life. by August 2017 I lost 60lbs and was finally starting to feel a little happy about my weight loss but I was still very much struggling to stay consistent.

I stopped focusing on losing weight during May 2019 after reaching 240lbs. Now I'm more focused on being healthy and active because walking for 10 mins no longer feels horrible. Currently I'm 230 and mostly focusing on losing body fat and building muscle.

I struggled with weight all my life but IF was really the only thing that worked. The awesome thing about it is I pretty much ate mostly the same stuff and still only eat huge portions (huge ass bowl of vermicelli + sriracha sauce mixed with veggies, and some protein on the side. Usually it was a microwaved burrito or a nice slice of ham cooked on a george foreman) because I just can't eat small portions and failed every time I tried to. I had to feel like I ate a good meal or otherwise I would end up snacking later. The trick I did was to just cook a lot of stuff that was low in calories and was still filling (vermicelli).

I could have lost weight faster if I exercised and lowered my calorie intake but f that, I would much prefer losing weight slowly and comfortably rather than forcing myself to go through a routine that would make me want to quit after a week.
