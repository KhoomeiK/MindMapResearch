When i was 18 I was in a similar predicament with money and my mother and I weren't on good terms. All I can say is just keeping going. Being bipolar you know that this low won't be that low forever. You can take one thing at a time and slowly start to build yourself back up until you wake up one morning and you are content with where you have brought yourself. As for now, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, is a good quote I repeat to myself when I'm so low I'm considering. I don't know you personally but you sound like a lovely person who has a lot to offer. 

I sincerely hope your day has gotten better and I really hope reading all the nice things that everyone on here has to say helps lift your spirits a little bit."

You do you girl. Also rape is never justified, that fact that anyone would ever fucking say that just screams ignorance. Try to just tune them out, when people make comments like that it usually is out of jealousy."
