The pro is I have experience in stopping with high dosages of benzos. But the time restraint I have makes it impossible and the pressure so much higher which only gives me more anxiety.

I have a treatment that was postponed due to corona, got benzos to survive it to that treatment. And now the clinic is suddenly opening. I've waited for over a year to get into this clinic. Damn. I'm gonna have to wait even longer.

They're gonna discuss my benzo use next week. Let's hope they go easy on me lol."
