AskOldPeople,fqo7r8e,t3_gjwgf3,1589509310.0,"I'm in the UK and I can only speak for what it was like here.

I remember the Hong Kong flu in 1968-69.  I caught it in 1968, and I have never ever been so ill as I was with that.  It really was bad.  But the country and the world just carried on as normal during Pandemics in those days.   Nothing changed, people still went to work and went to school and life carried on completely as normal.  There was no lock downs or changes of social behaviour.   People would catch it and be off work for maybe 3 or 4 weeks and then go back to work.    It was really only the very elderly that died, and they did not go into hospital, they just got sick at home and then sometimes it turned to pneumonia and then they died.  At that time there wasn't really any idea of shielding the vulnerable, because mostly there were not any vulnerable transplant patients or immuno suppressant patients because medical science had not advanced that far at that time, and also very few people had diabetes as there was not a weight problem back in those days.  And there wasn't much in the way of heart by pass surgery or things like that, so it meant that most of the population was naturally pretty healthy or had already died.  So it was only the very old that mainly died from it.    We didn't try to stop it, or make too much fuss about it really, we just kind of got on with it and with life in general.

My Mum caught the earlier flu 57-58 which was the Asian flu and she nearly died.   She was ill with the after effects for 8 months and I had to go and live with an Aunt as she was unable to look after us children during that 8 months.  But I'm a bit too young to remember much about that flu except that life went on pretty much as normal during it.   There certainly wasn't all the extreme measures that we are seeing today.   These things just swept through populations and did what they were going to do and then that was that, because in those days we didn't have any means of stopping them or altering it's course."

When you first smoke a cigarette, it is horrible and feels terrible, and you feel like you are choking and you don't understand why anyone would want to do it.  It's just a horrible sensation.

But then after smoking for a while, maybe a week or two, then the chemicals in the nicotine in the cigarette activate receptors in the brain and make it addictive so that you have to keep doing it.

And then it becomes nearly impossible to stop because it is so addictive.    I smoked for many years but gave up smoking 3 years ago, but still miss it and get cravings.
