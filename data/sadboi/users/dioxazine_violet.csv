I had to get my wisdom teeth out ~11 years ago when I was on Suboxone for the first time. I was on 8mg daily.

It was the actual worst.

I had to get it done in hospital under general anaesthesia, while intubated. The anaesthesiologist explained that they'd have to use carfentanil for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, which also made it necessary that I be intubated. 

After surgery, obviously, I didn't get anything for pain relief. Got all four wisdom teeth out and then got dry socket on both sides on the bottom. Couldn't eat solid food for a month. 

The worst part of it all was how they treated me. I was a terrified little 19 year old, and I received no compassion or even kindness from anyone who was involved in my care.

Meal replacement drinks, high calorie ones, are a good place to start. Also, avoiding foods that are absorbent or chunky because those are the easiest way to choke on vomit.

He had worse than I did. He didn‚Äôt walk around the possibility of physical withdrawals. Eventually he went overboard too, and he swore never to sell it and I swore to never ask for it. Not for me, but because I didn‚Äôt want him to be out in a position of temptation. When I got out of the hospital he was the only one looking out for me and making sure I was straight. Not snake-plug shit like trying to get me spend more money on product. 

He would spot me extra bars when I came to pick up, and let me try morphines to see if it would minimize the cravings a little bit. Any pills I tried never worked. I bought 4 x 30mg morphine, and 3 x 15mg morphine extended release, one 15mg morphine sulphate IR, and two x 5mg oxycodone. I took every pill within 2 to three hours and even tried to crush some of the extended release, and never felt a thing: zero effects, good or bad. It would take five 30s to get me somewhere, and that wasn‚Äôt something I could afford. 

For a while I messed with coke on the weekends and still had fun with the party drugs, but my mind was still defaulted to heroin. At any stressful moment, my mind would subconsciously submit heroin as the solution to my problems. It was the same exact thought every time; ‚ÄúI wish I had some heroin‚Äù. Even months later, I would have dreams of using and wake up with unbearable cravings and an aching stomach. 

When I became comfortable with online sales, every month or two, I‚Äôd get a gram of one of the only #4 listings. 10,000+ sales Grey dragon last I bought. It‚Äôs like a king vacation, where I just kill a gram in three or four days, and then move on with my life. The way I react to it as a whole makes it feel like I‚Äôve been training with this substance to get somewhere that most people couldn‚Äôt imagine being while on dope. I haven‚Äôt puked on dope in months, maybe half a year. I‚Äôve started re-dosing once or twice after learning you could chase the rush, but the grams go quick now. My initial dose is up to the very dose that once almost killed me. I do a point to start, and re-dose 30mg to 50mg every hour or so. The rush and wave of warmth will never be present, or at least as strong as it once was, but it still makes me feel fine even when things around me obviously aren‚Äôt. I can eat meals on it without getting sick, and the taste hardly phases me. The effects are less sedating and now I want get up and be productive after enjoying the rush. Maybe tolerance or maybe what I used before was stronger or just cut more than I had originally thought. 

Either way, if it‚Äôs genuine or synthetic, it‚Äôs heroin and it‚Äôs a relationship that I have no real reason to end. I can keep the ins and outs and secrets to myself. If friends are persistent on trying it out of ignorance, confidence, or FOMO, I say okay. I give them no more than 30mg. One of them was sick the whole night and they didn‚Äôt get a rush or feel numb, and I didn‚Äôt tell them that was what it‚Äôs like because I may be shitty for even letting people try it, but I know what‚Äôs safe and I know that if I give them 30mg and keep them away from the edge they will just express their frustrations and mind boggling questions because how could anyone enjoy being sick or such a bitter taste. I just agree and say it‚Äôs not for everyone. 

Online, in person, or when people ask about recommending it or advice before using it, I tell them I couldn‚Äôt recommend it and there‚Äôs no point in taking it if you aren‚Äôt willing to risk your life to stand on the edge and feel the warm breeze that engulfs your body as you stand on the edge of a hole that is only a few milligrams away.

opiates,fi7673o,t1_fi763w0,1582215120.0,"
One weekend I was especially excited to use, but it was one of those days where I just couldn‚Äôt tough out the bitter drip and I held back the vomit maybe three or four times, but it wouldn‚Äôt give so I let loose in the bathroom sink. It didn‚Äôt even have a chance to kick in yet and I wasn‚Äôt feeling anything. A little vomit came out my nose so maybe some of it was wasted? So I re-dosed, a little less than 20mg, scaled out and everything. I waited, but didn‚Äôt notice anything, and I think I waited 30 to 45min. Then in all my infinite wisdom (and seemingly putting all my trust in this heavenly cure), I used the tip of a gift card and just put a little corners worth on the table. It didn‚Äôt look like much so I said, ‚Äúfuck it,‚Äù and I took it. 

My boy was on the couch on the same shit and he was just floating by, but what I was experiencing was different than what I was used to. The nodding onset was way faster and it wasn‚Äôt ordinary nodding; I was spacing out hard. I explained out loud that I was spacing so fucking hard and next thing I knew, I woke up in an ambulance with blurry vision, feeling crippling nausea, and with classic automatic frustration because my brain was pissed about being pulled away from that sweet warm coma. 

There was no dreaming between consciousness, and no pain prior to waking up. To this day I believe that is the perfect way to go if you were to have a choice in how it happens. I didn‚Äôt care about almost dying or possible damage to my lungs from inhaling vomit or how it may have effected me mentally. 

What killed me was hearing about my friend checking my eyes every 5 minutes for almost two hours to make sure they hadn‚Äôt rolled back in my skull, or my other friend who has no experience or interest in drugs coming over with a CPR booklet and a bible, praying over my body. The image of my grandmother coming home and seeing my friends trying to carry my lifeless body to the car and her calling my dad asking if I had any allergies. My dad knew exactly what was happening and the first thing he said to me after I woke up was that he would break my knees if I pulled that shit again. The frantic call I received from my mother because she found out through my aunt after my grandmother called her to pray for me. Me and my mother weren‚Äôt on the best terms, but I‚Äôm her youngest son and she had to find out from an outside party that I almost died from a heroin overdose. 

To me, the name has no light (???), it only entices cravings and dreams of being wrapped in never ending comfort. I refused rehab because I truthfully was not an addict. I did not use more than once every weekend, or even every other weekend. It was an irresponsible decision and I took it as a big lesson. When you dedicate yourself to a relationship with heroin, you‚Äôre trusting her with every single aspect of your life. I told everyone I was done with it. 

But, before I flushed it, close friends were acting strange and distant. When confronted, it was just an overload of assumptions; that I was still using and that I wasn‚Äôt going to stop, and that they were too young for that stress or that they weren‚Äôt comfortable being around the drugs. They never thought to ask me to give up the drugs for them or choose them or the drugs: they just decided my choice for me. I loved heroin, but I would‚Äôve flushed that gram if they had asked me. But‚Ä¶ the way they treated me like I was some junkie choosing drugs over his friends‚Ä¶ that hurt. 

After a while it made me frustrated that my closest friends weren‚Äôt willing to even talk it through. So, I thought, why should I stop if everyone around me was making the choice for me? And so I did the g. It lasted me and my boy maybe three weekends. We almost always used together, but I controlled the drug and knew his doses and gradually scaled his shit every couple months to keep up with tolerance. To this day, that motherfucker never puked, not once, on the dope even when he first started. I continued the same usage habits and at this point was when I really started seeing the true reason heroin was so amazing. 

It numbs everything. It doesn‚Äôt lie to you, like meth does, and makes everything feel like it‚Äôs going great. It tells you with all honesty everything is still just as fucked now as it was for you when you were sober, but when she wrapped her blanket around you, she blocked out any emotion or thought that would threaten a stable mood. I would be able to talk more with no insecurity. I could forget about school and all the work I held off. I could forget about having to go to work on Monday. I could analyze things without letting my emotions cloud my rational thinking. I recalled that I came out to all of my friends on shrooms about my use of one of (if not the) hardest life consuming drug on the street. They didn‚Äôt try to break off then. They didn‚Äôt even ask me to reconsider. Some just gave me shit and said they weren‚Äôt surprised, and others said they didn‚Äôt judge, but just didn‚Äôt understand it and I could respect that. 

In the end the only ones who stayed were the ones who used with me, or understood the position I was in, which at that time that was maybe 3 people. Then, one day I was talking with my plug, whom I‚Äôm close with and I‚Äôve gotten every substance I have tried from him. He was hooked on the H too, and he stopped selling it after I overdosed because it was synthetic and that was a lot of weight on him knowing his product caused that (even though it had nothing to do with it being synthetic... I jumped from my usual 60mg dose to 100mg+ dose). Eventually he just cut off opioids in general. Me and him were still on the food, though.

I started using Heroin early 2019; the first time I tried it was 30mg snorted, and it was #4. I was using dosage info that I had found after searching forever (because for some reason it was so hard to find info on using Heroin recreationally and if you asked any questions on subs like¬†r/drugs¬†it would be met with criticism and offended people tht couldn‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd put what you want in your body and had the nerve to ask for info to use it responsibly. The dosage info I found was for insufflation; never fucked with needles I‚Äôm not a medical professional) and went something like ‚Äúcommon 30mg, high 45mg or 50mg‚Äù, and ‚Äúheavy‚Äù was 60mg. 

Obviously I knew to stay away from the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù dose since my only other experience with opioids was two Percs I took on New Years while rolling. I did not get it at first. Like most people, I would assume. Luckily, it didn‚Äôt even make me sick the first time. It just didn‚Äôt feel like anything happened. The next day I decided to up it to around 45mg, and I could see a glimpse of it. It wasn‚Äôt quite as gripping as thought it‚Äôd be but I could feel that slight rush. I did around 50mg for my next few times and I always made sure to never use three days in a row. This lead to polydrug abuse because I would get high on other things in between to keep me distracted. When I started doing 60mg, I fell deeply in love with heroin. That love is forever imprinted on my brain, and no matter how long I go without using, it will never fade from my mind. 

I couldn‚Äôt move much after using and I could only sip water. I learned how to swallow water in a way that it‚Äôd catch the drip so I could try to avoid tasting it. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine eating and I vomited on average 4 to 6 times each session, but I wasn‚Äôt phased by it. I would go outside with my friends and we‚Äôd spread out on the street while smoking cigarettes, and during the entire initial rush I would just throw my head back and express my love for heroin; I loved it so much. I had control to give her some space, but I always missed her. I never used during the weeks because I couldn‚Äôt imagine performing at my construction-based job while on a drug that forces me to sit still for an hour or I‚Äôll just get sick and ruin the rush. I would use Sunday night, and always be sick the first half of work wondering if I was going to embarrass myself puking in front of the crew.

I guess, ostensibly with this law, everyone presenting with an ectopic pregnancy, regardless of gestational age, would require laparoscopy or laparotomy... And then what???

As far as what you can do at this point, I've got two recommendations. 

1. Get connected with mental health services. Do it in whatever way you need to; whether that's going to A&E or making an urgent appointment with your GP. Explain that you are currently experiencing extreme distress, and you need assistance as soon as possible. 

2. Play Tetris. There has been some (some!) research that suggests that playing Tetris can [""disrupt the formation of mental imagery involved in flashbacks""](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tetris-shown-to-lessen-ptsd-and-flashbacks/). Apparently this effect can be achieved by focusing on other highly engaging visual-spatial tasks, so if Tetris isn't your jam, perhaps another game could work as well. 

An optional and tricky third recommendation: there's been some evidence to suggest that using Propanolol (and perhaps other beta blockers?) has been beneficial as soon as immediately after a traumatic event. Something to look into, I guess.

You said you're a lorry driver; are you part of a union? If you have a union representative you could speak to about this, as it absolutely will affect your ability to work, that could be a good first step. If you don't have a union, do you have any kind of employee assistance plan?

Everything they've ever done since signing up has been recorded and stored, with respect to their use of medical or psychiatric services. That kind of data just isn't as easily accessible in civilian populations. They're also more likely than the average civilian to receive a diagnosis of PTSD in their lifetime. So, not only is there just more data about them, but there's more data about them having and living with PTSD. 

In my opinion, whether the information is about civilians or soldiers/veterans, I'm going to find it just as useful and be just as glad to have it.

Have you been having your HCG tracked to make sure that the shot worked?

I felt that after my ectopics, it was really hard to understand and interpret the pain and sensations in my pelvic area. I was never sure if I was feeling something normal that I'd just never noticed before, or if I was feeling something that actually indicated an issue. During and after my ectopics, I feel like I became super aware of every little sensation in my pelvic area. 

I know that I had pain and difficulty urinating when I was bleeding internally. I can't recall if I experienced it at any other point. I'm definitely not suggesting that you are bleeding internally. It could be anything; maybe there's some inflammation as your body is absorbing the pregnancy, maybe you've got a UTI, maybe it's just random pain. It's definitely frustrating and concerning. Hopefully you'll be able to get some answers at the ER, or at least be reassured if there's nothing wrong. Best of luck."

What do you feel like you would have to do for it to have been ""enough""? Would it have been enough to try more medicated cycles? Would it have been enough to do IUI? Would it have been enough to do IVF? Would it have been enough to use a surrogate? Would it ever have been enough, if you never walked away with a living child?

It's your inalienable right to decide what is enough for you. Just as it should be someone's right to decide when to move from active treatment to palliative treatment. You haven't come to this decision because you're, like, just not into it. You've come to this decision because it's what is legitimately most likely to lead to a better sustained quality of life for you and your partner. And there is absolutely no shame in that. 

You and your partner both are deserving of empathy and validation from your loved ones. I think your concerns about their reactions are totally justifiable; you don't have much reason to expect that they will react well. And they might not. People are very quick to judge. People are even quicker to judge women* on what they choose to do with their bodies. If they decide to throw a hissy fit because you're not doing what THEY want you to do with YOUR body, with YOUR life, that is not your fault. If they judge your suffering to be insufficient, shame on them.

I'd always made a habit of disclosing my substance use disorder, whether it was in remission or not. 

Once, after having been clean for years at that point, I went to the ER because I was pregnant, bleeding, and having right-sided pelvic pain. I am medically literate, not that that matters, and knew that what I was experiencing was the signs of an ectopic pregnancy. If you don't know what it is, look it up. It's the primary cause of maternal death in the first trimester.

Anyway, I see this doctor. He takes my history (which included opiate use disorder in remission). Pushes on my belly a bit. Takes his gloves off. Tells me that ""people with ectopic pregnancies don't look like you"", and sends me home.

24 hours later I was back, having emergency surgery, having bled 400cc internally. It was incredibly traumatic.

EctopicSupportGroup,f70lp9c,t3_dtsxpy,1573329836.0,"**You've just been through a traumatic medical emergency involving your reproductive system.** 

My last (and final) ectopic was in April of 2017. I still have a very, very, very hard time with my periods. As a result of my repeated pregnancy losses and other events in my life, I've been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Anything involving my reproductive system is triggering for me; ovulation pains, menstruating, pelvic exams, and so on. 

What you're experiencing is a completely justifiable reaction to the trauma that you've just been through. Please, be gentle with yourself. If your best friend was going through what you're going through right now, what would you say to them? You might tell them that you love them unconditionally, that you'll be there to support them through the difficulties to come, just like your partner is saying to you. 

You will make it to Tuesday, I promise. 

I also get very tired of being me, of being broken, of being so easily triggered by things that should just be a normal part of life. Medication and therapy have helped. If you were already suffering from mental health difficulties before the ectopic, it's totally not unreasonable that your anxiety might be worse afterwards. Ectopics are fucking scary. They are the number one cause of maternal death in the first trimester. They necessitate (sometimes emergency) surgery, and/or huge doses of toxic medication. That's enough to make anyone anxious. 

Allow your partner the privilege of supporting you through this tough time. He's also been through a loss, and it may be helpful for him to care for you. 

Also, if you're taking the Trintellex now, *do not stop taking it abruptly*. The last thing you need, on top of all this, is to experience discontinuation effects from your medication. Your physician may be able to prescribe you some rescue medication for anxiety, like Ativan (lorazepam) or Klonopin (clonazepam). 

I'm so sorry for your loss, and my heart aches knowing what you're going through now. You won't get over it, but you'll get through it.

OpiatesRecovery,f6xppap,t3_dtgwmx,1573255113.0,"Acetaminophen is safe for use in pregnancy, provided you're not exceeding 3-4g per day.

Also, 8mg of codeine is not a very high dosage. Surely, not using any opiates during pregnancy would be ideal, but life is hardly ever ideal. Opiates and opioids are not teratogenic (meaning they won't cause birth defects), and the main danger of opiate use during pregnancy, when overdose is NOT a concern, is withdrawal in the neonate (baby once their born). Codeine is generally considered safe for use in pregnancy. The safest course for you and your fetus is to continue using what you're using, until you are otherwise directed by a health professional.

ptsd,f485x62,t3_djp9xq,1571432993.0,"Journalling!!

I had been in therapy for years already and was always flummoxed when my therapist would ask me how I've been, how things were going, how I'm doing, and I would just blank. I couldn't remember how I'd been feeling, what I'd been doing, if something was bothering me. Eventually, I came around to the idea that I just have issues (in general) with encoding memories about my day-to-day experiences. I have no issues with remembering conversations, dates, appointments, tasks, or the litany of things that I have to remember for work. I'm just not good at remembering anything about... me. 

Over the last couple months, I've started doing something that's kind of similar to bullet journalling. Every week, I create a page in my journal on which I track all my important metrics: my moods (on a Likert scale, 1-5), how much I've slept and the quality of that night's sleep, how many meals I've eaten, which meaningful hobbies or behaviours I've engaged in, anywhere I've gone outside of work or home over the last week, and 3 words that describe my day. 

This has made it much simpler to tell my therapist how I've been doing. I can show them a single page that has captured a lot of detail about the past week. I can see this data for myself. And I am diligent about filling it out every day (only takes a few minutes). I also journal daily, throughout the day; I have my journal and pens with me everywhere I go. I timestamp each entry throughout the day. Sometimes it'll just be a few words, or a sentence or two. Sometimes I'll sit down and write a whole page at once. I have no expectations for my journaling, other than to catalogue my day-to-day existence so I can reflect on it later.

ptsd,f3d2lqo,t3_dgam0z,1570831100.0,"I use a couple things.

Number one, I read myself to sleep. I used to watch monotonous YouTube videos, like people playing Minecraft, but made the switch to reading a couple months ago. I read something that's not too heavy, not too interesting, but that keeps my mind occupied while I'm trying to fall asleep. I use Scribd and read grey text on a black background so it's not blasting blue light into my eyes while I'm trying to wind down. 

I make sure my room is cool, dark, and comforting. I have a fan going to keep the air circulating because
 I find I get anxious in stuffy rooms. 

I use a weighted blanket. Not sure if this helps or not, but it makes me feel kinda safe and nice.

Also, I shower at night. Your body should, if it's working properly, lower in temperature throughout the night. I help it along by taking a warm shower in the evening, having my body cooling before I get into bed.

I used to wear headphones to sleep, playing white noise that blocked out most sounds from my environment. Now I'm in a somewhat quieter place and I can use earplugs instead.

I have a fairly strict bedtime and a good nighttime ritual.

Also, it helps me to know that my sleeping environment is safe. Doors are locked. Phone is on do not disturb. Except for an actual emergency or something out of the ordinary, nothing should bother me. At least two alarms are set for the morning so I'm absolutely sure I won't sleep in and don't have to worry about it. Also, if I'm worried that I'm going to forget something important in the morning, I'll make sure to put a reminder somewhere so I can stop worrying about it.

If my thoughts are really swirling and it's getting close to bedtime, I'll journal and get them all down on paper. There, I know they'll be safely kept until I can get to them at a better time.

Worst case scenario, I'll count my breaths backwards from 100. Every time I get distracted, start over.

Medication has been immensely helpful for me in terms of reliably falling asleep. I saw you mention in the comments that meds aren't your thing, though. Hopefully you'll be able to find your perfect combination of things to help you feel safe when you're trying to rest.

Generally, no one wants to keep you in the hospital *any longer than is strictly necessary*. As soon as you're stable, you're better off at home than in the hospital. Less chance of secondary infections and other complications. So yes, it is normal to be sent home so quickly afterwards.

Turns out, in my experience, hearing disorders are *very* commonly comorbid with PTSD, especially in service members. Mainly hearing loss and tinnitus. HOWEVER, I have misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus, and I totally understand where you're coming from.

First off, those suggestions to use with your partner sound pretty good. In my experience, I've found that people can be kinda... sensitive about being told that they're making a noise that triggers you. Especially with eating noises. I just recently got out of an abusive relationship with a partner who would go out of his way to make disgusting mouth sounds while eating just to watch me recoil and gag. It was a great time. If your partner is being supportive, that's amazing. I just started dating someone who is very sweet about my hyperacusis, always asking if things are too loud, making sure that our date spots won't be too loud, being understanding when I need something turned down or I need to wear my earplugs, comforting me if I startle from a loud noise, etc. He's the best.

Your new therapist sounds like a keeper. I say this, because I also have a therapist who has been unfamiliar with some of my issues, but has always been willing to take her own time and look into them, in order to treat me better. If you've already developed a rapport with her, and you feel safe with her, honestly... keep her. 

In terms of a narrative of your childhood/traumas, this could certainly be difficult with large amnestic gaps. I have found that using [Internal Family Systems Therapy](https://www.selfleadership.org/about-internal-family-systems.html) has been the best for me, allowing me to construct a cohesive narrative of my inner experiences, and all the different ""parts"" of me that are holding different traumas.

You have been through something traumatic. Your life will never be the same. Your heart has been broken in a way that renders it tender and vulnerable to a lot of stimuli that you have no way of controlling. The physical pain of the situation does NOT AT ALL compare to the emotional pain that you are now, and will continue to, experience. 

Treat yourself. Get a tattoo, or several. Dye your hair. Cut your hair. Buy new clothes. Rearrange your furniture. Go on a vacation. Take up basketweaving. WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO, you should do it.

Now is *not* the time to be worried about being selfish. Examine where that feeling is coming from. Why are you interpreting your need for self-care as selfish, especially at a time when you've been through something so traumatic and destabilizing?

Wishing you all the best."

Pregnancy loss, especially this very scary and possibly lethal kind of pregnancy loss, is absolutely traumatic and can definitely lead to PTSD or other adjustment/trauma related disorders. It's serious shit. Don't let anyone ever make you feel that it's not. If you find yourself struggling in the coming days, months, years... Seek help. I have been forever changed by my losses. It's a very hard hole to crawl out of, but it's possible. 

As female bodied people, we are so conditioned to conflate our fertility with our identity. Just as surely as the sky is blue, women* should be able to bear children.

Oh, how we all wish it was that simple. 
DM me anytime if you need to talk or need help processing. Wishing all the best."

I wasn't given the option of trying to salvage the tube. Ruptured unexpectedly in my sleep.

If you never want this to happen again, lose the tube. Though there's a waiting list, you can get IVF funded provincially. Contact your local fertility centre or check their website and see what the current situation is.

If you're willing to take a chance on this happening again, through a planned pregnancy or an unplanned one, then try and salvage the tube. It may not be successful, but you'll know that you'd tried. 

Given how traumatic my ectopic pregnancies were, the only thing I was relieved about when it was over was that it could never happen again. 

Wishing you all the best and more."
