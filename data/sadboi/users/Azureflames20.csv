I don't think our different opinions are wrong though. Unlike a lot of other people's posts, you do at least discretely say that it's *your opinion* as opposed to concrete fact. While DW isn't their best album, I definitely don't find it to be their worst.

My, non-objective personal ranking for what I enjoy:

So Wrong It's Right > Wake Up Sunshine / NP  > Dirty Work / Don't Panic > LYR / FH

While you said No Idea and My Only One were ""easily some of the worst ATL tracks"", those are actually some of the songs on the album that I really liked. I also really like Too much off NP, which I wanna say a lot of people weren't into. 

What I like isn't what everyone else likes though; For example, I Personally like DW quite a bit over Future Hearts. Side-A on FH is great, but literally every song after cinderblock garden doesn't do a single thing for me. I think I only really like 5/13 tracks on FH while on DW I counted 12/16 tracks. I think DW just stays consistent to: if you like the style/vibe, you'll like most of the tracks, but if you don't you'll probably not like most of the album.

While I think Don't Panic's a really important and great album, I also rarely if ever find myself wanting to go back and listen to any of those tracks...and I listened to the crap outa that album when it came out.

Idk, music subjectivity is weird."
TheValleyFolk,fr5l4yf,t3_gmswuh,1589910349.0,"Honestly it would've gone into one of two ways...

1. They'd have stayed together and slowly fizzled out, dealing the stress, anxieties, and whatever else was the problem. This would have reflected in their content and mental health eventually and at some point could've even resulted in disbandment or one or more not wanting to be a part of it anymore due to burnout
2. The other way I see is what happened. They separated from their problem and sought their own path despite it being the hard one.

I know some would like to insinuate through a post like this OP, that if they didn't go on Bring the funny that Lee would still be around and that they'd all be happy but that's not the case. Sure, maybe Lee would be around (maybe? It's impossible to say what they would've done) but the problems they'd been having were behind the scenes and weren't new

If anything, Bring the funny acted as a catalyst that sped up the process and made them realize that the stresses were even more apparent under stressful situations like the show put on them. It's likely not a coincidence that bring the funny may have brought upon a tipping point for the boys and Lee.. What happened was very likely bound to happen eventually.

EDIT: Feels silly seeing downvotes. I'm sure I should've just stucked to ""it's just not worth talking about because the past is the past"", but I honestly feel that since they mentioned it had been an ongoing behind the scenes problem that it could've gone in a similar direction no matter if they were doing BTF or not. I loved them together and was a fan of all of theirs since 2012, but people are people and sometimes things just don't work out how you think they will. BTF likely just solidified their positions on the matter, which ultimately led to their decision."

(sorry for a related personal rant...)

It's conversations with people like that that drives me nuts. My dad for whatever reason is like a *certain* *network* on viewpoints when it comes to everything going on and I can't stand it. F-news is literally always on in my parents house and he somehow tries to transition every topic of conversation into something involving his view on politics even when no one clearly wants to talk about it. It's been a huge wedge in my view of him as a person and our relationship. 

Whenever I've tried to challenge him on opinions he just disregards them, talks in circles without listening to me because he thinks I just disagree because I don't understand what he's saying (as if i'll just agree with him by default), then when I try to elaborate that I really don't agree with his viewpoints and criticize his view point he just goes on to tell me ""You're still just forming your ideas on things. I get it, i was young too. You Uncle was the same way; Just give it time and you'll understand and see things how I see them"". 

I'm also 29 years old btw...I think I'm certainly capable of listening and forming rational & educated opinions with everything going on. (Really sucks...'cause I was on the brink of being able to move out, but my new job laid me off due to covid so I can't afford to)

When it all started he would only go on and on about how it's not even bad ...that the only thing matters is just going to be like the flu in terms of the death percent and it'll be less than 1%, that people were exaggerating. He also very much said that the economy was his concern and that he'd be gladly sacrifice himself if it meant the economy would be fine. I already know he doesn't give a crap about people around him. He basically claims he only cares about his family and his household. 

 I feel like I should just give up on people like this and stop wasting my breath. It sucks 'cause it's my dad though; I just wish I could have a father who I could be proud of or at the very least...have good and healthy, positive conversation with."

People will discredit the idea of 1.3% death rate(which iirc is the current believed rate) and how many people’s lives that could be. Imagine the idea of wiping out the entire population of the city of Chicago(~2.7M), because that number plus more would be the number of total deaths if everyone in the US was infected. 1% is  just over 3M. the people claiming it’s just a flu should also realize that influenza rate is only 0.1% in comparison.

We're already on this train and there's no stopping it at this point.

The time to ***save*** the economy was back in the hands of the US administration back in January, February, and March. We've already barred ourselves all into having to play the slow-burn-long game to get to the end. It's too late now.

Trying to desperately save the economy is forcing the working class to risk infection for a paycheck so they can survive and eat. It's relying on everybody else to also just go out and buy shit in stores like its nbd. Not everybody will *just* get to have their jobs back either when the state snaps their fingers because some industries are dependent on global circumstances like Engineers/software developers/testers in Aerospace companies.

While there's certainly a subset of stupid people showing they don't care about getting sick or getting others sick, I think the vast majority of people are going to be very very uncomfortable going out to do anything like casually shopping in malls or going to their typical clothing stores like they used to.

Ultimately though, we're all going to be pretty bunkered down until very significant drops in cases, which doesn't leave us immune to multiple waves in the future.

summonerschool,fqepecl,t3_gi9tsh,1589311405.0,"In any game I believe there's a certain point where only champion experience will just keep you at a ceiling. A lot of people at lower levels of gaming always like to think that it's the mechanics that's holding them back...so they just grind game after game, but there's much more that goes into *getting better*. 

Things to consider...do you know your damage to a ""T"" at your early levels? Do you have perfect map and game awareness at all key points in the game? Are you efficiently trading in lane the way you need to be? Do you know how to bait for your jungle to gank? do you capitalize on lanes you win and gank for your teammates? do you facilitate good plays that get objectives?

I think a natural progression in league is that the lower you are, the less that people have a clue on playing safe, trading correctly, and knowing when to all in when in 1v1 lanes. It requires knowing your damage really well and understanding bait, punish, and how to play the specific matchup. You playing lower levels just exacerbates the ability to capitalize on your opponent early game. A lot of the reliable ways people get kills in lane isn't really from straight 1v1'ing...maybe in soloQ where people are bad, but if you get kills easy in lane, it doesn't always say that you're a great player...just that your opponent was bad. 

Success doesn't come from being able to do flashy everything and just fuck people up 1v1. It's more telling to me that you're a good player if you have skills that reflect good wave control,  good trades, you can react well to jungle ganks so that when you *do* get that kill, and you can snowball by winning your lane...ganking the other lanes...or getting objectives for your team.

Also, you said you have a 62% win rate? When it comes to statistics in games that I see, most people should consider that really really good in general. I think when it comes down to it, you might just have toxic expectations for yourself. There's more ways to win games than trying to get like 5/0 in lane before the 10 minute mark or some shit. ***Being good*** depends on so many factors that include subtlety in game awareness and experience over physical character mechanics. 

I guess I'm just confused on what your goal is here? You sound like you're doing great and on the right path? Being a crazy hypercarry every game to your expectations sounds unfeasible and unrealistic honestly, so what makes you think that's just how the game should be?"

The time it’d take to actually have change and reform occur would simply just take too long to give struggling people any real relief from the situation. Most people supposedly struggle to manage a $500 surprise expense/bill in their lives. We got $1200 that I’m sure some people STILL haven’t received and a lot of people struggle to think we’re getting anymore money in that regard with the current situation.

Even if change were to be instilled in everyone, how long do you think it’d go on for? Especially with the pushback from the people on power.

My comment was directed at the literal act of going outside, which is a response to you saying ""People need to get out of the house"". People *can* get out of the house if they're getting a little stir-crazy, since it's also getting warmer out for more areas of the US.

If you're referring to opening anything in terms of large scale recreation, I personally don't really see how that's a smart idea, nor do I see effective means of social distancing because things like going to the mall, going to the movies, playing contact sports, going to concerts, or going to sporting events just don't make the cut in that regard. There's no way of securing sanitation nor enforcing social distancing. It just doesn't seem reliable if you truly are keeping the health of other people first.

Big problem I see is that there's too many skeptics and people not giving a fuck to rely on people to self-police it and rely on that to keep numbers down. Masks help, but only if everybody is on-board. 

It *could* be a matter of the end of june...or the end of summer...or 6 months from now... or even 8mo-12mo from now. I'm not an expert and you shouldn't try to be one either in that regard. You say it's perfectly fine for business to start opening up, but you don't know. 

I don't have an answer on when it's fine, because the endgoal for us all seems fucked in everything anyway when we all break it down. No one has a fool-proof solution on what will work and either way you look at it either a lot of lives are going to be lost or **even more** lives are going to be lost. 

Again, idfk what people should do because the people that want to go back to work just want to be able to have money to eat, while the people that don't want to go back are afraid of fucking dying, which is also entirely understandable. Meanwhile the government doesn't give a fuck and will accept the small fries being martyrs for the $$$$$ at the end of the day.

It's all at the mercy of capitalism and encouraging people to push going to work, risking their lives.

AskReddit,fq16tnk,t3_gg63my,1589042552.0,"For me it's this overarching period of college and the following couple years after. In general it's just a story of developing insecurities into anxiety, depression, and letting myself spiral mentally and socially

Going into college I was very much a person who was indecisive and didn't know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life (most of the time, who the fuck *does*).

But yeah, I went into the pre-med route for classes when it was a subject that didn't come to me very well. In terms of mental capacity for memorizing and habits I was typically a C+ to B+ student at best, especially in that field. School life and studying became a huge burden on my anxiety and stress because I'd set high expectations for myself and fail those expectations in almost every class over and over even when i tried my hardest; Typically these classes were just 4 exams and a Final for the whole semester. Some had quizzes and a handful of them had lab classes that were entirely separate from the main class...So there was a lot of pressure to do well on the exams. Basically if you got a C on an exam you were basically fucked if you wanted a decent grade.

It got to the point where I'd avoid hanging out with people or wanting to go out and do *anything* with anyone for fear that if i didn't spend the weekend studying for tests that I'd become a huge failure.

Basically I'd spend most of my time escaping to play video games like starcraft and League of legends (which was also a really toxic environment for me tbh), or I'd hang with my girlfriend, or i'd be studying for a test.

I'd often be pretty pissy and lash out at the people close to me who didn't really know or understand and I'd also be a really big downer to the people around me if I was dragged around to a party that i said i didn't wanna go to. I was pretty self aware about it, but my emotions kept it too hard to keep it in check, so i got really depressed and anxious about my affect on other people socially on top of the expectations on myself to do well in school. Even though people probably didn't think anything of it, I'd constantly put it in my head that I was a loser, a failure, and that I was lame to my friendgroup because I'd constantly be bailing. It was an insanely toxic situation for myself.

It doesn't end there though, because during one of the early peaks of this I met this girl in one of my classes that I thought was really cute. Despite having this long-time girlfriend, I got pretty close to this girl in my class and started catching feelings. I told myself I wasn't pursuing anything physical because I still loved my girlfriend and i could never do that to anybody.

In my life at the time, this girl was one of the only things that was an escape from the anxiety, because she was in my major so she could relate to all the classes. Before I knew It I was stuck in a place where I was essentially emotionally cheating on my girlfriend. Even though I was eventually confronted about this with my girlfriend, I couldn't just let her go because she was also one of the only friends that i'd made myself during college (I'm a bit of an introvert and had a decent amount of friends go to the same college from my highschool friend group).

The duration of college was a long slowburn of trying to let this emotional fling fizzle out, despite us both off and on telling each other we still had feelings for each other. I had this long slowburn depression that went alongside it where I everything was just an uphill climb and I was miserable whenever I wasn't burying my head in some sort of escape. Eventually I graduated with a mediocre GPA, no plan for my next step, lingering feelings for this other girl, and anxiety and depression that I was still trying to figure out.

The next phase was difficult, but looked a lot more positive overall. After spiraling for awhile my girlfriend convinced me to switch majors to computer science, which fit me much more. I went back to school and got a job as a grocery stocker. The hard part of this really was more about being stuck in a ""purgatory"" where I couldn't move on and all the other people my age were moving on to careers, buying places to live, and/or getting married. I was put behind maybe 3 1/2 years to where I got burned out after graduation (at least I did better academically) and took too much time off so the process of applying to jobs felt like a lot. I didn't land a job in my field until the start of this year in January, which took me almost 2 years after graduation to get. I then got put on furlough in March, followed by getting laid off last week all due to the COVID-19 pandemic...so that's fun.

Overall though...everything really just came from a place of insecurity in myself, my lack of confidence in being proactive about life choices, and some of it being hard-headed and not admitting when I need to call it quits and get help or switch up something that's just not working for me in life."

Cloud is pretty level headed and knows what to say when it comes to everything fighting or being cool in that regard, but not when it comes to talking with people.

He had no clue how to navigate Jessie interactions and even gets thrown off by the forward ness of aerith at times. He’s awkward with kids at first and comes off scary to Marlene in the bar. Cloud takes a note from Barret when he hugs tifa after the plate collapse cause he literally didn’t have that social cue; I’m referring to the night sequence if you had tifa over aerith/barret for the midnight cutscene.

In that night sequence I mentioned, he doesn’t know what to do and has nothing to say when Tifa breaks down. All he can think of is to do what barret did cause that’s what he saw and even then, he was squeezing her too tight.

The vast majority of shoppers and stores open on black friday aren't the stereotypical ""riots rushing the shelves and fighting each other for flat screen tv's in the aisles"", especially nowadays with a lot of stores extending sales through the weekend. 

There's obviously a push and pull between consumers and retailers. If a store decides not to open, other competitors that do open will get their business; On the flipside, if businesses didn't provide the sales for manipulative marketing on those days then people wouldn't need to show up. They show up because the businesses set it up that way.

Even in vague senses it should be enough.

For me there's only 2 tracks I'd maybe skip on shapeshifter with those being 7-8/10's and I'd probably skip like 4-5 on copacetic with those ranging from 6.5-8/10's.  I vastly like the vocals and overall dynamics/ writing with shapeshifter because you get a lot of variation in style and energy/vibes. outside of a couple songs that are *lighter* compared the to the rest of the album, copacetic really stays on one level of dynamics - loud and raw.

 The numbers obviously changed by now, but even last week or the week before I read that we only had like < 1% of the population infected with the virus and Herd immunity can start at 40% but typically would need 80-95% immunity in the population to really see effects of it.

If we were to wait *that* long, I wouldn't doubt that we would be seeing catastrophic numbers of deaths in the overall population. We'd be better off waiting for a vaccine, even if it takes over a year (Not that really have a choice at this point)."

I hope despite this they still keep all the big main story beats and keep it incredibly close to “destiny”"
FinalFantasy,fnrniw5,t1_fnrmgmr,1587194770.0,"Yeah...I had a back and forth for quite a while today with a guy who is so heavily convinced at this point they’re not going to kill aerith, they’re resurrecting Zack to aid in the story plot, and Jenova will be more of a big bad than Sephiroth. Also, he wants to see Sephiroth have a redemption arc. He also made the claim that if they kept it in line with the story and didn’t make the addition of the whispers and Sephiroth fight that the remake “would’ve been forgettable”. 

I ended up talking in circles trying to explain the dynamics of the characters while explaining through important Jenova/Sephiroth lore from the OG that he just wasn’t understanding. 

I think if they go crazy and stray that far off the path of the OG Game, that they’d be doing a disservice to the story. I don’t want a shot for shot game like I alluded to when I said I liked so so many of the additions to the remake already. I just hope to God that they hold the main story elements together, true, and stay consistent enough to not fuck everything and then create a dumpster fire of a divide for the OG fans. 

Literally all they needed to do was not have anything about whispers being a convoluted “defeat fate-god” plot device. I honestly would’ve been alright with some showdown with Sephiroth, even if unnecessary. At least that could be worked into the original telling and slide through, but now we’re forced to view the whole next parts of the story through the lens of our party being “fate-defiers” and possible meta messages from the devs telling us they’re gonna completely change events and to not expect the things that happened in the OG because they were “things that will come to happen if they fail to defeat fate”. 

Ugh...I hope that’s all wrong and it’ll all be okay for the next games"
FinalFantasy,fnqoz55,t1_fnqntla,1587169067.0,"Sephiroth is a regular human, born of Lucrecia and Hojo. He was injected with Jenova's cells while in the womb with Lucrecia and absorbed Jenova's cells cleanly. If anything, Sephiroth is a reborn version of Jenova and obtained power because of those Jenova cells.

Neither Sephiroth nor Jenova are related to the Cetra at all. Jenova is an alien-being that crash landed on earth during the time of the cetra. You can view Jenova as an enemy of the Cetra.

Aerith is the last Cetra, born of Ifalna and Dr. Gast.

I think it appears that Jenova had influence on Sephiroth because they had similar overarching missions. That's not coincidence and in a pseudo-way it's definitely related. Instead of thinking of it as ""the creature jenova is hivemind influencing Sephiroth to do things"", it's more that ""Sephiroth is like Jenova reincarnate and is following his own will - Sephiroth and Jenova are one, but separate; Sephiroth is doing this on his own will as almost attaining a birthright to his existence""."
FinalFantasy,fnqlseh,t1_fnqi0l5,1587167183.0,"Hojo injected the cells of Jenova into Lucrecia (Sephiroth's real mother) and thus bonded him and Jenova. In the search for the promised land, hojo and gast wanted to attain the ability to speak with the planet so they experiemented with Jenova's cells. Typical people injected with Jenova cells would suffer effects and early death, but Hojo wanted to create or attain having a being that could talk to the planet (since they thought Jenova was a cetra, but were mistaken). Sephiroth absorbed Jenova's cells in the womb and even felt he was something different at a young age. he never obtained the ability to speak with the planet. 

Jenova didn't transform him into a monster. In fact, i believe that *because* he absorbed her cells in the womb, he was immune to that happening to him like the others. Instead he just had immense power *because* of jenova. 

He wasn't ""corrupted"" by Jenova or her willpower or whatever. It wasn't overnight necessarily either. He simply found out the truth of his birth; that he was the product of a shinra experiment to create a super soldier, just like the failed experiments in the pods at the nibelheim reactor. It took course over several days from that point and drove himself mad over his discoveries of the truth and *what* he really was.

His motivation is that he is the last surviving Cetra, born as Jenovas ""son, and that the human race betrayed the Cetra 2,000 years ago. His whole goal is vengeance for his ancestors at this point. His willpower was even enough to not be absorbed by the lifestream and even managed to navigate it to gain knowledge/power of the earth.

Sephiroth is the true mastermind and isn't influenced by Jenova as an overmind. If anything believe that Sephiroth has effectively become a new version of what jenova was. 

&#x200B;

> I think Sephiroth's story is tragic, and he is a very powerful person corrupted into a tool of Jenova, whether she's alive and active or dead. This may be setting up for his redemption, and a united effort to rid the world of Jenova once and for all. 

To me none of this lines up with the character we've already established as Sephiroth, even from the OG. He wasn't corrupted *by* Jenova. If anything Shinra 'creating"" sephiroth alone was the biggest catalyst in it all. jenova only gave him power and the ability to be what he was. She wasn't ""controlling"" him like you imply in your post. 

Also, in the original game YOU and your party literally eliminate the last bit of Jenova in the final segment of the OG game(Jenova-SYNTHESIS). You already rid the world of Jenova. 

Why in the world would ""redeeming"" sephiroth's character be a thing that should happen? You say it's a tragic story for him, but the only thing tragic was that he was created out of an experiment. Everything from  nibelheim and beyond was of his on will and fruitiion. He aspired to become a god because he learned about what Jenova was able to do."
FinalFantasy,fnqhlll,t1_fnqg1le,1587164768.0,"well..at this point there's nothing that can really be refuted, seeing as we just have different takes, beliefs and expectations for what we want to see in the next iterations of the remake. I know I personally won't like major storylines changing and i'll feel sour, since I personally don't see a big beneficial reason to changing that level of key story elements. To me its easily a case of ""...but really though, why fix something that's not even a little broken?"". my philosophy will always align more with ""leave all the big story beats alone and hold true, but minor story beats and expanding on the world shoot for the sky - go all out"".

I think Zack still could've been ambushed as they were approaching that cliffside, as even watching the crisiscore scene back, it leaves room for that to happen still. Cloud's whole identity in FF7 for most the game revolves around him believing he's who Zack was. He takes on the role of Zack. If Zack doesn't die, it fucks up every means of why Cloud even believes he's a SOLDIER 1st class to begin with. This is why I hate the idea of changing major plot points to the story line. You start changing things like that and it can greatly affect key attributes or character/story development moments in the overarching story context.

I suppose we'll have to wait and see  what they'll do.

&#x200B;

> I think the problem is more expectation than the game itself. Leaving the game as an HD retelling of the original would've ultimately been forgettable. 

Out of everything you've said in this thread, the idea of an HD retelling of the original story ***ultimately being forgettable*** is the most insane notion I've ever heard. In no way would that be an forgettable experience if you had the game we all just got but following the story points. To each their own i suppose?"
legendofdragoon,fnqg7it,t3_g3bi1j,1587163973.0,"I personally *could* see how they could manage the change in a similar action RPG style. In the way that FF7r handled abilities, you could have a similar gauge you build up to and once you fill gauge you can use an addition. It'd be action oriented until you got the addition, then once you use the addition it would lock into what would feel more like a classic feel, timing your input of the attacks to complete the move. using an addition is your means of building up spirit for your dragoon like in the OG.

I'm sure most purists absolutely hate the idea, but I could see it being a fun mechanic to play and I loved the original back in my playthroughs. Unfortunately, in reality I don't see a shot for shot style being made, in the same light that FF7 wasn't about to just do turn based combat like they did in the original. It'd have to be a hybrid of additions like the classic with some sort of real time feel involved imo."
FinalFantasy,fnqew4a,t1_fnq79yb,1587163245.0,">I agree. Though I'm interested in whether they could have improved the new storyline by leaving Barrett dead and skipping the destiny bit entirely. Everything's going the way you expect and then WHAM, one of your other friends is dead, and he's not supposed to be. But I think they wanted the explicit metaphor (and complicity) of the player in destroying destiny in the world and changing the course of the story.

I think it'd be an insane misstep to leave barret dead as a new twist to the remake.

>I agree, I don't think it was necessary, but it's a trope for JRPGs and they stuck to the formula. That we're not actually fighting the endgame bosses is in part because things are going to change and we probably never will, and to reinforce the metaphor. I suspect it may be fanservice of a sort in that we may never actually fight Sephiroth in the rest of the story, especially if the redemption arc pans out.

Honestly, i Have no problem with the Sephiroth fight itself and having it as a fanservicey moment and just an extra way to go out with a bang. For me, if they left out the whispers stuff and still had this final showdown with Sephiroth instead, i would've been accepting of that as it would still hold ground with the characters and Sephiroth as this big entity, even as a stray slightly from how they portrayed it in the original.

>I agree. I was mistaken when I wrote this. I think he has emotions and shades but doesn't actually know, and is blocked from knowing, what happens. But I don't think the game ultimately kills her again, either.

I really really hope they don't do something like keep aerith alive as a ""new"" twist on the story. I also really hope that the development team isn't going to try and create some brand new, almost spin-off of the OG game because they have a chance at a remake. I don't think anyones expecting a 1-for-1 recreation by any means, but the idea of changing game-defining story moments or restructuring the story in ways some people have theorized like time traveling Seph and Aerith or Aerith not dying in the future, or even having like...another timeline or some shit is so dumb for me and at ***that*** point, i don't consider it truly being the Final Fantasy 7 story. If they really do have that kind of intention and they go through with that progression...then i really would've fucking hoped they had been straight up and transparent and say they would be changing major story plot points instead of trying to ""surprise"" the old audience.

The reason why i love this game so much and why I'm excited in the first place for the remake and things to come is to experience an expanded re-make of events that took place in the OG game with updated graphics and characters come to life. There's a sweet spot where you can deviate elements to give a brand new life to the game, so long as certain main key points still hold tact.

>Generally, I think it was a way of accomplishing a few goals (like resurrecting Zack) that probably factor in to the future of the story. There's no way to bring him back otherwise. Combined with the final battle trope, and this is what we get.

I...don't belive they *resurrected* Zack, despite people theorizing on them being shown near the end of the game in that scene. I believed this was mostly just a fanservice moment along with the notion to cameo a character so they can alude to him and his story before gongaga (since that's the first time he's really mentioned by name iirc in the OG).

I think if there was any symbolism in that scene by having the whispers covering midgar at that cutscene was to show that whispers were an entity that surpasses time itself and by killing the arbitor in the future, the whispers of the past go away as well. I'm sure people will overthink and theorize on it, but that could just convolute discussion even more.

IMO, they already debunked Zack being alive anyway by indicating the rain at the very end. That mountain top where Zack is saying ""almost there, cloud"" is supposed to be the same point where Zack gets ambushed and gets killed after being exhausted from the fight against a ton of shinra just beforehand. I know some people could argue that the lack of whispers in that scene now indicates maybe he won't die. I'm still against heavy altering of the storyline like this. 

 I believe if anything it was showing that Aerith had a moment from the planet through the rain fall and felt there was some significant tie to that very spot and could maybe ""sense"" it in a way, as given by her expression before she starts walking toward the party.

Overall i just don't know...There's too much theorizing crazy ideas among conversations regarding the ending and the idea of the developers drastically changing key story events just sours a lot of what the rest of the remake might end up being. Idk how I'm gonna feel if they truly commit to that kind of route..."
FinalFantasy,fnqbn5q,t1_fnq848r,1587161474.0,"The script i quoted *was* the original PS1 version script, unless you meant japanese translation in the original.

> I suspect Jenova will emerge as the big bad in this game (Sephiroth redemption or not aside), and that it was Jenova sensing something through the lifestream that set things on a different course, starting in Nibelheim (as our flashbacks to everyone's youth, and angry Tifa grabbing Masamune, have no Feelers/Whispers). 

&#x200B;

>I believe in the OG, the Cetra were destroyed by Jenova, correct? 

If anyone reading doesn't want to get spoiled or haven't played the original, i'd suggest moving to another post cause I talk a lot about Jenova and Sephiroth spoilers in the OG game.

Jenova and Sephiroth will still serve as the big bad force like they did in the OG. Tbh, though I'm not really following what you are going about in this. Jenova originated as an alien riding on a meteorite that crashed into Earth at the time of Cetra and created the Northern Crater on impact. She could shapeshift and also ""infect"" people by infusing her cells into the host; Their infection would turn them into monsters. She would infect Cetra and shapshift into her victims after they died or turned into monsters and keep spreading the ""virus"". After conquering every creature on the planet she'd absorb the planet and use it as a means to travel to other planets and repeat the process

However, 2000 years or so ago the Cetra defeated her sealed her in the northern cave and then 2030 years later Shinra dug her up and mistakenly indentified her as ancient Cetra remains. This led to Hojo and Gast doing experimental testing; Injecting cells of what they thought to be an ancient cetra into people in hopes of being able to control the lifestream and/or locate ""the promised land"" in the process, but instead got these failed experiment creatures and monsters. With this process Sephiroth was created and born as the true being that was infused fully with Jenova cells' DNA from birth.

 Jenova can't really sense things through the lifestream as her powers don't work that way. Properties of her cells are that when separated, her cells will gravitate to come together into her main host body. The whole idea behind the reunion are the act of the cells finding their way back to the host body. Sephiroth was purely the one setting the reunion in motion by his own will over Jenova. Sephiroth is the true big bad over Jenova, though Jenova plays the key part to why Sephiroth has the power he has. Jenova wasn't like...pulling strings and setting the course through her will in the lifestream. Sephiroth was actually just setting in motion the reunion to himself to gain power and absorb the planet's energy to become a god himself.

If you wanna read more in depth on the origins of Jenova, i found it interesting to read the page on the wiki

 [https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Jenova](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Jenova) 

&#x200B;

>So it's not crazy to think that Aerith would sense Jenova, especially if Jenova was manipulating events against the planet's wishes, with the feelers/whispers being manifestations of the planet's will to maintain its fate. 

I don't believe that Aerith can ""sense"" jenova, or at least that was never the case in the original. Aerith spoke to the planet occasionally in the OG game, but I think it came to a head at the temple of the ancients where she was really able to speak to the ancestors of the Cetra and understand what the promised land is and what was happening. It wasn't until this point in the OG game where she took more of a lead on the situation with the planet and Sephiroth.

I think knowing this stuff is also why I kinda get put off in ways to what they did with her in the remake to a degree. her drive to understand more and have a change to truly speak to the planet is what pushes her character onward. She appropriately doesn't really reach that point until she essentially gets to the ""mecca"" place of the Cetra during the OG. Not that they can't make it work this way, but it's just odd that they felt they needed to change that part of her arc to something else. They just kinda grew her character development outside the scope of the audience and we didn't get that mini-payoff.

I'm not gonna theorycraft on the whispers stuff in relation to that because that could be way too unclear, speculatory, and overall just convoluted to try and get anywhere with."

FinalFantasy,fnq2r2t,t1_fnq2qth,1587156575.0,"**Aerith:**

As for Aerith's role switch in the remake...There's a stark contrast in tone and intention with Aerith between OG and the remake. She's not nearly as aware of anything about the ancients really or sephiroth or even Jenova for that matter. Not to say we can't have her character be this way or that I even have a problem with her taking more of an importance in being a Cetra, but you claim that she's not as self aware as I mentioned and that she's about as aware as she was in the original, which just isn't true.

Taken straight from the script when after they get captured in the elevator:

>**Tifa**Does the Promised Land really exist?  
>  
>**Aeris**...I don't know.All I know is...The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet.And...... then...The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness.  
>  
>**Tifa**...What does that mean?  
>  
>**Aeris**More than words...... I don't know.

>**Cloud**...Speak with the Planet?

>**Tifa**Just what does the Planet say?  
>  
>**Aeris**It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what they are saying.

>**Cloud**You hear it now?

>  
>**Cloud**Let's just get some sleep

Next when they find the president dead this is the conversation:

>**Cloud**What happened?  
>  
>**Palmer**Se... Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.  
>  
>**Cloud**Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?  
>  
>**Palmer**Yeah, I saw him! I saw him with my own eyes!  
>  
>**Cloud**You really saw him?  
>  
>**Palmer**Uh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!? And I heard his voice too!Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the Promised Land.  
>  
>**Tifa**Then what?Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?  
>  
>**Barret**So he's a good guy then?  
>  
>**Cloud**Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!!It's not that simple! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is different!

In the OG they establish Cloud as the leader in the situation, that he knows sephiroth over everybody else - everyone else only has a vague idea of who sephiroth is at this point. Cloud is the one that claims the stake of sephiroth being a bad guy, that is mission isn't to save the planet from shinra. He has a past with sephiroth and Aerith doesn't. That's the context that doesnt make sense. In the remake the only possible exaination would be that Aerith was told by the planet or by the cetra prior that Jenova was a thing and that there would be someone like sephiroth.

In the remake Aerith calls out Jenova when sephiroth appears and seems to know exactly what Jenova is and that she's the the big bad. Later when you're on the highway she clearly takes lead in tone, calls out to the party and asks them to help her against this evil of Jenova and sephiroth; Claims that they're the true enemy of the planet and that they need to be stopped.

To contrast this, in the original the text after you defeat motor ball at the edge of the highway is this:

>**Barret**Well, what do we do now?  
>  
>**Cloud**Sephiroth is alive. I... I have to settle the score.  
>  
>**Barret**And that'll save the Planet?  
>  
>**Cloud**...Seems like it.  
>  
>**Barret**Awright, I'm going!  
>  
>**Aeris**I'll go too. ...I have things that I want to find out.  
>  
>**Cloud**About the Ancients?  
>  
>**Aeris**......Many things.  
>  
>**Tifa**I guess this's good bye, Midgar.

The tone and roles with Aerith have been totally reworked. in the OG she and the party only speculate that Sephiroth wants something to do with the promised land as well, but for some other purpose not to save the planet. In addition to that, Aerith's motivations are to travel out, speak with the planet and discover more about herself, the cetra, and understand what the promised land is. it aligns with the parties goals because Sephiroth is involved somehow and she wants to discover why as well.

You contrast this to the remake and they establish Aerith as having some sort of mind-sooth or telepathy to ease the mind like she did with Marlene and with Red XIII. In addition they establish her knowing who Jenova was before even seeing her at the tank which sort of implied that the planet spoke to her about Jenova and possibly sephiroth and being enemies.

Aerith is different in this game. For better or for worse isn't my argument, but she definitely is established very differently than the OG."
FinalFantasy,fnq2qth,t1_fno388k,1587156571.0,"*I understand* the things that they did and the probable reasons for why they made the choices they did. The problem isn't that I didn't understand why, but that I disagree with a few things being an effective means of elaborating or expanding the story as a whole. The issues I had were of the creative ideals of ""creating something for the sake of creating it"" or  ""making bold changes to for the sake of being bold"". I don't like when story writers force mcguffins to push a narrative because it can lead to weak story telling sometimes. The story itself was already amazing without the whispers and didn't need the mcguffin of the whispers *saving them on the highway or bringing barret back to life* just to show they were controllers of Destiny and that the party had to overcome destiny. Just make the story progress through their actions and have them being affected by the world around them. The actions brought upon by the whispers were only set in place to establish them as fate-controllers so eventually the party would have to ""defy fate"". To me it just feels unnecessary and the original actions in the game would've still made for amazing story beats without it.

*I Understand* that the game *might* feel not as climactic at the end without some big battle like arbitor of fate -> Sephiroth, but at the same time it's still only a small chunk of the original story and you literally still had the experience of fighting Hojo's creations, Jenova, Rufus, The giant tank in the Lobby, and Motor ball after a big highway chase sequence. That's a lot of high-intensity climactic moments for the Midgar story and if they needed it to be *even more climactic*, then make those moments more enhanced or action filled. I was already satisfied by those sequences to call it a day and say it was a homerun of a game. With the way the ended the game, you'd almost have guessed it was the final climax of the entirety of the whole thing. The scale went to other worldly SO fast for no real reason other than to just ramp up the ending of the first iteration of the remake as a...""mix up""?

I get that most FF games end with a crazy other worldly or cross-dimensional boss fights, but again...we're like 20% into the original storyline overall; We're not fighting SAFER-Sephiroth or Jenova-SYNTHESIS yet. If we were near the end of the whole story in the final showdown it'd make a million times more sense to do. Hell, go balls to the wall and create more Sephiroth and Jenova phases or elaborate on the final segments or bring it cross dimensional in full crazy fashion - that could be hype.  I don't even care that you had a mini-showdown with Sephiroth -- again, I just thought the whole battle vs. Fate was totally unnecessary.

The ""its meta"" conversation is all speculative theory crafting for the future that we don't know yet in this game. You mentioned Cloud knows what'll happen to aerith but I disagree -- The vision is clearly illegible and even seeing the white materia  bounce into the water is cryptic.

You said you liked the choice to add the whispers and the meta aspect of the creators; That it's bold. But I don't really like the idea of *being bold for the sake of being bold*. You say it serves the plot device, but that's only because they put it in place that way to change it, not because the plot needed expanding on in the first place. All the subplots and things they did before were great and I loved expanding on side missions, Avalanche, the stuff in the train graveyard, experiencing Aerith saving Marlene in her POV, even keeping Wedge alive was interesting too. **That** is what I imagine when I think of a remake/reimagining of this game. Expansion on what the original story could've had with more story telling. Adding in all the extra bulk of story is awesome. However, what I view as shoehorning a new story element like whispers for the sake of tacking on an additional fight or trying to be more ""meta"" to the OG players (which in ways is still somewhat of a speculation and overall just theorycraft) like i said, is unnecessary.

Without this added plot device all we lose is the idea that now they're battling fate and you don't have a massive dimensional climax with the ""arbitor of fate"" at the end of this portion of the game. In the context of the overall story ***we shouldn't have needed that in the first place***. Not to say the rest of the remake is gonna be awful or that I won't play it.

FinalFantasy,fnnzrc1,t1_fnnzagk,1587106957.0,"Viewing the ending again, I think they were trying to signify that they weren't strong enough by having cloud unable to defeat him in that ""edge of creation"" scene. I think in the future they'll have another go at that at the end and it'll serve as a callback moment when we get to the final final chapter of the game. Honestly, not that bad of a payoff in ways. 

I think they can still manage to do the game justice in it's own way...Even for things like Midgar Zolom, if you scale up the beast into it being crazy big. The more i digest the sephiroth ending fight, the more I can let it slide and the more I can see that addition being okay for the game. I still really don't like the whispers stuff though."
FinalFantasy,fnnx262,t1_fnnv6k0,1587104416.0,"This is fair. I only finished my playthrough this past afternoon, so maybe I'm still processing it overall. I definitely stand by a lot of opinions that I don't like anything regarding the whispers and I felt having that as a major plot addition made the experience overall sour.   


It'll be interesting to see where they take the story. Since this is a FF7r spoiler thread and not a general FF7 i suppose I should avoid talking much about FF7 main story points jic. It's just interesting how they'll showcase his strength as opposed to the midgar Zolom. I guess they could make the Zolom *even more* big and intimidating for the party and it could still have that same impact. 

Most everything I generally don't have a problem with.  Whispers and defeating a fate-god in another dimension however,  just felt like a little overboard. The dynamics of trivial enemies in the next iteration could feel so strange after this big climactic fight if you play it back to back. Again, I suppose we'll find out eventually."
FinalFantasy,fnnv52e,t1_fnnegmg,1587102685.0,I feel like it'd make zero sense to blow Cloud's cover because there's so much underneath when it comes to his identity. If it happens sooner than mideel it would be nowhere near faithful to the original
FinalFantasy,fnndabm,t1_fnncrmb,1587089740.0,"I suppose I wasn't refuting what you were saying necessarily, but commenting on what he was saying as well. I agree with your notion and I think his comments don't really line up with how I see things either. I think people in the posts he read might have misunderstood some of the key points. 'Cause the reason Cetra were hosts were because they were the primary race of the Earth when she arrived some 2000 years prior"
FinalFantasy,fnncxkn,t1_fnnb89h,1587089509.0,"yeah I think even having the whispers as a thing could've worked better if it was somehow worked into being a part of the reunion or maybe it's a spiritual hivemind or something of Jenova while she was in captivity. Once she was released, maybe the returned to her and there was some battle involving them and Jenova in the executive room. I think creating this ""arbitors of fate"" alongside the crazy fight at the end was too over the top. Same with Sephiroth.

There's an article that explains why they didnt' take the same approach with sephiroth in the remake and I think that it takes away from the character in the rest of the game.

When it comes down to story writing in my opinion, it's not just about our perception as audience, but also seeing through the lens of our characters. ***WE*** might know exactly who sephiroth is in real life before we play the game, but that doesn't mean that our characters and the people in game need to now be on the same level as the audience. I think having sephiroth stay fairly mysterious and unknown at the end of this game will reflect in that sense for our characters. Plus, not *everybody* knows all about sephiroth or his power. I'd argue a lot of people that hadn't played the game are having their first experience with this and I think having the same points of interest with sephiroth would resonate with those people similarly as we did in our original experiences.

An example now would be how meaningless the image of Midgar Zolom impaled on a pike will feel now after experiencing a sephiroth fight where he *telepathically throws buildings at you* as well as *opens a rift gate to seemingly another dimension. Also, i guess aerith just has the power to do the same, even though I dont think the typical cetra could really do that in lore anyway.* In the OG, seeing Midgar Zolom impaled was the first time you saw the power of sephiroth and it left the party in awe of his strength."
FinalFantasy,fnnavy9,t1_fnn3vjc,1587088231.0,"iirc, I'm pretty sure Jenova - SYNTHESIS in the northern crater was supposed to be the final/true form of Jenova and was comprised of the final remaining cells of Jenova. I thought it was understood that once you defeated this jenova that the true Jenova was killed. There was only sephiroth after these events."
FinalFantasy,fnnailm,t1_fnn3ogt,1587087996.0,"Jenova was an alien creature that crashed into the planet at the time of the Cetra on a meteorite and impacted to create the northern crater. Jenova would infect Cetra hosts with a ""virus"" that turned them into mutated monsters. once they they fell victim, Jenova would mimic/shapeshift into the fallen Cetra that were infected to get closer to other Cetra and kill off their families.

Jenova would keep doing this and nearly destroy the Cetra civilization. Eventually the Cetra would go on to band together, defeat, and seal away Jenova within the northern crater, where she'd lay dormant for 2000 years.

After 2000 years and 30 years before the main events of FF7, Shinra is researching Cetra and Prof. Gast uncovers an alien creatures remains in the northern Crater and mistakenly identifies it as a Cetra. This Alien would be named Jenova.

Jenova is not a Cetra, she was only thought to be a Cetra but that was mistaken. She's actually an alien shapeshifter that turns those ""infected"" by her cells into monsters."
FinalFantasy,fnn6bdv,t1_fnn4vfn,1587085354.0,The falling into the lifestream segment is probably my favorite storytelling of FF7. Having Tifa snap him out of his Mako stuper in the pre-setting of the reactor bombing makes total sense.
FinalFantasy,fnn1i84,t1_fnmy32j,1587082425.0,"It depends on how you look at it. When im thinking about it now. I think what I dislike about them giving away certain flashbacks or him offhandedly saying ""I killed him"", feels weird because it didn't feel like the right time. I checked and I guess i forgot that in the Kalm flashback, it is depicted as cloud facing off against Sephiroth at the end and that's where they leave it. When it's put that way, it's not a big deal.

I think the problem I've had with them dealing with the Sephiroth stuff in the remake is that they're laying it in a different timeline with how things played in the OG.

in the OG Sephiroth was incredibly vague. Jenova wasn't talked about until you saw her in Shina HQ, really. At the point you leave Midgar everybody is in question about Sephiroth. What is Jenova? How did Sephiroth relate to Jenova? How did cloud know Sephiroth?. I remember in the OG that Cloud was really the only person that knew anything more than the fact that Sephiroth was a war hero. It's strikingly weird to me that they made Aerith way more self-aware about the ancients and what sephiroth's intentions are in this game.

It feels too much like the developers are leaving random breadcrumbs vaguely in cloud's visions in this game for when Cloud tells the nibelheim story in the Kalm inn in the next game. Maybe they won't even have that section? idk. To me it just felt like they could've done a few things differently.

>In OG, *despite* thinking he is 1st class, Sephiroth was leagues away at this point. The Midgar Zolom showed that Sephiroth was way stronger. Cloud was convinced there was no way he killed Sephy at Nibelheim. This left space for grow the whole game until you battled Sephiroth at the end.

This definitely makes for an important point imo. I think what i didn't like about the sephiroth fight is that you fought him to begin with. You literally fight and ""defeat"" him (even though it's not truly defeating him). I felt like part of the fight was almost a shot for shot recreation of the climax of advent children. You now have this idea as a player that you're not that far behind sephiroth in strength.

In OG, Sephiroth felt so much more mysterious in terms of his power and Jenova still feels vague and like a mystery as well. I mean, iirc you dont even fight jenova until Junon cargo boat and now you're fighting it in shinra HQ. Now if they even have the Midgar Zolom scene, it might not even feel as impactful unless they go extreme with it. 

After all...at this point we've literally seen Sephiroth open a dimensional portal and summon a giant meteor to destroy the planet. From ***that*** we're gonna see a giant snake impaled on a stake? EZ -- nothing impressive about it. I personally think they went overboard with the sephiroth fan service in the remake instead of going insane and all out in the final intallment."
FinalFantasy,fnmvgrw,t1_fnmuvtl,1587078938.0,I don't blame people for using her or finding her effective. I just personally didn't find her as fun to play or utilize most the time. I personally got a lot more enjoyment out of unleashing attack combo strings and such from Tifa or Cloud. Even in the OG I strayed away from using offensive magic all that much. The only times I was really using spells outside of magnify+support magic  in my run was if i knew there was an enemy weakness. I'd just use it to stagger and unleash with physical attacks.
FinalFantasy,fnmu237,t1_fnm718f,1587078165.0,">The problem now is that, if he doesn't, this scene will be bizarrely pointless to a newcomer.

This is why I hate things like bad mcguffins and introducing story points that don't really serve the narrative effectively. I've posted a few other times, but I really suspect the whole whispers concept came from wanting to have a bigger ending than just getting to the end of the highway. They probably were like ""wouldn't it be cool if we had the party fight sephiroth? How could we make this happen?

I think it's such a fatal flaw to fight sephiroth because now...***you fought sephiroth and beat him in a fight***. The more sephiroth they put in this iteration of the remake, the more they take away from the mystery of his character and his intentions.

I mean...we didn't learn the intentions or his grand plan until maybe half way-ish through the original after traveling around. We have now be introduced to him being...able to summon a meteor to Midgar? Was even weirder how they introduced Meteor in the Midgar shinra tourist tour and it being chalked as ""oh, we've been having malfunctions in the simulation system as of late"". Introducing that moment didn't need to be there imo. It felt like they did that just so they could *also* have sephiroth summon a giant meteor in the final fight and not have it be as unexpected.

Just knowing the pacing of the OG rest of the story from here makes me wonder where the hell they're gonna go with it and what they're gonna do from here. They just fought an interdimensional god-kaiju like being that was essentially the embodiment of fate and now they're gonna go back to having conflicts with rabbid animals and lesser creatures in the plains by midgar. 

It's fine if they go into the classic FF ""killing gods"" motif that happens at the end of a lot of FF games, but make it at the end of the entirety of FF remake, not right at the beginning of the story lol."
FinalFantasy,fnmslmd,t1_fnkofxc,1587077367.0,">Cloud knows he killed Sephy tho he doesn't in OG at this point etc

This alone is such a strange thing to navigate through in the remake.

The remake's taking so much away from further reveals that take place in the original. I think all of the sephiroth mental freakouts Cloud had should've all just been revolving around imagery of Jenova, cryptic talk about the reunion, and visions of sephiroth like the first time you see him after the original reactor bombing. We ended up getting visions of cloud's past and even...future??

The moment we started getting images of the future ***from not only the whispers, but cloud visions***, it lost me a bit.

Cloud as well as the audience should be under full assumption and understanding that He is Cloud, Ex-SOLDIER - 1st class.

The OG has no where near as many flashbacks or visions for cloud. It was like reactor 1 bombing, reactor 2 bombing, and then Hojo's lab after he sees Jenova. Even then, it's really just Cloud basically having a panic attack for a moment because he sees Jenova in a test tank. The only thing commented is basically ""how did they get it here??""."
FinalFantasy,fnmrm0d,t1_fnludi0,1587076827.0,">When I first saw people making the analogy to fans, I assumed it was people being tongue-in-cheek, but taking it seriously, and then assuming the devs are actively trolling the fans is ridiculous. The Whispers aren't even all bad.

The notion that the developers are trolling the fans could be a stretch and it might not be rooted in a petty nature. I will say though, that even if it's not meant to be petty, at the very best the whispers plot felt like a mcguffin to create different story beats and shoehorn a scenario that'd allow for the climactic battle with the fate-arbitor-god-kaiju thing as well as sephiroth at the end.

I think it's unfortunate that they felt they *had* to have some big climactic other dimensional battle to close out the first installment of the remake. There's definitely a lot of intention there to go out of the way to ignore the will of a cleaner beat-by-beat remake.

This game didn't need anything about the whispers and honestly didn't need to have a showdown with sephiroth.

IIRC, no one really knew much about sephiroth and everything surrounding him was a mystery really. He was just ""some legendary war hero"", especially do everybody but Cloud. In the remake Aerith all the sudden knows everything about Jenova as well as Sephiroth's intentions whereas she definitely didn't know that in the OG.

Even with cloud, the motivation after midgar was because he killed president shinra and left with Jenova's body. There were a lot of unanswered questions and there was only one real answer - follow sephiroth. This still follows mostly true until post-highway. If they left it to the stuff at shinra tower it'd have been fine. They even could've just had it so that when sephiroth ""flew"" away outside president shinra's office that he was just gone and you didn't have the whole chase after him up the ladder sequence, only for the chase to be thwarted by whispers.

The remake practically answers every question or teases story points that only get revealed 1/2  into the original storyline...and it does it all within the last couple hours."
FinalFantasy,fnmpg7x,t1_fnm2zj5,1587075670.0,"Exactly. Cause like, for every action they prevented with the whispers there could've been an entirely reasonable story beat that could've happened that didn't involve them and it'd have been just fine. Like instead of having that moment with reno, have it end by maybe the other guards slipping past cloud due to Reno distracting him or preventing him from stoping the guards. The guards chase aerith into the next room and you're forced to chase after Aerith to save her, thus disengage with Reno. 

I'll stand by the fact that we just *didn't* ***need*** *anything* involving whispers in the remake. They also soured the ending for me by shoehorning this big sephiroth fight at the end."
FinalFantasy,fnmoeaa,t1_fnl9l96,1587075112.0,"It's all so crazy to me, because I'm a diehard fan of the original. I think there's very little to truly criticize in this game if the big twists and recons of the whispers and stuff didn't happen. The only things I noticed I had problems for were occasional hilariously bad lip-flap moments or how the backdrops of certain city environments looked way too much like a blurry background images. Quests and NPCs, fine. Graphics and combat, incredibly awesome and satisfying to play. Even with the storyline changes, adding and expanding on wall market, corneo sewers, and the train graveyard were all really cool world building additions. 

When it came down to it, I really really just didn't like the idea of changing major story plots with this whispers/fate-ghost mcguffin device. That's by far the one and only thing that takes me a bit out of this remake. If they had incorporated it into just being some sort of strangeness for the reunion or some strange jenova magic it'd even have been a little different to me. 

Instead they made the whispers some weird mcguffin plot device that really only aided the game in creating a shoehorned big ending after motor ball, which led to a crazy fan-service fight with Sephiroth. But then there's weird stuff like, why they even had to include meteor? They literally saw a Shinra visual simulation showing meteor annihilating the city and it was chalked up as ""oh hehe, the program has been malfunctioning recently"". Some of the directive decisions with the story just felt so strange, especially when you already have a concrete outline from the original."
FinalFantasy,fnmmo5g,t1_fnju7ta,1587074202.0,"This is an incredibly well written take on the remake imo. it's so strange to me, because everything about the game was so well done. Every expanded section down to each of the slums, the side missions, and following corneo into the sewers felt like a really cool addition to the game and the world as a whole. It was only until the last couple hours where everything really really fell off the rails, as you said. I believe that if they left out the whispers, and stayed true to the original on main story beats that it would've been an absolute homerun - a fucking knock it out of the park moment for newcomers and oldcomers to the game.

At worst we got a contrived bomb in the face of oldcomers to break the fourth wall and create a separation of expectation. At best we were thrown a mcguffin simply just to further the story climax into an interdimensional fight vs a fate-god-kaiju monster. For me, either way it felt weird and also took me out of my enjoyment for the actual story that I love.

If what they'd done is truly a tell for future remake parts, then i'm nervous for what they'll do to the main story. New story plots, retconning character deaths, and creating forced story climaxes aren't even necessary. I understand ""*It's a remake/reimagining"",*  but the game in and of itself is so fucking amazing without any of that. we'll see where it goes in part II though, i suppose."

FinalFantasy,fnmjyuz,t1_fnkmc9z,1587072794.0,"The ghosts were kind of a miss moment for me. Only because I see it as a mcguffin to shoehorn a more climactic ending for the player instead of ending it at the end of midgar highway or on a midgar cliffside.

My biggest gripe besides the ghosts personally, was the whole seeing into the future thing. Time will tell for what they do with it i suppose. Just knowing what's supposed to happen and what they did and what they might do has be slightly hesitant for the future. I really just hope they don't get *too* extra/meta with the changes.

I loved the changes to small sub-points to liven up the world or creating side-missions like the wall-market Colosseum or having to go back down to the sewers and fighting that monster again. But when it comes to the main plot beats there's such an already amazing story without adding unnecessary elements."
FinalFantasy,fnmjeaw,t1_fnm61bd,1587072496.0,"I feel you on this man. Being such a big fan of the original, the mood and feel of these characters in the overarching story feels slightly off now after finishing, even though I'm not sure how to put it myself. It could be a stretch, but in a way it doesn't even feel like I'm going to be playing the same game (which might be their point). I don't think we needed to cram so much into this first remake iteration. Even without the ghosts, the story was sufficient and the characters filled in all the story that we needed as an audience.

Overall, I think not having these fate-ghosts, not having anything about meteor, and not even having a fight with sephiroth would've been fully appropriate and kept the story true. My problem with having multiple iterations like this is that the developers are going to feel like they need to make each game forced into some big climax fight to ""satisfy"" the player for getting to the ""end"" of the game. 

it feels so weird, because we've literally just faced an other-dimensional fate-god kaiju creature as a forced mcguffin climax of this game, all because they introduced these fate-ghosts that control what the party can and cant do...all complete with shoehorning moments like having barret stabbed and ***brought back to life*** or saving the party on the highway (several times) soley because I think they just wanted a bigger ending then just having them overlooking the sunset on the cliffside or on the uncompleted highway at the end of Midgar.

More of this games story at the biggest moments revolves around these fate-ghosts than the actual characters and their motives/decisions. The original didn't have these mcguffin moments and I don't think the remake really needed them either tbh. Hopefully the overall story years down the road will make the ending not feel too extra and the story will tie up well."
FinalFantasy,fnmhaqw,t1_fnjndtd,1587071415.0,"There's a lot to unpack with the story changes they made and I'm really not sure how to feel about it tbh. 

* I dont like that Aerith is *this* self aware of sephiroth and an overarching ""big bad"" against the planet.
* I thought the ghosts and fate stuff were a weird convoluted story device that didnt even *need* to exist. The story itself is great without turning it into some ""we're fighting against fate"" kind of plotline. It felt like the just used the ghosts as a mcguffin to have a bigger climax to the Midgar arc. 
* Why did we need to have some ""other-dimensional battle vs a kaiju *fate* god""? Seriously, it felt too much like we were in the final chapter of the overarching story and not at the end of a major chapter of the story. We still have 2-3 more games worth of story to go and we already defeated an other-dimensional ***god of fate***.
* Like...did we NEED to fight sephiroth at all? I feel like a **big** part of playing the original was Sephiroth feeling like this mysterious legendary warrior that shows up, but instead we got this god of spacetime, creating portals to other realities. 
* They've introduced meteor SO early.
* Also, what was the point of having the sephiroth stabs and ""kill"" barret moment?? They could've, you know...Just had the president stabbed and have Sephiroth say something  cryptic or whatever. Instead they had to force the moment of barret getting stabbed and ***get brought back to life***, just because they wanted to show the impact of these fate-ghost beings.

Overall I just dislike the adding of new elements that don't NEED to be there. The ghosts feel like it took away from the overall choices of the characters - Everything can only happen if its ""*according to fate*"", which feels super lame to me. I think the only parts I have with the remake are the main story beats of the ending segments of the game. The ghosts created WAY too many mcguffin moments to either save the party or prevent them from acting. idk, man."

I used to be so heavy into just pop-punk and metalcore from maybe 14-25 years old or so. It's interesting for me because I used to be just like them in some ways. I used to hate on rap, country, and pop was so meh to me. 

I can honestly really attribute my current growth in music appreciation to my best friend who ventured out into other music over the past 5 years, which extended to me growing a lot in the past 2-3 years. The thing that I'm learning is that when you limit yourself like that in music, you miss out on so much fucking good music out there. Some of his biggest jams now are like...Valley, Carly Rae Jepsen, the 1975, and No Rome.

The vast majority of the bands/albums I've been listening to the past couple years are definitely not pop punk and are either straight pop or indie-pop: Fickle Friends, No Rome, The 1975, Valley, Now Now, The Aces, The Midnight, and I even got into the new Jonas Brothers as well as getting heavily into BTS and all their music. I NEVER would have seen myself listening to any of these bands, especially Jonas brothers and BTS when I was in high school or college and it's such a shame, cause they're so good if you can open your mind to new things.

I think the only bands I got into that were even remotely pop-punk were A Will Away and a lesser known band called No Dice, but even A Will Away to me leans more into that indie-alternative-pop-emo kind of niche.
