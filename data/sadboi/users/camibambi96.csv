sex,exj4olu,t1_exih66r,1566341907.0,"Honestly I didn’t really open my eyes to truly how messed up this situation kinda is until like yesterday. Before then I just kinda dismissed and uncomfortable feelings I had about it since he did eventually stop. And I just kinda justified everything because he said he loved me and if he loves me he wouldn’t purposely hurt me, but now I’m not so sure...

But no I haven’t got to discuss it with him yet because 1) I was trying to figure out if this really was a big deal or if it was something really minor that I just overthought enough until it seemed like a big issue 2)he’s mentioned in the past that he’d probably kill himself if we ever broke up and he already thinks he’s a horrible human being, so I’m pretty scared if he realizes what he did to me he would hurt himself"

sex,exi7plv,t1_exhrw1g,1566322735.0,I’m kinda scared what he’d do if I brought it up to his attention. He already thinks he’s a horrible person. Given some of the things he’s said to me before I feel like he might try to commit suicide.
sex,exi7aft,t3_cszcd5,1566322494.0,"Like I don’t think I actually said the word “no” but I definitely said “I’m not ready yet” “not yet” “I think it’s too soon” I’m pretty sure I said “*his name* dont”. Does that still count as saying no or does it have to be the actual word no?

Also thank you everyone so much for your responses. I’ve been having a very difficult time processing all of this and you’ve been very helpful."
