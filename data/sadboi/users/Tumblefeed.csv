ftm,fjenpio,t3_fbpfo1,1583275097.0,"SELLING: 

Emisil gen 3, skin color 06. Sealed in package, never used. Color was too dark and shipping back overseas is a pain so I figured I'd see if someone wanted it cheap that couldn't afford it otherwise. 

I'm just asking 100 bucks plus shipping. Pm and I'll send a shitload of pics in diff lighting for you :)

Edit: Erection insert included at no cost."

She looks so beautiful and majestic. And then you know she's just all of a sudden going to plummet and be swallowed up by the water. It's so real. Thanks so much for sharing."

Consult to surgery was around three months, only because I had to wait for my insurance claim (Which the office took care of). 


Process was simple, I was referred by a friend who had top surgery through Turkeltaub. Went in for consultation, they processed the claim, got approval letter in the mail, scheduled a month out from that date (They made me stop T a month prior) then showed up for surgery!"

GC2B Half XL: Grey, Purple, Nude.

GC2B Half XXL: Black

GC2B Full XL: Black


None of them have been worn for longer than 6 months, elasticity still really really good. Selling them for 15 dollars each, with free shipping :) 


The XXL I just used for working out, the full XL I only had for like a month before surgery. 


Also cool side note I have the Korean gene that makes it so my sweat doesn't smell like anything/ I don't sweat that much. So they're really great condition!!!


Can send pics!"

When I started ds2 didn't know you had to double click X to open illusionary walls so this guy kept smacking it with his sword and I kept smacking it and nothing was happening. Thought he was trolling me LOL...."
bloodborne,esmbo39,t1_eskxmtf,1562102095.0,I find it's pretty easy to 1v1 most monsters because I abuse the range of the whip and constantly backstep! It was hard as hell to do on that tiny roof and I honestly had to use like 8 estus XD

Partzilla has pretty cheap stuff but like OP said don't order from them if you need anything urgently. Be prepared to wait at least two weeks."
motorcycles,eoody7p,t1_eoodlyj,1558736191.0,"Yeah my first week after the course was scary tbh lol. I'm also in Mesa... we probably got the same exact instructor honestly. He irritated me so much. I was the only one in my class who had never driven manual so I felt like he really skipped over alot of important information about clutch control. 

Send me a PM if you want a rider buddy, I'm still learning alot myself!"
motorcycles,eoo9r5b,t1_eoo9dse,1558733163.0,"...Did you go to TEAM Arizona? 
And yeah the same for me, I stalled once at a stoplight the first time I rode in traffic because of the nerves, but as long as you just hold the clutch in the friction zone, apply generous throttle, and then let go of the clutch it works every time. 
What city are you in? I can recommend some nice empty parking lots if you're nearby!"
motorcycles,eoo5qj1,t1_eon538q,1558730038.0,"I'm also in Arizona and took the course a couple weeks ago. Had the same exact experience. The instructor kept telling me it was because I was releasing the clutch too fast (I wasn't) and I was frustrated because I kept stalling no matter how slow I released it.

With like an hour left to go in the class one of the other trainers told me the real issue was not enough throttle.

I think the problem is they teach you to do it without throttle for the first exercise to get a feel for the friction zone..."
