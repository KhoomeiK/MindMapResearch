Not the part where she has like stockholm with the Putnams and Aunt Lydia... but how she mentally breaks.. and clearly she was a strong girl that was against it and had an attitude at the beginning at the Rachel and Leah center (that got her eye taken). I don‚Äôt know id be a mix of her, June, and Emily. I don‚Äôt know... this show is honestly just terrifying as a woman.

mentalhealth,fmukqgg,t3_fx2qdr,1586393321.0,"Mine has def improved. I‚Äôm a 30 year old female union factory worker. My job is extremely physical and strenuous, but i NEED it for the money and mostly the health insurance. For 11 years from age 18-29 i didnt have health coverage. I saw a few different therapists through referrals from the free clinic i went to, but it didnt really help. Over that decade i was in college for 2.5 years and ended up just not going back one day and leaving bc everything in my life was too much. I live in a very toxic household and started working at age 14, and tried college so i could not end up like my parents... and in that time i tried at least 5 different SSRIs (anti depressants) but they didnt really ever work.

During the year prior to me starting my job at Ford (and having health coverage) I was In a very bad place. A new SSRI seemed like it was helping a little bit possibly, but it caused me to do stuff in my sleep and it was scary. I tried a new one and it made me worse, which is something i had felt the SSRIs had always done, thats why i never took them for long. At about age 22 i started to realize more and more that i knew what was wrong with me mentally, but i didnt have the health coverage to actually find out. 

Age 29 my insurance was finally in full swing and i made an appointment with a psychiatrist and was finally properly diagnosed. She said that I have bipolar disorder (what i figured it was for years) and that anti depressants actually make you WAY worse and cause you to ‚Äúrapid cycle‚Äù...she is still my psychiatrist and i have also been seeing a therapist. Even though I‚Äôm really unhappy at my job i need it for the excellent pay, and free, amazing, health insurance. It‚Äôs saved my life.

On the 13th of March I worked my last shift due to COVID-19. that week i only worked 2 out my 4 shifts bc i was in a bad place mentally that week and i used my two days that i am allowed to use if i need a mental health day. I get two days a month that i can use to stay home if needed through my FMLA (family medical leave act) paperwork. So my check that week was only fir 2 days. Luckily the week before i got my yearly profit sharing check so i had a decent amount of cash at the time...so for the first 3 weeks of not working i had no money worries even though i didnt have any coming in. 

During the first 3 weeks of being laid off i have been in such a great place mentally. I have been painting, crafting, cleaning, organizing, reading, started a new skin care routine, writing, sleeping well and napping sometimes, cooking for myself and the family ( due to my work hours i can‚Äôt due this generally)... i have been in a really great place mentally, and i know it‚Äôs bc i have not had to work. However, due to all this i had to blow that money and I‚Äôm getting really scared that i will not be able to move into my friends apartment in June when their roommate leaves as planned. Which is something that i REALLY need in order to prosper. Two days after valentines day last year my boyfriend of 3 years that i lived with woke up one morning and dumped me and kicked me out of our apt...three days after being added to my phone contract and getting new phones... and a week after i got in a terrible car accident totaling my 3 month old car and breaking my sternum...he was an asshole i guess, and i had to move back home, and buy a bed and a car... so this past year i have been rebuilding my life. 

So yes, for the first 3 weeks i was in an amazing place mentally, bc i didnt have the stress of my job. Ive already been aware that i feel i only have 5-10 good years of working full time in me. My job is so exhausting and since I‚Äôm on an assembly line it‚Äôs all mindless, physical work that leave me trapped in my head for 12 hours straight. Plus the hour commute back and forth, i can‚Äôt do anything but work, eat, sleep during my work week. I know I‚Äôm only 30, but ive been working since i was 13, and have always worked very hard trying to get away from my toxic life. I have already feared that i mentally won‚Äôt be able to handle full time for that much longer, and this real segmented that I‚Äôm right. That work is too stressful at times for my mental health to be able to get up on time, get myself out of bed, get there on time and do the work. I can go a month without needing a break but if i have a bipolar episode i don‚Äôt know when it comes, what to expect, or how long it will stay. I mean, i can be a feminist and know that at the end of the day i need extra care, and if i get married I‚Äôm gonna need someone that understands that, and i can hopefully go to working part time only, and somewhere much easier, and that i may actually enjoy. 

So now that my money is gone, and my unemployment still has yet to start coming in, i am starting to get really anxious. Also, i live bear chicago and northwest indiana, so the weather is really changing. When the weather starts getting nice, and i can smell it in the air, and it‚Äôs sunny out, i get really really anxious. I don‚Äôt know what it is, like reverse seasonal affective or perhaps my body remembering trauma. My first, clear, bipolar depressive phase started at age 22, at this time when the weather was changing for spring. It lasted til October and for the first time i understood how people could end their life. I was no stranger to depression, but this was different. For some reason i knew i would never be the same. Now, bc of that long bipolar episode i get super anxious at even the smell of nice weather. Not always, but it can be bad when it does.

So, i was in a really good place during this for weeks. The happiest i had been in a VERY VERY long time. But I‚Äôm super anxious now....however, i think if my unemployment was coming in i would still be in a great place... i really do hope that you feel better. If you need to talk you can send me a PM, all i have is time... just know that you are not alone. We are a community."
13ReasonsWhy,fmqah0d,t3_fwocoy,1586295940.0,"Like others have stated, it‚Äôs not an unpopular opinion. And like others have said, it‚Äôs not to blame him, but to explain herself and why she acted that way towards him in hopes of helping him understand, HE needed to be on the tapes for her full story.

Now, I‚Äôm a 30 year old female that loves the show. It‚Äôs not flawless, it‚Äôs not genius writing/directing like Breaking Bad. It‚Äôs not even that good of acting on most parts. However, I do love the show.


As for the pet peeve situation. You tell the story of the girl you knew...I have a few thoughts. It seems like this might be a high school girl or a girl just out of high school. I could be completely wrong, but anyway, its definitely not uncommon like you said. If a guy asks you out in a simple way and you decline at first its not bad. The majority (not all) men would say that ‚Äòthe chase‚Äô is the best part. So i would have to say that equally, most women think being chased is thrilling. This is all based off your situational story so I‚Äôm going hetero normative in my statements. Women are turned on most by BEING desired, which often translates into who they decide to date. If a man asks a woman out and she says shes in a relationship then i say don‚Äôt ask again. However, sometimes people are guarded and it might take warming up. Sometimes a woman wants to know it‚Äôs THEM you want a date with and not just any date, so the pursuit is important. 

My point (though rambling) is that it‚Äôs ridiculous to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs something all girls do.‚Äù Thats just incorrect. I have never told a person no, with hopes that they would keep asking. And as a woman i admit it can be super effin tricky for a man to know what to do. You want to be persistent but not creepy. Flattering but not creepy. At the end of the day asking people out is completely situational...and so are the responses. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúall girls do...‚Äù

Also, don‚Äôt say girls ‚Äúsimply don‚Äôt want to try‚Äù because thats some bullshit. The girl in your story clearly wanted to be courted and have someone desire her enough to put extra effort. Thats what SHE wanted. Not every woman out there. Some women want to be proposed to in front of an audience and have a photographer catch the moment... others (like myself) don‚Äôt want anyone around but me and my person. Some people like grand gestures, others don‚Äôt. Again, all situational for different PEOPLE and not ALL of one gender..people are different and are complex. Part of me also wonders if this story is about you asking out a girl and maybe holding a grudge about it. Not trying to be shitty, it just has an ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this friend..‚Äù vibe to it. 

As for Hannah (I‚Äôm aware shes not real) i think it‚Äôs pretty fucked up the way you talk about her. It‚Äôs clear you hate her character, but damn... i kinda feel like you don‚Äôt get the point of the show, like at all. Yes, Hannah did not open up to Clay about her problems, but i think she wanted to. She had major mental health issues, and not in a ‚ÄúTumblr sad‚Äù way. I mean, she killed herself.. Hannah didn‚Äôt purposely try to ‚Äòmindfuck‚Äô Clay. She had too many emotions and didn‚Äôt have coping skills to address them and handle them. She loved Clay and was so lost and traumatized herself that she didn‚Äôt know how to tell him any of it. She didn‚Äôt know how to tell ANYONE what she was feeling. As a character Hannah was very flawed, and did a lot of unreasonable shit. She expected the people around her to know what she wanted and what she was thinking, which is childish. BUT...if you can‚Äôt empathize with her as a character/person than the show isn‚Äôt for you. 

You say the show was difficult to watch for you. Thats not uncommon, it was very difficult for me to watch at times. But it‚Äôs clearly difficult for you for a very different reason for most. Honestly, it‚Äôs def not even a great show with how much i love it. It‚Äôs a show with teenagers as a target audience to help address the cruelty and difficulty of mental health first and foremost. Other seasons addressing things like substance abuse, socioeconomic status, undocumented citizens, ICE, rape, rehabilitation, homelessness, toxic masculinity, bullying, assault, body dysmorphia, feminism, abuse and abandonment, etc etc etc....

The fact that the characters are high schoolers completely justifies their stupid and ridiculous decisions. They‚Äôre in fucking high school. They make shitty decisions. Their brains aren‚Äôt developed all the way yet, shit. It just seems with the tone and word choice that you completely missed the point of the show. You don‚Äôt seem to have any empathy for any of the characters, or an understanding of anything relating to mental health...and i could be wrong, but the last part you wrote makes it seem like you think everyone sucks with the exception of BRYCE. I REALLY really hope not..."
GoodGirls,fm67pqr,t3_ft7x2i,1585788062.0,"I mean, i don‚Äôt know. 

Thing is, the ages of the actresses are 31, 40,45... so it adds up as far as that goes. I mean it‚Äôs very clear that (no matter how gorgeous and great they look for their age) Beth and Ruby are in their 40s..

As far as Annie goes it‚Äôs clear that shes early 30s as well. I do not recall the scene with the ‚Äúpoop her out at prom‚Äù statement, but maybe (knowing Annie) it was more of a joke about her having Ben at a really young age. 

If we go with Annie currently being/turning 33, and apply the general time length of 3 seasons=3 years, then Annie was 30 at pilot time. It was pointed out that at pilot Ben was 11 years old, and now we have concluded that Annie was 30 at the same time. Which would put Ben (with the 3 year difference) at age 14, which seems about right fir current episodes. 

So, at pilot Annie is 30, Ben is 11. 
Then current Annie is 33, Ben is 14. 
This makes for a 19 year difference in age. 

As far as prom goes, traditionally, you are only allowed to go to prom as a Junior, or Senior. My school was like that and I graduated in 2008. Generations before only allowed Senior class to prom, and Juniors could attend IF their date was a Senior. 
When I was at my senior prom I was 18, and was turning 19 two months later. I was never held back in school, my birthday was two weeks past the deadline to start Kindergarten, which made me older than most kids in my grade. Thats not an uncommon occurrence, and thats without being held back. If Annie was like me she could have been 19 at prom (If that statement was not a joke) or if she was held back a grade she could have definitely been 19 when she had Ben, no problem. 

This age thing all makes sense... but inly IF the series has been 3 years from beginning to current  day. I hope that brings some clarity üòÇ

What I really wanna know is why so many different kids play the roles of Beth‚Äôs children ü§£ü§£ each child has had two actors play them and I almost feel like every time I see her kids it‚Äôs a new combination üòÖüòÇ"

GoodGirls,flpt2f2,t1_flpqmbe,1585368019.0,"I do see your point, i guess i just think it‚Äôs better than how it started. I do however completely agree with how you said she can‚Äôt be a criminal and a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù to an extent. All crime eventually has these consequences. And like you said, Beth is seriously delusional thinking Rio is the obstacle. She will be fine after. The truth is they will get taken advantage of like at the beginning. It‚Äôs a very particular place she needs to be whenever rio is gone for her to maintain his level without legit hardened criminals being like ‚Äúnah bitch, go back to panera‚Äù  haha. The point is even though beth saw lucys death she STILL thinks shes invincible. 

I do like how they made rio go back to not caring about her, they made him soft. I am super excited to see where this all goes bc it can go in soo many directions. 

One think i would loveeee to see is (i don‚Äôt recall if they have ever mentioned them before) a night where Beth and Annies parents come to dinner some night at beth‚Äôs. Like i want to know who raised these two very opposite people. I think that could be a comedic relief episode."

bdsm,fk2izew,t1_fk2d0kf,1583802102.0,"I like this answer. To me it seems communication is the entire thing. My understanding is that the sub is the one who sets the limits and is in control, then they give over their control to the dom. Anything i have learned or read about it has always made me excited thinking about it. Even parts that i don‚Äôt think id be into i can see the reasoning behind it usually. The communication in it is very healthy and i think that probably reflects in the non sexual aspects of a relationship as well. Thank you."

But i know I‚Äôm not into age play. I don‚Äôt want any of that or even to talk like a baby or anything. Not judging those that do, just not my jam, it‚Äôs a turn off. But saying yes daddy or having a bratty attitude. Yes. Thats why i asked that. Also dollification was something i would be interested in, so i think thats where the dress and hair comes in and why i was questioning if it always age play."
riverdale,fjn4210,t1_fjn2hee,1583497166.0,"For one, I highly suggest Scream, especially if you like campy horror. Depending on your age it might be a little dated but it still holds up. 

For two, Skeet Ulrich (in Scream) is stating that corn syrup is what they used AS the ‚Äúpigs blood‚Äù when making the movie. #themoviemagic"

riverdale,fjmbu25,t1_fjkp9jn,1583466440.0,"Right! The parallel was so good. Thats one of my favorite things about RD, all of the classic horror references and representation. I just wish they would have had FP say ‚ÄúCorn Syrup. Same thing they used for pigs‚Äô blood in Carrie.‚Äù"

Nathan is the identical one."
riverdale,fjgbgrh,t3_fd63zo,1583320663.0,"This season is SO good. The Gryphons & Gargoyles story line was so bad. The farm was good by itself, so was Archie and being in that fight club.. but G&G was trash."
13ReasonsWhy,fjembie,t3_fcwqug,1583274273.0,I understand both sides of it. Especially since i have a history of  self harm back to age 14. I did myself a grand favor as a huge fan of cinema and tv and purchased season one on DVD on Amazon.
GoodGirls,fizf1it,t1_fizetnh,1582861153.0,It‚Äôs totally okay. But depending on your taste in TV and movies... id say you MUST watch it.
GoodGirls,fizez75,t1_fizd7ee,1582861109.0,"THANK YOU! Yes, exactly. I relate to Annie a lot on an emotional level. I‚Äôm 30, not married, put my whole heart into everything and maybe don‚Äôt think it all out the best. BUT that scene with her and Ben you are describing HITS. I have been my moms go to person, her therapist, the person she told everything to since i was under the age of 10. Exactly like Ben explains. My mom told me even more though, like i would gave known almost everything. Which i think it‚Äôs safe to say Ben pretty much does bc he‚Äôs smart and observative. My mom told me how much money they had, ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù my money, told me to answer the door when the land lord knocked and say she wasnt home... i was in the dark about nothing so I‚Äôm just like Ben there. I have mentioned throughout the years my mom needs a therapist. Recently since i have to stay there for a while ive had regular serious talks with her about going and that it‚Äôs super dysfunctional she treated me as a friend and put adult stress on me as a child. Ahhhh this turned into a me story and not a Good Girls one I‚Äôm so sorry. I typed it so if you read it cool, haha. 

But yes, Annie is realizing things, and baby steps is what it‚Äôs going to have to be. I believe she will open up and they will fall for each other over time, which I‚Äôm down for as long as she heals herself first. Possibly he will tell her how he feels and it will be her all healed and not interested and won‚Äôt believe him... but it will come together.. maybe. I know it‚Äôs only been one episode but i really liked him and he is quick witted like Annie... also, hes a child psychologist so he has to like her/want to see her to be willing to talk to her like a patient or he would have legit said ‚Äúlady, you need yo go upstairs.‚Äù 

Also i think it‚Äôs good shes talking to him (maybe for free bc of his credentials.. pro bono?) because it‚Äôs her way to get the help she needs without relying on her ex and his wife... which dint get me started on that mcmansion situation just like Annie said haha"

I have bipolar disorder, panic, and anxiety disorder. My parents also helped put me in an insane amount of debt. All i ever wanted was a sibling so i would have had at least one person that understood exactly what i was going through and we could have helped each other. Maybe also could have moved out ASAP since it‚Äôs too difficult to financially live on your own at a young age. I‚Äôm 30, and i still feel that way, possibly more."
interiordecorating,fhm5wwd,t3_f3x8wh,1581708726.0,"To be more descriptive, it‚Äôs clearly an old building. It‚Äôs a second floor apt downtown and is above store fronts. There is one on the 3rd floor as well, and there is a built in porch area on the other side of the window that houses stairs. I have not seen this room in the day to see how much light really comes in the windows. I‚Äôm really hoping they let in a lot of light, but unfortunately I am pretty sure they won‚Äôt. Interior decorating is something i have a lot of interest in but don‚Äôt have any schooling for or anything. I am very artsy/creative but this is an old unit that I will be renting, so i can‚Äôt really change anything. Just looking for some tips, if there are any. Would be greatly appreciated."
riverdale,fh9pyni,t1_fh9267d,1581386973.0,Thats my truth as well. But i understand what women who like that type see. Muscles have never done much for me. Season 2 Archie was such a toxic masculinity kinda jock guy. I prefer the jughead a thousand times over. But i think most riverdale fans see appeal in both
riverdale,fh9p1lr,t1_fh8tvxi,1581386368.0,"Truth be told I‚Äôm total jughead, but see the appeal of the physical manly aspect of Archie. But i like dark, brooding, smart, creative guys haha"

greysanatomy,ffzeaop,t3_evnpnz,1580374709.0,"Thanks for the reply! 

I‚Äôm very positive of my diagnosis. Especially with the definitive phases i have had. However, I wonder if you can have both? I have been a self harmer for over 16 years. Some years id only do it once. Many of them. Others several times. Various types of self harm as well. 

I also have a history of these bad relationships. Both of my parents are huge ones. I am currently back at home at age 30 and the relationships with my parents from growing up are haunting me. My first boyfriend is another example. We were together for 7 years, and engaged for 2 years before i called it quits and gave him his ring back."

sex,ffk3hnm,t3_etv9qj,1580014665.0,"So nobody finds the father/daughter a little odd. 

I posted a helpful comment to the OP above, but after reading your comments...

Most of you think the dad seems so chill.. I‚Äôm a 30f and i think something is a little off.. possibly, no clear yes. The fact that it starts with her putting lotion on her dad (a super normal thing in context) but then she says her dad seems tense and gives him a massage, thats a little odd imo. And i have always had a very close relationship with my dad. But then she does the part where she straddles you etc... while her dad is watching. Idc how old i am... I‚Äôm not going to fucking straddle any guy in front of my father.. especially in this situation where the teenage boy was clearly going to get a boner..

A lot of ppl mentioned dd/lg resemblance and they might just have a non incest playful dynamic... but when shes straddling a guy her age with a boner rubbing him down in her (probably) bikini.., it takes a sexual dynamic... 

Most dads would either freak out/rage/not allow it... or they would be calm like him BUT would mot acknowledge the situation or behavior out of THEIR embarrassment. But this guy brings it up.. and then CALLS her behavior out and pretty much says your hiving him a boner... and then she reacts in a coy ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not being mean‚Äù bratty behavior that screams ‚Äúwhat am i doing wrong daddy‚Äù begging to be watched... it‚Äôs very odd...and seems so normal for them to talk about and not be embarrassed by sexual things..."
sex,ffk28i3,t3_etv9qj,1580013562.0,"Hi, female perspective. It‚Äôs SO normal. She knew exactly what she was doing, and it‚Äôs really kind of messed up she did it in front of all of those people man. Especially her own dad. It was done only for the purpose of her to either see if you liked her, or 16 year old girls like to do things just to see if they can. It‚Äôs not like there is any reason for her to put sunscreen on AFTER you guys were done in the pool..

If the same thing happened with just you teens then it could have been a freaking porn situation.. no doubt no matter how embarrassed you were.. you were the most normal person in the situation, and it‚Äôs still gonna be in your spank bank for awhile. 

Also, just like everyone else says, she stayed, she liked it. If you actually like her, i would bring it up as a joke to her and ask her to the movies or something. Maybe even lower key and just to hang out? If she seems excited make plans. If she seems like she wants to but might seem intimidated (she might like you and think thats all you are after and be scared) so say something like ‚Äúwe could do whatever you want, the movies, grab food etc‚Äù so she knows you don‚Äôt just want her alone in a room.."

greysanatomy,fem4gfw,t1_fem2uet,1579239435.0,"I was just waiting for that comment. Literally nobody owes something to anyone else. Just like you said the job factor. 

I don‚Äôt actually think actors owe it to do so. I personally feel that when something is such a huge part of your career, and in return you helped make the show what it is... i think you would want to give your fans that wholesome conclusion. I feel that anytime a series i love has ended and cast members came back for a short moment (The Office: Michael Scott, Parks & Rec: Anne/Chris, Nurse Jackie: Dr. Ohara) have always felt way more complete and satisfactory. It usually makes mire sense as well for the story. People are not usually that big of a part of your life and just are never heard from again. They are still there for the big life moments. Also, it tends to make you like them even more, since you know they care about the projects they worked on, and the relationships they built from it. I do however very much understand since Killing Eve isnt even filmed in the country."
