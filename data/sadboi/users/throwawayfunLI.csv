I just didn’t want it or like it before now but I’m realizing how much of it was having a guard up, I think to protect myself. We were always intimate and never had any major issues, but I’m sure to an outsider it seemed like friends when we were outside the bedroom. Just not “ “touchy feely “  people. Which is fine too! 

But the other day we just laid on the couch and he was like why don’t you let me play with you hair ever ? I’m like idk but I was so comfortable in the moment and I really loved it .  But i think it’s because the level I trust him , and I’m seeing now I deserve that.

ptsd,eusvxpa,t3_chd90h,1564014634.0,"This made me smile too much :) it’s hurt hahah. 

I’m lucky to have a husband who has never stopped trying to make me feel the most at ease and guide me through things when it’s needed. 

Sometimes it’s as simple as him just being there or telling me he’s here for me, sometimes it’s him laying back and letting me have my space. He’s helped create an environment that is calm and safe and honestly that’s the best. 

Sometimes if I’m having a hard time, he will tell me things like “ you’re doing great babe, I know that you’re trying”. “ or I got you babe, it’s gonna be okay, you’ve worked through this everytime  and you can do this !” and Sometimes hearing those things is enough for me to take a second and try to center myself the best I can.  

If I’m having a particularly hard time , he knows it helps me to look around talk about what’s around me ( in the case of a bad flashback or intrusive thought). So sometimes he will say those things.  

Sometimes asking if I wanna talk about it, even if it’s 2 seconds or 2 hours is a nice thing ( lately I rant and talk more openly about my traumas because I’m trying to in some way work through them) 

Sometimes I feel he just rolls with it and doesn’t make me feel any worse than I already do , and that’s honestly amazing."

But while I’m the good moments I’m like “ clearly there is nothing wrong and I’m like just over reacting” but I think clearly there is something because if there really was nothing.... you  wouldn’t be like thinking about it even in the good moments. You wouldn’t even have anything to think about. 

I think for me anyway, it’s a way to put things in a perspective my brain is more comfortable with and i can work myself down, because knowing it was bad is just too hard sometimes. 

I also have this issue, because my trauma was for a such a long period of time and starting at a younger age, I think a lot of it was “normal”. That makes it hard for me too."

I understand the frustration part of having a great life now and being a happy person who loves their life and the frustration level when u see these super negative images or get thoughts in your head. 

Lately I just remind myself that it’s not defining me as person and I think/ list all the positive things that are immediately around me and in my life and I find that helps ground me a bit in the moment. Or I’ll tell someone like my husband, exactly what I’m seeing... as disturbing as it maybe. He says he doesn’t mind and wants to help and sometimes pin pointing the fear or the helplessness in that thought helps me understand it more... if that makes sense ? Then later on if it happens again I feel like it’s shorter lived and I’m like ehhh not that big of a deal, cause I’m not as scared.
