I know we're talking about suicide, but I can't ignore how I feel, if you want to die, you want to die, but put it off, get lazy about it, tell yourself it can wait, honestly you can even mark it in a calendar, like ""Hey it's you from a month ago, (write some things you think you'll want to know in the future, and talk about suicide, fuck it)"" I know that it sounds funny, but that's exactly how I feel about your situation, you would be laughing, kicking ass, having fun, I think you're a great guy just from your post alone. So just laugh at your own thoughts."
lifesucks,fqkvje1,t3_ghp4d1,1589437522.0,"I came here, because I feel suicidal, and the only thing keeping me alive, is thinking of the girl that I loved that loved me (sidenote: I abandoned her and disappeared) will probably feel betrayed if I died and my only excuse for suicide is because I got bored... LMAO, but I'm being completely serious, I lost motivation for getting better because I became a know it all who isn't curious about anything else, except for her... I just want to die, all that said, I still can't say I feel your pain, I don't even know where to begin to talk to you.

But if you can find a way to blair out the pain, you can use your music and gaming as fuel to become who you want to be. Your family and friends will find it disgusting and hideous, (I'm sorry I hate sugarcoating) but record what you like, and what you believe in, no matter how I guess chunibyo it might be. What I've learned is using what I like, to control my emotions, to understand what I learn in school, and by understand I mean remember, life becomes a lot more fun.

Also if you want friends, (I hope you really want friends, because I'm hard to keep around, and I'm super quiet around new people) just email me, I always check my emails. kingamiri2020@outlook.com
