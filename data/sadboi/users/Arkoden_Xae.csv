You may be a good person with good intentions. But you have the missfortune of being mislead by centuries of un-backed dogma cited from the literal interpretations of a book. A book written by a bunch or people reciting their clouded perceptions of witnessed events, and then hand picked by a bunch of pious zealots to further an agenda.

Showerthoughts,fnuffl8,t1_fnu13yu,1587260847.0,"Carbon dating is an exact science and is well understood. Any science is only a ""just take my word for it"" to the people who cant be bothered to read into it or verify the evidence that the science is based on. The whole point of the scientific endeavour is putting theory to the test and presenting evidence that can be verified and repeated by anyone with the tools to compare results. The reason science is peer reviewed is so that theories, processes or experiments can be verified, critiqued and countered before publication. If a scientific concept is disproven and verified via the same rigorous process due to a misinterpretation of results, flaw in the method of testing, or new understanding of the fundamental concepts, the new theory becomes the accepted science.

Without the ""just take my word for it"" science being as exact as it is we wouldn't have been able to achieve the incredible feats that we have today. Thanks to science we can not only send our technology out into space but we can land it on something as small as an asteroid (a speck of dust in relation to the scale of the solar system). We wouldnt have clocks that are so incredibly accurate that they keep a global network of devices synchronised for reliable GPS tracking and Stock Trading. We wouldnt have the understanding that it takes to be able to develop super conductors that levitate in a magnetic field or computers that utilise the fruits of quantum science to perform once unimaginable equations.

If you dont believe that carbon dating is an exact science, you are more than welcome to go and disprove it. Who knows, you might just be the next nobel prize winner in the fields of physics and archaeology.

For those who have bothered to read this far, i implore you to think critically, and I hope that you are hungry enough for knowledge to search out truth with a critical mindset instead of just discarding it offhand as 'junk science'. The science that backs Carbon dating is in fact well established."

i'm just trying to pose the questions so he can seriously consider what it is he is doing this for in the long run.

If he is gunning for the promotion because it's specifically important to him to make something of himself then sure.
