My university does have a comprehensive autism program which I’m a part of and has really helped me, especially with helping with my social skills, and meeting other neurodiverse individuals.    

As for meeting with the disability board, make sure you have copies of official diagnosis documents available, and they will be able to help you find accommodations. Make sure to also write down any questions you may have.     I’m so proud of you for entering college again. You will do great."

Because when people do this and do not wear protective gear they endanger people like me ( an essential worker), my father and boyfriend ( immunocompromised people) and countless others who are in the same position.    

I support people’s right to peacefully protest, as it’s our right as citizens to do, as outlined by our Constitution.
