Entiendo que muestras aires de superioridad pero también las personas de las que te quejas muy probablemente lo hagan cada vez que desprestigian tus palabras por pensar distinto.

Comparto totalmente tu frustración con tener una opinión distinta.

Lo único que puedo pedirte es que no hagas a otros lo que no te gusta que te hagan. Entiendes que tu postura no es la definitiva y superior y que escribir bien no hace a una persona mejor como no lo hace tener plata (o no tenerla). Sé el cambio que quieres ver en el mundo."
chile,f8rrump,t3_e1au9w,1574750416.0,"Leí muchas veces tu post y lo que entendí fue que básicamente la justicia y la dignidad no existen. Y por eso ahora tú eres alguien privilegiado mientras el resto puede tener descontento pero la vida es así y tiene que acatar? O de lo contrario derramar sangre.

Y de aquí a 50 años será lo mismo solo que una sola persona tendrá todo el poder y por lo tanto tú serías uno más de los que tendrá que acatar. Es esto lo que quisiste decir?

En realidad yo estoy de acuerdo con lo que dices, en el universo no existe la justicia y es uno de los motivos fuertes por los que odio la vida (uno de los motores de mi depresión). Pero también pienso que es posible que superemos nuestros propios instintos y dejemos atrás no solo la violencia y el odio, también el egoísmo. Supongo que eso requeriría evolucionar como humanos, como especie, y también como sociedad. Creo que podemos alcanzar un mundo más justo por medio de esa inteligencia, y dejar de lado el individualismo.

El problema que veo contigo es que efectivamente vives en una burbuja no solo física/social también mental, intelectual e ideológica. En cierta forma la enorme mayoría de las personas vivimos en burbujas relativamente limitadas pero tu burbuja en particular es pequeña. Yo tampoco comparto la mayoría de las ideas de reddit Chile ni del chileno promedio, aunque a diferencia tuya me crié en extrema pobreza en un comienzo, así que he visto el mundo desde distintos puntos de vista. El país definitivamente tiene muchas cosas mejorables y no puedes justificar la negligencia en mejorar esas cosas simplemente citando la injusticia de la naturaleza. Es como justificar a unos padres negligentes o abusadores porque la vida es así.

Quizá solo estoy respondiendo a un post extraño con un comentario aún más loco pero me despido con esta cita que me recordó a lo que comentas. Igual dejo el recordatorio que como dijo otro comentario, la justicia y dignidad efectivamente no son cosas físicas, son humanas. Y nosotros y toda nuestra sociedad somos seres humanos.

El discurso empatista del OP no solo lo he leído de personas centristas. También de personas inclinadas más fuertemente por la derecha o por la izquierda. Me parece insensato pasar cualquier llamado a la empatía como un discurso de derecha. De hecho nótese que el OP ni ha manifestado sus ideologías podría perfectamente estar más inclinado por la izquierda y apoyar el movimiento mientras aquí hablas de que le vendieron el cuento solo por tener la sensatez de querer más empatía y menos odio en el país. Está cuestionando algo mucho más básico y fundamental en la sociedad, fuera de los colores políticos. O soy muy tonto y no lo entendí bien."
chile,f8rp45r,t3_e1erx2,1574747360.0,"Comparto todo lo que has escrito. Solo faltó agregar que a los que piensan como nosotros también nos odian por 'tibios'. Admiro que hayas tenido el coraje de escribir esto así que me animaré a escrbir algo también.

Ser centrista no es empatar ni estar al medio lilteralmente, para mí es más una mentalidad que una ideología. (o eso me pasa por lurkear r/centrist). Es carecer de dogmas políticos, ser pragmático para enfrentar los problemas sociales, económicos y políticos y encontrar soluciones.

Para mí el mayor problema es que se pone a la inclinación política o la división social por encima de valores humanos mucho más fundamentales como la empatía, el respeto y la tolerancia. Cosas super básicas pero que la mayoría solo reserva para sí mismos, su familia y su tribu de personas que piensan igual. El resto son ""los malos"" y hay que deshumanizarlos y hacer todo lo que esté al alcance para reducirlos forzosamente atentando a sus derechos.

Ni si quiera son solo los extremistas los únicos que practican este odio y dejan de lado la empatía. Por lo que se puede apreciar en la calle y en las redes sociales es como si la mayoría lo hiciera. Basta con que tengas una inclinación política, un sentido de tribalismo y un círculo de personas que inciten al odio y ya eres parte del clan también. Así mismo basta con que alguien tenga una leve inclinación política hacia el polo opuesto y ya eres parte de los malos y objeto de odio. Y luego está nuestro grupo de los 'tibios de mierda' al que ningún bando parece querer por la prepotencia que significa proponer más empatía y menos odio antes de postear algo en las redes sociales o de agredir a alguien.

Autoanalizándome me doy cuenta de que yo pienso como pienso porque vivo en constante alienación a las personas, y es irónico pero eso me hace más empático con gente de la ideología y clase social que sea (aparte que he vivido con gente de plata y con pobres). Estoy casi seguro de que la mayoría de quienes incitan al odio se viven rodeando de las mismas personas, ya sea por casualidad o elección, efectivamente viviendo en un constante echo chamber y al mismo tiempo rodeándose de otras personas que también incitan al odio (dime con quien andas y te diré quien eres). Pero un párrafo es muy poco para analizar en profundidad este fenómeno y poder concluir la causa raíz de la falta de empatía en este país polarizado donde todos nos creemos los buenos pero la mayoría no duda en tirarle mierda al que no es de la tribu.

Yo no estoy chato de esto desde que comenzó el movimiento, estoy chato de esto prácticamente desde que tuve el mínimo de inteligencia para captar lo que era la política y me di cuenta de lo mucho que se odian las personas entre sí. Es como si viviéramos en una constante mentira de respeto y tolerancia, la única diferencia en un estallido social es que la gente deja libres sus instintos e impulsos mostrando su verdadera cara. De ahí nació mi interés en el centrismo y por eso lo veo más como mi filosofía de vida que como el conjunto de mis ideologías."

chile,f8mdiwo,t3_e130zm,1574630367.0,"¿Por qué las mujeres se suicidan menos? Es porque cuando dan señales siempre hay más gente que salte a apoyarlas (aunque sea con  otras intenciones detrás)? O es por el prejuicio que hay alrededor de que un hombre tenga sentimientos o muestre debilidad y lo poco que se toma en serio la salud mental de un hombre?

Yo siempre he pensado que el suicidio solo es una consecuencia de la supervivencia del más apto o el más fuerte. Algunos somos muy débiles para esta sociedad; para su cultura, sus estándares sociales, sus expectativas, las expectativas del sexo opuesto (o el que te atraiga), el sistema y el modelo económico, la competencia laboral, la dificultad de oportunidades, la falta de apoyo emocional, los trastornos mentales, etc. Los menos aptos para el mundo terminan filtrándose ellos mismos por el colador del suicidio siempre presente.

Y es algo super transversal porque gente rica y pobre se suicida por igual. Si buscas los índices puedes observar a muchos países ricos y también países con alta igualdad económica que tienen tasas de suicidio más altas que Chile (como Japón, Corea del Sur o hasta Finlandia).

Tenemos muchos números, muchas tablas e información pero está la pregunta ¿por qué se suicida la gente? Qué es lo que hace a un país como Japón tener una tasa tan alta de suicidio que no parece que vaya a bajar? ¿Por qué en Chile los suicidios permanecen en aumento constante? ¿Y por qué en casi todo el mundo se suicidan más hombres que mujeres?"

Como dijo la otra persona en este comentario, la gente pobre crece sin recibir ninguna empatía de la gente de plata y se acostumbran al odio. También pasa al revés y personas como tú están como están porque nunca recibieron ninguna empatía de los otros. Con cosas como cobrarte peaje en las barricadas o lincharte por pensar distinto lo único que logran es distanciar más a las personas.

No hace falta ser buda o ser de fierro sin emociones para poder tener algo de empatía hacia todos y empezar a ponerse en el lugar de los demás, no importa si tienen plata o si son clase media pobre. Yo tengo una depresión horrible y no dejo que eso me haga odiar a nadie.

Another thing where I'm very different from you is that I'm an extremely emotional person. I'm an INFP and while depression sucks most of my ability to feel pleasure or hapiness, I still experience very strong emotions. I'm somewhat grateful for that even if the emotion I feel the most is sadness, you could say I'm proud of my sadness as it makes me feel human, it connects my soul to the world, to art, to people.

Platforming is always more enjoyable in 3rd person, as is any kind of movement. The only exception is racing games but even then I prefer 3rs person most of the time as I favor better control over the visual experience.

A good 3rd person camera allows me to have a better grasp of the world around me and thus I would argue it makes the experience even more immersive. It also allows better control, again.

The world is a very cruel place but for every cruel person there's a cruel reality they had to live or are still living. Some people are beyond hope and might never go back to recover but I would always forgive them were they be able to change.

A lot of time what truly changes people is pain. Pain can either turn you into a more loving and kind person or make you hate the world even more. But when you are able to experience both a lot of pain and some genuine love, you'll eventually want to push yourself towards becoming a better person. The first time you try you'll only have a rough idea of what a good person is like but with each painful experience, with every bad person you meet or good person you learn from, you get a better sense of where you should go.

It's okay hating on the world. There isn't really much to love about the world, its people and society. The youth is often responsible for a lot of what's wrong in this world, they don't know the meaning of love or pain so they can't do any better. They've got no empathy for people who do know pain, they've got no respect or appreciation for people who do know how to love.

And they can change, just like you. You might not even want to change now but the path is there whenever you feel like taking it. There's good people in the world if you're willing to find them."

You already know this but talk is cheap. I've been with someone in the past who I cared for like no one else and she always told me how much she loved me and how much she wanted to be with me for a very long time or how serious she was with me. It only lasted 4 months and a bit more and she broke up when I was completely invested in her.

But you know what, she's the one missing out, because she's also someone who's been in the kind of relationships you were into, and at some point she'll realize most people don't really love her. I'm sure all these guys are also missing out for not having truly appreciated and cared about you. They were the wrong people and you deserve more.

So please believe in your value. I also feel like I'm just a piece of trash no one finds appealing enough to stay as it's always the other person who breaks up, usually after I'm no longer useful.

relationships,f4ja2hg,t3_dkn06g,1571615690.0,"You both need to make drastic changes to your lifestyles and both need to work on it together. It can be an exercise routine, engaging in social events of any kind and make some friends (even if you will struggle to be around people at first), replacing bad habits with good ones, etc. The important part is that both need to do changes otherwise one of you will be keeping the other back from progress.

Both you and your boyfriend need to focus on your own faults as well. If one of you isn't making personal progress then again the relationship might get in the way of recovery. Keep doing therapy but if therapy isn't helping much you can always try a different professional. If you can find a better job or lifestyle that can also help a lot in your recovery.

This is just my advice but I think sticking together is a good thing, but you have to talk about it and agree to work towards recovery. If your bf doesn't comply after a while you might need to talk about it again. A breakup should be a last resort if you see he isn't going anywhere while you are making progress alone. Set healthy boundaries with one another so that none of you add to the other one's depression (for example deciding when it's not ok to express your issues, or when you can not be there for the other person), you can google some good information about boundaries in depressive people and I think some professionals can also help out with that.

You said you're a very logical person. You want to live your life based on reason. This is why you know this person is no good for you.

Initial attraction only last so much and after that your rational side will take back control and you'll realize this isn't what you wanted.

Love is a choice. Stick to your thoughts and your true feelings. Don't trust the chemistry. He does not ""complete"" you, it's just your mind playing tricks.

relationships,f3m723x,t3_dhasgp,1570984012.0,"I think ideally in a relationship no one should hate their partner's hobbies. It means hating on their partner enjoying what they do. Love is about wanting the other person to be happy and encouraging them to do what makes them happy.

There are exceptions to that, when what makes them ""happy"" is in fact harmful, like drugs. But do you think some anime tiddies are doing harm to him?

And this is where it becomes a matter of values as someone else said. What he sees as a simple hobby you view as a morally offensive or wrong thing. I think there's something fundamentally wrong in that clash of views, it's like if my partner hated the fact I'm an atheist.

You two either work on dealing with your different views on the hobby or you break up. But wanting him out of his hobby.. I don't think that's what I would do to a loved one.

That's just my opinion, I'm a very idealist INFP btw. And I don't actively look for games with tiddies and over sexualization but a lot of the games and stuff I like do have that content, because that's just Japan for you, and I don't mind it."

depression,f3gnb7p,t3_dgzy07,1570913153.0,"From what I've read I don't believe in the idea of a 'chemical imbalance' being the root of depression. In fact depression almost never has a single root cause. I'd say a chemical imbalance is more of a consequence, which then becomes a cause in a vicious cycle.

For example if you don't get enough sunlight, your serotonin levels go down, it will impact your mood and lifestyle, you might go outside less often, getting even less sunlight and thus lowering your serotonin levels even further. But there's always preceding reasons to get to that imbalance in the first place.

The thing with depression is the lower you fall in the pit, the more imbalanced the chemicals in your brain are. But there's far more issues than just neurotransmitters/hormone levels, like your thoughts, your habits, the way your brain gets used to different situations and feelings, etc. Depression is a mess that affects the whole way your brain works and most of the consequences further empower depression. Medication and exercise are good to deal with the chemicals but there's far more work needed to be done to get rid of depression, depending on how deep you are into it."

Some people lack a supporting family as well, that leaves them really lackiing in the love and belonging set of needs. Some of us struggle a lot to make friends and can barely keep any bond with them. Things like that usually make having a good partner all the more important. Not to mention sex which is also a human need for most of our population. And most of us link it to an emotional connection and a relationship.

I think what really makes love and company different than other human needs is that they have to be provided by other people, you can't just meet those needs yourself, like eating or securing a house. That doesn't mean we should just get used to being lonely, we can't neglect human needs and sustained loneliness is in fact unhealthy. We're all different in the end though."

What you learn from these experiences is to take relationships more slowly and don't dream big even if your partner does. Put effort into the relationship? Sure. But be mindful of the way the relationship evolves. Be cautious if the other person is moving too fast and some of the things they say aren't very rational, when they wake up they realize it was their own fantasy, in reality it's just chemicals tricking their mind.

BreakUps,f3bljyr,t3_dgg9d4,1570812718.0,"The right answer is: it doesn't matter.

I know having spent years in the relationship he's already a part of you, and a part that won't simply go away, in fact he might never go away from deep inside your heart. But the feelings and the pain can go. However for that to happen you really need to stop checking on his life and thinking about him. Stop contact with him if there's still any, and stop listening to that particular song. I know this is extremely tough to digest and it's painful to think about it but please believe me and have hope. I also believe in you and if you're going through depression you already have a lot of potential, since depression steals a lot of our best features, as a person and as a partner.

So don't be blaming yourself or thinking she's the ""better girl"". You are the better girl in your own way that he wasn't able to appreciate. I've been with depressed people and am currently in depression and I can tell you depression requires effort from both ways. You might have made mistakes but you can learn from them and learn to keep depression from getting in the way of your relationships and communication. But he also made mistakes by not knowing how to better handle your depression and support you. Love isn't just about having fun, it's also about support.

He was clearly trying to move on from the beginning that's why he changed jobs, and he's making progress with moving on. You should do the same. I know breakups are extremely hard on depressed people but you can move on as well. Learn from your mistakes and other people's mistakes. Try to focus on fighting depression one step at a time. Learn to cope with it and handle it better so you can have a healthier future relationship. And don't go looking for someone to fill the void or help you move on (like your ex probably did). If someone appears along the way then let it happen but don't get into the mindset that you need someone to feel better right now.

Don't give up. The pain will go away. Depression will go away as well. Fight, love yourself. If you need to vent or just talk about your depression don't hesitate to DM me, as depression is something I've learned a lot about and am willing to support anyone going through it (I'm not a therapist though! But sincere support does wonders sometimes). Also went through really harsh breakups in the past."
