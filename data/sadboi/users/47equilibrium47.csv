Meditation,fofcf5i,t1_fof556n,1587732626.0,"The thing that really helped me was the meditation where you focus on sounds. 

So basically, you get out of your house, just go on some loud public place where you can sit. And just close your eyes and focus on every single sound. You hear the drill, focus on that, now you hear a child crying - focus on that, police car passing by? focus on that. 

So basically the thing is that you should make your brain tired so it can be focused. As we know, the person with ADD has really high activity in brain and the goal is to make him tired. 

Just jump from sound to sound, as fast as you can.

Also, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yph9VpjW6gg) helped me out to understand more about different types of meditations."

No jokes tho, try to keep yourself busy and tired during this quarantine time. Try to workout and take a cold showers. That can make you more motivated and tired at same time. Also try to stay away from social media as much as possible. 

And I'd like to say that you have to take a look inside of your mind and realize what's the thing that keeps you returning to a porn except addiction, duh.

In example, for me it's the fact that I'm lonely and I'm lacking any interaction with other human beings, so I'm trying to escape into a different world by going back to porn. That little hit of dopamine makes me satisfied for 5 minutes, then it gets worse.
