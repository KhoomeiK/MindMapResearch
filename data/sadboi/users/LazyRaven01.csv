I draw to cope. I'm pretty good at it with the sheer practice I get. Some of my best work was done when I was in a really dark (or really good!) place. The problem here being that pictures drawn in frustration or while crying *remind* me of the situations that made me that way, so I usually ship them off to others. Though the nice thing is that pictures don't judge.

Art and sports are great for this. Go for a walk. Read a book. Hell, write a book! Books don't judge either, and it can really help to write down what you're feeling.

And even if none of that works, there are millions of things you can do to take your mind off of things. And I believe you'll find one that makes you happy sooner or later."

I know a lot of fairly introverted people, and while they're a great help when you need to get to the bottom of a problem or just sort your thoughts in what distantly resembles order, you don't really get a whole lot of hugs. My teachers hug me more than my friends or family.

I also feel like I'm always the one initiating them. Like maybe they don't like hugs and I'm just bothering them, but they think it'd be rude to turn someone down for something relatively harmless."

Don't worry, though, my guys were basically promoted to characters the second this player showed interest, and I've already ran them through a few encounters with different individuals.

Thank you for letting me know, I have no frame of reference for time measurements or evolution. I struggle organising my day, let alone 5k years. But this should help *a lot.*

The video will a great help, though I mostly ran with a slightly looser form of what you usually see in fiction, it'll be nice to see if I'm not forgetting something major that someone who actually knows what they're talking about would never forget.

I'm going to say something mean and then something nice here.

The system we play is a Witcher-esque medieval fantasy setting. My aliens are entirely homebrew and if my whole world wasn't just as homebrew, they'd be very out of place. Unfortunately, there are no MegaCorpy associatios suitable for this kind of thing.

That being said, the player and the alien are getting along quite well so far, despite the worlds of difference. There is a termination plot underway despite the lack of MegaCorps (Perks of a fantasy setting: Active gods who can want this intruder dead). (Might have a thing to do with the aliens being partially parasitic. The two are literaly stuck together for the time being. Makes for some great drama.)

The PC has even named the alien, who was suitably confused by this ""Strange human custom,"" but so far plays along and actually responds to the name. Normally, it'd be too proud, but I let it slide for the sheer hilarity of having an alien named Kevin.

Thanks for the input, it certainly sparked ideas if nothing else!"

worldbuilding,fjy2t4s,t1_fjxz6f8,1583688689.0,"Good idea, I'll take a look into it. As I said, the aliens have a hive-like social structure. It used to be a hive-mind, but bits have broken off over time. They are also fairly scattered, so I'd assume most potential cultures would be quite diverse and individualistic in the parts where they broke off and basically nonexistent in the parts where that wasn't the case? I'll try to take a look at their evolutionary history, granted my world is quite young and while a shapeshifting species might evolve faster due to their natural instability, there's the whole hive-mind thing holding them back intelectually. I wonder, is 5 thousand years enough for some major changes, accounting for ""divine intervention?""

And FYI, I run a setting that the rulebook advertises as Witcher-esque medieval fantasy. My sci-fi is Spelljamer-level soft.
