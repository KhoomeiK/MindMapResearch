PokemonSunMoon,fqwgrpa,t1_fqwfkiv,1589703851.0,"I really appreciate the response. I think i just figured it out though. Im using a quagsire with yawn, water gun, and earthquake and golduck with role play. I start with quagsire and use yawn. I then switch to golduck. After graveler falls asleep i use role play to figure out the ability. Then i switch back to quagsire immediately. Then i use water gun if graveler has magnet pull or earthquake if it has sturdy to lower hp. I either restore health or pp while i wait for graveler to call or just try to use another adrenaline orb so im not wasting any items. Theres no way for graveler to explode and i know what each graveler’s ability is this way. So far it’s working great. Im trying it out right now. I have a bunch of leppa berries and rotom pp restores too so i can last a long time. Thanks again so much for responding!"

unpopularopinion,fqqn7f9,t1_fqqmxw5,1589568474.0,I love that! Thats a fantastic way to imagine what happened.
unpopularopinion,fqqi6f5,t1_fqqg6wv,1589565943.0,I get that what you’re saying but i really didnt mean that Joaquin had to go crazy with plans and actions. I meant the mannerisms of Heath we’re quintessential Joker to me. The way heath carried himself and could terrify and make you laugh at the same time was what I meant. But you’re right that theyre not comparable in that Heaths joker was more established and Joaquin’s was a couple days old
unpopularopinion,fqqhp2f,t1_fqqfvg0,1589565701.0,My understanding was that used they used “The Killing Joke” as the main inspiration for the script and its very similar the two stories if you compare them side by side. I do agree that the script has Scorsese influences because he was a uncredited producer if im not mistaken. Its more than fair to say its not comparable Heath and Joaquin’s portrayals. Maybe if they did a Sequel and showed show Joker more developed id have a different opinion of Joaquin but i just didnt like it so far. But i appreciate the respectful discourse. Thank you for the insight.

mentalhealth,fq9b7dt,t1_fq9ax5a,1589192248.0,Ive taken antipsychotics and ssris and had horrible reactions to both and my experience is that the side effects get worse the longer you’re on it especially if they’re starting this early. Like i said im not a doc but ive taken medications for many years. Maybe finding something else to counter act the panic attacks could help but it doesnt make sense to me to take that risk. Have you been diagnosed with add or adhd?
mentalhealth,fq9a1ym,t3_ghkcad,1589191050.0,Im not a doc but that definitely doesn’t sound normal. Does your doc know how bad things are with this medication and still want to keep you on this regiment? Because there are many other medications out there you can try and that many panic attacks is debilitating. If they just want you to power through it I would consider finding a new doc. I really hope you find something that helps.

mentalillness,fphvpo7,t1_fphopqi,1588628681.0,TD normally develops after long term use from my understanding. So I’d be surprised if it was that. Did you tell your doc about the anxiety? Everyone has different physiologies so what works for one person with your same issues may not work well for you unfortunately. It sucks but it really is a shot in the dark and hope something hits kind of method for figuring out the right medication. Just make sure you’re paying attention to what you’re feeling when taking new medications and if you have someone in your life who can gauge how you’re doing too is very helpful. If you have any extreme reactions try to let your doctor know asap so they can tell you how to safely get off it or do what they think is going to keep you safe. I hope you find a good fit and that things get more manageable.

The healthiest thing is to find out why you matter to yourself. Im still learning how to do that so I’m not the best resource on how to figure that out but I genuinely believe thats how you find happiness. I believe thats how you can have healthy and happy relationships. I think that finding your purpose and passion/s is also how you keep going. If you wanna talk more you can personal message me.

I think one thing that could help is focusing on a passion. I know its incredibly hard to do that in the state you’re in, so it’s totally understandable if you cant do that right now. I know im having a horrible time focusing on mine. If you have a good support group of friends or a good friend you can talk to, thats another good way to cope with these feelings. If you dont have that im happy to listen or talk with you time you need. Theres a YouTube channel called “Therapy in a nutshell” that i learned about in a psych ward recently thats made by a professional and can teach a lot of great skills based on DBT and CBT therapy. I know some ways to get individual professional help if you’re interested too. NAMI is another great organization for learning skills and finding help. I hope this helps at all and that you find the path that can help bring you peace and happiness. You are worthy of love, happiness, and health. Im here for you anytime want. Please be safe and know its not weak or cowardly to not kill yourself. Its incredibly strong and caring that you want to live for the people you care about, but learning how to live for yourself is what truly matters. Take care."

Im not telling you to compare yourself to her but just know its possible to be successful in the field you want to be in with mental illness. I thinks its truly wonderful that you’re pursuing becoming a therapist. You have the potential to have incredible insight into what people are dealing with, due to your own personal experience with mental illness. It makes it a lot easier to trust and take advice from someone who actually has felt and experienced what they’re going through. I think finding professional therapists at your school or other practices to talk to about advice about becoming a therapist could help you build confidence. Idk if its possible but also seeing if you can sit in and shadow a therapist’s session. Im not sure thats not possible but i wouldn’t care if it was my session you were sitting in on. I know its hard for you but try responding to someone on these threads. When you come from a place of love and understanding, people are very thankful that you reached out when you didn’t have to and im sure you have some great knowledge from school and personal experience that you could share that could really help.
