AskReddit,erzzz2r,t1_erzf5n9,1561460433.0,The cantaloupe thing is actually pretty common. We had a 20 pound hulking beast when I was a small child who once ripped apart a cantaloupe when we went out for an afternoon. I saw someone else mention cats and cantaloupe a while ago and looked into it. Theory is that it smells like meat to them.
OCD,ermpmoz,t1_erl0tec,1561033243.0,FUCKING ME TOO. as I'm actively talking to a cute girl. Extremely homophobic of my brain to be pulling this shit during pride month smh
AskReddit,erdixwr,t1_erdco91,1560743610.0,"I had the same exact experience when I was on lithium. I was a fat, drooling zombie, and my doctor would only prescribe topamax to help combine the weight gain, which made me straight up stupid. Only difference is I turned out to actually not be bipolar at all and I was on it for no fucking reason lmao"
AskReddit,erdgif3,t1_erd7rur,1560741257.0,"I work in a kennel and I really, really hate it when a dog's feeding instructions say something like ""4 cups free feed"" and it's like...a morbidly obese staffordshire bull terrier who eats it all within 5 minutes. And the 'free feed' instruction suggests his owners top his bowl off throughout the day. But we're not a vet's office so we can't tell people to not fucking do that, not they would even listen anyway."
AskReddit,erdg0ac,t1_erddbwe,1560740789.0,For me it was when I was hospitalized as a teen. Parents brought clothes for me after I was there for more than a couple of days. They absolutely reeked of stale smoke. The realization humiliated me.
torties,er0c77k,t3_bzvitc,1560414337.0,"Have you gotten an estimate on her age? She looks maybe 4-6 weeks to me, but her eyes are also starting to lose their baby color so she may just be a runty 8ish week old (my younger tortie was the runt and looked ~8wks at 3 months). She's going to be so gorgeous!!"
BPD,eqve8cg,t3_bzequr,1560344201.0,"Man, all of my relationships ended with me being abused and manipulated. My last ex specifically preyed on women with BPD trapped me with suicide threats and false promises and a very very thick layer of manipulation, and I could only actually leave after I found out he cheated on me."
mildlyinteresting,eqbunj3,t1_eqbtdy3,1559956874.0,"Yeah they're a thing all around NJ, I started seeing them up where I am about 10-15 years ago. They were in NYC first according to friends who lived there at the time so I always assumed it was some sort of camouflage thing."
AskReddit,epo6njt,t1_epnbf6t,1559339270.0,"Worked at an indie coffee shop and I was trained to give a canned answer about this when people ordered a macchiato to avoid miscommunication and customer bullshit. There are two different drinks that can be called a macchiato. A caffe macchiato is what you just described, and a latte macchiato is the opposite, a lot of milk with a shot of espresso added to it.  Starbucks serves a latte macchiato but most other places serve caffe macchiato."
