My kid's teacher thinks watching tv causes anxiety. So does her doctor. It's obnoxious. My kid does have social anxiety and I almost fell for the nonsense. TV is usually something that distracts her enough to calm down and gives her something easy to talk about with other kids. It has done nothing but help her. We went through that restricting electronics mess, it did nothing positive. Only negative. My kid's anxiety is probably mostly genetic. She also had severe colic as a baby and overly attached to me so seperation anxiety is an issue sometimes. None of that has to do with too much Disney channel or Minecraft."
schizophrenia,fpq81zn,t3_fe6c0o,1588817045.0,"Yes. It can be done. There will be challenges but it helps to be with someone who understands what you are going through. My husband has diagnosed schizophrenia and i have unspecified psychotic episodes, possibly schizoaffective. Every man I was with before him either treated me like a child to take care of or like a loser that would never be good enough. My husband never had a relationship before me. We have been married 7 years, and we have a 6 year old daughter. All 3 of us are in therapy but not for family issues. My daughter has sepration anxiety about going to school but that is her only issue. My therapy sucks I just go to basically be monitored for backslides. My daughters is pretty helpful  because she can leave class to go there if she feels overwhelmed. I used the same type of support when I was in school.

Anyway this is the healthiest relationship I have ever had with anyone, romantic or otherwise. I wouldn't have been able to build a life with anyone else.
Hope this helps."
