I’d do absolutely anything to stop hurting the few that care, and try to help. I completely understand how hard it is to speak up because you don’t want to be perceived as weak, but it’s the only thing you can do to help yourself, which will also help make things easier in your relationships. Make an appointment. Get up out of bed and show yourself that you want to get better, or at least get on the right track. Go talk to someone. Let them know that you can’t live like this much longer and that you’re holding onto pretty much nothing at this point. I haven’t seen a doctor yet, but i’m booking the appointment tomorrow. I’ll keep you updated."

It’s like all of us are zombies when we’re on medication. I just recently stopped taking mine because it was only effecting me negatively and I still was depressed/suicidal/manic. I wish I could tell you how it feels living like this, but I cant even come close to describing the emptiness. Be there for your friend. Be patient. Be kind. Feeling like this may make him/her lash out, or push you away, but sometimes all we need is someone there telling us they aren’t going to leave. When people get into our lives they start to see how absolutely broken we are then they can’t handle it. I’d do anything to take your friends pain away.
