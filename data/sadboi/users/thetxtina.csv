For me, I wrung learning out of this: not ""what could I have done,"" but ""what behavior pattern is my abuser having here, and can these behavior patterns help me recognize toxicity in others"". Also ""what behaviors might stop this kind of attack in its place?""

Sadly I'm still figuring out the last one after 30 years. Currently I'm landing on: 

1. look for Gaslight and DARVO behavior. With those people, start keeping evidence. Notes in conversations, emails, recordings, whatever. This helps you with trusting your own memory and supporting your own credibility.
2. Do not directly engage these abusers. Avoid where possible; otherwise use grey rock, and never ever ever be alone with them, in person or on the phone.
3. If someone brings you stories of their lies about you, and that this party's opinion matters to you THEN share your evidence, and explain the concept of DARVO and warm them about that being the abuser's likely next tactic. Don't necessarily expect those people to believe you; some flying monkeys will support an abuser to a shocking degree, possibly out of a desire to avoid conflict, and definitely never realizing how unhealthy their enablement is. 
You won't win every one of those conversations, but those people really identify themselves as people to remove from your life.

Parting thought: Flying monkeys and abusers are toxic and therefore are entitled to nothing from you. This goes double for family, who should be protective of us when we are most vulnerable."
