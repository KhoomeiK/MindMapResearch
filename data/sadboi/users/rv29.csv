Schizoid,fr36r3d,t1_fr2doej,1589851072.0,"Re schizophrenia? While not impossible, very unlikely. It's too early for that, especially if there are no cases of close relatives. 

It definitely means something. At 15, the brain gets flooded with hormones and basically rewires itself. Dealing with it can be very difficult and take a couple of years. Without knowing any details, this is the most likely explanation for the changes you noticed. That does not make it less important. You deserve support, to be heard and to be taken seriously if something troubles you. 

It could be a personality disorder taking hold (here the age fits). It could be depression."
Schizoid,fr0kg5n,t3_glsxpc,1589798806.0,"Not really. Schizophrenia (and the prodromal phase) is something that changes a personality over a relatively short period of time, while a personality disorder usually is a part of someone from adolescence on. One sign that doctors look for when diagnosing schizophrenia is a sudden loss of perfomance during the early-mid twenties. 

Flat affect and avolition can be really hard, but the regression of a person with schizophrenia is in a different ballpark. You would definitely notice a difference if someone with spd shows negative symptoms. 

My opinion on the difference is that spd is almost exclusively caused by external factors and schizophrenia seems to be mostly a genetics thing.

depressionregimens,ffhnk3n,t3_etgrzz,1579943993.0,"Most of the therapeutic SAD lamps are borderline scam. The physics of light therapy:

1. SAD lamp light is ordinary light. There is no such thing as medical grade light. The bulbs/tubes/LEDs in the advertised lamps are the same as in your everyday lamp. 

2. Melanopsin is excited most by light at 480nm (blue). You want a lamp that emits a lot of light around that frequency. 

3. The best way is to look at the spectrum of the lamp. Here is an example: https://www.heise.de/ct/imgs/04/2/6/4/1/3/1/2/PhilipsGU10Farbtemperatur_gon_IG-e0e5e1ae487bb1af.jpeg The blue one would be a good fit because of the peak around 480.

4. If that is too technical, generally speaking you want 7000K+ fluorescent tubes (skywhite) or cold white LEDs. 

5. 90% of the sold lamps are way too small. They are rated 10000 lux when the light hits your eyes from the front at a distance of 30cm. Light intensity falls off with distance squared, so at a more realistic 60cm you have 2500 lux left. Still looking directly at it. Unless you want to spend an hour every day with a screen in front of your head, you need to go big. 

6. My recommendation : build it yourself. 6x36W osram 880 tubes (8000K) do a way better job than a therapy lamp five times as expensive.

7. If you want to buy one, get the brightest,  coldest lamp you can find. It doesn't have to be a therapy lamp. Try to find the data sheet and look at the light spectrum. 

8. Household lamps don't emit uv radiation, no filter necessary. 

9. Do not use LEDs without a diffuser (screen)."

gamedev,eq8o3ft,t1_eq6qcie,1559870495.0,"Thanks for the explanation. I'm still not convinced. But it has been a while, I might have to read up on it a bit. 

I see elastic collisions through the model of a crystal lattice with atoms connected via springs. If you apply force on one side (floor), the springs compress and decompress which leads to a bounce. There is no loss in motion energy, it just reverses direction. 

That doesn't happen at the same time, you get phonons that travel through the lattice, reflect on boundaries and create sound waves. 

The bounce of rubber balls is because of entropic forces of polymer chains, but I think in the end the same results show. With enough force you can have permanent inelastic deformations too, ripping apart the chains and destroying the ball. I'd like to stay with crystals. 

Now if you apply enough force, the springs between the atoms rip and chunks of the crystal glide along defects. You get a inelastic permanent deformation and a loss of motion energy - a loss of bounce height. 

In real objects it's a mix of the two. The tougher your springs, the higher the share of inelastic deformations. 

Now I think I misunderstood 'rigid' (sorry not a native speaker) . With rigid I don't mean 100% elastic, but unbreakable sticks instead of springs. No displacement from equilibrium position means no sound, no bounce and no deformation (unrealistic of course). In that case I see heat as the only possible way where the motion energy could go. 

I love how game development often leads into physics. :)"
gamedev,eq5c3rj,t1_eq4m8g4,1559797334.0,"The difference is in the collision type, elastic or inelastic. The higher the mass, the higher the share of inelastic deformations. 

A 100% rigid floor and object would, I think, lead to no bounce at all and no deformation but a dissipation of energy into heat. You need a reversible deformation for a bounce. 

So the most realistic depiction of a high mass solid-solid collision would include a cracked/dented/shattered floor or object."
