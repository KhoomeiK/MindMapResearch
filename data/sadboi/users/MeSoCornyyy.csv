I met him when I was 18 and I'm about to turn 30. My only experience of being alone was when I was a teenager. It's so fucking hard sometimes. I've never been so lonely. 

We got this, my friend. It fucking sucks but we got this. We will look back on these times in a few years and see it as a turning point. The future has so much more in store for us.

self,euatui7,t3_cflzyk,1563631940.0,"I've been there more times than I'd like to admit. Losing a job and not having income really can weigh on every decision you make. I'm sorry you are struggling with it right now. There is no shame in canceling a nail appointment because of finances. If anything, that shows how you are trying to change your habits to better suit your needs. That is strength. If you really want to spend the day with your sister, maybe explain the situation to her. You two can go hang out at a park/ beach or maybe she can cover your nail date while you're getting back on your feet. It can hurt to show some vulnerability to someone close to you, but it can also open up new connections with the people that are closest to you. Last time I lost my job, my friends would show up and take me out to dinner during my darkest times. That really saved me. Now that I've found the new job, I'm buying them dinners left and right out of appreciation for them. Our relationship is stronger than ever because of that give and take. I'm rooting for you. I hope you find that next financial stepping stone in life soon. Then you can get your nails did, your hurr done up, and get that massage at the spa that you deserve. That could be right around the corner. Keep your chin up and know that these financial hardships are totally temporary. You got this gurl."

I truly hope you find happiness within your own life. Hopefully the happiness you bring to your family and friend will spark this joy. Depression is a bitch.

self,euaooq1,t3_cfl902,1563627426.0,"Parents are the hardest relationships to deal with when they are toxic people. They created you. They shaped you. They were your world when you were a kid. Of course it is hard to deal with their negativity when you have this bond. Your feelings are 100% justified in this scenario. Sometimes people go downhill and there is nothing you can do except protect yourself from their toxic behavior. I think you have the right idea. Pick up the pieces that you cherish, and move on with your life. An apartment away from your family will be like a breath of fresh air. You can build your own life and avoid all of the things your mother did to cause this resentment. As for the BPD, get the treatment you deserve. A good doctor and some therapy might change your whole outlook on life. You deserve that kind of support. We don't get to choose the problems our genetics bestow on us, but we can sure take control of them. You deserve that control and the happiness that comes from it. It's unfortunate that your mother doesn't seem to be going down that route. Take it as a life lesson and set yourself up to never become that person. In the end, you may find that you need to cut contact with her for you're own happiness. That is your choice and it is ok to choose that option. In the end, you have to do whatever it is that will make you happy. This could be moving, cutting ties, and never looking back. It could also be getting treatment, forgiving your mother, and building a better relationship with her. Only you will know the answer after a lot of thought and planning. No matter what, always put yourself first. Your happiness should always be the #1 priority. If you want to chat, send me a DM.  I'll be here."
