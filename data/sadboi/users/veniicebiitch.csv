Their chemistry as a group and traits that they have, such as humbleness and genuineness, has also attracted tons of people like myself. Lastly, of course it‚Äôs their talent. Their rap line is one of the best in K-pop at the moment."

- I often feel pretty lonely, even in a group. But once I feel accepted and comfortable, I act pretty goofy and talk a lot. This doesn‚Äôt happen as much as it used to, though. I‚Äôm usually standoffish and tense.
- I absorb people‚Äôs emotions a lot and can get overwhelmed
- I often take small criticisms or accidental incidents of someone ignoring me as proof for them not liking me, I get very overwhelmed by that
- I don‚Äôt like conflict, but I hate having to shove down my true feelings and opinions to avoid arguments
- Sometimes I feel energized by spending time with friends, sometimes I‚Äôm exhausted. Usually I only get energized if I spend time with one person or a small group of people that I like.
- I like to observe people and take in what‚Äôs going on.
- My sense of humor is pretty weird and I find myself constantly giggling for small reasons, and when I tell a joke or funny story I can barely start it without laughing.
- I like to boost people up and be optimistic for others, however I don‚Äôt really do that for myself.
- I like working in groups, but if things get messed up or it isn‚Äôt the way I imagined it to be I can get a bit frustrated. Not openly, though. Just kinda bitter.
- I‚Äôm very clingy towards people I love and tend to overshare with them, I ‚Äúword vomit‚Äù a lot and info dump on people that I‚Äôm comfortable with and love"
