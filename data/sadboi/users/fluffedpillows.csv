Anywho, no there won't be any way to achieve the same effect without drugs. You can put in a ton of effort into building habits and structure that may eventually cause similar benefits, along with stuff like exercise and meditation and proper nutrition. Youd likely need the help of a therapist if youre dealing with ADHD though. It's reallyyyy hard to self regulate with that kind of discipline. 

You may be interested in L-tyrosine, it serves as a precursor to norepinephrine and helps your body produce more. 

Besides that, Id say just go ahead and try using the (pseudo)ephedrine like a prescription. Just remember to not increase the dose even if you start to feel less effects. You can also find levomethamphetamine over the counter which is selective for norepinephrine. Might be worth a try. It's in vicks nasal inhalers. (It has no abuse potential, nothing like Dextro-meth) 

Good luck! üôè


I found this researching ephedrine, in case youre wondering why Im responding to a 4-month old post lol


But keep in mind that these drugs arent altering how much norepinephrine is in your body, theyre only changing the way your receptors interact with it. If these drugs help, it isn't necessarily evidence that your NE is too low- It's evidence that your brain doesn't release it properly. Although your levels may be too low like you said, of course. 

Also, the ADHD medication strattera is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. If you go the prescription route, that one may be of interest. Shouldnt have many side effects compared to every other ADHD med"
