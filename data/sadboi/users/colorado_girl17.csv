BorderlinePDisorder,f6plb2y,t3_dsiaoc,1573058860.0,"I felt like this a lot in my past relationship too and it made me feel absolutely worthless, but youâ€™re not, I promise. Like some people said, it might not have been his idea. 

Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re going through this! I remember this feeling and feeling like I was out of control and unloved and unworthy of his love. I always compared our relationship to his past relationships and it drove me NUTS. 

I know itâ€™s so difficult to not compare, but just try. Sit down and talk to him and tell him exactly how you feel. No offense to any males, but they donâ€™t always think outside the box like us and he might not even know what he is doing is hurting you.
