Also, if you didn't pay part of my wage, you would be paying more for your meals and drinks anyway...because if my base wage goes up and my employer runs a restaurant or bar, how do you think they are going to make up the shortfall? Restaurants pay their operating cost with sales from products you buy. If your bill is 30 dollars, and you're tipping 20%, that's 6 dollars. If my pay as a server were 2 dollars, and suddenly it's 12, or 15, my wage has increased sevenfold. Do you think a 20% increase in price across the board seems reasonable? Because it would probably be more. Now, for your involvement, my pay has gone from the maybe 35-45 an hour on a busy Friday to 15. Or 12. Or 10. 

I'm also keenly aware than many of you would use this as an excuse not to tip, because it would no longer be an expected part of the interaction...which means my base pay is now my pay, and you've turned most people I know out of a viable career. Maybe don't help me out without asking, and just pay the few dollars."
