She wanted me to have long hair, it long, I would say nearly a meter when not more. She threw things at me and such things. She never talked to me, but when, she only came and said how beautiful and smart she was, I should be like her. Or compared me always to others. When I was younger, she showed us videos of kids that get beaten up so badly, that they throw up or bleed hard. It escalated, when I was sick, she made my morning as painful as possible and said, that when I'm back from she would kill me.

He quickly got to the drivers seat and pressed down the breaks and pulled this thing to stop the car from rolling down. Later my father got back, looked a bit confused and got back into the car.
