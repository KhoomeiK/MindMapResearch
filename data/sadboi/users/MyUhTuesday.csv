It's important you feel safe and don't have your boundaries pushed. But his needs are important too. 

I would be devastated (and simply wouldn't stay in a mono relationship) if, as suggested above, my needs had to remain a fantasy. That's just not an option. I'm sure your dude feels the same way. 

I feel like you either need to ease into his kinks and learn to like them (you'll be surprised what you can learn to like/we all do things we don't like in bed, it's just part of compromising) or let him play w others.

This is something I struggle with, because I take Ritalin. So I try to eat pretty much 1st thing when I wake up. It's tough sometimes, but I'm really trying. Otherwise, I don't have an appetite until late at night. 

I def advise talking to your doctor about it. 
I've never experienced anything like this on Met at all. Maybe it's how I take it? It seems others here have experienced this tho. You just don't want your nutrition to suffer or screw up your metabolism by not eating."
insaneparents,evs0kwe,t1_evrzuf6,1564724912.0,"Did your parents and siblings barge in on you tho? 

(Imo it's an issue when these matters involve siblings of a different sex. Obvi.)

I didn't have a lock. Cause I'm an only child and my parents respected my privacy enough to knock when I was alone in my room. 

But this girl is obvi having an issue... and no one in that household seems to be respecting it/her."
insaneparents,evrzkac,t1_evrzdt4,1564723816.0,"Uh well if her brother is coming in fucking w her and her parent keeps coming in without knocking, yeah. 

Privacy is pretty fucking important when you're that age. 

She should be able to change or whatever without someone busting in her room."

childfree,evqkyoa,t1_evp6ipn,1564693881.0,I just said this may not be the case for *this* couple... but it was a general statement about the difficulty of adoption.
WhyWereTheyFilming,evoaqku,t1_ev6krqi,1564642275.0,I'm traumatized.
childfree,evn8f9b,t3_ckbcup,1564620493.0,"In fairness, it's very hard to adopt. 

That may not be the case for this couple.
But just putting that out there."
CougarsAndCubs,evn5lrr,t3_ck9af0,1564619115.0,"I think you just need to be honest w her about your situation - you're a struggling college student. She needs to respect that. If she doesn't, she's not worth it. 

Hopefully you can find other activities. And it sounds like she can support herself just fine. 

It's honestly all about communication and compromise."
PCOS,evn4gil,t3_ck8znd,1564618571.0,"Omg. No. 

It was devastating when I was 1st dx (about 10 yrs ago). I was upset about the weight issues, lifelong meds and of course the fertility issues. 

But I was involved in a life-altering accident since then and... PCOS is... I mean, it's hardly on my radar compared to what I'm going through now. 

Yeah it sucks, but...

PCOS didn't make me suicidal and land me in the psych ward multiple times like this accident/aftermath did. Nor did it turn my life completely upside down. And make me disabled, lacking autonomy, etc. No. 

Not to compare struggles, but I think some people really just need to get perspective. 

This group/PCOS can be depressing at times, but it's hardly a death sentence. 

I *wish* PCOS was all I was dealing with. Geez. Fuck. I sincerely fn wish. Smh."
Hypothyroidism,evn2dz6,t1_evi0eqa,1564617544.0,"Wait. So you're symptoms didn't improve post-surgery? 

Geez. I was referred to a surgeon back in March. 
They keep just putting me off and increasing my D. 

Meanwhile, just like you said, I'm just living on the couch. Aside from the lethargy, I'm having pretty significant mental health/mood issues. It's not fun. 

I hate to think surgery won't resolve the issue :( 

Thanks for your thorough answer.

Edit: Oh. It looks like some symptoms immediately improved, just not the heartburn/GI-type stuff. Got it. 

I have nausea often. And am just starting to be more sensitive to spicy food (heartburn/reflux). But the latter is mild for now. Ondestron helps w the nausea. Luckily."
insaneparents,evhjh4w,t1_evhix2n,1564527347.0,"What I'm saying is there is a difference btwn not being given the opportunity and choosing not to embrace said opportunity. 

Introverts choose. Neglected/abused children aren't given a choice. That's what I mean. 

But fair enough if his issue isn't that deep."
insaneparents,evhb8bl,t1_eveuu7q,1564523666.0,It depends on the state. But right. Basically.
insaneparents,evhas4y,t3_cjdg1p,1564523467.0,"Bitch needs to put furniture in front of the door, because not a soul 1 in that house has respect for the fact she's a 16 yo girl, apparently."
insaneparents,evha4l2,t3_cjf56x,1564523187.0,"Holy shit. I just assumed the mother said this (considering the proud mom vibes). 
Scrolling through comments, just realized it could've been the Dad (comparing her to his wife). 

Omg. I'm mortified for this girl. *And* wanna puke. Wtf. 

(It's bad enough to think these things, but who the fucks says them in public?! I'd like to see the comments on this.)"
insaneparents,evh939i,t1_evebz0h,1564522742.0,"I'm confused on how she's right. This premise is correct. But, based on what he's saying, that doesn't appear to be her angle. 

I think she's misunderstanding the question. 

He's not being left out of anything. These are his personal choices. 

You feel like shit because your mom treated you like shit. And, yeah, this kid will too if his mom keeps it up. 

But nothing wrong w being introverted or going one's own way. Parents just fuck kids up for these choices/behavior. They're the problem. Not the kid. 

Smart kids will figure it out. Like you did."
