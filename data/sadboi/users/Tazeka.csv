Been medicated, gone to therapy, ect. The only thing that's really made a difference for me was changing my circumstances and having a supportive partner. There are still days where I'm super low energy and every little thing bothers me. From what I can gather, it's largely an anxiety thing. I wish I knew how to control it but it doesn't really feel like a choice.

I'm also about 99% sure I have dermatilomania- it's not hard to diagnose, I just haven't gone to the trouble of seeing someone about it yet. And that's technically a form of OCD so it wouldn't surprise me if I have other OCD tendencies.

I have a couple of chronic pain conditions as well which tend to lower one's ability to handle stress.

One more thing to consider- This pandemic is not doing anyone any favors as far as mental health is concerned. Whether you're home in quarantine, considered ""essential"", or can't afford to quarantine, this is a hard way to live. Go easy on her and yourself."
