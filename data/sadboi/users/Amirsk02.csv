DebateAnAtheist,fqwxylb,t1_fquljan,1589720906.0,"Hi. Thank u for your reply! I am from a country which represents itself as all-muslim: Iran. Though I’m an Atheist and my pointy opinion might come from the fact that I’m living in an environment I actually really hate. I don’t know much about Christianity, yet I do respect them as long as we don’t have conflict. I don’t know about Christianity’s hell, but I’ve been asking this question here about Islam’s hell and I’ve been wondering about it. What if I’m a good person, I am kind to animals etc but I just happen to not believe in a god?! They answered I’d still burn in hell because of disbelief... thing is Iran is a really messed country and many problems come from mullahs themselves. So based on their logic, they will go to their heaven but with some little punishment maybe because they were god’s people and I’ll burn anyways?! Hmmm nope. 

Another thing for me is that the whole concept of hell and heaven was based on lack of justice. People had been asking themselves what will happen to the cruel king then? Religion answers: hell. That problem is solved today. We have law and judicial system. So what’s the matter of hell and heaven anymore?!

Sorry for long and political message! I hope you have a good day!"
DebateAnAtheist,fqsxptw,t3_gkng77,1589622726.0,"Religious logic has always been ridiculous to me. For the point that you mentioned we have free will, sounds so nonsense. Because if we have free will then why would I go to hell after I die, because I’d chosen what god didn’t aim?! I don’t buy this..."

Btw, I don’t know if it’s rude or bad, but I’ll be thankful if you text me, since I’m still a bit shy and I don’t know how to start a conversation. Thank u so much again."

This is kinda the same thing Communistic China has done and caused a worldwide disaster.

Wait a sec, S10e has 2 cameras with more price and S10 Lite has 3 cameras with less price? Wtf is that logic Samsung? Are u mad at what?!"
