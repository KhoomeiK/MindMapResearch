Anxiety,fnc3ltl,t1_fna9faw,1586827903.0,"A few things to keep in mind: while I don't have any sources on hand, the vast majority of cases are mild, not any worse than the regular flu. [IHME](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) says we are past the peak, so things will likely only get better from here. Most importantly, if you are following official health guidelines and social distancing, staying home, etc. that reduces your changes of getting it DRASTICALLY. So, with all this in mind, I'd say there's pretty good reason for hope :)"
