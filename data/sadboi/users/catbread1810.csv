HousingUK,fjr03sz,t3_fekfeu,1583579835.0,"Hello, thank you for all of your guidance. 

The aim here is to get more time, we were so close to moving out on the 1st of March and my landlord does intend to go to court next week, I am told. We did contact her and explained that the bad reference off the letting agent meant we couldn't proceed with leaving, but they do not want to get involved and want the agent to handle the court process. The agent seems to think the landlord is handling it, and they are utterly disinterested in this property as it has not been sold via themselves. 

The problem regarding the reference is that my letting agent told me that my reference would only reflect my arrears and the actual reference that I was made aware of included some rather questionable comments. My letting agent has denied making these statements when I called to see if I was able to address any of them, but I was shut down quickly. My solicitor has asked if I can speak to company that referenced me to obtain this data as it is apparently mine. I'm not so sure but I'm happy to try. The idea is to get me the truthful reference I was told I would be receiving, not the unfounded bollocks that was said about me. I have evidence to back up claims made (4yrs of positive post inspection reports). 

I don't have an issue with my landlord for wanting to sell and I didn't have an issue with the agent until it came back that we are essentially awful tenants because of a relationship breakdown that we weren't aware of. 

Thank you all for your input."
HousingUK,fjoo5mp,t3_fekfeu,1583531646.0,"Thank you for your reply.

I have been to the council and they have already accepted responsibility for me as my arrears were due to universal credit, so they will arrange emergency/temp accommodation. I am set to pay off just under half by the time this all rolls through. I've got 3 children, it's been rough but they can't claim that I have not paid towards them. I'm not being evicted due to them either, it is exclusively to to with the sale.

So on the whole, not the worst but far from the best. If they end up serving notice again but returning my deposit, I'm guessing that it's going to end up going back to them to clear owed money if it means a reasonable reference? Regarding a guarantor, I could arrange it if the house was cheap enough and I've been assessed by a guarantor company as back up. 

I don't really hold out much hope for finding another rental via an agent and most private is out of our budget right now."
