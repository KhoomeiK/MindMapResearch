EDAnonymous,fjgb6vl,t3_fd5uvc,1583320312.0,"Mindset, application, mental stability, and starting weight. I think when there is an application of fasting in a life where you don't count, you aren't obsessive about food, and it is done with medical input, it's fine and healthy. In a cycle of binge/purge in the mind of an already underweight disordered person, its dangerous. My 2 cents."
