apexlegends,ffyj7y1,t3_evqsmh,1580347718.0,I would love to see SBMM out and while it would be cool to have duos permanently it's not gonna happen cause I'm guessing business wise it's better to keep it for special events.
depression,fbnjc0b,t1_fbni9xp,1576998688.0,Glad I could help man. If you ever wanna talk when ur in the feels msg me!
depression,fbne6do,t1_fbnd4mw,1576996367.0,No need to apologize and I feel you. I feel the same way. Even the tiniest things that require the least effort I don't do cause it feels exhausting. I wish I could help.
depression,fbnb1xl,t1_fbnauk1,1576995144.0,Dam. Sorry to hear that man. I hope so too and thanks for chatting.
depression,fbn9zfg,t3_ee15ky,1576994730.0,I've tried to opened up to my friends before but I can tell they can't fully understand what I'm trying to say. I've honestly given up and dont share anymore because I truly think that people that dont feel the way we do will never understand.
depression,fbn9ibf,t1_fbn936g,1576994536.0,Couldn't tell you. Idk what happened but I'm pretty sure I can trace it back to 4 years ago. I was still in HS and it's like a switch turned on. I know it sounds weird but I can't explain. I just started feeling this way for no reason or at least can't find the reason.
depression,fbn5t88,t1_fbn4kiy,1576993114.0,No problem man and it's not weird. I've been feeling depressed for the past 4 years of my life. The only people that truly understand how we feel is others like us. If you ever need to talk message me on here.
depression,fbn4o74,t3_ee0vfm,1576992683.0,I don't know your situation but I'll use my friends as an example. I've opened up to my really close friends and honestly it doesn't seem like they get it. I feel as if people who don't feel the same way that you and I do will not completely understand what we're going through so I've stopped sharing. I know it's different since it's your husband. I wish I could help.
depression,fbn433d,t3_ee0zcw,1576992461.0,That sounds pretty toxic. If I was in your situation I think I would move out the moment I turn 18. It'll be very hard but at least you won't have to deal with your parents.
depression,fbjadpu,t3_edp1gb,1576928932.0,I feel you. Been there for years. I sometimes have fun at work but the moment I get off the feeling just overwhelms me and completely pushes everything aside. I'm thinking I shouldn't feel this way but I do anyways and idk why.
depression,fba8yie,t3_ec9c4b,1576670318.0,Yup. I have zero ambition or drive. I honestly just don't understand it. How do people want to go and do stuff. It's a thing I will never understand.
depression,fba8vau,t3_ec9eua,1576670214.0,Wow your feeling exactly how I am. I told my close friend how I felt and he just kept asking why. I doubt my friends will ever understand so I keep the sharing to a basic minimum.I have a good life I can admit that but I dont know the reason of why I'm feeling this way. I wish I could figure it out but I think I'm gonna be this way forever.
depression,fba8qme,t3_ec9jv3,1576670057.0,My family and friends is literally the only thing keeping me alive. I can't bear the thought of how sad they would be if I killed myself even though i want to.     I'm just waiting till I pass one of these days.
depression,fba86xp,t3_ecb4lx,1576669390.0,Right there with u. I just want to stop existing.
depression,fba84mq,t3_ecbacs,1576669309.0,Me too man but a word of advice find something to cling on. The only reason why I haven't tried to end my life is the grief and sorrow I would cause my family and friends and I really dont want to do that. If it were not for them I would be long gone. Your son is your life now. Good luck to you my friend.
depression,fanl0o4,t1_fankr0g,1576243833.0,I feel you. Negative thoughts are always popping up in my mind. It's really hard to see things on the positive side. I hope you get better soon my friend.
depression,fanklr0,t3_ea3xg7,1576243476.0,Right there with you. I dont have a reason but I feel what your feeling
depression,fajp3z8,t1_fajoy18,1576149290.0,Wish you luck too. May we find our purposes.
depression,fajp0dp,t3_e9m8sp,1576149150.0,I understand what your saying. I've opened up to my friends before but it seems like they don't completely understand the extent of my feelings/thoughts. I'm the listener as well and its gonna remain that way. I'm done opening to my friends. If you need someone to talk to message me.
depression,fajovoo,t1_fajoqt2,1576148968.0,Not religious no relationship and dislike my job very much. I might be changing it soon but we'll see.
depression,fajoook,t1_fajnitb,1576148690.0,"I hope I find it, thanks for replying."
depression,fajo1u9,t3_e9kzqv,1576147777.0,Yeah I don't understand how people are so happy with life. I can't seem to wrap my head around it but I'm sure it's better them being that way than being like me
depression,fajnybp,t3_e9l3sw,1576147637.0,Although I have never done anything to harm myself the feeling of wanting to cease existing it is an ongoing thought in my head. I know exactly what you mean by being held back. I have my family/close friends that I dont want to cause pain to so I'm slowly suffering through life.
depression,fajnu7j,t3_e9l7ne,1576147472.0,I dont think I will truly find happiness throughout my life. Just have to put that mask on and call it a day.
depression,fajnme0,t3_e9lha9,1576147144.0,I'm with you man. There is no reason for me to feel this way when I have what most don't but I can't help feeling this way. Idk why but I think about suicide everyday and I cannot tell you why I do.
depression,fajmrnf,t3_e9kzfw,1576145860.0,I feel that. I just recently opened up to my two close friends and they didn't seem to understand. It almost felt like they didn't care but I know that's not the case. I only share the bare minimum. Even if I tell them I still don't think they'll understand.
