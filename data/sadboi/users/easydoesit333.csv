Is there a certain energy level you’re meant to maintain? Is friendliness important for the job, or more of hard work? 

Disliking you isn’t the same as sensing incompatibility.

I went on Quora last year and read some cops talking about weed, and the cop I read, he was tired of having to fill up the jails with people on account of weed, like he thought it wasn’t anywhere near the tier of other hard drugs. 

Who knows, maybe someone somewhere down the line got really hurt because of weed, and for valid reasons lobbied for the law to be in place, not really seeing what it really meant for society to have it illegal. I bet lots of things are like that that unfortunately cause these terrible hardships that aren’t to be accounted for. 

But at any rate, your life has taken a hit, and you should feel how you’re feeling and process that. Things aren’t going to be the same, and it’s ok not to be ok, for now. But please try to let the process happen without going so far as suicide, because then that’s just another unfortunate consequence of this law that’s probably going to be phased out for many places within the next ten or twenty years."

Anyway, losing friendships or putting the breaks on some, at least for a little while or in a certain way, is part of experience, like trying to see where your failings are and how to correct them. I doubt your friends would want to see you completely withdraw and put a mask on everything. The depressive mind sometimes builds up these extremes of spewing everything or holding back everything. I think healthy friendships have a bit of that expulsion of toxic stuff and a bit of that restraint. I don’t know about you and your life but sometimes it’s difficult for depressed people to know about boundaries others find normal. Maybe you’ve done it the hard way, but you’ve found a boundary, and I bet it’s going to be easier now to find it again, and how and when to keep from crossing it.

You’ve identified many things that are bothering you, but is it possible that you can identify what you can deal with now, and what you can deal with further down the line?

Especially getting messages from strangers, it can be hard to really appreciate what they’re saying because I mean, who are they, right? I don’t know if any of us can change your mind. Probably the people who could aren’t reading the message you’ve sent to us and they don’t know these things about you. Do they? 

I’m sorry life is so shit. I wish that you could find satisfaction in something else besides cutting or suicide. It’s hard to find people to talk to who understand. I think probably most of us here are a little bit suicidal at least and you know what? I think that has to be ok. Maybe everyone should be a little suicidal. I don’t know. I can’t understand people who have never felt this way. 

Anyway, please let us know how you’re doing."
SuicideWatch,flfuutw,t3_fohujv,1585118680.0,"Uh so just say things you wrote here, like about how you tried to hint you were suicidal with what you wrote. I don’t think I would’ve gotten the message you intended either. It’s pretty subtle. Saying you’re not going to grow up can mean a couple different things. 

I don’t know. Why did you write lmao? It seems like you were trying to say something genuine and say by what you write here, but I think, writing lmao tends to give off something that can be sarcastic or disingenuous. Like an impression that you can’t be bothered to care. 

Why don’t you stop write “lmao” for a while and see if you can say what you really mean like, it’s kind of hard to understand these kinds of mixed up meanings sometimes."
SuicideWatch,flfugm2,t3_foif8a,1585118237.0,I relate.
SuicideWatch,flfue90,t3_foijif,1585118163.0,:-( I cant imagine the kind of fear and sadness you must be feeling.
SuicideWatch,flfu8x6,t3_foj8pi,1585117999.0,"Hello. Are you feeling suicidal? These feelings suck, don’t they."
SuicideWatch,flftqpq,t3_fojf05,1585117464.0,"Why can’t you get help? Financial reasons? 

Friends can get exhausted, it’s true. Even people who care about you can’t always be good friends. Emotions are so inconvenient and burdensome. It’s not always possible to be loving or kind. 

If your friends are exhausted, maybe they do need some break, but don’t kill yourself for needing more than they’re able to give or you’re able to afford. If possible try to find other communities of support, like here, or like whatever sub you can find that can give you some relief. 

It’s a skill to be able to sense when your friends are tired and it’s something you’ll have to learn about how to respond to those signals that will leave you both in a good place. Experience and practice like you’re having can be traumatic, it’s true. But please don’t give up yet."
SuicideWatch,flft7v8,t3_fojz2t,1585116915.0,"You know, I bet a lot of people can relate. I bet there are whole communities that can help you not buckle under the weight of this hefty diagnosis. Why don’t you try to find some support HIV related subs?"
SuicideWatch,flft11v,t3_fokp7c,1585116723.0,"I think your reasoning is pretty good. This is probably a good time to do suicide. But also it might be kinda bad too because hospitals are trying their hardest with the corona virus. Do you think you can reassess until after all this virus stuff is over? It’s brought death closer to home for most of us. I think we’re all going to go through a period of mass catharsis after this, and that could be kind of cool. Like some shared trauma to talk about and relate with each other about."
SuicideWatch,flfsmzf,t3_fokqfp,1585116321.0,I hate these feelings too. Why does everything have to be so hard?
SuicideWatch,flfsl2x,t3_fol2ad,1585116267.0,I don’t know. It’s a tough one. What makes you want to die?
SuicideWatch,flfsgmw,t3_fol44h,1585116144.0,Have you had cancer for a long time? When did you find out?
SuicideWatch,flfsb3y,t1_flekh14,1585115989.0,"I am cheering for you. 

And thanks, you too!"
SuicideWatch,flcx87w,t3_fo2v2s,1585050081.0,"Hello. Please keep posting. It’s important not to numb out, like, hopefully there are better reasons to live then just you can’t die."
SuicideWatch,flcx321,t3_fo2vnt,1585049937.0,I’m also embarrassingly alone.
SuicideWatch,flcx1m2,t3_fo32k5,1585049895.0,"You’ll have to call your doctor before visiting, I think. The virus and all."
SuicideWatch,flcwzyb,t3_fo33i7,1585049847.0,I relate
SuicideWatch,flcwxvi,t3_fo33pl,1585049787.0,It’s true this virus is a blessing and curse in many ways.
SuicideWatch,fimtaqt,t3_f8q6s9,1582546155.0,Honestly it sounds like you really care about her. I don’t know how you fucked up but it happens. I doubt any of us are completely happy with ourselves.
SuicideWatch,filki1k,t1_filb77w,1582503710.0,"I’m not a cutter, so while it surprises me that you like the pain, I appreciate hearing about your perspective. I think a healthier outlet would probably help you out a bit too, just thinking about it pragmatically. But I imagine you’ve probably had this conversation many times at this point. 

To be honest, I comment here to feel useful, and because sometimes it helps me gain perspective dealing with my own miserable life. I sometimes think nothing I say helps, and maybe that’s as it should be. I would also not put much stock in what a random internet person says, and I guess that’s a good caution to take, even if it sometimes means the good goes out with the bad. 

Anyway, thanks for saying thank you. It helps me out too."
SuicideWatch,fil8bsp,t1_fil77rb,1582495851.0,"Not the greatest, honestly, but not the worst either. Thanks for asking. 

That’s an image I can relate to, and the way you explained it makes me feel like I can begin to have an idea of what you mean. Have you written poetry before? I imagine you might like it. Is it hard to write right now, with you wrist? 

Please do use r/findareddit to see if there might be any more subs to help support you. Unfortunately this one doesn’t always have the necessary user base that it should."
SuicideWatch,fil6o34,t1_fijzort,1582494806.0,"That’s a bit of relief to hear, about how you know how to dress wounds. How are you feeling today?"
SuicideWatch,fijnoah,t3_f86hqy,1582456589.0,I’m sorry that happened. That kind of empty feeling is awful. I hope you feel a little better reading the responses here.
SuicideWatch,fijnjyd,t3_f86614,1582456429.0,"I wonder if soon you won’t be feeling quite so bad and hope that seeing the psychiatrist can help. I am not sure how it will because I never experienced it. But somehow it seems to be a good step in the right direction from others point of view. I think it’s hard to feel good and I don’t a lot of the time but either. I am sad hearing about how you cry yourself to sleep. I think at least it is good that you can cry. I think it’s probably better than being numb. I’m sure that sounds better I think it’s probably not, at least from my experience."
SuicideWatch,fijmxcl,t3_f86joz,1582455575.0,"Hello, I’m glad you didn’t go too deep. It’s something isn’t it, hospitals? Outrageous prices. Will you be alright? Do you know how to bandage the wound? Can you do a search in a sub like r/askdoctors?"
SuicideWatch,fijmnm7,t3_f86q1l,1582455202.0,"What you’re describing does sound nice. I wish I could feel that sense of release. Would you mind posting here again? I envy your feeling, but probably should dissuade you from suicide, because I suppose that life might be worth something. I don’t have much to offer, but hopefully other people can help talk to you, if you’re interested. How old are you? Have you had therapy, and do you have family or friends to talk to?"
SuicideWatch,fijmc7u,t3_f875mj,1582454771.0,"I’m pretty self absorbed, but I think others are a little better."
SuicideWatch,fijmacg,t1_fijm4eg,1582454699.0,"Maybe you don’t have to tell her about everything. Maybe you can tell her about how you’re feeling in general and then just do something together to help distract you. If you want to plan a day for shopping or watching a movie or something which can take your attention off things, I’m sure your friend would like offering her presence during your difficult time. Then if you’d like please do write about your feelings on Reddit or in journals etc."
SuicideWatch,fijm4jj,t3_f87a2a,1582454486.0,"It’s not an easy place you’re in. It’s understandable to feel depressed. I think I would feel the same way and have for different reasons. Maybe you can’t help the heavy burden you have now, but maybe slowly but surely your situation can improve as you get more experienced with caretaking."
SuicideWatch,fijlxvc,t3_f87gmn,1582454238.0,6 years is a reasonable time. Many people here only give themselves months or weeks. I always think that it’s kinda unreasonable time span. It’s hard to change anything around in even a year. But hopefully you can use the time and do it right.
