Nurse,fop8mv5,t3_g7zxah,1587955537.0,I actually cringe more when people call themselves heroes as oppose to someone else pointing it out. I have friends that take pictures on themselves wearing their badges saying that they’re going in to save lives and to me that is cringy. I love humble people...
lonely,fnwlp4c,t1_fnwkvxe,1587320781.0,That’s exactly how I feel! I’ve reached out to people who I thought I was friends with and they just brush me off. They were the same people who came to me when they needed something but since everything’s going ok in their lives I guess they don’t need me. It really is tough... I thought about even doing a bible study at my church before my church is mainly elderly people so I don’t think I would fit in
lonely,fnv7anq,t3_g3nsjv,1587282708.0,I feel that way too especially since my bf has so many friends and I feel like he treats me differently because I don’t have a lot of friends.
socialskills,fll3j6a,t3_fpgq3p,1585252943.0,This is exactly me. I worry about everything especially about offending other people. I primarily worry about that because I know how it feels like to be offended and don’t want to put anyone through that. I know it’s tough and know that you are not alone...
Anxiety,fcpqj3d,t1_fcpdnms,1577869956.0,"Thank you for understanding. I wish I didn’t have this mental condition. I’ve tried to talk to my bf so many times about it already but his life is “perfect” so he doesn’t understand and doesn’t even try to understand. He thinks anxiety is all in my head and I could control it, if only he knew. I hope you have a happy New Years my friend."
Anxiety,fcp1kwx,t1_fcp10si,1577847663.0,I have been working through my anxiety but today I just didn’t feel like dealing with the draining feeling afterward. I wanted to go into the New Year the way I wanted to which is relaxed in the comfort of my own home. He doesn’t like being around my family either because he hates talking to people and I never force him.
relationship_advice,fciw1u6,t1_fcivyjg,1577671181.0,Yes and I don’t even consider it venting more like telling me about his day which does consists of things that annoyed him but when it comes to me it’s like he doesn’t even want to hear it
Anxiety,fc2ge88,t3_efqerm,1577358749.0,I do this all the time! I get anxiety about everything so much that sometimes I don’t even want to read the response so I’ll let it sit there for dayssss before I read it!

relationship_advice,fbt1jf3,t1_fbt168q,1577065845.0,He claims it’s because he’s not financially stable and that when he is that we will live together but that looks like it’s not going to happen for a while. He loves living for free and having his mom cook for him...

AskWomen,fa93vvf,t3_e7wcw7,1575861751.0,"This definitely hits home for me especially since I’m on social media and constantly see everyone getting engaged, married, having kids...and I’m here with a bf that doesn’t even care about me on the verge of a breakup. I honestly have to keep thinking to myself that when it’s my time it’ll happen. As cliche as that sounds, I trust in God that He will plant everything in my life at the right timing even though I don’t see a way right now."
relationship_advice,fa2ttqh,t3_e7q2gy,1575786608.0,What you just described it definitely him. Everything is always my fault because he doesn’t see any fault in his actions. As for him losing his job or something happening to him for him to change his ways... i feel like that will never happen because he’s always had an easy life. Nothing bad or traumatic has ever happened to him and if it did sometimes I feel like his heart is so cold he wouldn’t even care

AskWomen,f86a7dv,t1_f869yr9,1574293525.0,And I think that’s exactly where I’m jealousy and insecurity comes from. He’s NEVER reassured me or even compliments me so I have to just know myself that he’s not going to ever leave me for another women. Whenever I’ve tried talking to him about my insecurities he gets mad right away
relationship_advice,f842lli,t1_f8411ed,1574228458.0,He went to a 3 month program that I encouraged him to do because he wasn’t happy at his current job. This job is something he’s NOT passionate about. He mainly wants it because his friends work two floors underneath him. I asked him if he was becoming interested in her because of the way he’s been acting toward me which I feel is an appropriate question to ask if it was something concerning me.
Catholicism,f83ih67,t3_dy20x4,1574212783.0,"Please pray that me and my bf can reconcile our relationship. I pray that God may help him be more patient, kind, loving, and faithful.

AskWomen,f829yym,t3_dyjbnh,1574187086.0,"Me & my bf have been fighting (& possibly on the verge on breaking up) so this hit home. I’m preparing myself for the breakup because he’s always the one who wants to leave, never me. I couldn’t even sleep last night because that empty feeling in my heart. The feeling that something, or in this case someone, is missing. Every time I was almost about to sleep that empty feeling would hit so hard and wake me up. I’m sorry that you have to go through this. The only thing that kept me going is praying."

socialanxiety,f6ys649,t3_dtqpa5,1573294278.0,That’s exactly how I feel too. People always seem to have interesting conversations and joke around with each other (I work in an office setting so I could hear everyone’s conversations very easily) but when I walk in they never include me or have conversations like that with me. It makes my social anxiety worst and this seems to happen everywhere I go. Idk if I give out an awkward vibe...

AskWomen,f5xf6us,t1_f5x9b0t,1572539947.0,Omg that’s exactly how I act when I meet someone too! I get anxious and nervous because I really need a friend and I feel like it scares them away but I can’t help it. I have social anxiety so it’s already hard for me to come out of my shell
AskWomen,f5orzc5,t3_dog2t8,1572329110.0,My dad (whom I no longer talk to because he left my fam several years ago) taught me that without money you’re nothing. I would never teach my children that their lives are worth any type of money. Their lives are priceless and want them to grow up knowing that with or without money everyone is equal and should all be treated worth respect.
wisdomteeth,f4oye7w,t3_dl8yq5,1571711244.0,I’m day 5 post op and mine bled a lot until today. I called the dentist and they said it’s normal and told me to soak a tea bag and hold it in place of whichever tooth was bleeding. It actually helped slow the bleeding down.
wisdomteeth,f4m5hfl,t1_f35asde,1571674696.0,Is it just salt water that you’re placing in the syringe to clean out the holes? They never gave me a syringe just told me to gargle salt water which doesn’t help to get everything out

BreakUps,f1yu4ia,t3_db2i8s,1569824748.0,This is exactly how I feel. Days drag on... I can’t sleep enough because my body literally doesn’t want to function anymore. Worse thing is forcing yourself up to get ready and go to class and sit through hours of lecture when you feel like your dying inside
relationship_advice,f1yso15,t3_db4src,1569823651.0,I’m sooo sorry that youre going through this right now. I’m going through a similar situation as well. My bf broke up with me a week before my 30th bday and 3 days before our vacation to Hawaii that was suppose to be for my bday. I know it hurts sooo bad. It hurts like your heart is shattered in pieces on the floor and trust me I’ve felt like I don’t want to live any more because the pain is unbearable but I have faith that God wouldn’t let this happen if there wasn’t something better for me & YOU out there. Please don’t hurt yourself... I know idk you but you seem like such a sweet person and there’s someone out there who will love you the way you deserve. I know it hurts even thinking about someone else but it will get better and you can message me if you need someone to talk to.
Anxiety,f1t6ot9,t3_daq6vo,1569739604.0,"This really hit home with me. I have really bad social anxiety and suffered with acne pretty much all of my life; I’m 30 now. I totally feel for you. I’ve had so many point out my acne and sometimes they don’t even need to say anything because the look they give me already says so much. I’m sorry you had to experience this. Just know that your acne will go away but she will always have a inconsiderate, cold heart. Keep your head up!"
heartbreak,eyokmzh,t3_cxz1cx,1567278619.0,I know how you feel... I’m going through the exact same thing right now. It’s so debilitating. I just wanna sleep all day and don’t have an appetite. I miss him soo much it hurts my heart.

BreakUps,eylc3hs,t3_cx6p6j,1567181037.0,"I needed this. I’ve been in so much pain from my breakup is unbearable. He keeps putting all the blame on me because I had trust issues and a lot of insecurities and he said I killed the relationship. But he was not a loving or affectionate person so his attitude did not help my insecurities, but just made them worst. But I never put blame on him because what’s the point of arguing with someone who doesn’t care, I lose either way."
BreakUps,eyl8lfy,t3_cxf7gi,1567178743.0,Yes this is exactly what I’m going through. I miss him so much. My heart literally wakes me up in the middle of the night because it’s in so much pain and when I wake up I realize it’s all real life and start crying so bad

I had to force myself otherwise I know I would fall behind in school.

I don’t have any friends unfortunately. We even had a vacation to Hawaii planned this Friday that we’re not going to anymore. It’s hurts so bad I could literally feel my heart aching.

relationship_advice,exaag7f,t1_exa81sb,1566103289.0,Thank you for responding to me with this because it really made me feel like I’m not alone. I’m currently in a huge fight right now with my bf and I’m here crying while he yelled at me and told me he doesn’t like how I am and he doesn’t know why he’s with me. It’s things like this that makes me feel so insecure and that even long after the fight lingers on. I don’t have many friends and he does so I know he would be ok without me. That’s why I resorted to reddit so I could ask advise from people when I’m feeling low. Thanks for your reassuring words.

Accutane,evxshli,t3_clj2an,1564905506.0,Accutane stays in your system for a month so you should be good not taking it for a few days. I used to work at a dermatology office and the doctors would tell patients that all the time but you should definitely call your derm to ask what they suggests.
