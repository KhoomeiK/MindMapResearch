The fact that people are content with soing The same Thing every day, disquists me. I will never be free of this curse in my own mind. Dont know what to do."
depression,fq31syf,t3_g8eq07,1589062213.0,It is hard to find that special person. The one that brings out The best in you. The one that makes you happy with there mere presence. I believe you found that person. But she was taken from you. You have my deepest condolences.
