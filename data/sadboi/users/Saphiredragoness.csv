When one client didn't want to pay a $700 bill for their pet's hospitalization they said they were mad at me for something in a letter. The Dr came and scolded me first without asking what happened or anything and I had to remind him that it was the clients that didn't want to pay and that this was an ongoing issue for a while. Also the other receptionist opened one morning to a crazy lady banging on the front door and making threats and in the long run the Dr was only worried about how to clarify the situation on the bad review. The receptionist didn't call the cops and the Dr wasn't answering his phone so she had to wait til the Dr got there. Both clients unfortunately lost their pets and so he just wrote of the bills for both clients to make them happy and gave them the ashes."
