I know reaching out to get help is scary, and I've been there. But by posting on here, you've actually taken the first step. It's clear that you're suffering and you want help. As someone said below, calling a suicide hotline is a good place to start. It can take the edge off of an intense panic and they can tell you what resources might be available. The other thing too is that they are designed for people who specifically are looking for this sort of help. 

They may also be able to provide some advice about how to tell your parents. <3"
HouseMD,f949p7n,t3_e3dgbd,1575081536.0,"I wasn't a fan of their relationship. I didn't mind as much when it was more of a ""will they won't they"" scenario; but, in Season 5, episode 7, ""The Itch"" when Wilson is talking to Cuddy about her possibly dating House, she says: 

""You know exactly how it would go. It'd start off exciting. We'd get caught up in the novelty and the hostility and the forbiddenness. And then we'd realize that the flirty hostility is just hostility and his inability to open up is no longer exciting, it’s just frustrating. And then it’s the inevitable blowup and the recriminations and we don’t talk for two months…""

Minus the amount of time Cuddy didn't talk to House for, this was pretty spot on for how Season 7 went. And honestly this was the issue that I saw with most of the people House was romantically involved with; Stacy was unable to deal with how House had changed after the infarction, Cameron wanted to save him, Cuddy wanted him to change for her, Lydia (woman who visited Mayfield in Season 6) is married and never really got to know House. To be perfectly honest, until House tried to stop Dominika from getting her green card without her knowing, I actually ended up really liking them together. Dominika just looked at House as a person, not a project, not someone she needed to change or fix or save. There's an episode where they are talking about physics, when they go to a gun range together, and she's honestly one of the more positive people in his life. 

However, I did enjoy the mechanisms of House and Cuddy's working relationship though; House is the outrageous and rude but extremely talented doctor helping with all the rare cases and Cuddy keeps him on board because he's incredibly good at what he does. They played off each other very well and even with the flirtation between them, it made for some very good and funny banter. 

Additionally, one of the things I didn't like was how Cuddy was relegated to becoming a love interest in Season 7. I really like her as a character. She's ambitious, badass, brave, intelligent; she shows she has a more soft and emotional side as well when it comes to wanting to be a mother and adjusting to that role; and she's freaking great at her job. She was complex and smart and interesting and I feel like they really watered her down. 

I wish they hadn't spent all of Season 7 on House in a relationship, at all, with anyone. It took away from the medical elements of the show (which I really had liked in previous seasons) and Season 6 had already had a lot of departures from the normal formula."
ABDL,f945ilk,t3_e3fxfm,1575077966.0,"What might help is discussing things with her directly.

Degrassi,f8vgz8h,t3_e2d5xm,1574869206.0,"I can kind of see both sides of people's arguments here. 

On the one hand, Miles and Lola seemed to develop a relationship out of both of them feeling hurt for other reasons, which seems like a rather shallow foundation, but is also very human at the same time. I agree that Lola likely still had feelings for Tiny, and Miles obviously still had feelings for Tristan. In a way, they did sort of use each other, but at the same time, there was a mutual respect and acceptance for how the other person was feeling, which they really didn't seem to be getting from those around them. 

I do agree that it was rushed, we didn't really see many episodes with them. It would have been interesting to see Frankie's reaction to one of her bff's being with her brother. Maybe them going their separate ways wouldn't have been so rushed and intense if they'd had more time on screen. And while I do not condone cheating, I think that Miles realized how much he really loved Tristan in being with Lola. The relationship itself, while born out of drama, was not in itself dramatic, which was nice to see for both characters, as someone else described. 

Lola lost her virginity to Miles, got pregnant by him, and had an abortion. Yes, it was rather rushed, but sometimes that is how life goes. I thought it was incredibly brave of her to talk about it on her YouTube channel. I like the fact that Degrassi has shown girls who decide to keep their baby, those who decide to abort, and those who decide to give their baby up for adoption. 

As far as Lola's character, yes, she can be sort of ditzy at times, but she's also got a huge heart. She readily accepted Miles' sexuality and helped Yael learn they were non-binary (one of my FAVORITE Lola story lines, hands down), and stood up against racism for Tiny."

HouseMD,f7c8t3c,t3_dt5has,1573586938.0,"So, miltk offered a very brilliant explanation lol. 

I have a few additional ideas as well:

I think in the episode with Cameron, House thought he might be able to change her mind about leaving, before resigning to the fact that he couldn't. In some ways, Cameron's criticisms of House regarding his lack of humanity towards patients is more focused on the external concept of the value of human life. 

In the episode with Cuddy, her criticisms and reasoning for breaking up with House are more internally focused on the fact that House does whatever he can to avoid pain and not allowing himself to deal with his own pain when someone he loves is hurting. 

I could be wrong, but I think there are some similarities between Cameron and Cuddy in that they both wanted to heal House, in their own ways. Cameron states it outright, and in the episode where House and Cuddy get together, he drops the Vicodin in favor of being with Cuddy. 

But in the end, House would not change his ideologies for Cameron, and he would not give up his need to avoid pain for Cuddy. It sort of emphasizes the ""people don't change"" ideology. 

Additionally, House spent the entirety of Season 6 trying to change himself and his life for the better. He goes to rehab, attends therapy. He thinks that will fix things when he goes back to the hospital. But it doesn't really, and House is still miserable. Wilson is back together again with Sam, so the one relationship he's relied on for so long is not as present. Thing's aren't getting better and he isn't any happier. He nearly relapses on Vicodin but then Cuddy appears; when he was on the brink of losing hope, this was something that happened that could maybe make him happy. So, long story short, the reason he doesn't chase after Cuddy is because by that point he was hanging by a thread. 

I don't know for sure, of course, but it's fun to discuss different ideas. :3"
HouseMD,f7c6q66,t3_duh6oh,1573585624.0,"I agree with what others have said below; it is in line with House's philosophy that people (overall) don't change, and, that audiences have a tendency to like consistency within a character, especially when a show is formulaic like House was. 

That being said, one could view House's faked suicide as a selfless act, in that he did so in an effort to spend the remainder of Wilson's life with Wilson. (That also being said, David Shore stated in an interview that he the left the ending ambiguous on purpose; so, it's possible that Wilson actually does survive). Still though, House's positive intent would be there."

The issue isn't so much the the NP's initial reply, it's the fact that she ignored the OP's request the second time, and pinned her leg down. I don't think the NP had bad intentions, but I do think she is in the wrong here. 

Also, yes, there is no way she could have known that OP had previously had a traumatic experience. However, as these types of experiences are common, and talking about them can be extremely difficult for people, medical personnel in many places are now trained to be accommodating to this. 

I do think she should be allowed to make a complaint, or at the very least, be able to request someone else to do her pap the next time. NPs are human too and make mistakes. If I was the NP in the situation, even if I had been one for awhile, I would want to know if a patient I worked with felt this way so I could learn from the experience."

Foreman always seemed to be fighting for leadership, and Chase always seemed to be fighting to be recognized. That isn't to say that's all there was to Chase and Foreman's characters. Foreman was incredibly intelligent, and while he had gotten into some trouble in the past, he didn't allow that to define him and worked hard to make his life better. Chase often was forced to face his own morality and himself, going from seminary school into medicine, the Dibala case, the time where his father died and it caused him to be distracted in properly attending to a patient. In Cameron's case, she was both damaged and yet in denial, in pain but still wanting to view the world with rose colored glasses. She had more of an obvious emotional sensitivity, such as struggling to give patients bad news, which Wilson called her out on. She was always very empathetic towards patients. At the same time, she struggled a lot with romantic relationships, idealizing both House and Chase. When she left House's team, she started coming into her own, figuring out what she wanted and making decisions for herself. I personally don't have a character on House that I dislike, because it presented the idea that people are not intrinsically good or intrinsically bad.

What may help with the math class, is writing down the steps needed to get the answer to a particular problem. For instance, say you were needing to solve this equation 4(3-2). 

1.) Do the equation in the parentheses first. 

2.) Multiply the remaining numbers. 

Maybe have the tutor help you through a problem, and then you complete the next one on your own, and have the tutor check it for you. That way, if you get stuck, you can ask for help, and slowly transition into doing the problems on your own. 

Don't forget how far you've come either. I know it's easy when you're feeling terrible to forget about your accomplishments. But you made it to your last semester. And even though you're not wanting to use it, you have a welding degree and two years of experience. Even though that's not the job you're aiming to get, the fact that you had the self-discipline and commitment to complete those things will be impressive to most employers. 

Also, yes, society pushes this narrative that everyone should have their life figured out by 30. My mom is in her 60s and is completely revamping her career. There have been stories in the news of 80 year olds learning new languages and how to play instruments. More and more people these days are putting off getting married. There's no required time frame. 

Relationships and finding someone to be with are definitely difficult things. What might help in the meantime is spending time with family or friends, enriching the relationships you already have and having a support network. If you don't have anyone you are close to right now, try getting involved in some social activities. Shoot for developing platonic bonds. Not saying to give up finding a relationship, but having more people in your life will boost your confidence and will ease feelings of being lonely.

So, I'm a grad student and I work in a lab as part of my program. If there is an experiment going on at the time, it's just white noise to me and I am able to tune it out. However, when there is not an experiment, is pretty quiet in there. Except for this one student...who constantly taps his foot. It drives me fucking crazy. I'm constantly low key glaring at him in hopes he'll stop. I even cough sometimes in an effort to startle/stop him. The other day he was chewing gum \*and\* foot tapping and I was like FUCK. I wanted to tear his leg off and beat him with it. I feel like my irritation intensifies when my anxiety/stress levels get too high.

Gum chewing bothers me so much. It's the sound. It's the smell. It's the action. I have to force myself to focus on something else. I again glare in hopes they'll stop. I know that doesn't quite make sense and is super passive aggressive but I don't want to be thought of as rude.

I also cannot stand the sound or sight of people scraping their nails on fabric; even as I type this, I am cringing, have to put my ear on my shoulder, and flick my nails on my fingers."

Arthur,f00c8xw,t3_d2zhxq,1568300035.0,"It's hard to say. It's an interesting theory, but in an episode that came out not too long ago, Buster talks about a time when he was around preschool or kindergarten age and was being tested for a gifted school He failed at the task they gave him because he felt like the obvious solution to the task was too obvious so he went with another solution that proved to be wrong. He then imagines what it would be like to go back in time and do things differently. So it does seem like the concept of gifted programs exist in the Arthur universe, but this episode seems to indicate that they would be outright specified. And it's not outright specified that Mr. Ratburn's class is labeled as gifted. That being said, you do bring up interesting points, as the Brain is in that class and what Mr. Ratburn teaches seems much more advanced than the other 3rd grade classes. It's also difficult to say though, as in the earlier episodes it's shown that Mr. Ratburn's class was together for 2nd grade as well."
Degrassi,ezmctvd,t3_d1i3hg,1567990141.0,"It's hard to say really, because I feel like Drew was there for Bianca when she needed help. I don't feel like K.C. was there for Jenna as much as he could have been when they had Ty, which makes me think that maybe he wouldn't have been as supportive of Bianca either. On the other hand, I think Bianca is more physically experienced than Jenna, and may have taken the time to think about safer practices with regards to intimacy. (Not dissing Jenna at all, it's just that with more experience, I feel like it would be more on the forefront of Bianca's mind). Without the complications of being a teen Dad, maybe K.C. would have been more supportive in his relationship with Jenna, and he proved to be super supportive when it came to protecting his Mom from his Dad. So maybe they would have worked out. It would have been interesting to see. :)"

childfree,ez8oc8r,t3_d09t6w,1567751062.0,"Based on the fact that it's a mom forum, it makes sense that more of the comments would be encouraging her to have the baby. 

If someone where to say ""I gave up my career/school when I had my baby, and I am happy with my life"" then I would take that to mean that their priorities shifted when they got pregnant and they are satisfied with the decision they ultimately made. 

It may be possible that the moms who had to throw out their careers when they had the baby may be warning OP but...it comes across as though they felt that they had to do that and are pre-commiserating with OP."
childfree,ez8nml5,t3_d07upo,1567750155.0,"I have mixed feelings on this. I feel like many individuals are never presented with a full picture of parenting, and I feel like high schoolers should be educated on the reality of parenting. I feel like they need something in between the extremes of ""funny"" stressed out mom videos that illustrate a lack of sleep and privacy, and the flowery slow motion diaper commercials. I'm childfree myself, but I feel like high schoolers should be taught about parenthood in an honest way, that examines both the joys and the stresses. 

I do not at all feel superior to parents suffering from child regret. If I were to read an article about an individual who said they regretted having kids, I feel like I would not know the full story. A lot of individuals who grew up in tough homes may not have had the opportunity or financial ability to see what a childfree life can be like. Maybe they are dealing with emotional issues and don't realize they are having kids because they want to feel loved or make up for their childhoods. Maybe they were never able to receive education about the issues with the advertising industry. Maybe they are involved in an oppressive cultural or religious environment and they have never known anything different, or do not have access to contraceptives or abortions. 

That being said, I feel absolutely awful for unwanted children. They did not decide to be born. They cannot take care of themselves. And, if a parent decides they no longer want their children once the child becomes older, the child could be thrust into a broken foster care system, will little chance of being adopted because of their age. They will have to suffer in the knowledge that their parents didn't want them. When they grow up, the cycle may even repeat, and the unwanted children will have unwanted children of their own. 

I think there needs to be more widespread education regarding sex and parenting, and better access to birth control and abortions. With the advancement of technology, this information is reaching further than it ever has before, although there is still a lot of room for improvement. And with that need for improvement, comes the fact that there still exist regretful parents. I believe they have a right to vent just as much as anyone else, and maybe their stories will actually help people think more about how big of a decision it is to have kids. I hope that maybe they will be able to find a community of their own to support and help one another to what will undoubtedly be a difficult life for all involved."

dbtselfhelp,exavxs7,t3_crtysb,1566117199.0,"One thing to remember is that cannibalism is fairly rare. If you are able to, getting an alarm system might help you to feel safer. As far as the feeling like spiders are crawling on you, perhaps try a night light if you are in a darkened room, or, try putting on lotion or rub your arm against a blanket to feel another sensation. 

Some people find writing out their thoughts to be helpful, such as writing down ""I am afraid that there is someone outside my window coming to eat me and my dogs. But I know that cannibalism is rare and all my doors are locked."" Or ""I think spiders are crawling all over my skin, but I looked, and there are no spiders."" Sometimes the act of typing or writing down the facts can bring them to the forefront of your mind, and not have them get lost in a sea of worried thoughts. 

Also, if it was your therapist that told you to check facts, you can always let them know that that isn't necessarily helpful for you in your situation. Different strategies work well for different people."

HouseMD,ew2g01i,t3_cme9d1,1565045764.0,"1. I liked House more in the earlier seasons when it was more of a procedural medical show, and the lives of the characters were interwoven with the patient's issues. For example, in the Season 2 episode ""The Mistake,"" a patient dies due to a misdiagnosis by Chase who is distracted by the death of his father. 
2. House should have never gotten together with anyone romantically. For me, part of what was interesting about House's character (in the earlier seasons) was the fact that he avoided getting too close to anyone, but there were rare moments when he showed more humanity than expected. This allowed there to be more of a mystery to the character. Plus, there was enough romantic drama going on in the show (Wilson with his wives, Chase and Cameron, Foreman and Thirteen etc.). I felt like it watered down both House's and Cuddy's characters. Cuddy was this totally awesome dean of medicine, skilled af at her job, witty, intelligent, wanting to be a mother but struggling in a very real way, and totally owned her attractiveness. When she got together with House, she was relegated to love interest and another plot device. 
3. While I didn't think that Dominika and House's marriage made a whole lot of sense, and seemed to be just a random bit of drama to throw in there, I thought that the little bit of development of genuinely beginning to like each other for a time there (before House screwed it up) was way more interesting than House and Cuddy's relationship. Dominika's free-spirited energy was a nice contrast to House's cynicism, she proved to be more intelligent than House originally thought, and she brought out some of House's better qualities. 
4. Wilson getting cancer, specifically one with a low mortality rate, although I'm glad that the creator said in an interview that he left the show's ending open-ended on purpose so the audience could draw their own conclusions. House is so full of rare and random medical stuff that it wouldn't surprise me if Wilson did end up surviving. There is an episode of House where one of Wilson's cancer patients who was thought to be terminal, actually went into remission, and this patient was irritated because he was finally living his life to the fullest and now felt limited again. I feel like Wilson would react the same way, as he tries so hard to be normal and controlled all the time. Plus, the show already had doctors with diseases (House still not fully recovered from his infarction, and Thirteen with her Huntington's Disease)."
childfree,ew2c599,t3_cmcxcq,1565043092.0,"Does that mean if someone were to have a baby, your co-worker would adopt it? And if not, she would be in support of social programs that offer government assistance to mothers who are financially unable to pay hospital bills or support the child once they are born? 

Don't get me wrong, no one should be policing anyone on what they can and cannot do with their body, and pregnancy and childbirth cause long-lasting changes to a woman's body as well that take can a very intense emotional and physical toll. 

But beyond that, there are many issues with the foster care system, there are tons of kids who may never get adopted, and for those who want to adopt kids, it is a very long and expensive process. And many people who oppose abortion (not all, but many) are also against government-funded social programs that benefit the mother and the child once they are born. Don't tell me that you oppose abortion and then in the same breath say that we should get rid of free breakfast for kids in public schools. 

Though I am strongly pro-choice, I do try to listen to the arguments of the other side to try and understand their viewpoint. But I just can't wrap my head around the notion that many of those against abortion support the idea of always birthing a child so that the unborn baby may have a chance at a good life, but then turn around and are against actually helping that child have a good life once it's born."

fatlogic,evqpl36,t1_evqgnhs,1564695605.0,"It's honestly difficult without hearing her side at all. 

There are definitely some people who believe in such things as HAES, and honestly do believe they are fine and healthy the way that they are, and that society needs to change in order to fit their unhealthy narrative. I feel like that is what this subreddit generally showcases. 

However, there are individuals who do suffer from something called Binge Eating Disorder, and, individuals who suffer from binge eating as a result of depression or trauma. They don't get as much media coverage as other eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia (despite being statistically more common), and therefore often times people don't consider mental illness when it comes to severe weight gain. 

And the HAES movement doesn't help with that either; being too fat is unhealthy, being too thin is unhealthy. The HAES movement is fighting against decades of too thin models being the standard of beauty, by instead trying to thrust society into the opposite direction of the other end of unhealthy being seen as beautiful. 

I'm not saying either the wife or the husband is right, but, as someone who suffers from mental illness, there does come a point when you need to become aware of how your illness is affecting yourself and others. That being said, I can't tell from the post alone whether or not she has realized this; if she has, it's possible she isn't ready to seek help, and face what caused her to develop her eating issues in the first place. 

Just imo, I don't feel like I have enough info to judge one way or the other. That being said, I commend him for defending his position in a way that is both respectful and honest. Whether her ailment is mental illness or not, it's still important to hear the voices of those affected."
