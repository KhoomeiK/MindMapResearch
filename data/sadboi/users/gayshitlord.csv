Use a spray leave in conditioner. That helps with detangling and gives your hair some hydration as well. 

Try not to use hot water. That dries out your hair and skin and don‚Äôt scruff your hair with the towel. Squeeze/blot/squish your hair dry.

Edit: use a deep conditioner/masque at least once a week. If you tie your hair, use one of those coily hair ties."
