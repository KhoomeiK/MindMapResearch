So tubs have a protective finish of top of the main surface. This creates a smooth surface. Like on a nonstick pan, this smooth surface doesn't have any grit with dirt, and grime to stick to. However once this finish is worn off the tubs surface has a lot of grit. You could likely sharpen a knife on it. This gritty surface collects dirt and grime deep into it's pores and therefore requires it to be hard scrubbed once a week or more to keep it looking clean."

I'm not going to say it's perfect. My desk, nor my bedroom floor is winning awards, but, besides two or three things of trash my brain has gotten forgotten for the moment, it's trash free. Most importantly, the floor doesn't have trash on it, the can isn't constantly overflowing either."
