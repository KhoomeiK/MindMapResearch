I hope you guys got recognized by someone or something for all of that effort that you put into that. It’s not easy to start from scratch. That’s a huge success, and I’m jealous that we can’t do that. If I’m ever at a non-public and have this situation again, I’ll remember this!!"
schoolcounseling,f7fxg3j,t1_f7ft6yn,1573689108.0,"Thank you for your reply! We’re going into year 2 pouring so many supports and interventions into these kids and there’s...just nothing. Rarely I will get a student to be accountable for their actions and I celebrate it like the biggest touchdown in history and make a big deal out of it, and then we’re right back to the nasty remarks. One student cries and gets angry when he is redirected, and then the next day tells me with a PROUD look and “giggle” that he got in trouble again and I can’t make him apologize. Mind you, I have never forced a kid to apologize because then it’s not sincere, I merely strongly suggest. 



We have responded with copious amounts of love and they know I’m available for a break (until they abuse the privilege).  They get clipped down and can’t turn it around and ruin the rest of the class’s learning for the day.  We have an incredibly needy—in the sense of need, not like helpless—school that our resources are stretched thin and I’m trying to support the teachers, but there’s only one of me, and I’m lost. 


Anyway!!! Thank you for your answer! I will suggest that with my teachers. I anticipate: “everyone wants to be my friend. they like me.”"

have you tried caffeine to supplement the antibiotic to keep you awake? i know it’s not the best, but maybe to start out and try to form a new habit.  someone on here said thay caffeine makes their IH significantly worse for a week or so, so i know it’s not for everyone."

idiopathichypersomnia,f1kzl9y,t1_f1kooam,1569543336.0,"when it comes to lists, have you tried a “top 5” instead of a whole to do list?  i love making lists, but definitely get overwhelmed (thus laying down  and falling asleep) and then i wake up feeling more anxious about not having done anything, then i fall back asleep to avoid the anxiety. this is a FUN cycle!!! 

BUT the “top 5” does seem to make me feel a lot more productive and my confidence is higher! 

also, in terms of explaining to others, have you looked up “the spoon theory”?  if you haven’t, google it!!  i’ve showed it to some of my friends and they’ll ask how i’m doing, and i’ll say “well, i only had like 3 spoons today so it’s rough” and they understand.  the article is about invisible illness and lack of energy due to the illness (lupus is the invisible illness here but the analogy works the same!!)"

My heart races when I see a cop on the highway, but in my little rural town, the cops have been portrayed as helpful. I live in a suburb of Philadelphia, and I know that that’s not always the case there.  My “township building” is where the cops are and it’s about 2 minutes away, so growing up I always saw the cops driving around the backroads.  When I was 8 or so, an officer came to say hi to us at my house because he was friendly with my dad and he gave my sister and I each a stuffed cow that said “Don’t moo-ve until you buckle up”.  We always had cops come into our schools to do walk-throughs and say hi to us, so I think that’s another factor—they didn’t try to instill fear into us. When I go into the city I tend to be more nervous around cops, I think it’s due to the weapons they carry, but I am not usually feeling threatened (honestly probably just based on my privileges)."
