I haven't been exposed to gay radiation or bitten by a radioactive drag queen so am a long way from being super gay.

Part of the Introvert/Depression combo is being overwhelmed with stimuli; getting away from that stimuli (co-workers, customers, etc.), is not a bad thing. Yeah, the lack of chemicals in your brain may drive the behavior, but it may not be a negative thing.
I say own it. Make your lunchbreak something to look forward too, pick an episode of something to watch on netflix, or a game on your phone you play only on lunch, or any of a hundred other ""rewards."" Own it, and use it to deal with work, if not the rest of life. You got this."
