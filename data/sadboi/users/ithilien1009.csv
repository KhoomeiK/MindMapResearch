AmItheAsshole,fdw16cr,t1_fdsuh3h,1578753996.0,"Mostly NTA, but I think you should've tried talking to her mom again. Told her one more time why it's important, and then let both of them know that if she won't abide by the rule you'll suspend the license for two years. I think it would've helped for both of them to know the incoming punishment so they had a chance to relent. It sounds like the mom couldn't have done anything to prevent OP since his name's on the paperwork so knowing ahead of time by a day or a few hours even wouldn't have hurt. If the potential to destroy human life isn't worth it to them (which honestly it should be. Ugh), then maybe a longer term limit to her independence would've been. Basically, communicate better with your ex, but I don't fully disagree with your actions. I'm just worried about your daughter ever realizing how wrong she was with her mom on the one side totally agreeing with her mindset and treating you like the bad guy. 

Regardless I can't believe the attitude of these two - especially that her MOM thinks it's OK. I would've been grounded for life if it were me."

relationship_advice,f7cpdnk,t3_dvb91j,1573597168.0,"This is pretty normal when you match well with a person and there's good chemistry, particularly in the first few months. When I started dating my current bf, I had to wait 2 weeks to see him again after our first date and I literally could not stop thinking about him. Never happened to me before. Longest 2 weeks ever.

Enjoy it! Thank you for the wholesome post, what a breath of fresh air."
aww,f5mdest,t1_f5l5fm8,1572288902.0,"When I went to go bring my dog home when she was a pup, her momma caught sight of me from outside and just accusingly watched me through the sliding glass door as I left with her baby. My heart broke. :( 

Granted she may have been fine and I just interpreted it as an accusing look."

I see the year as a giant circle that I'm basically walking around the edge of. I think that counts?"

Also try to attend school events (likes fairs). If you're comfortable, try talking with your classmates, that might lead to being included in group activities. 

The meetup app is also very useful!"
Anxiety,f1mm4lr,t3_d9qsam,1569597089.0,That's awesome! I also have some bad anxiety around the post office (when I have to I'll usually drive to a smaller one so it's not as crazy). Something about how they're organized sets it off. I'm so glad to hear you were able to overcome it! :)
wholesomememes,eu6swne,t3_cf0c33,1563508168.0,"Oh wow, this brought back memories! My dad and I did this if I happened to wake up before he left for work when I was little (he legit would leave at 4:30-5am back then). We'd always have waffles, and he'd cut them for me and make it sound like the waffles were screaming lol. Then he'd tuck me into his spot in bed next to my mom before heading out. 

For a while, I would wake up on purpose just because it was so nice."
FondantHate,es45g6h,t1_es2nqim,1561577493.0,I also agree! It's like requesting a flavor - it's not an unreasonable request. She's offering to make you a cake so I'm sure she wants it be one you'll enjoy more than anything else. :) And I think people who are into baking cakes know that plenty of people don't like fondant.

wholesomememes,eqvpczo,t3_bzp4ac,1560348010.0,"My dad had a Keeshond before I was born. Her name was Puppet and he adored her. But he was in the military and was transferred, and he was going somewhere he couldn't take her. He rehomed her with a farmer he knew would take good care of her, but it broke his heart to drive away and see her watching him leave. It breaks my heart, too. 

He still talks about her a lot, over 30 years later. They're wonderful, sweet dogs <3"
Anxiety,eq2kx9y,t3_bwy074,1559739245.0,"This happened to me a few years ago. It was the kind of interview where they pressure you intentionally to see how you react, and I reacted badly. Totally broke down. I didn't get the job, and I had put a lot of effort into getting it so it was hard to get over - but you know, I learned that role just wasn't for me. I got a better job that I'm much happier with.

Even if you don't get the job, we're all proud of you for stepping out of your comfort zone and making it through to the interview. :) It may be some time, but one day this won't matter anymore and you'll be in a better place."
