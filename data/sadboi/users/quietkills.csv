But I buy supplies for training because why would I want to spend hours trying to find someone with a fellstalk collection when I just want to make potions to use to kill bosses more? 

What I personally like about runescape is that you can do whatever you want. I once met a guy trying to make 100 tmw sets by mining the ore himself. I know people who smelt bars for money because they're afraid of gwd1. I know a lot of people on this sub claim to do Telos or Aod for money, but my best moneymaker has been duo vorago and my friend has spent 5 months trying to get his last orb at 999%."

Doing slayer vs killing rax there's different items that are useful. Like slayer you would want aggro pots possibly but you wouldn't need them for rax. If you're fishing you would want a rod-o-matic or a augmented crystal fishing rod or even tavia's fishing rod if you have invention unlocked, but lots of items have prerequisites. 

I don't know how to explain what items are generally useful because most items are useful in a few scenarios and not everyone is trying to work on trim comp or ""true trim."" Like enhanced Excalibur is useful for any combat, but if you were a level 3 skiller it's pretty useless to obtain.
