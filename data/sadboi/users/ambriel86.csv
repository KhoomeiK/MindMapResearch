In therapy, she will learn how to properly do Kegel exercises which will help her learn to contract and relax her pelvic floor muscles.

This person answered with honesty and it's not something strong enough to keep me holding on to life.

The difficult truth is my soulmate died five years ago and I've been living like a ghost ever since."
