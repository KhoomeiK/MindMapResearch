Discussion,fr3kmen,t3_gma2ha,1589859474.0,"I always be SUPER AGAINST ABORTION. I was an attempted abortion they tried and failed imagine if they succeed. They attempted to drown me in salt water and I think they failed because I am still here. Fuck abortion. My own mother and Doctors who are supposed to protect people tried to murder me in cold blood. If that’s not wrong I don’t know what. And no, men get as much say as a women men create the life just as much as the women therefore they get 50% of the say. It’s not a women’s issue it is a humans issue. If that’s not wrong I don’t know what. I am pissed on the topic of abortion because it is extremely personal to me. Imagine knowing people tried to murder you and their not in jail. I love my mother but she should be in jail. Abortion is wrong plain and simple. Also the argument is stupid about having an abortion because of financial trouble. Are we seriously letting the quality of life dictate if there is life at all. No wrong. By that logic we could kill every homeless person on the street. Because there financially struggling. Plain ignorance and stupidly for people who support abortion. Also I am sorry I know what I wrote comes off as aggressive I just think so lowly of people who support murder and get pissed of by them."

mentalillness,fo933n8,t3_g6d3i7,1587609443.0,I’d recommend over the phone psychiatrist and your in a tough spot I’m not gonna lie. You’ve should try meditation it’s weird but there are not so many options. I’d recommend this because I had the same thing psych wards that you have the power to check in and check out into. It’s not a fun or enjoyable solution but it helped me and I think it will help you. They are state run ones that are nice and I think they might help.
mentalillness,fo92q3z,t3_g6eipm,1587609204.0,Don’t hide it but don’t make it something that’s important or a something that your gonna talk to with everyone find a balance. When you bring it up often it makes someone see you as if they are the illness and it’s who they are. Don’t really make it a conversation just smash it if it brings up.

Honestly I really have to I get into fights I barley know what love is and I’ve got to many this Hs wrong with my brain that this would just break it. Sociopaths emotions are all weakened.

ADHD is when you drift off and you get antsy. The meds they will give if you meet with a psychiatrist help. I’ve been on them for 2ish months and I’ve noticed changes. In my focusing and being able to sit still longer. Also you may think this is normal because I always thought it was. Feeling in your stomach when you get nervous is somethings higher with ADHD. Also I know this sounds weird but please respond to this trust me. Do you say your welcome or does it seem weird to you. Again it’s weird but respond to the last thing.

mentalillness,fny8tzi,t3_g4l1bx,1587356288.0,"Getting back in a relationship with her would create more conflict then you currently have now. Ask her if you can meet her as friends. It would be nice to have her in your life and  I had something similar to this and I did a reddit thing and my friend sent her a screenshot of me doing an a AMA and I was embarrassed but she thought it was sweet and nice. Try to keep her in your life but don’t get into a boyfriend girlfriend relationship. Things fall into place it probably isn’t meant to be. Friends yes, but your 16 and it’s unnecessary conflict. You’ve got plenty of time to think about marriage but 16 is not the time. You should start thinking about marriage in 10 years but not now. You’ve plenty of time and don’t be worrying about that now."
mentalillness,fny7rlb,t3_g4ipn1,1587355514.0,"Meet with a psych a few times and they will give u a diagnosis. For me it was obvious for them but for u I have no clue. They gave me meds and I have not been on them long and I do see a difference in my focus and eating. I lost 20 pounds from the meds and now I have a six pack. Honestly it’s a little weird meeting with a patch but they may give a diagnosis which is good because if there’s a diagnosis, there’s a treatment."

mentalillness,fny7a5s,t3_g4jpwf,1587355169.0,Well meds are meds I’ve been on meds for a while now and that’s the way I think of them. Plain old meds. Who cares about what they do I just take them and don’t think about it. Honestly if u haven’t tried professional help I’d recommend it I do and it helps. If u don’t like to talk to people in person (I don’t) do the online ones they really work. My advice is don’t even worry yourself with the thought of the meds. I know it sounds stupid o but I think I’m By polar. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Anxiety and l am a pathological liar and I have an impulse disorder. The psychologist and I both don’t think that’s all my brain issues. You Really shouldn’t concern yourself with the thought of the meds. It’s unnecessary and it won’t help.  I hope I helped.

I have an impulse disorder and it is blatantly obvious. Loveless relationship with my mother. I’m a very happy person it’s just I have awful ADHD. I take meds which help a lot. I lose a lot of weight because of my meds. I have slight OCD with my body. I won’t stop working out until everything is perfect in my view. Also I lie 24/7 because I’m a compulsive liar so whenever I meet someone I give them a heads up so I’m case I make up an extreme lie they will  know. When I’m older (18) I Think I will live in a Mental Facility because I’m scared that my I will become sociopath and if I do I already have an impulse disorder and a lot of killers are sociopaths so I’m super nervous. Honestly I think that’s my best option. My mental health has shaped my life negatively. I hate it with all my heart and my mental health as been on a downhill in the past 3 years. I admit I lied in this once. It was the OCD body thing. But this is the first time I have admitted to one. I’m honestly super nervous for my future but I know one thing that I’m bright and I’m not terrible now things are going O.K so I have slight faith that I won’t have to live locked up. I still believe it is the best option if a psychiatrist ever tells me I’m a sociopath. The other thing that worries me is I’m the best fighter. I took jujitsu and Krav Maga and self de dense classes formed years so if I get into an extreme fight I’m nervous I will lose it. I know my response didn’t really answer the question but I hope tris will do. I didn’t have a shitty childhood that’s a big overstatement. I just have had a loveless relationship with my mother my life. We never get along and she has temper problems. My family is wealthy and my father and I are super close. I have a lot of friends and I’m somewhat popular. I’m an all state wrestler because of how much I work out and my fighting background helped make me better. I went 48-0 in the past year and a half. Whatever the future holds I’m ready to fight back. The way I see it is if my mental health is the worst stage is the worst thing in my life, it’s not too bad. I’m not crazy I’m just a little off and off but I got friends a girlfriend and I’ll live. Sorry for the grammar errors it’s not worth editing it."

It will just be transferred to another person. I don’t want those people to have to deal with my suffering. Also I don’t want to. I talked to a psychologist over the phone who was nice and chill. We didn’t even talk about mental health we just talked  about random stuff and that was their intent. Since I was 12 my mental health has been spiraling out of control and I hope that you don’t make the decision because East f the pain.
