mentalillness,fo8fam4,t3_g5u81m,1587595451.0,you're definetly not the only one I find myself getting annoyed a lot. eve. if its just people being nice to me. I haven't cried because of it but people have been telling me that I seem more aggressive
mentalillness,fo8ck2f,t3_g68u9q,1587593976.0,I completely agree. I cant really add much because I'm not diagnosed and I don't want to be THAT person but at least our school psychologist (who just can't diagnose people) has said I show a lot of symptoms and should go look for someone who can diagnose me after quarantine. I feel more empty and dreadful than sad usually. it's gotten to the point where I enjoy being sad and angry because everything is better than just feeling hollow and pointless. so yeah BEING SAD IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM BEING DEPRESSED
mentalillness,fmw2n5o,t1_fmhwbf4,1586438098.0,Thank you so much! I've been sleeping with the light on the lowest setting and now I can sleep for about 5 hours! (which might not seem like much but it is a lot for me since I usually barely get 2) I still go to sleep very late (or early since its usually 4am) but it's been getting better. Thank you so much! :)
mentalillness,fmmfasd,t1_fmme44l,1586204223.0,"I am not 100% sure but mental illness runs in my family and I'm pretty sure the trigger for it was my parents divorce five years ago. It's weird to explain but often times you find yourself in a bubble of negative thoughts and drown out all the positivity. It's hard to get out of that place even when other people tell you that there is more to life than sadness, anger and emptiness. 

I do art too! And sometimes I still enjoy it but it's just not as satisfying as it used to be and I can't get myself motivated or inspired much anymore.

The sleeping thing is a bit hard to answer. I've never slept well even when I was a kid I'd have trouble sleeping. I've always been rather paranoid and that often forces me to pull all-nighters but that could be just my case. Thoughts keep me awake as well but it's usually the feeling of bei g watched that is the problem"
mentalillness,fmmdome,t3_fw324d,1586203403.0,"I haven't been diagnosed since I've only talked to our school psychologist but she said I show a lot of of the symptoms (but she is not qualified for giving me a diagnosis) for me it's like this: 

I often feel empty. Not even sad just hollow. Like nothing is real and everything is foggy and there is no point in anything. I stopped enjoying a lot of my hobbies and have been sleeping less and less because I can't fall asleep and have trouble staying asleep. This meads to me being more tired and everything becomes foggier and the cycle repeats.

Does this make sense? I'm open if you have any more questions"
mentalillness,fmhvw48,t1_fmhvlze,1586095222.0,Thank you for the advice! Sadly I can't really go buy one right now but I'll look into it once I get the courage to tell my mother about this
MakeMeSuffer,fj624ps,t3_fbk4pr,1583052961.0,Ahh I thought it was watermelons. Then I saw the brackets.... Then I saw the subreddit. I have braces and now I'm scared
