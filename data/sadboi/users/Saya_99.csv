unpopularopinion,fp8t8mg,t3_gbyvmz,1588402217.0,"I agree. I think the word ""survivor"" should apply only to rape victims that really had their life in danger (they were brutally beaten, drugged, etc.). I see that some people say that the word ""survivor"" is used so that it is not used the word ""victim"". Well, while I agree that the word ""victim"" may be harmful to some people, I think that replacing it with the word ""survivor"" isn't the solution eighter, because then you diminish the experience that the people who really had their life in danger had gone through. You can't compare a sexual harassment with brutal rape or any other similar scenario, let's be honest.

Another thing I see here is that the word ""survivor"" is used, because people survived the trauma, that meaning they became suicidal and they survived that. Yes, but it's still not a sexual assault survivor. It's a suicide survivor. There is a difference between the two.

 I think we should think of a better way to use terms, as the way we use them now is pretty misleading."

What helped me was the fact that, as I started posting more, I also had posts with positive feeback, when I thought that they will actually criticise it. I started understanding that I am conditioned to think of the worst scenario (I tend to do it even in real life situations). I actually felt really good when people would approve my point or would find my jokes funny or they would engage in debates and I started caring less if there would be negative comments or not. It's more fulfilling for me when I post/comment something and see that people are supportive, they engage in a conversation (with a different point of view or not), when they say ""I didn't think of it that way"", etc. I tend to feel a lot that my ideas, jokes and opinions are plain stupid and it helps me to see that, sometimes, people don't see them that way."

This way, you can introduce a new hobby without overwhelming yourself. Also, I think it is a good idea to do them when you are in a good disposition and not when you are sad, mad, etc. That's because we associate feelings with behaviours and events. By repetitive exposure, we can teach ourselves to feel in a certin way about something. If before you start doing recreative activity you do something that really makes you feel good or relaxes you and then you procede to watch, for example, a series, not imediately, but over time, you should start feeling more and more relaxed watching series.
