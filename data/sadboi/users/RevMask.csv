Walk in, see that one wall had something spray painted on it. Just random letters and stuff. Not anything we could read. We looked at the other walls to see any other letters, words, signs, anything. Nothing.

So we go in deeper, nothing exciting. More trash on the floors, occasional discarded bottle. So we started walking out the way we came in. Now the opposite wall had something spray painted. Wasn't there before. We had checked the walls. Some big symbol we didn't recognize.
