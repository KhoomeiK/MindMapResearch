thebeachboys,fqx1zn8,t3_glcwdt,1589723911.0,"It's an oft discussed topic (maybe the biggest ""what-if?"" in rock history) but one I've never contrubuted to. 

iirc Vegetables was an intended single? *I* think it's a banger but I wonder how the world would've felt about the pops and smacks and quasi-satirical subject matter. Surf's Up would have been a moody single, but I think it has the ""wow"" factor. Other than that, maaaybe Wind Chimes? Like you said, there aren't many ostensible bops on the album. 

I think the artistic merit of the album is absolutely unquestionable. I personally believe it blows Sgt. Pepper out of the water in depth of thematic/motivic songwriting and qualitative consistency (And I *love* sgt pepper). I also think Smile's material is more interesting than Pet Sounds; it's like an extension of PS's incredible recording methodology to more abstract and grandiose music. 

It's pretty clear that Brian was giving everything he had when he was writing and recording these songs. I choose to believe that effort would have paid off, especially given the contemporary public's embrace of a higher-art album like Pepper."

I may have a more full response tomorrow. In the meantime I'd be interested to hear what genres you think AC may have ""invented,"" since I feel like most of their releases have some degree of genre precedent (or that I can't point to a musical movement that they seem to have originated).

Also what do you mean when you say ""truly abstract music""? Do you mean truly novel/original? I wouldn't say the music AC is known for (Sung Tongs - MPP stretch) could be called abstract per se, nor do I think that's a *necessarily* favorable descriptor for music. I think I see what you mean though. AC's music is more layered/oblique/dense than MGMT's, but I think both bands make fascinating songs by different metrics.

Little Dark Age is excellent, running the sort of twisted psych-pop pastiche in the Ariel Pink sphere (who was a big collaborator for the album).

They've just got a perfectly-sized discography that's not TOO large to hear all of, but it remains immensely varied and consistently interesting. Just as they grew and changed as musicians, it feels like your relationship with them as a listener grows and changes as well. 

I get the same sort of fascination with older bands like the Beach Boys (who have a WAY more immersive discography than they typically get credit for, far beyond pet sounds). But you're right it's hard to find contemporaries that consistently scratch the same itch.

It all probably depends on the music you preferred before listening to AC. Most of us probably came to AC through some flavor of indie. For me Radiohead and Tame Impala formed a springboard. Anyone with a prior palette for dark, psychedelic ambient music would probably immediately love HCTI. 

I thank God I gave it more than 1 chance, cause I did NOT understand that shit at first. I truly can't put it over Feels or Sung Tongs, but it has steadily risen from like 8th to 3rd for me.

The last point you mentioned about the ultimate meaninglessness of MU %'s is something I certainly agree with though. Melee has too many degrees of freedom per frame for anyone to rightfully conclude anything about it. (We barely know what CHESS plays are objectively good, and the degrees of freedom in chess are *staggeringly* lower per turn than those in melee.)

2025 melee (which I suspect will be alive and healthy) is going to certainly have a different meta-landscape and thus different community-matchup opinions. But ultimately these are just stepping stones. Melee is a game of infinite layers, so I'm all for trying to solve a matchup rather than give up on it.

However, regarding competitors who make melee their livelihood, I would never cast aspersions for switching characters in a hard matchup (this is actually just fgc 101, smashers just seem to have much more consternation about it). 

My only point is that complaining gets very stale at a certain point, at least as a twitter user haha. I think Leffen specifically engenders a whole generation of Fox mains (many of whom can't even shffl consistently) who think that they become BETTER (i.e. more like leffen) by complaining to the degree he does. 

Leffen is an incredible player, he knows what he is talking about. But I think the issue with the smash community (probably every fgc community to some extent, but I see it much more in smash) is that people seek scapegoats for losing. Many players never get over that hump, but I think the best certainly have.

Again, I will reiterate that the cheapening of Zain's skill (at least from TOP melee foxes, because we can ultimately discard the opinions people who say he is lame and carried) is *implicit.* It's very subtle---it ultimately doesn't affect anything except for the minds of new players, thus perpetuating the myth that any matchup is unsolvable.

I do love talking about this, but if you want to DM me for more conversation you can feel free."
SSBM,fmz69f5,t1_fmyqurc,1586508041.0,"I agree, I think complaining is an extremely natural way to process difficulty. But no one plays 100%, I think it is a false premise. Zain isnt playing 100% either, he makes mistakes every set. Zain is simply better than Cody, and I only see him (cody) admit that when asked directly. Zain, on the other hand, will admit being outplayed FIRST, then go on to work on a matchup (sans complaining).

I truly think mango or Armada's foxes (with some derusting and practice) could still handle Zain (despite it being UNWINNABLE per cody/leffen). Of course this is decently theoretical, mango plays falco and armada plays ultimate. But they are both better than Zain (though not by much and maybe not for long)


I think what sets the melee's highest echelon of players (mango, zain, hbox, plup, leffen, and armada still) is a separation of pride from their play. Leffen of course seems to be a counterexample, but I think even his massive ego takes a backseat to his willingness (and natural ability) to improve. iirc leffen has a pretty even record vs zain, and he certainly EVISCERATES every other marth on the planet (even though the matchup is unwinnable). No one wants to admit that Zain got very good very fast, so they scramble to find explanations like Marth is broken. 

I honestly think they realize this now. After a while complaining gets you nowhere, so I think we'll see leff and cody and fiction suck it up and play a different character. Zain will still try his hardest to win, and that's why I respect him so much as a competitor.

pavement,flaa66s,t1_fl9soea,1584979825.0,"with the resurgence of the bubonic plague we havent been able to get physical copies made, but we WOULD love to. 

Our dream is to press 250 or 500 records, it doesnt take THAT many sales to break even on a venture like that."
pavement,fl9dsbh,t1_fl8w7me,1584951109.0,"haha we had what we THOUGHT was a really sick demo, which is on spotify but it is like worse than bee thousand level recording, plus the songs are not full formed or recorded in isolation lmao. But it was still very helpful to make---if you know anyone who can record a shit demo or if you can do it yourself, it helps venues and recording engineers understand you lol. 

But our demo was made my just a homie a bit older than us named Matt Villiott, it was just a new experience for everyone and we apl felt a lot of pride over it. Plus it got much more traction than expected lol, though that was mostly devoted friends nobly pumping numbers all night while they slept lmao. 

We had heard about a local recording engineer in Charlottesville named Matt Wyatt, who was new to recording super loud distorted shit, just as we were new to recording ANYTHING in a studio (he has a sick home studio, a dream of mine. 

Fortunately recording went eerily well. We were explicit in how we wanted it to sound, and he rolled perfectly with it. And it just was easier than expected, which is not everyone's experience but I'm pleased it was mine. 

U can DM me if you want more pacifics on the matter"
pavement,fl8bjtu,t1_fl7hwx9,1584919970.0,"Just wanted to say thanks to you guys for all the support! Even one compliment would have made it all worth it for us, so this really means a ton.

Unsurprisingly the Guided By Voices facebook group boomers were very kind as well lmao, but indieheads is being a douchebag and deleting my posts LOL. 

As of now, I am trying to get Bob Nasty to listen to it in (high) hopes that he and the whole band hear, lmao. Would seriously be a dream come true.

Edit: plus, if anyone has any basic questions (because I LITERALLY am not an expert, I am only good at answering basic questions; go figure) about getting an album recorded, especially if you're busy with college or a job or getting a job, I can certainly offer my fractionally sage wisdom. This shit is kinda pulling yourself up by your boostraps to do (which is almost totally impossible according to newton iirc), but it is ultimately its own reward. 

Moreover, I know many feel they had good music they could make and release if they just got started, so I hope to stand as a testament to that being doable even if you're a lazy fuck by nature (I am)."
pavement,fl7ic7l,t1_fl7hjg7,1584902337.0,"He is incredible! I just loved Fun Trick Noisemaker and Wowee Zowee so much, and I knew he was Charlottesville based, so I reached out to him. 

We only told him our band name and album title, and other than that gave him free rein. We all think he fucking nailed it, it really is quite beautiful."
pavement,fl7hwx9,t3_fn4eyb,1584902086.0,"Sup guys! The band is called Spillway and the album is called Normal Day Any Day. If you just wanna listen and don't give a FUCK about the backstory, we are on every major streaming service under the sun. 

Like Pavement and Silver Jews of the days of yore, we are a Charlottesville-based band of students at the University of Virginia. We get our jollies trying to revive 90s/80s indie rock, something I think is clearly reflected in the album's sound. We kind of just stitched together whatever ideas we liked into songs of our own creation, which was incredibly fun.

Our band is a 4 piece with 3 guitarist/bassist/vocalist/songwriters and 1 Ringo Starr (but better). As such, each songwriter has 3 songs they primarily wrote and sing lead on the album (if you're curious, my tracks are 3, 5, and 8). Our musical interests form a Venn Diagram with a large center (indie, shoegaze, space rock, punk), but each of us has our own bread and butter we go home to (I love Animal Collective and 60s shit, whereas my mate likes Title Fight and crazy-ass hardcore shit like Jesus Piece).

We do think it turned out unironically good, which is a far cry better than we had expected. It has been a major victory for us and I hope at least 1 of you guys enjoys it!"

(hopefully this fits appropriate formatting my apologies)

Some info about us:

We are a 4 piece of college students at the University of Virginia (we are seniors now). Our shared influences are 90s indie (Pavement, Guided by Voices, Silkworm) but we also incorporate elements of hardcore, shoegaze, psych, and space rock.

We have 3 primary songwriters, each of which plays guitar, bass, or vocals depending on the song. We also have a drummer. (If you're curious, my songs are The Whole Everything, Lift this Sentiment, and Grey Waltz.)

The album art was done by the incredible Steve Keene (he also did Pavement's Wowee Zowee and Apples In Stereo's Fun Trick Noisemaker). We were stoked to work with him.

Moreover we're stoked it's finally out. Like rings of a tree, I think one can see our growth in this album (some songs date back to 2016, we've known each other long). We are proud of ourselves, and hope people get to hear it.

Thanks to anyone who's read this much or given us a listen, you make our world go around."
