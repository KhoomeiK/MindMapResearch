AskReddit,fhtwzzc,t3_f4gsxv,1581879346.0,When I was 12 I decided to “ride” on a hotel gym treadmill. Set it to the slowest setting and sat on the tread riding it down getting up and riding it back down again. The last time I put my hand down to stand and my right pinky got caught in the plastic piece that covers the “turnover space” where the tread loops back around. It was stuck between the hard plastic and the running tread which was essentially sandpapering down my skin. I was the only one in the gym and I couldn’t reach the cord to cut the power so I was stuck screaming as my pinky skin got worn down to the bone and I tried to free it. My pinky eventually broke from the pressure. After about 5 mins my dad arrived to find me screaming and unplugged the machine.

datingoverthirty,fhczfql,t1_fhbi6uq,1581474089.0,"Ugh, I'm sorry that sucks.  I found diving back into apps after my breakup helped for literally a day or so, then made me feel shitty again (and paranoid I'd run into my ex on them), so I'd fully recommend the taking a break strategy especially since it's so new.."
datingoverthirty,fhcz63k,t1_fhbi0ul,1581473928.0,"I feel you... my strategy for that when the times comes is just to be a bit more specific on the apps... see if that helps?  Trim down the amount of dates i'm actually doing, and the amount of time/mental energy I'm putting into chatting/matching before.  Who knows if that'll help at all."
datingoverthirty,fhcywaa,t1_fhbpm79,1581473764.0,"We sound very similar.  Big conflict in my last relationship was about alone time/space, particularly when it came to nights/week we'd do sleepovers.  I can only hope it's a strength to be self-sufficient in a routine and think of life as different chapters where focus is applied in different directions.  Some people never get that (settle early and live their lives) so it's good to think of this as a luxury i think?"

Apps also destroy my self worth, so think I may be done with those for awhile. Did you feel pangs of wanting to go out on a date/etc during this period?

Anxiety,fej9o3n,t3_epeqlv,1579163018.0,I deal with this a lot. Ssri was the only thing that ever stopped my heart from pounding long term. I used to have to sit up in bed at night to sleep because my heart pounded so hard I felt like I was drowning/ getting too much blood to my head. Also have some  OCD in the family so could be related to that.
relationship_advice,fe6mcrz,t3_enx1sn,1578895805.0,"Not that this is necessarily your business but is she being treated for it? Medication or therapy? 

Just be understanding and supportive, like it sounds like you are. I have pretty acute anxiety, and before I got on medication I would have a racing heart at night and in the morning, often to the point where I’d have to sit up in bed, get up and walk around, or take a Xanax. I’ve left SO’s houses in the middle of the night for that reason much like she did. It sucks and there’s really no rhyme or reason for it a lot of the time. Just making it clear you understand and feel for her and aren’t judging her or making her feel guilty for needing space to calm down.

Update/add: also for the record, Xanax is a very useful drug as long as she has no risk for abuse. It’s about the only thing that stops my spin outs, especially at night."

relationship_advice,fbiv64e,t3_edmirz,1576915834.0,"Not an expert on this by any means but I completely understand how you feel. If you can afford it/have access to it, I would recommend therapy (what I’m doing), and generally trying to focus on gratitude/mindfulness meditation if you are into any of that stuff. Sometimes it can be helpful to really focus on the positives in a relationship, especially once it’s comfortable. You’re not abnormal at all, this is something I’m going through now as well (31/M) but don’t beat yourself up too much or overanalyze! I also found listening to relationship podcasts helpful (Relationship Advice, or Being Well w Rick Hansen)"
antidepressants,f80kq4z,t3_dy9srz,1574131375.0,"I’ve been on Trintellix for about 6 months now and have found it to be pretty good all around. I was on Lexapro, and Wellbutrin preciously, but found trintellix to be all around a less “intense” drug to get onto during the initial 6-8 weeks. Big side effect that seems to make or break it for people is nausea — it wasn’t horrible for me, and it’s since gone away, but some ways to help with that are to take some tums when you take the med, take the med on a full stomach, maybe have some peppermint mints around/peppermint tea, since those help w nausea too. But my trick for the beginning was to try to take it at night and conk out before I felt much of anything nausea wise. 

I’ve had very few, if any, side effects otherwise. And the half life for the medication is very long, so if you miss a dose, or are off by a few hours, you are totally fine!"
ADHD,f0p1mry,t1_f0o3p1l,1568825170.0,"Thanks for this. Really helpful in terms of a couple things -- I've been trying to embrace trying not to ""fix"" her (or anyone), so the idea that her not wanting to work on herself isn't necessarily a bad thing empirically, it's just not ideal for the relationship, is a good way of thinking about it. Also, prioritization is important I think, too. If you can't park on the street because your car will get towed for over 6 months, maybe just pay the registration fee? Anyways, thanks :)"
ADHD,f0p19jn,t1_f0o2swb,1568824933.0,"Thanks so much for the input. I think right now we're both so clouded with the emotional availability of it all (on my side), that it's exceedingly difficult to get anything through to her, even if it's something that's really important for me to communicate. It's a tough place to be. But thinking long term is helpful, and I know neither of us would want to continue on like this for a long term relationship. Thanks again."
ADHD,f0p0zlw,t1_f0oa9h6,1568824757.0,"For sure. I am so willing to accept & work with that with her (and try, gently, to help her institute some helpful habits), I just tend to get frustrated when the spotlight is turned onto my OCD and there's no sense of responsibility at all.  I'm not asking her to take the blame for those things necessarily, I know they are, to an extent, out of her control, but not recognizing them as even being trends it a whole different issue I think she needs help with."
