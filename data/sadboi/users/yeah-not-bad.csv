Anxiety,fm4t1w4,t3_ft0dck,1585760281.0,"I don’t think this ‘friend’ deserves you. That’s not something you send round to people, imo. It’s not something you film, but let’s not get into that... lose the friend, you don’t need people like that."
Anxiety,fm4svcm,t3_ft1010,1585760189.0,"Lay back on your bed, and relax every muscle in your body. Let gravity pull you into your mattress and feel your blankets over your body. Breathe as deeply and evenly as possible. If your mind wanders, that’s OK, just bring it back. If you don’t fall asleep, that’s OK too, your body and mind are still resting, this is still of a benefit to you. Stay there and do this for as long as you can, it may help you feel better, if it doesn’t help you fall asleep. You’re doing so much better than you think you are."
Anxiety,fm4sgmr,t3_ft2blq,1585759972.0,"Try not to worry, because that will only make it worse. My anxiety mainly gives me physical symptoms (fatigue, twitches, sore muscles, lumps in my throat, loose poos, etc) and boy-oh-boy my anxiety is thriving off this. I can promise you that you’re not alone, and you are doing your absolute best to protect yourself. It’s amazing that you are being so cautious, there are so many out there who could learn a thing or to from you! You’re doing so much better than you think you are; I promise."
Anxiety,fm4rtg3,t3_ft35dk,1585759635.0,That seriously looks brilliant! I’d 100% buy that in a little independent shop. Keep it up!
Anxiety,fm4rp38,t3_ft398z,1585759571.0,"It’s OK to feel all of your emotions, maybe write them down so they don’t follow you around for days. 

Sit down on something like a chair/lay down on your bed. Un-tense everything in your body, let gravity pull you into your bed/seat. Breathe as big and as deep as you can and close your eyes. If your mind wanders, that’s ok, just pull it back and focus on your breathing. Then tell yourself that you are doing so well, despite how you feel right now. 

Because you are, you’re doing SO WELL. x"
Anxiety,flec3a7,t3_fob7w1,1585081511.0,"My anxiety has started producing symptoms that mirror the coronavirus and my last 24 hours have been a rollercoaster. I here you completely. I think it’s safe to say that you will know if you have it, practise safe distancing wherever possible and WASH YOUR HANDS! This will pass!"
Anxiety,flebugp,t3_foba85,1585081375.0,"I’m similar, started with a tickly cough 5 minutes after being told about yesterday’s PM broadcast... very mild odd feeling of ‘a lump in my throat’ kind of tickle. This was intermittent at best. Then today it was fine as I worked from home, but then got worse when I was told I had to return to work tomorrow. Coincidence is a fickle thing, and not helpful right now... I also have an ‘urge’ to cough too sometimes and suffer with similar ‘ticks and habits’ so I am thinking that it all points in one direction... ANXIETY. 😓 Stay safe."

Anxiety,fkntmx5,t1_fknt4z2,1584373670.0,"Yeah, I’m struggling atm, ngl, but these hard times will pass. I have a post it next to my pc at work that simply states ‘you’re doing so well, despite what you think. Keep going’ and that helps me so much. All the best to you 🙂."
Anxiety,fknp3c7,t3_ee90a1,1584370893.0,"Yeah... on and off for quite a bit now. It comes and goes for me, but hasn’t gone yet this time."
Anxiety,fknoyyv,t3_exyvrw,1584370812.0,"Yeah... I had tics and habits when I was younger (probably anxiety, then too) and I am currently struggling to get rid of the tensing of the back of my head/neck. I also have mild TMJ so this is a lovely mess when it all gets together. I have stopped tensing in the past, but right now I just can’t stop it, nor can I seem to relax either. Troubling times don’t help anxious minds. At least we know we’re not alone 🙂"

It was actually my second *ever* cross stitch project, and boy did I bite off more than I could chew! It drove me insane at times, while giving me much needed escapism.

Anxiety,exyl9o9,t3_curgg6,1566653562.0,Do you have a phone number to contact the school you’ve applied to? Can you call them and ask if the system is down? Is it a weekend/bank holiday where you are?
Anxiety,exykmlb,t3_cus2ze,1566653335.0,"Have you tried talking to a Doctor? They may be able to advise you to groups or counsellors that can help you to get over some of your fears? 

You aren’t failing, you have your whole life in front of you... 5 years ago had an anxiety breakdown meaning I couldn’t work for 2 months. Now, I’m 24, engaged and bought a home with my partner, who helped me through it all. 

Everything is relative and your situation isn’t the same as mine, but I was unable to leave the house, riddled with anxiety and going through so much. 

Take comfort in the fact that nothing is permanent, and you aren’t missing out on anything that you can’t experience at a later date, when you’re ready."
Anxiety,exyjyc2,t3_cus9cz,1566653099.0,"Don’t forget that you both need to adjust to this change. Dogs are easily adaptable, but it does take time, same with us humans... we might take longer, being slightly more aware than dogs. 

Try to remember that the dog loves you with all of its heart, as dogs are amazing therapy... try to hone in on that and remember that whenever your anxiety flares up. You’ll both get there 🙂"
Anxiety,exyjgkt,t3_cushq5,1566652921.0,"I have had anxiety for about 4/5 years now... my anxiety symptoms are generic, but I have issues with aches and tension, when I’m anxious, I tense muscles/limbs like; my back, my shoulders, my right foot... currently it’s the right side of my face, and it’s getting quite bad. 

Just relax, breathe and know that there is nothing wrong with you, your just struggling. If you had the flu, you’d be in bed... so take care of yourself when your mind isn’t quite ok..."
Anxiety,exyi7u9,t3_cut70r,1566652494.0,"Great place to post and to start, ‘fuck it’ is an emotion that I have utilised quite a bit. I’ve been there, and I am debatably there again myself. Be patient with yourself, we never know how long things will take to get back together, and trust in yourself that it will get better. 

Try to think about how you want to feel, not how you used to feel... I am not the person I was 5 years ago... I am now living in my ‘new normal’. That was a life saver for me... finding my ‘new normal’ and celebrating the teeny-tiny baby steps. 

Stay hydrated, our brains need water too, it’s an organ after all! Try talking to your friends, it’s up to you how much you tell them, but real and true friends will understand if you need to take a step back. 

Keep going, you’re probably doing better than you’d think."
