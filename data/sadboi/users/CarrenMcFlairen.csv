PvZGardenWarfare,fqqvlu7,t1_fqqtq0u,1589572753.0,Will you just stop? Your argument is pointless by this point. It's painfully obvious you think that a sniper shouldn't be able to snipe and that you should be able to 1v1 a scientist at POINT BLANK RANGE because that's how ya do it apparently. Sure if you're a suicide player that's THE way to go but not unless you cared about actually killing the other player. You have to STRATEGIZE in order to prevail against others and it certainly sounds like you're refusing to accept that basic fact of adapting to the situation at hand. I'm sorry but if you keep getting killed by the same player over and over and can't figure out how to change up your approach then I think you're missing the point of strategy.

No, of course Jesus doesn't want us to suffer and yes I do pray over various things that I need improvement in or for someone else especially when I worry for them but one just remember that God has us the way we are to shape us and who we are. I've suffered intense anxiety all my adolescent life, I now can give people advice who are in the boat I once partook of. Strangely enough, everything has its own reason for being and I am content with just letting God take me wherever, ya know? When I think of it, I'm not afraid to die but I don't want to let God down though I know I am not, and of course will never be perfect and that's ok, I know it is. I've asked God to direct people who need to talk to me because I can empathize with their pain and give solid advice. My life may not sound glamorous and who knows, I might die early!
