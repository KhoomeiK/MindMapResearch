We used to use a pill gun/syringe (i’ll link one below), which will kinda shoot it far enough that it’s easier for them to swallow than spit it out! If you press lightly on the sides of their of the jaw hinges, push down gently on the lower jaw and they will open their mouths, so do that with one hand and pop the pill in with the syringe with the other. Also best way i found was to sit on your knees/feet, and secure them with your legs between the gap (lightly of course!) just so they can’t back out and wriggle around too much. She won’t be happy, though learning how to do it quickly will keep any additional fussing from scaring her!
