I've smoked a joint and then was offered a mirror full of coke, I was always like ""no way man. I'm not even gonna pollute my body with an energy drink, keeping it all natural man."" But everytime I was offered a mirror full of coke while I was drunk, I inhaled the whole thing and it seems like a great idea at the time"
