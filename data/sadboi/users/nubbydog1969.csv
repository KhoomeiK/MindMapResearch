I'm not suggesting that you break up with him, but be aware/cognizant of it and tell him how you feel. It's hard to make a person change,  and it's hard to tell someone that you don't like their argument style, but it's important to you, so don't let him dismiss it.  His behavior seems very immature and manipulative. It is a form of gaslighting. I guess you need to decide what your comfort level is with it, and keep in mind that it can intesify as time goes on.  

It seems harmless enough, especially if he is charming, but just know that it could be indicative of some very serious problems later. He was so charming that when I left my marriage, my parents didn't believe any of what I was telling them in terms of his treatment of me. They spent the first couple of  Christmases at his house while I was alone.  That was really hard.  Just goes to show you how powerful someone like that can be. My ex refused to pay child support in NY where it's a law. I took him to court and he CRUSHED ME. I lost everything, including custody. I'm not trying to scare you, but people who manipulate and like to have control are typically heartless...as is my ex.

just my $0.02.

relationship_advice,f5rd23o,t3_don688,1572392293.0,"As someone just finishing a three year divorce in the court system, be very careful.  Lawyers are not all created equal. Make sure the one you hire has got your back no matter what. I had one who got pissed off because I wanted to avoid a trial, so he threw me under the bus in private chambers discussions with the judge causing her to order supervised visits.  It was absolutely RIDICULOUS. I am not an unfit mother; I'm a public school teacher (20 years) and a mandated reporter of child abuse in New York State.  If I were you, I would interview several attorneys and go by word of mouth and referrals from people you know, not by random reviews or bullshit on a website. If I have learned anything throught this process, it's that attorneys can be scum sucking bottom feeders who go for the juglar (your bank account) and kick you when you're down. I'm not trying to scare you, just make you aware, because my attorney did more FAR harm than good. 

With all of that said, alimony/manitenence is likely the only thing to be affected by your wife's actions. Child support is for the child/children and if you want to avoid paying it (keep in mind-she will have no accountibility in terms of how she spends your hard earned money) you need to get custody. My ex is a lying, scheming, evil piece of shit, and because he formed an alliance with the attorney for the child, the two were able to alienate my child from me, after which counseling was ordered by the court.  Ultimately my son came around, but despite having repaired our relationship, the attorney for the child lied in court stating that our son wanted to live with his dad and my ex ended up getting custody. So now I pay him child support despite the fact that he makes nearly two times what I do. Needless to say, the amount of unnecessary drama caused a lot of strain on my relationship with my boy. He did not know who to believe. He was even suicidal at one point. 

The bottom line is this: anything is possible. If you think the justice system is just, you are dead wrong. Get your ducks in a row and get custody. Make it a swift process because the alternative will be BRUTAL on your children."
