summonerschool,flwpypi,t3_frlgm5,1585560432.0,"If you really feel you are bad mechanically speaking, play simpler champs. Garen, annie, yi, leona, ashe, jinx, amumu.
This way it will be more about learning the macro of the role you are playing.
Learn to play aggro when ahead, to play safe when behind, to take opportunities and get all your limits. 
You will lose while limit testing but you will learn.

Also, there are certain champs that don't fit in low elo so consider that sometimes it is better to play early, short term power spike champions, because everyone wants to fight 24/7. I had games in my smurf with kassadin and cassio that were frustrating af how I only wanted to charge my tear to start fighting but my teammates didn't have the patience for it"

summonerschool,fddhvws,t1_fdd4k6a,1578312954.0,"Meh, I actually dislike HOW the game is played in normals vs ranked, it is actually really annoying to play with and against people ranting about you doing dives , rotations, flashy predictions or camping because ""dude chill it's a normal""

Think of it as the difference between playing poker with and without any money involved. People don't play smart or patiently so the half the essence of the game is lost there.

I used to have some limbo periods of the seasons where I didn't feel like ranking because I was playing poorly but wanted to rank, luckily now I can flex with friends and it's so fun how everyone take so seriously even though the matchmaking is the same fiesta as normal"

My family doesn'y care at all about me as long as i'm ""okay"". I just need a warm contact and a fullfilling personal chat about things that passion me. I just do college in autopilot mode, and I do it very well but it feels so fucking dull. Loneliness is such a deadly poison."
