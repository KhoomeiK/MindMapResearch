It turns out that the headphones issue won’t work for me because it causes me to dissociate and I don’t think there is a single thing wrong with me for being open about that.

I’m really confused by your motives here. I realize that everyone on here has their own issues, but I am comfortable saying that your comments aren’t helpful or productive. I am lucky that, while I am reaching out about trauma issues on a cptsd forum, I am in a space where I can handle someone giving judgemental or unproductive feedback when I’m being honest and vulnerable and reaching out for help.

You could also do something to different in your bathroom- decorate the space in a way with the intention of creating something that feels like a gift to yourself.  Make the process of decorating it a ritual of sorts- put intention into giving it back to you. You could even incorporate art therapy- paint the walls by hand, or make a painting to hang in there that helps you keep grounded.

If the nudity plus the bathroom is the challenge, maybe just be a little more gentle.

I think it’s all tied up into basically being obsessed with food. Eating disorders often stem from something else entirely, but an obsession with food is often what it amounts to (be it eating it, not eating it, what/when/where).

I have basically all of the same ‘quirks’ you described. They have gotten better at times but they are definitely alway in my head. 

One thing I hate is people who eat really slow- it’s excruciating for me to be finished and watch the other person still eating. To the point that I have even told my partner outright ‘if you want that, you better eat it faster’ because I knew I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off his plate as soon as I finished mine.

BingeEatingDisorder,fq71n85,t3_ggpsg9,1589140623.0,"For me, my battle with control drives a lot of my person issues (ED included) I’ve been dealing with it for about 25 years now, and I have approached it a million different ways.

Just this week, I managed to successfully break up a cycle of night binging that had gone on for a month.

I’m working on letting go of control in other parts of my life and what that looks like. This randomly inspired me the other day to wake up first thing in the morning and ask myself ‘What do I need today to help me not binge tonight?’ Not ‘how do I control it’ - But what do I need?

I’ve never framed it this way form myself, even though I know logically that unmet needs and binging do correlate. 

I’ve also been doing a lot of ‘self parenting’ in therapy and it’s helped me learn how to talk to myself? Basically under standing that learning comes from kindess, patience, and practice. So I find myself doing a lot of very kind self talk that is remarkably affective. 

TLDR: Trying not to binge is control for me- its a fighting an urge. It feels like taking something from yourself. Asking myself what I need today so that I won’t resort to binging at the end of the night is letting go, being honest about my vulnerability and that I have needs that are valid, and it’s giving myself something. 

For me self talk has been the single most impactful thing in my recovery this far because it allows me to give self love while nurturing new belief systems that will help me move forward.

Hope my experience gives you some ideas ❤️❤️"
EatingDisorders,fph42tx,t3_gd8ssr,1588614605.0,"Dieticians are the way to go! They rock. 

One bit of advice from my experiences:

I think it good to consider meal prepping (making a weeks worth of meals so you can just grab and go), preparing meals each time, as well as knowing healthy prep-free/no cooking options etc. Especially because a meal plan can trigger the desire to control and also desire to restrict in the sense of denying that sometimes you want something other than what was planned. I know if I feel unable to meet the food expectations I set for myself, I’m more likely to say ‘fuck it’ and default to disordered eating in a moment of heated emotions.

I alternate a lot. There are some weeks where I just don’t want to think about food or deal with it, and having stuff premade in the freezer is awesome. Other weeks, I find that the act of preparing healthy meals for myself by hand each day is incredibly healing and cathartic. 
I also have plans for single meals that don’t require cooking at all for when I don’t have anything premade and I don’t feel like I can handle the pressure of cooking. Or I have meals that are still good for me that accommodate cravings for certain things so I can practice incorporating food I crave in a way that is totally ok for me- even plans for things to eat when I have pms and I know Im going to want to eat emotionally.

Its good to know that you are allowed to be in different places with it emotionally over time. Routine can be extremely important in recovery, but not having a variety of ‘routines’ that work for you denies yourself the benefit of just being human and your needs fluctuating in a normal way. 

I find that considering this keeps me from ditching out on my meal plans when one specific type of meal plan feels impossible or overwhelming one day. It helps keep me from being all or nothing ‘well I was too stressed to meal prep so I fucked this week up’ and then starting to associate the meal prepping with anxiety and feelings of obligation and failure. 

Be kind and give yourself enough variety to meet your emotional needs at various times because its ok to be human! Nothing triggers me more that trying to hold myself up to rigid expectations and trying to ‘will power’ through it without accounting for the fact that I am a *person*.  <333"

My worry is moreso how am I ever going be able to get past this if I can’t let myself feel things. When I feel things, my body does this. Even now in present time, if I let myself feel much emotion (about something that doesn’t have crossover with my trauma) my body reacts this way. I spent so many years pushing my feelings down as far as they could go so my body take the brunt of it now.

I can’t/don’t want to keep living this way forever. I want to learn how to let myself experience emotions and be present with them. But doing this leads to physical reaction/pain/etc. that is debilitating.

So what I am getting at is how am I supposed to get over this hump? I’ve been working on this for 2 1/2 years now with professionals (and my therapist is amazing) Im at a place where denying all emotion is starting to feel unnatural (because of all the work I’ve done) but if I don’t deny it, I’m stuck with pain and other physical repercussions.

How do people get past this? I can’t drive myself to an early grave but I also can’t continue to suppress/shut off emotion like I’ve done my whole life.

I feel like I’m trapped in between two belief systems. My brain is already believing that denying my feelings is wrong and wants to push forward and be heard finally but my body still seems to believe that I’m not safe."

It’s really helping me appreciate how much I want/need to work on my ED issues more when this is all over. I’ve been living like this for well over a decade after getting over the hump where the ‘worst’ of my symptoms were in check.

I basically try self talk where I address myself as patiently and loving as possible (like you would a child) and tell myself ‘no sweetie- it’s not time to eat yet.
