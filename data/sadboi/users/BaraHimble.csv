Quarantining is a preemptive strike to help lessen the number of people infected.  Think of it like staying indoors on a rainy day.

A physician who is a YouTube did a good job at making me feel better.  Hopefully, he'll explain things that'll make you feel better too.

I'm excited too because it is a job that is back in my field, although an entirely new section of it that I don't have much experience in.  I see it as a learning opportunity.

I am trying to not get too excited in case they don't pick me.  It's a little soul crushing to not get picked."

I'll get really excited about a topic, like a video game, television show, or an aspect of my job.  Then I'll start to doubt myself that the person I'm talking to really cares, if I'm boring them, or are they just being nice to me until they can get away.  Once a family member said that they regretted introducing me to a television series because I talked about it a lot, so it's reiterated my lack of self-confidence."
