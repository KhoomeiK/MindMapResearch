birthcontrol,fm66gy6,t3_ft3obi,1585787305.0,"dude ibuprofen will be your best friend. do not do any sort of exercise for at least a week or so as it will definitely cause cramps, and invest in a good heating pad"

birthcontrol,fiy7rfm,t3_f70ji8,1582834189.0,"i had a Mirena inserted this morning, overall the entire experience was pretty uneventful. more uncomfortable than painful tbh. the most pain you'll experience is when they open your cervix and actually insert the implant, and it feels like a period cramp but sharper. as soon as the speculum is removed the sharp pain should subside and you may have some cramps for a little while but overall it shouldnt be awful. the worst part for me is that its making me constipated but that should go away soon."
ptsd,f8r1x1l,t1_f8h8tvs,1574729912.0,"ur name is rly funny too haha :') I'm starting dbt soon and I'm hoping it helps, I've looked into cbt too for the future. i hope your therapy helps you heal bc it's really hard not being able to believe yourself and being unable to cope because of it"
ptsd,f8h839g,t1_f8h7gi6,1574570792.0,this helps a lot <3 it's validating knowing that others have experienced similar things and are starting to be able to accept it. I'm currently working on that part. the initial healing part is over but the acceptance is somehow harder on me
