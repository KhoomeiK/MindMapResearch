I'd second what others have said, you definitely need a shoulder rest. Also, your bow angled the wrong way. You should be twisting it so the hair is angled towards your face and the stick is pointing out. I'd also recommend working on your bow hold. It can be hard to break out of bad habits with things like bow hold later on, so the more you can work on it now, the easier it will be in the long run.

Good luck!"
Makeup,fnbpdy2,t3_g0o748,1586819716.0,"I used to have this problem when I used both primer and setting powder. I have extremely dry skin, and even when it was moisturized, everything got cakey, but I felt like I needed primer and powder so things would look smooth and last. After a lot of trial and error, here's what I found works, at least with my skin:

1. Ditched the primer. I tried so many different ones and tbh I'm not convinced anyone needs it, ever.
2. Apply foundation with fingers, not brushes or sponges, which for me makes it seem to kind of melt into the skin? I also try to apply lightly and sparingly. I have bad acne, but to me the cakey-ness of heavy foundation just accentuates it, and I think it looks better to do very light foundation and then spot conceal.
3. Apply powder only to undereyes.
4. Set with setting spray (I like UD All-Nighter, but there are a lot of good ones!)

For me this makes my skin look dewey and lasts even through 12-hour shifts at the hospital! I've used this technique with a few foundations and it's worked, but my favorite is Pur 4-in-1 Love Your Selfie. Not sure if this technique would work on oily or combo skin, but hope it helps!"

AskReddit,fci40x5,t3_eh7571,1577657514.0,"Worked as a housekeeper at a medium size hotel in college. One day an elderly couple came in. They seemed very nice and normal, stayed one night. When I got there to clean, front desk said the couple seemed really nervous and awkward on check out.

It turned out one of them (we never found out which) was scheduled for a colonoscopy, and had to take some pretty intense laxatives the night before as part of the prep. Apparently they didn't want to just sit on the toilet, but also didn't want to deal with the mess from leaving the toilet, hence staying at a hotel.

So basically what we found is multiple trails of vile-smelling liquid poo from the bed to the bathroom and back. Presumably they kept waking up, walking the bathroom trailing poo, and going back to bed. I don't know if the person had bowel problems already on top of taking laxatives, but it was the most disgusting poo smell I've ever smelled in my life. I've been working in healthcare for 5+ years now since finishing college, still never smelled exactly that smell again.

We had to do the primary clean-up, but after that the room was closed for a professional biohazard cleaning crew. Seriously don't understand why they didn't stay home, or at least just sit on the toilet until everything was done."

I work in healthcare and deal with patients with cirrhosis of the liver from alcohol on a daily basis. It's insanely common, it's extremely uncomfortable to go through, and it's usually fatal. But it's a long, slow, painful way to die.

I think most people think cirrhosis only happens to elderly people who are alcoholics for 30 years. Not true. Most of our patients are middle age at most, and I had a patient who was only in his mid 20s when he died. You don't even have to be a crazy alcoholic; just drinking a little too much on a regular basis will do it. Drinking 3-4 beers a day doesn't give your liver enough time to heal, and even if you aren't drunk from doing it, it does a lot of damage and can lead to cirrhosis over time.

To be clear, I'm not anti alcohol. I drink myself. People just don't take it seriously enough, and don't realize how quickly you can damage your liver."

I usually spend a lot of time gaming, watching movies, reading, etc. Nobody in my household has been woken up (I ask occasionally if I'm being too loud, just in case). I use headphones when watching/playing things with noise, try to be fairly quiet when moving around (making food, bathroom, etc.) and there have been zero issues.

That being said, I use a laptop with a pretty quiet keyboard, but my bf has a Razor mechanical keyboard that's so noisy it's like a machine gun going off while he games. He doesn't play while I sleep so it hasn't been an issue, but I bet it's loud enough to keep me up if he did. It sounds like yours might be similar. Maybe time to look for a quieter keyboard?"
