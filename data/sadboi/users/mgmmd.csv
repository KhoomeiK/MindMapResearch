BPD,fcthgrg,t3_eitxnk,1577943414.0,"Dating apps set people up for failure, yet it is SO hard to find people these days without them. And the rejection is very difficult to deal with. I think trying on and if for a couple months is a good tactic so you donâ€™t have time to get overwhelmed with your success or lack there of.   These days we never have to leave our houses if we donâ€™t want to, which means we arenâ€™t out meeting like-minded people who could be interested us  

Good luck ðŸ˜Š"
BPD,fcrwzfz,t1_fcqiq9h,1577907767.0,"This sounds like more than just favorite person. It actually sounds more obsessive than that. The best way to get over this is to see if she has someone she trusts that the two of you could use as a mediator. If, in the presence of the mediator, you can explain to her in very non-judgemental terms that you donâ€™t have any ill will but this is over. You might be able to get her to understand in a way that doesnâ€™t seem like an attack to her. This sounds like an extremely difficult situation. It is really important that she not feel attacked in any way or she will respond by continuing her obsession"
BPD,fcqi85q,t3_eiigut,1577886440.0,"This is not normal for anybody, but it definitely could be someone with BPD. The problem is that if she is not willing to get help, she may continue this behavior. I am so sorry you are in this position."

If you truly like him and want a long term relationship then heâ€™s going to find out eventually. As long as you explain things and donâ€™t act unpredictably then Iâ€™m sure he will be fine. This diagnosis does not change who you are.  You are worthy of a healthy relationship.
