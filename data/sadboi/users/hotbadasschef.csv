SuicideWatch,fpbuukr,t3_gcb0sp,1588479312.0,"People will always hate others who are brave enough to put themselves out there. It’s like they think that if someone is presenting their soul in their preferred medium, if it isn’t catered to them, why did they do it anyways? It’s a very lowly, entitled, self serving attitude to have. 

It may not fully sink in now, but I want you to know you’re not alone. I’m a creative and I still find myself sharing something I’ve put a lot of time and care into, only to feel mortified by sometimes a single comment, or myself looking for bash-able qualities in my work, to prepare myself for trolls that never show. 

I think part of being a creative soul is being willing to rip your heart out for the benefit of others as well as following your passion. No one is ever universally worshipped and loved in this world; but I think making a difference in even one person’s life is an incredible feat in itself. It’s admirable that you followed your childhood dream to be a writer. I’m sure you’re incredible, and I’d encourage you to not stop while you’re in hell. 

Are there any other careers related to writing you’d be open to looking into? Journalism, short stories?"

legaladvice,fns8hmv,t1_fns7keg,1587215698.0,"Allow me to clarify, I’d like the heat turned back on at the very minimum. We received a rent reduction at the beginning of the semester for having dealt with this issue then. I would like to see this happen again due to the length of the period without heat, how vital it is to living here in an area like this, and honestly, because with quarantine we’ve been here 24/7. It’s not like we are essential workers or our campus is open and we aren’t here for most of the day/have a place to escape to that does have heat. I’m grateful to have a roof over my head and to be safe and healthy but not being able to move freely without being obnoxiously cold is effecting my quality of everyday life. We have one month left on the lease before we move out assuming we can go home (covid) so if this is something I need to let go - it is what it is, but having heat for that last month would make a huge difference. 

Thank you for letting me know about the final payment! I don’t have parents in my life to go to for these things, so I’m not always sure what to do in serious situations like this. I appreciate your advice."

Does it make a difference if rent was already due? I am not held to a month by month lease, it’s semesterly since it’s a student rental. We have separate leases but I have paid over 2/3rds of mine with a remaining balance I agreed with my landlord on paying at a later date (this was over texts, still have them.) it was technically owed in January as a one time payment. 

I realize now I didn’t clarify, I apologize. This is my last year with this landlord, but my first year at this property. I lived at a different house for the first two years and we only had minor issues, never problems with the heat but it didn’t run on oil there. The water has never been turned off, but we get the notices that it will be periodically (this has been all three years.) We forward them to LL, no response, but the water has never gone off so I assume they’ve handled it."
