Your mind convinced you that you’re fine when I’m reality you’re hurting your body. I know it’s hard but you need to take that step and ask for help. Trust me when I say your presence matters and that there is someone out there whose life you’ve impacted. You are capable of more than you realize and I’m sending you my best!!"
EatingDisorders,fj4ybkf,t3_fbhcba,1583019827.0,You are not alone!! I feel myself slipping into disordered habits around my parents bc they just don’t understand what we go through. It seems hard but you need to look out for what the best thing is for you. Only you understand what your body truly needs to be healthy. Continue to push on because you’re worth it!!
