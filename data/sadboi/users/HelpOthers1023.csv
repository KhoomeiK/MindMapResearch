After you’ve read reviews on the topic you’re interested in you can either look into the references for research articles that will go into more depth on parts you want to know more about or do another search to find recent research articles on the topic.

neuro,fpv0h0h,t1_fpuzdac,1588930382.0,"Sorry, I thought you were applying to a PhD. Go to the school you like the most. Find a lab that you like to volunteer in as an undergraduate. You can stay in that lab the whole four years or switch between labs if they study something different. I did three years of undergraduate research. I started studying alcohol tolerance and epigenetics in fruit flies for a year and then learned to use the transmission electron microscope on fruit fly brains for a year. After that I spent my senior year working on alcohol again. Specifically the transgenerational epigenetics of alcohol in c. elegans. 

After I graduated, I did a Postbaccalaureate program with the national institutes of health (NIH) on the chronic effects of alcohol withdrawal in the extended amygdala of rats.

Now I’m getting my PhD in the NIH-Johns Hopkins graduate partnership program where I am studying the genetics of alcoholism and emotional disorders in humans, rodents, and stem cell culture. 

I started studying alcohol in fruit flies, moved up to worms, then rodents, and now I’m integrating all that I’ve learned to apply it to humans as well as continuing what I’ve learned in other model systems. 

If you are asking these questions now you are off to a great start. I wish you the best of luck."

You could of course end up in that lab but you might not want to join or they may not find a spot.
