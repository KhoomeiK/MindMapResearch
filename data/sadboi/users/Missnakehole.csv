todayilearned,fj7eqmj,t1_fj6rg87,1583090612.0,"I know it doesn't matter much at this point, but it's annoying to see a chill comment asking for some reflection like yours was, to get turned into something about demeaning the mentally ill. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for years, and some more specific disorders as well and sometimes reminding myself that at least I'm lucky to have a warm apartment, clean water, pets, and to have been born in a stable peaceful country. I still have days where I can't see past my own pain, I think that's pretty human. But I absolutely think that at times, checking your perspective is healthy and a good coping skill. Asking yourself if something is really as bad as it seems, or maybe it's just my brain telling me lies again. So... Basically, as someone with mental illness, I'm sorry your comment got misconstrued. I think those people are probably having really dad days today, because that's the sorta stuff I might say if I got triggered. Hopefully really soon, we'll all be able to afford proper treatment and fix our shit. Chin up!"
UberEATS,fhu7n4b,t1_fhtxawd,1581882924.0,That almost happened to me. Thankfully the customer was one of the good ones and texted me ahead of time and warned me if I took a certain route I'd end up at toll ferry and who knows how long it would take to get across. I love when the customer is empathic and gives you helpful tips for reaching them safely and efficiently. I always want my food as soon as possible so giving good directions is for me more than them. That's what I really never understand.
BPD,fhjgtxs,t1_fhj3a1h,1581645859.0,"Hey man no one reacts the appropriate way every time. Don't beat yourself up. You're trying babe. It sounds like that was really rough time. I'm glad you made it home safe that night too! I know this is super obnoxious to hear probably, but don't drive when you're fucked up. It's not even about your own like at that point. You can irrevocably damage someone else's life and that's just never okay for anyone to do (if you didn't drive ignore this).

Okay but I really do think your friend cares about you. Both you and her probably didn't handle the situation perfectly. I think it's often easy to expect that because we know a lot crisis planning and SI and all the mental health stuff, others will too when most people don't know about this stuff. My boyfriend is pretty normal and ""neurotyptical"" and he just really cannot understand some of my experiences. Helping someone through that can be a lot. Can you explain a little more about the SI comment situation. Did she ask you not to tell her that sorta stuff or was it something else. I don't think I'm understanding that fully. 

I think a lot of the time it isn't really about weather your feelings are justified or not, it's how you handle them.

""youâ€™re probably right about the wedding planning and giving me space. idk if that changes all the shitty things that happened beforehand""

I really think it's up to you to decide what you wanna do with the relationship. Even if she did fuck up, is this something she does a lot? Can you talk it out. Let it go. There's no right answer, you know? And remember this is just my perspective, I could be way off base. 

Replying here is totally fine unless you'd rather talk privately through DMs. If you don't know how I'll send you a message."
BPD,fhj2h67,t1_fhj1omn,1581636852.0,"Fucking amen. I know I need to try harder but I'm always just like what's the fucking point. I don't matter and I always fuck it up anyways. But then of course if I did actually try, I would probably do better but just can't seem to get there. I'm tired of spending so much energy just getting through the day. I recently was told I may also have ADD. So one thing that's currently helping is the medicine for that, I have more motivation. But I've been so edgy and defensive with my partner lately too."
BPD,fhj1zye,t3_f3i1l1,1581636555.0,"Your post keeps linking me to r/ADHD and it seems like a reply to something there so I'm sorry if this post is totally annoying. But anyways. It sounded like we might be having similar but reversed experiences. I've gone from thinking I was just depressed\ anxious and then got on meds and they had me down as bipolar nos. Then if seemed more like borderline and I had some therapists who agreed with me. And then my current psychiatrist told me I could have adult ADD and I was googling stuff and that seems to be a common experience. Also seems like they are comorbid? So I've been in a lot of turmoil trying to figure out if I'm one or the other or both or something else.

If you don't mind sharing, which of your symptoms have you been questioning? Like what's making you think it's borderline not an attention issue. Like for me, I never would have ever considered ADD as a possibility for myself but after doing some reading a bit online, I realized I really didn't understand what ADD actually looks like and I also discovered rejection sensitive dysphoria and it sounded exactly like me. But rejection sensitivity seems to also be a factor in BPD. It's very confusing... just curious about your experience\ history."
BPD,fhj09ug,t3_f3ibmj,1581635489.0,"Okay your first paragraph resonates with me a lot. Especially just watching myself act in completely inappropriate ways and feeling totally out of control of what's happening to me. And then trying to get the forgiveness I probably don't deserve, asking again and again for understanding that it's not something I want to be doing and that I'm so sick of my self the hatred burns. And feeling hopeless as I cause more and more damage which erodes the relationship more and more and triggers me more and the cycle spirals. I know my partner loves me, but he's just really lost patience and I don't really blame his most of the time. He has a point that yes I truly am suffering, but at some point I either need to change how I behave and react because he deserves peace, or maybe we can't be together. But then my fear of abandonment kicks in and I pull away or want to shut down which isn't helpful... It fucking sucks. Every single other person gets to take a break from me when they want to, but I'm stuck in this clusterfuck 24\7. Sleep, getting off, or drugs is pretty much as far away as I can get from myself. I constantly avoid being alone with my thoughts. I want out too."
BPD,fhix862,t3_f3hab4,1581633655.0,"Hey! Okay so first off, you definitely can have that beautiful idea as a reality. Having a loving partner, a couple pets, good place to live and stability sounds amazing. Your disorder doesn't get to dictate your life because seriously fuck BPD. You deserve better than that. You sound like you have a lot of self awareness and are taking early steps to get a handle on your health. I don't think you're giving yourself enough kudos for how smart you're already being. Take a sec and thank yourself. 

You're definitely not alone is having your first seriously relationship end poorly. Except for my current partner, all my past relationships were terrible and they were all pretty manipulate in one way or another. I'm my current one is still sorta dysfunctional lol.Unless hearing more about my experience would be helpful, I'm not gonna start making this about me lol. 

So anyways, ok how to to live your life, if your single then enjoy your time to yourself. I'm still working on figuring out what coping skills work for me. Do you have any interests or hobbies or goals for your self. Having something to focus your energy and attention on can help you get out of your head. Some little things I do when I'm upset are making sure I'm a comfortable temperature, taking a shower, stretching or yoga, listening to asmr videos. If you're ever getting to like a crisis point, making a bowl or sink full of ice water and dunking your face can really bring you back down. Sounds weird but it works. Has to do with triggering a drowning response. Sorry this is so long. Omg! Hope some of this is useful.

Edit: For some context. I'm a women in my late 20s. More of a quiet borderline and recently diagnosed as possibly also having ADD."
BPD,fhiufvq,t3_f3hk8a,1581632054.0,"Hey there! I hate feeling ignored and like I'm not important to others. It triggers me so hard and then I get all upset and sad which ends up me getting pissed and having this tunnel vision about how terrible they are. I feel like you might be in that same boat. That's probably splitting right? Anyways not the point.

You mentioned she's planning her wedding, so maybe from her point of view, she's been trying to be supportive and it might have been frustrating being pushed away. So she decided to give you some space and maybe she focused on her self for a little while. I bet she's busy. But it doesn't sound like she's stopped caring for you. I know how easy it is to panic when you think you're losing someone you love. Feeling like you're being abandoned and how much it's hurts and how fucking angry it gets me. 

I might be totally wrong here, and she's actually a bad friend. I think it would be worth it to talk with her about how you've been feeling when you're ready to talk nicely (when I'm pissed I tend to get the urge to be mean so it's not a good idea for me to try to have those types of conversations until I've gotten more regulated again).

I guess what I'm trying to say, probably poorly, is don't lash out until you've got all the facts. DM me if you wanna vent or talk it out more. Chin up buttercup."

And no adults in my childhood seemed concerned about me, I didn't get into trouble and had good grades. I did well in college and grad school. And there were a bunch of things about me that I either thought everyone experienced or they were just proof that I wasn't enough.

But now, the older I get, the more like seems more and more out of control. I feel like I'm swimming in this sea of confusion that other people glide through with ease.

I agree. It's one of those things I always wanna learn or prep for but it's just never a priority with other stuff going on. But I would definitely love to know some basics. Starting a fire without a man-made spark. Basic use and operation of a gun. Knowing wild stuff that's safe to eat. That sorta thing.

BorderlinePDisorder,fgi7xyr,t1_fgi505y,1580810320.0,"Ya I know what you mean. And some of stuff is a bit helpful, like the parts where you learn about how your brain works.

Most of those things are helpful when your ""sad"". But for the those times you've been sobbing on your bathroom floor at 3am for the last two hours and the pain in your chest hurts so bad I think I'm dying... Ya not of the things on that list aren't super useful. I would also like to opportunity to be in some groups thou. There's gotta be a couple things that are helpful lol.

Okay but one weird thing that strangely helps a lot? When you're completely over loaded, like totally losing it. If you can, get a large bowl or sink or container and fill it with water and dump some ice in. Then dunk your face. Try to stay like that for a couple seconds. It triggers the drowning response which signals your body to calm the fuck down to conserve oxygen. It's also very shocking, sorta stops you in your tracks for a few seconds but you can also feel some of the tension really start to drain away. Keep dunking a lot as you'd like lol. I can only do a quick one the first time and then as I calm down I can hold my face in the water for a few seconds longer. I thought my therapist was nuts. But it works (if you already know about this, my bad. Maybe another user might find it helpful)."
BorderlinePDisorder,fghemru,t1_fggq4xk,1580783128.0,"Hey. I'm so so happy you can relate and think this might help.

And Jesus, is it exhausting. Everyone else can at least get a break from me. I'm stuck in here forever.

Everyone else has had such insightful comments so I thought I'd share what helps me once I've decided I want to share something or open up. When I talk it can be harder, especially in times of stess\ depression, whatever, to translate my thoughts into words. My other problem is I struggle with a LOT of shame so sometimes it's like I physically cannot make the words come out. So I write stuff down. This lets me organize what I want to say, re read and make changes if I think something could be clarified better, I can make sure I'm not being really defensive or mean. I also think it's easier to process for myself what was going on later, once I've gotten back closer to baseline. You could use texts, handwritten letter, email. Maybe talk to him before, like hey I want to tell you some stuff but it's to hard to say, I'd like to write you a letter.

At first it sorta irritated my boyfriend. He'd be like don't text me from the house, come talk to me. But he's been more supportive of it lately.

The synopsis is a little off. The protagonist, Titus, does have the feed installed and it's not quite like the tracking chips we put in dogs. It is like, you said, just like being wired into the internet constantly thou. Titus's love interest had her feed installed when she was older and in the first part of the book the kids are involved in a hack and something bad happens to her feed. That's sorta the general set up. I don't wanna say anymore since I prefer to enjoy a story without knowing too much about it before had. Please please please read it! It's a YA book, not very long and easy to get through."

BPD,ff82grh,t3_es4b8r,1579664240.0,I definitely do this. I didn't even really realize it was weird and\or a problem until my boyfriend said I need to stop acting like there are people always watching. No one is watching. Stop being so embarrassed. Which I don't really know how to do. I just talk to myself about stuff I'm doing and I'll get embarrassed for messing up when I'm alone.
BPD,fekv8iu,t3_epmzo7,1579208297.0,"Not in exactly the same way, but yes. Like if I'm talking and someone doesn't respond or I don't hear back from a email or text. Just not feeling heard is so upsetting to me. I get super angry, like The Rage. I think it has to do with feeling invalidated, invisible, and rejected."

I hate when I get stuck in a cycle of that. You just get so tired."
BPD,fcwvuxp,t3_ejandy,1578039778.0,"Yes! Very relatable. It just makes things more confusing. During the episode, I'm so sure that I'm completely right... But then when I'm more regulated, I can start to actually see how it all looked from the outside and it's so fucking awful. 

Do you find that after the initial episode, you then have to get through a second one caused by the exhaustion and shame from the first?"

UberEATS,fct9373,t1_fct5gdl,1577936165.0,"I read your other comment about them sitting somewhere for 30 mins. That does sound like bullshit for sure! Honestly I would probably have texted them to see what was up and then looked into a refund if they literally sat somewhere for 30 mins. The fuck?

But no, it's not like we have our supervisors call and ask what happened and get our side/chide us. Basically, you can give a thumbs up or down, tip or don't tip. That's the only thing I can really ""see"" directly as a driver from you. I've gotten notices a few times saying there were reports of missing food or tampered bags... Which usually makes me think of the times in the past few weeks where the restaurant fucked up or something happened to packaging (a bag was so greasy once the bottom feel out handing it to some one, I caught it thou lol). Unfortunately, the system is pretty broken and it's the drivers and the customers who seems to get fucked over the most. 

Not that you really asked for any of this lol"

UberEATS,fcs1zse,t1_fcrzlet,1577910220.0,"Ya so then looking at the app or Ubers website would have been a really good first step. Like looking up their refund policy.

Why would there be a sub Reddit for Uber eats users? What would even be the point of that?"

Also you know this is a sub for drivers? We don't work for corporate or know shit about how Uber manages things. I never really understand these questions. Like did you Google it first? 

""How do get refund for late Uber order""

UberEATS,fcrtdf0,t3_eilazp,1577906357.0,"Like does support call us to tell us you complained about us? No, they don't.

And honestly, unless something egregious happened, try not to get the driver involved. The best way to show a driver they didn't do a good job is to not tip."

Your message was really nice."
BPD,fcmilr3,t1_fcmhtku,1577776752.0,"""it"" as in BPD or empathy? I've mostly managed to deal with school and work just fine. School was generally pretty easy for me. Work has gotten harder, the older you get, the more is expected of you. I'm not working a proper job right now. Things have just been feeling really hard. Been slowly falling apart for the last couple years. My newest doctor thinks I have ADHD. I started Adderall. 

I'm actually really empathetic and have education\career in mental health. I mostly struggle with it in the context of romantic relationships. With others less significant to me, I'm much more stable because they mean less. Distress in my romantic relationships really fucks me up and I act really foolishly. When I'm in a good head space, I'm a great partner because I'm thoughtful and like to take care of people I love. But when I'm upset I lose sight of everything but my pain and cause a lot of damage. I write this, laying in bed when I should be out working... Probably wayyy more than you were asking for. Did I even answer your question? Haha"
