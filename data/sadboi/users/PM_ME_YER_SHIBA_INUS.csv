But if the numbers add up, so you can move onto ""why""...even if there is a hormonal imbalance, appetite is only a factor. People with weight-loss-resistant hormonal conditions like PCOS can still lose weight if they stick with garden-variety methods, just not as quickly as without. Especially if they're able to redirect their appetite onto low-kCal, high-volume food, instead of just making it a battle of ""eat"" versus ""don't eat"".

Some ""thinner people"" are just fatter people who readjusted their routine and stuck with it.

But still - appetite is an underrated factor, and it's multifaceted. People who say ""just eat less"" are myopic and oversimplifying at best. Hormones matter, sleep schedule matters, exercise matters, food composition/satiation matters, and the list keeps on going.

Even how big your stomach is. Stomachs grow/shrink based on typical intake. Somebody who's used to eating large amounts is going to feel the absence especially strongly. Hell, that's part of the basis for banding surgery that staples the stomach.

Anybody whose intake doesn't even logically mesh with their weight when accurately tracked should see a doctor ASAP. Including being strangely thin."

It might be worth some time soul-searching about what you do want to be seen as, and what bothers you about your body. What would be better on a day-to-day basis if you didn't have feminine attributes? What do you wish you had instead?

I think it pays to remember that many of those people are bitter or ashamed at what they've done and are projecting their own experiences onto all trans people, and others are probably just terfs who are not trans and have never transitioned.

Nuclear truth. First part makes me sad too, bc I get it. If being happily transitioned is an unattainable dream, they never lost their shot at it. They can decide they're not missing out on anything.

Or they need to blame Trans Ideology for ""making"" them make that individual choice down the wrong path, because if they couldn't, there'd be nobody to blame but themselves. It was the doctors. It was the internet. Their child's friends. Scapegoat antagonists come in all shapes and sizes.

It's cute that all the TERFs probably think they're being stealthy and nobody can tell.

> The only thing I identify with is AGP. I get very envious of womens' bodies. But I think that's not my main reason for wanting to transition and it's an understandable side effect of being trans.

Even if/though she's cis, it easily reads like something I could've ended up writing as a freaked out egg, if I had gotten into a TERF community.

And if I didn't stick with my assignment, the sky would fall, and dogs would start walking on their hind legs, or whatever.
