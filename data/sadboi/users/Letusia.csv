water,fqzfi00,t1_fqv59ba,1589766283.0,"I saw the reviews in Amazon and people tested the water like fluoride and chlorine and there was not much difference. I don’t seem to trust this because why would the tds go up that much. Also, Aquagear certification seems questionable since I’ve looked at reviews of people talking about Aquagear."
water,fqrye95,t1_fq89kkl,1589594546.0,"Even when I taste tested a 15 tds water, it taste sour and acidic that it might hurt my tongue lol. So whenever it starts going up like after 6 tds, I would change the filter. It seems you might have to change more often than I am because your tap water is 552 and my tap water is 230. :( My filter stops working around 15 gallons so yours could be around 10 gallons maybe."
asexuality,fpuou9m,t1_fptccr2,1588918892.0,Thanks for the good info! I’ll try to learn more about them. :)

I’m thinking of buying a water distiller in the future to save costs lol."
obeyme,fpfcdu6,t1_fpepp2c,1588567211.0,I guess he does remind you to take care of yourself which is nice of him. Thank you for sharing your thoughts about Asmo!✨❤️

obeyme,fpevc5a,t1_fpdt4tw,1588555736.0,I don’t remember the part when MC returns.🤔 He does seem kind of lonely so that’s maybe why he wants a lot of attention and maybe show that he’s the most beautiful by getting love by others. Thank you for replying about Asmo!✨❤️
obeyme,fpeurn8,t1_fpdcypr,1588555375.0,I can see him trying his hardest to be the most beautiful which I respect that part of him since it takes a lot of effort to be beautiful. He does seem to be too cheerful so maybe he is hiding some of his emotions. Thank you for sharing this eye opening part about Asmo!
obeyme,fpeubsz,t1_fpcx8vb,1588555105.0,Yes beautiful people can be good marketing lol. Thanks for sharing your perspective about Asmo!

water,foxlg1t,t1_fox53l8,1588147741.0,I just don’t trust my tap water because it might have harmful minerals like lead etc so that’s why I’m using the filter. :(
obeyme,foep5xe,t1_ff86abz,1587710140.0,Asmo grosses me out too like when he talked about an orgy party. I try to avoid him as much as possible lol. I feel like you’re just a pawn that could be thrown out anytime if you actually like Asmo lol.
obeyme,fnv62lo,t3_ezpicx,1587281504.0,"1. Levi : He is cute and hot at the same time. He’s an otaku like me lol. I love his purple/blue hair and his tsundere personality is cute. <3

2 Belphie: He is kind of the second version of Levi lol. I kind of like his clingy side too.

3 Beel: He is a cutie pie. So cute and innocent. Plus, I like his muscles lol.

4 Satan: He is sophisticated with all those books. He is the most normal out of all the brothers lol.

5 Lucifer: He’s alright. I like his dominant personality which I like and dislike at the same time lol.

6 Mammon: He’s too into money which is a turn off lol. 

7 Asmodeus: Worst type of guy because he a f boy. He grosses me out especially when he talked about an orgy party lol."

runefactory,fngalih,t1_fng9u75,1586926573.0,Yeah I think I’ll try giving it turnip seeds lol. Thank you for all the helpful advice! <3 I guess patience is key in Rune Prana.
runefactory,fng946f,t1_fng7zkv,1586925427.0,I see and whaat lvl 12550! (OoO) You are the master of patience. So giving turnip seeds work too? (OoO)
runefactory,fng6r8l,t1_fng590m,1586923688.0,Yep patience lol but I’ll try leveling up to make it easier for me to catch it.
runefactory,fng6jm3,t1_fng2hua,1586923539.0,"No sorry, I kind of came back playing this game again so it’s been a long time. I’m thinking of capturing the ant queen too in Rune Prana but it might be the same problem as the heaven’s scissors so I’m just gonna keep on leveling up as my strategy first lol."
runefactory,fng6ash,t1_fnfzxyq,1586923366.0,"Bubble? You mean like when I brush the monster? I kept brushing it until there’s no more bubble of the monster and it still didn’t like me lol. I think the bubble appears on other monsters too when I brush them. Also, If bubble means when I give it items like honey, I almost caught it but that skull shows every time. :( I guess it might be harder to capture at a lower lvl than the monster so I’ll just try to level up. :)"
runefactory,fnfoycb,t1_fnfm1hc,1586912438.0,"Maybe because I’m a lower level than the scorpion? Well, I guess I’ll try to level up first and see if I can get that scorpion lol."
runefactory,fnfo9la,t1_fnfm1hc,1586912043.0,It’s not full. There is one more empty spot for a monster because one room only has 3 monsters. I probably just have bad luck or something lol.

Advice,fiz5y3g,t1_fiyxrkg,1582854922.0,Thank you for the advice! Yeah I think he knows that there’s better pay out there. He just needed to be more persuaded to do it because he likes to be his own boss which makes him kind of stubborn.
SuicideWatch,fifmurv,t1_fifk20w,1582391320.0,"Sorry if it sounds insensitive. I’m suicidal too but if I get a kid, it would be my responsibility and my fault so I have to live for that until it grows to an adult at least. That kid did not ask to be born and just be left like that."
SuicideWatch,fgr4vbz,t1_fgj6m8m,1581038205.0,You should try to live for your son because he’s your responsibility now. It’s kind of terrible to just leave your son like that.. You shouldn’t have gotten a kid if you were that depressed.. so at least live until he’s grown up..
selfimprovement,ffh21m2,t1_ffgttku,1579920999.0,"Thank you for your reply and I live in the U.S. The bad thing about the cpa is that I need 150 credits to get the cpa and my bachelor’s degree Accounting only has 120 credits and I have 123 credits. I’m thinking of going back to college with a first time loan with government help. I might do some computer science classes and I might at least get 150 credits or more if I try to get a bachelor’s for computer science. If I feel like computer science isn’t for me (hopefully I like it), I might get my cpa maybe when I hit 150 credits. Idk this is my idea so that’s why I need some suggestions from other people if this is an ok idea. :( I am lucky that I have a supportive sister who is graduating with bachelor’s degree in computer science this spring year and she already got interviewed by one of the big companies and other companies too. She’s a genius and my twin sister which I sometimes wonder if we are actually identical twins. I’m just book smart and shy while she’s the outgoing and adventurous type."
Advice,fcppt1j,t1_fcjncxu,1577869521.0,Thank you and I guess I have to use the word helped lol. I’ll try to be brave but I feel like some of my actions with him are kind of clear that I don’t like him. I’m just a coward with words lol and my sister would probably not like me if I say it to him.

MonsterHunter,eue53fr,t3_bnusy2,1563735549.0,I tried arch Nergigante yesterday and it is definitely difficult in multiplayer because you won't know if your teammates are good or bad lol. I played it with my 2 friends and a random guy. We're lucky the random guy is good. We managed to beat it around 30 minutes and I was panicking at the last stage lol. I learned you need health boost 3 and get a voucher to try to get moxie or insurance or both. 1 earplug jewel saves me whenever he tries to roar and dive bomb because I can react quickly. Bring attack boost items like might pill etc. Me and my 1 friend are support wide range which we spam if someone is half life or close to death. We had 2 carts left at last stage but I was still panicking because you'll never know lol. It's definitely rewarding when you beat it but frustrating if you don't beat it..
