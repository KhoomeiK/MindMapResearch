The outside paint was unfinished and he painted all over the windows, there are dents in the house from him hitting the house with a tractor because he did not want to weed-eat, the vents were covered with duct tape yet he was an HVAC business owner. He also ran the system through the house and it is so ugly. There was an unfinished chicken house, junk that sat for years like a giant pile of A/C systems. It is disgusting. Yet, he would spend 2 hours in the mirror while his family is in the car waiting to leave. The sink pipe ran straight down, ruining the foundation, the wood floor is unfinished in the bathroom, etc. I have fixed so much and spent several hours fixing his laziness, including loading the mountain of scrap."

BPD,fmq8ryc,t3_fwsmny,1586295010.0,"I had jobs where I had great pay but could not stand them. My favorite jobs have been working as a hostess, being a stocker (organization makes the 8 hours fly by), and a delivery driver (current). I love my current job. I listen to documentaries and make good money half the week. 

I made a lot at JB Hunt in the office but could not stand the job. I lasted 2 days. I worked as a computer tester for a few months but could no longer physically function. They wanted us to work 12 hour shifts and work faster. I can only do so much without cocaine! Lol!

I need a job where I have some socialization but also alone time. I need to always have something to do. I need a sense of freedom.

I am in college to be an art teacher. My dream job would be a zookeeper. I married into to big of a family for that salary though. 

I had a job working in the women's department putting up racks, rearranging the area, being the fitting room attendant, and that was a lot of fun. I was trusted to run the area so it was freedom. Of course the vodka in the water bottle and my then girlfriend working there helped with the fun. I do not know if I would like that now.

Being a hostess was fun. Restaurant atmospheres are great. The people are typically great (maybe not the managers). I stay busy there too. 

It is hard to stick to a job. I also have a habit of falling in love with jobs and one day I cannot take it anymore and need something new. I have not stayed a full year anywhere, I typically last 6-10 months. I am hoping to be delivering for a year for my resume. My vehicle is an SUV and cannot keep this up.

I hope to one day work at home. I love to write stories, music, create art, etc. My wife and I want to co-write. We can start our plans during isolation!"

I am 26 as well. I went to college when I graduated highschool and could not choose a degree and left after 2 years. I am back in college again. My second semester of return. I never made a friend in college. I had in class friends but they were 40-60 years old. Young college students are difficult to find maturity in.

As a child, I could not keep friends because I did not stay around immoral kids. My mom thought I was the problem and bought me books on how to be friends.

I have given up on friends really. My best friend of over a decade had even failed me and stole 2 grand from me.

Now, I stick to online friends. I found a group with my interest and we are pretty close and dull of love. Maybe that can work for you until you find someone at the college. I also rely on animals. I have enjoyed the company of animals more than humans my entire love as well...

I am sorry you are at home without a loving partner. Can you talk to him about how you feel? Surely he knows it is human to get upset at such things? It is not normal to be happy all day no matter what happens.

Perhaps show him articles or posts of those suffering with sensory issues. Maybe things can improve if he is open to listening. Even though he sounds unpleasant right now remember when he explains his side of why he is moody, listen amd so not deny. You cannot change what someone thinks. You can only try to understand each other in the moment and try to improve for the future. It is no longer about right amd wrong no matter how right you may be...

She seems to get so angry when I am sad due to BPD but yet when I am upset not related to the symptoms she is so sweet and caring. It is so damn weird.

I love my wife more than anything. I know she is an innocent sweet woman. She was damaged by her ex husband. She has been abused by him via the kids for over 2 years now. That alone would harm someone but she put up with NPD abuse hardcore for a time... She also has Aspergers. She has a well above average intelligence and is used to never being wrong. The damage she endured and the mindset of always being right is taking a toll. I see that.

That you for your words and advice. I have made a lot of progress in my symptoms. I did not even have BPD symptoms to this degree until I was with my wife. Many women before her completely abandoned me. They were abusive during our serious relationships and then would vanish. My wife gets that damage ans I feel terrible.

I could not hear her and now she is beyond mad and said she will leave me. She left the room to sleep when I tried asking her what she said again...   She left when I told her I could not sleep either since she threatened to leave...

What the actual fuck????

I sleep on the bathroom floor while she sleeps soundly on the bed? I feel like she has problems from her previous abusive marriage but how do I address that without being seen as the bad guy?

I only ever want to help my Lady Love, but I manage to always fo the perfect thing to upset her.

Is it in my head? Do pepple normally get this upset when they are sleepy? I did not mean to not hear what she asked! I dedicate my moments to her every night. I believe in not going to bed angry. We never know what day might be out last.

I vomited in stress. I cannot ever shop for the family of 5 I have accepted... She hit me when I went out to tell her to not sleep on the couch due to her bad back... I am sure her kids heard it.

Then, take the daily steps mentioned. Find moral people with integrity to be around to keep you on track.

You have to truly want to change. You have to know you can and accept you have to take action. No event person or thing will come along and instantly heal you. It will be a hard road but make your path something you can be proud of.

Choose edifying conversation, educational shows, happy music, etc.

Perhaps listen to Alan Watts, Abraham Hicks, or anyone related. They Will make you think. Maybe start listening to RALPH SMART and move on to Alan Watts after.

Do not keep these things a secret. Get help. The sooner you can learn about yourself and develop improved coping skills, the sooner you can be in abetter mental state.

BPD,fimbu6l,t3_f8kuwz,1582524334.0,"That sounds like the last thing a person with BPD to take part in. Honestly, I got in a relationship with a woman who was married. It was not true poly, her husband was abusive but that is a different story.

Well, that time was torture. It sounded okay but was harder the more time went on. I got lucky she got away from thaf man and we became monogamous. 

It was rough. I worried about a lot and became jealous. I did not feel safe in the relationship, like I could trust it was in stone. 

I have the highest sex drive to hear of. My libido is higher than any man I have known such about. My wife says she thought her ex had a high sex drive but it was nothing compared to mine. I am able still be with only her. If we listen to each other, always explore and have fun, there is no reason for anyone else. 

If it is for any other reason, I would reconsider possibly the relationship in general."
BPD,fimbc0r,t3_f8kymz,1582523846.0,"My advice would be to have that person seek help and therapy as well. I think you should try to live with a family member rather than living with this person. Living with anyone gets stressful at times, partners or friends. It is hard with a partner though. It is more intense. Wait to live together until you both are stable."
BPD,fimb4fu,t3_f8l0rb,1582523649.0,"All I have learned to do is let yourself feel those feelings. Have someone else close to you available in case it gets to be too much for you to keep yourself safe alone.

I have gone through breakups where I was absolutely insane. I would wake up each morning in full panic attack mode and cry for 2 hours. Cannabis got me through it. 

It passes though. Time really does allow us to heal. Take it one day at a time. Stay busy. Socialize with others. Stay physical.

It Will get better."

BDSMAdvice,fcrj6z5,t1_fcr5crg,1577902519.0,He would not have real time from a gps. He has cameras or used the gps to follow you. It sounds like the latter. I would have you vehicle searched for such a thing before you speak to him to know what is really going on. Even with the tracker on your phone along with following you is possessive to a scary level. Be careful how you handle the conversation. This is a huge red flag.

veganrecipes,fcrfx37,t3_eikkfr,1577901298.0,"I really enjoy a lot of bean meals. I like to have refried beans and mix in black beans with chiles and green sauce, onion, cumin, garlic, basic spices, and, paprika and cayenne. I put that into a big bell pepper and bake. It is fairly quick with minimal prep especially with canned and frozen veggies.

Lentils take time to boil but it is an easy process to make tacos with them.

Veggie broth mixed with rice takes time but is again easy. You can cook this to last a few days to and only tastes better as it sits. I like mine with rosemary, lemon, salt, and pepper.

Avocados mixed with seasoning, onions, peppers, whatever added veggies with salsa! I add an egg as well. I do not see a problem with eating eggs. They sit to rot and go to waste.

Gardein (spelling?) Is a great brand. It is meatless meat and there are good chicken options like mandarin ""chicken"". Amy's has great enchiladas. 

I enjoy jalapenos and onions cooked on a skillet alone and eat a big bowl. I often have organic peppers in a jar in the winter. Frozen chopped onion can be bought as well but cutting those do not take long.

Herb pasta is tasty with purple basil.

Now I am hungry!"
RATS,fccl443,t3_eh28ii,1577599650.0,Yes he will. Luckily in flower form it is not as intense because it is fat soluble. Keep an eye on him ams give him some non-fatty foods. It will help.

The aggravated RLS is awful but I am learning how much power I am allowing my psyche to have. I fear my psychological addiction is more severe than I had thought.

I have cut my doses my a third and am doing better. I will continue to do so and time the doses later in the day to help at night.

BPD,fanwmc1,t1_fag5h6o,1576252278.0,"Well, I suppose it goes with saying that are my simple thoughts on the matter as someone associated with such multiple times.

Out of curiosity, to you, what is it that he is missing to be a narcissist? He seems to definitely due the classic lack of real love, he has masks for different people, is a pathological liar, refuses responsibility for his actions and then actually projects himself onto others. He isolates people from their friends and family and makes them dependant on him, etc.

I do mean this response as a way to have healthy opinions and ideas shared! 

I understand I do not know the guy and am having a general idea of him shaped in my head as we do as humans in this time. It is done as observation and not as a negative judgement but a safe one.

Whatever he is, he needs help."
BPD,fanw0es,t1_fan9e39,1576251883.0,"It was helpful. I am doing much better today. It is so difficult to be level headed in the moment. I think it has just happened so many times it gets more emotional for myself each time.

I think I will do research into communication to find out how to better have these kind of conversations that I mean as simple and have no room for interpreting as I mean something negative about her.

I really need to. I love her dearly and want to be how we used to. We used to be able to talk about anything and it would not be considered a hint toward an underlying message. I think I have become guilty of it myself (of interpreting simplicity into something complex).

I would hate to have to not be with this love of mine but I consider it, mostly thinking she deserves someone who is compatible communication wise. I think that about myself too... But then other times I think I m the one with the problem because it seems people get offended by my comments a lot.

I have worked hard toward simple communication. Now, it is like it was the worst adjustment I have made.

Again, thank you for your insight."

littlespace,f9sy72o,t3_e6lta1,1575603490.0,"I think it makes much more sense to be involved with a kink older. Those who are in their teens i feel are too young to be involved in the actual relationship due to the sensitive aspects. It takes a lot of wisdom, experience, and a mature side. 

I am 25 and did not get too involved in the relationship dynamic until I was 24 although I never stopped my quirk s that made me, me. I knew I needed education and to pace.

So, age is so issue and can be a plus. You will find someone. That is the good thing about those who are older, they also have more of an idea of what they want in life and do not want to waste time.

kratom,f8cwaip,t3_e03ij5,1574471164.0,"I had a horrible constipation issue while taking Kratom. I was so addicted to it and was so busy I could not simply quit cold turkey but I eventually cut down my doses after a period of denial. I was taking 2 tablespoons a day- twice as much as I normally would and everyday. I was drinking the powder in a cocoa smoothie.

I typically take it in capsules but have felt so terrible that I did not want to make the capsules nor wait the extra hour to feel the full effects (can you say pathetic?). I noticed that drinking the powder causes much more of a digestion issue! My constipation became so bad I had to have my wife assist me with the use of an enema. I have never felt uncomfortable around her until this time in my life. I cried on the commode experiencing significant pain, embarrassment, and revelation. 

So, I learned to go back to my normal routine the hard way. I am in current withdrawal and it has been hard but my supplements help. I never had this problem when I was taking only 6.5 grams once a day, using Cats Claw as a way to increase potency. I would take it every other day. Of course, do not forget the amount of water a human needs. Thankfully, I eat a healthful diet full of the different fibers and full of hydrating fruits and vegetables. Who knows what would have happened if I had been taking part of the common American diet.

Be careful and exercise control. Eat well and keep active!

When experiencing this constipation do not go for the Milk of Magnesia. It is a joke and will only send watery waster through the small openings, around the hardened stool. They only thing that helped me was taking two scoops of Miralax a day and in the mean time having to use olive oil to lubricate myself and using my finger as a tool to dig out the tip to get the stool moving.... I will never be indulging in that much Kratom again. I hope someone sees how terrible it can be and reduces their dosage!

This actually lasted for a 4 months as I was thinking it was the Keto diet at first but when I switched back it stayed the same. I then realized my error and cut down the Kratom and switched to capsules. I am finally regular again as of only a couple days ago. My advice would quit cold turkey and have supplements to aid you through withdrawal so your body can go back to normal.

I would avoid putting a supplement in your daily routine so you can continue the dosing. Your body is telling you to back off, not to force a way to make it work. Taking medicine that is a laxative everyday is not good for the body either and will cause issues down the line with the natural way your body wants to rid of the waste using your muscles."
RATS,f82wbea,t3_dypej4,1574199468.0,Just be sure to give them plenty of free time out from the cage. They say a hour a day but honestly they could use more. I try for 2 due to my rats' energy levels.

When she seems put out with me in amy way while I am uoset it is awful. It is still a struggle. Really, I do mot want much from her during those times. I just want her to come sit next to me and be open to listening to me. I wamt her to tell me it is alright and she loves me after listening. 

I feel I have given myself away my entire life and qhen my BPD was triggered I just need what I have given.

Your situation sounds different. It can be difficult but maybe if you just tell him you love him he can chill out? Do what is best for you though. You do have to tip toe in these times and I am sure it is exhausting. I suggest magnesium to take the edge off for him and get him into therapy."
