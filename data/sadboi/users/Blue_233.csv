You are in an abusive household, your majoring in something you don’t like and you don’t think you will be able to get a job that will be able to pay off your loans, so just leave. Take some money from your family or whatever you can get and then go to Korea or NYC or where ever you want. Yeah you might be homeless at first but eventually it will get better and you will be able to live somewhere, and i believe that being homeless but working on accomplishing your dream is way better than having an abusive home with a miserable life. Just start a new life. Good luck on whatever you do. ❤️"
lgbt,fmn6p9c,t1_fmhog1w,1586219347.0,"I have no clue where you got your numbers, first of all you said bi was both the same as poly and the same as pan which is impossible, according to you if your attracted to all genders you can be bi or if your attracted to most but not all you can be bi, its one or the other it cant be both. You’re basically saying that poly, bi, and pan are the same thing which they aren’t. The prefix bi means 2 which means 2 genders, now people add non-binary into bisexual which would make 2-3 genders, if your attracted to more than that its poly and if your attracted to all its pan"
lgbt,fmhade4,t1_fjinp94,1586072266.0,"The way you explain it makes it sound the bi and poly are the same thing which they aren’t, my understanding is that bi is 2-3 genders, it can be any 2-3 genders but if its anymore than 3 then its poly."
lgbt,fmh9t2q,t3_fd7kuo,1586071666.0,"Btw the question isn’t rude, it would be rude if you assumed what the things meant. They are all under the same umbrella but they are different things. I don’t wanna offend anyone by saying this but what I consider as bisexuality is where you are attracted to people who are the same gender as you, the opposite gender and nonbinary people. Pansexuality is where you are attracted to all genders. And polysexuality is where your attracted to most genders but not all."
TrueOffMyChest,fmh978q,t3_fuqm8x,1586071037.0,"I’m pretty sure your talking about polyamorous which is completely different from polysexual, but if you really are talking about polysexuality then its not polysexuality that is stupid... its you. Polysexuals are attracted to most genders but not all, that doesnt mean that we date multiple people at once. Get your facts straight before you post shit."
