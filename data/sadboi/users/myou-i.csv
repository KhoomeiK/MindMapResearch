niziproject,fqagyge,t3_ghp850,1589218896.0,"I‚Äôm glad things are back to normal. As much as I understand people mass voting for the girls was done with good intentions, it‚Äôs not fair and I think it gives them false hope if anything :("
ACTrade,fq77pxa,t3_gh5zak,1589142866.0,It took me a minute to understand what this post was even about lol. Thanks for the laugh I needed it

Anxiety,fpr2kal,t3_geiyn7,1588840122.0,"Yes... and when I try to make myself better and attempt the task, if anything goes wrong I freak out :/ the reason I haven‚Äôt been doing any of my school online work for two weeks now"

introvert,fm45llg,t3_fsuo44,1585747064.0,This punched me three times in the face
ProRevenge,ff8ectl,t1_ff7ww65,1579674912.0,"Damn, yeah I guess seeing your comment made me realise that there are quite a few problems here... sucks to trust a good read I guess. Thank you for pointing it out!! üòá"
JapaneseFood,ff5jwb9,t3_ern5ex,1579596368.0,That is so adorable!! <3
teenagers,ff5ju2b,t3_ernasj,1579596279.0,yeah I‚Äôd upvote that tbh
AskReddit,ff5jsog,t3_ero8mj,1579596225.0,I think she‚Äôd probably feel a bit sad for me. My 13yo self had much bigger dreams than I do now... even in a short period of time I‚Äôve become a lot more cynical.
ProRevenge,ff5i6bh,t3_erkemp,1579593989.0,"Omg, this was definitely worth the read. I‚Äôm so glad someone like Karen will never have the chance to work with kids anymore, you‚Äôve done an amazing thing."
AskReddit,fenlvlz,t3_eq4n5r,1579287471.0,"This morning, I was crying my eyes out and sat at the bottom of the stairs just generally feeling awful. My cat came over almost immediately saying hello to me, purring away and letting me cuddle him while I calmed down. 

Anyone saying that cats don‚Äôt care, my cats are the absolute best and always try their best to make me feel better :)"
depression,fenlmq8,t3_cml6ni,1579287322.0,"Completely snapped today. The straps on my bag broke and I had a panic attack in my car in the middle of the car park.

I managed to get into school even if I was a bit late, but it‚Äôs like a dark cloud following me. Why does everything feel like one step forward two steps back? I‚Äôm trying so hard to get better but nothing seems to work."
depression,fekqbvy,t3_cml6ni,1579205411.0,"I think I‚Äôm alright at the moment. But I have such massive fear for the future because my mood switches like a button. Honestly it‚Äôs scaring me a little.

I‚Äôve been reaching out to people more. I‚Äôm trying to trust my mum and talk to her more because I know it hurts her when I withdraw. Problem is that it‚Äôs incredibly draining. I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted most of the time.

I‚Äôll keep trying for them. Maybe tomorrow will be better üíó"
socialanxiety,feagkrg,t3_eo9a13,1578948511.0,"Honestly you just put it into words. I feel like I‚Äôm always in the background, that even though I have friends I‚Äôm only something they‚Äôre temporarily interested in.

It‚Äôs sad, and even sadder to find someone else who feels the same way :("
introvert,feae955,t3_eo4my6,1578947564.0,I find the complete opposite haha... lots of my friends see me as smart when I‚Äôm actually really behind on schoolwork and not confident to speak up about it :/
