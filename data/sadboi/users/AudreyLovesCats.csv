AmItheAsshole,fr2d5jr,t1_fr2awc0,1589835242.0,"Exactly. If it were my grandparents (if they were still alive), Id call them. My uncle is 43 and a large business owner and although I know he loves me, honestly he sounds annoyed when I call him because he’s ALWAYS working. Like 10-15 hours a day, everyday. So texting him is easier for both of us because he can get back to me when he’s not so busy and I have really bad phone anxiety."

He already has a good disc collection going (14) but for Christmas I got him a nice disc holder bag (he’s been using a crappy canvas bag we got at a local shop), a putter and distance driver he’s had his eye on, and the foldable Innova basket so he can play in the backyard. I’m so excited to give them to him! Hope he likes it."
relationship_advice,f9kguno,t3_e5eso7,1575400169.0,"I’m dealing with the exact same issue. I love my boyfriend so much but he sucks at gifts and it makes me disappointed at every gift-giving occasion. For our anniversary, I made him a scrapbook of all the places we’ve been with our pictures at that place and cut out maps and went all out at the craft store to make it look professionally made, as well as a couple small things I saw and thought of him. Also made dinner and dessert for him and all he got me was a stuffed cat because “I like cats.” I felt really sad actually and I know my face was showing it. I would never expect anything expensive but just something that shows he cares about the time we’ve spent together. I got him all the stuff he wanted for Christmas and some thoughtful little things to show I care and I know he’s not gonna do the same for me. I love his face when he opens the gifts and will keep giving him effort in my gifts but I know he won’t do the same and it’s disappointing."

bipolar2,eub7ebs,t3_cfd2ex,1563641404.0,"Yep! At 12, I was told I had clinical depression. It just never felt right. I wasn’t always depressed, everything came in waves. I was never told about bipolar type 2 until I was diagnosed with it. I’d known about type 1, of course, and thought that was the only kind of bipolar disorder there was but I knew that wasn’t right as I don’t get manic episodes like those with type 1. When my psychiatrist said “I believe you have bipolar disorder” I thought she was nuts, but when it was explained, I actually smiled because it was me to a tee. I’m still trying to find the right medication and a regimen that works for me but I’m glad I know what’s wrong with me."
