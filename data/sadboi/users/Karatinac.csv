BattlefrontTWO,fq5pujw,t1_fq5hd06,1589114057.0,"SpideyAR made really good points. It really depends what type of play you're good at. I was terrible with assault at the beginning so only played Officer and Heavy, after I ranked those up I went back to Assault and now it's my favourite class. Just need to test them out. Better guns for each class the more you play.

For heroes, pretty much everyone is terrible when they first start. Try co-op as you can play as heroes against Ai. HvV can be very one-sided, most of the time 1 side just destroys the other and sometimes you get close matches (which are the best).

For HvV you need to stick with your team and don't run in by yourself. If you are the last person alive, run and try to find a teammate spawning in. If there is a player who is just way better than you, do not engage by yourself - try to take them down with a teammate. If I come across a player who just constantly blocks and takes ages to fight, I usually just turn around and try to help my team or kill someone else.

Lightsaber heroes have a stamina bar, if it runs out you can't block and do less damage so you need to retreat and not swing or block till it comes back. You want to be blocking a lot, trying to get behind enemy lightsaber heroes by dodging. Try dodging towards them and behind them so their lightsaber swing can't hit you (works as blaster heroes too). If you're a blaster hero stick extra close to your team but try not to get too close to enemy force users.

You pretty much need to learn what each character's abilities are so you know how to counter them. Try looking in the collection menu of each hero and look at their abilities. It really is just practice."

fo76,fo6jes3,t3_g5xtqb,1587560300.0,"Power Armour - the power armour chassis weighs 10 and if you put all of the power armour sections in the chassis it still only weighs 10. So basically try not to carry around spare pieces of power armour and keep them in the chassis. 

If the power armour pieces are too high level, take them out of the chassis and enter it. Get out of the chassis and put the armour back in it, the chassis will automatically go back into your inventory after 60 secs. So you can keep high level armour in your chest until you are the right level. Hope that makes sense.

You can rename weapons/armour etc. You hover over it in pipboy, inspect it and then rename. I renamed all my armour to ""1 Right Leg, 1 Left Leg"" etc. so it's easy to find.

Pick up everything and continually scrap it at work benches you find, this clears up loads of room to pick up more and then store it in your chest. You can ""Bulk"" scrap at a Tinker Bench and then sell it to vendors.

In Charisma there is a card which gives better prices at vendors (I have 3 star of this). There is also a 1 star card which costs less to fast travel. Some cards can be swapped out if you need to use something else, for example you can swap in Lock pick cards when you come across a safe and then swap it back to a different card you use normally.

Mutations are really good but don't bother with them until you get 2 cards in 'Luck' (fully ranked up) 1 makes it so you can't mutate or lose mutations and the other lessens the side effects (sorry can't remember names). If you don't have these cards you will lose your mutation if you use rad away. Marsupial mutation is great - gives you high jump and more carry weight."

But at higher levels it won't work great, if you're against a good team 1 person can just loop you the entire match which lets other players do gens as you said.

deadbydaylight,fnmp8wh,t3_g2nr71,1587075563.0,"Probably Franklins for me. If I bring an item 90% of the time it's a medkit, I play solo so I love my medkits üò≠"

deadbydaylight,fnmnji0,t3_g2no2n,1587074657.0,"Dude don't feel bad, this game has one of the biggest learning curves I've come across. It was probably months before I even considered myself 'decent' at the game. I've pretty much played this game 99% of the time solo so I had no one to guide me either. Don't worry about rank, it doesn't really matter. 

Try watching some let's plays on YouTube or tutorial videos for new players. There's so many things they don't tell you about unless you search for it or happen to experience it.

I'd practice looping and figure out which perks work for you. Keep at it and you'll get there eventually üòä"
deadbydaylight,fnl7ijb,t1_fnkhyuk,1587048485.0,"Yep, I'm exactly the same. There's just no point in not cleansing if the entire team keeps doing it."
deadbydaylight,fnl6fts,t3_g27sof,1587047902.0,"I also used to struggle with ranking, I'd seem to pip okay but then I'd get a couple really bad matches in a row and lose a rank. I stopped caring about rank and escaping a long time ago. I focused on getting better at looping and getting the mechanics down.

I'm much better now and usually get at least 1 pip every match (unless it's just a horrendous round). Don't worry about ranking and just focus on improving, you might look at your rank one day and realise it's the furthest you've gotten."

AskWomen,fnjeh2r,t3_g20mta,1586997327.0,"I feel like some people dismiss your opinion more if you're quite or speak up less :/ Also thinking that people won't believe me or think I'm lying. 

The first time I finally admitted to myself and another person that I had mental health problems was on a school trip at the end of high-school. I basically had a breakdown and the teacher I told laughed in my face and said ""No you don't"". The teacher called me a liar, refused to let me call my parents or leave. If I had trust issues before but this certainly didn't help.

It's incredibly disheartening to voice your opinion or reveal a truth about yourself and get called a liar for your efforts. 

I think I'm better than I was with voicing my opinion but now sometimes I think, why even bother? Especially if all you're going to get is a negative response but it really depends on the situation."

Sooo if it happened at that point it would be whatever potential he had past that, unless that was him at his most powerful stage. So if he doesn't get stronger than that it won't work, if that makes sense lol üòÖ"
HunterXHunter,fnjbc1w,t3_g21ezl,1586995556.0,"Yeah I'm interested in it too, this has one of the most intriguing powers systems I've seen. Like how far can they take their abilities within their categories? Are certain categories more lenient with what abilities they can have?"
HunterXHunter,fnjaqb9,t1_fnj0d03,1586995223.0,"Yeah, slight oversight there."
HunterXHunter,fnjae2d,t3_g212b6,1586995033.0,"Yeah it's just that he mentions it whenever he can. Just came from a post about someone asking what the Bungee Gum properties were (couldn't tell if it was genuine or not, people are dumb on the web ya  know?). Someone commented seriously and they got down voted. Didn't realise people took Bungee Gum memes so seriously lol üßê"
HunterXHunter,fnj9io3,t1_fnj8prh,1586994546.0,OK so it is just everyone trolling. Yes Bungee gum definitely doesn't possess the properties of both rubber and gum.
HunterXHunter,fnj87g1,t1_fniwbvq,1586993822.0,"Why does your comment have down votes? I'm confused as what you said seems pretty accurate.
It's just a weird gum substance but not confirmed."

OP I think it looks great."
