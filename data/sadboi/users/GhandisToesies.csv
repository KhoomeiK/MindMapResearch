Sure it’s not fun going against a smurf in low elo, but I think it should be taken as a learning experience, seeing how they rolled you sort of thing and using it whenever u can next time to roll more people and climb out of elos."

Overwatch,et8e6yd,t1_et8e2rr,1562554023.0,noo. most people don’t take quickplay seriously. U wont be able to learn the hero competently. why do u think there’s so many mercy mains who play widow everywhere else? or plats who wreck at widow ffa? they just don’t have the game sense. most of the times it’s because they don’t know how to play widow at the level they play mercy at. if you want to learn heroes competitively u gotta play comp.
