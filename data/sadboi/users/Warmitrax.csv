depression,fdl83w1,t3_elwq1m,1578518648.0,"Hi there,

since you asked in above comments..... I wouldn't mind, if you'd donate ""only"" 10%, 15%, 20%.
30% may sound small, but it can actually be much. You'll still have to pay rent ( if you don't own property ), wages, materials, electricity, heating costs etc.

It's honorable enough, that you'd like to share your (future) company's income. Therefore, I'd buy something from your store, knowing that it helps others. You also wrote, that you'd like to stay 100% transparent. If that's the case, people may be more likely to buy something, just for support.

I don't know where you live or where you'd like to sell/ship your products, but as an idea of mine, you could try to help the affected ones and not the organizations.
Since in the USA for example, many can't afford insurance or a therapist ( statutory health insurance would be smart ). Also, the organizations get just enough income, while offering help.

Or did you mean to donate to organizations that do research?

I can't think of a name, yet but I'll let you know, if I have any ideas.

Have a great one."

Every mistake I do and every time I fall back into the spiraling thoughts, I hate myself and the world more.

And even though there are some good times, I know, that in the end, I will be suicidal again. In the end, I don't rlly feel much better at all. I can't seem to escape this hell, even with a therapist and meds.... I kind of tried to end it, already.
I don't know how, but at the moment, I am continuing to live. But I am 99,9% sure, that I will end it some day. But until then....something might happen, that will change everything.

Take 1 day at a time and struggle ( to be honest, it's the only word to describe this, since it truly is a struggle ) yourself through the day. Hopefully, you will find some things each day, that will make you stay just a little longer. And maybe these little things will add up, until you can really escape. 
I am doing the same and I hope you can collect those little achievements each day, as well.

And hopefully, you have some good friends/family, that value your life and the time you are spending with them. 
Sometimes, it might be the only thing, that is preventing someone from ending it."

But you could end up missing something really great..... I know, that is something you might hear often, but it's true. You don't know what the future might bring and you don't know, what death will bring you. It might be worse.

I haven't found a purpose to live, yet. But all I can do is to hold on and hope for the best.

Try to get strength from every little achievement. And let it ""only"" be to get up early in the morning and do something (go to school/work or whatever).
