unpopularopinion,fivo2g2,t1_fiuzm0h,1582764311.0,"Idk if this helps at all but I'm bipolar 2. I tried to end my life 5 times before I turned 19. Got really close a couple times. Anyway I did that because I was in so much pain, there was no hope in my life. The only solution was to kill myself. I really wanted to find peace in death.

That being said the two most painful times in my life were physical. I literally tried to kill myself a bunch of times but jesus christ when my 7 inch ovarian cyst ruptured during sex, woo boy I wanted to die for a whole new reason. I begged for death through tears. I had NEVER felt pain like that. I had to have surgery and do PTSD therapy. I was literally puking for 5 hours hysterical af. Second time was when I had salmonella poisoning on a sail boat in Mexico with no AC, shade, or clean water. 

So idk I'd have to say in my experience, physical pain has exceeded my emotional pain. Maybe it's because I was so sick for so long mentally that I got used to it, maybe it's because I'm a pussy. Who can say really."

bipolar2,f5yt8jd,t3_dpo4sj,1572561326.0,"IT GETS BETTER!! You are now on the road to recovery my friend, which is beautiful. Look into DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) if you dont want to waste any time. It needs to be a daily intensive program to get the most out of it. 

Also EMDR with a therapist can be something to work towards when you become more stable. It has helped with my PTSD.

It took 5 suicide attempts, two stints in rehab, weekly therapy/monthly psychiatrist vistis, 4 medications, DBT, and hard core structure to get me where I am today... which is still bipolar BUT highly functioning and very low key bouts of hypo and slight depression. 

NEVER give up on your mental health. I didnt get the right medication cocktail for ten years but it was worth the wait.

Some hypo/manic symptoms to look out for:
- increased spending 
- increased sex drive/interest in others
- rapid speech 
- desire to travel/run away 
- laughing easily
- feeling yourself (this is a big sign for me lol)
- relating to every song you listen to 
- daydreaming/being distracted 
- losing interest in things you care about 
- gaining interest in new things
- obsessing ******
- increased cleaning/organization 
- irritation
- anger
- defensiveness 
- higher than usual energy
- decreased sleep 
- lack of empathy/guilt
- rationalizing
- wanting to get fucked up
- sneaking around/lying 

These are things I deal with, I'm sure others can expand on it. I listed them because I dont seem to know I'm hypo until I self assess and check my list of symptoms. 

I know right away when I'm feeling depressed though.

If you need someone to talk to while navigating this difficult time message me :)"

When I was in 3rd grade my teeth were really large for my head and bucked out with a huge gap. My brother called me a buck tooth beaver. 

So at my school the popular kids sat in the middle of the table and the further out you were from them, the less popular. I was pretty far from my crush but I heard him tell a joke so I laughed. 

He looked over at me, pointed, and yelled ""you look like a buck tooth beaver!!"" Of course everyone laughed. Hell, surrounding tables were laughing. So loud we were silenced for the remainder of lunch by the mean old lunch lady. 

I didn't get a chance to even talk to my bff about it because the lunch lady was watching us. I didn't cry in front of them, I knew it would make it worse. 

The next day I was expected to write something nice about said crush, and I pulled the teacher aside to tell her I couldn't think of anything nice to say. She told me to write something generic so I did. 

Nothing ever came of it, except he got held back a grade and never grew past 5 ft. No joke he was very small until the last time I saw him when he was 18. In the end I hope he grew, being that small in high school is punishment enough."

Second of all, yes miss you need to accept that you're gay and get support from the gay community. It's strange that it repulses you but you're confused why straight women are repulsed by lesbians advances as well? Hypocracy at it's finest. 

Thirdly, you need to face your entitlement. You are not entitled to romantic attention from anyone. You're a masochist if you keep going after straight women who will never give you what you want. 

Some women like sucking dick and penetration. The thought of eating pussy doesnt resonate with them. Also it's sick to persistently try to turn someone gay OR STRAIGHT when they are not. It's just wrong man.

unpopularopinion,eucdbtz,t1_eubtbnt,1563671879.0,"I honestly do feel more like myself if I smoke in the AM, people forget it's a medicine or are just ignorant and compare it to hard drugs.

CANNABIS HELPS PEOPLE GET OFF DRUGS. I have horrible crippling pain that I've been prescribed opioids for because sometimes I cant get out of bed. I get terrible stomach issues when administered to me after surgeries but if I have a choice I wont take them.

Ibuprofen isnt a daily solution for me so I use cannabis and it works. Funnily enough my doctor recommended cannabis over anything else for my type of health issues. 

Before the pitchforks come out, I am actively trying to get better because I dont want pain management to be long term. I would rather just feel better :( 

Also I haven't had a drop of alcohol for over 5 years because I have this silly problem of trying to commit suicide and hurt myself with knives when I get drunk. Which was every time I drank. Thankfully cannabis helps me not even crave it anymore. 

I'm 100% better with cannabis use than when I was completely sober or drinking/abusing drugs. 

If anything gets in the way of your life its a good idea to stop. For me, cannabis is a HUGE benefit."

bipolar2,eu6o9bm,t1_eu6elb3,1563504901.0,"Damn.. I'm not trying to be rude at all and you do not have to answer, what makes it worth it to stay with someone so close minded about mental health when you're bipolar? 

I bet if he knew you before medicating or how bad it gets before meds he would probably really appreciate them. I understand ignorance but it's harmful behaviour that you shouldn't have to put up with. 

Don't let him persuade you to feel ashamed about your bipolar, especially when you're pro-actively keeping it under control."

AmItheAsshole,eu4yrmo,t1_eu3vivv,1563466193.0,"Jesus everyone on this site is judgemental. I never said it was ""the truth I saw while on an acid trip"" i said my belief system comes from personal experience with psychedelics. 

That includes mescalin (used in religious practices), ayahuasca (used in religious practices), and DMT which is directly from the ayahuasca root. 

You'll be happy to know I cant have kids due to endometriosis so I wont have the chance to be the craziest worst parent in the world."
AmItheAsshole,eu3628z,t3_ce6hrv,1563406295.0,"YTA, this sub is hilarious. One minute its ""mind your own business"" the next it is condoning you for getting involved in someone else's medical conditions. Alcoholism is very hard for non-alcoholic people to understand. People who drink like this are usually trying to escape reality. She needs her husband (not you!) to encourage her to get mental health help. What if she turns it around and gets sober? What if she is put on medication and she gets better? Because of you, if her new liver fails she won't get another, even if her life choices stop offending you. 

I understand people saying she deserves it because she is taking away someone else's chance. I'd like to remind people that all lives are equal and just because she is suffering from a disease (addiction) she doesn't deserve it. She needs HELP not some rando making her future medical decisions for her."

I'm 25 now and not religious at all. I do believe in a higher power due to some psychedelic trips I've experienced and the warm fuzzies of feeling like everything will be alright it I try hard to make them that way. 

I was atheist for most of my life and 100% respect it and know that it has absolutely nothing to do with moral code."

unpopularopinion,etx7mkz,t1_etwvlze,1563293334.0,"Yeah idk if it's mental illness or just flat out annoyance from people on public transit that blew it out of proportion and made it personal. Then all these dweebs jumped on the band wagon. 

I'll say this from experience. Mental illness makes people self absorbed, we worry about ourselves not other people as much. In a way where I would be self conscious of spreading my legs and offending someone not the other way around. 

If I did get offended by people, it's murderers and rapists and racists and shit. People who ACTUALLY make this world a worse place, almost unlivable. Now I'm medicated and smoke cannabis all day so all I worry about is killing it at work lol"
