As far as projecting goes the ones who were so super sad at the funeral hadn't seem them in years before they died and I had spent tons of time hanging out with them and just hearing their stories.  They said I didn't care about them because I didn't cry enough but I wasnt sad knowing that they were ready to pass.  It was way more depressing to hang out with my grandpa who's wife had been dead for 7 years than it was to see him pass relatively peacefully. I dont give a fuck about me or anyone else dying because its inevitable and to pretend we have some meaningful control is pretty silly.  Shouldn't you have religion or something telling you that this is God's plan for humanity.  Easy to say you care about the people around you while saying you care about them too much to give them a better future and not have any red flags pop up in your head.  I get that it's sad and shit but I'm pretty confused overall with how I'm supposed to feel about it.  I haven't seen the news since before this shit started but I'm very familiar with it thanks to people who care about it.  Shit hasnt changed at all for me because I dont see very many people.  I'm even alone 90%of the time at work.  I feel like this is pointless and you're just going to keep saying you're righteous as fuck because you ride the cdcs dick.  I'm very pro science and I know they are right when it comes to the spread of this shit but I disagree with the idea that we have to shut down everything just to make sure we dont lose a tiny fraction of people when we know that something much worse is almost guaranteed to be coming our way in the near future.  I'm all for the idea of shutting down the majority of society but people gotta eat and I dunno if people are ready for the fiasco that's ready to pop off when people cant feed their family's in the big cities.

I basically have to rely on standing up for myself right away because if theres a real confrontation I'm gonna be having to find a new job or a lawyer and I dont like jail.  Sometimes people still try to bully me but when you're showing everyone that you stand up for yourself and keep a cool head then everyone else will see what's going on and you can decide what you want to do about it when you really have to so something if that time ever comes while not looking crazy because if someone wants to bully you when you have a backbone then they will always look crazier than you."

My boss calls me on the phone and we discuss a serious topic.  I then make a sarcastic joke about it to try to lighten the mood and laugh a little to show that it was sarcasm.  My boss fucking hates me and I'm amazed I still have a job there, and its mostly due to my dumb fucking jokes that almost seem like a fucking compulsion.

mentalhealth,fmdsjjl,t3_fujecm,1585976607.0,"Its not a competition.  Its important to recognize that your problems arent as bad as they could be, but that doesn't mean they arent problems for you.  You dont have to drink a fifth to get out of bed in order to qualify as an official alcoholic despite what some people will tell you.  Everything is on a spectrum and noone really knows what it's like to live in someone else's head. 

If you recognize tendencies of yours that you would like to change then that's a healthy thing to do.  Anyone can go to therapy and theres no benefit to defining yourself by a mental illness.  It can be beneficial to get a diagnosis to come up with an effective treatment plan but that doesn't mean that it's all that you are or all that you'll ever be.

All that being said, anxiety is a serious issue that causes a lot of damage in my life and many others lives as well.  People often view it as ""just anxiety"" but, in my opinion, it causes people a huge amount of distress and finding ways to manage it is extremely challenging because of the addictiveness and abuse potential of the drugs often used to treat it.  Sorry to end on kind of a negative note but I dont really have any good solutions.  I have stuff that works for me sometimes and that same stuff makes it so much worse at other times.  Having friends that you're comfortable sharing your feelings with can be really helpful but I know how hard that is to find.  I kind of doubt that you're just blowing your problems out of proportion but if you are then stop, the stigma is pretty shitty and how are you gonna help your friends that ""have it so much worse"" if you cant be honest with yourself about how you really feel.

In the end it mostly comes down to how big is the material you're gonna be cutting.  A chop saw is great but honestly even the little handheld bandsaws cut faster.  Its also nice being able to cut stuff one handed standing on a ladder if you feel like it.  For cutting stuff once or twice a month a hacksaw probably makes the most sense but a bandsaw is just a cool hacksaw so I get it.  Go to any machine shop and you'll find a big horizontal bandsaw because it's the absolute fastest way to remove material.

You cant leave work because you're sad and you're coworkers are happy either.

RVLiving,fj9uapl,t1_fj8yrmw,1583159771.0,Yeah I have mine on batteries right now.  It's more of a fun project that's teaching me a lot about DC circuits so I'm enjoying it but it's not cost effective.  I need the soldering practice too

Jk I try to wear gloves but it's hard with leather and I go through my maxi flex ones like candy but they do work well.  I enjoy cleaning out my nails with my knife but I'll touch up with my nail brush if that doesn't get them clean
OCD,fj8cwou,t1_fj4yk05,1583110456.0,I asked her about but after describing what happens in my head in these situations along with some more severe situations she thinks it's more related to brain damage from several TBIs.  I'm gonna see my pcp for a referral to a neurologist asap and hope theres some treatment options

electricians,fj4uh2s,t1_fj3xwg1,1583017173.0,I use easy anchors(the metal self drilling ones)  all the time for stuff that's not heavy but they dont even compare to toggles.  I've held up 400lb equipment with 1/2 toggles in cinderblock
metalworking,fj4rz17,t1_fj4b2dl,1583015473.0,Just here to say I would pay 30-40$ for a slick little thing like that.  Very cool and I'm tempted to make my own but if you decide to sell them you have a customer until I figure it out for myself.  I'm a bit slow so you probably have some time
mentalhealth,fj4qx74,t1_fj3hz73,1583014755.0,It can also happen much faster than that.  Most Americans are a couple missed paychecks from homelessness.  I wish I could just take disability for a couple months when it gets bad but instead I just have to suck it up and try not to get fired
electricians,fj3w1bh,t1_fj2v3d3,1582994507.0,Yeah that's pretty much exactly what it is Haha.  Just happens all the time and it gets old.  I dunno what they can really do for nerve damage anyway if it is there.  Maybe I'm just a scarediecat

Tools,fj2muqi,t1_fj2lp08,1582947835.0,I'm always tempted to pull out my cobras but they always cut into the fitting and rust is a big enough problem already.  Those Raptors look great but I think jd have the same clearance issues.  Might be good for other rusty bolts though
Tools,fj2m7d2,t1_fj1knhq,1582947322.0,My dewalt brushless impact has settings.  On 1 it wont use the impact until it stops and you keep holding the trigger.  Good for counting the ugga duggas.  On 2 or 3 it's a monster waiting to be unleashed
Tools,fj2m14j,t1_fiz1hyw,1582947185.0,I use hes keys all the time. The hex bits are great too  but hexes are the only thing I'd use keys for and that's because torque is the name of the game with those bad boys.  My torque screwdriver has hex bits but it rarely fits where a key would.  If it does fit thats great but I like my hex keys
Tools,fj2l8la,t1_fizivrl,1582946580.0,Yeah I'm using a set of open end right now and its the only thing that works a lot of the time.  We have a few cut down to length because of the space limitations on the fittings that had to be reached.  I'm gonna get my boss to grab some service wrenches
Tools,fj2l1lv,t3_faomjk,1582946433.0,"Lots of great suggestions here.  I think I can convince my boss to grab a big set of service wrenches and I'll probably still grab a 10"" pliers wrench for myself because they look handy as fuck when they fit."
Tools,fj2kusp,t1_fizn0sv,1582946293.0,That would be heinous to use that shit on hydraulic fittings not to mention its head is too big most if the time
Tools,fj2krxj,t1_fj1z6d5,1582946233.0,I have a set of crow foot but it just doesn't end up being effective in  most cases.  Great when they work though
Tools,fj2kngc,t1_fj290tq,1582946140.0,It's on a pretty expensive rig and theres a lot of hydraulics going on so theres a lot of bug fittings like that in tight spots and you are 100% right about not using pliers on them.  The fittings are way more expensive than a new hose and resale value has to stay high in this case.  Haha case because it's a case.  I think in gonna get a set of those service wrenches.  I can still do the final tightening/breaking loose with an open end but working them off should be much easier with those.  I'd like to get a big set of hose wrenches but I don't think my boss would go for something that pricey and even then a lott of them you have to come straight in because of how crowded it is.

Edit: I wouldn't call those diagonal cutters either but they do have the same cutting action as dikes/side cutters and I've heard dikes get called nippers plenty of times as well.  Same shit different ergonomics.  It is just a beveled cutter at an offset angle from the handle so dikes isnt really wrong just misleading because the angle is 90 degrees"

Tools,fiyo8l9,t3_faiymr,1582843332.0,Nice kit.  Maybe an extension for the sockets but it looks like you could do a lot with that kit.
Tools,fixvyvy,t1_fiwc6dq,1582827603.0,"Sure.  The linesmen were 50-60$ I think.  The Klein flathead was 5$.  The knipex are 25-45$ depending where you look, I think I paid 30$.  The thread guage I dont know and the bitholder I think I paid 25$ and it came with some nice bits.  Dewalt brushless impact was in a combo kit with the drill for 199 I think but its been a while.  I think the milawakee apex was 5$ or thereabouts."

Tools,fiw1agk,t1_fiv5se2,1582772778.0,These are just thread forming/roll taps/dies.  They make a thread by displacing material instead of removing it.  Reshaping instead of cutting leaves more original material to work with.  Hard to hand tap a new thread like this but great for fixing jacked up threads

Tools,fis3ubp,t1_fiq4r8w,1582677169.0,I haven't used that specific model but I'd check the belt tension and see if it looks like it's been slipping.  Next would be to see if the motor is overheating or the chuck is failing.  The sound it makes when it stops should tell you quite a bit
Tools,fip5y8b,t1_fip4lbj,1582598762.0,MSC direct is the only way to go for drill bits.  You know exactly what kind of steel you're getting in your bits and prices are great.
Tools,fip51za,t3_f926s0,1582598193.0,"I think an 11 in 1 and a small flathead are good for most situations.  If it's for your house you then might as well grab a dedicated set + 11 in 1.  The 11 in 1 will work almost all the time but you have the dedicated if you have to get into a tight spot and the squares and torx on the 11 in 1 can be handy when you might not have a dedicated for those.

I think another good solution is grabbing a bit driver set and a magnetic tip driver to hold them since that would include some longer bits to fit into tight spots and the different squares and torx you'll need once in a while all together.  Plus they work in your drill"
