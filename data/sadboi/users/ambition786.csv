I think part of it has/had to do with what you're looking for in your SO. Funny thing is neither of us even started speaking with the intention to marry at first... Then we spoke haha. But so with regards to signs, it was a gut feeling, I also did have my grandmother who passed away 10 years ago now come into my dreams for the first time ever and give me her blessings with regards to him. It was one of those clear dreams that I could never forget and I can't think it was coincidental knowing my history and types of dreams/nightmares I would get on the daily. I don't even think I would have done Istekhaara but I guess me just being super anxious felt like I eventually needed to, although I was 100% sure I wanted to marry this guy and would do anything in this universe for him.
