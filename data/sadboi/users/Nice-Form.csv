GradSchool,fr0iczg,t3_gligw7,1589796738.0,"Oh absolutely. I was horribly depressed before starting my masters last year, and I swore to myself I’d make a better life for myself in grad school. For the most part I did, but since the pandemic started and I had to go back home, I’ve been miserable and unfocused again. I feel awful about it because my supervisors are so kind and patient, while I’m a total disappointing mess. Like some days I literally have to put in a lot of effort just to not down all my Tylenol or gulp a bottle of bleach. :(

I’m on meds and in therapy, and my family’s super supportive, but I’m still so depressed."
2meirl4meirl,fr0hfo1,t1_fqx7elm,1589795777.0,"Eww yeah she was definitely leading you on then. If I were you I’d block her on social media, especially since seeing those notifications (understandably) hurts you so much. Besides she doesn’t deserve to have you as a friend, not even on fb. I know it’s hard to think of her in a negative light because you’re in love with her, but based on what you’ve told me I really don’t think she seems like a truly great person. At the very least she certainly isn’t healthy for you. I’m really sorry she hurt you so bad.

I can definitely see why it would be so hard to ask out other girls when you’re still fixated on that one, but it would at least give you an opportunity to escape from these past years of pain. You deserve WAY better than some immature girl who leads people on so she can feel desirable.

I think it’s great that you’re staying away from drugs and alcohol. When I would hang out with people at bars and they had a drink or two, they would get a LOT more personal than when sober. So if you aren’t comfortable being that vulnerable with your friends, you should definitely stay sober, especially since drugs/alcohol make your mood worse in the long run."

2meirl4meirl,fqwmgho,t1_fqvsk14,1589709914.0,"No need to apologize at all; depression subreddits like these are meant for people to vent without judgement and get some support. Especially since you’ve been in an incredibly painful situation for several years, there’s no need to feel guilty for “rambling”. It’s really messed up how men aren’t allowed to express their pain and just have to let it “build up without saying anything”. It’s not your fault, it’s just a really awful cultural norm. And thank you for sharing your feelings and experiences, because other people (myself included) go on Reddit so they can relate to and commiserate with other people.

You seem like a kind, genuine, and loving person, which are not only intrinsically excellent traits to have, but are also things women find VERY important/attractive in a serious partner.

I totally get what you mean about nice people; my crush tends to be kind, anxious, and shy towards everyone, so it was impossible to tell if he was into me or not until I confessed my feelings lol. You probably already thought of this but I’m going to ask it just in case: do you have that college girl’s contact info, or mutual friends who could give you it? If so, I definitely think it’s worth a shot to get in touch with her again and maybe you could ask her out once the pandemic blows over a bit, as long as you could handle just staying friends with her if she rejects you. But regardless of what happens, the fact that you’ve been attracted to someone besides your crush from high school means you are capable of loving again, perhaps even more strongly than you loved her! (Again though it must be really hard to see that possibility while you’re still in love with her so I don’t blame you for not believing it yet)

Okay I know I shouldn’t judge your crush from high school because I don’t know her or her situation, but wow, it’s kinda messed up that she’d hold your hand and cuddle with you yet expect you to think of her purely platonically. Maybe it’s just because I’m a bit conservative, but it does sound like she was leading you on bc I don’t think women generally cuddle with and hold hands with their friends, especially straight male friends. Did she do that with her other friends? If not, then yeah, she was leading you on and you dodged a bullet. Ugh, people who play with other people’s hearts make me so mad!

Congrats on turning 21! I’ve never had a drop of alcohol and have rarely been to bars, so I’m probably not an expert on this stuff lol but I’m pretty sure therapists recommend against drinking if you have depression, since alcohol is a depressant. But I’m sure you could go to bars to socialize and not drink there! Once they reopen of course!"

I don’t mean to invalidate your experience as a guy, and please correct me if I’m wrong because I don’t want to just assume things, but I think “ugly” guys can still find love because women don’t care as much about looks and because there’s more variation in what different women find physically attractive; like my preference is definitely different from what’s considered conventionally attractive. Whereas a woman can’t get by with just a “great personality”. Sometimes I feel like beauty is a matter of survival if you’re a woman."
2meirl4meirl,fqv53nh,t1_fqth229,1589670043.0,"It’s been over two years and I’m still a mess lol, but thank you :)

You seem young. If you’re still in college, then that’s a great time to meet so many interesting people, way more than you’d meet in high school, especially since most high schoolers just aren’t interested in serious relationships. And even if you aren’t in college there are still plenty of other opportunities to find love.

I had a crush on someone in hs (though it wasn’t nearly as strong as yours), but because he was the only crush I ever had at the time, I assumed I wasn’t capable of having stronger feelings for anyone else. But a few years later I developed INCREDIBLY strong feelings for someone else (my current crush) and now I can’t imagine having those feelings (or stronger ones) for anyone else, but I could be proven wrong again.

I guess this is just a long-winded way to say, you can’t know for sure you won’t meet someone who totally blows your current crush out of the water, even though it’s impossible to imagine right now.

But yeah, this situation really sucks and it’s completely understandable that you feel broken, but you are not worthless and you’re wonderful for having the capacity to love someone so deeply. That ability will come in handy when you finally meet a woman who truly deserves and appreciates you."

If your school has a Muslim student association, you might find a couple other like-minded Muslims, although it’s still hard sometimes; I feel like most MSA students are pretty secure in their religion.

I’m also a Muslim in a master’s program, and even though my parents have been amazing to me (though no one’s perfect), I’m still struggling a LOT with my faith to the point where I think I’ll start exploring other religions.

Although I’ve been raised by and have met wonderful Muslims, I feel frustrated with some aspects of mainstream Muslim culture too. But it’s also incredibly condescending when non-Muslims just write off Islam as a barbaric religion with equally barbaric followers. Being a young western Muslim is so confusing and even alienating sometimes.

I’m so sorry for how your family’s treated you, and I really hope things work out well for you. If you can make it through your masters, you can probably get a good job afterwards and become more independent so hopefully you won’t feel as trapped then."

Are you allowed to go out on walks/hikes in your country? If so, that might be a good place to start, since it could at least let you enjoy the summer a bit. 

If you could just somehow get into a bit of a routine, that might help too. But I think you’ll have to accept that you might not be nearly as productive as usual; I know I haven’t!"

I usually like to dress feminine and wear a bit of makeup (although I’ve been really bad about it since quarantine) but even then I still feel ugly.

I definitely agree with what you said about women being told they have to look good. In fact, sometimes it feels like a matter of survival. I HAVE to be visually appealing to have a chance at not being lonely my entire life. I know friends and family are important, but it’s not the same as having a life partner. If I’m not pretty, what guy would ever want me? No one’s ever been interested in me, and the only guy I’ve ever truly clicked with rejected me. It shows that I’m not attractive enough and I have to somehow be prettier. I exercise pretty regularly and I’m almost underweight, but somehow I’m still hideous. Ugh it’s the worst!!"

I know the global situation is really messed up, but that doesn’t give me an excuse to be like this. Everyone else is in the same situation and they still manage to be “normal” and productive, so I should be able to too.

I’m done with classes and TA work until the fall, so now I should really focus on my project.

Funny you mention that. I actually did take a gap year to focus on therapy before starting grad school, because I was literally too depressed to function by the time I graduated from undergrad. 

And that’s what makes my situation even more frustrating; I had worked so hard to claw my way out of depression and I thought I managed to put it behind me (at least to an extent). Now I’m almost back to square one. :("

I’ve been seeing a therapist weekly, I’m on antidepressants, and my family’s been very supportive.

That said, I really don’t want to tell my supervisors anything about all this, not even a bit of it. I don’t want to subconsciously use my depression as an “excuse”. If I could hide my issues from my professors as an undergrad, I should be able to hide them now too. My program is two years long, so I just need to somehow push through the next year.

I’ve been having trouble making and sticking to a routine, but I think you’re right; routines are important."

UBC,fbuvb0p,t3_ediwnd,1577120936.0,"My grades dropped my last year of undergrad, and my depression got so bad I had to take a gap year after graduating and spend it in therapy. I thought I couldn’t get into grad school because of my bad grades my final year and because I “wasted” my gap year by not working, but I got accepted to my top choice and am much happier now.

So even though your depression may make you feel like you’ll never get into grad school because of that bad semester, it’s really not true, especially since grad school admissions is a holistic process. 

That said, I think your top priority should be improving your mental health (UBC counselling might be a good place to start); depression can take a toll on every aspect of your life, including academics. And more importantly, you don’t deserve to feel worthless and suicidal, or to be stuck in bed all day. You are capable of so much more, even if it feels impossible right now.

For now, if you’re still stuck in bed, then the next time you get up to eat or use the bathroom, maybe you could try to do something small for yourself, like changing into nice (but comfy) clothes, taking a warm shower, or having a quick chat with one of your family members."
