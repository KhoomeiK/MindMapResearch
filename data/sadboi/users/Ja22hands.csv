mixedrace,fr3o6us,t3_gmgcdp,1589861881.0,"In America one drop of black blood means you're black and a lot of people are so racist or so used to this being the norm that they actually feel the need to defend it ,and will get so offended if you don't agree. You are both . Not half a race ,you walk around with two full cultures inside of you at all times. There may be times when you are immersed in one of your cultures more than the other but that's expected considering they are separate cultures . The thing is black people are so used to being policed about their race that now they feel the need to police other degrees of black people about their blackness. (Keep in mind this was once the law) but what they are saying to you is ""oh don't think cause you mixed, looking exotic or whatever you think, that you not black ,you not better than us and they still think you're black"" at the same time though they are also saying ""no you not black enough to understand the struggle... first you don't look black enough so they don't treat you that bad so stop complaining ,second you have a whole other race to go to and hide from being black, we just got black and don't have the luxury of getting a pass "" Think of how Naomi Osaka got treated for being a ""half blood"" black people and Japanese alike didn't let her forget she was half  .Then there was commotion when she decided to represent Japan *rolls eyes*. This example happens often. The pressure to represent black is because in a way they need the most support and unity and when you don't you are guilt tripped by this need .In reality that mindset helps racism. Don't feel like you need to identify soley as black ,if you do you are conforming to their beliefs and making them think they are valid .That ""one drop of blood "" makes you tainted , when it doesnt ."

NRelationships,fpmqild,t1_fpmoirh,1588739106.0,"I know exactly how narcissists are . That's why I said marry him , (depending on the state) usually that means everything is each other's . Imagine him saying no ,throwing a tantrum ,calling the cops and ect. and now it's all documented ,and then there's nothing they can do about it because no laws are broken cause you're married .That was my whole take on it . Now that I know that he has already devalued you in order to make himself look good (classic narc) I have to agree that it is too far gone for the sweet and nice way out. The only advice I can offer is to not get caught up in his games . Yes the only thing he cares about is winning .If you play the narcs game you will lose .Don't ever forget that . Once you get good and start beating them at their game ,they switch up to something new all while making whatever you were doing look unethical.  You know what he really cares about (probably his image ) and what he doesn't care about use it all to your advantage. If he doesn't know that you know he's a narc don't tell him. You have to let him expose himself in this matter . Secretly record . Keep track and note things.Even if you can't use it because of the state you're in ,you will still have proof that he's a narc. Dot your i's and cross your t's and stay on top of everything. Don't give him any ammunition.Try to surround yourself with whoever is left on your side tell them about the abuse if you can so you'll have allies.Also this will get even more mentally exhausting (as you know )so focus on yourself and your mental health above all else. I'm so sorry you have to go through this."
NRelationships,fpmd5p2,t1_fpmautt,1588730493.0,"Normally I would never advise someone to be in or go back to an abusive relationship .But this is not normal. He already has the control .They get married his money is her money now .She can spend it with no issues and ect . She's leaving and has to pretend to stroke his ego anyways ,she might as well get the most of out it and take that as far as she can. He won't even suspect it and being a narc will actually think he's sweeping her off her feet and is in love with him and dumb all over again . This also helps with smoothing over talking to a lawyer if he knows about it.She can easily say she was going to leave but now he's made it all better. Just a suggestion. Especially since this is hopeless."
NarcissisticAbuse,fpluf4w,t3_gdwpgr,1588719674.0,"Yes.

I can't afford therapy and if I could I would get therapy and I'm sure you feel the same. I'm not a vengeful person either but I did some digging and this is what I got.

1. Sign them up for all kinds of things using their info 
spam callers ,junk mail ... the internet is vast so it's whatever floats your boat really.

2. Since they are girls and probably use makeup you can break a brush or other tool and lightly put it back  or dry /wet/spill something and put it back 

3. Don't just move furniture. Move everything. Keys ,food items , whatever it may be it's here, well at least it was just a second ago.

4. Don't stop at displacing things. Make them have to replace some things .....throw away one sock to a favorite pair ,get rid of the silverware one fork at a time,take the backs to earrings or misplace an actual earring....Remember it's the little things that count 

I don't wanna keep going but you get the idea ,theres really an infinite amount of things you can do . But eventually I hope you focus on you, because setting yourself up for success is the #1 thing you need to do no matter what . Also find what brings you joy or happiness and make it a point to incorporate that into your life even if it's for 5-10 minutes a day . Fight for your sanity .

I also think having a mental illness doesn't disqualify you from being a good parent cause they are good parents out there that take loads of meds and their kids turn out fine .  Its the ones in denial or the lazy  ones who wouldn't want to be held accountable in the first place that would be weeded out with this and that idea is cool. If they can do it for adoptions they can implement it mandatory for all parents to get tested, have a parenting plan showing how theyll provide for the kid and parenting class courses with tests ,history of mental and criminal records ect and give all kids a fighting chance....."
