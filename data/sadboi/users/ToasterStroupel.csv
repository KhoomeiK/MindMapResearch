news,fqgoc1a,t1_fqg4akh,1589351930.0,"There’s more affecting this situation than just racism. Some people are talking about police brutality, also a main theme in the article, but others are gatekeeping that if you’re white it’s not about racism so it’s not relevant. It’s possible our main conflict is that everyone is arguing about two different subjects, but invalidating people dealing with the same root  issue in a different wrapping paper sounds like a good way to cause more conflict and slow progress. 

Tunnel vision is common when people are busy arguing, so let’s remember that we shouldn’t be fighting with each other, but with the ones taking advantage of us. Let’s agree that any cop taking advantage of his position to enforce his/her own agenda and prejudices should be held properly accountable no matter who he’s supposed to be “serving”. Laws need to be passed so that outright murders like this can never happen again. Do we really want to limit who’s fighting with us?"

ptsd,fnne6j6,t1_fnm57hp,1587090313.0,I think the adrenaline just gives us a lot of physical symptoms to go with our emotions.
raisedbynarcissists,fnm3stf,t1_fnlh6is,1587064599.0,"Journaling can help with getting your feelings into words. The bonus being that the better you get at wording those emotions and thoughts to a nonjudgemental piece of paper, the easier it will be to word them to another person because you’ll have already learned what feels right and what doesn’t work. Sounds like you’re on your way with the texting! Is there something else holding you back? What is your inner critic telling you when you’re sitting there in pain trying to express it to the other person in the room? 

I started crying again by forcing myself to sit with my feelings and purposely *trying* to grab the emotion and cry. I would know I needed to because I could feel it stuck in my chest but there was always a block to being able to access it, so I just didn’t for years and years. 

I was treated like I was just manipulating others for attention if I broke down as a kid, so sitting there trying to *make* myself cry when I had the option to stay numb made me feel like a phony. A big part of the process was just challenging all the negative, angry beliefs I have around the act and learning a healthier, more realistic way of looking at it so that I could give myself permission to do what I needed to. We internalize the abuse we grew up with and it becomes our inner critic. I had to keep asking mine just who I was faking all of this for to get attention from if I was the only one who knew what I was doing. 

And it feels overwhelming at first. It feels like feeling all of that emotion is breaking you, like maybe it’ll never stop coming, but that’s because we’re not used to feeling it. Just let it move through you like water through a sieve. Every skill takes practice, and being numb doesn’t help resolve the issue so it’ll never really go away if you don’t feel it. Little steps. Little victories. Be nice to yourself and just keep trying.

Edit: If you’d like I can go over some grounding skills with you to help you walk yourself back if you feel the emotions are too much. Do you meditate? It also helps to have a crisis number nearby. When I was learning to cry again I was dealing with trauma too so, while the emotion won’t hurt you and you can rest easy knowing that opening the flood gates will be beneficial in the long run, I know how trauma reminders can trigger some of us and we’re not always safe in that state. You know you best, but having a plan just in case things escalate would be wise. 

If you’re reading this feel free to PM me. I know some stuff, and when I don’t, I’ll tell you that too."

raisedbynarcissists,fnkluva,t3_g2aqdr,1587032033.0,My dad used to hit me until I stopped crying. He wasn’t malicious. He just didn’t have empathy for me as a scared kid. I sometimes couldn’t cry growing up and I had to force myself to relearn how to as an adult. I’ve met people who don’t think they can reach those emotions anymore. Don’t let them get too far out of reach. You often can’t fix the problem if you can’t feel it.

Then I called him on his shit (*”Chefsname, why can’t I do anything right for you?” “I don’t know. Why can’t you?”*), told him what I needed to, hung up my apron and laughed at him when he said, *”Ya, you go home and think about it. Come in tomorrow and we’ll talk about it.”* You wish.
