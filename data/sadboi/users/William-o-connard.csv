I don‚Äôt care, I don‚Äôt judge, postponing that task to a future me. I have tried to journal on computers many times but it never turned out as effective as plain paper. I am always trying to slow myself down, and to relax my wrist and fingers. I think the key to progress is to avoid boredom. You don‚Äôt like copying texts ? Don‚Äôt do it. You don‚Äôt like handwriting exercises? Skip them. But keep writing. Allowing myself to really slow down and relax is something I have to keep in mind ‚Äî but that‚Äôs just me. And allow yourself space for it. Don‚Äôt plan it. That‚Äôs bullshit. Don‚Äôt think ‚ÄúI am going to practice my handwriting x hours each and every day‚Äù. Never worked for me.

While pregnant my mother tried to commit suicide several times. I think I am still wearing those scars although my great efforts to get over it. My mom is a narcissist. She made it hard for me during my childhood. I left home as soon as I could. Had to work early in life. Can‚Äôt remember a worry-free time. I don‚Äôt have any solution or magic pill to recommend.
