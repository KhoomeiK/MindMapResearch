Have you tried the grey rock method? It's a way to set boundaries with narcissists when you don't have the option to go completely no contact with them.

I've found that it's particularly effective for covert narcs.  
Basically narcissists function to upset and confuse you, delaying effective communication and making you look like that bad guy when you get angry.

When you grey rock you remove all your emotional response and calmly control your facial expression, body movements, and responses to their tactics. It might help you break through her crying tactic and move onto something actually productive.

Not all narcissists are hopeless but jesus christ they can be annoying to communicate with

For something like album art that might go on posters one day you really want a nice big high quality file but it's also not absolutely necessary .. depends on what you want.

If you fall in love with an image that's too small, or too pixelated you can work with it. You won't get anything amazing and crisp and huge but there are things you can do to work with the low quality and make it more artistic

I believe that before I ask for anything that I should have the answers to any questions that might come up.   
I try to use logical reasoning when making a request and I'm always prepared for a no response before asking.

when there's a situation like you're having with the table I probably would've been much more casual when pointing out how similar the prices were.. more like;

'maybe after we save up for the blinds we could save for a new table? They're pretty much the same price'

asking this way doesn't include an accusation, it's not urgent and it's posed as a question he can still say no to.  
when you're negotiating the most important part is how you compromise.  
going into negotiate you sort of accept that you're not going to get everything you want, and neither is your partner so you're both going to feel kind of weird about it. The goal is to balance the give and take until you both feel okay about it  
has he ever said what a reasonable price for a new table would be? or when he wants to replace it? Is there some sort of emotional attachment to the table?

One last piece of advice I have regarding negotiation.. timing. Ask when you're both in a good emotional state, external stress is minimal etc."
