It also said you could try putting a bandaid on the finger you usually touch your face with and it'll help to make you more conscious of when you're doing it because you can feel the bandaid.

A coach bus full of seniors came in to eat on their way to the casino so my entire section was full. One of the older men in my section finished eating his food, went to go get himself a big bowl of soft serve ice cream, sits down, vomits all over the table, booth, and himself. I panic, give him a hefty stack of napkins and go tell the owner that I don't know what to do and I will also barf if I have to clean it up. He tells me to go do something else and the man from the table finally comes back out of the washroom after a solid ten minutes and what does he do?? Proceeds to eat his mostly melted soft serve ice cream. The vision of this is burned into my memory and I hope one day I will forget it.
