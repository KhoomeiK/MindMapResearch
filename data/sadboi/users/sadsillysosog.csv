You are valid, you do deserve help and you most certainly are allowed to be exhausted, you’re unwell with a illness - and that’s hard, but it means you need to give yourself some slack - some compassion that you show others to yourself, you need to be aware you’re allowed to take each day slowly and you deserve some empathy from others too :3

Such a strong cookie for getting this far! <3 

How is today going?"
SuicideWatch,fcwmt3v,t1_fcuujxy,1578030090.0,"Not OP, but I think for me, I’ve been trying to stay alive to maybe support suicidal people or to empathise with them. 

Or maybe it’s just the guilt holding me back from overdosing I don’t know anymore lol.

The fact i feel this bad means I can maybe help people with the empathy and knowledge of how hard it is.
Many people I’ve spoken to have gotten better.

Biggest example I can give, 1 year ago, a 16 year old was going to jump on New Year’s Eve. I spoke with them for a few hours until they went away from the edge.

They are now happy.

I think it not getting better doesn’t mean I can’t make it better for someone else.

Not to say you should suffer in the hopes of helping others. It’s just my personal perspective and I don’t know how much longer I’ll stick around, but I’m trying to make it a little better for others until it happens. :3
