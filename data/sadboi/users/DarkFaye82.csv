Anxiety,fmrgksr,t1_fmpa98q,1586322573.0,I started taking meds for my anxiety and realised that imagining the worst case scenario all the time was a symptom and not my personality. It blew me away that I never thought to mention to anyone that I thought I was going to crash every time I got into a car or fall down the stairs everytime I brought laundry up. I thought it was normal till it stopped happening.

AskAnAmerican,fk8myfn,t3_fgwmbu,1583959110.0,"I feel like in America, it's more what you see rather than where you go.  I live right in the middle of the country and everything is flat. Unless I see mountains, desert, swamp or ocean it doesn't feel like traveling."
AnimalCrossing,fjgw4z9,t3_fdd3is,1583336701.0,Amazing! Thank you!
AnimalCrossing,fiy8mm7,t3_faglo6,1582834679.0,Boyfriend is happy that he won't have to be worried that I'm bored while he plays COD.  Next month I can hang out with him and play my own game and we can both have a great time.
AnimalCrossing,fi1ujue,t3_f5tgaj,1582065069.0,I will play with you too!
insaneparents,fgmicll,t1_fgmaorm,1580925160.0,"I agree. I just told my 12 year old that if she missed the bus i would make her walk to school today because I get her up an hour before she needs to leave the house, I remind her multiple times that she needs to get a move on. But I also need to get ready in the morning and she is old enough to, with guidance, make sure she gets out on time. Not an awful punishment but trashy to put it online."

Anxiety,f4wok57,t3_dluq5r,1571858367.0,"Anxiety lies to us. I am currently overthinking everything my bf says and does and questioning if he really enjoys being with me or if its just easy. I keep trying to remind myself that anxiety lies to us and tells us the worst case scenario. Don't listen to your brain, pay attention to his actions. He will show you how he feels though them.  Breathe babe and know that he's still there for a reason."
Anxiety,f4wli1p,t3_dm09qt,1571857397.0,Big hugs. I'm about to blast some guilty pleasure music to get my self up and moving cause I feel like I'm in quick sand. Do you have any suggestions? What songs bring out your happy?
AmItheAsshole,f0otnf1,t3_d5qhn6,1568819983.0,NTA There is a big difference between a meat eater cooking vegan food and a vegan cooking meat.  I once made a vegan thanksgiving for a guy I dated but I don't have a problem touching or tasting vegetable and wheat germ.  I would have never expected him to cook meat for me.

Conservative,etmyefh,t1_etmvy7f,1562971765.0,"You're absolutely right, the faith of the business owner should have no bearing over the level of outrage."
Conservative,etmw6ol,t1_etmpdzt,1562970112.0,Maybe I misinterpreted your comment but I took it to mean that you believe that the couple in question should not have been upset for not recieving the same services that their straight counterparts would have received. The comment you were replying to stated that the user believed that they fight to be treated the same as their fellow man.  I was pointing out that the bakery situation is something that a straight couple would likely never encounter and as such is an exact example of not being treated the same.
Conservative,etmo1oi,t1_etmhgbx,1562964370.0,But how many straight people ever have to be told that a bakery won't make them a cake?

AskMen,es6lxa1,t3_c628kl,1561652268.0,I'm 36 and have only realized in the last few years that men aren't just naturally comfortable in stressful situations. I was driving in a blizzard and thought wow I wish my boyfriend was here to drive.  Realized that I've driven in just as many snow storms as he has and if I'm freaked and stressed out then he probably would be too.  No man ever told me that so I didn't know.  I try to be more understanding now.
