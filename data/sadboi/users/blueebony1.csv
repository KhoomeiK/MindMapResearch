depression,fjk8us2,t3_fdvaj2,1583422534.0,"I'm in the exact same boat as you - always looking back and struggling to move on. One of my biggest fears is that if I don't keep the memories alive in my head all the time, nobody else will remember and then it'll be like they never happened. 

I would really recommend reaching out to people from those good times - I did this recently with one friend and they were really happy to hear from me! It's not going to be the same as it was, but it's nice to share your memories with someone who was there and appreciates those times too :)"
depression,fhuduq6,t3_f4re4h,1581885263.0,"Me too - but if I could, I'd go a step further and go back to the beginning of my life. There's so much I would do differently and the regrets are tearing me apart at the moment."
UnsentLetters,ffncuaf,t3_eu5eqk,1580064397.0,Just beautiful.
mentalhealth,ff0c3k6,t3_equkm4,1579467498.0,You have no idea how much I needed to hear this - thank you so much.
depression,fdngb7o,t1_fdhad9j,1578585195.0,"Thank you, you don't know how much it helps to know someone actually cares."
depression,fco3cta,t3_ei1phe,1577823301.0,"I don't want to die but I just don't see happiness in my future. My hope is that I can get a job that lets me buy a property far away (ideally in the wilderness, but the countryside will do). I'm done pretending to be super social and happy when inside I die a little every day. I get my expectations up and I am literally always disappointed, I can't take it anymore."
depression,fc5eh6g,t3_egacg2,1577455180.0,"I'm really sorry to hear this :( If you ever feel like a chat, please send me a private message."
depression,fc5eajp,t3_eg7ris,1577455014.0,"I'm literally in the same boat as you - right now, I've been sitting at home for the last few hours when I was meant to go to the gym this morning. Well, this is what I'm going to do and I thought maybe sharing it with you might help! I'm going to go for a run (couple of miles probably before it gets dark) and then do a couple of home work-out videos. I find home work-out videos where I can control how fast I do the exercises and when I take breaks, are pretty helpful :) Plus, I find it impossible to do anything in the gym apart from the treadmill because it's the only thing I'm mildly good at lol"
depression,fc5dj7t,t3_eg8v99,1577454302.0,"Me too, but I feel like just trying to re-create the past makes me even more depressed. I guess it's that feeling of knowing that whatever I try to do now, it'll never be the same as it was back then."
depression,fc5d2rf,t1_fc1qbt5,1577453856.0,"Yeah, I try to talk to my family but it's so difficult as they're all facing their own challenges and I just don't feel like it would help at all to offload my troubles onto them. I would usually talk to my best friend about this but we've fallen out so right now I'm feeling pretty isolated. All I want is a better 2020 where I can find a bit of happiness for myself. Thank you for the advice though"
depression,fbxslky,t3_ef11v6,1577199386.0,"Christmas is quite possibly the worst time of year for me. I won't be alone but my problem is that recent Christmasses don't live up to anything near the experience I used to have (I think the last great christmas I had was in 2012). Maybe this is to do with growing up and being an adult, but damn I miss the magic and sparkle that Christmas used to have when I was younger. I couldn't wait to jump out of bed on Christmas Eve and do a last minute christmas dash, versus this year where I have literally just been in my room all day doing absolutely nothing. 

I'm sending you hugs and I hope next year is better for you."
depression,fbajia3,t1_fbaix5d,1576679801.0,"Yeah that's something I always try to keep in mind because I know there are people out there with way worse problems than me and I'm just being selfish trying to bother God, but it's hard sometimes. 

I want to take control of my life but honestly I'm just terrified that I'm not good enough for anything/anyone. I pretty much have no idea what I'm doing/what I want and just feel directionless. 

But I really appreciate your words, thank you :)"
depression,f9rpb3y,t1_f9rnyrq,1575579420.0,I know! I wish there was a way to slow time down - it's hard to really make the most of the day and appreciate it when it's rushing by so fast and over so soon.
Allergies,f9pmis1,t1_f9mrjpb,1575542303.0,"Okay, thanks for the advice! I'm feeling better but it's good to know for any future mishaps"
depression,f9mj6cn,t3_e5rclq,1575461287.0,"This is so true, I've never thought about it this way! Sometimes, I even think people are going out of their way to mess me about, but then all they do is smile or say ""hi"" and I just feel ridiculous"
Allergies,f9miwhi,t1_f9mim9c,1575460967.0,"Okay, will do! Thanks for the advice."
depression,f9kv2ae,t1_f9klcbb,1575408447.0,"Yeah, that too. Okay no worries, I totally respect your privacy - if you're not okay with it, then I won't!"
depression,f9kkmyg,t1_f9kk0po,1575402404.0,No worries! Hope you have a great day dude
depression,f9kjwed,t1_f9kjbhv,1575401974.0,"For me, it's not random but it's almost like some crazy subconscious thing that I do where I'm aware of it but I'm always too late to stop myself from doing it"
depression,f9kjrbn,t1_f9kj54r,1575401893.0,"Yeah, I'm definitely going to try to! Thanks :)"
depression,f9kiydr,t1_f9kif8w,1575401417.0,"I'm sorry to hear that too. I wish I could offer you some advice but I honestly don't know how to stop.

It's so weird though, I don't think I'm more stressed/depressed than I usually am, so I don't know why this is happening."
depression,f9khp3d,t3_e5i6vs,1575400676.0,Exactly me! Don't know about you but Christmas Eve is way better than Christmas Day for me these days because at least I can pretend that things will be amazing the next day
depression,f9khhaa,t3_e5lu21,1575400546.0,"They sound like awful friends dude, I'm really sorry :( Well I for one want to wish you happy birthday! As for things to do, don't know if this is your thing but if it was me, I'd find somewhere that plays some good jazz and go and get a table in a corner and chill out :)"
depression,f9kgild,t3_e5lpua,1575399972.0,"I have this as well! But the worst thing is when you actually meet their gaze and they quickly look away and it just makes you question whether you're going crazy :(

Is your youtube channel under your reddit name? I'd love to check it out!"
depression,f9kg0d0,t1_f9kfh19,1575399666.0,"Ah dude, I can honestly relate - there is literally no way out of that situation without making it super awkward. The struggle is too real and it sucks"
AskReddit,f9kf2uh,t1_f9kc3mu,1575399109.0,"Just jumping on the Gladiator bandwagon haha but ""Shadows and dust, Maximus. Shadows and dust"""
timetravel,f969wm1,t1_f95zh8z,1575141901.0,"Okay, I'll keep that in mind - thanks again for letting me know"
timetravel,f95ytt3,t1_f937lu0,1575137307.0,"Yeah, I definitely think teleportation is possible! But I'm not sure if it's something we'll ever be able to totally control to be honest"
timetravel,f95yb96,t1_f93m4tc,1575137175.0,I didn't even consider that - thanks for bringing that possibility to my attention! Do you know if this sort of experience is a common symptom?
timetravel,f92c4eq,t1_f90hzcv,1575023402.0,Wow that sounds super intense - how long did it last? I think it would be so cool if it was something we could control and use to go to specific places!
mentalhealth,f73ujsr,t1_f6x9xzt,1573395274.0,"Thank you for the advice :) Yeah, I also struggle with constant handwashing but I like the attitude you have towards it now. I guess the exposure does sort of build up your system! Do you mind me asking whether you've completely recovered? Do you still struggle with the fear sometimes? I'd love to think there's a light at the end of this very long tunnel."
self,f6w3gbw,t3_dtaxd4,1573214902.0,"Well, I for one want to wish you a great day! I've been in your shoes and it sucks to think that birthdays become less special the older you get, but you know what, I've realised that the only person you need to have a great day (whether it's your birthday or just an ordinary day) is you! Do not let this day depend on other people - this day is totally about giving yourself some love :)"
depression,f6tm1jm,t1_f6taiy3,1573150934.0,"Yeah and I feel like everyone is getting on with their lives and they don't want to talk about the past. I sometimes think that if I didn't text/call anyone it would be like I didn't exist, nobody would go out of their way to make sure I was okay. I just have the opinion now that there's no point really putting effort into friendships because people are just going to come in and out of my life."
depression,f6t9n1j,t1_f6sz3jp,1573145881.0,Have you made friends since then though? I feel like the friendships I have now aren't as genuine as they were back then
depression,f6sytpl,t1_f6sx4if,1573141625.0,"I'm so sorry about your parents :(

I can relate to missing my friends though, I've lost touch with so many people that used to be a huge part of my life and now it's just like there's a void."
depression,f6swq7l,t1_f6stwxp,1573140822.0,"I'm glad I'm not the only one! And it sucks because I spend so much time thinking about how far away it is and being sad that I can't go back that I've missed out on life pretty much the last eight years (even saying it's been 8 years since 2012 makes me feel so down) 

Well here's hoping they invent a time machine soon I guess"
depression,f6pz05t,t3_dskshb,1573067379.0,This is literally me most of the time! I feel like I can handle people and interacting but only on my terms and in small doses. I've also been pretty anti-touching/hugging/physical contact for a while now too but it's literally impossible to avoid unfortunately
