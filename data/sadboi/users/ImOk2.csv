depression,exdcxvs,t3_cs2ogj,1566173302.0,You are so fortunate. Some of us don't have that.  But how beautiful to have discovered that you are loved.  Sounds like you have too much to lose.

But I'm the black sheep so they won't even know when God takes my life.
And that's ok.  No bother with concerns at this point.  For me it's the physical pain that trumps my feeling of loss.  The exhaustion from not living or having good enough reason to fight it when nothing feels real in the first place. And I care so little about myself that my heart is going out to you.
The young and beautiful.  Family is who you make it.  Sometimes it is healthier to let them go.  Time now to heal you."

Thanks for sharing."
