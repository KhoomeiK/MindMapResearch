lupus,fcj5wb2,t3_ehfq3e,1577678041.0,"Another 20 year old here! I’ve been struggling with Lupus for almost 2 years now. I know how hard it can be and for people not to believe your pain or understand how hard it can be to be so young but to be sick with a disease that never goes away. People think just because you often look perfectly fine that you must feel and be healthy but that’s not true. I’m at a place in my journey with lupus where I am pretty stable, I take plaquenil and my symptoms have remained pretty minimal since. I’m in my third year of college and am trying to keep positive. Just wanted to let you know that you aren’t alone and that in the end things will work out okay. We will be okay. Thinking of you in your struggle. Wishing you all the best."
college,exysmb1,t3_cutd8w,1566656401.0,Hey there! I’m technically a freshman as well (transferred to a new school from CC) and I have barely been able to eat these past few days after I moved in. I’m hoping this subsides once classes start and school picks up but just wanted to say I’m feeling the same!
college,exa882z,t3_crszuh,1566101673.0,"Hey there, just wanted to let you know I’m feeling the exact same way. I move into my dorm on Monday and I’m feeling very stressed and overwhelmed. Like you mentioned I’m really scared of the aspect of my life never being the same as it is now. I’m scared to leave my home and family for the first time. I don’t really know what to expect but from what I’ve read it will be okay and we will eventually adjust to our new life at college. Good luck with your first semester!!"
OCD,evqsw5n,t1_evqqvz7,1564696902.0,"Haha I would definitely do that, but another thing why this is so dumb to be worried about is that our office is closed for the week besides a few people in and out so there will be nobody around, which confirms again why this is so silly to be worrying about ugh lol, but thank you for the help I appreciate it!"
Anxiety,euo6ulr,t3_ch08i6,1563937973.0,"Yup!!!! Going through this right now, even seems to be bad going back after weekends. I feel like I can’t even enjoy my time off work because I’m worried about having to go back. Wishing you the best with this struggle. We will get through it!"
Anxiety,eu1x8aq,t3_ced3nz,1563377550.0,Congratulations!! This inspired me to not give up on my driving struggles! So happy for you!!
HealthAnxiety,etu57cb,t3_cdghap,1563204540.0,"Hey there, so sorry you are having to go through this. I know what it’s like to have people not believe you, but I’m glad you found someone who did. I have very bad health anxiety, and I myself was actually diagnosed with Lupus a little over a year ago. I just wanted to let you know that even if you end up getting diagnosed with it, it is a very manageable condition, and things will be okay. I wish you all the best."
Anxiety,et8e8ew,t3_caebtx,1562554053.0,Just wanted to say I relate to this so much. I had a near panic attack last week at work and had to leave and now my anxiety has been the worst it’s been in my life ever since. Usually I could get through my days okay but it’s getting harder and I’m anxious all the time. I am wishing you all the best in your struggles. We will get through this.
Anxiety,esmom5l,t3_c8gayd,1562110634.0,Congratulations!!
