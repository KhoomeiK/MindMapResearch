AskReddit,fr4vre6,t3_gmoquc,1589897804.0,"Type one diabetic here, diagnosed 2010.

I use an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The pump keeps a 'constant' flow of insulin (one drop every three seconds) and kind of acts as a pancreas would with secreting insulin. The CGM allows me to monitor my blood glucose with 5 minute updates and has helped me get my a1c (consider it a rating of your average blood sugar) under control. 

I tend to be hyperglycemic (average bg for me is 201, slowly getting that down) and I, for the most part, try to limit my intake to 100 carbs, keeping a high protein diet. I *can* eat lots of sugar, but I'd have to take a lot of insulin.

For me, when my bg gets high, it's normally a headache, I feel dehydrated, and my body sends liquids through me faster than the autobahn. I've only been severely high once, didn't have major problems, but I did end up at my doctor and that was what got me diagnosed.

When my bg is averaging higher than normal it gets difficult to focus my eyes on anything in particular, and it's almost like I have ADHD.

My low BG symptoms are shaking, irritability, sweating, and I'll eat the entire kitchen if I don't stop myself.

I've had two severe lows (bg was <40), one I covered with half a jug of fruit juice, the other my father injected me with glucagon in the middle of the night. Google glucagon, it's a big ass needle."
