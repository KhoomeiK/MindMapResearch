Since you decided to cherry pick my posts you opted to ignore the comments that said my sister is CF and that my daughter who idolizes her has indicated she never wants kids. 

It actually is because I have learned so much from this sub that I choose to read it and occasionally comment on it. 

And the reason I finally got up the nerve to ask/comment about this topic is because I am genuinely curious. Mother’s Day posts happen yearly here. I know you’re aware of this, but I have been reading here for years. And so I am aware that people don’t always react kindly to people they disagree with. Nothing in my original post mentioned my own child status. It was irrelevant to the discussion. I can ask a Libertarian questions about their political beliefs without mentioning my own if I am trying to learn something. 

I began my post my saying someone could correct me and comment on my thoughts. You seem to have gotten very offended that I dare to post anything here. And to answer your question; yes. I have seen cf comment on parenting boards. Just because you haven’t doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. 

I will agree it got a little long. I even indicated the SIP order has given me too much time on my hands. 

You have done nothing but attack my wording and perceived intentions/motivations. You can give no evidence to how I shit on motherly love for pets or plants other than your own twisted interpretations of what I said. When I say different that does not mean less than. 

I can see you do not value discussion only insults, and have too much baggage to see past your own bias. If anyone is judging in this exchange, it’s been you."

And unless you can give me an example of how love for different people isn’t different, I stand by that claim. 

I don’t disagree at all that some people care more for their pets than some humans do for their children. Did I say or imply otherwise? 

I will have to consider your idea of “nurturing love”, so thanks for actually adding something useful to my thought process. 

You seem very upset that I have a child and felt the need to comment on my post history instead of the merits of what I said. You decided to tell everyone I am a teacher and so that could also imply I like to think about people and ideas. I’m sorry if sub is unable to be nothing but a Mother’s Day wishing sub. 

It’s too bad you aren’t able to extend me the same curtesy you wish to be extended, which is not to be judged based upon your decision to have children. Although that is an assumption, maybe I’m wrong."
childfree,fq68afi,t3_gh0oio,1589126505.0,"So I think I have finally wrapped my head around this idea, and feel free to correct me. 

I have never understood this idea of being CF and then choosing to call yourself a mother. I agree that mothering can take different forms: an auntie/uncle or adoptive/step or that woman who you look up to as a mother figure. 

But the notion of being a mother to plants seems crazy to me. Even how wrapped up people get about defending their right to be called mom to their pets. 

And so I try to understand it. 

Many CF women, especially, feel marginalized by society because their choices are not viewed as mainstream. People don’t understand how you can not have that mothering desire and sometimes make you feel less then. 

When you say you are a non-human’s mother is it a way of trying to put your feelings into a perspective/language understood by the majority? You believe you feel for that pet what a mom feels for their child. You believe you care for that pet the way a mom cares for their child. And so, you use a language that everyone understands.  You say they’re your child and you’re their mom. Because people understand that relationship. 

Because let’s be factual for a moment. They are not the same. And that’s perfectly ok. Love/relationships/responsibilities are not all the same. Spousal love is not the same as parental love is the not same as bff love is not the same as parental love is not the same as sibling love is not the same as pet love. That’s what makes love beautiful; it doesn’t have to be the same.  It just has to be. 

Anyway. I clearly have too much time on my hands during this quarantine. I have just never understood why CF people would get so wrapped up in Mother’s Day as it seems counterintuitive. Doesn’t really happen as much at Father’s Day and I think it has something to do with societal expectations. And that is a topic I enjoy trying to dissect. 

Please believe I am not trying to judge, merely understand and engage. Ultimately you can call yourself whatever you want, it shouldn’t matter. Just like deciding not to have children shouldn’t matter."
