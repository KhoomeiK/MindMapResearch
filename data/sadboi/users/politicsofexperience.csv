Which frame are you canibalizing, and which are you keeping? Or are you undecided?   I think it sounds like you are keeping the big honzo and making it commuter friendly.  

Unless your flatbar bike is boost (or your Kona mtb isn’t), I don’t see how you would get the 22.5mm rims over (short of swapping hubs, and that sounds pricey either way).  

If you have it figured out good on you, but if you don’t you might just consider the slickest tires that will fit the 40mm rim, and run them at higher pressure. 

As for the gearing.  I rode on my hybrid mtb in the hills a lot, and I found that carrying momentum into the next hill could make a series of hills a breeze. However, if you are stuck with a small ring because of the boost spacing, not much you can do other than a 10t or 9t.  Imo that sounds expensive for commuting. Especially if the majority of the time you will be trying to squeeze out speed on a 9t or 10t cog (or even an 11t).  On every cassete I ever owned I wore through the small cogs first.

I think it was capped at like $800 and had all kinds of stipulations. I even considered having some professionals pack it for me to be able to point my finger if it did get damaged, but that didn’t even seem like it would’ve mattered.  

I suppose shippers are super skeptical since it seems like bike damage can get really expensive quick, and on top of being really easy to do, it could be fraud prone.  For instance say you damage a carbon frame, what’s to keep you from putting it in a box, paying for shipping and insurance, then claiming on the other end that it was damaged in shipping. At least that’s what came to mind when I started to wonder why on earth I couldn’t get good insurance for shipping my bike back to the dealer.

Side note:
I ordered a Giant recently and they can only be shipped to dealers....guess it surprised the dealer since most people come in and they order.  They said the box was upside down, battered, and falling apart when it came off the truck.  There was a significant amount of damage, and the shipper had to pay for it, but from the way the bike shop treated me, it seemed like the shipper wouldn’t or didn’t.

Whether or not he is following through with honesty is another story, and it’s really sad if he isn’t.  Doing back of the envelope preliminary tests are fine, so long as it is informing improvements in the direction of publishable quality, and he isn’t abandoning the process because it isn’t telling you him what he wants to hear.  In fact a scientist is supposed to rigorously try to disprove something, not prove it, it’s inabiliy to be disproven is what stands.

Contrary to popular belief, scientist will nitpick the shit out of each other’s experimental designs, and they may get all the way to publishing while still disagreeing."

I’d be less concerned about aerodynamics on something like the ghost lector 8.9, and more concerned about its stock tallest gear ratio being 3.2.  Compared to a hybrid mtb that has a stock top gear ratio of 4.36, it is gonna be pretty uncomfortable making up that speed with higher rpm."
MTB,exre4mi,t1_exntgas,1566515254.0,"I think that’s a fantastic tire for the rear tire, ran it that way for years.  However if I knew I was going to a gnarly area, I would often switch to a full knobby.  Basically if you find yourself in some rough stuff it will suffice.  

You wouldn’t want it as a front tire though. There are tons of options for the front that are fast..here is an example https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/maxxis-pace-mtb-tyre-exo-tr/rp-prod158901"

At that price range I might even consider a second set of wheels, and depending on group set, may even set up the rear for the road with taller gearing."

bicycling,exo3eey,t3_ctu69z,1566469028.0,"My first real bike I rode for 5 years, rain, sleet, or snow....it always lived outside.  I never intentionally washed it, but I would clean it up a little when I wanted to give it a service and didn’t want to be embarrassed by how dirty it was, or if it ever was acting up such that I thought I needed to do...usually when it struggled to shift.

This is what I suggest:

Hose it down, grab a can of wd 40 and a rag, flip it over and while you backpedal spray the chain while grabbing the chain with different part of the rag until the rag doesn’t run black anymore.  Give a couple squirts into the rear cassette and jockey wheels, then run through all your gears front and back while still holding the rag over the chain.  

Then wipe down you rear derailer.  Move it through the range of motion with your hand, and inspect it for anything that looking rusty. If you find the rusty stuff (usually the spring) spray it and try to clean it by dabbing it into the housing.  It may take a couple squirts and wipes. 

You can then use the same oily rag to finish drying the underside of the bike and other parts or brackets down there you might suspect are rusty.  Inspect for cracks or gouges in the paint, and bolts holding on parts that look sketch. Don’t mess with correcting them but take mental notes. If you see anything rusty squirt it, wipe it, and hit any rusty spots on the frame with a little smooth sandpaper.  If your really feeling ambitious get some nail polish that matches and cover any exposed metal or gouges on the frame.  If you have any cracks, do not cover them with the nail polish, just take note of there location and size...take a picture with a ruler if you want. Keep all the messed up stuff in mind for the next time you talk to a mechanic.

I would also tighten my brake cables when I did this, if you run out of barrel adjuster play you can usually tighten the cable a few times before they are truly spent.  Nowadays I am mostly hydraulic so it’s a bit more involved.  

I would imagine that over those years of daily riding near and far I only replaced 3 chains, 2 rear cassettes, 2 sets of cables, a big chain ring, 2 sets of brake pads, and one rear derailer.  That is about a penny and a half a mile.  

I never really understood people who kept their bikes super clean...mine was an outside dog and it loved me anyways.

It was only valued at $100 bucks when someone ripped a post out of the ground to steal it, but I still dream about it.  If one could ever really truly love a machine. I loved that bike."
bikewrench,exns90w,t3_ctk8r6,1566462679.0,"Did you replace the tube or patch it?

I would pop off the tire, grab a piece of sandpaper and go hunting for burs.  First clean the inside of the rim, then gently run your hand to see if you can feel anything sharp or jagged.  If something is real gnarly you might try super glueing a small rubber boot (you can use an old tube if you didn’t toss em) over it so long as it doesn’t interfere where the tire bead meets the rim."
