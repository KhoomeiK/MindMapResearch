However, that notion of passing is also completely defined by stereotypical attire and behaviour for the sex the person wants to pass as. So yeah. Itâ€™s gender conformist. Nobody ever says you can feel/ look/ behave however you want and still be your birth sex and that your birth sex does not define your personality (as I guess you would call it, your gender).
