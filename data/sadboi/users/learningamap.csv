In your case it seems as though you feel you do not have the power to end the conversation leading you to feel the other person is in control. Getting in touch with your innate strength, and how it applies to decision making might be something to look into :)"

It actually may be the thing that keeps them from going down a rabbit hole of worse anxiety, even including those who joke about it, they're taking away it's power by associating humor with it. Now I know many aren't cognitively understanding it as something they do, but it might be the coping mechanism that keeps away from a serious anxiety driven life. Just a thought :)"
