Video game design and development is such a massive topic that a single human lifetime is not nearly long enough for that. And anyone who'd even say that is, frankly, full of shit.

We don't really come up with fully original ideas often, if ever. We can't help but live in this world, surrounded by ideas and concepts and all the rest. Try as you might, there is no way you can avoid influences. It's pointless. Instead, you should aim to be influenced by the best thinking you can get your hands on. That means going out of your way to find those rare, powerful lessons that elevate you as a game maker.

Please don't do yourself the disservice of shutting yourself into a dark room, merely _hoping_ you'll magically come up with something totally novel. Instead, go forth and educate yourself and put the work in. This means not just playing games, but playing them like a designer. If you do this, you *will* become better. Simple as that.

And redfaller, please don't mistake my passion for aggression. Life is too short and we all got better things to do than argue with strangers on the internet."

I always make sure to tell my design students that playing a wide variety of games increases your vocabulary and sophistication as a developer, leading you to make better games (or it at least helps you avoid mistakes already made by others - so you don't have to).

Please, don't feel guilty about this. It's an essential part of game development."

It won't teach you programming, per se, but it will help you learn creative problem solving and how to think like a developer (specially if you're new to this stuff). 

I'm fact, I like C3 so much that I included two weeks of it in this year's game design curriculum. Sure, it has its downsides (no folder-based saving, etc) like everything, but enabling me to prototype out a game mechanic in a manner of minutes is a huge plus.

Making games is difficult, but definitely learnable (if that's even a real word!). Whatever you end up with, just stick at it. Specially when it gets hard."

Happy game making!"

In any case, if you have a dream, go for it. Try to come up with a reasonable action plan, to your best abilities. Start small, see where it goes. With hard work, determination and maybe a bit of good luck, you might even surprise yourself.

Assuming you aren't a professional developer, go buy some books, read all you can find online (Gamasutra, etc), watch GDC talks on YouTube and take it from there. There's plenty of good advise to be found, if you're serious about this. 

And most importantly; don't stop when it gets hard and you realize how much work it actually is.

Although, by the numbers, it's not very likely you'll ""make it"", you might just be one of the ones who do. It happens all the time.

depression,euke149,t3_cglb3p,1563887027.0,"I know exactly how you feel. I was raised by a single mother from a really dysfunctional family (alcohol, violence, suicide, etc), so she didn't really have a lot of the tools necessary to raise a happy child. This, combined with my introverted temperament and my father overdosing when I was 8, made for quite a difficult childhood. Although I thankfully never hurt anyone else, I was a pretty self-destructive youth. I more or less wrecked my life because I just didn't respect myself enough to be good to myself.

Its not something I feel I can take any credit for, but I have realized how lucky (or not unlucky?) I was to not have my father's addictive personality. Although I drank and smoked from an early age, I never got deeply into drugs. I had my run ins with prescription pills and booze and shit like that, but I never managed to hurt myself permanently. When I was going through dark times as a young adult, I think having the experience of my dad ""abandoning"" me by killing himself with drugs probably helped me not slip over the edge.

Fast forward to 2019. I'm now a happily divorced 36 year old man with two wonderful, healthy kids. I live in my own apartment near my children's mother and all that stuff is going really well. I got lucky and found a great therapist who really helped me question my own depressed thinking. I've also been on the best medication I've ever tried for about two years now (Voxra, 300mg/day, extended release - really helps me not feel quite as tired).

It's taken me a long time to get here, but Im actually starting a new job as a full-time game design teacher in a month and I'm utterly terrified. Terrified and excited. I know this is my chance at financial independence, which feels like an impossible thing. And on top of everything, I really get to do something I care deeply about. You might even say I could be doing a lot worse. 

Anyway, I wasn't supposed to go on for this long. My main point is that even though you might feel like there's no way out and no one's ever going to accept and love you for who you are, it's totally possible. For you and for me. If it helps at all, there are a lot of people on this subreddit alone that have done it.

Hell, I still feel like an outsider 95% of the time, but now I've found out that I don't actually want to change. I've learned to draw so much strength from that outsider perspective. It's made me who I am today. Sure, it's not the easy route through life, but you kind of need something to push against if you want to grow into an excellent person. 

Think of all the exceptional people you look up to. Are they just blind followers who bring nothing new to the table? That there is not a piece of them in whatever they do? Of course not! Followers can't be leaders, and so forth.

Thing is, you don't need to become an insider to live a fulfilling life. I don't know you, but I suspect you might be one of us. One of the people who never fit in. People who crave deep connection. If this is the case, know that you are not alone.

AmItheAsshole,eu68c6o,t1_eu5zyxs,1563494417.0,"Well. The OP for sure has a choice here and I'd love to see it be something that amounts to the least amount of suffering to those who do not deserve it - while still being sane.

I'm glad your father's strategy worked out well for you. Having kids is definitely something people should only do after a long, hard think. Would you have been happy being kicked out of your home at 18 if you found yourself in a similar situation, I wonder. If I fucked up that bad - not once, but twice! - I'd wish my parents were there for me. There'd be ample opportunity for forgiveness and maybe even happiness after a while; something that's probably not on the cards for the family if the OP abandons his daughter and possibly even the grandchildren in this case. 

I mean, could the daughter not move in and some kind of an arrangement be reached where the parents aren't put under an awfully unfair amount of financial/emotional stress, while still giving the children the best chance for a happy and fulfilled life? Possibly. 

You also kind of sign up for dealing with your kid's stuff when you choose to make them, I feel. Up to a reasonable point, of course, which is a line everyone needs to draw on their own. This applies to both the daughter and the father."
AmItheAsshole,eu66kgw,t1_eu64xhk,1563493275.0,"Fully agreed on the latter part. I'm glad they teach that to kids in Canada. They do a similar thing here in Finland, although there's still room for improvement.

What I was mainly concerned was retroactively withdrawing consent. Can you do it a year after? Ten years? Why? I just can't see that ever working out to anyone's advantage.

If you and me had consensual sex and I lied to you about something, wouldn't it matter what it was? Or would any lie do? Why? 

As far as most western countries are concerned, I think legally speaking you consent to having sex, of which unwanted pregnancy is not that uncommon a consequence - even with proper birth control. That you, as an adult person who can give consent, are aware of these risks and still decide to go forward with it. People get unlucky all the time, but you can't really legislate against that. This is also pretty close to where I'm currently at, morally speaking. 

That being said, my instinct is that I wouldn't force the father to be legally responsible for the child if it can be shown deception happened. This might be impossible to do in real life, though. This does still happens to way too many dudes.

AmItheAsshole,eu61xxf,t1_eu5yhma,1563490368.0,"This is indeed a very interesting topic and something we, as human, should have a good, long discussion about it on an international level. 

What she did was obviously both immoral and illegal, as you pointed out, but is there no limits to withdrawing consent after the fact? I would imagine the sex that happened was consensual.

Maybe we should have a more accurate term for this? Maybe there already is, but I just don't know it. Reproductive coercion looks kinda close after a quick Google search on the phone.

I think there are definite questions we need to figure out if wanna talk about retroactively removing consent. For one, what counts as lying? Is it rape if I, for example, lie about my name or occupation to a partner and it turns out they would've not slept with me if they knew. What about age, as long as it's within the law? 

Can anyone choose to withdraw consent retroactively for whatever reason at any time? 

Rape is such serious thing (and a word) that I think we need to be extra careful when throwing it around. It's also a legal term with definite real world consequences, and it doesn't completely overlap with people's perceptions of what constitutes rape - which is a completely separate discussion in itself.

We need to be thoughtful when it comes to this stuff if our aim is to have an adult conversation on the topic."

Personally, as a father of a girl, I probably would take her back, just with some strict rules in place.

The children need and deserve a safe, loving environment, regardless of anything else.

Please, do not abandon you child because shes young and stupid. For one, our brains don't stop developing until we're around 25. Remember being a dumbass 19yo? Yeah.
