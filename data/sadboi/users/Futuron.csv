adhd_anxiety,fqjhk4x,t3_giz85z,1589410027.0," I have ADHD, Anxiety, Depression & childhood trauma all compacted into my 44 years. In most ways, I agree with what you said. I try hard, but in reality I suck at relationships (friends or otherwise). I have difficulty trusting anyone, even close friends. Little things that should be no big deal often feel like some monumental obstacle. I have very little patience anymore. I find that I isolate myself far more than I would be if I didn't have to go through all this. I stumble through keeping focus which has made jobs difficult. I certainly feel like I am lagging behind in life. I joke that if I could live to 500, I might eventually get my shit together enough to feel like I properly should at my current age.

 That being said, I find that in some strange way I am more resilient than the average person. I may not have patience with bullshit, but I have a strange tolerance about me. It could simply be that I just don't really have enough emotional capacity to care much about anything, or that being so overwhelmed caused me to just shut many things out. I have spent my whole life normalizing my mental health problems that a horrible day for the average person is just another Tuesday for me. My emotional growth was severely stunted as a child, but due to my upbringing my intuition to see potential outcomes and danger from a person or situation has been honed to a fine edge. 

Basically, I am fairly damaged goods, but I try to see as many positives in myself as I can. It helps knowing that I am not a complete screw up."

I find as an adult it just feels so greedy to use housing as an investment vehicle. Nobody should own more than 2 houses (I would say just 1, but my sister has a very small 'summer home' that is part of a very tiny community and is not really optimum to live in year round). If you can afford a second house for personal use only, I am for the most part fine with that. When it comes to apartments, those are a necessary evil, but I have noticed that local prices for most 2 bedroom apartments are over the cost of the mortgage of my average sized 4 bedroom house and almost as much if you include my property tax.

I average taking them maybe every other day. If I am extremely anxious, an edible will make it far worse.

While edibles do not fix any of the underlying problems from anxiety or depression, the mild high I get from them makes me feel happy and relaxed. I have gone through so many medications and so far most do not work for me or also have side effects which negates any positive effects.

depression,fm1kd5g,t1_fm1bpt7,1585680008.0,"Not really sure to be honest; my mental health is so different day to day as well as what it was 5 years ago; I am constantly having to change tactics. Until the past decade, I had no idea I actually had depression (as well as ADHD, anxiety, manic episodes, and PTSD from an abusive mother) so I just thought everyone had the same problems I do. After a serious suicide attempt in my early 20's, I developed this thing in my head where I just want to experience as much as I can out of life. It's part stubbornness and curiosity. I also like to do things just to see if I can do it. I think I got that creativity and problem solving from my grandmother since she was very much the same. There is a small part of me that can look at a project or a problem and can see all the steps I need to take to get it finished. I applied that way of thinking into my own life and that is probably the single biggest thing that has kept me going. I learned how to become very high functioning and even now my best friends have no idea how bad my mental health is. My wife knows I have issues, but she has no clue just how bad it is for me. I just keep pushing forward and try not to let my problems affect others. I can ""fake it 'til I make it"" better than most so if I keep putting a smile on my face, maybe it will feel natural someday...right? I used my creativity and troubleshooting skills to figure out all sorts of ways to 'fix myself'. I never stop pushing myself because I know that the moment I do, I will be dead. 

Anyway, it still feels so futile because I will never live long enough or have enough money to do all the things I want to. Existential anxiety and depression ended up developing as a counter to my optimistic push to normalcy. My life is one massive roller coaster and I realized I have become numb to so much. I really don't know what my future is going to be like because I have gone through so many medications and most don't work or work well enough, and those that do also have side effects that are generally far worse than the depression and anxiety itself. Therapy helped greatly, but after a few years it started having diminishing returns. For now, my cats are the biggest thing pushing me to keep on."

We are already mentally and physically exhausted from depression so the effort to push through and make those rare good days last a bit longer becomes work. Lots and lots of work. We are not addicted to depression, it's that it feels so very wrong that happiness means effort. Happiness is so against the grain for us, so draining, that we sink back into depression very easily.

If they could read my mind they would probably be very scared for me. 'Normal' people just don't understand what its like being depressed. Some things are only understood until its experienced so I found it pointless to talk about it. The stigma from mental illness is huge, but also nobody likes a complainer or a 'debbie downer' so it only makes sense that over my 40+ years of life I learned to just keep my mouth shut around those close to me. 

In some ways the fake it until you make it, has helped me. By constantly putting on a front of normalcy, it starts becoming a little more natural. The only issue is that my depression really doesn't go away either so I have two parts of me battling for control. Its frustrating and exhausting bouncing back and forth between long periods of feeling like garbage and a day or two (or just a few brief hours) of feeling somewhat normal. With effort (and definitely medication and therapy) it can get easier to handle. Don't give up.

I have read probably 2/3 of the novels, collected comic books, and bought toys and all sorts of stuff for a good chunk of my life. 

Since Disney came into the picture, my interest dwindled faster than I could have ever imagined. I thought Rogue 1 was decent and probably the best thing Disney has done. Solo was kinda meh with a backstory that was somewhat interesting but at the same time just felt really 'off' to me. Disney's trilogy just plain sucks and each movie fails individually for many different reasons and as a trilogy it is just a huge mess. I haven't seen Mandalorian since I simply do not want to give Disney any more of my money; I will probably just use a friends login to watch.

What little morbid curiosity I had left has turned to apathy. It is a huge problem on many levels when lifelong fans stop caring.

I know how it feels to just need someone to be there, even just for a short time to make it feel a little less overwhelming.

I am 44 and the best advice I can give you is that with time, therapy, and probably medication, it does get easier to handle. The good days will eventually happen more often and the bad days just might get a little less intense.

One thing I tell people with depression or anxiety is that they truly are much stronger than they realize. We deal with this illness every single day. It wears on us, but yet somehow we keep on going. Even with medication, a little of it will always linger in some way, but we keep pushing through. Imagine if we could transfer to the average non depressed person all of our mental health problems. They are so unequipped to live with that kind of weight that even the most up-spirited, happy & positive person out there would be begging for release in no time.

Amazing pay, great boss, work was only sometimes a little tedious and might require extra hours (since we had to fight upper management to hire more staff), but otherwise was awesome. Even with all this I never liked the idea of working so much. I would have loved half the hours for half the salary. Anyway, about 11 or so years into the job upper management changed and they brought in a new guy to push out my previous manager. 

The transition sucked and working for this guy was the worst. Having an amazing boss prior to him made this new guy seem a million times worse. The first few years he was not officially the manager since upper management (UM) tried to hide their true intentions so they would not look like major dicks. Half the group had the old boss, and new staff was being hired under the new guy. It was a major shitshow. Eventually this guy took over the group and my old manager stuck around for just a little bit longer to help those of us into the transition. Even before the new guy took over he was being an ass to everyone. He was the reason why I had to get on anxiety meds. I have never in my life seen someone nitpick over the smallest of inconsequential details. He loved to 'polish a turd' as my old boss called it. He also had a very condescending attitude and if you made the smallest of errors, would hover over your projects for weeks digging for more things to point out. Senior staff members dropped like flies. One of them went into retirement a few years early at a major loss just so he could get away from the boss. 

I was foolishly the last holdout of the old group. Considering how everyone in the company couldn't stand this person, brokers, actuaries, account executives and others, I figured I could just outlast him. I was so wrong. New boss was a massive penny pincher so no matter how he treated us, he always looked good (to UM). The new boss hired only entry level people because they were in his words 'moldable'. Meaning they were green (and cheap!) and wouldn't complain since this would be their first real career type job. They never complained and even thought he was fine to work for. Strange cool-aid drinking mother fuckers right there. Some of the new hires under this boss changed their tune once they quit and found people who treated them better. Anyway, being the last of the 'old group' I felt pressure from him ramp up intensely over the last 2 years I was with the company. 

He purposely singled out me and my projects to scrutinize as much as possible. I might get a final project completed accurately, but on occasion I might accidentally miss one minor step along the way that basically 'shows my work' like a 4th grade math exam. He would say I am not following established guidelines and procedures. Or I might make a small error on converting data from one type to another, which everyone did on occasion. These were always small things that were easily found during review and correctable. We were also prone to errors simply because our workload increased by 200% over the past 10 years, but new boss wouldn't have enough staff to match. The more pressure he put on me, the more mistakes I would inevitably make. By the beginning of summer I could tell the axe would be falling soon and by October I was fired. Strange how my anxiety dropped to almost normal levels when that happened. 

I have been unemployed since then and have had a few interviews. Going to one tomorrow that looks promising but is something quite different than what I had been doing. I honestly hate that any job can take up so much of your life. Add in a commute and sleep and your only time to actually relax is the weekend, which is when I end up spending time catching up on personal responsibilities. The thing is, that my last boss made me realize how precious my personal time and mental health is. I kept trying harder and harder to be as perfect and meet insanely high expectations and I did it at the expense of my own mental health. My tolerance for anyones crap is at its absolute lowest thanks to that guy. 

7 years of being treated like absolute shit and I am so worn out I wish I could retire. Too bad I am only 44. Ugh"

Anxiety,fg6o5g0,t3_ex4u7w,1580572972.0,"TL;DR - I prefer 1 on 1 talking and helping others. If you are reading this I am always there if you need advice or even just someone who will listen. DM me if you ever need to talk.


I dont like posting a lengthy response with no guarantee it will be read or acknowledged. Over the years I have probably deleted a few novels worth of my responses simply because it looked like nobody read them. I prefer 1 on 1 help more than a quick response on the main forum; I am all about the DM's. I feel like I can get to know the other person and cater my response to better help them. I have been through so much in my life and know I can do good, but I want to make it count. 

Even though I am a 44 year old with lifelong depression, anxiety, ADHD, and childhood trauma, I sometimes dont feel qualified to help in a professional way. Even after so many years of learning, therapy, and self help & reflection I still find myself getting stuck sometimes. Some of the things that work for me, may not be helpful to others so I worry I will waste their time or worse, give out bad advice. 

Side note: Seeing low effort posts like 'Fuck anxiety' with nothing more to add just make ignore them and sometimes the forum entirely. I feel like those are a waste of everyones time."

depression,ffj1gpc,t3_etqbpl,1579987999.0,"Not sure how old you are but when I was a teenager in high school (back in the 90's) my friends, and especially my best friend didn't understand just how bad it was for me. I remember one day he was over at my house and saw some relaxation cd's laying around and basically said ""What the hell do you need this stuff for?"". I learned then that some people, even your best your friends, may not really understand the stuff you are going through. I was a little bitter and even felt more ashamed than ever about my depression. It was difficult. But the thing is, as I got older, much older, I realized that 1 - people often don't understand something (especially mental illnesses) unless they have personally gone through it, and 2 - this applies to teens even more so as they have less 'worldly' experience and are still learning to grow up. 

My friendship remained and even over 20 years after high school, is still very strong with him. It may take a while but eventually they will gain understanding, and also learn not to be an ass about sensitive and important things like this. Try to find other friends or groups (like this one!) that you can join who may understand better. Try not to throw out the relationship with your friend just because they are being a pain in the ass. If I did that when I was a teen, then that person would not still be my best friend so many years later. He was always a snarky kind of person but he was not malicious, just not overly compassionate or understanding. Sometimes you can't help the ignorant. 

As a teen I learned that talking to my friends about depression and my issues at home would end up with them staring blankly at me and would think that the problems with my mom were too unbelievable to be true and that my depression was just a scheme for attention. You may have to learn to bite your tongue around them sometimes when it concerns more serious stuff. I know thats difficult because it really helps to have someone who cares that will listen to you when you need it. If there is one thing I learned is that people with mental health problems both grow up sooner (and stronger in some ways) than those who don't have them, but also those of us who suffer end up need support more than the norm. Keep those friends around to hang out with and be casual with, but maybe they just aren't ready to hear anything outside their little bubble. They won't get it so try not to blame them too much for being idiots. 

The other thing too is that sometimes, you just can't spill too much heavy, personal baggage onto people, even your best friends. Even as an adult I try to limit the amount or intensity of my issues I have to them. If unchecked, I go on and on (like this post LOL) and even though its just a little venting to me, it feels overwhelming to those listening. Sometimes my issues are simply difficult to relate to since most do not have a mental health problem they have had to deal with before. But your friends are also not your therapist either. Sometimes you have to keep things 'light' with people. 

I've been in your shoes and your post really struck home. It sucks dealing with ignorant people or friends who just don't seem to give a shit. But it gets better. People change. Friends change. Often for the better. Just know you always have us to talk to if you need to vent for the really deep stuff."

Since I decided to try and stick with the job (been there over 17 years) my boss started making life very difficult and basically smothered me and hovered over everything I did. He said that his behavior should promote someone to do better. I told him that his extreme nitpicking on the smallest of inconsequential details only does the opposite. So as he added more and more stress to my job, the more legit mistakes I would end up making. In the end, my mistakes were never a huge deal because we would always go through a peer review process and catch them. For the amount of spreadsheet work we did, mistakes would happen to everyone.

The 'new' boss had been heavily cutting corners and as senior people were pushed out, they were replaced with entry level people. I was the last holdout and so my boss made work more and more stressful for me to the point where I would make mistakes. The thing is, as a data analyst there are lots of spreadsheets and columns of data to compile and everyone always misses something so we peer review all projects before a report is finished. Anyway, it didn't matter what I did wrong, he started documenting everything to make it look like I couldn't do the job properly and then had a legitimate paper trail to show HR. Even when I had over 5 pages of documentation to show how he was a horrible boss, I had no defense against him. That was just over 2 months ago and the market sucks big time.

In the US it is almost impossible to be truly self sufficient without some sort of support like roommates, family, and/or government assistance.

On one hand, I hate seeing a person in pain or in trouble and wish everyone could have a fulfilled and enjoyable life. On the other hand, humans are so damned stupid and self centered and at best only think of their direct surroundings. Humans seem to have a difficult time seeing the big picture.

No matter how popular their city theme is, it would not have been enough. Even the more recent space and castle themes did not do too well.

I understand why TLG branched out with licensed themes as well as their own in house themes like Ninjago, Chima, and others. Cross branding helps drum up more interest, but I really miss the days when the narrative was not already spelled out in a movie, cartoon, video game, or especially laid out on the front of the box. I loved how with classic space and castle, you never really knew who the bad and good guys were or what they were doing.

saltierthancrait,f8bw0l7,t3_e01b9s,1574446622.0,"I am 44 and grew up on all things Star Wars. I bought nearly all the books, so many of the comics, saw the movies multiple times in theaters, etc etc. I saw TFA twice in theaters, but not out of excitement, and instead because I felt like I needed to better wrap my head around some of the details. I kept wondering if they purposely left important stuff out or that I was so excited that I got stuck with shiny-object syndrome and glossed over the details. 2nd viewing confirmed not only that they clearly did not want a proper connection to the OT through good storytelling, but also so much even within the context if its own movie didn't make sense. Then the characters - no explanation necessary on that. TFA created curiosity in me, but out of necessity, not out of excitement. I could forgive so many of the issues I have mentioned in previous posts if they just did a better job with storytelling and immersing the viewer into this new universe.

I got stuck watching TLJ twice due to friends and my wife only able to see it at different times. I left the theater the first time with TLJ even more perplexed than I was with TFA. So many things were left unanswered just as the previous movie, and yet what they did manage to give us was at least 5x worse. 

I absolutely will not be seeing Ep 9 in theaters. I didn't buy Ep8 on disc and will just wait for the Ep9 disc to drop on Netflix. This is the ""Disney trilogy"", not any kind of sequel trilogy. Ep 7 & 8 left me with such little care about the characters and story that the only reason why I want to watch Ep9 at all is due to morbid curiosity to see if any part of this mess can be salvaged. This trilogy put such a bad taste in my mouth that when the appetizer is bland, and the main course made me sick, why the hell would I want to stick around and eat dessert?

saltierthancrait,f8b2sst,t3_dzxe22,1574424782.0,"TFA was a mess. Sure, by comparison to TLJ, it was a ton better, but even taking that into account it wasn't all that good. Honestly, TLJ made TFA retroactively even worse by not answering any of the setups left for it. TFA had so many mystery boxes on the micro and macro level, that once you started looking deeper than surface level that nothing made sense. Long before TLJ came out, I could tell there was going to be a ton of things that would never be explained. The writing felt that sloppy.

On the macro level, things like why the hell the republic had all 4 of it's primary governing planets all grouped in the same system? Oh yeah, so we could use Death Star 3 as a plot device! Aside from the absurdity of how the Republic put all their eggs (and shipyards apparently) in one basket it still didn't make sense on an astronomical level how they had such an impossibly close orbit to each other that all 4 blasts could not only be calculated from the same shot, but each planet was viewable in the same screen. Since they could see one explosion from the planet Maz's cantina was on, then that means there were at least 5 total inhabitable planets all within the same solar system (near impossible odds just in that) AND were those 4 were close enough to be not just in a similar orbit to each other, but just so happened to be on the same side of the sun when they were shot. Even worse was that it first shows the 4 shots almost parallel to each other after DS3 fires, but then in the scene just before and as the planets get blown up, the angle of the 4 shots is much steeper, hinting at the DS3 being just off screen. The shot trajectory doesn't make sense. The basic astronomy of all those planets doesn't make sense. Nothing about that scene makes sense at all, except to push the idea that the First Order grew to somehow be bigger and badder than the empire ever was. 

There were just too many things that happened that didn't make sense from a character action, physics, worldbuilding or any other aspect, except to further the immediate scene or add unnecessary levity. Why did Han decide to use Chewies bowcaster when the scene just seconds before showed him as a crack shot with his own, killing 3 storm troopers without even blinking? Him using it was not necessary for the scene except as fluff. Then when he did use it, he was surprised by its power and I thought to myself - Has he never seen Chewie shoot it before? In his decades of friendship, that also just so happened to be the very first time he's ever handled it? If that happened in the Solo movie, sure, I could easily buy it, but this is years later. Yeah I know thats a minor detail, but when realism is sacrificed for scene progression it tends to yank me out of immersion.

Han light speed jumping through DS3's shield and not smashing into the planet? Insane piloting and trajectory calculating aside, how was this even possible in the first place? Oh wait, it didn't happen in the other trilogy movies because special reasons this time. A worldbreaking scenario for the sake of scene progression. Ugh, picking apart the Disney trilogy is just too easy. 

TFA has so much crap wrong with it that I don't even need to rant about all the issues with specific characters. They couldn't even get the basics down, let alone simple world building and continuation of the story set up from the original trilogy. In my eyes JJ barely did any better than RJ did."
