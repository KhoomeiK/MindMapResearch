Obviously not every celebrity is like this, but a lot of people are attention seeking due to not being raised properly. It’s worse if the celebrity has been this way since a young age.

Do I actually do bad things? I think everyone does bad things. Sure I think I actually do bad things. I didn’t grow up in what I consider to be a good environment, but I think that’s just me being ungrateful. My parents weren’t overtly abusive, they didn’t yell, they weren’t alcoholics or addicts, they were just trying their best. But I hate them for it. And I think the way I was raised has just made me prone to being a selfish person. I don’t care about other people really. I pretend I do, but really I just care about myself, how other people affect me, what they can do for me, how they make me feel. I don’t care about them. I’m not a forgiving person. 

I don’t actually think I’m a narc, although the thought has crossed my mind. I think at best I just have narcissistic tendencies (I am prideful and apologizing or admitting I’m wrong is exceedingly difficult). But I am emotionally unstable in general. Explosive, short fuse, easily offended. I’m an eggshells kind of person I think. I’ve tried to change but I can’t. I can’t just ignore how I feel all the time. It’s not my fault everything makes me upset. 

I think I’m irredeemable. No the people I know think I can change for the better. No matter how awful I am to them, no matter how many times I yell and cry and push and demand and act like the world centers around me. I think they’re idiots. I’m not going to get better. How much longer are they going to endure this from me when they have no reason to? I can’t just stop. I can’t just change. 

What if I said I was a child rapist? Would I be redeemable then? Or maybe I’ve killed someone. Or didn’t help someone when they needed it the most. Individual people may say that everyone is redeemable...but that’s not how society views it. I’m not a child rapist...but the point still stands."

It seems that no matter what you do if you’re rich, either try to spread positivity or feel negative, it’s a bad thing and you shouldn’t do it.

I tried to explain that just because they have more money doesn’t mean they aren’t as lonely or sad or hurt or suffering right now. There is no threshold to what we can materially have that will alleviate our hurt. We are not all the same.

I think everyone has a responsibility to vote seriously, however I do not believe that we have a responsibility to vote the way you think we should vote.

I don’t really want to go into a debate about what I want right now as that would take longer than I would like. 

The people who think Trump or Biden would be the best option for the country should vote for them. That is their right, and no one should be pressured into voting for someone they don’t believe in.

As for non voters, I think the only valid reason you could have to not vote is if you really don’t care about anything. I get we have a duty to society, but if you personally don’t have any qualms about an issue I don’t think it’s fair to force them to choose. The freedom to not vote is also important even though I personally think everyone should vote and vote seriously."
politics,fnj0ib9,t1_fnj04ue,1586989677.0,"Well if you want to argue the party system, go for it. I hate the party system we have. It’s messed up. But if you get enough people to think about all the options as equals, someday we could see a genuine person in office. 

You’re right, right now it’s not likely. But it’s only not likely if you individually decide it’s not. I’ve decided to stop compromising my core beliefs. And if every single candidate available compromises mine then I’ll take a second look and choose a “lesser” evil. But for now I’ve decided I would rather stick to my values than stick to a party. 

If you’ve got a way to take down the party system have at it."
politics,fnizsgs,t1_fnixhot,1586989305.0,"If everyone magically stopped thinking that, and voted for who they wanted instead, I think you would be surprised at the amount of people willing to vote third party. 

That would be an interesting poll for sure."
politics,fnixau2,t1_fniw91d,1586988013.0,It’s “not effective” literally only because no one thinks it is. Full stop. It’s as simple as that.
politics,fnix352,t1_fniw2u4,1586987904.0,"I’m not washing my hands of responsibility, I’m choosing to use my vote by putting it toward something I believe in. If more people did that maybe we would see a very different kind of election. 

In the tram scenario there’s only two options. There’s not only two options for voting. That’s just how everyone sees it. 

A better comparison would be if there were emergency buttons for the tram a ways away in different areas to stop it, a switch at the conjunction to change tracks, and 10 Witnesses to the event. Say the tram is set to hit the two people on Track A, but they are good people everyone likes. The group of ten people on Track B are all people who have done bad things and who people don’t like. It’s going to take nearly all 10 Witnesses to switch the track, but not everyone can agree to switch it. Some say it’s better holistically for two vs ten to die. Some say it’s better for 10 bad people to die than two good people. And yet some more want to try to run for the emergency stops so no one needs to die. 

In the end, a few people run for the buttons and don’t make it in time. The people who don’t believe in switching the path stay put, and the people who try to switch the path fail because there is not enough left. Now it is no ones fault that the tram did what it did, and everyone did what they believed to be right. What follows is people blaming each other for the outcome when it was not their fault. Group Buttons is sad that people died, but they weren’t going to compromise and choose who needed to die. Group Two did not believe in letting the 10 die, and Group 10 did not believe in letting the two die. You cannot blame people for doing what they believed in. People died, but they did not “cause” the death. Did their actions have consequences? Yes. But the alternatives were not something they wanted to participate in. They did what they could. Accept the consequences of your actions, and acknowledge that other people are okay with different consequences.

Maybe this isn’t the best way to go about politics, I don’t know. But that is how America has it set up for now. I think it’s okay to do what you believe in, you just have to stop expecting others to behave and want the same as you.

Sorry if that example was sloppy, but i think it gets the point across. In all honesty I don’t know if the “voting for who will win” is worse or better than voting for who you want. But at the very least I wish we could all just respect the way people choose to vote and not blame them for something they weren’t ultimately responsible for.  If you want to vote for who will win go for it. But don’t shit on me and blame me if your candidate loses. I voted in good faith just like you did. My reasonings aren’t yours and I would appreciate it if you didn’t force them on me.

**Edit:** articulated the tram scenario better"
politics,fniuig5,t1_fniqu0n,1586986594.0,"Some people just don’t understand that not everyone wants or thinks the same as they do. It’s funny because this isn’t a left thing, or a right thing, it’s a person thing.

“Oh, you aren’t voting for [my candidate]? Then no matter what you do you’re voting for the [candidate I don’t want]!”

Additionally, most of the time the “my candidate” isn’t even someone they support over every other possible candidate. It’s just the most tolerable candidate who’s most likely to win. Same with the “candidate I don’t want”. It’s just the least tolerable candidate who’s most likely to win. 

In general there are *way* less supporters of mainline political candidates than it would seem, but people just keep voting for who’s going to win instead of voting for who they actually want to win."
politics,fnip111,t1_fnimhnv,1586983829.0,"What if Biden wins? Then what will my vote have been? To the people who wanted trump I will still have contributed to the “the greater evil”. I’m still the enemy, just to the other side. 

I do not want a country with either Biden or trump as president. Of course I accept reality for whatever it is. But oftentimes what we consider the “greater evil” is not what others do. Because we don’t believe the same we should be blamed and punished? It’s a core part of what America stands for, the freedom to believe what you want. I’m doing what I consider best for society by my beliefs, and of course you will do the same.

In the end we want the same thing, just in different ways. I don’t like it when anyone starts complaining or hating on others for voting differently. Nobody should do it no matter who they vote for. And no one should shift the blame onto others for something happening that they did not want to begin with. If trump wins, the people you should blame are:

1) the people who voted for trump

2) the people who wanted to vote for Biden but didn’t vote for him

The people who didn’t vote for Biden or trump on purpose didn’t want either in office, so even if Biden won we wouldn’t have contributed to a “better society” in our minds.

politics,fniliyy,t1_fnikwec,1586982083.0,"Honestly I think people like you are a part of the problem. You’re so focused on voting for who’s “most likely to win” that you forego any chance to vote for who you actually want in office. I hate trump. I don’t like Biden either. You’re not going to convince me to vote for either of them. If you don’t want me to vote third party I might as well not vote, but I’m not going to do that either because I believe in voting.

Now, if you actually want Biden in office more than anyone else running for President, then by all means vote for him! But I draw the line when people start complaining that *I’m* the reason the “wrong candidate” got elected because I voted for who I actually wanted to vote for. 

There’s a term for that, but I forget what it is at the moment."
politics,fniknfx,t1_fnijl9g,1586981646.0,"Voting third party isn’t allowing “the opposing” candidate to win. The people who vote third party don’t want *either* of the two main parties to win. So both would be considered a loss to them.

To the “God made me this way” comments, Catholics believe that humanity is and will be forever broken until the second coming of Christ - we call it concupiscence caused by the Fall of Adam and Eve.

AskReddit,fmiaidl,t3_fu13a6,1586105697.0,"I hate movies with sad endings, so:

- Old Yeller

Really wth? Haven’t watched this movie since I was like 6 but I’ll never watch it again because the dog gets rabies and dies!

- What About Bob?

This one is just depressing. I honestly don’t understand how people think this movie is funny. It represents everything wrong with society.

- Hatchi

This movie started wonderfully and is probably my only credible mention. (Don’t know how to do a spoiler tag).

**SPOILER** Man adopts a dog whose breed is known for “choosing their masters” and such. Man does everything to try to win the dog over, and doesn’t really seem to succeed much other than the dog escapes his yard to greet the man everyday when he gets home from work at the train station. 

Then the man DIES and the dog spends the rest of his life (almost) waiting at the train station for his master to come home when he NEVER will. In addition to this, they show a scene where the dog “fetches” a ball, and I can’t remember if it’s before or after the death but that was the ultimate sign of loyalty and the dog “accepting” the human. And then this happens.

Spent over half of that movie crying. It’s a true story, and there’s a statue of the dog wherever this happened. There’s a bit more to the story but really this is the only important part. It was terrible, so if you want to cry and love sad movies, watch this one."
