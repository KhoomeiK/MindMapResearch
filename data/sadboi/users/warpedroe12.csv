BPD,ev6mbew,t3_ciiknn,1564248580.0,I wonder if I do but I'm not afraid of going out in public even though I know people won't like me. I think bpd has avoidant traits because I personally don't trust people but then I desperately want attention so badly. I just lash out if I dont get it. Maybe that helps resonates with your situation

BPD,euwl9ji,t3_chqr41,1564076551.0,"I like the name, it gives it a certain edge. But more importantly Bpd is a serious mental illness, nearing schizophrenia and bipolar. The name should resonate how serious our problems are on a daily basis. How horribly horrible we feel. 

Anything else would be an insult to me because there so many more symptoms that easily make it horrid personality disorder"

BPD,eul0f5t,t3_cgh0m4,1563895408.0,"Well you could definitely, but there are a good bit of disorders that look like bpd that couldn't actually be that. RSD, bipolar, CPTSD, Adhd.... 

The therapist is right about bpd's being unaware, but that's before they find out they have the disorder. I believed in all my behaviors and horrible attacks even after the diagnosis, but I was alot more self aware. I would get a psychiatrist or psychologist point of view. Therapists want to know you for a long time before they give diagnosis out, so don't take it too personal. Good luck"

I heard whispering from a corner one time when I was very paranoid and yes psychsis can be a part bpd."
BPD,eu0r512,t3_ce39z1,1563353429.0,"Im doped on meds so that helps. When I wasnt on meds every sec was dreadful fucking pain. I was so unstable i would walk out my job to quit without notice then come back walk out come back. I just wanted to break things, and be loved but my mind has a monster. And it creeps out less but its still there preying on me. You'll be better Op just look for meds maybe if you havent"
