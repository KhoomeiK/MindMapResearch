relationships,fr3curt,t3_gmbvey,1589854674.0,">  How do I breakup with my loving boyfriend, whom I'm still in love with?

A few tips:

* Be honest. Breakups suck and lying just makes it worse.
* Be very clear that you're breaking up and this is the end. Some people give mixed signals to avoid confrontation. Don't do that.
* Give as much information as needed, and nothing more. You don't have to go into extreme detail, or ""justify"" your breakup. But it's nice to give a reason. For example you can mention you don't think your personalities are compatible long term.
* Others might disagree, but I would say don't tell him you love him during the break up. Even if it's true, it can send mixed signals and make it harder for him. If he asks why you told him you love him recently, then you can be honest that you do, but that it's not enough for a long term relationship.

Take care of yourself post-breakup. Do not keep in contact. Reach out to friends and family both for support and simply to socialize with. Often the worst part about breaking up is not having that person you can talk to every day."

> Not trying to be petty but both of those studies you posted have no conclusive evidence. They are both correlation studies.


I posted four studies, not two (I think you missed them because the formatting put two per line. I fixed it.). Also, this Reddit trend of using ""correlation does not equal causation"" to dismiss any study one disagrees with is played out. Scientists know this very well, and they attempt to control for other factors.

From the last study for example:

> The results indicated that higher levels of positive affect increase the odds of using cannabis (OR:1.25 ,CI:1.06-1.47, P=0.008). However, neither negative affect, manic nor depressive symptoms predicted the use of cannabis. Cannabis use was associated with subsequent increases in positive affect (β=0.35, CI:0.20-0.51, P=0.000), manic symptoms (β=0.20,CI:0.05-0.34, P=0.009) and depressive symptoms (β= 0.17,CI:0.04-0.29, P=0.008).

So they made sure that the causation wasn't in the other direction (bipolar symptoms causing weed usage).

OP was talking about marijuana, so I addressed that. On the topic of CBD in particular, there has been almost no research for its use with bipolar disorder.

> In a meta-analysis published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry, researcher Guy Hindley and colleagues reported that in otherwise healthy adults, a single dose of THC (equivalent to smoking one joint) produced transient psychotic symptoms.

> The meta-analysis included 9 studies with a total of 196 participants. The researchers included studies in which participants took tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana) or placebo, and psychotic symptoms were measured.

> The researchers also sought out studies in which cannabidiol or CBD was given in combination with THC, but there were not enough of these to derive significant results. CBD does not produce schizophrenia-like symptoms on its own, and some think it may have anti-psychotic effects, but findings on this topic have been mixed.

https://bipolarnews.org/?tag=cbd (study linked by article)

All in all, the research on THC points to it exacerbating bipolar. And there's not enough research on CBD to say anything about it."
