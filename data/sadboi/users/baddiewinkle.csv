COVID19positive,fkx9iwk,t3_fl2nz9,1584622822.0,"I have been wondering the same as you, except I got sick back in early December. I started out the week thinking I just had a little cold, and by Friday it hit me like a pile of bricks. I was sick over the weekend while I was off, just absolutely miserable, and come Monday still had to call off work for a couple days because I was so weak. I was coughing, sneezing, had no appetite, feverish with chills, and could barely handle walking. I’m a dog walker, and even when I went back to work that Wednesday (only went back to work because I need that money, honey), I had to ask my employer to give me a lighter schedule for a few days because I was getting winded from walking. I think the illness had moved to my lungs, because as my cold symptoms subsided, I still had trouble breathing and would be very tired. Only reason I ended up getting better sooner, rather than later, is because my sister-in-law got me some antibiotics and an inhaler. I believe I most likely caught what I had from my mother-in-law, who had been really sick at Thanksgiving (and didn’t tell us before having us over). She is an Uber/Lyft driver in Chicago, often picking up passengers from O’Hare international airport, so I don’t think it’s that far-fetched of an idea that it could have been COVID-19. But I am no medical professional, so who knows? Either way, I am trying to bunker down and follow every possible precaution! Hope everyone stays as safe and healthy as possible!"
