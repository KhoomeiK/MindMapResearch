AskEconomics,fqkt57z,t3_gjg4wu,1589435552.0,"The housing crisis is fundamentally one of supply and rent control helps people in the short term but ultimately decreases supply because people are staying in a multi bedroom apartment all by themselves because it would be cheaper to stay than to move to even a studio. We need more houses and so yes a move like that by the government would improve the situation. 

However, I want to point out that in this case it is oftentimes governments that are the cause of the housing shortages. Municipal codes, building codes, zoning laws, local laws, and regulatory processes are all heavily geared against new housing being built, especially new multi-family housing. This legal and financial architecture has been created and perpetuated across the country because the current homeowners make up the local governments and building more homes would decrease the value of their properties by increasing supply. In big cities like Houston where those barriers aren't in the housing prices have stayed very low realtive to other areas of similar population and prestige. 

I want to point out though that at this point in time there is such a backlog of housing that needs to be built that the private sector may not move fast enough or supply housing in the most equitable fashion and so a government program would be in,that scenario, warranted."

AskEconomics,fpc42w4,t3_gcko3t,1588486933.0,"There are a few ways in which having a strong welfare system can be economically beneficial. For one it allows people to spend more time searching for a job that best fits their skill set because if they have welfare benefits supporting them they don't just have to get the first job they can in order to pay the bills. 
Welfare systems also help people stay fed which is important for economic reasons because hunger causes a decline in cognitive and physical performance which can impact a producers efficiency both in the short and long term. This effect is especially profound in children who can suffer long term decreases in academic performance from hunger. In the case of Medicaid or other health related welfare programs they help the economy by keeping people healthy and thus more productive. Preventing homelessness with welfare is also a way to prevent declines in a person's productivity. 

If people don't have any legitamite ways to take care of themselves like welfare they will oftent imes resort to crime in order to just survive and crime is very expensive economically speaking. 

Welfare systems can also encourage innovation and risk taking by ensuring that if a business venture fails the entrepreneur doesn't become homeless and starve. 

The welfare money spent also stimulates the economy by increasing demand"

It is much more a political idea than an economic one but it is ridiculed because it doesn't work. The data show that clearly. With the Trump tax cuts most of the money saved by companies just went to stock buy backs and the tax savings of rich people just hung out in their bank accounts. It is a faulty idea because it assumes that whatever the free market decides to do with the money is the most helpful for the poor but that just isn't true. If someone spends a billion dollars on a yacht that is not going to benefit anywhere close to as many people as a billion spent on building infrastructure. There is also the fact that when you cut taxes some of the money people get they are not going to spend but government programs have to spend all of the money allocated to them. If you do a 10bn tax cut only about 7 or 8bn is going to be spent and thus going to stimulate the economy whereas if you spend 10bn building a new road all of that 10bn will go into the economy.

While China does have other trade partners and continues to trade more and more with countries other than America it would still be harmed immensely if trade between it and the U.S ceased. The U. S still is a huge market for Chinese goods and the average Chinese person is much poorer and much closer to becoming poor from economic shocks than the average American. Something significant and of that nature would send 10s of millions of people into crushing poverty. On the American side of the coin prices of manufactured goods would rise greatly and there may even be shortages of certain products for a long time. China has cheap labor to be sure but it also has the best manufacturing infrastructure and technical expertise. The eastern part of the country is designed in every aspect to manufacture and it is designed well. It would take a ton of time and money to rebuild the physical and human capital China possess in another country like India. China also is the world's largest agricultural producers and as such good prices would rise greatly. With fertile land being realitvly unexpandable you couldn't really fill the hole that China would leave. I don't think the answer to this question is obvious because the harm would be quite dire in both nations. I think due to the fact that the US is wealthier I would say the damage would be bad for both but worse on the Chinese side

AskEconomics,fligan6,t3_foy2eq,1585181900.0,You are correct when you say that much of their wealth is an appraisal more so than anything else. Many of the things wealthy people own such as stocks and bonds hold no use value only sale value and as such its value is based on what other people are willing to pay. Technically all wealth measured in monetary terms is an estimation but these intangible assests have no other measure of value besides sale value unlike a house or a car which can be lived in or used for transportation respectively. Now as far as the  second piece of your question goes you most certainly could tax the wealthy. Whether a percentage of the total wealth they possess is taxed or a percentage of the gains in their wealth is taxed the wealthy would get a tax bill for a certain amount of money and then they would have to sell off whatever assests they choose to pay it or use whatever liquid money they have available. Billionaires etc acquire their wealth by either getting money in liquid form and then purchasing assests with it or just hanging onto the liquid money itself and so you could most certainly devise some policy mechanism to divert that money to poorer individuals like the employees of the company of they own.
