Problem is that it’s rarely ever a subject matter that’s used in a respectful manner and with due care. The comment even suggests that rape in his game is merely there for the sake of gratuity. People don’t hate rape in games because they hate ‘realism’, it’s because they don’t want to involve such a serious and complex issue in their tabletop game. Everyone thinks they can handle the issue well in their games but most of the time it will be either just bad or downright insulting.

Realism is relative to the setting as well. Maybe in most settings there never was this precedent of racial wars, slavery or widespread sexual violence.

I also totally reject his idea that if it’s not realistic then it’s for kids."

I know that Biden is not popular amongst millennials and that is largely because of his own doing and not because of the young voters. I completely get Bernie voters being torn between supporting the democrats in unity against trump, and also despising everything Biden stands for. 

To me it seems like change won’t just happen. If Trump wasn’t the wake up call then I don’t know what is. As much as a terrible candidate Biden is, does him winning really harm change? I think Trump getting a second term is also dangerous. Isn’t Biden himself a wake up call? I don’t really know the answers but I can understand people taking different sides, like Kyle."
