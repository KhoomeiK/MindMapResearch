ForeverAlone,fnj9nsw,t3_g1zhad,1586994625.0,True. Its not even only that they are more attractive than I am. Its that it would Litterally never work cuz they probably want to be with a normal person cuz everyone seems so normal and personality-less on dating apps tbh. So incompatible in every way. I feel you.

BodyDysmorphia,fnj5ev6,t3_g1ts0p,1586992302.0,Me too. Unlike most people i glew up when i was 7. Not even joking and its gone down hill every year since.
childfree,fnfb3zd,t1_fnf8grf,1586904732.0,Ahh. So would you assume that the average person is at least open to not having kids on gen z?
relationships,flgnuv9,t1_flgfsbm,1585146774.0,Is also a piece of paper that makes it harder to leave in the event that you decide to split up. Messy divorces < messy break ups.  Who wants to be with someone cuz they are obligated to cuz of a piece of paper? Just throwing in a different view point here from his side maybe. Being in a marriage makes it harder to make the choice (instead of an obligation) to stay. I’d rather be a choice than an obligation personally.

childfree,fcozbsf,t1_fcoz744,1577845778.0,I am in the same boat and thinking about it getting worse seems like a nightmare. I am trying to do exercises to make them somehow perky again but idk if that’s working even:/
ForeverAlone,fcoyvat,t3_ei84vh,1577845405.0,It’s all fun and games until you have some serious shit going on and you are nothing but a depressed inconvenience to them. There will never be anyone who genuinely gives a shit but yourself which is hard to hear.
childfree,fcoxwb7,t3_ehnv5y,1577844614.0,Bored and alone on NYE
