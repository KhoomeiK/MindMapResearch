The word has roots to white privilege and how the working class is being treated."
EntitledBitch,fo0qbs7,t1_fo0d8e1,1587417806.0,"*sigh* for the sake of this discussion: It matters because white Karen, in this post, is equating the word to a racist word as if feeling entitled or behaving entitled is supposed to make you feel oppressed. It’s like reverse racism okay? It does not exist."

UTSC,fn7t085,t3_g03ykh,1586727028.0,I just had an open exam and some readings can only be accessed online so I had it open in another tab and I also opened other tabs while doing the exams. Had no problems.
kpophelp,fmyrid7,t3_fy5jnp,1586493621.0,"If you watch some clips of kdrama her private life, you’ll get a sense of it. Fansite masters know a lot of things about their biases too such as who are they dating and whatnot. From what I know Taeyang’s fansites (and close fans) knew about min hyo rin already before it was reported but they are loyal and supportive so 👏👏👏 and dara’s fansites knew too that 2ne1 was going to perform at MAMA so they purchased tickets. That kind of insider stuff. Hahahah they are incredible."
