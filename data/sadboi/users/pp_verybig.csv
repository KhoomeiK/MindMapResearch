I had the same problem too, I used to have a lot of friends back then and I don't even know how's that possible looking at myself rn. I keep grew distance as my older friends switch class (some of them also transferred to another school), and I'm in different class. Highschool could get tough without anyone backing up for you, but I feel a lot better when I found a new friend. He's the only one I rely on, we talk about stuff that we like and agreeing on so many aspects that I may think he's the nicest person I've ever stumble into. But of course all those moments is temporary, I think our friendship seems more stale and bland (I always came to his house on the weekend and we would play vid games and watching memes). Each year I keep grew distance from everyone even my own friend and this issue is not getting better with him and me switch class with him being in science class and me get into accounting class (fucking boring elective and I don't even like math, but at least it not science class). I want to talk about it but I felt it unneeded as he's already have much work with new subjects and so do I. We're both going to finish highschool and find new path of our lives as we're both even going to be more separated. So I can't talk to anybody as I'm suffered from social anxiety, when I always try to do something productive (or doing anything that could make me happy in general) I always get blocked as this universe hate me"
