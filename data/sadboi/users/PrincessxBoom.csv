Anyway, he met Rose, a 23 yr old girl from the Philippines and “fell in love” with her. After talking online for some time, he flew 5000 miles to meet her in person only to treat her like shit. He disrespected her and her culture in many ways such as telling her to get a STD test but refusing to take one himself because he doesn’t trust hospitals in her country, asking why her house doesn’t have windows when he damn well knows she lives in poverty, pushing her to talk about her past even though she obviously has traumatic experiences that she doesn’t want to talk about. So yeah.

When you’re an insecure teenager going through changes and whatnot, you crave attention and validation. It means even more when it comes from someone older than you, which is why freshmen want to date seniors. This has been happening for years. The problem is that now, your phone gives you access to everyone in the whole world. Having thousands of likes and comments must do wonders for their self esteem. It IS creepy, of course, but I don’t think the trend will stop anytime soon."
