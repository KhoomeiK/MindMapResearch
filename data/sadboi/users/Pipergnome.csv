EDAnonymous,fq96p6j,t1_fq8ir1e,1589187533.0,"Mind if I ask why you’re going to Utah if you’re here from Canada? There’s quite a few private eating disorder clinics here if you didn’t want to go through the government route (long waiting lists). 

The daytime was recommended to me but I had never done it. I opted for weekly group sessions and individual therapy that I’m doing outside of the hospital. My psychologist has had extensive experience with eating disorders and she’s pretty amazing. I like this route much better. 

She even keeps tracks of my meals with an app called recovery app. 

Anyway, please be careful going to the states right now. The covid cases are insane there and they’re still don’t seem to be taking precautions properly.

Edit: there might be non-profit eating disorder groups around your city. In my city, they’re doing online weekly group meetings."
EDAnonymous,fq8cpfp,t1_fq4407g,1589163228.0,"So more from my comment above......to be admitted as a patient into the eating disorder clinic in any city in Ontario, I first needed a referral from my family doctor. Afterwards, I’d get called in for a 3 hour assessment. I had to fill out a shit ton of questionnaires. A doctor or nurse practitioner assessed it. They’d come and have an interview with me, take my height and weight. Then they’d relay that information to the head psychiatrist where then I’d have to meet him. 

He’d have a conversation and suggest what he thought is the best course of action (weekly group therapy for 8-12 weeks, daytime patient of psycho-therapy 5 days a week from 9-4, or inpatient care). He’d also prescribe bloodwork and ECG’s. 

If anything came up abnormal, you could even be called in the middle of the night to come to the hospital for in patient care (happened to a girl in the group therapy I was in). 

It concerns me how a hospital would recommend in patient care when you’re at a healthy weight and healthy bloodwork and such from just one phone call."
EDAnonymous,fq8bv6u,t1_fq6jdzn,1589162689.0,"I’m from Canada where the health department is publicly funded. Every move made on a patient needs to be justified and go through proper channels and billing. 

Of what I’ve heard from the states is that the health departments are all private and profit based. It definitely does have its advantages but it usually comes down to profit. 

Maybe I’ve heard too many horror stories, but I worry about things prescribed and short term hospitalization. Are they over-prescribing to add to their profit margins? 

So at this time, maybe the hospitals don’t have enough in patients to make their usual profits, so could they possibly be taking extra patients elsewhere to make up for it? 

Like right now, in Canada, all elective surgeries have been cancelled. Not sure if that’s happened in the states but if it has, it definitely hurts the bottom line of the hospital. 

Anyway, my experience of when I was anorexic, over-exercising and taking too many diet pills was that they’d only let me into the day time program bc all my bloodwork and other check ups came back normal. The day time program was like a full time job of just psychotherapy. You’d have breakfast, lunch and snacks there. You’d have therapy there from 9-4 pm 5 days a week. Even that is very limited. 

The in patient program had a limited number of beds and were for more severe cases that needed that medical attention. 

That’s why when you say you’re healthy check up wide, I wonder why they want you there 24/7 at such a risky time. Can you ask them to explain why?"

It’s your job to let her know that her feelings matter and it’s ok to voice them and talk things out. The more you belittle her voice, the more you give to Bella’s voice. Bella definitely seems to need more help and therapy. But ignoring Amy could start mental health issues as well. No need to start digging an extra hole when you’re already in one. 


My sister and I were in kinda similar situation. My sister went through depression and I tried my best to help. But it was rough on me to balance things with my own life and taking care of her. My parents always made it clear that her happiness was the number 1 priority. 

Even when I was in the right of an argument, I was yelled at if she cried or wasn’t happy. 

I had always been a bit of a rebellious kid and I would speak out at times about my sister or about rules imposed on me. When we went to family therapy, the therapist actually blamed me saying I was looking for attention and that’s why I was acting out. 

Looking back, that therapist was right that I was looking for attention but it wasn’t the way he meant it. When one child tends to be more high maintenance or has medical issues or such, the other child is often set aside more bc they’re easier and the focus needs to be on the main child. I needed some attention from not being put aside. (I also was a teenager that just wanted to do things whereas my parents were super strict). 

Anyway, years pass and the pattern continues. My sister is upset and we have to do everything to make sure she is ok. Now it’s the same issue 20 years later. My parents have little boundaries with her. Since they’ve always taken her side, she thinks what she says/does is what everyone should we following. I called her out on things and then she spent 2 years not talking to me unless I was helping her with something. 

These fights may not seem like much in the short run but it lays down unhealthy patterns in the long run"

EDAnonymous,fjmgxag,t3_fe85un,1583470299.0,"Hey. Initially I don’t know how long you were on the antidepressants for, but typically withdrawal symptoms are tough. Your body isn’t getting it’s daily dosage of happy chemicals anymore that it came to rely on. So your body would do crazy things during that period. Cutting off of them cold turkey makes the withdrawal period worse plus it’ll more likely cause a relapse of withdrawal symptoms. 

My binges got worse when I stopped cut off Prozac after a few months. Years later I went on Wellbutrin and lexapro for about 2 years. I hated the side effects. I was super constipated and always really sweaty. If I worked out, I’d still be sweating 2-3 hours later. Plus crazy dreams. 

Anyway, I was more careful about the withdrawal and it took months to cut off them. It was rough. 

If you think it would be good to go back on, maybe discuss your worries with your doctor. There are antidepressants that don’t tend to put on the pounds. Vyannse (I think that’s spelled right?) is supposed to help with binges. 

Your health is your mental and physical wellbeing. The two sound work together. If you feel like the diet is too restrictive with your mind, maybe there’s some adjustments that could be made."

For psyllium husk, don’t take too much at the start or you’ll just get super bloated. Drink lotsa water too.

2meirl4meirl,fiwao4c,t3_f9zs52,1582779602.0,Mentally ill but somehow made thru university. Completely fell apart after. Would get up and fall apart again. I feel like I’ve completely missed out on my 20’s.
EDAnonymous,fiw9zgr,t1_fivwgrz,1582779044.0,"On my own, which was a big mistake. I should have been getting support. It likely would have eased the suffering. 

When I started eating again, the binges became harder to control and the weight was coming on. So I cycled from bingeing to Ana to b/p for a few years. It was super painful emotionally and physically. 

Eventually I got comfortable with a higher weight than when I was restricting but less when I was bingeing. I think it’s my set point. 

But even with a good year at that point, I fell off the wagon and the cycle started again. Eventually it died down again. 

That’s why it’s so important to have to support. There’s less chances of these cycles and you have support as you’re going through them. 

Recovery is something we have to fight for everyday. Some days we won’t even need to think about it. Some days we need to give ourselves more self care."
EdAnonymousAdults,fispl4o,t3_f9k8oc,1582689978.0,"My therapist will call my ED, anxiety and depression my demons. I feel like it’s just an expression. 

Could she have meant that as a general expression to all ED’s and yours?

ED’s can be quite sneaky and smart. It doesn’t discount your smarts though. Take this for an example, I’ve lied and sneaked around my parents so many times. That didn’t take away from their intelligence."
socialskills,fiq47e1,t3_f99dr8,1582634556.0,"I absolutely hate when ppl ask such thing. It’s ok if it’s in a joking, rhetorical manner. Not if they’re asking you seriously. That’s just rude. 

It’s perfectly ok to be single. You don’t have to be paired up every moment in life."

EDAnonymous,fip5cc8,t3_f9250k,1582598379.0,"Yep. Tried to change my anorexia into being healthy. Turned into b&p and then just in binge ed. I ventured around between all of those. Now I’m somewhat on healthy with occasional binges. 

You’re taking a step somewhere. Get into some support groups and therapy. Find your way out. One of the best perks is when you stop bingeing, you usually lose weight to your body’s set point. 

It’s a long journey and it sucks. But there’s a freedom to recovery. Recovery doesn’t have to be perfect either."

rawdenim,fim17ik,t1_filzrtg,1582515432.0,Thank you. Definitely washing them. Got any helpful tips??
rawdenim,filzijn,t1_filz3an,1582514179.0,"Honestly, it’s my boyfriend’s jeans. He saw me horrified when he said he hadn’t washed them ever in the 5 years he owned them and asked if I would. 

I saw the 6 month rule online but wondered if the norm was years and not months?"
rawdenim,filyw42,t1_filyuy8,1582513730.0,No I mean years.
rawdenim,filytuz,t1_filyjtd,1582513685.0,Almost where?
rawdenim,filuqwc,t3_f853ji,1582510821.0,Is it ok to wash the raw denim after 5 years of wear?
selfhelp,filu2j9,t3_f8gq2n,1582510351.0,"Hey. Hope you’re doing ok. That’s horrid that you mom didn’t believe you or want to hear about it. I’m so sorry. 

This is quite a common occurrence with parents. Some just don’t know how to react and think if they ignore it that it will just go away. 

My parents blamed me about a family member sexually abusing me. They didn’t believe me when another had. My dad ignored my sister when she said she was abused. A friend’s parents had told her to just never be alone with men. A friend’s mom had kept her boyfriend even after she told her about how he abused her. 

It could go on and on. It’s going to be a super painful time for you and it’s best to find support that can be there for you regularly. Therapy is amazing and many therapist have sliding scales. Friends can help too but it’s best not to rely on one too much. Or maybe just use them as a distraction. Even if they’re online friends from here. 

I’m so sorry."
GetOutOfBed,filtebi,t1_filqm85,1582509887.0,"I spend a good amount of time around bed. I like sleeping 9 hours. I need to be in bed an hour before to calm down. Taking a shower/doing some yoga moves/turning down the lights and calming myself is required beforehand. So basically I end up revolving around 11 hours a day towards a good sleep. 

It’s understandable that with so much anxiety it takes extra time to wind down. It’s also understandable that when my brain is so wired all day that I’d need extra sleep. 

I’ve also heard the less happy you are, the more sleep you need. No idea if this is true but I notice when I’m happier, I fall asleep easier and can go with just 7 hours of sleep. 

No matter what though, be easy on yourself. The anxiety and depression is hard enough. 

Try to walk 30 mins of the day, even if it means breaking it up into 10 mins in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Try to get alittle bit of sun/fresh air. It helps with sleep a lot. And maybe watch some funny videos before bed."
sex,fijw45a,t3_f5bm3i,1582465981.0,"I know exactly what you mean!! The same happens with me. Some guys would mention it to me in an annoyed way. 

It’s a good thing. The guy just probably isn’t used to it. If he keeps making you doubt yourself, maybe it’s not a good match. Your partner is supposed to make you feel better."

oddlysatisfying,fiaa2w0,t1_fia9uv5,1582296631.0,"Yes but I had a big one for my shoulders. I didn’t have a pot big enough. Then the instructions also said to put a towel underneath and use certain types of tongs to take them out. 

It just ended up breaking after a week."

socialskills,fia8vld,t1_fia8on7,1582295855.0,"That’s so odd bc I would just look at the person behind me and mention them forward saying “you were here first”. 

I guess I felt too confrontational saying that to the cashier. I did the passive aggressive thing and went to a completely different and cheaper store."
StrongCurves,fia8q1k,t3_f7b6w5,1582295752.0,"I have a Fitbit scale that says my weight and body fat. I step on the scale, but I usually just pay attention to my weekly average weight that if calculates automatically on the app."
socialskills,fia8dc8,t3_f7axjm,1582295515.0,"I went into a store and the cashier took care of the person behind me. Next cashier did the same thing. 

I was so upset. Neither of the customers even said “hey this person was before me”. I got so mad I left the store. I didn’t even put my stuff away. I just left it at the counter."
Anxiety,fia833v,t3_f7b19h,1582295318.0,"It’s ok to have anxiety and not need to share with your work. Simply just say you have been stressed/overwhelmed with work or family and needed a day off. 

You don’t have to explain yourself or answer anymore. As long as you go back to work normally, no one will notice. 

Enjoy your day off and don’t add to the stress you already have."
