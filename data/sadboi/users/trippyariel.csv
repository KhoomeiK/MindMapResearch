I started losing weight almost a month ago. First I didn't think much of it and was trying to manage my calorie intake. Then soon after that I started walking a lot more since it got usual to walk 10-15km a day. Today I felt like walking wasn't enough anymore and tried to run for the first time in years and didn't really expect much. I ran 5k in 45 minutes!! Burned 424 calories. Also today we went for a walk in a forest with my dog in the morning (6k)  I feel amazing and so alive. Definitely can't wait for tomorrow to run again. 😊
(for comparison - a month ago I would be out of breath even after a bit of stairs)"

loseitnarwhals,fndabu5,t3_g13vpn,1586864524.0,"I used to binge and feel so guilty and disgusting that I would force myself to puke. At first it seemed impossible, but once I forced myself I felt so proud. I used to do that every time after binging. Later on it was getting hard for me to digest things and I would do that with some of my regular meals. 

That's super disgusting and made me feel like absolute shit. That's one of the biggest reasons I'm trying to make my eating habits as healthy and satisfying as I can because I don't want to trigger binging and all that stuff again."
loseitnarwhals,fnd9xz6,t1_fnd8x1q,1586864165.0,"And I think you're gonna enjoy it even more and more :) I've noticed that now I can't not go. Is it the same for you? I feel like my dog lol :D My body just asks me to go out and I have all this energy it's insane. Even at home I became a lot more active, always cleaning etc, cause I want to do something. Before weight loss I barely got out of bed on my days off."
loseitnarwhals,fnd8pu3,t3_g0v4bu,1586862955.0,Hey! I'm so happy for your progress! For me it's the same. I take my dog and walk at least 10 km everyday and it's amazing. I feel so much better and paired with calorie counting weight is falling off! I already lost 17kg / 37 lbs :) Stay strong and healthy!
