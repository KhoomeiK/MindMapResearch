unpopularopinion,fpl6zpv,t3_gdv9nn,1588707480.0,"I think that body shaming a person who can not change something is not okay. So, making fun of a bald person who is self-conscious about it is not okay. However, I do believe that body shaming an obese person (without being overly nasty about it) is okay and maybe even good. I think this because it could eventually give the push that obese person needs in order to lose the weight so they can be healthy."

He might be getting requests for sites when he doesn't even know how to code them, so he looks for other people to do it and then gets a cut at the end of it all. 

I haven't come across this in my email, but yeah definitely suspicious.

Also, if you are going to blur out emails try adding more blur as I can read them."

dropship,ewg3jnb,t3_co5sof,1565373112.0,"Everything looks pretty good design wise. What I would try to get is better images for the products however that isn't really easy since you are drop shipping. The images just remind me of wish ads and it makes it seem like your site is less professional. But again, you can really only use images that you can find in drop shipping (unless you take pictures of something similar to the product, but that's maybe a tad ingenuous aha).

WordPress comes with a lot more limitations than using something like twitter bootstrap. But obviously it doesn't matter that much because your site is just a shop."

It's like we smoke/get drunk to make us feel alive instead of numb. I agree with thefirststoryteller, in how you should probably quit drinking and just get high, its a lot safer imo as well. I definitely get high more than drunk, but ofc i would love that sweet sweet cross fade also. I play osu to pass time (a rhythm game) and I get a slight sense of accomplishment when I climb global ranks, but it's more of something to take my mind of bad thoughts that just like to plague my mind. I hope you can find something for you, like osu is for me as it might really help you at least cope."

webdev,evtt8ig,t3_cl969i,1564777860.0,"Alright. So, I think you should keep chugging along, think about what content you want to put on the site first with html, then stylize it will css. It makes building sites a lot easier this way if you aren't using any sort of library. 

Toying around with your site is going to be the best thing you can do to improve your css, html, javascript and pretty much any other language that you choose to pursue. 

If I were you, I would learn about how to use media queries to resize elements on your page so that your page is compatible with mobile devices, or smaller screens in general. 

Trending fonts can make a site as well.  [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)  google has a ton that are trendy and good to use.

Also another big thing to me is the colors that you use on your site, using a color palette is very recommended.  [https://coolors.co/app](https://coolors.co/app) This site generates colors that go well together, and gives you hex codes so it's easy to just copy and paste the colors you would like to use.

Padding and using margins with pixels is usually something I stay away from because of resizing issues that can come with that. I use % (1%, 2% are the most common values I use) 

&#x200B;

**The biggest thing to take away from this is just to toy around**, keep exploring what you can do with css and html and then later down the line maybe learn what cool things you can also do with javascript."
