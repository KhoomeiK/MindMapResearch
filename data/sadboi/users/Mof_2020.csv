It sounds repetitive but people like people who remind them of better selves and better or just as cool people that they have known..
 The worst part of not knowing when your alone verses having time to say that your needed is telling people they own a part of you bringing better for either them or who you are..

I don’t like holding back from know why or why not people like to be better or worse for people.

It sucks that people thing building past what people have is something others can say that is or isn’t what they need or not from a relationship 

I have been whored over that sense I was a kid

If I could I’d be sorry enough for myself then what it makes happier then what people need just because..."
