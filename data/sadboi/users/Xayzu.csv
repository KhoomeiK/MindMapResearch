As for exotic quests, we have one for the Tommy's catalyst... I fail to see the logic in any of your arguments, just as everyone else doesn't either it seems.

> You know what I do when I get bored of the game? Play other games. Shocker, I know. Fuck off, uninstall the game and deal with the fact that some people dont care about the same things as you do.

DestinyTheGame,fk700i5,t3_fgn8fz,1583923260.0,"In a way I'm kind of glad this season is a bit boring. Here's why.

1. I've been wanting to play some other games recently but haven't got around to doing so because I was constantly grinding for god rolls last season (Curse you triple tap/vorpal weapon trophy hunter that I finally got but without the correct magazine). Now I can play these games and not feel like I'm missing out.
2. I have parts ordered and delivered to build a PC, but unfortunately there was an issue with my CPU delivery and I had to refund and reorder it, delaying my build by a few weeks. The sole reason for this swap to console to PC was to finally have a better Destiny experience, but now I'm ok with it being late as I'm not as excited anymore.
3. It lets me catch up on past season content. I stopped playing Destiny right before season of Opulence, and missed all that content up until mid shadowkeep. I want to go back and get some of the weapons from the Menagerie, do the raids, and more.

It's pretty upsetting that trials is the main ""attraction"" of this season. I like trials but it doesn't seem special because we've already had trials in this game, and it took them this long to finally bring it back, but we just get old recycled D1 maps and armour along with it. Where is the new content actually? You could say the new public event but then again it just seems like Obelisks 2.0..."
