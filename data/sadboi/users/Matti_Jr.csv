I don't know if an annulment is still an option. If it's not, then you'll likely pay alimony for a bit (I'm guessing from the post you make more since you're the one who splurged on everything).

&#x200B;

If you have 6-7 people that want to play but don't always have the same people, two people could either share a character or create 2 characters with their own personal goals. The problem there is if they both show up to play on the same night; then they'd have to alternate.

&#x200B;

Do you have the Forgotten Circles expansion? It's $15 right now on Amazon. Gives you another starter class you can use without having to open a box for a character.

&#x200B;

Also, if some people just show up more frequently than others, you can always play scenarios casually (usually for personal quest reasons or grabbing a treasure missed the first time) or play rando scenarios. Maybe you can even create a houserule where characters at a much higher level could pretend to be a lower level just for the scenario and not allow them to use any ability cards that are a higher level than what they choose to play at. I briefly kicked that idea around, but decided against it."

Silver lining: any experience earned and gold you pick up are recorded on your character sheets regardless of whether you win or lose.

&#x200B;

Once you finish a scenario, you can always play it in casual mode again. Basically, you don't draw event cards before it and you don't donate to the sanctuary (but you could house rule either of those two if you wanted). I've noticed the Brute usually will be one of the first to exhaust out. The XP you earn and the gold you pick up will be yours to keep and if you complete the scenario in casual mode, you'll earn the additional XP for completing it too."
Gloomhaven,fcesgmr,t1_fcbxy07,1577623343.0,"Well, not too much you could do. Between all of the starter classes, the Brute is the most suitable because of his larger HP.

&#x200B;

What you can do since they're relying on you to absorb most of the damage is use cards that will limit how much damage you take. If you play Warding Strength before your first rest and no other loss cards, that will leave you with 8 cards and 4 rounds to play before your next long rest. Go slow in certain rounds to get up in an enemy's face, then play Shield Bash with Initiative 15 so you can go fast next round and have that extra shield for the whole round. You picked out Fatal Advance for the level 2 card I'm guessing which will pair nicely with Balanced Measure which will give you an Attack 4 (Attack 6 if you use that ability with Striding Boots).

&#x200B;

You can also pick up Hide Armor. I found that to be really useful and cheap as well. Heater Shield can also be useful early on. My friend swears by Iron Helmet which only occurs every so often, but I've seen that come up a few times now for his characters and that is also pretty cheap in the early going."

AdviceAnimals,f48mggx,t3_djs29j,1571442802.0,I've always noticed the day after I washed my bedsheets that my dog will remove the comforter and lay his smelly butt on the fresh pillowcase and sheet.
relationships,f48ejtc,t3_djp7r1,1571437321.0,"Sorry to read this dude. This is going to sound odd, but the universe gave you a gift of this happening now instead of down the road. If you two were married and/or had kids, things would have been a lot worse.

5 years is a long time to invest in one person. Take as much time as you need for yourself and take it a day at a time with your emotions. You'll get through it. :)"
relationships,f48e1kq,t1_f483zgl,1571437043.0,"Semi-related, but I did have an ex that ended up cheating on me to me and moving in with her partner after only a couple of months.

It really doesn't matter in the end. You heal, move on, and are better equipped for future relationships."
AskReddit,f48bzfg,t1_f4749jp,1571435922.0,"No. I want to be as loud, explosive, and smelly as possible to keep anyone from attempting to sit in a stall next to me.

So tired of hearing guys talk on the phone while taking a shit. Why does this have to be common."
Gloomhaven,f488vb4,t1_f46yqmc,1571434495.0,The guy playing Cragheart in our group has a tendency to go ahead or off on his own if there are multiple rooms and ends up owning everything in whatever room he opens. I'm seriously wondering if Cragheart is one of the stronger classes.
C25K,f3pparm,t3_dhpalg,1571062844.0,"But you have the endurance to pull it off. ðŸ™‚

Good job!"
spartanrace,f3ckn4a,t3_dggxxc,1570825135.0,That's fair for Elite qualifying. We won't have males running elite waves that don't belong in them. Some guys running the elite waves didn't take them seriously or clogged up obstacles for the elite female racers.
Gloomhaven,f2tgseh,t3_dd7xg3,1570394912.0,"You keep all the XP and gold you earn during failed scenarios. Personal quests progress counts too.

Chose whomever you want for the party. It might be more tricky running a Spellweaver and Tinkerer, but you find ways to make any combination work."
Gloomhaven,f2tayej,t3_ddmzed,1570392706.0,"Losing cards for rests definitely sucks. If you played this far in, you probably have a couple cards you absolutely love and don't pick to lose during long rests. That makes things a little easier."
AxisAllies,f2sxndb,t1_f2sx672,1570388217.0,"Ah, okay. Japan looks like they can lock it up themselves while Germany maintains in Europe."
AxisAllies,f2sx3sb,t3_de49qb,1570388008.0,How many victory cities do the Axis need to win? It looks like it's only a matter of time with Russia being out and the UK being unable to threaten anywhere.
spartanrace,f2sartt,t1_f2o6iti,1570380904.0,The muti-rig can be tricky on supers or beasts depending on what leads up to it too. Do you have a certain technique of going through it?
spartanrace,f2g8f43,t3_dd54r6,1570227699.0,"Beasts are so much fun. I look back at the races I've done and the longer ones were worth it. If only Palmerton had a beast! Although someone told me in Ohio that Blue Mountain used to have beasts...

Gloomhaven,f222wsa,t1_f1mae7r,1569880825.0,It's exciting. I do enjoy playing this! :)
AxisAllies,f1z1wp1,t3_daz3fz,1569830891.0,"Player fatigue or boredom is in the lead. :D  


I'm saying stick with your tie. Japan would likely take Hawaii first in at most 2 rounds while Poland or Germany could possibly fall to the Allies same turn or soon after. You should still do the massive naval battle in the Pacific."
C25K,f1wumy3,t1_f1wc42v,1569789678.0,Cool! It definitely gets I interesting trying to maintain your pace at those distances.
C25K,f1tfkci,t3_daqrqn,1569743521.0,Good job! Have you done any 5K's or 10K's yet?
