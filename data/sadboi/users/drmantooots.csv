BPD,fin45lo,t3_f8kamh,1582555331.0,"I didn‚Äôt think I really had a FP but I‚Äôm now realizing my ex is my FP. They have been stringing me along pretty much since I have known them. I stopped talking to them for a while because they were being selfish. It felt freeing. But they reconnected with me and I thought it would be different this time. It isn‚Äôt. But I love them so much I‚Äôd do anything to make them stay. I‚Äôm trying to distance myself, but I have no idea how. Fuck this disorder lol"

BPD,facvco1,t3_e8if9k,1575947946.0,I feel like this post is my brain. Have you ever been diagnosed with OCD? My doctors have said I have ‚Äúunspecified OCD‚Äù in which I have extreme obsessive thoughts that control/disrupt my day constantly. Are you On medicine? An anti psychotic might help you think more clearly. I‚Äôm on lamictal which helps at least a little bit. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre brains going wild right now.
BPD,facdjx8,t3_e8hbsq,1575937509.0,"Okay thank you. When I was 16 I was at my complete worst. I‚Äôm 21 now, but every single period it‚Äôs like I revert back to being 16 and haven‚Äôt gotten better at all. Guaranteed I will self harm on my period, I can normally control myself when I‚Äôm not on it. It‚Äôs literally a nightmare!!!"
BPD,facd4o1,t3_e8i3y6,1575937314.0,I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot recently and it‚Äôs so hard to accept. I feel like garbage! But time heals all wounds I guess.
BPD,fa6htmj,t3_e7rf0s,1575824873.0,"Medication like lamictal has really helped with my mood swings. Also, I know it doesn‚Äôt help now but I assume in school means you‚Äôre a teenager and I promise that it won‚Äôt be as intense when you‚Äôre older. Like, your hormones are raging right now + having BPD is a nightmare. But I‚Äôm 21 and although I still go off the rails it‚Äôs not as bad as when I was a teen."
BPD,fa6hgda,t3_e7qc2a,1575824733.0,"I highly doubt that he would do something like that considering your relationship now. I always try to remind myself not to split by saying ‚Äúif they were doing something wrong, they wouldn‚Äôt be telling me‚Äù he‚Äôs just making small talk. Don‚Äôt worry. And I understand your feeling too. I‚Äôm an adult and I feel ridiculous most of the time especially when I split. But we are logical, it‚Äôs just hard when your brain is trying to trick you. Make sure you‚Äôre expressing to him that you care and try to do opposite action. When you feel like your splitting, try to spend time or hold hands with him to ground yourself. Or shoot him a text to tell him you‚Äôre thinking of him. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in a tough situation!"
BPD,fa6f3p3,t3_e7vqb8,1575824043.0,"I understand how you‚Äôre feeling. I think right now it would be beneficial to try and reconnect with Christmas (I feel the same way about Christmas rn) and try to remember stuff that makes you happy/feel good or at least somewhat enjoyable on focus on those. It seems impossible, and I know how it feels to be self destructive and not care to stop it, but you can do it. Try to find a therapist and maybe speak to your husband about how you‚Äôve been feeling recently. Treat yourself and have a night of relaxation and self care. Cut and paint your nails, brush your hair, ground yourself and try to be aware of your life and that there‚Äôs more to it than BPD. You‚Äôre a person that happens to be struggling, but you‚Äôre a real person that people care about and your capable of getting better and doing well and being loved."
BPD,fa1506q,t1_fa14fpo,1575764688.0,"I take 200mg at night. I don‚Äôt really remember, but I think it causes a *small* amount of drowsy it might not be noticeable but I‚Äôve always been told to take it at night. And I‚Äôm super sensitive to side effects especially sleep and it doesn‚Äôt have any adverse effects for me whatsoever"
BPD,fa14d83,t3_e7jmde,1575764330.0,Lamictal is one of the only things I can actually take bc I have a lot of bad reactions to medications. It takes a while to build up but it helps me process events before reacting (at least somewhat) instead of going all out right away!
BPD,f9oym64,t3_e69wsn,1575516870.0,"Sounds like you are feeling a little sorry for yourself, (which I understand, it‚Äôs hard not to feel sorry when you are cursed with bpd) but if you are really hurting the people you love like that I think you need to stop feeling sorry and do better. It‚Äôs hard, but it is not fair that your family has to deal with this behavior. Get a therapist now and get on medication (lamictal has really helped calm my mood swings). Try group DBT therapy, it has really helped me because you can relate to a lot of people in there and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find someone who is going through the same thing. It‚Äôs not right to hurt the people you love like that. I hope you can get help soon!"
BPD,f9oxx4l,t3_e64j4f,1575516363.0,"I‚Äôm going through this right now. I actually just told someone I really love to never speak to me again because they do not care and they try to twist around and make it seem like my fault. It‚Äôs so hard and scary, but it can be done. It hurts that they don‚Äôt understand and just think I‚Äôm crazy, but I know I‚Äôll get over that in time.  Fear of abandonment I think goes both ways, in which it‚Äôs so hard for you to leave just as much as it‚Äôs hard when other people leave. It‚Äôs hard but I promise you can do it and you‚Äôll feel much better when you do. Obviously at first it will feel awful.(it‚Äôs so hard not to text and say pls talk to me again)  you can do it! Don‚Äôt let people treat you badly"
BPD,f9ovb6i,t3_e60s52,1575514504.0,YES!!!! I am 21 and I feel like I‚Äôm 16. I hate it cuz I‚Äôm so immature but 16 is the most impactful age that just stuck with me.
BPD,f93aa2j,t3_e3eytd,1575053875.0,This is amazing. Fear of abandonment is one of my worst ones it feels like I actually will explode if I think somebody is going to leave me. I also just got broken up with so I‚Äôm shattered right now. Thank you so much for sharing. You‚Äôre quite literally a badass.
