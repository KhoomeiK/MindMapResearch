Hello everyone and welcome to A Pretty Normal Podcast, a show that re-imagines what society considers normal. Each week I interview different guests about the topics they’re most passionate about. 

This week I had the opportunity of interviewing Harriet Robinson, a journalist, presenter and the host of Wannabe Greener, a podcast that focuses on sustainability and other eco-topics.

Harriet meets inspirational people whose actions are making big changes in terms of sustainability. Their interactive discussions break down myths and offer advice and tips and answer questions from listeners.

I wanted to speak with Harriet about her eco journey and wanted to get some advice for people who want to reduce their  own environmental footprint, but don't know where to start or think it’s too expensive to do so.

You can connect with Harriet Robinson on Instagram [@wannabe.greener](https://www.instagram.com/wannabe.greener/)

Hello everyone and welcome to A Pretty Normal Podcast, a show that re-imagines what society considers normal. Each week I interview different guests about the topics they’re most passionate about. 

This week I had the opportunity of interviewing Soraya Sheppard, the founder and president of Color Me Africa Fine Arts, a majority woman owned and run non profit organization centered on creating awareness of African visual artists in the U.S and Canada. 

Soraya immigrated to the United States during the uprising in South Africa in 1987 where many of her friends and family were being arrested for resisting the apartheid regime.

In 2011 Sheppard, a single mother of four adult children returned to her birth country to explore new possibilities and opportunities. What she discovered was a sense of despair, resignation, hopelessness and frustration at the government for failing to deliver on its mandate. This is Soraya's story and what drove her to create Color Me Africa Fine Arts.

If you enjoy this interview and believe in what Soraya and Color Me Africa Fine Arts is doing make sure to connect with her at the link below. As I said in last weeks monologue, there are many ways to participate in #GivingTuesdayNow and non-profit organizations would greatly benefit from any sort of contribution you can give right now so make sure to go check them out and connect with Soraya.

Human trafficking is a crime that forcefully exploits women, men, and children. According to the United Nations, human trafficking affects every country in the world, but it’s not talked about enough. I'm very proud to offer this platform to Rima to discuss these important topics and to raise awareness.

I also dive into the the economic and medicinal benefits of marijuana legalization. Being that this entire month of April is technically 4/20, what better day than 4.20.20 to talk about the history of 4/20 and where the cannabis plant stands in a few countries.

Hello everyone and welcome to A Pretty Normal Podcast, a show that re-imagines what society considers normal. Each week I interview different guests about the topics they’re most passionate about. 

This week I had the opportunity to interview J.R Harber,  an environmentalist, founder of a nonprofit animal rescue, and author of the timely, new post-pandemic fiction novel The Future Was Now.

As an advocate for stronger environmental and watershed protection, among other things, Harber pens a cautionary and timely tale that explores contemporary events such as a global pandemic, environmental pollution, artificial intelligence, universal income, and privacy protection all while challenging us to consider what we would sacrifice to give all a safer world.

The Future Was Now wrestles with different approaches to how people live and consume resources after a global pandemic destroys the world that we know today. The new society that rises from the ashes is forced to make tough decisions in order to ensure a sustainable world for future generations. This post-apocalyptic novel examines responses to current themes in distinct potential societies that we could become tomorrow.

Hello everyone and welcome to A Pretty Normal Podcast, a show that re-imagines what society considers normal. Each week I interview different guests about the topics they’re most passionate about. 

This week I had the opportunity to interview Michael Hsu, an intergenerational healer, host of The Heal From The Ground Up podcast, author of the book, ""You Are the F\*cking Sh\*t: Heal your anxiety, anger and depression from the ground up!"" This was a really cool experience and a first for the show. Instead of just doing a traditional interview, Michael actually did a spiritual healing session with me and let me tell you, it was awesome! I highly recommend everyone go check out his website and contact him for an appointment.

Thank you to everyone who supports the show and has shared the show with a friend or a loved one. A special thank you to our guest, Michael Hsu for coming on the show.

Hello everyone welcome to A Pretty Normal Podcast, a show that re-imagines what society considers normal. Each week I  interview different guests about the topics they’re most passionate about. This week iI had the pleasure of interviewing Monique, the host of the Infertility and Me podcast. A show that spreads infertility awareness and inspiration and gives a platform to those dealing with infertility. I'm really happy that I got the opportunity to listen to Monique's journey with infertility. I researched the topic before hand but there's nothing like actually hearing the experience from someone who has gone through this battle. Monique explained to me how the diagnosis affected her relationship, how her family reacted to the news, what she had to go through and what she would have to do to have a second child. This was a really inspiring episode and i'm so happy to give Monique a new platform where she can share her story.

Thanks to mutual podcast connections I’ve had the chance to watch her grow her podcast and give a platform to some amazing women and men who give wonderful advice and speak about career changes. Her name is Morgane Roos-Carreira and she is the host of Way of Living Podcast. We had a great conversation about a variety of topics including why she moved from France to London, child care, the concept of ""homosexualizing kids,"" what she has learned from her guests and more. I want to also thank her for being so open with me and speaking about her past toxic relationship.

This week I got to kick it with Hendel Leiva, the host of The Immigration MIC Podcast, a show that takes you through the stories and the reasons each guest is fighting for immigrants across the nation. Hendel reached out to me to invite me to his live recording at Hofstra University for the 100th episode of his podcast. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to make it to the event but I knew for sure that I wanted to get him on the show. After a few months of trying to coordinate we were finally able to set a day for the interview. I listened to Hendel’s 99th episode, a 2 hour tell all where he takes the listener through the rise and fall of his career. It’s an incredibly open and honest monologue detailing his accomplishments, his pride, his downfall and his faith which helped him bounce back and start over to use his talents  to give a voice to the voiceless.

This weeks episode features Yvonne Heath, author of the book ""Love Your Life to Death"" and creator of the [#IJustShowedUp](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/justshowup/) movement. Yvonne worked as a nurse for 27 years and in that time what she witnessed was how we are a grief phobic society, reluctant to talk about, plan and prepare for grief and death. It was a really interesting conversation about how to better handle grief and how to be there for our loved ones when they are going through it. I admit that death is not really a topic I like to discuss. It gives me an internal anxiety to think about family members, loved ones and even myself passing away. But grief is something we will all have to deal with at some point in our lives and Yvonne is helping make sure that people are better prepared for those moments. If you would like to learn more about Yvonne and the work she is doing please visit her website at [www.loveyourlifetodeath.com.](http://www.loveyourlifetodeath.com/)

(Explicit) This weeks episode features Sri Purna, a virtual assistant from Bali. In some of my previous episodes I had the opportunity to interview digital nomads and virtual assistants, but I also wanted to get the perspective of a local from one of these countries that have become hot beds for tourism and nomads. I reached out to Sri after reading a post she had left in a digital nomad forum. She was upset and wanted to speak up about her experience with inequality. We discuss how globalization opens doors for job opportunities but also wage inequality, white privilege,and illegal immigration.

This week I got the chance to speak to Joshua Shea, the author of “The Addiction Nobody Will Talk About” about his story and experience with porn addiction. On the outside Joshua Shea was a city councilor as well as the founder of a popular regional magazine and film festival in the city of Auburn Maine. But the addictions Joshua had been trying to hide for so long finally came to light when he was arrested for possession of child pornography in 2014. Joshua now devotes his time to trying to raise awareness about porn addiction through his book and his website [recoveringpornaddict.com ](https://www.aprettynormalpodcast.com/aprettynormalpodcast/episode/recoveringpornaddict.com)

It’s important to note that the Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Psychiatric Disorders for therapists did not include sexual addiction as a clinical diagnosis. However, not being included in the DSM-V does not mean it doesn’t exist.

I wanted to talk to Joshua about his struggle with porn an alcohol and learn more about the events leading up to his high profile arrest. Enjoy the full interview.
