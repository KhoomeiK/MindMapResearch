Basically it says you can be fired and/ or you can quit at anytime, for any reason, without warning. 

Which means they don’t even have to say “you’re fired for trying to unionize” they can just terminate you and not give an explanation. Most companies will come up with something: policy violation, attitude, etc etc... but a “right to work” works both ways. Fuck your 2 week notice if you find something better."

I think the biggest issue is the volume of systems. I feel like each fight has 3 layers to it, and if you don’t have everything prepared and set up at all times, you’ll just get rolled.
