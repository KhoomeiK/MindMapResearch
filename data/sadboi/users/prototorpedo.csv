I suspect this is because the propaganda machine here is just not that efficient as it is in the states.
It's also absurd to think deaths are underreported when people could have been dying of any of their multiple comorbidities, but a positive covid test (with false positives rangimg from 30% to 80%) would classify it as a covid death. Over here, people are offered money by the hospital to classify the death of a loved one as covid.

I really don't see a problem comparing 9 11 to covid because they are both problem - reaction - solution. The epstein situation in itself is like a conspiracy machine. Not only do I suspect Jeffrey was aware of the coming pandemic, but also could be one of the reasons for his ""suicide"".

>Are you saying his first suicide attempt, the one that put him under a suicide watch in the first place, was actually a murder attempt then?

Of course it was! Realize what you must think now: a person of epsteins caliber, having his information, leaning into a paper sheet, or an orange jumpsuit for what I think would be 10+ minutes to ""strangle"" himself in that cell where he wasn't even alone. That's bollocks. With the information he had, he could have easily srtruck a deal, and he knew that, that's why he was so chill before his death, according to his lawyers.

I feel like we're on two different sides here: on my side, I believe wholeheartedly, 0% chance of mistake that such powerful people exist that they can suicide you just like that, wherever you are, especially in a prison, at the slightest sign of you doing something that could harm them. Same people could easily engineer a pandemic, and some we even know are in contact with all sars, corona, mers research available. My theory is, it's not about me trying to make sense of coincidences, it's avout those coincidences being too many, with too slim a chance to happen. Bill Gates is the perfect example. Keeps buying into vaccine producers. Medical companies he funds have all the sars corona patents. He organizes a coronavirus type pandemic simulation. Shortly after, and around the time some of those patents get a final stamp, a coronavirus pandemic starts. Bill Gates now comes jumping out the gate with vaccines for something we don't even know yet how deadly it is. We don't know if the death count is correct. There is no chance in hell, or in the entire multiverse, that these are natural coincidences. Now i know what you may say: goody 2 shoes mr bill gates sniffed the imminent danger of a pandemic hurting the unsuspecting good people of earth that he loves so much, he's been forcing them pay his defunct operating system since 95, and quickly procedeed to buy a bunch of vaccine manufacturers and hire experts. For free, of course, cuz Billy ain't in the business of making money. And voila just like he ""predicted"", a pandemic does hit and who's all of a sudden ready to leave us get oit5of the house after a mere 18 months of unemployment and isolation? I propose it's again ye old problem reaction solution, a tactic so old, so frequently used, I am almost appaled we as a humanity keep falling for these same tricks, over and over and over again. So, to recap:
1. Bill buys vaccine companies
2. Does ted talks to get us to buy his vaccines. Nobody cares. Does coronavirus simulation. I guess still nobody cares. Well, now Bill is probably disappointed, and by sheer coincidence and stroke from God himself cleaning this planet of co2 emissions we go on to... 
3. Problem: Sars cov 2 drops
4. Reaction: media goes berserk, people start panicking, any cough or sneeze now is a corona. You get to the hospital, you have soar throat... Corona. Grandmother dies of old age: corona. Your cat dies. What can it be? Of course it's corona. And now to the final act:
5. Ol Bill wit da solution that ge bought at point 1. Not only that, Bill being the nice guy that he is, he's also going to get into education because we all know about the resounding success of the microsoft learning center or whatever. 

Honestly, this sounds like some essay a 4th grader wrote. And if I wrote this and you will still hold on to your beliefs of him being a good guy, epstein suicide and the likes, I really don't know what else to say except: why the fuck would gates push for vaccine tattoos? Why the fuck would he say, openly, the vaccine couls kill 700k and then grin like a little girl getting a barbie? Why would he say schools will be reopened but not large gatherings oh nooo only after everybody is vaccinated. Never take anything at face value. That includes what O write here, but most importantly it should include what a billionaire is saying or doing.

>Not sure what you mean by that. Again, humans are stupid

Yes, they are. And yet no, they are not.

I agree with you, and who knows, it might have been a placebo. All I can say is, I see a noticable difference between when I take vitamins, minerals, omegas, nootropics vs when I don't. It's not just that I don't get sick. I am also more clear headed, able to focus and control my emotions. I would not put that solely on placebo. And I would also not jump to the conclusions vitamins are simply placebos just because studies haven't showed it yet. Maybe studies haven't been focusing on this, but on other things, namely manufactured threats or what the medical industry deems worthy. In my opinion, the medical profession has not been focusing on the right things. First subject that comes to mind is nutrition. It was Hippocrates who said ""our food should be our medicine and our medicine our food"". This is such a long way to go since then, with all these processed foods, fast foods, mistery meats and dairies, sugars, empty foods and so on, and yet it is becoming increasingly clear the cleaner your diet, the better your health outcome. Nobody is studying a vegan diet, whether it prevents cancers or other diseases, reverts them or what it does and everything around you is orchestrated so that you continuously make the wrong choice. I believe it can be the same for vitamins.

> C'mon though. Millions of people? That's literally what you have to think

What I think is it can be very easy to manipulate people into believing things, without them ever even suspecting you are lying. In the case of HIV, for example, it might have been ""identified"" in a group of people that were actually sick of other causes but the fact that anti-body tests exist kinda invalidates that. But everything about this HIV shit is suspicious: the way it has no cure (how come other viruses have a cure, how come there'll supposedly be a cure for Covid in 18 months), the way (just like for Covid) you can have it and be ""asymptomatic"", even the studies. If it takes 5000 people, whoever they are, to get together to tell you that HIV causes AIDS, then I would assume it's obviously not true. But enough about this

In the case of Covid, however, totally plausible to create a sort of localized panic, overloading a few hospitals to create a panic, while other hospitals were empty. I haven't seen many videos from Italy. In fact, it is hard to find amateur videos of anything Covid related. Most of the stuff I have seen have been through the media. I don't think I need to go into how most of the media is corrupt and they can manufacture a narrative, even out of thin air, if they wanted. One of the first thoughts I ever had when watching footage from China, with people falling on the street and the likes, was that it was fake and those were actors. I believe it is the case. And by manufacturing this panic, falsely leading people to believe people need to be put on ventilators when we know 81% of people put on ventilators died in NY, innocent people have died in the name of a manufactured narrative. Just like 9/11. Covid could be like any other virus in our virome for all we know. Hanging around there since Nov 2019, not giving a fuck. But take normal people having a bad flu, add some corona panic, and you can potentially have yourself a manufactured pandemic. And I really can't be too sure about it until I see some actual numbers of who died from what, and I don;t know where to find that. But clearly I cannot trust the mainstream consensus which clearly leads to the leveling out of the middle class if you will. Let's call it ""poor become poorer"".

>  You don't know a single nurse or doctor personally?

I do and they basically said if you came in with corona symptoms, then you had corona.

> you think that people are really really smart, incredibly devious

Well, people are devious, and some are really really smart, and, to some extent, do tell things only to other people that can keep a secret, but not on average Joe territory, no.

> They usually involve a small collection of people from specific institutions, like the NSA, or Police departments

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172096/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172096/) (took me a while to find this actually...)

> *With regard to the viral-load tests, which attempt to use PCR for counting viruses, Mullis has stated: “Quantitative PCR is an oxymoron.” PCR is intended to identify substances qualitatively, but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers. Although there is a common misimpression that the viral-load tests actually count the number of viruses in the blood, these tests cannot detect free, infectious viruses at all; they can only detect proteins that are believed, in some cases wrongly, to be unique to HIV. The tests can detect genetic sequences of viruses, but not viruses themselves*

You're probably going to bash on the fact this study is retracted, but it has nothing to do with this statement we are discussing.

Right off the bat, it appears that all these ""kooks"" might be on to something: that no actual contagion test (the one where you take a virus, take a sample from someones lungs and prove the virus is the source of infection by prevalence in the sample) was ever conducted, since the approved method of testing, backed by the CDC, is this RT-PCR test. Again, not a scientist, but so far this looks to be the case. What were they testing with in the begining? How did they come to the conclusions that this novel virus is the actual cause of the disease? I, for one, am going to have to scour the internet for studies.

> Again, that's not information I can do anything with. I need a source, then I can more precisely explain how little I know about this.

This is the best I could find: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/02/no-proof-coronavirus-can-spread-shopping-says-leading-german/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/02/no-proof-coronavirus-can-spread-shopping-says-leading-german/)

I have been reading this all over the news in my home country, but they are not in english.

Who are all these people claiming this new virus lasts for ages? Matter of fact, who are all the entities fear mongering about this? I am sure you are going to conclude, as well as I did, they are exactly the MSM and their crony scientists everywhere around the globe.

And frankly, I am not in the very least impressed with your googling skills. Just a simple search on the web and you could've found out food poisoning with streptococcus aureus (same bacteria that causes pneumonia) is actually common, which would at least put a dent in your first point.

There is, of course, more to this and I will eventually get to the bottom of this. But in the very least, this ""pandemic"" is as suspicious as they get."

I, myself, am even less of an expert, but decided, due to straight up not understanding viruses and not trusting media, doctors, et. al., to research viruses, exosomes and relevant research regarding SARS, MERS, COVID-19 and the flu by myself and see what's what.

First  off, I have this misunderstanding: both this guy, and Thomas Cowan, who was the originator of 5G Coronavirus link (as far as I know), point to the fact the inventor of the PCR himself stated that the PCR test is not reliable and should not be used to detect HIV or other viruses. My misunderstanding is this: why would anyone use such a test on a novel virus?

Second, I would like to ask this: why would some German head of virology find in the studies done on residents in Heinsberg, Germany (that district that was closed for coronavirus observations) that there is no proof of contamination through supermarkets? When the conflicting information we were receiveing was that IT IS AAAALIVEEEEE...for up to two weeks on metal, a day on cardboard, etc. Moreso than this, why would a virus die?"

Why was there not a pandemic like this inbetween 2015 (when Gates made the warning) and 2020. Matter of fact, why is there no other coronavirus pandemic throughout history, except for SARS? Couple that with the scientific fact that SARS (which is also called SARS-Covid-1) originated in a laboratory. Couple that with the fact that ol' Bill here has been investing like crazy in vaccines.
