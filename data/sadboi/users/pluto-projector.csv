for 16b i think the lectures are still on course website too. maybe over the summer try preparing for it a little bit."

berkeley,fquw8ok,t1_fquestx,1589665497.0,"hey! 16a and 16b do not count towards the 3.3 requirement, only 61a, 61b, 70. If you want to see if you‚Äôre ready to jump into 16b, i would go to the course website for spring 2020 and look at the homework‚Äôs. if you feel like you‚Äôre getting the general idea you‚Äôll probably be okay (this class tends to be hard so dw if you‚Äôre not getting everything, remover that during the sem you have office hours and help available to you). also something i didn‚Äôt realize was that a lot of people take this class their senior year. that might be a good option for you since you‚Äôll know by then if you‚Äôre data science or cs. 

feel free to comment below if message me anytime for more advice/help with this, even after you start a berkeley!! happy to help."
berkeley,fqr9xmp,t3_gkdive,1589580337.0,"you don‚Äôt have to declare at the end of fall^

there‚Äôs sample transfer cs 2 year plans on the eecs website, def check that out. For the ee requirement, only 16b is necessary if you‚Äôve already done linear algebra at your cc. The only thing you‚Äôll be missing in 16b if you don‚Äôt take 16a is circuits and you can take a class on just circuits instead (47 something i think). this will be a lot easier than 16a, so i just wanted to lyk of that option. also most people hate 16a and 16b so i‚Äôm just trying to save you some trouble lol. 

if you can and are worried about declaring on time, 61a over the summer is also a solid option. it‚Äôs ideally the only class you‚Äôre taking so despite the fast pace of the class, you have a bunch of time to dedicate to it. worst case, if you‚Äôre doing poorly over the summer, you can late drop it (this doesn‚Äôt count as your 1 late drop pass at cal) and you will be really prepared for 61a in the fall.

as for data8, i would try to pursue cs for now, but if u realize you‚Äôve done poorly in 61a, then take data 8 the next semester. also it‚Äôs worth noting that since you‚Äôve taken linear algebra at your cc, you don‚Äôt need 16a or 16b for data science. so if you take one of those in the fall, and end up doing data science, it‚Äôs a waste of units."

berkeley,fq93mbl,t3_ghj5k7,1589184366.0,the best advice i can give you is to stay on top of the class. actually go to class bc you most likely won‚Äôt watch webcasts lol. start studying for tests at least 1 week early.
berkeley,fq91341,t1_fq90tar,1589181841.0,damn i felt that. but still please don‚Äôt do this. this is a lotttt.
berkeley,fq90y96,t3_ghimv3,1589181712.0,"Stanford will definitely have more resources for you overall because it‚Äôs private and small. but it‚Äôs worth nothing that about 20 transfers get in each year so you will be a minority and might have trouble fitting in.

berkeley,fpjhl0p,t1_fpjexn3,1588668776.0,I agree with a lot of whats been said^ also i would probably just not do merge (unless you already have) and just focus on debugging everything else. you can still get 23~ points without merge and merge is time consuming so leave it for last.

berkeley,foisfng,t1_foipyja,1587795521.0,"tbh I personally haven‚Äôt heard this rumor. I doubt the school will release an official statement on this because they probably want to encourage students to participate in final examinations even if they‚Äôre already passing. If anything, some teachers might choose to make an announcement for their class and say that you don‚Äôt have to take the final if you‚Äôre passing, but again, I doubt this."
berkeley,foippeu,t3_g7o8p8,1587793113.0,"If you‚Äôre already passing the class before the final, then in a sense the final is optional for you because it has no impact on your grade."
berkeley,fofafdf,t3_g77anh,1587731113.0,"Idk about the professors, but from a declaring standpoint, taking 61b + data 100 might be best. cs 70 is usually really hard for people so i‚Äôd recommend having a pretty (chill) schedule when you take 70 so you can really focus on it and make sure you get the grade you need in order to declare."
berkeley,fo7jhqb,t3_g5xhqm,1587579387.0,hey I was wondering if you could tell me where I can see my position on the waitlist for a class? It told me when I initially enrolled but I can‚Äôt find that info again on cal central.

berkeley,fmaohef,t3_fty2bd,1585901548.0,"i would definitely recommend taking cs10 or some other sort of intro course before 61a. yes, people take 61a without prior experience, but it will help you feel less overwhelmed and give you a head start on the material. don‚Äôt buy into this berkeley culture of just diving into the deep end of things, take your time and do well."

berkeley,fl3d837,t1_fl398bo,1584778489.0,"that being said, you will still have to work your ass off. definitely keep in mind that l&s cs means you have to be ready to meet the 3.3 gpa cutoff in order to declare, or potentially change your major."

berkeley,fkzyerf,t1_fkzxn8j,1584684460.0,"what did u think of the format? it seems horrible imo, super stressful. but it seems like the test is worth less in your overall grade which i guess is good."
berkeley,fkzw37m,t3_flo8py,1584682196.0,"it‚Äôs super useful, clubs use it for recruiting and post all events on there. also the meme pages and confessions are also great reasons to get a fb lol."

berkeley,fkwv5ys,t1_fkwuzwy,1584607229.0,"good point. yeah i honestly don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre gonna handle this. p/np for cs majors would possibly lead to them to do something else to weed ppl out. 

and with an influx of declared cs majors, the petition process will undoubtedly become more rigorous."
berkeley,fkwuxlv,t1_fkwuuic,1584606930.0,what point are u making? in a way its easier for them to declare if this goes thru because they just need to pass both courses and have gotten a B+ in 61A
berkeley,fkwt0q4,t1_fkwsw6r,1584604535.0,yeah I see what you‚Äôre saying. i would also hope they would create some sort of policy to address this. thanks for bringing up these points! we‚Äôll just have to wait and see what their decision is now.
berkeley,fkwsgaf,t1_fkws67w,1584603845.0,"i just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth the risk honestly. the petition is rate is extremely low. it‚Äôs different than meeting the gpa requirement with just 2/3 of the classes, and getting a P in the other. there‚Äôs many situations where all three classes are needed to meet the gpa cap, and if one of those is P you would have to petition, which as ive said, has a very low acceptance rate. 

also the grade you ‚Äúwould‚Äù have gotten might not be accurately represented in gradescope (or whatever they use) because even though they say they don‚Äôt curve, at the end they tend to boost everyone‚Äôs grades by a certain number of points. they do not disclose this number or add it to gradescope, it‚Äôs just something you see represented in your final letter grade, which in this case, you wouldn‚Äôt receive."

although you also make some good points. honestly it‚Äôs a really tough situation, not sure what the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer is."

I did horrible in cs 61a but i‚Äôm still determined to declare, despite how much harder i‚Äôve made it for myself bc of my shortcomings in 61a. if you really want to do this, keep going. you have a lot of time left in 61a to make up for this exam. Join csm, do all hw, labs, and extra credit. most importantly, start studying for the exams earlyyy. especially if you struggle, the earlier you start the better. legit 2 weeks before start taking practice tests. i believe in you. you can do this."

berkeley,fecs55b,t3_eogyno,1578982538.0,"there‚Äôs only one application deadline. i think it‚Äôs nov 30? based on your major and some other factors the school, if you are accepted, will tell you where you are a fall admit or spring admit. 

by major i mean if you are in a popular major like poli sci you might be a spring admit. i know a lot of spring transfers who were poli sci, soc, or something similar. engineering/cs majors are always fall admits."
