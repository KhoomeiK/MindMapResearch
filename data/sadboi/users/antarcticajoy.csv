actuallesbians,exi9ems,t1_exhkfgp,1566323705.0,"breakups are hard. my ex gf? we broke up 3 years ago, and i finally finally finally got over her (mostly) last month. things take time and i swear it will get easier. youre a great person: the way you handled it, how you still talk highly of her, and im positive theres so much more about you thats fantastic! 
life has a funny way of working out, but because we're living it in the moment its impossible for us to see the bigger picture. hang in there and one day itll all make sense, or at least mostly make sense haha. im wishing you the best of luck. if youre not ready to let go, dont try and force it. thats ehy it took me so long to move on, i kept trying to feel things i wasnt ready to feel yet. thats something you cant fake. just feel how you feel regardless of what everyone expects, and time will do the rest, i promise. 
stay strong, and im here if you wanna talk!"

AmItheAsshole,eton9sq,t3_ccnvdo,1563032461.0,"NTA for sure college is a massive decision. youre going to be working hard for a degree, it better be for something you are passionate about. i stuck with a degree i grew to hate and college nearly killed me by grinding my mental health down to nothing. do what you want to do, go where you want to go. at the end of the day the only person guarenteed to be there for you is yourself- so live your life for you. i wish you the best of luck, its crazy hard to get out from under  manipulative parent(s) but you cant live YOUR life for someone else."
AmItheAsshole,eseytjr,t3_c7ceui,1561912964.0,NTA no one can claim you invaded their privacy when your mom and aunt were the ones ruining the whole family's privacy. hopefully what you've done will force them to talk face to face like the adults they theoretically are and resolve this nonsense.

teenagers,erwix5t,t1_erwb5bx,1561344998.0,"im glad to help, im here for you! there are good people out here who want to help! suicidewatch can be hit or miss, i think it comes to posting at a time when more people are active. its unfortunate but nothing is perfect. I've found a lot of help there, but there are also a lot of other options. therapy is the best imo, its helped me stay alive for years and helped me develop some good coping mechanisms. its all up to you but there are lots of options, dont be afraid to seek help! ive never met you but i am rooting for you!!"
