Speaking of washing, I always think it‚Äôs good advice for colored hair to avoid washing it every day so as to not strip out the color.

Your daughter, a teenager, is going to feel hurt and mortified by the ordeal of having an out-of-touch parent jealously taking back a gift they received, and your lesson about learning the value of money is so far off base it‚Äôs not even funny. What do you think does a better job of educating a child on financial inequality than another person having the means to casually give them a gift they could never afford to buy themselves? Do you consider your child so stupid, and you so careless, that you couldn‚Äôt bother to address this concern with an educational conversation? It‚Äôs pretty rude and telling that you don‚Äôt think you did a good enough job raising your own offspring for them to, as a teenager, not somehow destroy a scarf. And yeah, that‚Äôs definitely the message your child is hearing. It‚Äôs hugely tacky and in very poor taste to steal a gift from someone to return it because you don‚Äôt think they deserve it.
You‚Äôve also offended your son and his girlfriend by showing that you don‚Äôt value their intelligence enough to accept a gift the girlfriend chose to give - implying she were too stupid to realize your poorly-raised child would obviously destroy the gift and doesn‚Äôt even deserve any expensive item anyways.

At this point the manager would have to ask the customer to stay while mall security was called but could in no way detain them - the person could just refuse and leave.

The twist braids will make spiral curls and the French braid will make waves so I‚Äôd say try them both and see which you like best! I used to use this awesome ‚Äúbraid cream‚Äù which I think has been discontinued and I can‚Äôt find it anywhere now, but if you have any product to put in it will help keep the braids from getting too frizzy while you sleep. Have fun!"
curlyhair,fdfr507,t3_el1tfn,1578368186.0,"My hair strategy when I lived in Florida was to try to braid or put my hair up to minimize the water exposure and keep it from getting tangled if it did get wet. I have very long thick hair so if I let it flow loose I‚Äôd have to just accept the tangled mess it would become and try to let it dry enough to gather into a messy sort of updo. I love the feeling of washing my hair after a day at the beach and getting all that salt or chlorine out! In my experience the chlorine was more damaging than the salt water, I‚Äôve even seen salt-water hair sprays designed to add that beachy texture without spending a day in Florida. Definitely only wash it once per day though, it would be more damaging to wash it every time it got wet than to let some salt or chlorine water dry in your hair and then get wet again later. Just finish out your nights with a good wash and your curl care routine!

As far as second-day hair, it is all gonna depend on how the humidity affects you. I washed my hair once or twice a week tops when I lived there because when it was freshly washed it was a frizzy disaster. My hair takes forever to dry and with the heat and humidity it would just frizz out like crazy until it got enough oil from my scalp (or me adding product) to smooth out. Plenty of my friends had the opposite problem. It‚Äôs all about the texture! But for second day hair in general I think braids are a good way to go with plenty of different options.

Have fun in Florida and don‚Äôt forget your sunscreen!"
