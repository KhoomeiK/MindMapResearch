Effort is a fockin hardcore thing my man, and I'm proud of you for trying, even if you don't presently see that as anything worthy."

I just saw that nobody replied, and I don't want you to feel alone.
I really do relate to some of your troubles, especially the last one about being selfish and consuming things.A lot of times,I felt like I was a nuisance to my family,but that killing myself would've been money in vain.
Let me tell you something: you are not selfish. I think it's fair and totally natural to want to die when you always feel sad inside,regardless if you are living an apparently normal/happy or ok life.
You seem depressed, buddy.I think there are some issues that you should tackle in therapy, but I know how hard it is sometimes to ask for help (or when it's expensive)!
I'm sorry if I couldn't really help, but I'm here to lend my ears if you want someone to listen to you.
Take care!:)"

I am not even near what you're gone through, but it feels like it has been a long period of you giving your best not to give in,right?
I'm sorry for not offering any practical solutions, but I really do hope you manage to survive. It's hard to see the accomplishments when you're drowning in pessimism, but in my opinion, you keeping yourself alive despite all of these shitty things happening is already more than enough."
