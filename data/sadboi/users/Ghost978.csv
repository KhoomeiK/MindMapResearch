I would love if more people posted questions instead of just pictures. Actually questions and discussions like this are why I started the sub almost six years ago, but I posted pics to get traction. 

&#x200B;

Second I hope I'm not too late to chime in here. I realize it's been a while. 

&#x200B;

To answer your question (which is a really good one btw) I have to go with the dreaded ""Depends"". 

&#x200B;

I don't wear them myself so it's all about what I like to see, and what I like to see depends on the wearer. For example, my wife looks great in white hose/tights but I've been with other girls who didn't look so great. With black you can never go wrong, nude/tan is great if the toes aren't jankity and there is a nice pedicure otherwise a thicker denier is best."

Vintage or not, I dig this look in it's totality."
