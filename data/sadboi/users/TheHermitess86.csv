I don’t know how long after she disappeared that the store clerk was interviewed, but it would be interesting to know if she could recall what clothing Maura had on. I feel like it was probably just a girl who looked like Maura. Back in 2004, I remember a lot of girls dressed like Maura with just jeans and a sweatshirt or some oversized jacket on. There weren’t too many girls who would be dressed up fancy in maybe a nice pea coat and slacks. Jeans and a hoodie/coat was the go-to outfit. So I really feel like it was just some random college girl and her friends who happened to look like Maura.

Maura didn’t really have any super unique features that would make her stand out, like one brown eye and one Blue eye or pink hair. 

Another thing I’m curious about is what Maura’s DMV photo looked like. I know her mug shot from the credit card thing had a lot of people saying that it looked nothing like her. I’m wondering how different her DMV photo looks compared to the known photos we’ve seen of her. Because she seems to look way different when she’s not smiling.

A lot of mental issues don’t really start to spring up until your early adulthood. She could possibly have multiple mental issues going on at one time, Which would just put an extra burden on her. The shoplifting and the credit cards.... it could be a manic swing from bipolar disorder. Then she could’ve gotten depressed from looking back and seeing the mess she had gotten herself into.

ChildofHoarder,fh3rbte,t3_f12t9y,1581271580.0,"That sounds exactly like me. I’m not a hoarder myself, but I’m suffering from some mental health issues which basically give me no motivation to do anything, especially tidying. So I’ve got clutter spread out around the house. Whenever I have a handyman or somebody like that come over, I am absolutely petrified to have them come in the house. I rescheduled the sink installer three times because I didn’t feel like my house was clean enough for him. I’ve also rescheduled my maid twice because I was embarrassed for her to come over, which is ridiculous. I never invite guests over, even my mother, and she is the hoarder.

My mother isn’t the kind of hoarder that keeps trash and garbage in her house, but her closets are overflowing with clothes... she has taken over the closets of three bedrooms (2 of them are double walk-ins). She has a high bed in one of the guestrooms and basically uses all the space underneath of it to store her dozen Christmas trees. She hangs plates and knickknacks on every empty space of wall in her house. She’s had my dad install extra shelves in the kitchen for her tea pots that she keeps accumulating. Her huge garden tub in the master bathroom Is unable to be used because she has filled it with statues of seashells and other trinkets.

We grew up in a pretty small house and over the years she filled it to the brim with stuff. When we moved during my teenage years, we got a house that was probably 2 1/2 times bigger than our old house. We all thought that her having the extra space would allow her to spread her collection out without the house feeling so cramped, but all it did was give her that much more space to buy more stuff. She has cabinets and dressers and small closets that are blocked by random shit put in front of them, like a card table that she never uses and an antique baby stroller.

Even though I don’t live with my parents anymore, I do feel like a lot of my mental issues are caused by them, not just by the hoarding, but by other things that they’ve done and not done over the years. But of course they’re completely in denial that they’ve done anything to harm my mental health, especially my mother."

DelphiMurders,fggogmo,t1_fgfu6b5,1580766109.0,Or maybe Kazak or Georgian.
mauramurray,fggn5a1,t1_fggdfk0,1580765327.0,"If so, it would have to be someone living in one of the neighboring houses, likely west of the Westmans. But I can’t imagine they would live more than two or three houses away from the crash site In order to either hear or see the accident, make it there, and then make it back to their house with Maura before anybody got there"
ChildofHoarder,fgaygk3,t3_exj5kl,1580656712.0,"I understand the frustration. When It comes time to try to clean out your fathers house, it’s going to be more of a burden to try to sell that stuff. And there’s no guarantee that you’ll find a buyer for his “ collectibles”. If he wanted to make a little nest egg for you all, he should’ve taken all the money that he spent on those collectibles and put it in the bank or invested in something more secure. Because unless he has something really really rare, I doubt you’ll get half of what he paid for that stuff. It’s the same way with my mother, although she doesn’t want her hoard to ever be sold. But I think she over estimates the monetary value of her stuff, as well. And I’m not going to have the patience to try to sell all of it when she’s gone. So I’ll probably just pick a few Momentos to keep for myself, have some auction place come and buy what they want, and then just have a free-for-all for the remaining stuff she’s picked up at thrift sales.

I think there’s a happy medium between being a hoarder and being a minimalist. There’s nothing wrong with keeping a few special trinkets, like a family heirloom clock or something like that. But hanging on to every single little thing and going out and buying bags of new trinkets that you don’t even need.... it’s ridiculous."

depression,ffyiv94,t3_doqwow,1580347478.0,How can we block someone who has repeatedly sent PMs?
mauramurray,ffyg25g,t1_ffyfn6l,1580345565.0,Wow! When did that happen? Can’t believe I hadn’t heard all this before. 99 is bad. Even if on an interstate where the speed limit would be 65/70. That’s huge.
depression,ffyfnxi,t3_evwfml,1580345294.0,"I can relate. My only suggestion is to find something To dedicate yourself to. For me, it’s my dogs. I’ve come to the realization that I will always be ugly, people will always think I’m a loser, I’ll never have a happy and loving relationship with anyone, and so I dedicate myself to trying to give my dogs the very best life they can have.

Watching them have fun on our hikes or little road trips.... It makes me feel like my life has some purpose. It doesn’t make me forget how much of a loser I am, but it makes me happy to see them happy"
mauramurray,ffy0vwd,t1_ffx1bxc,1580336336.0,Do we know why her license was suspended in NH?
ChildofHoarder,ffxxjct,t3_evozbi,1580334373.0,"Her saying you’re infringing on her ability to be a grandma is just her desperately fighting for control. She can still be a grandma & just buy smaller/fewer gifts. I know my mom is the same way a lot of the time. She thinks a giant bag full of almost useless stuff is better than one small, high quality gift."

ChildofHoarder,ffuggtw,t3_ev2dgk,1580241442.0,"I’m impressed that your mother hadn’t taken over your old room to use it for her own stuff. That’s what my mom did. Before I even had a chance to get all my stuff moved out of my closet, she went in there and piled all her stuff in there so now my stuff is trapped under hers.

Do you still have keys to her house? Maybe you could sneak over while she’s at the grocery store or something, grab your donation bags and sneak back out."
mauramurray,ffrg5zt,t1_ffmgm1p,1580157419.0,I’m glad you posted the timeline indicating when the person had allegedly seen Maura running down the road. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen the time mentioned before.
mauramurray,ffos2of,t1_ffo4afy,1580080953.0,"I didn’t say she was obese, I just meant that she wasn’t the tall slim girl like a lot of these popular missing cases focus on."
mauramurray,ffort2x,t1_ffnuafm,1580080893.0,"Yeah, the Brandon Lawson case is odd and the Bryce Laspisa one, too. Kinda creepy, really.
The Ben McDaniel case is another good one worth checking out.... kinda reminds me of Maura’s case because people are kind of torn between whether or not he met with foul play or whether or not his disappearance was staged. And the swimming area where he disappeared has been extensively searched, but no body has been found, although they did find some kind of shovel that was allegedly his."
depression,ffomuam,t3_euefgv,1580079308.0,"I’m the opposite. I wish my parents felt guilty because I think they’re a big cause of my mental problems, but they (especially mom) don’t seem to feel like they’ve done anything to mess me up."
depression,ffoistw,t3_euc8rb,1580078079.0,"That’s a big step! Good job! Brushing my hair is one of the things I neglect to do, too. It usually gets to the point of being kind of matted, so then I’ll go to the hair salon and have them wash it and brush it out for me. But I don’t even like going to the salon anymore because of the looks that they give me.... and the last time I went, the hair washer actually walked over to the hairstylist and started talking about me, Probably saying nasty things about me. I’ve never really liked that particular salon anyway because they’re very uppity, but this just sealed the deal. 

When I’m at home, I usually just pull my hair back in one of those chemotherapy scarves just so I don’t have to deal with it."
