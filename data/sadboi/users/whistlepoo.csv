valiant,fr0ji4m,t3_gloded,1589797886.0,"For VH1, definitely start with Solar: Man Of The Atom. He makes his introduction in this series and plays a large part in the run up to Unity. You might also want to read the issues of Magnus: Robot Fighter that lead into Unity as they also feature a future version of the character.  

Following that, definitely read Unity and then carry on with the Eternal Warrior series which takes place immediately after the events of the Unity crossover. I would also recommend Archer And Armstrong (at least the Barry Windsor-Smith issues which are sublime) and the early issues of Bloodshot as these series both strongly tie in with the character. Also check out the early issues of Secret Weapons as they feature the character heavily also. Although Timewalker again features the character's brother, it's not a great series and might not be worth your time.

Be sure to read Chaos Effect for a satisfying conclusion to Archer And Armstrong that also heavily features Eternal Warrior.

Towards the end of the Eternal Warrior run, it might be worth checking out the Geomancer series which was introduced much later. It feeds in heavily to the narrative but by this point all of the books took a severe downturn in terms of quality and cohesion. 

I 100% recommend you conclude your VH1 experience by checking out the released issues of Unity 2000 and reading the notes Jim Shooter made on the unreleased issues. They make for a very satisfying conclusion to the entire Valiant line."

MafiaTheGame,fqu9unj,t1_fqttsmu,1589654832.0,"Mafia 1 has a far more mythological quality to the narrative than 2. That is to say, each character serves a narrative purpose that relates to the classical themes of the story. 

Paulie serves as a reckless Prometheus, acting outside of the cold, unfeeling art-deco vs nostalgic, archaic dustbowl themes, challenging the gods (Salieri) and bestowing upon Thomas Angelo with the gift of fire (violence). 

Sam, on the other hand, totally encompassing the cold, soulless nature of this fast-paced art-deco future. This is reflected upon in his clothes (tuxedo) and also his weaknesses. It's particularly telling that of the two times Sam was injured, both took place in rural, pastoral settings; an old motel/gas station on the outskirts of town, and in a farm/barn. The inherint aesthetic values of these locations, and their nostalgic, warm connotations, are at odds with the merciless post-modernism the character encompasses. 

In the end, Angelo rejects Sam's post-modern values and is condemned, as a relic of the past, to destruction. 

There is depth to the narrative and the values of each character. They represent thematic ideas and ideals. Audiences can explore these themes and ask questions. 

The introduction to the game, in fact, sets up this primary aesthetic conflict, with lighthouses and green meadows giving way to cars racing down highway tunnels, accompanied by a change in musical tempo; slow rhythm gives way to aggressive sounds of conflict. 

As much as I've tried, I simply haven't been able to read that deeply into Mafia 2. Everything is presented at face value and the story is riddled with movie-esque cliches. Of note is the totally out of place dialogue that Vito spouts while executing Carlo Falcone, stating *'This one's for me.'* ' Except it's not for Vito. It's for Leo Galante. There is no discernible reason for Vito's sudden hatred towards Falcone. It's lackadaisical writing, designed to force personal motivation and create a character arc where there is none. It's false."

It took a few years living outside the country to open my eyes to a lot of the flaws.

I've been inundated with horrible messages every time I point out that: 

1. *Yes* the virus *is* dangerous. And it kills indiscriminately. 

2. One way or another, governments across the world *are* responsible. Whether it was their intention or not to increase the number of infected, that's exactly what they did. And they must be held accountable, globally. 

There is a deliberate, concerted effort to once again up the level of partisan rhetoric on this subreddit."

r/nothowdrugswork

Please- whoever reads the above post- don't be mislead. They're incomparable. 

Not only that but there isn't some hierarchy of drugs. 'Because you've tried weed, you're *ready*'. Absolute bullshit. The only time you're *ready* to take mushrooms is if you're over the age of 18 and in a good mental state.

Protip: If you take mushrooms, bring a friend along, be careful not to take too much, and you'll not only have a great time, but grow as a person. 

Weed is like getting drunk. Might lend itself to some insights at the expense of mental clarity but the purpose of it is to become intoxicated."
nextfuckinglevel,fosz8fw,t1_foqt6yu,1588041173.0,It isn't a complete collection. No Virtual Boy. No prototypes. Everything there is new. If you have enough money you could buy it all online within minutes. Not impressive.

unpopularopinion,foq1ynm,t3_g8rr5m,1587980036.0,"The last two thirds of season 1 was phenomenal for when it was released, before it became hyped. 

Season two was similarly great. Felt like they nailed the formula.

Season three was absolute garbage. Not a single standout episode. Summer is not a strong enough character to carry episodes and she was *way* overused. The finale also sucks. OTT emotionally sensitive dramedy territory. 

Season four backtracks to season one's absurdity and freedom but perhaps a little *too* much. Feels like they did a hard reset. It's nice to have some measure of continuation or overarching narrative."

Honestly, I find the whole thing so tiresome, having seen the exact same 'discussions' on so many other similar threads, I simply wanted to throw a spanner into your circle jerk.

Well, you would know after all. You sound so smart on all of your other comments."

Your choice of words in your original comment were patronizing and demeaning towards religious people. There in lies that self aggrandizement that pops up so often in discussions like these."

Yes you can, you dingus. Even Isaac Newton was very religious. 

>I just want them to realize that they are wrong in the things they believe

You hold yourself in such ridiculously high-esteem. A lot smarter people than you have *fallen for the god delusion*. 

Maybe people should stop praising God and just pray to you instead, seeing that you have all the answers."

There's a very big effort to paint 'conspiracy theorists' with a certain brush at the moment."

Thetruthishere,fo68oc7,t1_fo62png,1587550699.0,"Imagine a shapeless mass of energy that is aware of itself, as we are. It's able to comprehend it's own existence. In order to further it's own comprehension of itself, and grow to understand it's own existence (and by that definition, existence itself) it divides/ partitions itself, with these partitions moving further and further outwards from the source. Through this, it is able to consider itself from an almost third person perspective.

Universes, solar systems and matter derive from these partitions, yet they are essentially parts of this single creator. Again, *we* derive from this single source, despite being far removed. 

(This is the bit that begins to sound crazy but I can't think of an easier way of describing it.) Different forms of matter have different densities, with regards to their conciousness/ soul. As humans, we are third density. Animals and other such lifeforms are second density. Unintelligent matter is first density. As we ascend back to the source, we grow in density. 

So, in essence, we created ourselves. I understand if you take the whole thing with a pinch of salt."
