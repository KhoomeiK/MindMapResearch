Also the troop leader was strongly religious and her family was really close knit, and I, being an atheist and having two parents working full time jobs and raising us to be independent, was a problem to her because I was always doing my own thing or managing myself. 

She got mad at me for leaving our table at McDonalds to get some fucking ketchup for my fries, she told me to just ask an adult, and I wanted to tell her that I’m 11 and allowed to walk to the store without my parents, and fully capable of getting some fucking ketchup for my fucking fries, but instead I simmered down and just sat down, slightly more miserable then I already was."
