StopSpeeding,fr36436,t1_fr1446b,1589850708.0,"Adderall is stronger than Vyvance. Yes it is split 75/25 dextro/levo amphetamine but you aren't taking into account it is comprised of mixed amphetamine salts that are made of of levo/dextro. The mix of amphetamine salts is around 2x more potent per mg than Dexedrine and 5x stronger than Vyvance. Look on any medication calculator to see what I mean. 

After Desoxyn, which is about 2x as strong, Adderall is the most potent ADHD medication available. Probably the reason is not available in many places is because it can be overkill and is even more abusable compared to things like Dexedrine and Vyvance. 

Speaking of Desoxyn you may be tempted to make some comparison between it and street meth. While they may be similar Desoxyn is comprised of pure levomethamfetamine, which has less recreational effect than street meth. It's also different given the dose and route of administration. Desoxyn comes in 5mg pills which are ingested vs street meth which is usually smoked and taken at doses easily 10-100x higher. 

I got life changing results from Modafinil as it was the first medication that helped with my ADHD. It helped with my mood, also, it helped with executive function motivating me to be productive. But it didn't help with many of the core symptoms of ADHD like restlessness, inattentiveness, memory, focus. You'd be surprised by how little it helped with focus. As far as non stimulant options go I still think Modafinil is one of the best. I'd recommend it to anyone who has issues with abusing their medication, but it's not a cure all and I've had much better symptom management from stimulants."

For example taking a couple months to return to normal after taking it consistently for a few years.

StopSpeeding,fr0l3dh,t1_fr09wcz,1589799431.0,"I'm going to do my best to answer coherently considering I forgot to take my meds today. 

For starters Vyvance is Lisdexampfetamine, yes it is the prodrug to dextroamphetamine but it's hardly the same as Adderall. More like similar but different, Adderall is a stronger and easily abusable ADHD medication, it's only not available in my country so it's not really relevant. The treatment isn't an attempt get me off meth it's treatment for ADHD. 

>possesses very similar near identical traits of meth

Unless you actually have experience with meth I would say again, similar but different. Vyvance/ Adderall/ Dexedrine is not less potent meth, they are their own different chemical compounds with their own effects. Taking Vyvance does not remind me of meth, I don't want to abuse it because it's my medication which helps me. I'm addicted to meth, taking other stimulants does not sate the hunger for meth because there's nothing that can replace it, even smoking speed barely scratches the itch and that's a far closer comparison.

My relapses should not be a determining factor on whether or not I get ADEQUATE treatment for ADHD. Vyvance is not going to make me relapse, meth addiction is. Not being treated for ADHD however is a huge risk factor for drug abuse and relapse. If I was abusing my medication that would be a different story, but I have never abused my medication nor do I have any desire to. 

>amphetamine should not even be used with ADHD unless it’s a severe severe case

There's nothing to back up that claim. Severity of symptoms is not an indication to treat with amphetamines. There are many different circumstances that affect which is the optimal treatment for an individual. There's usually a split of people that respond better to methylphenidates, or to amphetamines, or those that can't have either and have to go with a different option. Everywhere except apparently the US (constantly seeing people starting with Adderall) Ritalin is the first line option, that's the standard before amphetamine treatment. 

I've already tried the first line option of Ritalin, it was helpful for most symptoms but worsened my mental state. It made me extremely moody, irritable and caused panic attacks. This isn't an uncommon response and it's one of the reasons why there are multiple treatment options. You still don't seem to get the point of Vyvance does not equal meth. 

>make sure you actually have true ADHD that was not induced by years of methamphetamine

Fuck off with your gatekeeping. Yes I do definitely have ADHD. I was BORN with it, as everyone with ADHD is. Cue me being called a space cadet my entire childhood as an early clue. I am and always have the poster child for unrecognised inattentive ADHD. The kid that's always lost in their own imagination while the world continues around them, the kid with so much potential that somehow struggles to do what comes naturally to others. My first day on Ritalin I found out what felt like to concentrate and I cried because I finally knew what I'd been missing. 

No it was not induced by meth abuse because surprise surprise my ADHD symptoms were present before abusing it, and still there 8 months clean of it. Neither was it years of abuse but months, broken up with attempts to quit. 

My story of abuse is very different to most probably in large part due to my ADHD. The most frequently I used towards the end was 2-3x a week, very small amounts by most standards with only a few multi day uses. Barely the standard binges of neurotypical meth abusers. 

Funnily enough meth is the reason I figured it out, it just took awhile for me to realise it. I realised quite quickly I didn't react to meth the same way everyone else would. Instead of a high usually I would just feel calm, relaxed, I could sit still, and my thoughts would be coherent. My draw towards meth was due to it being the first thing that made me feel normal. I know now that it was hardly normal but at the time that was the closest I'd ever felt to it. I was unknowingly self medicating ADHD. I wish I'd discovered prescription stimulants instead but that's how it happened. 

Eventually I did stumble across prescription stims. The first time was taking Dexedrine, I was given one, then two more because I didn't feel anything from it. Snorting Ritalin did nothing for me, I'm told the effect is like a poor man's coke but I wouldn't know because I just felt normal. That is not how neurotypical people react to stimulants. One of the reasons Ritalin is 'trialled' as initial treatment is because it's one of the fastest ways to confirm whether or not someone has ADHD. 

Anyway I'm not going to try Strattera or Guanfacine because I know my ADHD is a dopamine issue. I figured that one out after being put on Modafinil and it completely changing my life. It's a weak DRI but it was the first medication that helped my ADHD before I realised I had it. Once again, I'm not addicted to dopamine, I'm addicted to meth. You don't seem to have any understanding about meth addiction. Your Adderall abuse is not comparable to my meth addiction, it does not have the same triggers. This advice may be helpful for someone addicted to prescription stimulants but not to dealing with meth. 

So thank you for gatekeeping a diagnosis that's VERY hard to get in my country, giving out questionable medical advice, taking up far to much of my time as I feel obliged to correct you, and for doing everything but answer my actual question.

What I want to know is why your Dr started you on that dose in the first place. 60mg is a HUGE dose  to start on, it's no wonder you felt you were getting addicted to it. They should've slowly titrated your dose to find the effective range. A normal starting dose would be 10-20mg, you started on 3-6x that.

It still took a lot of effort to eat a reasonable amount of food even when I really wasn't hungry, when food tasted weird and the thought of eating food was unappetizing. I think part of it is just practicing eating, to always eat at least a few bites no matter how hard it is. Especially on meth I knew I HAD to in order to maintain some level of health. 

It gets easier eventually as long as you keep practicing. Remember that food isn't optional and you need it to survive and stay healthy.

I've had a relapse on meth since this has started, or a few depending on when you define lockdown starting. It's difficult to find a way to spend what feels like endless days. Take control one step at a time, start making small changes.

Try to at least limit your downers to the evenings, it may require slowly pushing your use later in the day to get to this point. But the goal is to slowly reduce the window until you only use at night. That way you can at least be functional during the day. 

With your daytime hours reclaimed it will be much easier to start rebuilding good habits. You can't expect to just cut out substances without something to replace it. Connection with others, a sense of purpose, and looking after your health should be your priorities. 

It might not seem like it but this is the best time to establish a healthy routine. This will be vital for staying sane for the duration of lockdown. Luckily you've had practice and it shouldn't be as hard to pick it back up. 

Make a schedule that works for you and try and follow it best you can. Wake up at the same time every day, whatever feels comfortable as long as it's consistent. Eat, shower, get into fresh clothes every morning, this will mentally prepare you for doing stuff. Start working out again, any exercise is better than none and it will help combat the dopamine deletion from doing stims. 

Find something productive to do, studying, reading, hobbies, anything. When you want to use take it as an opportunity to talk to someone. It doesn't have to be about your use, but you still need socialisation, and often seeking drugs is a symptom of lacking connection.

You can't expect to make a huge change all at once. The best way to change is to create habits. Luckily because there's so much consistency and control over your days right now this is the perfect time to do it. A habit is something you do without even thinking about it, because it's so ingrained. You start by making one small change and doing it consistently until you don't need to make yourself do it. Then you add another one. 

Once you are practiced in building small habits you'll be able to achieve larger ones more easily. But if you try and do everything at once you'll burn out and achieve nothing.

Then try to build a perfect morning and evening routine. This is part of building habits. Things that should be in your morning routine; taking meds, showering, getting dressed, eating, writing a to do list. Things for an evening routine; eating, brushing teeth, something to relax. You can add whatever you want to either so long as it suits you.

ADHD causes a deficit in neurotransmitter levels which are corrected by medication. These deficits left untreated usually results in fatigue, lethargy, ahedonia, they are symptoms of an understimulated brain. 

The reason ADHD peeps have trouble focusing, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, is because the understimulated brain is constantly seeking external sources of dopamine. Neurotypical brains don't really do that because they have sufficient amounts that they're aren't constantly seeking it out from their environment. 

It is possible to alleviate depression and anxiety just from adequate treatment for ADHD as it corrects the deficits in neurotransmitter levels.

I want to keep trying to stay clean. Because if I think it's okay to do it again even rarely then I'll keep doing it and I'll never get clean. Was trying to justify that every month or two would be okay but that's how it starts.

StopSpeeding,fop9ca0,t3_g8mh2w,1587955992.0,"I got diagnosed with ADHD early this year. I used meth a handful of times as a teen but didn't start using again until early last year. 

It was the first stimulant I tried. It made me felt clear, I could pay attention. I could actually talk to people, something that plagued me in every social interaction and caused social anxiety. I thought, ""this is how I'm supposed to feel, I finally feel normal"". Of course that still wasn't right, it wasn't normal, but it was the closest I'd ever been to it. 

As soon as I started abusing it more frequently I quickly became tolerant to the high and would just feel calm and serene. Something that never happened because I was a constantly anxious person. Of course the honeymoon ended and it started taking everything it could from me. 

I wish I'd discovered prescription stimulants instead and put the pieces together earlier. Even when I did eventually try them I didn't realise why they didn't have any recreational effect, because they were working as intended. 

I've been medicated now for 3 months. First on 10mg Ritalin but now on 20mg Vyvance. Ritalin made me moody and irritable although it did help. Vyvance has been much better but isn't fully effective at this dose which is lower than the equivalent dose of Ritalin I was on. Ritalin stopped my fidgeting where Vyvance has just reduced it. Still forgetful at this dose, had to go back home 3x in one day because I'd forgotten things, still leaving things in illogical places. 

I was diagnosed with BPD over a year ago while in the hospital psych ward. The circumstances surrounding it were extremely dodgy. Being told that they spoke to my psych when they confirmed that they'd barely spoken to the team at the hospital. I think it was given solely based on scoring high on the BPQ without investigating whether there were other underlying reasons. Most people with ADHD by definition would score high based on the impulsivity and emotional dysregulation aspects of the test. I want to speak to my current psych about possible misdiagnosis. With my current knowledge of the overlap I'm not convinced I have BPD."

The sleepiness was so bad that I was struggling to stay awake between 10-12 in the morning. I would have uncontrollable micronaps, even on the verge of falling asleep while standing up. This occured even when I'd take Modafinil with it.

StopSpeeding,fo25v3u,t1_fnvbyry,1587450698.0,"Everyone takes their own route to addiction. The first time having meth was when I was in early into high school, I was completely naive to drugs or knowing anything about them. All I was told was that it was an amphetamine, but I didn't know what that meant. I had it maybe 5-6 times before the friend who introduced me to it disappeared. I don't remember craving it at that point but I also never turned it down. 

This part takes place between the start of February to June last year. I didn't encounter it again until early last year. I combined it with a bad cocktail of Meth, GHB, and MAOIs, suffering though a very instant and painful initial reaction. Although after it passed it was one of the most intense highs of my life. Despite the reaction, upon being offered more the next day I still did it although very tentatively with low doses. 

I decided I didn't want to go through that again and turned it down once. Didn't do it again for nearly two months (I did take MDMA twice in that time, remember the MA in MDMA being methamphetamine). I was just transfixed by the smoke while watching and I know that that was the earliest point of addiction. 

It just took one incredible high for me to crave more, it really can just take once. If it's ever acted on again then you become increasingly more entrapped by it. I usually had very little (up to 2pts but usually much less) due to cost, wanting to keep tolerance low, diminished effect due to ADHD, but there were some outliers where I'd have maybe 3pts. No matter how little you use there is always a baseline for it reinforcing the habit, there's just extra reinforcement from having more to a bigger effect. 

It then was once a week for two weeks, before turning into using twice a week. Then I decided I should quit for the first time. I didn't think I needed to because I didn't think I had an issue, just that the person I smoked with decided to so I thought I might as well. It was incredibly hard, I was shocked that I was already so stuck in it, I thought I was just having some fun. I spent the first two weeks eating, sleeping, and staying stoned for every waking moment to cope, until I ran out of Weed. It was the first time I'd gone through anything like this. 

A few weeks later I tried Speed for the first time, it partially sated the desire but not completely. This made me thought I'd be fine with cravings. Two weeks later I did meth again, ended up using 2-3 times in a week again for a couple weeks. I found out my best friend was done with me because of my use. I decided I was done, without hesitation I immediately smashed my pipe. Something I'd never done in my previous attempt quitting. I wasn't going to let a drug be the cause of losing my friend, they were too important to me. 

From mid June until the start of March I only touched it again once. My friend was the biggest motivator for staying clean despite them being gone. I couldn't have done it otherwise, not for anywhere close to that long. Because staying clean for myself was not a string enough motivator. 

In March I relapsed 3 times, with a 8-10 day gap between it. I'd at least developed enough self control that I could make myself wait, time it between my responsibilities. The second time I overdosed because of the extreme potentiation effect from my MAOI antidepressants. It was also by far the greatest amount and potency that I'd had, nearly half a gram. The scariest experience of my life but it didn't stop me from doing it a third time. 

It's been about a month clean now, I've managed to dodge the majority of cravings by using DMT not long after, psychedelics have eased most cravings as well as the intensity. I'm lucky to have good quality of life, good friends, stability, future goals, treatment for my ADHD. I had hardly any of these things when I got sucked into meth and it became the centre of my life."
StopSpeeding,fo1zh3u,t1_fo02ja6,1587445326.0,"I use it interchangeably because they have very similar meanings and people tend not to be pedantic about it. Dependance: the state of being determined, influenced, or controlled by something else. Addiction: the fact or condition of being addicted to a particular substance or activity. Addicted: being physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance. I'm not here to nitpick over different definitions. 

Edit: Whoops posted too early

Using morphine for a medical purpose would in a way still come under both categories. Because you would be  mentally and physically dependant on it to function, as well as going into withdrawal upon cessation.

The effect caused by smoking for the first few times isn't comparable to regular smoking. Smokers don't get dizzy from it, that's something that quickly subsides. It's a social drug, along with caffeine, and alcohol it's one of the few that are both legal and socially acceptable to consume with widespread access. 

With time by smoking regularly you increase the amount of nicotinergic achetylcholine receptors. People who have been smoking longer have a greater effect from it due to the increase of receptors (simplified explanation) which is likely responsible for sensitisation to the effect of nicotine. It also releases more serotonin than is naturally released by the body as well as dopamine. Tobacco rather than just nicotine also contains MAOIs. MAOIs inhibit the breakdown of the main neurotransmitters NE, SE, DA, which not only make tobacco more addictive than nicotine but also increases the effects of most drugs if you smoke while having them. 

Due to the extremely short time between administration and effect it also makes it extremely reinforcing as the brain is almost immediately rewarded for using it. Inhalation is the fastest acting route of administration which makes it one of the most addictive along with IV. It is the most addictive drug with a capture rate of 50%. 50% of people who ever try a cigarette will become daily smokers at some point in their lives. 

>So what you are saying is everything is a choice until it's to late. 

I think that's a huge oversimplification. People need to remember to respect drugs as being very powerful substances. But also, taking drugs is supposed to be fun, when it's not then there's definitely an issue. 

Ketamine is extremely safe and useful for analgesia. It has great potential as treatment for treatment resistant depression. It's extremely fun and is one of my all time favourite drugs. It's also addictive, as almost all drugs are. LSD and Mushrooms both have a lot of use for personal and spiritual growth, psychedelics have the least potential for addiction of recreational drugs. But they aren't good for everyone or every situation and they should still be used with some care."
StopSpeeding,fnzn5m8,t1_fnwq2v4,1587397223.0,"It is through exactly this mentality that people get addicted, by underestimating it. That's what's so insidious about meth. It's the false sense of control, I see it an another effect of it. 

There are drugs you will feel bad after using because of drug comedown, like MDMA, Cocaine, etc. But when you're feeling negatively by not using a drug you are already at the point of chemical dependency in order to feel good or even normal. To get to that point you pass the early stages of addiction, progressively using greater quantities, or more frequently, or to compensate for some kind of dissatisfaction in your life, whether consciously or not. Very rarely do people realise their slip into addiction and dependance because that's the nature of it. 

Before I was an addict I couldn't comprehend what it was like. There's no way to understand until you've been through it, only sympathise and imagine. I would've thought that junkies are low lives, people that are desperate, mentally ill. I'm not proud that I used to think things like that, I know that isn't true but that's what society teaches you. You can't just sympathise with people that are mentally ill, because that appears to be the only justifiable reason in your eyes. Addicts can be all kinds of people with completely different reasons and circumstances. There is not one person who would pick me as a meth addict. 

Self reflection is certainly a defence from addiction but it's not a guarantee that you'll be safe. I'm probably am outlier in that I meticulously kept track of all my drug use since starting, over a year's worth of history is recorded. Sure I dodged a few things, for instance realising I was using Benzos and GABAergics with increasing frequency and then stopping. But they also didn't have the same appeal as my DOC. I only knew the signs after having gone through it before. 

That didn't stop me becoming dependant on Weed. Even when I could see that I was smoking every day I still didn't see it as a problem. I didn't see it as having a negative effect on my life. Yet the first night I didn't have it I had crippling panic attacks, I couldn't sleep without it, constant mood fluctuations. I couldn't believe it, weaning myself off it was awful and took many weeks of effort. But if you'd asked me if I was addicted before then I would've laughed and said no. 

I don't think that drugs are bad, but they are addictive. Anything that chemically rewards you for nothing will reinforce the behaviour. Almost all illicit drugs have their own medicinal value. Even meth, that's why there's the pharmaceutical version Deoxyn, but even that is modified in order to try and make it less addictive. I will stand by the belief that it is an evil drug that will take as much as it can from you. 

Nothing is clear cut, even raising doses of ADHD meds unsupervised can have valid reasons. There is a bell curve of effective range for managing symptoms. It being too high or too low will reduce functioning. There can be psychs who are uncomfortable raising doses despite it being too low, they might believe it's no longer effective (though that's likely from unmanaged expectations). The medication might not last for the full length of the day, that was the case for me, although I didn't raise mine unsupervised. You also don't understand that it is MUCH harder to get a recreational effect from it when you have ADHD, it's just the way you're wired. 

Healthy individuals don't continue to use. Maybe some start with the mindset that's it's just fun and slip in but the vast majority have some underlying need that is filled by using drugs. Whether it's boredom, seeking connection to something, feeling happiness, self destructiveness, novelty seeking, numbing pain, in order to sleep, be relieved of anxiety, performance enhancement, behind all of it is a need for something. 

Harm reduction and access to reliable information is not a luxury everyone is privy to. Most countries don't have a harm reduction approach and the blanket drugs are bad approach undermines belief in the risks they can have. 

>Why crave something that kills you

It isn't a choice. No one ever thinks that they'll be an addict. If that's all it took then people wouldn't smoke tobacco. 

It is a learned pathway in the brain that causes you to seek out your DOC. It gets reinforced every time it or any drug is used. When people are under stress they default to habit or impulse, using drugs ends up being the path of least resistance."

It was only months later after being treated with antipsychotics and recovering that I realised that those things weren't right.

StopSpeeding,fnursql,t3_g3mt02,1587269410.0,"I'm talking mainly from my experience with meth. Also I'll say that if you are getting euphoric or speedy effect from amphetamines that it's doubtful that you have ADHD. Unless you're talking about meth. 

It starts by thinking that you don't really care for for amphetamines. That you don't feel the need to to it again so it must not be that bad. 

Meanwhile every single time you use it the highly reinforcing properties of dopamine release will create a pathway in your brain driving you to use again. Your brain will associate the drug with pleasure due to triggering the reward centre of your brain. This will happen with use no matter how much or little you like it as a drug. 

Even if you don't care for it you will be subtly driven to use again. It's almost worse if you don't particularly like it as you feel a false sense of control rather than liking it a lot and realising it's addictive. It slowly erodes at any limits of self control you impose on yourself as you gradually bend and break your personal rules on use. You find ways to justify continuing, and early on there doesn't seem to be as many negative effects. At this point the pleasure gained is higher than the negative effects which in itself also reinforcing. 

It's not until you try to stop that you realise that it has a hold on you. As soon as you tell yourself you can't have it at all the cravings set in, you want it more intensely than you expected. You'll find any way to justify that you're in control of your use. You'll fool yourself into thinking you're in control because you don't go on binges, or because you only use x often, or that you're still doing everything in your life. 

By the time you actually realise you're addicted it's far past when you actually reached that point. I realised I was addicted a couple months after I actually became addicted. It's only after looking back you realise. By the time you start the slow erosion of breaking your rules you're already addicted. Even before you get to the point of breaking your rules you are not in control. As soon as you have to justify your use by saying you stick to your rules on use you are not in control. If you're planning your use, if it's more than even once a month you are not in control. 

As someone who has dabbled in many drugs, a few times narrowly dodging the slip into addiction with various substances. Nearly got caught up with benzos, I have felt the addictive nature of opiates and know I could easily have an issue. Even weed was very difficult for me to free myself from, but that took several months for me to become dependent on. But NOTHING is as mind controlling and insidious and sneaky as amphetamine. 

Even when it becomes clear that the negative effects outweigh the positive you will still crave it. Even after overdosing on it, the single scariest experience of my life. I STILL craved it and it didn't stop me from using again. Everything it gives it takes away 10x as much."

But it takes a higher dose for people with ADHD to achieve theraputic effect. 

If she is on a higher dose than she was last year it's probably because she needs more. ADHD medication doesn't usually need dosage increases *except* while growing. In which case it's very normal for it to go up.

It is possible to take both safely, but it should be done with careful supervision and the ability to make adjustments until the right dose is achieved.

*•Marijuana*

*•GHB* - at regular doses

*•Benzos* - at reasonable quantity

*•Acid, Mushrooms* 

*•Nitrous oxide* - remember to breathe

**CAUTION POTENTIATED**

*•Amphetamines* - can be safe at theraputic doses but should be reduced to account for nearly doubled effect and duration

*•Meth* - use extreme caution as it is possible to overdose and or cause hypertensive crisis quite easily as I have overdosed this way

*•Opiates* - dose should be reduced to account for potentiation and should not be mixed with other sedatives alongside MAOIs due to increased risk of respiratory depression

**SEROTONIN SYNDROME**

*•MDMA*

*•DXM & Cough syrups*

*•Opiates* - Do not use opiates that have an effect on serotonin due to risk of SS

**WARNING**

*•DMT* - Despite MAOI + DMT combo being the main component of Ayahuasca this combo is not safe beyond very small doses.

The few 'safe' drugs with MAOIs being weed, GHB, benzos, psychedelics (excluding DMT), and Nitrous oxide. 

Amphetamines are extremely potentiated by them and can actually cause overdose when combined. Opiates are strengthened and combined could cause respiratory depression. MDMA, DXM, and most cough syrups would cause serotonin syndrome. Even micro doses of DMT causes physical discomfort, regular doses leading to head and chest pain needing medical attention. Cocaine and ketamine are also dangerous to combine.

Every time I've combined something I've done so aware of the risks and had a backup plan in case things went wrong. Which they have several times, leading to hospital visits when I haven't been able to self manage."

StopSpeeding,fmv900m,t1_fmuv7eq,1586409374.0,"It's important to remember that psychedelics themselves aren't just a cure all for breaking through your conciousness. Time, setting, and headspace are all very important to factor in. It seems like you pounced on it as a cure rather than a tool. If you're dealing with negative emotions and situations it is likely to bring it up. This can be good or bad depending on whether you accept the message and confront your issues. If someone is not willing to deal with their problems and work on them I don't think it would be a positive experience. 

The other factor is that I have gone through the going clean process before. It was to reassert my goals and desire to stay clean after relapse. I mentioned that it reduced cravings drastically but don't mean to recommend for that purpose. Everyone has their own journey, it isn't the best thing to do it unless it's right for the individual person. 

The last couple times having DMT after using were in ways difficult and confronting to accept but ultimately helpful and relieving. It also allowed me to face my grief for a dead friend which I had been repressing."

This is completely different to my usual experience which tended to be intense cravings for the first week or so which gradually let up. I'm really surprised by the lack of cravings just because of the DMT. 

LSD also helped me but it wasn't nearly as long lasting, it would usually be 5 or so days before craving again. I'm unsure of the effects microdosing psychedelics would have on cravings but they could help."

Basically all the robot stuff.  

What it didn't help with is fidgeting, restlessness, doing study. When I started Ritalin I got through 2-3 times the work in the same period just because I was actually able to concentrate on it and block out background noise. Before I would be drifting off, getting distracted, reluctant to do work despite wanting to complete it.

With Ritalin I manage my time better, it used to be a huge struggle to get places on times. I wouldn't realise how long it took to get ready, find things, get there. I'd get lost doing one thing for too long then be running out the door trying not to be late. It also normalises the progression of time, it feels linear instead of stretched out or super fast. 

Unfortunately it doesn't feel like it helps me particularly well with motivation and executive function. It's still really hard to push myself to do things and I have to basically work up the willpower for it. Basically have enough mental preparedness juice for it before I can start. This is the main reason I still think amphetamine medication would be better for me. I've never had issues abusing any stimulants but meth, not concerned about that side."

As wonderful as Modafinil is there are still particular things it doesn't treat for me. I discovered afterwards the large improvement is likely due to treating some of the underlying issues with ADHD I didn't know I had at the time.

Current medication helps with depression, anxiety, psychosis, ADHD. Unfortunately I still have a lot of fatigue issues on current meds despite the Ritalin and MAOIs being stimulating. I'm hoping to be changed to a different ADHD medication that makes me less irritable and is more effective for me.

It allowed me to make progress in life, I was happier, motivated, was actually awake with energy during the day, I slept consistently at night, better executive function. I made more progress in life from a few months of it than I did in the last year prior. I was able to decrease the frequency with time due to the DRI effects and still maintain a good mood. It also helped substantially with my addiction issues and cravings. I had been quitting meth, which I initially managed by being stoned for every waking hour for 2 weeks. Luckily I was prescribed Modafinil not long after I ran out of weed, and the cravings became so much more bearable. 

The only issues I had were a small rash from increased histamine early on, this cleared up once my body adjusted. Also after several months of use I wasn't getting enough sleep. No other side effects or issues."

Day 2 - Skip dose

In disagreement with everyone else and as someone who has used it in past due am extended amount of time. I think that could be a solid plan. It's doubtful that the Modafinil itself will actually cause weight loss, it mostly gives motivation to have an active and healthy lifestyle. But if you're using it for appetite suppression and it works for you to use it near daily I don't see any issue. 

From what I can see this is mostly based around diet and exercise with Modafinil as a small assistant. Especially at a low as in reasonable dose I don't see it having a negative effect so long as you are getting enough sleep. As sleep deprivation is likely to have a negative impact on weight loss. 

I would recommend supplementing choline in your diet as Modafinil works mainly through acetylcholine. Easiest thing is to make sure there are enough eggs in your diet, or some alternative source. Please give an update on how it goes I'd like to see if it works."

DrugNerds,flj3baq,t3_fp2sp7,1585197644.0,"Your dosing frequency is far too high. I would not recommend any neurotypical person taking it up to 5x a week. This is from the standpoint of addiction as well as quickly developing tolerance to the effects. 

If you're going to continue stick to Ritalin. You already know it's effective for the goals you want, it has less chance of side effects addiction, and the cost to benefit will likely be better especially in the long run.

Given that Adderall is an amphetamine it is much more addictive than Ritalin. Even if you have managed to dodge an addiction to it like you claim it's going to be unsustainable with Adderall. It will deplete your dopamine reserves very quickly with regular use especially if done 5x a week. It doesn't mean that you can't recover from it but it's not going to feel good. There is also a strong possibility of becoming reliant on it either for mood or to chase the results that you're looking for. 

Modafinil will not help you get smarter, in that aspect it mostly helps people with cognitive deficits. It's much better for general productivity than studying, that goes for ADHD and neurotypical people. 

You should try to take only as much as needed. Redosing throughout the day is likely to lead to tolerance and dependence. That said the half life of Ritalin is quite short, only 2-4 hours. Any lasting effects during the day are likely the dopamine + norenephrine reuptake inhibition."

If you want to quit for good you have to commit to it from the beginning. You need to do everything in your power to make it hard as possible to use again. You have to preemptively sabotage every avenue of using again. You need to prepare yourself to refuse it, and then to leave if it ever shows up unexpectedly.

-Supplement more choline in your diet, precursor for acetylcholine, so eggs for breakfast. If you're deficient then Modafinil doesn't really help with wakefulness.
