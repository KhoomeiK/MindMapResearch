I would suggest asking the doctors how to get in touch with a therapist for yourself, as it would definitely be a good idea to help with all of the things you are dealing with. They should be able to connect you with various resources, but in the meantime connecting with any supportive family or friends might help. Finally I just want to say remember that none of this is your fault, don't try to shoulder all of the burden. Depression does take effort to manage, but it is manageable.
