You can count on me. You could get help. Thats what I did. My psycho shit started when I was 14. I needed 5 years to get help. I went to a mental hospital. It worked. It didnt change all but it was a good start. Find something you like. For me it is programming. This is my goal now, to learn programming and get a pro in it and finally find a job."
