The thing is, i was not able to do the non- medication things that work best, until i started taking medication.

If you are suicidal,  please please go to the hospital. Dont let these abusers be the reason your life goes out. You are reaching an age where you will start to have more control over where you are staying and who is around. Not that it's easy financially but it's not permanent. You have your whole life ahead of you and you may not feel like it but you are handling this as well as anyone could. ❤"
BipolarReddit,fnhmsmd,t3_g1s0ge,1586965246.0,"Please please please start with finding someone to take care of your child, then immediately work on the suicidal thoughts. I know you are immunocompromised but if you avoid a hospital when suicidal, you could die anyway, so the risk of not going is higher than the risk of going. In the past i have driven to farther away hospitals in the outskirts. The care is not as good but it keeps you from being in a waiting room for as long. 

To get sleep, maybe talk to your pharmacist if you cant get a hold of your pdoc or primary care physician? Not sleeping for this long is an emergency. Maybe there is something like unisom that could help. 

Also i know meditation stuff doesn't seem like it will work but Headspace has a free trial and they have a set of sleep tracks that actually work for me. They may not put you out in your current state but it's likely they could help you at least calm down."
BipolarReddit,fnhlm7r,t1_fngba19,1586964649.0,"Just read, thank you so much for sharing. I have never experienced psychosis in that way, but have definitely had some delusions. Once for a few months i felt like if i had a certain bandana on my head in a certain way it made me kind of take on a persona that was more likable and more grounded. I knew it didn't really make sense and couldn't be real but i still enjoyed it and didn't realize it was a mental health thing. I have also had a couple times where i think i have become my ""real self"" and have even told people this and said i was hiding myself before."
BipolarReddit,fndfdab,t3_g0yqh5,1586868642.0,"I agree with you and i feel the same way about MLMs like essential oils and supplements that promise to help and eliminate needs for medication. People die every day and in so many cases medication could save them. Not to mention the countless others like me who are now able to lead a productive, comfortable life after decades suffering and struggling to survive without meds.

IMO it's a missed opportunity because a lot can be gained by thinking critically about mental health systems and treatments as a whole, but dismissing science and sound research methods is a waste of that critical thinking. There will always be tons of stories about terrible experiences with meds. Part of the reason is, if im doing well, I'm not going to post things online that are scandalous or dramatic enough for a group like this one. I go about my life. That's the point. 

But all that being said, this is a free speech issue, and unfortunately there is nothing that can be done. It opens up too much of a threat - who decides what's allowed and not allowed? Censorship is a hallmark of oppression and i am glad to be able to communicate and consume media freely"

The receptionist sounds like they may just be a jerk, so no need to worry about a jerk acting like a jerk. The doctor may know that your insurance changing will have implications for you in terms of what they can prescribe, for example mine used to have to order a specific dosage for me to cut in half instead of using 1.5 of a smaller dosage which the insurance would not cover. 

If you want it to be a little less strange, you could try asking next time the doc mentions your insurance something like ""yes that is my insurance now, do you think that will change what i can take?"" Or something to that effect. That way you are inviting them to explain rather than being left to try and guess why they are doing it.

bipolar2,fkttmhu,t3_fkile5,1584534210.0,"Probably not the answer you are looking for, but i lost 30 lbs of medication- related weight gain by learning to balance my meals. If you havent gained weight yet, great - using this method will help prevent it. If you have, this will help you lose it in a more sustainable way.

Balanced meals keep you full much longer. You can use this [hand portion diagram ](https://scontent.fewr1-4.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/53359593_1019320618251339_1195054773003354112_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=uBVkcQhWcB4AX_XIxP3&_nc_ht=scontent.fewr1-4.fna&_nc_tp=14&oh=c7f0df92cd5cc7670d9a7741e39e5079&oe=5E98D295) as a guide. For every meal, try to have: a palm sized portion of protein, a cupped hand of carbs, a fist size of veggies, and a thumb of fats. If that is too small, scale up but keep the balance the same (for me i do 1.5 of each. For men they say 2). When you are first starting i would worry less about decreasing quantity and more about keeping the balance, i.e. if i want to chow down on some noodles that means also the right amount of protein and veggies.

It's annoying because everyone says diet and exercise and it doesn't seem like it is possible to stick with it or that it will work, but im telling you it does. It's a long and gradual road but over time it works. Good luck."
BipolarReddit,feyhruz,t3_eqsi55,1579445758.0,"Yes, i used to feel like this all the time. Then last spring, after a lifetime of trouble coping and 16 years in various forms of treatment that never seemed to stick, i experienced stability for a couple of months. The only reason it didn't continue is i asked my psychiatrist to take me off of one med. That was a mistake but im slowly coming back from it. 

Once you experience it, even for a short time, the highs and lows never feel the same again because you know what *can* happen and you know your current suffering isnt set in stone. 

For me it just felt like an uneventful, steady life one day at a time. Im almost back there now and i hope you can experience it too. They always say it's all temporary, im here to tell you it's not just bs. You can and will get better. You have to fight 💜"

The thing is, it doesn't really matter at this stage what they are calling it - what matters is finding what is going to work for you. All a psychiatrist can do is make the best observation possible and test different approaches until they find something that works. 

In my case i was taking an SSRI for depression and anxiety, then my psychiatrist started to suspect that there may be a hypomanic element to my experience. So she had me try lamictal and it made me feel better than i ever have. Voila, diagnosis.

BipolarReddit,f97smmc,t1_f95t2s2,1575169757.0,It's probably normal to a certain extent. A lot of psychiatric issues are only issues when they rise to the level of significantly interfering with your life. Anxiety is a good example. All people have anxiety. Only some have anxiety to the extent that it becomes a disorder.
BipolarReddit,f97gd81,t1_f95yehe,1575165226.0,"I think most people probably have it but not to the point where you cant hear yourself think and cant sleep without meds. Its funny though,  celexa was the first rx i took and it pushed me into mania but two days later my head was quiet and stayed that way for years."
BipolarReddit,f9563j0,t3_e3t4hz,1575120004.0,"Food, exercise, and sleep. Everyone will tell you they are important and you should listen. I didn't until i was in my 30s and now it's working so well i wish i would have listened sooner"
ptsd,f86p9rs,t3_dz4m9b,1574303649.0,"Wonderful!! And good job continuing on and trying new things, that is a huge accomplishment itself"
BipolarReddit,f84mcw0,t1_f83xf83,1574254411.0,I did a lot of stupid things before my diagnosis and the most serious one almost led to me falling off of a 20 story roof. Please do consider going to the hospital. They can help you get your meds right. You don't have to tell them anything you don't want to. It's not worth the risk of dying
ptsd,f7xz83u,t1_f7x1vtg,1574081462.0,"This. Your PTSD is not the problem in this situation. Anyone would be upset in your shoes. Your fiance is saying and doing things with full knowledge that they are hurtful, and the fact that he says you drive him to it shows that hurtful is what he is aiming for. I haven't seen anyone else say this so I will.... you can do better. Leave him."
bipolar2,f6i0ft6,t3_dr7nvg,1572869438.0,"Yes! Happy for you in your stability. I think it's a very good thing to give yourself room to accept your body. 

When you are ready, keep in the back of your mind that diet and exercise can make you feel even better. I put on a lot of weight over time but want you to know I later changed my diet and exercise in the interest of my mental health and the weight came off as a result."

bipolar2,f69ugfd,t1_f68ysr9,1572747615.0,My life before lamictal in a nutshell
bipolar2,f607sz3,t1_f5zez7b,1572608927.0,"If you are the type that likes alone/ quiet time,  data entry is another option through a temp agency. You don't need any credentials and you can usually work with headphones on."
bipolar2,f6076kn,t1_f4obcef,1572608245.0,Did you get to try it yet? I can relate so much to your post i had to come back and see how you were doing
bipolar2,f4kocem,t3_dkvweo,1571655308.0,"You can do this. If you can get out of the late night study habit you will be better off - if you are not sleeping enough then the extra hours of studying are not helping. 

I used to read my notes into a tape recorder and listen through my headphones while doing chores, walking places, etc. If you have a longer commute you could listen then. For me it was extremely effective."
BipolarReddit,f4g4sqv,t3_dkcxi1,1571577581.0,Good luck. Getting the right diagnosis and getting on mood stabilizers is the best thing that ever happened to me. It takes time to get it right but it sounds like you are on the right path. 💜
