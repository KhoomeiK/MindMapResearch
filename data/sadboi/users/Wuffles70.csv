If I've understood your question correctly, it sounds like you're trying to narrow down what kind of dysphoria the poster above experiences. It might help you to know that some people draw a verbal distinction between different kinds of dysphoria (e.g. body dysmorphia, social dysmorphia). Different kinds of dysmorphia can also fluctuate at different times in life depending in things like stress levels or life events. There are also some trans people who do not meet the criteria for a medical diagnosis for gender dysphoria but who feel much happier and more fulfilled socially when they don't try to present as their assigned gender. 

Dysphoria has a habit of taking over the conversation but I think there's a lot to be said for taking the focus off that aspect of the trans experience. I can't do anything about whether or not someone feels dysphoria but I am a part of the environment trans people move through, you know? So I prefer to think about what a happy trans person looks like and what kind of environment they need in order to have a fair shot at that.

See, this is why I haven't got round to watching that Contrapoints video yet. She is excellent at waxing philosophical about issues but there is actual research about trauma and PTSD that, culturally, we're not super keen on educating ourselves on but which really cut down on this kind of navelgazing about abstracts until everyone is too bored of the conversation to think practically about what we actually could do better. 

If you understand what a trigger actually is and what conditions can be triggered by media, it's actually not that deep, Jeremy. Yes, you can be triggered by just about anything but not everyone can be triggered - in order to have that kind of compulsive or instantaneous reaction to content, there generally needs to be some kind of condition which involves triggers present. While a lot of PTSD research is combat focused, you can still look up the most common causes and use your common sense, the same way journalists use common sense when reporting on suicides when they know what effect specifying the method has on public health. It's the same for eating disorders - shows like *Supersize vs Superskinny* have a following of viewers who watch compulsively for very obvious reasons and TV producers have professional standards like anyone else. It's not ""cancel culture"" to expect them to hold themselves to those standards.

I, like the VAST, VAST majority of people with PTSD, take responsibility for my triggers (including the weird ones) and have made the choice to just not watch while this particular incident is still playing out. I also agree with OP that this is a really teachable moment. That said, since PTSD from sexual assault is really goddamn common, GNC people are statistically more likely to be targeted by predators from a young age and minimising your trauma is so common it's practically a feature of PTSD... Maybe, just maybe we could stop equivocating taking offence with something that amounts to a public health risk for more vulnerable viewers and instead focus on what pragmatic changes producers of Drag Race can take to limit that? At the very least, they could make the effort to signpost viewers to services they can access in their area.

ptsd,fg39shn,t3_ewmv6o,1580475542.0,"I'm still relatively new in my recovery so a good chunk of this is above my pay grade but I think it's worth pointing out that trauma itself is not the thing that gives you PTSD. If that were the case, everyone who went through a trauma would end up getting diagnosed and that's just not the case. Your perception of the trauma matters a great deal: whether or not you were in a position to take agency over the situation, and therefore the trauma, by getting away or fighting back. Whether you felt able to talk about it with anyone or felt silenced by shame or the people around you being unavailable. Whether your trauma physically hurt or left you with a lasting injury can also affect whether you go on to develop PTSD.

I can absolutely see how what your therapist said would make you feel this way but a specific type of trauma potentially not being a factor does not change the validity of your PTSD or triggers. People have got PTSD from hearing about a loved one being in a terrible accident or from being in a situation where they believed they were in danger, even when there was no point where their physical safety was at risk - and, to a certain extent, it doesn't really matter how a person was traumatised. It matters that they have trauma and need to heal. Your PTSD is here and it is, in itself, evidence that a trauma took place and, from the sound of it, you did not have the emotional space or safety to work through whatever it was. It might not be what you suspect it is or it might be that, over time, a memory returns and you get to know you were right but I would encourage you not to chase those memories.

>!2) You can really do a number on yourself trying to force yourself to remember something before you are ready.!<

>!3) I was, in some ways, trying to figure it out because I felt like my trauma would be less valid if he had not hurt me that way. I wanted to try to justify why I felt so awful and hung up on it when the stuff I do remember... is pretty bad. I just normalised it because I was young and growing up with it. !<

>!I was talked about and treated like a possession he could hold onto as long as he wanted for years and, in a lot of ways, that bit fucked me up way more than whether or not he eventually managed to escalate to the point to sexual assault.  I felt like I didn't have a future, that rape was inevitable, that I would be hurt if I fought back and that my body did not belong to me - that's the part that gave me PTSD. At this point, if a memory came back that confirmed my suspicions that he sexually assaulted me, I would have really conflicted feelings about it. On the one hand, it's something I wanted for a very long time - to know so I could feel like I have ownership over my body. On the other,  I now know that my trauma is valid either way and I am in charge of my body, even if it doesn't feel like it a lot of the time. Finding out I'd been sexually assaulted would, in some ways, just be another thing to work through at this point.!<

I would encourage you to sit with the idea that ""only"" verbal and psychological abuse is actually pretty fucking valid in and of itself. You had a developing brain and people who were supposed to love, guide and shape you chose to take advantage of that.

There is a lot to do before either of us know we are even good candidates. EDMR can be lifechanging and, while I am not a good candidate, the nature of your trauma implies to me that you probably are. 

So that's step one. Step two would be learning the skills necessary to manage your PTSD symptoms when they come up. Your dog can be taught to perform DPT but they can't ground you FOR you, you know? You need to be well enough to collaborate with them and, more importantly, you're going to be owner training. You need to be able to take them into public spaces and remain calm in order to train them.

PTSD dogs are AMAZING for symptom mitigation but the irony is, you need the skills to help manage your condition under your belt before you even start. Unfortunately, people are also arseholes and if your PTSD mostly manifests as panic symptoms, it's very easy to accidentally train a SDIT to be reactive to people and wash them.

Very long story short, I recommend taking a BIIIIG step back in terms of acquiring a service dog but what could help your recovery and set you up for success if you end up training a service dog is volunteering at a shelter. Meet lots of different kinds of dogs, try to get some experience with training and give your therapy time to take effect. I know it's hard as hell but nothing comes quickly with trauma recovery."
illnessfakers,fb35c1o,t1_fb1sdkq,1576464615.0,"I don't feel that's particularly accurate. ICD is the only organisation that officially recognises C-PTSD just yet and diagnosing it is significantly more complicated than it is for PTSD. Living with C-PTSD seems pretty chaotic in comparison to PTSD, especially when you take into account the potential for retraumatisation alongside insecure relationships and living arrangements. It's very hard to get a diagnosis and, while treatments developed in the last decade or so such as EMDR make the concept of curing PTSD feasible, they are often based on focusing on a single event i.e. being assaulted or being in an accident, not the kind of trauma that results in C-PTSD. 

I get that it is frustrating when everyone is suddenly claiming a particular condition. That said, when one condition has the potential to be treatable and the other not only does not but also lends itself to behaviour erratic enough to get you mistakenly diagnosed with BPD, it feels a bit unkind to downplay that distinction."

That said, I thought she had genuinely been diagnosed with PNES? The causes of that are psychological in nature so the idea that she has been through some kind of trauma is not unrealistic. Due to the fact that C-PTSD is not yet in the DSM and there is no agreed upon diagnostic criteria, a lot of survivors also use the term to draw a distinction between a reaction to a repeated dynamic they could not escape and a one-off event such as a car crash. On the whole, they are not being dishonest; they just want trauma-based treatment that is geared more towards the kinds of symptoms you get from being exposed to trauma over an extended period of time. It's one of those areas of medicine where the patients are explaining their personal experiences, their therapists are writing something else as the official diagnosis on paperwork so insurance will still cover it, everyone is saying that treatments for mood and personality disorders do not cut it... and at some point the medical establishment will come up with more concrete diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines. 

Until then, Ren isn't particularly unusual for claiming to have C-PTSD without a psych rubber-stamping it. Right now, that fact just serves to demonstrate how poorly equipped we are to deal with people who have been through persistent, inescapable trauma."

It sounds like your treatment is starting to work, to be honest. Don't get me wrong, I know it is horrendous. My psych is making me do daily yoga and more often than not, I cry or get incredibly angry because how **dare** they tell me to do anything with my body, even if it is good for me, aaaah. It definitely brings things to the surface but, when that happens, you have an opportunity to remind yourself that your body is communicating with you.

You've only been away from your ex-husband for seven months - in terms of your recovery, it makes sense that you would still be wrapping your head around things and running into new symptoms and intense experiences.

If so, you can ask for reasonable accommodation.

Nothing productive is going to come out of asking you when you are in a situation where you cannot reasonably assess risk.

Also, this is unacceptable. I know he is your boss and strongly recommend you tread carefully but maybe you could print out some well-chosen articles on the neurobiology of PTSD? While I am sure the majority of the time you are a rational person and a good employee, the biological process involved is arguably closer to a brain injury than mental illness. Either way, it qualifies as a disability and scolding you for not being cheerful about it is worse than useless.

I know you want this girl to validate how you were feeling but I would honestly let that one go. She might hold a grudge, she might not but either way she's probably not going to give you what you're looking for and, honestly, she sounds like a crap place to look for that. You know you have PTSD and your triggers are valid but, ultimately, it's unlikely that she'll see your illness as her responsibility, you know? And you probably wouldn't enjoy the outcome if she did! Get that love and validation from someone you hold in higher regard, maybe a friend or loved one? This girl honestly sounds like someone who should not get a window into your private life.

Oh, wow, I hope those people are not your friends.

I'm really sorry your sexual trauma came before you were able to see signs of your identity without that experience hanging over it. If it helps, there are some fairly good studies that suggest that if you are a gay man, it has way more to do with the number of older sisters you have than whether or not you have encountered trauma. It's harder to find information that directly relates to you if you are AFAB (or are anything other than gay or binary trans... sigh) but there are a lot of little things about our brain structure, level of instances of left-handedness, quirks in our instinctive startle response and inner ear function etc on a statistical level that realistically are not something an LGBT person could consciously perform. Collectively, it builds a picture that suggests a pretty strong biological component that would predate any of your experiences. Sexual trauma affects your development in all kinds of ways but it's very nuanced and there doesn't seem to be any causal link with sexual orientation on a statistical level. 

On a much more personal level, I think it's kind of silly to *expect* trauma survivors to delve into this kind of thing - we have more than enough on our plates working through the stuff that is actively disrupting our lives and it's perfectly acceptable to take an ""if it isn't broken..."" attitude to things if they don't bother us, even if the curious or bigoted people in our lives would prefer it if we wrap it up neatly and put a bow on it for them. They're simply not entitled to that but I think it takes a lot of strength to get to the point where you can tell people to just stop asking inane and uncompassionate questions. We don't have to tolerate it but I can see how people end up feeling like they can't push back. 

&#x200B;

> It’s great to hear that from you because I’ve been hearing a lot of “everyone I know that’s lgbtqia+ has been through a lot of trauma, how do we know that’s not what causes their sexuality/gender identity, etc” and it makes me want to scream because it’s hella rude and people can’t seem to understand why.

I don't know if you wanted a take but mine is ""You literally just admitted that LGBT people experience a disproportionate amount of trauma and instead of considering how we could help make their lives better, you're choosing to ask inane questions about their sex lives and gender. That is the definition of an uncompassionate response and I don't know why you'd think I'd want to talk about my experiences with you when you are already othering people like me."" 

I am a lot less sweet than many people in this subreddit(!) and I'm fine with being a bit combative about it but you could also always just... reflect the uncomfortable feeling they generate back to them and let them experience how awkward it is without you socially buffering them. Rhetorically ask why they would think you would want to talk about something so painful with them when they've clearly already drawn their own conclusions, let their question hang in the air for a second or two and say ""... Huh"" before walking away, pointedly downgrade the conversation to a discussion about the weather etc. It's really hard, especially when your trauma is telling you you will be at risk if you don't people please but if someone is being that crappy, it's OK to allow them to see that their actions have consequences and it affects your relationship with them."
CPTSD,f1p0k22,t1_f1ocy06,1569668599.0,"> Being told ""you don't need to dig"" might be helpful to some but may be damaging to others; we need to figure it out for ourselves. Some of us DO need to dig. 

I think being told you need to dig can be as damaging as being told you don't have to, to be honest. It's not always easy to tell if someone is in denial or has already gone as far as they need to go in terms of self-examination and my feeling is that it's up to that person and their therapist to figure it out. 

My objection is that a lot of communities who do activism based around sexuality (LGBT, kink, ace, pan etc) will often myth bust the idea that the preference or orientation comes about due to trauma... and then they don't really comment further. Meanwhile, those of us who have gone through sexual trauma during our childhood development have to find an equilibrium somewhere and it can be really disheartening for that to be the only time trauma is mentioned. I don't feel thrown under the bus, per se, but I worked really hard to get to a point where I authentically enjoy the things I enjoy and feel confident saying no to the other stuff. It would be nice if these communities occasionally acknowledged that endpoint as a possibility, or spread a little awareness as to what you can do to be supportive of a sexual partner who has a history of sexual trauma. It would have saved me quite a lot of heartache back when I was figuring things out."

It's not the same thing but my NB partner has recently started exploring what transitioning closer to the opposite gender to their assigned sex would look like for them and it's really made me reconsider what is important to me within my relationship. I associate some of the things they are exploring with my trauma and would never, ever want them to slow down or repress themselves on my account but, equally... we've been together 8 years. That relationship isn't about to evaporate over them wanting to explore the ways their gender identity might impact how they approach their sexuality. It's interesting seeing that potential source of tension on the horizon and feeling this unthreatened by it because it just confirms to me that I don't see it as a threat to our intimate relationship and, if we need to look for some non-traditional relationship styles to make sure everyone is happy sexually, that's probably not as big a deal as I was raised to believe.

Ace people, as you rightly point out, are not lacking human connection. It's OK to look for a structure in your interpersonal relationships that works for you, not against you, especially if you have a condition that means how you fundamentally approach intimacy is going to be a little different. I know my ideal future does not involve kids, who cares if I go a little further off-piste?

Not trying to tell you how to live your life because I can absolutely see how this would be upsetting and destabilising... but I think we are taught to put a lot of pressure on ourselves to measure the validity of our relationships by how long they last. The reality is there are a lot of false promises there regarding long-term happiness and security and being stuck in relationships that are bad is how a lot of people's trauma is formed in the first place. Maybe periodically needing to move on is part of your healing process for now? Not trying to assume anything about your current relationship history... but it could be that internalising that you can be safe having a few good years in a healthy, equally-beneficial connection and can weather the storm if it needs to end is necessary before you have enough emotional distance to decide whether longer-term relationships are still an endpoint you want and, if so, what that looks like for you. Maybe the standard relationship formula isn't for you \*and that's OK\*, you know? Fluidity can be its own label and is just as valid as any other sexuality. I think most people are more fluid than they care to admit because, as you rightly point out, it can feel upsetting to feel like you're in flux all the time.

I ended up blogging a fair bit about my own relationship and deleted it because it got pretty irrelevant but the gist was, sometimes queer problems are best resolved using queer solutions. Maybe your ideal long term relationship separates sex from the rest of the equation entirely? Or involves multiple partners who can provide each other with different forms of intimacy in those times when that is not something it would be healthy for you to try to provide? Societally, we tend to conflate sex and intimacy and romance with family but there's no law that says you can't try out a format that gives you more room for sexual fluidity and periods of touch avoidance whilst still being able to participate and exchange love in other ways.

I'm really not trying to provide a magic solution or force you to feel OK with this because this is your journey but I would like to encourage you to think about why you seem to think your \[true\] sexuality is, or should be, a static endpoint you need to reach. I don't see anything in the situation you describe here that I would necessarily consider a dealbreaker if I came across it in someone who communicated clearly and I otherwise had a strong connection with. It certainly doesn't make you unlovable or unworthy of connection with other people.

A diagnosis of PTSD can technically only be made a month after the incident. A very simplistic explanation if what makes it a disorder is that you experience the symptoms that come with processing trauma... whilst not acually processing the trauma and end up stuck in a loop. It takes a little while to figure out whether or not the patient's symptoms are helping them with working through the trauma, hence the (very arbitrary) time limit. 

What OP is experiencing right now is an extremely natural reaction to trauma and, while it is a horrible thing to experience, it is your brain's way of sifting through what happened and trying to process it. Like the feeling grief after a death, it doesn't need a diagnosis because, whilst painful, it is a very typical and human response to an incredibly painful experience. It is as intense, frightening and worthy of respect and compassion as PTSD but there is no way of knowing, in the immediate aftermath of the attack, whether or not she will struggle to process the trauma in that way and go on to develop PTSD. I sincerely hope not and their symptoms start to alleviate as soon as possible. 

Right now, the focus should be on taking the symptoms as they come and helping her work through them without worrying too hard about categorizing or labelling the experience. A close friend of mine just started EMDR and that can be incredibly helpful if OP doesn't find that the counselling they are currently getting is helping to slowly desensitize the memories... but, while it is a life changing experience, there is a route to recovery. Being assaulted does not necessarily make you sick, it simply means you need and deserve a lot of love and support. 

I hope you find your own kind of normal and peace soon, Marshmallow09er. If you don't, some of the PTSD groups on here are really good for finding resources and getting a bit of extra support between sessions. I love the /r/cptsd crowd but my trauma went down a little differently and requires a slightly different approach so you may find /r/ptsd more helpful if you find you need it. I hope you know in your core that you are valuable. This experience has nothing to do with any part of you, your body or what you did and did not do before, during and after the attack.
