The days when everyone at recess would be stuck at the same place in the game, then that one kid shows up and knows the next step but won’t tell everyone.

Having game guides available at the push of a button is certainly great, but having to push through these challenges all on your own as a kid really felt rewarding once you finally figured it out. I miss that feeling."

What do you call the subgenre of DnB that All Night falls under? It’s been driving me crazy. Obviously DnB subgenres are mainly based around the rhythm of the kick and snare, but the rhythm of All Night doesn’t fall into any of the traditional DnB subgenres. It’s more something along the lines of Ekko and Sidetrack (see “Klaxon”). So... what do you call it? That “kick snare, snare” rhythm isn’t used very often, but I really dig it and wanna search out more of it. I need a name!! 😅"

I was (and still am!) a big fan of Zelda, so Ephixa’s Ocarina of Time Dubstep remixes were some of my favorite songs at the time. Watching those along with countless Minecraft videos that used Monstercat releases (i.e., Skydoesminecraft with Airwaves and Renegade not unlike u/swolmart in this thread lol) kinda just drew me into the label. I first got into the label in I wanna say April or May of 2012, and I haven’t looked back since. 

It wasn’t long after that point that Monstercat songs were basically being used EVERYWHERE in gaming videos across YouTube so I don’t think I would have been able to escape the clutches of this label even if I tried LOL

It’s definitely really sad to see them go, because it was always fun using the numbers to see how releases would line up in the coming days, and really seeing any staple part of the label changing is going to be shocking.

However, these reasons Mike stated here really make a lot of sense and definitely help me accept the change more easily. If this means releases will become even more streamlined and the chances for “unscheduled” releases (i.e, Wednesday, Saturday or Sunday) becomes greater then I’m all for it!

Monstercat,fqg096u,t1_fqfhu8s,1589335251.0,"As one of those people... I like to embrace change because it’s important for the label’s longevity, but at the same time... can you really blame us? If you’ve been with this community for so long, seeing them abandon what made it special in the first place can feel almost... trust-breaking? I know, I know, it’s a little over dramatic, but I think it makes enough sense.

As for the “worshipping of older songs”, there are legitimate reasons for this. Obviously nostalgia will factor into it, but really I feel the main reason is that we don’t want people to miss out on these amazing songs. The joy that we’ve felt listening to these older songs over the years is something we want others to feel as well, even if we don’t realize it. Seeing these things that bring us such joy fall into obscurity is disheartening and just plain depressing.

Finally... I’m not trying to be accusatory here, but... why do you feel the need to point out things like this as if it‘s a bad thing? Is it bad that people enjoy things that you missed out on? I’m not directing this towards specially you, but rather everyone who gets upset about there being so many people who look back fondly on the early years of the label. Why is it such a crime to enjoy these older songs and want to share them with new listeners? I’ve never understood this estranged divide between old and new listeners..."

Infected Mushroom have released two albums on Monstercat, Head of NASA & The 2 Amish Boys and More Than Just A Name. Both are their typical Psytrance kinda stuff, although Head of NASA has a little more variety. Both are fantastic in my opinion!

Laura Brehm has had a few features here and there over the last few years. Losing You with Ephixa, Universe with Anevo, Solace with Feint and Changed with CloudNone.

Tristam hasn’t really released much at all over the last few years, but that’s because he’s got an album coming soon, so keep an eye out for that. He did release “Questions” here on Monstercat in 2018, as well as “Bone Dry” in 2017.
