Both families have babies and were pretty certain they had the virus too but they are more than fine, were barely affected.

Anyway back in March we were very cognizant of our shared nanny and let her know she could stop coming and still be paid but she insisted she would miss the babies so we all agreed to be cautious especially bc she lives with elder parents (ages 80+) and had so much to lose really.

Well, when we got sick, she got sick too ‚Äî we insisted a couple weeks ago that she get tested for antibodies. She brought her parents with her. They ALL tested positive. Her parents never even felt sick! Her mom went to a rehab facility in early-mid March so we are thinking she might have been our patient zero.

Anyway I thought it was great news that they never even felt sick despite being over 80. I wonder if there is merit to the idea that prior exposure to other common cold coronaviruses could shield you!?ü§î"

Fewer than 6% of the transmissions have been in warmer climates further south, they wrote.

‚ÄúBased on the current data on the spread of [SARS-CoV-2], we hypothesize that the lower number of cases in tropical countries might be due to warm humid conditions, under which the spread of the virus might be slower as has been observed for other viruses,‚Äù they wrote.

In the US, ‚Äúthe outbreak also shows a north-south divide,‚Äù with higher incidence in northern states, they wrote. The outliers are Oregon, with fewer than 200 cases, and Louisiana, where, as of March 22, approximately 1,000 had been reported."

The Economist did a lot of this reporting, as well as NYTimes, and I do believe it‚Äôs an important metric. HOWEVER: (1) both publications cherry picked New York, New Jersey and a couple of other states, as well as other countries, where the excess deaths illustrated the story they were telling - in fact in states like Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and more, deaths were BELOW average in the week ending 4/28; (2) they are not considering deaths due to strained health care systems in places like NY & NJ, deaths caused by fear of the disease (which may have led people to eschew medical care), and even deaths caused by policies aimed at curtailing the epidemic; and (3) while it‚Äôs not entirely valid to think about the people who ‚Äúwould have died anyway‚Äù there is something to be said about considering over the course of the *year* how many people would have died *by December* - excess deaths have also been looked at on a calendar year basis.

Death is not good news. But it IS good news that while in plain numbers it might appear that the virus is super deadly and deaths are in huge excess as a result - with context it is exactly what we here (and even Lockdown Skeptics) have been saying all along.

1. Social distancing efforts lead to decrease in cases, continuing to drive down the Re for each state - *soon every state will be under 1!* Under 1 = virus eventually dies out on its own ‚Äî> [rt.live](http://rt.live) 
2. Increase in testing availability to limit spreading (save for those asymptomatic cases) + identify how widespread the virus is (calculating how truly low the death rate is + how close we actually might be to herd immunity, if high - not necessarily likely but possible)
3. Contact tracing + isolation to limit spreading (companies like Salesforce, Apple, Samsung, Facebook, Fitbit are working on the technology) - [salesforce ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/new-york-city-partners-with-salesforce-on-coronavirus-contact-tracing-program-mayor-says.html) 
4. Summer‚Äôs heat and typical summer behavior slowing down the virus in the northern hemisphere

7. Wearing masks in public for several months + other public health influenced measures (continued curbside pickup, takeout, social distancing) + continued heightened hygiene

9. People still being wary of the virus so naturally staying home a bit more, washing hands, wearing masks, staying distant

‚Ä¢ These deletions also weaken the ability of the virus to fight the host's immune system

Until now, because of a scarcity of test kits, only people showing symptoms of COVID-19, essential workers and those in institutional settings such as nursing homes could receive a test in Los Angeles.‚Äù
