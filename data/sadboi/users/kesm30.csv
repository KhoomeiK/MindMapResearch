Both families have babies and were pretty certain they had the virus too but they are more than fine, were barely affected.

Anyway back in March we were very cognizant of our shared nanny and let her know she could stop coming and still be paid but she insisted she would miss the babies so we all agreed to be cautious especially bc she lives with elder parents (ages 80+) and had so much to lose really.

Well, when we got sick, she got sick too — we insisted a couple weeks ago that she get tested for antibodies. She brought her parents with her. They ALL tested positive. Her parents never even felt sick! Her mom went to a rehab facility in early-mid March so we are thinking she might have been our patient zero.

Anyway I thought it was great news that they never even felt sick despite being over 80. I wonder if there is merit to the idea that prior exposure to other common cold coronaviruses could shield you!?🤔"

^^ The MIT researchers found that as of March 22, 90% of the transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 occurred within a temperature range of three to 17 degrees Celsius (37.4 to 62.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and an absolute humidity range of four to nine grams per cubic meter. Fewer than 6% of the transmissions have been in warmer climates further south, they wrote.

“Based on the current data on the spread of [SARS-CoV-2], we hypothesize that the lower number of cases in tropical countries might be due to warm humid conditions, under which the spread of the virus might be slower as has been observed for other viruses,” they wrote.

In the US, “the outbreak also shows a north-south divide,” with higher incidence in northern states, they wrote. The outliers are Oregon, with fewer than 200 cases, and Louisiana, where, as of March 22, approximately 1,000 had been reported."

Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Egypt (and even Greece as far as climate) - you would assume much more devastation given healthcare system, inability to test at scale very quickly, tourism for spread (?) - but nope. 6k deaths projected by August in Mexico for example - and sure maybe their reporting mechanisms are off, but in ALL of those countries? Off by how much? And even tho they have all of this in common? Even southern Italy vs northern...

I think social distancing, lockdowns, masks and many other measures work together to play a role (which is rly why I don’t understand how India hasn’t hit their peak..) but climate and behaviors in those environments are also clearly impactful and I’m rly hoping to be proven right in the next couple months!"

""That will be the same for this one,"" he said. ""My feeling is that this is just going to be like SARS and the world is going to get basically a very bad cold for about five months.""

The Economist did a lot of this reporting, as well as NYTimes, and I do believe it’s an important metric. HOWEVER: (1) both publications cherry picked New York, New Jersey and a couple of other states, as well as other countries, where the excess deaths illustrated the story they were telling - in fact in states like Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and more, deaths were BELOW average in the week ending 4/28; (2) they are not considering deaths due to strained health care systems in places like NY & NJ, deaths caused by fear of the disease (which may have led people to eschew medical care), and even deaths caused by policies aimed at curtailing the epidemic; and (3) while it’s not entirely valid to think about the people who “would have died anyway” there is something to be said about considering over the course of the *year* how many people would have died *by December* - excess deaths have also been looked at on a calendar year basis.

Death is not good news. But it IS good news that while in plain numbers it might appear that the virus is super deadly and deaths are in huge excess as a result - with context it is exactly what we here (and even Lockdown Skeptics) have been saying all along.

In short — it’s a list of all mitigation efforts and possible virus evolution. I’ll post links to news/progress for each as I collect them, and feedback is welcome as it just gets us to a better product that helps with coping.

1. Social distancing efforts lead to decrease in cases, continuing to drive down the Re for each state - *soon every state will be under 1!* Under 1 = virus eventually dies out on its own —> [rt.live](http://rt.live) 
2. Increase in testing availability to limit spreading (save for those asymptomatic cases) + identify how widespread the virus is (calculating how truly low the death rate is + how close we actually might be to herd immunity, if high - not necessarily likely but possible)
3. Contact tracing + isolation to limit spreading (companies like Salesforce, Apple, Samsung, Facebook, Fitbit are working on the technology) - [salesforce ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/new-york-city-partners-with-salesforce-on-coronavirus-contact-tracing-program-mayor-says.html)

“• It was the same mutation seen in the SARS virus in 2003 that marked the virus's changes toward the end of the five-month epidemic

• These deletions also weaken the ability of the virus to fight the host's immune system

• It's the first example of this mutation, but the researchers say that as sequencing expands, similar deletions could be detected elsewhere”

While I saw a few articles from yesterday focused on the virus becoming *more contagious*, with very little context or strictly “we don’t know” regarding how more/less fatal it’s becoming — this article provided a glimmer of hope and wasn’t shy about the potential for optimism. And quotes scientists, cv researchers and studies; so while it is dailymail, it’s also googleable."

It’s still disappointing that we’re not seeing drastic decreases, though - I wish people would wear their masks across the board. Yes, many people are, but we would see soooo many fewer new cases if they would just default to mask wearing. Maybe/hopefully some states are just a bit behind others with this trend. Even more so, maybe/hopefully summer has that huge slowdown effect! 🤞"

Normally I’m quite comforted by the good news thread and even contribute to it regularly - but sometimes all it takes is one article or headline to send me spiraling.

I know we’ve seen similar headlines here but i feel like they keep getting more and more optimistic with regards to the timeline. This one says the *beginning* of June. I have a feeling they are just SO confident that they have just a couple of markers they’re looking for, and once they see them, they’ll immediately go into production mode while awaiting add’l results - I know they’ve mostly said as much.

The main focus of the trials seems to be safety but the scientist says ""as every day goes by, the likelihood of success goes up.""

“The announcement, which makes Los Angeles one of the first major cities in the nation to offer free testing to all its residents, came on the same day that county health officials reported a surge in the number of new COVID-19 cases, which they attributed in part to more widespread testing.

Until now, because of a scarcity of test kits, only people showing symptoms of COVID-19, essential workers and those in institutional settings such as nursing homes could receive a test in Los Angeles.”

My husband got his testing done by his cousin’s girlfriend a few weeks ago and went back today to get the negative result - she hasn’t contracted it either, she also noted a slowdown in patients recently, and she said she’s been surprised at how many spouses of ppl who tested positive are testing negative for antibodies.
