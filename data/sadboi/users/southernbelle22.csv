CPTSD,fqsy49n,t3_gkjg0j,1589623166.0,"I just went through something almost exactly like you. Dated for 4 years, within a day he was a stranger to me. He turned into this completely different person who had no regard for my mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, ptsd). I didn't know who he was. I didn't know this narcissist looking back at me. 

Within a month he was seeing someone else and treating me like I was a piece of garbage. It took a year of (ongoing) therapy, 3 suicide attempts, and 2 weeks in a psych ward to finally free myself of the concept that I had just lost some integral part of my being. I only lost the years I had wasted with someone who didn't really exist. It was freeing to finally say ""I don't miss him."" And mean it. 

I'm doing so much better now. It's been almost a year since we split, and I couldn't be happier with myself. I have become so mentally strong. That's the only thing I can thank him for. I survived without him. You are so strong for being able to say this. ‚ù§Ô∏è make yourself stronger every day!"

Reduction,ff9y0xc,t3_esfmsf,1579723958.0,Unprofessional af. I don't regret my reduction but I am disappointed my doctor didn't listen to me regarding size. I am honestly considering getting another surgery to get the size I want that is proportional to my body. :( definitely get another doctor who will listen to you and won't try to sway your decision!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Women can just not want kids. My favorite line was ""Well you just haven't found a man that will make you want kids. You're young so you have time."" TIME TO WHAT? I said I wanted to be CF since I was 14. That's 16 years I haven't changed my mind. ü§¨ I think all of us could rant about that."

CPTSD,fc1aoa3,t3_efk86a,1577313107.0,"I dealt with the same feelings during my previous relationship. Always questioning myself about everything while he brow beat into me that my feelings didn't matter as much as his and these were all my issues. They were actually my self respect trying to say I shouldn't keep letting this man verbally and mentally abuse me. He broke up with me 6 months ago, and I've been in therapy. It's liberating realizing that my feelings and thoughts matter. Even if just to ME."

mentalhealth,f1sjwqv,t1_f1rkbdm,1569729904.0,"This is everything I could say. I find it somewhat disappointing your support network isn't showing as much support as you need. Maybe try to have a friend come around.

I have personal experience with this as I just got out of a mental institute a week ago after being in for 9 days. This first week I took things slow. Even so far as when I went out in public. Because I was somewhat isolated in the care of the institute I was anxious around the public. Self care. My therapist says even just those mundane tasks like brushing your teeth are self care. You need a support network, don't be afraid to find it. It can be very tough, but everyday I am getting a little better ‚ù§Ô∏è"

It's exactly what my body and I guess fate decided it wanted me to do yesterday. Survive. My therapist made me pinky promise to make it to my appointment next week. I don't want to disappoint her. ‚ù§Ô∏è
TrollXChromosomes,ewsii96,t3_cpx0yj,1565728270.0,"I was in 2 mentally/emotionally, and psychologically abusive relationships where one partner even filmed his threesome. I was a good person before them; I'm still a good person now, just broken. I can't stand being cussed at, I despise the word whatever used in the context of an argument. And I'm so anxious sometimes I become physically ill. I'm depressed and have attempted suicide once. It still affects me and one of these relationships is from over 12 years ago. I can handle the scars on my body, they'll fade with time. But the scars on my soul? They're harder to heal and repair."
