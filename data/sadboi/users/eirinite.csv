IMO, Gaga dropped the ball in a serious way with BTW at the time\*, because FM was so new and addictive to the public at the time. We weren't ready for full on house music, so it seemed like a letdown that lessened her hype. ARTPOP was a return to classic Gaga imo (Imagine it's 2011 again, and Gaga comes back with G.U.Y. as her first single, my body would not have been ready.) but the hype died so people didn't give it the respect it deserved. Jewels n' Drugs and the R. Kelly feature weren't that great, but the rest was solid. 

&#x200B;

* Regarding BTW, now that the dust has settled, it is a pretty good house album, it just wasn't what we wanted at the time. But there was probably never going to be a time for BTW, because after Gaga's reign, we started getting sad pop (Lana del Rey) so it just didn't fit anywhere."

They can't force anyone beyond criminals to work under direct threat of violence in America. But imo religion or politics is the motivation for wanting to work hard at companies that don't care about you, not so much whatever bullshit the company espouses."
wallstreetbets,fkj9tdj,t1_fki6vs0,1584239971.0,"I agree but disagree, for me I'd rather get up every morning knowing that I know, that my co-workers know, that we all know, we don't give a fuck about this job and we only exist to make some rich guy even richer. Instead, I have to be schmoozed on ""the importance of being an absolute rockstar,"" and how ""my presence reflects the core family values of ABC co., because in a way, I'm the face of the company"" when all I did was answer phones and make copies. I'd rather be told, ""Alright, you're only here to do xyz. Wash your ass, dress professionally. Speak when spoken to. Leave when your work is finished.""

Mind numbing office politics arise because there's a guaranteed percentage of people who are like you describe and truly think their position was ordained by God, so everything gets more complicated and competitive than it has to be. Even when you make it clear to these people that this is just a job to you and you're not looking to take their position or make waves, they either don't believe you, or find you unprofessional for not wanting your job to be your life and make it their problem that needs fixing."
DashieXP,fkj75v5,t1_fjcwe9s,1584237966.0,"I think you're right, I'm watching today's SMM after a few months of not watching. I'm halfway through the video and there hasn't been any ""keep it goings"" or yelping with reverb. Less gags too, it actually feels like Dashie is in his groove again, not Hollywood youtube mode.

To the fans who thought all the criticism is just hating, you're wrong. We love Dashie for being loud af and swearing like a mf, but ONLY if he's giving a genuine reaction and not putting on. Even Pewdiepie said a few years back when he was at his most ""loud and randum xD"" is was when he was faking his reaction and giving low effort just to keep the videos going. I don't want to see Dashie yell just to be yelling, I want him to yell only if he's maddeRRR or scardeRRR than a bitch."

theJoeBuddenPodcast,fkhggky,t1_fkh0rad,1584198232.0,"For what it's worth I watched ES because Ak was on there, and I only knew Joe from LAHH (I include the Loiter Squad parody as LAHH too lmao) 

I watched the viral moment w/ Yatchy which led to me becoming a fan, and after Star left, I eventually find my way to the pod.

But I definitely didn't know or care about Joe, I didn't even know he did Pump it Up. But he was the breakout star for sure, first pod I listened to had me dying at work and I was hooked."
stevenuniverse,fkg41t5,t3_fi92pm,1584149420.0,"NGL, while I knew Steven's arc has been leading up to his PTSD, the talk with Priyanka and then Greg coming in triggered the shit out of me. Why is this children's show so perfectly describing what it's like to be traumatized and not know how to function when life is stable. 

He's been a fixer, firefighter and a punching bag his whole life and without that, Steven has no identity and no purpose. **Life doesn't even make sense if there's nothing wrong.** Words cannot begin describe how terrifying it is to feel like that.

Thank you Rebecca, for making this episode."
theJoeBuddenPodcast,fkbg738,t1_fk7vw96,1584032407.0,"Rory isn’t funny? Rory’s fuckery is a perfect compliment to Joe’s fuckery. They don’t call them Pump McNasty for nothing tbh

Mal reactions to things are what makes him funny. idk if Mal gets a lot of jokes off apart from that. He’s not unfunny, but the Irish Pump bring the fuckshit, Parks is the hypebeast and ad-lib guy, and Mal is the straight man reacting to all the wild shit they say."
theJoeBuddenPodcast,fkb37xl,t1_fkah0rc,1584025210.0,"I'm dying 💀 tbh Run was the original Sultan of Sicko for the bubble bath scenes, when will he pass the torch down to Joe? I could watch Pump's House 😭"
