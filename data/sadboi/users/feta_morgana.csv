Only indirect light ,so it was quite dark in that room too.
Every fucking time i babysat there something scary happened.
One time i was in the kitchen, and could suddenly hear a loud babble of voices out of that room.
I called my friend to calm me down, and even she heard it over the phone.
Another time i heard a crashing sound from upstairs and ran up the stairs to the kids room, and saw a Floor lamp shattered in the corner.
The small girl pointed at it from the bed. ""Who did that? Why did the lamp fall down?""
The little boy wispered to me one night when i tucked him in: ""Sometimes when Mommy and Daddy sleep somebody comes in."" 
I asked the father some interested questions about the history of the house, and told me that a famous professor owned the house once . This professor held private meetings in that living room.
Oh and there were rumours about this professor being a pedophile.

The parents didn't seem to realize the tense and evil atmosphere in their house, when i asked about the scary carving on that cupboard f.e. the mother was surprised because she never REALLY  looked at it before."
