I remember that the day before I was telling him about my day, I was very happy becouse I won the dabate that I was prepering myself to for a long time and I just got off my antidepressants so I was feeling proud of myself and I think he just knew that he's done his duty to protect and to care for me, that I'll be Okey when he's gone, that I'm ready for him to rest. I was woken up by my dad the next day, to the news that my best friend died, he had carried him to the balcony becouse it was November I went to him and cried upon his body for couple of hours before my dad had to take me by force to the house.

Couple of months before I was playing with my sister with paint and paper, my dog walked to the pain and stepped onto the paper leaving perfect paw print. When I turned 18 I tattooed it on my ribs, as close to my heart as it was possible. To remind me that because he's gone from my life, he's never really gone from my heart and my mind. I'll love him forever, most of the days I'm excellent but when I randomly think about him I sometimes can't stop crying.
