In my mind, neither of those sound any better than what we are currently doing. I don’t think you realize how many at-risk people there are."

I asked about it and they said they charge the $25 in case they find something while conducting my visit/bloodwork, but if nothing is found they give you a refund. I knew I had high cholesterol (family inherited) and just them finding that, not actually doing anything about it, made them not give me that $25. It pissed me off. They also tried to make me schedule a follow up appointment just to get my lab results and pay another copay instead of just putting my results on 
the online portal. It felt like such a fucking ripoff, and I haven’t had another doctor charge me for an annual visit since. Ugh sorry. I just went on a rant. I’ll excuse myself out."

I’m not necessarily trying to defend her because I wouldn’t defend myself when I inevitably did the same thing in that situation, but as it was happening I was like oh that so would be me. Lol

PMDD,f9eilvx,t3_e4mo5p,1575244725.0,"So sorry you’re dealing with this. I tried everything before finally giving into birth control about a month and a half ago. I’m also on 20 mg of lexapro. 

I’m in the middle of the 2nd pack of the bc, and it’s definitely much better than the first. I told myself I had to at least stick it out for three months, the usual adjustment period according to everything I’ve read. 

I also suffer from generalized anxiety that’s kind of always there but hits me like a ton of bricks immediately after I ovulate every month. PMDD symptoms haven’t completely disappeared, but the major, unbearable anxiety, depression, and everything else that comes during those two weeks has been much easier to manage and just “deal with” than before. 

I will say that the birth control side effects went almost completely away by the end of the first month, and I ended up taking the inactive pills to have a period. By the time I started the second pack I had all of those beginning symptoms all over again so this month I’ll be skipping the sugar pills and going straight to the next month. 

Hang in there!! I hope things get better for you."

My doctor prescribed me propranolol which is actually a a blood pressure medication but it’s used of label for physical symptoms of anxiety. Like a lot of people will use it before public speaking, big meetings, and other stressful situations because if the physical symptoms are calm then the brain doesn’t freak out in response. My doctor said I could take it as often as I needed.  It’s basically a beta blocker, and it seems to work pretty well.
