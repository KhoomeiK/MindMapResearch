BPD,fogq8es,t3_g70ov2,1587755724.0,I feel this so much. Once I got diagnosed my ex always used it against me. I felt worthless and like nobody else would ever love me but now I’m in a really healthy happy relationship with someone who understands my disorder and doesn’t make me feel evil for having it. There are people out there who understand and will love you for who you are and not use your BPD against you. Just keep an open heart :)
