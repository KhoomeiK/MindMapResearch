My stepbrother constantly annoys the living shit out of me when I'm around, and when I'm around my actual dad, I'm lucky to not get yelled at for a day because of his anger issues. My dad overreacts to literally everything, and my stepmom hates when I'm emotional, something I can't control with my depression. Quarantine made things even worse. I've cut myself several times, and tried to choke myself with a wire. Being trapped in 2 houses with these people drives me insane. I haven't been able to see my friends, the online work is worsening my anxiety, I can't see my therapist or get my medication upped. My personality is also so different from everyone else, and my emotional issues so offsetting, that I think I'm going to die alone. The only redeeming quality I possess is being booksmart, but as my stepdad berates me about on a daily basis; I have issues with common sense. No matter how hard I try, I fall on my face.

nosleep,fk2yo62,t3_fg6uxz,1583812463.0,"You too? I had a very similar incident go on at mall near my house. Same fucking store too! I was a custodial worker just trying to make some extra money to pay for my college funds. That day, I noticed that Old Navy was closed off with some yellow tape and with the gate shut. When I had to clean there, another worker had to supervise me while I cleaned up. Both of us were curious about this rule, so when we cleaned the security room, we checked the footage for our own curiosity. It turns out, an employee was working past closing to finish counting money, when suddenly he passed out at the counter. Seconds later the lights went out for a few minutes. When they came back on, the employee recovered, but every mannequin was now turned towards his side of the room, with them getting closer and closer with each passing flicker, until he was laying dead on the floor the last time the lights came back on. Once more, a mannequin was messing with the light switch, in this case, a mannequin wearing jeans and a t-shirt. However, one detail freaked the hell out of us. The employee was dead, faceless on the floor. His face was covering one of the mannequin's blank faces. On the wall, written in blood was my name, and my supervisor's. But, a second later, a line of static rolled across the screen and all evidence was gone. The blood on the wall was erased, the face was back on the now dead employee, but the mannequins remained, since the lights were on. I'm telling you, the mannequins are alive, sentient, they are getting revenge on us for using them as ""dolls."" I warn you, stay away from Old Navy at all costs, especially if they are watching you."
