The same girl in a business studies lesson suggested that the reason we don’t ship fruit and veg on boats is incase pirates steal it, and also asked why we can’t just chop down mountains. 
She was so notoriously stupid that one of our teachers kept a notebook in his desk to write down all the stupid things she said in and he gave her it the day we left."

It’s been about 2 years and while it works amazingly when I actually take it properly, I am awful at taking it properly and so any missed dose and I have this exact experience. I’ve never been able to put it into words and I don’t think you’ll ever understand the feeling unless you’ve experienced it but this description was perfect!"
diabetes_t1,eweopfl,t3_cnq7av,1565331343.0,"Firstly congratulations on the new baby! 

Secondly, your BG monitor is your best friend (right behind your endocrinologist). Regular monitoring and logging of food, BG readings and insulin will really help you find your feet and your endo will be able to help you with any patterns or burning questions you have. 
I’ve personally been terrible with my diabetes control for the past 10 or so years and have found that CGM as others have mentioned has been a total game changer but definitely keep up with the regular finger pricking and set yourself off on the right foot! I’ve also found that talking to others with diabetes has helped me a lot. Joining groups and forums has been really useful since I don’t actually know any other real life specimens. And lastly: remember to take each BG reading at a time, one high or low does not have to ruin the rest of your day or your week! T1 isn’t smooth sailing and no one will ever be the perfect diabetic so just take it as it comes and don’t let it get you down, there is always plenty of help and support out there so please do try to use it. All the best and good luck with everything!

Edit: I also can’t stress enough the importance of site rotation for injecting! I struggle with this one but it can have such an impact on insulin absorption so do try my best. (If anyone is any wiser on this matter than I am please feel free to jump in and spread some wisdom) x"

Effexor,ew8sah7,t1_ew8qei7,1565214403.0,"Yeah so basically she’s said to continue with the 75mg in the morning and 150mg in the evening even while switching from IR to XR, iirc the dose was split originally because of issues around sleeping (although I could be way off, it feels like a lifetime ago now!), so I’ll probably give it a go and see how I get on with the XR because the IR certainly doesn’t have a sedative effect, very much the opposite.
