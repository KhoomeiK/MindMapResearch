I met this guy back in November/December and we originally didn’t have much interest in eachother, slowly but surely we eventually went from being mutual friends to closer friends. I started seeing him often and had opened up to him about a lot of what I was dealing with. He was incredibly reciprocating of my emotional needs and honestly, he made me feel like for once I was “enough” as a person. We went from hanging out and having fun on my birthday to not talking or seeing him for a week. He seems off and I can’t tell if I’m letting my insecurity getting in the way or if he really just doesn’t care anymore. Am I fighting for reasons to care about someone who’s already gone or am I looking for reasons to push him away (I tend to do that with people I deeply care for due to former trauma) 

Forgive me for the spill, I just don’t really know what to think, and when I saw this question I figured someone else may relate"

On one hand I think it’s great that I can understand others and have those complex conversations, but on the other hand it really fuckin sucks sometimes when I have a week like I’ve had I just really can’t deal with the dumb issues my friends have with whoever. It makes me feel so conceited and evil but sometimes I just want to explode on them for acting so hurt over such small things when I feel so burdened by my abuse. It just sucks, it just fucking sucks, and sometimes all you can do is be mad for a few days and then tuck it away somewhere that no one can really be harmed by it.
