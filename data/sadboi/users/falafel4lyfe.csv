mentalhealth,ffysqrn,t3_evx0er,1580354213.0,"Hey man, sorry to hear you're struggling ):   


I was in a similar situation a couple years back. The first thing I want to say is that what you're feeling although scary is most likely not  a ""serious mental illness"" hiding in the recesses of your mind hah. you're experiencing some OCD in terms of obsessive thoughts. On average people have about 48.6 thoughts a minute (70,000 thoughts a day) thought a shit ton and most people don't even realize that they're having them.

consider this, if you're a Basket Ball player and you think about Basket ball all the time, you might start notice people who wear team hats or jerseys, Jordans anything BB related, you're gunna notice that, 'cause ball is life hah. But for me, some one who doesn't give a shit about Basket ball, even if I'm seeing all the same people as you, chances are I'm not going to notice any of those things. 

Now apply this to what's happening now- At some point you thought a thought that creeped you out, say you were walking down the street and you were like ""what if I just jumped in front of that car"" and you're like oh fuck why did I think that. now you start cyclical thinking and you're ruminating on that thought. essentially you scared you're self and gave your self and it became a ""traumatic event"". Now you're brain is like "" shit that was uncomfortable I don't want to think about that ever again it feels weird, it's scary, i don't like it"" - but if I told you what ever you do DONT THINK ABOUT BASKET BALL you're probably going to have a hard time not thinking about basket ball. --- so now you've registered these thoughts (that every one has, but most don't even register it because these thoughts have 0 weight) but because you have a ""traumatic event"" attached to these thoughts, they carry weight, so now you register these uncomfortable thoughts! and just like the guy who loves basket ball, now you see them every where! and the first thing we want to do is push them away. but the more you push them away the more weight they carry in your mind. 

So I started to practice two things. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Mindfulness.   
I applied the CBT by slowly spending time with the thoughts. not pushing them away but letting them float there. I recommend reading Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Teach Yourself Book by Christine Wilding. You need to de sensitize you're self from the thoughts- when you become disinterested in them- they'll begin to pass unnoticed by your mind.   


As for mindfulness it's essentially trying to stay in the moment, noticing your surroundings, the smell of the air, the chill of the wind- as people in the 21st century we are bombarded by so much stimulants we have a hard time being alone with our selves with out music or our phones, so when stress affects our state of being with say, compulsive thoughts, we aren't equipped to deal with it. I'd recommend reading Mindfulness: An Eight-Week Plan for Finding Peace in a Frantic World by Mark Williams and Danny Penman   


you're experiencing some OCD and anxiety and most likely are stressed out and it's affecting your body/mind. Take some time to take care of your self!"

Anxiety,ffe1397,t1_ffe0dqh,1579833965.0,"Although there was a moment when I was like “oh wow, this stuff is really helping” around that month in, part I feels like it was a pretty gradual climb that I just didn’t happen to notice until I was doing things farther and farther outside of my comfort zone.

I was using it for Agoraphobia/panic disorder so what might be “really helping” for me, could be different for some one using it for depression or GAD  or OCD. 

As well I was also practicing a lot of CBT and NLP so I feel like it was a combination of all of them that helped me the most."

I ended up switching to Escitalipram and that got rid of my heart burn."

“I been brain-fried, electrified, infected and injectified,
Vivosectified and fed pesticides,
My face is all cut up
My radar's all shut up
Nurse I need a check-up from the neck up,
I'm Batty
It seems to have no effect doctor
They used and abused me,
Battered and bruised me,
Red wires green wires stuck em' right through me,
So hear my Batty word,
And exercise a little prudence,
When dealing with humans.”"
