Yes, there is severe clinical depression (where someone needs immediate help (usually because they are a imminent harm to themselves or others)), but there are also infinite gradations in between. 

At the end of the day all that matters is that you feel there is something wrong and you would like to improve it. Nobody needs any reason to improve themselves besides the desire to and you can do this at any point in your life no matter how “healthy” you think you are. 

Whether you are or aren’t if you feel like improving yourself, just do it. Get some therapy, learn the techniques of CBT and learn how to examine your own thinking (you’re already on your way). It is always a net positive in the long run."

It is a matter of distribution (in a statistical sense).Half of people are below average and even within that group  there are gradations of unsavoriness. Some are not only undeserving of praise, but deserve ridicule. There are some awful mothers, military personnel, lgbtq people out there as there are in any subset of the population (yes they have issues they need to work out and everyone has a backstory),but it is wholly unfair to include these people in the praise of those who excel at their job.

TLDR: Not everyone in the group is as special (or even a good person for that matter)  as that one amazing example we have socially normalized to praise, yet everyone in the group is given the praise. It is a moral hazard."

When we talk about athletes the schema and preconception in our collective brains is ""the more athletic the better"" aka more athletic = better player. Skill is largely overlooked in sports because skill is not a physical attribute. The most skilled player can often dominate the most athletic player if they have less skill, but we cannot see that in a snapshot with our eyes so it is not our instinctual feeling about the subject.
