cults,fr3s5v2,t3_gllgas,1589864795.0,"The whole name Jehovah is fucked. The ancient Jews’ god’s name was YHWH (Yahweh), but it was considered a sin to say it out loud. To prevent that from happening, the jews took the vowels of the word Edonai/Adonai, meaning “my Lord”, and mashed them with YHWH, making it a basically new word (YeHoWaH). However, a bunch of English protestants with a heavy ass accent tried pronouncing it, and instead of sounding like “Yehowah”, it came out as “Jehovah”. Given how widely popular those protestants were, the pronunciation got super common and it kinda just stuck around. Hence the use of the name “Jehovah”- a messed up version of the name YHWH."

A large number of people in my area are Muslim and I know that one of my friends had to fast with an active ED. I’m pretty sure she tried to divide all of her usual amounts of food evenly before sunrise and after sunset. So she would try and eat a regular breakfast with a lot of fats and protein, CHUG water, and then start her fast at sunrise. To make sure it’s not too much of a strain on your body, try to spend the day relaxing, taking LOTS of naps, watching YouTube, etc. Anything to distract yourself. Then, after sunset, try to eat the amount of food you would normally eat, ie the amount that’s lunch+supper. 

Try to remind yourself that this is only temporary. It’s a hard time but you can get through it. Try to surround yourself with positive people who can support you in recovery, and try to stay away from triggering  content!!!

EatingDisorders,fp3gmm6,t3_gb2e1a,1588278958.0,"Hi! I’d like to start off by saying that not telling my parents as a teen is probably one of my biggest regrets of all time, and I’ve done some preeeeeetty regretful shit. I’d suggest telling them what they need to know, and only going further if you feel like it. Don’t feel pressured to tell them EVERYTHING, but if you want to, and feel like it would help you get it off your chest, go ahead. Mention things like, what the behaviours are, how they can help, and how you would like to get help for it. Expect to get any kind of reaction (hurt, anger, fear, awkwardness), but just know it comes from a place of love: your parents might get scared because they care about you, and would get upset that they didn’t know earlier/you’re in danger. They might get angry because they’re blaming it on themselves, or again, they’re scared. On that note, remind them that it’s not their fault, and reinforce that you CAN get better, that recovery IS possible.

On that note, I would suggest having a few resources on hand to send them. INCREDIBLE websites that helped me with my parents wee NEDIC, NEDA, BEAT, and the Butterfly Foundation. They have pages and pages of information about EDs that can help back you up a bit. Similarly, FEAST-ED is a resource entirely dedicated to parents of kids with EDs, so maybe direct them to that.

Good luck!!!"

I had a TON of “fear foods”, and for a while I only saw food as an occasional thing to keep me alive. Sentimental foods did play a part though, funny enough. With some foods, especially the ones I was scolded for eating as a kid, ended up on the bad list. It gave me the feeling of being a defiant little kid who was rebelling against her parents. But a lot of my comfort foods that my mom would make often ended up on my “good” list. No regard to what the actual food was, just that it made me feel like I was a kid again.

I don’t know where I’m going with this, but now that I’m recovering, my relationship with food is MUCH much better!!"

AMA,fh7oszx,t1_fh76ayx,1581340375.0,"Yes!! So basically, one of two things usually happen for most people, either your metabolism slows or speeds up:

1. In my case, and as for a lot of people, your body is scared you’ll start starving again, so as preparation, it holds onto as much food/weight as possible, for a certain period of time. JaidenAnimations was pretty good at explaining it!!

2. However the other thing I’ve seen is that your metabolism can speed up. With some people, their bodies see food and think, “I need to get through this as fast as possible”. So their bodies will try and digest it&eat a lot to restore all the nutrients missing. This can make it really hard to gain the weight back, and leads to awful side effects like hot flashes at night, etc.

Some people end up dealing with first one, others deal with the second one, sometimes people deal with both, and sometimes people deal with none 🤷‍♀️ It honestly really just depends on your body"
AMA,fh74f6f,t1_fh725tm,1581314746.0,"1. Personally, instead of one big event that set it off, it was more like a ton of little things that piled one on top of another. Eating disorders are biopsychosocial, so it’s a mix of genetics, psychology, and the way you interact with other people!! I have what seems like a family history of mental illness/eating disorders, so the genetics check out. I also have social anxiety and OCD, so anorexia was a way of coping with it. I mean, it was easier to focus on food/eating instead of dealing with how anxious I felt. Anxiety tends to make you feel out of control, so I felt like my body was the only thing I had power over.  Plus, when you’re really hungry, you tend to feel I guess kinda like you’re floating, or you’re on a cloud. I never felt sad, or happy, or angry, or anything, I just felt numb, and at the time I though that was easier than having to deal with my emotions. Don’t get me wrong, it was never a choice though. 

2. Like question one, my choice to recover was honestly a bunch of little events that made me think, “what the fuck am I doing, I can’t live like this”.  For a long time I had been lying to my family, so that was crushing me. I was also losing friends from isolating myself, and I started getting HORRIBLE side effects (heart palpitations, hair growing EVERYWHERE, always cold, etc). I think my biggest moments were probably: 1. The time I had to unclog the toilet in under 30 seconds cause I had clogged it with a ton of food, and my mom was on her way up the stairs. Not a fun time, 10/10 do not recommend. 2. The time I was crying over water cause I was scared the dust on the tap had calories. Yep, I started crying. I can just remember thinking, “this is so fcking pathetic I need help” 😂😂

3. Recovering is probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done before, but I don’t regret a single thing. It’s challenging, because it’s taking away your only coping mechanism. It was quite literally my addiction, in the sense that for a while it was the only way I could deal with my emotions. The hardest parts have gotta be the more “low key” behaviours. Challenging fear foods is a nightmare, and listening to people around you talking about dieting feels like an ancient torture mechanism. It sucks. But the best parts make it worth it. I could never in a million years imagine how AWESOME it is to eat cake, or how nice it is not to have to count calories, or how fun it is to hang out (and actually enjoy it) instead of spending the night exercising. I’d take recovery over having an ED any day.

4. That’s actually a really interesting question, in the sense that it brings up a much larger issue. Bear with me for a second while I go on a bit of a tangent. When it comes to getting better from an ED, a lot of people tend to tell themselves, “Oh, I don’t need help, I’m not that bad cause I only weigh X pounds!” or, “I’m okay because I only throw up once a week”, when in reality, there’s no such thing as “sick enough to get help”. This is also an issue in terms of getting medical care- I’ve had a friend be told by a doctor that she couldn’t POSSIBLY have an eating disorder because she was at a normal weight. Even I’ve been told that, though I was underweight, I didn’t “look anorexic”, so I there was no way I was struggling. 

The point I’m getting to here, is that there’s no way to objectively measure “how bad” someone has it. You can’t tell if someone’s struggling based on their weight, or how often they do certain behaviours. In the end, if someone is having trouble with food, they’re struggling, and they need help!!

5. Thank you so much!! Comments like those mean a lot to me and I really appreciate it:)"
AMA,fh70t8j,t1_fh6yph6,1581311335.0,"Hmm

Honestly I’ve thought about this a lot but I think I’ve narrowed it down. EDs are biopsychosocial, so they’re a combination of genetics, psychology, and the way you interact with other people.

As for the biology part, a few people in my extended family have had EDs, along with other mental illnesses, so yeah, I was kinda doomed from the start 😂😂

For the psychology part, I’ve struggled with really intense social anxiety/OCD since I was really young, so controlling food was my way of coping. I mean, it’s easier to think about food 24/7 than it is to think about how everyone hates you/you might die if you don’t do your rituals, right? It made me feel in control. Plus, when I was hungry, it gave me a “floaty” kind of feeling. When I felt like that, I had no emotions- I never felt happy, never felt sad, never felt angry, etc. I was numb, and to me that was easier to deal with than being in a constant emotional roller coaster. 

When it comes to the social part, that’s more just reinforcement. People telling you, “you’re doing great” or, “keep it up” or, “i’m sOOOO jealous of you” really fucks you up. Plus, when I was struggling with fear foods (aka foods that scare the living shit out of you), people would encourage it. Say I was scared of eating cake- my dad would sometimes say, “Oh, that’s a good thing that you stopped eating cake. It was already a bad food to begin with”. General life advice: don’t say stuff like that 🤷‍♀️"
AMA,fh706s1,t1_fh6znva,1581310795.0,"I’d start off by seeing a GP! They usually have lists of recommended therapists and dietitians in the area, and can also help make sure you didn’t do any damage to your body. I’d say your #1 priority should be therapy, and I’d strongly, strongly suggest a dietitian too, who can help you work towards a less disordered relationship with food!! And just a heads up: If someone treats you differently cause you’re a man, gtfo of there. Same goes with BED- it’s equally as much of an ED, and if anyone says otherwise, then find someone new. Also, try to always remember that, despite what a lot of media says, going on a diet won’t help with BED, it’ll only continue the cycle. Good luck:)"

OCD,fh6cykb,t1_fh5acxn,1581297412.0,"ok so one of them would be my fear of making mistakes, which honestly goes hand in hand with my social anxiety. I’ll convince myself I’ve said something that I didn’t, and then mentally analyze the whole situation to make SURE I didn’t say anything bad. Or if I write an email to say, idk my teacher, then I’ll spend ages and ages reading over it, sending it, unsending it, etc., because I’m scared I accidentally typed something wrong. Same goes for Instagram lol that app is a nightmare for me. I have to refresh my account in certain ways, check over and over again, etc.

For some reason though, that one I’m convinced I’m faking, cause I guess a lot of the time it happens in my head. So when I do the mental stuff, I’ll be like, “did I just force myself to do that?” or, “did i just make up a memory of myself doing the thing?”

another one is also i guess tied to my intense fear of death, where i’ll constantly be ruminating about death and dying and all that. Like there’s not a day that goes by where I don’t think about it. Almost every night I end up being bombarded with thoughts like, “What if I’m dying” or, “How do I know I’m still alive” etc. So I end up doing stuff like trying to force myself to think of other things, or weird behaviours

When I was a lot younger, I had a lot of the more stereotypical OCD obsessions, like symmetry, counting, and harm, but over the years those are barely even noticeable, and I wouldn’t say I struggle with those anymore. I think that’s part of the reason I think I’m faking it?"
OCD,fh4448f,t3_f1bjdv,1581275031.0,"Personally, a lot of my compulsions are mental, so you’d never even notice I have OCD unless you were to really pay attention. I guess my best example as to how it feels would always be that one episode of Spongebob called “Squid’s Day Off”. Random intrusive thoughts pop up, like the Krusty Krab burning down, etc., and Squidward HAS to go check it out, just in case it’s actually burning. For me, a lot of my fears are linked with my social anxiety/fear of death. So for example, I’ll have an intrusive thought about saying the wrong thing, and then spend ages replaying that memory over and over again to mentally “check” everything that happened. Or for example, I used to be so scared of someone I loved dying, so I would have to perform the same mental routine perfectly to “undo” the possibility of them dying, if that makes sense.

When it comes to the stereotypes, I find them amusing. I usually play along and get them talking for a long time, just out of curiosity."

EatingDisorders,fg3rxbl,t3_ewoll4,1580488361.0,"I’m so glad you’re reaching out, you really do care about your brother and you seem like a really amazing sister 💕

Quick disclaimer fist: Try to remind yourself that no matter how tempting it may be, no matter how much you care about him, you can’t fix him. He can only fix himself. You can be the most incredible support in the world, but if he doesn’t want to recover, it’s gonna be incredibly difficult to do anything.

On that note, here’s a few ideas:

• If he’s not seeing a therapist already, help him find one. An amazing resource I really like is PsychologyToday, since you can type in your postal code and filter by topic to find the best therapists for your issue in your area!! I’d also strongly recommend seeing a dietitian if you can, who specializes in EDs.

• Another tip would be to do as much research on EDs as possible. NEDIC, NEDA, and BEAT are some amazing resources that come to mind, and i’d strongly suggest reading as much as you can on them.

• As for in-the-moment support, try to be available to listen, and don’t judge him for what he’s saying. His logic might seem absolutely ridiculous, but please, don’t judge. The deadliest symptom of EDs are shame and silence, so to break that silence is doing a lot of good!!

• Try to avoid talking about things like dieting, weight, calories, etc., as they can be incredibly triggering. Along those lines, try to avoid commenting on what he’s eating or how he looks. I remember for me personally, I had a lot of weird food “rituals”, which always seemed funny/startling to my parents, and they never failed to point them out. That only lead to me eating alone in my room in secret. Things to avoid saying would be, “You look healthy”, or “Are you really gonna eat all that?”, or “Is that all you’re gonna eat?”, or “Wow that’s a lot of junk food”, or things like that. Just try to avoid talking about how they look, even if it’s a compliment, because ED brains can really screw up how you interpret things.

• If you can, avoid saying those things about yourself too in front of him. Try to avoid saying things like, “Oh my god i’m so fat!” or, “wow I ate so much today, gotta burn off those calories” or, “oh my god I just lost XYZ pounds!”.

• Distractions!! If you guys still eat together, maybe watch a movie, play a board game, or even just chat about anything. Whatever gets the focus off of the food. Distractions after supper are key too- maybe hang out for a bit to get his mind off of things?

• The worst thing you could possibly do is say something like, “if you don’t put in more effort/if you don’t eat/if you keep purging/if you don’t get better, I’ll stop talking to you”

• This is the most important one, above all else: Look after yourself. Supporting someone with an eating disorder is EXHAUSTING, so always take care of yourself, always put your OWN health first, and if you feel like you’re having trouble, go see a therapist too. It’s like those oxygen masks on airplanes. They always tell you to put on your own mask before you put on your kids’ masks. Why? Because if you try to save your kids first, you run the risk of passing out from lack of oxygen, and suddenly both you and your kids are dead. But if you put on your mask, you’ll have enough air to help your kids!! Same goes for the cliché phrase- don’t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. It’s hard seeing someone with an ED struggle, and it’s amazing that you want to support your brother, but your own mental/physical health is your first priority"

not to bombard you with questions, i’m just genuinely really curious, do any of your friends/family know about your diagnosis? how did they react?

what’s it like dealing with the stigma surrounding aspd? i mean i have a few mental illnesses myself, but the stigma around those ones in particular are NOTHING compared to cluster b disorders. have you ever gotten any hurtful comments?

on that note, if you could press a button and not have aspd, would you?
