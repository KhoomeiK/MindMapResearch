Maybe even show her some of the responses here. Growing is part of maturing and being a better person. Her logic suggests that there should be no black or brown children, no disabled children, no poor children because they could experience hardships, but anybody could experience hard things and you shouldn't give up on someone for that. It says that white people shouldn't deal with black/brown people if they might have to consider any hardships they face. It says mixed race children are a burden to white parents.

You are dedicated and loving and that's amazing and she (whether or not she realises it??) is one of the people who will make life hard for us right now. Anyway, even though it can be really hard being a brown/black kid in a society like this, we will fight to be able to do anything white people can do 🤷🏽‍♀️ She should know that you shouldn't give up on a life because it's hard sometimes."

You could use initial chapters to introduce more than one of them, the people who know each other, together. Or do they end up on island all coming from the same place? You could mention short encounters between characters if, for example, they were on a cruise ship together that later got wrecked. If it's in first person it'd be easier to describe seeing all these different people doing different things. Maybe talk about these different groups of people, focusing on the characters you need and introducing more individually as time goes on.
