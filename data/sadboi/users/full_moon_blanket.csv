casualiama,fh7ie4g,t1_fh7i5za,1581333373.0,"That's so awesome. I made some of my best friends thru the bowling community. Had some of the best times of my life thus far as well. 

I saw Tommy's most recent 300 on TV. He is my favorite as well. His streak of 300s in the Weber Cup is insane, he is just a monster all around. I've never met him but Mike Wolfe runs a pro shop here in Louisville, and Tommy is known to pass thru the city. Several friends have met him, he seems super genuine. 

One of my fellow Louisville bowlers who is probably 10 years older than me made his PBA debut last year with Sean Rash in a doubles tournament against Jason Belmonte and someone else...I forget at the second. They won. So surreal to me to see someone I looked up to in leagues as a kid, sweeping PBA matches lol. 

Glad I stumbled across your post. I love talking about bowling lol. Where in the US are you? Did you consider collegiate bowling?"
casualiama,fh7hzdb,t1_fh7hrkw,1581332803.0,"Kentucky. State champs 2010 haha. 

My higher series' weren't sanctioned, I spent much more time bowling outside of leagues and tournaments than in them, but I had a good streak in my early high school years bowling the Pepsi Tournament and various KY and USBC tournament qualifiers. I was always in it for the fun and eventually burned out. Havent thrown a ball in 7 years. I am really interested in getting back into it though. 

High series unsanctioned was 760-something. It's been so long I forget sadly. Sanctioned probably 650 range. High game of 279...front 7, smash 7 pin, picked it up, back 4. Never got a 300. 

Favorite bowlers in PBA?"
casualiama,fh7hne7,t3_f1o7xo,1581332333.0,"Former competitive bowler here. Where most kids in middle and high school played ""real"" sports, I fell into an ADHD fueled life mission to become as good of a bowler as I could. So i respect the thankless hustle that is the world of bowling!!

My school district and state sanctioned bowling as an official sport in my high school years. We won state my sophomore year in a neck to neck bakers tournament. 

I say all of this simply because from bowler to bowler I know how lonely it can get and under appreciated it is. 

 Much love!!

What's your high series???"
