Don't hold yourself back do what will make you happy and fuck what other people think. It's your life to live by your standards and no one else's.

Well to start I have bipolar depression. I kinda screwed some things up in my relationship and I was failing in school and hated my job. I felt like life had nothing left for me.

I tried drinking an entire bottle of cough syrup and an entire bottle of tequila. Doctor said out of everything he was surprised the alcohol didn't take me.

I am happy. I ended up in behavioral therapy for a week and learned a lot about how to cope and deal with my emotions

Nothing beats good ol fashioned buttered noodles!"

I think I stopped her from being able to be her true self and I kind of did some ass hole things. Not an excuse for my actions but I was later diagnosed with Bipolar Depression. I think we weren't right for each other at the time yet we were a good lesson for each other. We have both grown from the experience and I think we both did truly love each other. I still think about her sometimes, she was my best friend all throughout elementary, middle, and highschool.

She hasn't talked to me since and it's honestly felt like mourning someone who died. Took me 3 years to finally be okay with the fact. I hope she is good and has found the happiness she deserves."
