casualnintendo,ez97lpb,t1_ez62d7t,1567775310.0,"[Terry Bogard](https://www.fightersgeneration.com/characters4/terry.html) is from [Fatal Fury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury:_King_of_Fighters) a highly influential fighting game series. Terry represents both Fatal Fury and [King of Fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Fighters), a crossover of all SNK fighting games that SNK is most known for.

SNK is not only known for their lasting influence on fighting games but also their [legendary sprite work](https://imgur.com/gallery/GPlx4), SNK has made a lasting impact on [sprite work](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0d2091d0d58b74d7723a6faa2e6d9bf/tumblr_inline_npldbmEzj01ri065t_500.gif) to this day.

Mexico was too poor of a country to afford Street Fighter arcade cabinets, so the country opted to get SNK fighting game arcade cabinets for their 2d fighter of choice. Today [the games still dominate Latin America's](https://kotaku.com/why-king-of-fighters-dominated-latin-americas-fighting-1837707799) fighting game scenes.

[King of Fighter 95](https://www.sourcegaming.info/2015/06/22/vol71/) also influenced Sakurai's design philosophy when it came to making Smash Bros.

Including SNK in the game is not really a matter of sales like Bayonetta or Corrin, but a matter of influence and impact. 

Terry joins the ""influence and impact"" crew, sitting next to the likes of Mr. Game and Watch, Ness, Captain Falcon, Shulk, and other lesser-known characters. Damn Avenger's Endgame would have been HELLA boring without the Guardians of the Galaxy to break the monotony."
