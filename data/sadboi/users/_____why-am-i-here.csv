selfharm,fr5rgln,t3_gmqbom,1589913418.0,It depends on the reason you cut. Like what you get out of it. But some things to try are drawing on your arms (this didn’t work for me but who knows) punching a wall. Squeezing ice is one I’ve heard as well. Or maybe listening to some crazy music live really heavy metal might help release the feeling.

u_acrsita,fr4888u,t1_fr32zei,1589879319.0,A sad soul. Hmm I’m never thought about that before. That actually makes perfect sense for me! I think my default is sad and I have to work everyday in order to be happy.

selfharm,fle1q3a,t3_fo9ypu,1585075943.0,I know how hard it is but never stop trying to get better. Get help. Think up different ways you can cope like using coping mechanisms. Draw on yourself with red marker. Squeeze ice or something. There’s an app called calm harm which might help you too. Maybe try writing all your feelings when you get urges (I know that sounds cringy but it could help). There’s people that care about you so talk to them. And if you need it there’s load of people here who would love to talk and help you.

selfharm,fhx0r40,t3_f567yc,1581939975.0,I just do it when I’m angry or depressed it releases the feeling. But then it makes me feel like shit.   Please please don’t start because it’s hard to stop when you do. Try other coping things.

selfharm,f8auq13,t3_dzwih6,1574412914.0,"Listen. You are alone and no one understands you  I am the exact same. The thing about reaching out is that people’s responses anger me because they just can’t possibly understand what I’m going through. 

Over time you just need to accept that you are different. Reach out to people for support but not understanding. 

Although you have probably heard this before everything will get better. You need to find the things you enjoy and zone in on them. It’s not easy but there are people who will support you even if they don’t understand and that ok.
