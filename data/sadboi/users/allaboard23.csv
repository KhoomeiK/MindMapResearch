Spiderman,X Men as a team,Wolverine,Thor,Iron Man,Cap hell I don't really know tbh. Villains is easier prolly Spidermans rogues,Magneto,Loki."

The more I've learned about Spiderman 3 and 4 the more I realize I don't think Venom or Sony were the issue.

From Dancing Peter,sandman as the killer and Peters need to cheat almost all of it goes back to Rami."
comicbooks,ep5vn6l,t1_ep5vesz,1559061434.0,"Yeah it works as a young plot point but by that point MJ ran off from her wedding for him. With the black suit you can make the argument it's the symbiote.

Without it he's just a dick who wanted to cheat"
comicbooks,ep5sl95,t1_ep5ko1c,1559060381.0,"Nah his idea was even worse he wanted Anne Hathaway as Vultures daughter and for her and Peter to be into each other. Essentially Venom saved Spiderman 3 imo.

Otherwise Peter woulda just been a cheating dick for no reason cause Rami loved drama"
