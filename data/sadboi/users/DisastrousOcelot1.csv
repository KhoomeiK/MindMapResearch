Have you tried going to. Naturopath or Chinese medicine doctor?
Firstly, anxiety is very much related to gut health and the presence of good bacteria , and if you took antibiotics your gut health could be severely messed up. You most likely have food Intolerances that are messing you up- the most common good intolerances are 
1. Wheat 2. Dairy 3. Corn 4. Soy 
Dietary imbalances can cause all kinds of issues and can cause your gut imbalance to be off as well as serious inflammation.
How is your diet? If your diet is poor this is the first place I would look to fix - diet isEVERYTHING.
You could have some kind of infection the doctors are missing like lymes, coron, parasites, but a good diet will help your body fight this and help the inflammation.
Inflammation is the root of all disease.
I strongly urge you to stop trying to find a ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù and focus on restoring your overall health of your body. There is a test called the complete stool analysis that will look at your digestion and that could help immensely.
PM me if you need to or have any questions."

Look into the book ""the autoimmune recovery plan""

It is written by a doctor who received a Hasimotos disease diagnosis and REVERSED IT. She has testimonials of reversing autoimmune disease in her practice. Essentially your immune system is supposed to function right and with some dietary and lifestyle changes you can cure your body. Especially for you, who seems like you are in the early stages of whatever and know your predisposed, you could certainly fix your immune system and live a healthy life.
