ptsd,fncznxa,t3_fyuhhr,1586852984.0,"I currently cannot watch drama or action tv shows due to PTSD flare ups; so like 90% of shows/movies I'm interested in watching I can't watch because I'll be triggered either during the show or afterwards.
It is excruciating. I hate it so deeply.
I can watch some kid's cartoons, Jeopardy, random topic anime (like How Heavy are the Dumbells that You Lift), and Star Trek (only TOS because it's older so visual effects aren't advanced for this day and age and the plot is relatively subdued, even then I can watch like... one episode every two or 6 weeks)."
ptsd,fncwmt7,t3_g0lhbw,1586849767.0,"I feel like I have to self trigger.

I have ptsd from a wildfire that took my home in 2017. I moved into the newly rebuilt house in March to quarantine (had been kind of couch surfing).

Everyday is self triggering because I feel like I have to live where the trauma took place; like I have to get over this somehiw because I don't have any other home to go to, but as things continue I wish my mom had bought a different house and didn't rebuild. But rebuilding was best for her (I'm 24, graduated college last year and haven't been able to move forward career wise due to PTSD).

If I didn't have to live here, I'd still self trigger just not as badly or constantly. The frequency in self triggering has gone down; I think I did it mostly because I can be faced with a trigger at any time (like nearly freaking anything that can get my anxiety up, no matter if it was directly trauma related or not) so by self triggering, I developed coping mechanisms or at least familiarity with being triggered so that I can handle it better. It's mostly to help me stay in control when I am truly triggered which helps my relationships with other people. It also helps me validate my PTSD. Like oh, yeah, still cannot handle that thing and react disproportionately bad. PTSD revalidated for the next X amount of days/weeks/months."
ptsd,fncv1i6,t3_fwqvkv,1586848168.0,"It's interesting.

I'm 24, and I got my PTSD from a wildfire in 2017. The house was finished being rebuilt mid-February of this year. I hadn't yet been able to move in (PTSD; had spent the night here like twice before quarantining), and the pandemic got me to move back. I have no doubt that I'd still be kind of couch surfing where I had been before had this not happened. I find myself barely able to hold it together and stay in the house as it is; I can't stop seeing fire everywhere. It's bad.

But.... It's nice to have the world on ""pause"" as I adjust to the new house and address my PTSD instead of feeling the constant need to keep going and going, without ever slowing down because to address my mental health doesn't allow me to be outwardly productive - so I get caught up in ignoring it and dissociating.

I wish I didn't have to work, but I work in health and am essential. My hours are already cut short, but I find myself glued to my bed. Ive been sitting in the corner a lot. Yesterday I made a fort underneath my bed.

Overall, the pandemic has helped because I'm unpacking a lot of the trauma and allowing myself to look at what my desired responses to things are, and I like having everybody else paused also, it doesn't feel like I'm a total failure that way...

It's really hard to be here and feel so intimately just how deep my trauma has cut into me. I've been dissociated almost all of the time this past month, with only a handful of hours that I can accurately account for. It's terrifying. As things continue, I get more and more worried that I'll still be a broken, unfunctional mess when society starts up again. Feeling this unknown deadline... Not knowing if I'll make it to some form of adult before then is frustrating."
