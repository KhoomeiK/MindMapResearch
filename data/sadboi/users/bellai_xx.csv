BPD,fpilz4o,t3_gdadnp,1588643680.0,"i 100% experience this ever since i can remember. what usually happens for me, is i pick up on the badass, bitchy, confident or outspoken character and it literally gives me a lot of confidence, like some sort of god complex depending on the character. like when i watch jennifer‚Äôs body i‚Äôll get traits from her, and she‚Äôs literally a man eating monster but she‚Äôs confident and badass. it‚Äôs really bad how much i do it, and i feel like my boyfriend realises when i do it. but it feels good in the moment, until i start to feel awkward because it‚Äôs so obvious lmaoo"
