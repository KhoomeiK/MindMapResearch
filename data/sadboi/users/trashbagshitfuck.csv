iamatotalpieceofshit,flt8xiz,t1_flt8g0q,1585463226.0,"I'm sorry but the Washington exanmier is absolutely not a reliable source. Also hormone blockers have been given to cis children with early onset puberty for years, didn't we just talk about this? And either way, trans kids do not start getting hormone replacement therapy until *maybe* when puberty starts. Children have a strong understanding of gender by the time they are 5 years old, and all transition before puberty is just clothes, names, pronouns, toys, etc. Im done talking to you since you obviously refuse to educate yourself on the reality of the situation. I hope you get better, honey."
iamatotalpieceofshit,flt8bjs,t1_flt88wi,1585462612.0,Remember they have been used on cisgender children for many many years please stop talking
iamatotalpieceofshit,flt7zfq,t1_flt7q6h,1585462273.0,Hormone blockers literally just give someone more time to decide if they want to transition or not. For most cases there aren't any issues with development just like in cis children with early puberty. Just because you don't know what it's like to be trans or have gender dysphoria or don't understand why someone would want to transition that doesn't mean you get to tell someone what to do when they are doing everything to safe way because you are horrendously uneducated and unempathetic.
