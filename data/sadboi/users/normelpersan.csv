Extremely thoughtful, well-written post.

Yes, I relate to so much. 

>I am dependent based on my need to react to others instead of just acting based on my own desires.

This is a direct quote taken out of my own brain. I literally feel codependent in others just to do simple things that are my own best interest. I'm just not motivated enough if it's only me

Seems like the way you describe yourself & the way others describe you are both valid. I think that just because you show different sides of yourself at different times doesn't make you any less you. It's all still you. ""Unstable self image"" is a very common trait in people with BPD so I relate to this to some extent. I have described myself as ""fiction"" before, and also I've described my friendships as ""simulations of what real friendships are"" üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ omg I'm just doing my best out here man"

Another thing I wish I learned about BPD is that our feelings are valid & we need to live with them. I feel you. BUT I do want to encourage you to EMBRACE your feelings & never REPRESS them. The bond you felt was REAL. The connection was real. It was just more intense than typical people and that is OK. We experience elation, love, & loss more intensely than others and that is OK. There's nothing we can do to make ourselves not feel intensely. We must feel our feelings, accept them, embrace them, and ENJOY them while they're pleasant ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è They are valid. Feelings are valid. But they're for us only. Until we consciously choose to reveal things to others

With that said, although our FEELINGS are always valid,  behavior is something that we need to learn to control. DBT is helping me immensely with this! I've learned that I am going to be dysregulated sometimes (depression, obsession, self harm) but giving myself permission to feel and learning some coping tools, I am less reactive & I'm able to mitigate the intensity & length of the dysregulation episodes

I'm happy you're coming out of your month long agony. And I'm so sorry for your loss. I understand you very deeply. My last s/o lasted 3 months and it took me about 6 months or so to start to feel like myself again. There'd be these instances, I called them ""cracks"" where some time (minutes at 1st) would go by where I wasn't hurting and then CRACK! I remembered he was gone & the agony would knock me on my ass.
