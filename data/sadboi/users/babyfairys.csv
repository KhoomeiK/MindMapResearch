BPD,fge3iow,t3_exolvw,1580690522.0,oh my god yes. i’ve been talking to my therapist about it bc i feel so gross and have triggers that make me think of these two men i knew when i was younger and i just know something happened but i can’t remember anything. it makes me so sad to see so many people relate
BPD,ffmxtea,t1_ffl9h2j,1580060019.0,yes!
BPD,far9ibl,t3_eaea34,1576313480.0,"i do the same thing. i’m in a long distance relationship and i’ll know things like she’s busy or doing something where she can’t reply but i can’t help but feel like i did something wrong and even when i recognize i didn’t do anything, my brain doesn’t let it process or believe it and it’s honestly exhausting.  she knows how to reassure me and all but it always comes back. some days are better than others but sometimes it’s really horrible and it scares me to the point where i’m afraid i’m gonna ruin everything that we have."
