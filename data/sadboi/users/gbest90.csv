TBI,fqf50ro,t3_giki5w,1589318833.0,"9 years TBI, 29 (M) Felt cognitive decline around 25 as well, at 29 now it’s getting worse. I’ve tried multiple prescription drugs but they only mask the problem & make most of my symptoms worse. Physiotherapy, neuroscientists, cranial sacral, massage, chiropractor, hyperbaric, & many other treatments only provide temporary relief in the moment. The next day, all my symptoms are back & usually worse. I continue to try new things & have healthy routines, but at the end of the day & start of every morning, I’m in pain again. 

I have existing mental illnesses & disorders, those seem to be preventing my brain from healing according to the 1 helpful doctor out of around 30 doctors I’ve seen. 

Also, I was delivered from a forcep delivery, so that easily could have been my first brain injury, and now the trauma is stacked from multiple concussions.

Have faith in yourself & you can find peace somewhere. It’s my cats for me"
