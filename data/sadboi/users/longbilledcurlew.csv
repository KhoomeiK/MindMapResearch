AsianMasculinity,fe7me1j,t1_fe5mien,1578916443.0,"5' 3"" is VERY short for a man. I'm a white woman who is 5' 7"" so not in your preferred dating pool anyway but I would honestly never date someone that short. My friends feel the same way. I'm not trying to be rude but you seem like a reality- focused guy who can handle the truth. Do Asian women feel this way too? Most of them are shorter than I am so I'm just curious. I live in Boston too so I suppose that skews things as well."

I did watch the first Missing 411 and was thinking the entire time that the parents had some involvement in that case, definitely. I guess that would fit with how he focuses on certain details to make cases sound like they fit his pattern even if there is an answer staring him right in the face. No offense to him. I guess. :)"

I love deeply troubled people like you with serious anger issues. You're all nice on the surface and then one tiny poke and you show your true colors. An angry toddler. I hope you are lying about having children as well, because if you actually do, I would honestly fear for their wellbeing."

amIuglyBrutallyHonest,f4buh1i,t1_f4bsurk,1571518710.0,"That's a really interesting point! One other thing I forgot to say is that I think prison MAKES some people into criminals. They go in for a drug offense, get out and their record follows them around like a tin can on their tail. They can't get a job, start using again, and reoffend. Truly a new type of criminal. I'm keeping my eye on Portugal as well. Thanks for the conversation! I love this stuff."

They are not necessarily irrevocably criminal types but if they get out of jail and continue using drugs they will probably reoffend. 15% people who did something really bad and regret it and probably won't offend again. Probably about 25% what society considers 'bad' (people who truly have antisocial personality disorder, no empathy, career criminals or people who have killed and will kill again when/if they get out)."

You are very good-looking (like better than 75% of people) yet you feel ""repulsive"". I can relate to at least some of this. I also had really bad cystic acne when I was younger. I literally didn't want to leave my house. It took a while of having clear skin before I felt even ok about myself. Still to this day (I'm 39) if I get a pimple I freak out. People don't always understand how psychologically damaging bad acne can be.

That's my long-winded way of saying that I think you look very handsome and I'm very happy for you and your wife. Knowing each other since you were twelve! That is so awesome. You deserve a good life free of worry about your looks."
