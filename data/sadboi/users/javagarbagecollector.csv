Endo,fqd23g4,t1_fqcx8a2,1589277026.0,"I understand. I also think it should not be like this. I love eating too!! But I actually found replacements for everything that I love. There are spelt products that taste the exact same as wheat actually. Spelt pasta, spelt bread. One of my favorites is buckwheat. I have managed to change my diet and still eat super tasty. I m also gluten and sugar free now, a few years on. that was harder. But cutting wheat alone made a huge, huge difference. The most difference of all things I ever tried and the future looked grim before that. I got the idea when I read a study that said a lot of women are symptom free after cutting wheat for a couple months, so it's not just me.

I am so extremely sorry for how you are feeling. It sounds like pure hell. You will get better, whatever it takes. This fucked up disease will not win. Sending you big big virtual hugs."

Don't think he's capable of putting himself in my shoes whatsoever. I miss some isolated things about him like his intellect. and I still miss him romantically but the latter feels more like Traumatic attachment.

raisedbynarcissists,fg1i412,t1_ff49gy0,1580427515.0,"Just saw that I never replied to you - sorry!! Your story about hugs is so interesting. Its interesting to look at feelings as triggers that you can often trace back to your childhood. I have many of those triggers installed in myself as well. For example, I hate when my roommate knocks on my door and wants something from me because I instantly think about my mom yelling for me when I was just in chilling in my room in peace. But this is also why sometimes I distrust myself and think I am unfairly projecting onto others and that my reaction is over the top for the situation on hand.

I agree with everything you said about him. I wrote a little update in case you are interested (its kind of boring but just in case!). I am trying to be careful as fuck. If I see another sign of chronic infidelity or lying I will walk. I made this a hard boundary now. 

""I'm also not sure what he means by ""...to give him peace of him"" but it sounds... ominous. Creepy."" - lol so true, I myself am not sure what he meant by that. Like does he naturally feel superior to everyone he has personally met? hierarchical thinking in social situations is a huge big red flag actually.... although I think many men do this when comparing themselves to other men.... uggghhh fuck.... 

I actually feel very independent and like I don't need a relationship. Like I am not even such a good relationship player as all my relationships were very detached and as if I was still single kind of. Could never count on my exes, could never depend on them. Felt casual. But I do have hopes attached to this relationship now because I haven't had a crush like this in so long. It felt for a minute as if I finally had a shot at a great, normal relationship. It just felt so good. Wishful thinking definitely in place."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fg1gc78,t1_ff4023f,1580426597.0,"wrote a little update, kinda boring but just in case you're interested :)"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fg1g9mx,t1_ffatv0d,1580426559.0,""" You just gotta go with his behavior towards you and not what he says but what he actually does."" - preach sister, I will save this quote away just to remind myself again because its so absolutely true.

""(....) why would it be okay if he’s not one?"" - I guess because sometimes normal people do things that could be interpreted as narc behaviour but it comes actually from a different place. When normal people lie for example, there is usually a reasoning attached that is accessible as in you can talk to them about it, understand where they are coming from and change their outlook. Whereas you can never understand a narc, change their outlook and there is next to nothing attached to their lying. For them its just how every get through life. Does it make sense? I am definitely overly sensitive to things that could be interpreted as narc stuff based on my history and man, my mind can really go places when anxiety kicks in. 

which brings me to my last point. I have extensive experience with narcissism. Thats why I am looking for it in others first. Which is why its by biggest fear in life and also why I am posting here :)

LifeAfterNarcissism,ff423sd,t1_ff4023f,1579553873.0,"I will for sure keep you people posted! you have really gone out of your way to help me. I have a therapist appointment on wednesday so I will wait until then to set up my final strategy. I haven't spoken to him since our fight as it ended on me telling him he's too pushy so I guess he backed off. 

> I feel like you've gotten a lot of good advice on this sub, I guess I'm just curious, do you feel clear about where you're at? If you put all of what you've read here from everyone here to the side and decided to just check in with yourself, what do you feel like you want to do if you just ask yourself without overthinking?

right now the thought of being in contact with him sends me back into panic... as I said, I will not get back into contact before seeing my therapist. everyone who replied here helped a ton! I don't feel confused anymore and I stopped questioning my panic. Now i just feel it fully. And i feel my full extent of anxiety regarding the relationship. There are some things I don't know if I can get over. The lying about cheating. The being too friendly still with his ex (triangulation?). The pushiness. Very sceptical right now that we can recover and as sad as it is I think I will feel better walking away if I see no easy way of fixing. I feel good about opening that possibility up to myself. Feels better than the total cognitive dissonance. 

I saved your point about asking open ended questions as to not present with loopholes!!!!!!!! SO IMPORTANT. I wish I had sb to coach me how to do that properly as I also see that as my ONLY chance to get real information even if just between the lines. Sucks to what extreme lengths we have to go to stay safe!?

Lastly, my adopted sister has borderline. she is a severe case.... I learned fairly quickly that sustainability isn't a hallmark of our relationship. She will cut me off for months, then come back as if nothing happened. I learned never to rely on her. I think my guy now has a different energy. For all I can tell his life appears stable and filled with routine. He also never has beef at work with colleagues etc. Not like the other narcs that I knew who constantly were followed by drama and who got into power struggles with everyone. As far as I can tell his colleagues really love him. He also doesn't have this kind of intense BPD energy. 

But eerily, there is something. I can feel there is something. When I met him I immediately thought he must have had narc parents at least just by how charming and people pleasing he can be. But I have narc parents too so I didn't want to judge him too hard. I never met his parents so I can't tell. He always says his childhood has been awesome so no hints there either..."
raisedbynarcissists,ff3y3yd,t1_ff2pe6l,1579551383.0,"Thank you too for your reply and deep thoughts!!!! 

I am thankfully not so worried he could work my friends against me. I only have a very small group of friends anyways lol and they are very loyal and also clear-visioned. I do also want them to meet him just so I can have a second opinion on him. But him meeting my friends is triggering to me because it would solidify his role in my life and what if I don't trust him like that yet. Thats why I wanted to move slowly. Too slowly for him.

I am mortified by the thought of him meeting my parents though. My parents are highly skilled manipulators and will use everything I present them with that belongs to my person (my job, my friends, my hobbies) against me. They will be overjoyed to find another pawn on the chess board they can use to gain power. And if he would turn out narc, in the narc meets narc scenario I am usually  the one loosing. My ex bf who was a super narc teamed up with my mom against me so fast, it was nuts. My ex also offered to kindly mediate conflicts between me and my family lol. what a fucking psycho. 

The situation with my family will never get better and I am planning on moving away further from them so I have an excuse to never go see them. 

I will go over all of this thread with my therapist on wednesday and I will write you guys an update!!"
raisedbynarcissists,ff3xbnk,t1_feyy3a6,1579550893.0,"I also share the feeling of paranoia. The distrust I have in myself and what I feel really is the absolute worst about all of this.

Oh my God the compliment shit hits home!!!!!!!!!! what the heck that is so smart. The exaggeration really does replace truly seeing a person. I don't know actually if I feel truly seen. I will give this some serious thought now!

I can see now with the help of the commentators here that he has indeed been extremely pushy and I somehow failed to see this as selfishness. 

You also bring up such great points regarding my best friend. I already had such a bad conscious when I hung out with him last time and low key felt bad the entire time. for what? for absolutely nothing. He's having this effect already. I remember also now that the greatest narc I have ever been with also drove me away from my best male friend back in the day. wow I really need to be so careful right now to NEVER do that again to my friends. 

He said he just wants to meet my best friend to give him peace of him because we are so close and we have visited each others families frequently and stuff like that. well my best friend has been with me through every single thing and wheeled me around in a wheel chair when I got surgery. so yeah, we are basically family at this point and I get why maybe that would make my guy insecure? at the same time I feel like he just walked into my life a minute ago and is already trying to change things around or insert himself into spots he did not earn.... 

Realistically... how long do I need to keep going to be able to fall for a man who is actually normal? I am tired."
LifeAfterNarcissism,ff3wdi5,t1_fewgvjx,1579550297.0,"I feel like I have been scapegoated more but also have had bouts of golden-childism. Generally I am over-diagnosing narcissism in others though. to me, everyone is a narc until proven differently. It gives me intense panic and it inhibits me from pursuing friendships or be more extroverted generally. so this bias is why I think I could be full of shit in this case. But honestly you guys have kind of opened my eyes and I feel now I might be onto something...

It sucks so bad because I really haven't felt this in love since so many years. Actually since I had met my last grandiose narc relationship. This in itself might be red flag (yeah i fully distrust my own feelings too). But I really thought I was getting lucky for once. guess back to zero...."
LifeAfterNarcissism,ff3vvv5,t1_ff0pswm,1579549994.0,"ok that took me a while to understand hahahahahahahhaah you are smart! also so super smart to relate this to psychological concepts. Its so interesting. I sure am no expert on the codependent dynamic yet. I pretty much have no idea how to look for it. I feel like I would take it any day over narcissism but maybe that is naive. 

This comment is the one comment that induced me with a tiny bit of hope that he is coming from a different place. maybe one that we could explore together and make it work. Then I logged onto instagram and saw that he liked every single bikini picture of his ex and is tagged with a girl in his arm from a party where I could not attend (we are still having this fight described in my post currently and not spoken since really because it gives me a panic attack) and my fleeting sensation of sympathy vanished like ice cream in the summer lol"
LifeAfterNarcissism,ff3vh6k,t1_fezeoc8,1579549738.0,"thank you for your reply again. Yeah I can see clearly now that he really likes to steamroll me into things. Thinking back he really has been doing it right from the first date. He explained it to me by saying he gets excited about his vision and he wants to make stuff happen and doesn't understand how I can't see it sometimes. He can be very very pushy with certain things which i had previously been finding kind of funny/different/refreshing because he would just sometimes show up to me house and stuff like that (not too creepy stuff). but now I see thats totally selfish and egotistical and truly doesn't take into account what I want at that moment. I didn't think about that.

He didn't seem to treat his exes bad. They still have a lot of pictures of them together on social media. His ex is actually lurking on mine and its fucking me up. He still likes every single picture she posts too and apparently they are ""friends"".... They seemed to have had a good relationship for 3 years from what it looks honestly. too good! It actually gives me anxiety too how friendly they are with each other now because I remember that narc love to triangulate. I am very close to reaching out to her and asking her about him. Get a little perspective. The only reason why I m not doing it is because I don't trust her either and honestly from what I have seen SHE LOOKS LIKE A NARC. jesus christ you should see her online presence. its insane. she is the absolute definition of superficial charm, attention hungry etc. But its not the usual ""my ex was crazy and then I met you"" story. Self proclaimed, his exes all still like him (too much?).

he also said the other day that he is scared by how fast he is falling for me and that he had planned not to do that. .... idk some stuff he says makes me think hes truthful and capable of wholesome feelings. other stuff doesn't. After you guys encouraged me I told him to stop being pushy and he said hes sorry and that I should just tell him to back off if he is and that its only coming from a place of wanting more of me etc.

an no way in hell his behaviour would be ok if he was a narc. If I had proof today, I would run and never look back. Block and run."
LifeAfterNarcissism,ff3ujgp,t1_fewibf5,1579549155.0,I will talk to him and my therapist about it...
LifeAfterNarcissism,fezw9hc,t1_fezq0ht,1579462476.0,"Thanks for bringing this up. Such a sharp observation honestly. In my experience also narcs can't be close friends for long. He said that he kept his ex best friend around because he actually felt sorry for him but also admired him.

Furthermore it seems as if he is adopting traits of his girlfriends for the time he is with them and now he is trying out the same with me. He has told me already that I have such a strong influence on him. I don't know what that is exactly but I m scared of it for sure because in my experience that's mirroring and belongs in the category ""narc stuff"". A little bit of this is also normal though? If he's the codependent one right now does that mean I am the narc in this scenario?????!!! I feel like I have been codependent myself with my ex narcs before though.  Who knows though. Oh man I want no part of this,I just want to have a normal relationship :( relationships seem so dangerous."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fextw3t,t1_few7uk5,1579436155.0,"Thank you massively for writing up a whole screenplay. Everyone on the narc subs is so awesome and so helpful, so careful and considerate, I have been so much better since receiving replies on this!!

I agree with every point you have. Especially the very last part where you say you are too vulnerable to date. Thats probably me as well and I should have recognised this much earlier lol 

I might add to 5. that from his point of view I think he was ready to quit me earlier but I kept telling him I need time and I also didn't tell him about the reluctant part. He is not happy about the fact I am not super enthusiastic about everything. He doesn't really get why I am so fearful about surrendering my all to him. 

You know what I am thinking of now is that I need to have a conversation with him and basically tell him my suspicions and everything that I observe but what is the absolute worst is that narcs will never obviously admit to being a narc and any conversation about it will not result in any good outcome. He won't be like ""yeah you caught me, have a nice day"". Is there any way I can have a conversation about this where I can ""trap"" him? Is there I way I could set up questions so that his answer would confirm or deny my suspicions?

Another thing I am thinking about is, why are his exes still friendly with him? He was with his last ex for 3 years and they had a nice relationship on social media. Tons of photos, he seemed so proud of her, not the type to steal sb's light at all!!!!! No sob stories. He has no sob stories to tell about himself at all. I thought these are things that don't fit the description of a narc. But then again, he left her after 3 years cold and moved to a different country without considering her wishes at all. He has left all of his exes so far and said that at first he worshipped them and then suddenly after he felt like he pulled equal with them he lost his love for them. I know, MASSIVE red flag. But he somehow told me he thinks differently now and he reflected on why that happened and why that can't happen with me again and that also he was young and now he wants to build a life. basically he wasn't ready mentally for marriage back then but now he is. He originally set out to be single for 2 year after his last ex but then met me and said I was the only one he felt such a connection with that it made him reconsider his decision. But he said its very special and he would not have broken this promise to himself with anyone. 

Another thing that I haven noticed is that he definitely has a thing for narcs as best friends. His best friend for 8 years was a super narc who in the end dropped him and stopped being his friend. He is very heartbroken about what this friend did to him. Yet he has sought out the exact same kind of male narc company again now for his inner most circles. I truly think his male best friends are extremely openly narcy, rude and have shitty value systems in place and I don't trust them.

Its so bad that the final decision if sb is a narc is entirely up to you. you can't figure it out together as a couple. I feel so alone and so so sad and I fear I m just part of a power play instead of a relationship again. Super sorry for a bit of a chaotic response. I am just typing my thoughts up as they come. I hope you can still make something out of them... big virtual hugs!!"

Honestly, the thought experiment of somebody I trust coming into my life and confirming my anxieties are justified would somehow bring a lot of clarity, just as you said. Ever since I have gotten the first replies to this post it my mental chaos got more and more replaced with a path of reassurance. 

I am so sad though. It is so scary that they do not show their true selves until you have surrendered to them fully. This makes me scared of opening up romantically to anyone. I fear so strongly that the moment I do it, everyone will show their second face.

raisedbynarcissists,few3p6c,t1_fevxijn,1579404904.0,"ok your answer is golden. Just like so many people on here I can read from your reply how tuned in you are, how much you can read between the lines and how hyperviligant you are about details - just as me!!!! because that is what narc abuse does to you. it gives you almost a superpower to read into sb else's mind. Thank you for using your superpower for the good and investing it into me right now!!

I have copied your reply and will go through it with my therapist, you are raising some serious points. The trust is earned and not demanded thing. Spot on. I also had a suspicion that he tries to take some short cuts that are strange like maybe he lacks the ability to make people open up, to make them feel good yet he still demands what is inside of them. I did have a thought like that. 

He says he has never been as crazy about a girl before except one time and she dumped him or something... idk.... i hate hearing exaggerated compliments like that ""you are the most this and that"".... thats such a red flag for me. Unfortunately he does give these exaggerated compliments. 

Another thing I remembered just now is that I actually feel like I have already given him so much and always the best of me. It is so weird to me he still thinks I m holding back. Like I am never holding back when we are together its like... what else does he want from me? 

The only thing I would like to add to your analysis is that he is not trying to isolate me from my friends, hes actually trying to meet them because I guess he wants to have a less confined relationship and I do see that as my fault, its true, I have anxiety about letting him into my life. but he also wants to meet my male best friend because I am very close to him and hes jealous and freaked out that he has never met him lol which is understandable i believe."

I can say that more than once I had a strange feeling like he wasn't telling the whole truth and that it was really hard to infer what he was thinking. Another symptom might be that he also thinks I am lying about some stuff or I am having affairs on the side. Like why does he even think that if not because its something that is on HIS mind.... fuck I feel nauseous
raisedbynarcissists,fevy1k4,t1_fevrwbd,1579402977.0,"you are an angel right now!!!!!!! Your input is super valuable and very intelligent, I can tell. 

Thats right, I was kind of pushed into it by the two of them. If it would have been for me, I would have kept things in an awkward vague undefined zone. I have strong feelings for him (which might also be a red flag given my history as sad as that is) and I think he has some seriously beautiful traits. When I go through narc checklists he doesn't seem to score highly. But the lying and a few other little things have struck me as red flags. Then again, I DO NOT trust myself AT ALL. I have zero sense of direction, I do not trust myself to make a sensibel assessment of any man anymore and I do not trust myself to make a sensible decision for or against a relationship. Best I could do was not decide. 

""...or would she understand how they could be symptomatic of a current dynamic?"" - wow holy shit I don't actually know if she would be able to understand that. I guess I should ask her. I would hope she could see the truth regardless on her general expertise of narcissism because she is very smart and extremely tuned in. But I should definitely bring up if she is familiar with the cycles. 

I am 100% experiencing a part of this kind of traumatic cycle. It all feels way familiar. It feels like my past relationships exactly. I have felt like this before, for sure. My only question now is, did I internalise this cycle and I now go through it regardless of how good my relationship is or are my senses onto something? I guess you already answered this question in your last paragraph...."

raisedbynarcissists,feviwai,t1_fevetan,1579397943.0,"thank you so much for investing time and thought into my story!!!! helps so so so so much right now! We started hooking up and everything was cheesy and peachy but from the get go I told him I needed to take things very slowly. We did not know each other at all before we started dating (dating app) so I wanted to make sure we are friends first and foremost and that we respect each other as people so we can have a sustainable romantic relationship on top maybe some day. Thats why I was reluctant, because I did not want to rush into things. I wanted to see his real face first, see what kind of person he is. He agreed to everything and said he would just be patient but his patience maxed out at about 3 1/2 months. He then asked me to be his girlfriend. His behaviour towards me has not changed from day one I must say, he has been quite steady in character display but to me, a couple of months is still next to nothing, especially because I work so fucking much that we didn't spend a whole lot of time or went thought a variety of things. I tried to keep things at a distance, tried to suss out any dangers from a meta-level. My therapist then basically said this isn't how it works and I should just try it out, that I could always break up if I feel the need. I entered the relationship and I felt ok about it the first few weeks. Then the feels I described in my post started settling in"
LifeAfterNarcissism,feve70i,t1_fevc6am,1579396411.0,"thank you so much for your comment. I appreciate all of you so much. You are right, better walk away now than later. He struck me as a pretty reliable dude otherwise. I felt like he was doing what he said he would and vice versa. I felt like he has good empathy and when I cried in front of him his reaction was so incredibly nice and warm. also his past relationships all ended on an ok note and his exes still talk to him and are friendly so no sob story, no horrible break-ups. I thought these were all good signs. What do"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fevbp75,t1_fevafvo,1579395478.0,"this is my thought too .... but... isn't this something many people would lie about especially in the beginning and then later he contradicted himself, said sorry and told me all about it.... isn't that a redeeming quality?? I want to be wrong so badly"
raisedbynarcissists,feuxkmt,t1_feux3th,1579390974.0,"sorry me reply was on the other post. I wrote:

oh no you guys.... this makes my heart sink even further.... oh no.... oh no..... ......... He said he lied before because he wanted to make himself look good because he wanted to impress me because he wanted to be in a relationship with me and I was not too enthusiastic at first. He apologised and said in this moment he really wanted to believe it about himself and he knows it was dumb. He answered all my questions about the times he did it. I cried a little while after because it gave me an anxiety attack and he comforted me very very warmly and lovingly although he had work in the morning."
raisedbynarcissists,feux3th,t1_feuuug0,1579390828.0,I know. This is how my last relationship went exactly. I had anxiety the whole way through basically. in the end all of my suspicions proved true and I played a 3 year long joke on myself lol I mean seriously I saw it coming a mile away and still rode it out what the fuck!!! Its different this time though. or at least i really want to think that. I feel like he's an integrated person from what I can see...? I answered above his reaction to my reaction to him lying. He constantly tells me he's crazy about me and has changed from his past and thought about why it happened and he doesn't plan on cheating on me (obviously) and that he really wants to build a life with me. I m sitting here Saturday night alone wanting nothing more than to binge on benzos to stop the panic

Supplements,fc46gab,t3_efw1ci,1577407893.0,I think NAC would be worth looking into
PCOS,fc0y60i,t3_efgxw4,1577302866.0,"I really really doubt it's exercise. Common how much we talking here. Cramps aren't even necessarily a PCOS symptom. I would suspect for example that you still eat something that your body isn't fond of maybe even because you have switched all foods around. Cutting out wheat for me has cut cramps in half. All kinds, even whole grain. Could also just generally be your body adjusting to dietary changes. It reacts quite strongly and needs a bit of time."

AskWomenOver30,fajspnk,t1_faipe6d,1576153655.0,damn lady you got the wisdom!!! I unfortunately read these studies saying attractive men (more attractive than their partners) are more likely to cheat (probably because they have the opportunity?) meanwhile actually unattractive woman (more unattractive than their partners) are also more likely to cheat. lol. so its like the most unstable combination. Personally I also made the experience that my least attractive partners had a huge ego problem and tried to validate themselves through flirting with others. that was incredibly annoying and made for a lose lose situation on my end. so the research doesnt match my personal experience but undeniably I am scared my gorgeous boyfriend will one day hit the hills with a younger girl.

AskWomenOver30,f53eyq2,t3_dml5sd,1571959255.0,"This is 100% unconventional advice and you will probably think I m crazy but desperate times require out-of-the-box solutions. Try magic mushrooms. They really helped me (I have been through a lot, dm me for hot details lol). They made me see things from a different perspective and made me feel and know as opposed to just intellectually understand that because I had given it my all and had loved so much in the relationship with my ex, I was in fact the ""winner"" of my horrible breakup. Why would you go through life trying anything less than. what is there to gain from hiding, not feeling love, being scared, inauthentic. You should feel sorry for your ex. Mushrooms brought this home to me. They also can act as anti depressants, similar to SSRIs, and have effect on other rigid brain states such as OCD, addiction, etc. Hit me up if you need sources."

ActualWomen,ew0uvuk,t1_ew0aqq3,1565006946.0,yea this is the thing! I feel like with migraines what helps some people is a trigger for others which makes it scary for a person to try something!!

AskWomenOver30,ew02o61,t1_ew028dh,1564974027.0,"snap. i was assuming the same thing as you, namely that there is no correlation between the thyroid issue and the migraine issue. I thought they were two pretty separate disorders and treatment would target distinctly different hormones. To solve this issue you only changed your type of meds and not the dosis, right?"

migraine,evzvuyy,t1_evzulm7,1564968667.0,I want to pin this comment somewhere for everyone to read. You are literally prevented from accurate testing. I guess we will have to wait for a time where we can have something like a hormone monitoring device like a glucose monitoring device for at home testing. ....... until then science has left us.
