depression,fbxrawo,t1_fbxi094,1577198335.0,"This is where I'm at. 

It's a sad type of coping. But it's working, if nobody cares enough to notice me, may as well do whatever the fuck I want, right?"
depression,f1iiimo,t1_f1gvyaz,1569510910.0,I feel uncomfortable about how much I relate to this.
depression,ezx1w48,t1_ezwgbv4,1568230195.0,"This is kind of the epiphany I had just this morning. 

I use memes and sarcasm to mask the fact that any actual personality I had was snuffed out a long fucking time ago."
depression,esdwyw6,t1_esdndj5,1561871672.0,"Honestly until you mentioned retail I was gonna say you sound like my coworker. 

He's a man that seems to be full of regret and anger at his life choices. He always throws himself into his work and projects outside of the home. It makes me think he's either super well adjusted or about to snap at any given moment without a distraction. 

I'm the opposite. I just try to sleep it away as much as possible."
depression,esdq8wd,t1_esdppzi,1561865206.0,"It had nothing to do with you likely, they're probably just shitty punk kids who have nothing better to do than terrorize random people for a hollow chuckle from their equally shitty friends."
depression,esdq4mg,t1_esdmz3g,1561865100.0,"Same, but Jesus I'd never say it to anyone else."
depression,esdm98e,t3_c76cpe,1561861699.0,"You're far from alone with this feeling. 

I have a husband I adore, parents would do anything for me, and a small but strong group of friends I can depend on. 

But nearly everyday, especially lately, I feel like I'm drowning in loneliness and screaming in a room full of people who can't hear me. I dream about driving myself off of a cliff or strapping some heavy weights to my ankles and sinking to the bottom of my pool. Just to make these feelings go away. 

It doesn't make sense. And it doesn't have to. The feelings are valid and I'm so fucking sorry you have that internal struggle to deal with. Nobody deserves to feel this way."
depression,esdlxju,t3_c74z44,1561861412.0,"Hey, cleaning your room is a big thing! 

Hell, even if you only got half of it cleaned up. That's more than cleaning none of it and you have to let yourself have those small victories. 

I'm proud of you."
depression,esdlugx,t1_esdk48x,1561861336.0,"This. 

As someone who's been varying levels of suicidal for as long as I can remember. It's not about what the people around me do or don't do. It's a soul crushing pain, hopelessness, and desperation that seeps out of the deepest parts of my mind and infects every inch of my being. And the overwhelming desire to make that feeling go away however you can. 

I know that probably doesn't help. But I felt this point needed to be reinforced. This definitely isn't your fault."
depression,esddxaa,t3_c6zzg0,1561854571.0,"Yeah I get you entirely. 

Hell, sometimes even when I'm feeling my worst and try to kind of show it without being overtly ""Hey I'm super fucking depressed!"" People turn a blind eye. 

Nobody wants to be around depression ðŸ™ƒ"
depression,es8lw33,t1_es8kz7e,1561702995.0,"Thank you.

 I really appreciate you taking a bit of your time to say that to me. 

That reads as sarcastic but I'm being 100% genuine."
depression,es7zp4u,t1_es6yuue,1561684343.0,"This, even if nobody responds. Knowing it's out there helps for at least a few minutes. Sometimes that's all I can ask for."
depression,es2udbc,t3_c5lp9g,1561541095.0,"I can't help, but I can confirm that you're not alone in feeling this way. 

Hopefully we can all find that happiness one of these days..."
depression,es2tygy,t3_c5n7pr,1561540429.0,"You're not alone there, this sounds like exactly what I go through. 

Sadly I don't have much advice except to try to set yourself up for the bad times when you're kind of feeling okay. Like get some dry shampoo for those days when a full hair wash feels impossible. Grab stuff that's easy to eat for when cooking seems like too much. Save an album of photos you love and look back to them. Little things like that add up on a really bad day. 

I hope you hit a good patch soon, and that it sticks."
depression,es2tml6,t1_es2tii5,1561539897.0,"I think that's part of the problem actually, I'm alone so much these days. 

I feel so fucking lonely. Yet being with people also makes me feel worse, it's a fucked up catch 22. 

The idea of taking a solo trip for even  just a few hours may do something. I've found that after work I stay in my car for ages just listening to music. There's nobody in the house when I get home but for some reason I have a odd sense of peace that just evaporates when I get out of my car."
depression,es23a4y,t3_c5hm11,1561512754.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this as well. But I'd be a liar if I said it wasn't somewhat reassuring to hear someone else say it. 

By most objective standards, my life is pretty good. 

I have a stable relationship with someone I love, a pretty decent family life, I'm not wealthy but money isn't a worry for us, I have dogs I love to pieces, and a decent social network. 

I think about these things and I'm so thankful and grateful. But I still can't seem to get away from these darks thoughts and feelings grabbing me by the ankles, my hair, whatever they can get a hold of, just to drag me down to a place where it feels easier to just stop trying to get better. 

That I'm a stupid piece of shit that doesn't deserve to be happy and I'm delusional for ever thinking otherwise. But that I can't kill myself because then I'd be a selfish piece of shit who couldn't keep her easy life together enough to not kill herself. Like how much of a fuck up do I have to be to screw up that badly when I got life on easy mode? 

I shouldn't want to die. But I do. And that's fucking infuriating."
depression,es22mea,t3_c5di4y,1561512252.0,"Only all the time. 

Like when I get really down, I know venting would do a load of good but don't want to talk to anyone I actually know. Yet talking to a stranger doesn't seem to have the same benefits for me."
depression,es1yabb,t3_c5a33r,1561508994.0,"Empty is my good days anymore. I'd rather feel nothing at all then an overwhelming sense of despair and worthlessness. 

Is that fucked up? 

But yeah. I think it's a coping mechanism. For me at least."
depression,es1y2pr,t1_es1pouo,1561508830.0,"This is the perfect way to describe shit. 

When my mental state is at its worst. Literally the only things keeping me from just getting my gun out of the safe and sticking it in my mouth is knowing that my mom would probably do the same shortly after. 

My older brother was killed in a car crash when I was a kid and she's admitted having other kids was the only thing that kept her from ""ending it all and going to be with him"" she's said she doesn't know what would happen if something happened to my sister or I. 

Even if she'd power on for my sister and the grandkids. I don't think I could put her through that again and sometimes I hate it. 

Also I can't explain to my dogs why mommy is never coming back. 

If I just never existed to begin with, these would be nonissues and everyone would be far better off for it."
