>By Julia Elena Alvear P.
>
>The videos of an assault on the outside of a bank in Costa Rica, left many perplexed, by everything that happened.
>
>When one sees the first images of what happens and the story that is discovered later, one finds words that define that evil does not triumph, because there are always those who have the character to face evil.
>
>So it was. A motorcycle is seen arriving with two people and a third who was on foot, a man with a helmet snatches the bag from a woman who approached the BAC bank (Costa Rica), and easily snatched it. The woman is not beaten, she throws herself on the floor and they bring her the money she was going to deposit.
>
>What the criminals did not count on is that the first mistake they made to carry out the assault plan was to go through the bank's showcase, because inside it, a man with enough courage and training would see them.
>
>Seeing the assault, the man came out and confronts the assailant, who he knocks down on the floor, trying to avoid taking the bag to the lady who is lying face down, without moving, not even looking, or running away.
>
>When security intervenes, one of the sons arrives (in a green and gray striped sweater) and then the youngest of the sons pulls out a gun and shoots a short distance at the bank security. And here the security also uses his weapon and injures the son and another man with a helmet appears who turns out to be the father, takes the weapon from the floor. They grapple with security. The weapons come out, the bad guys shoot and security too. A bullet passes near the thrown woman, but the security that is also hit does not hesitate to continue shooting and ends with the three criminals. If you see in the video there is a citizen who is the one who was transporting the woman in a red car, who upon seeing the assault goes down and helps to thwart the assault as well. This is a man in a light blue plaid shirt,
>
>THE SURPRISE OF THE MALEANTE FAMILY
>
>When the Costa Rican Police investigators began to verify the identity of the assailants, they find their documents and discover that they were all family, a father and two children. But the worst was, that when verifying the identity of the allegedly assaulted woman, it is discovered that she was the wife of the elder assailant and mother of the other two.
>
>The lady worked as an accountant in a store and deposited the money with the Bank. Greed seduced her, and she agreed to pose as an assault victim, where her own children and husband would be the robbers. The plan went wrong, it cost her the life of her entire family, and prison for her.
>
>Security was injured and was intervened. He miraculously saved life, and is now seen by many as a hero for his courage.
>
>The events went viral on the world's social networks, due to the courage of security and how life was at stake confronting the assailants. He didn't have a bulletproof vest, just his principles of keeping bad guys from getting away with it.
>
>Without a doubt THE CRIME DOESN'T PAY!"
