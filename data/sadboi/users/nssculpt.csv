TheBrewery,fm10tk6,t3_fs8at8,1585669896.0,"Cidermaker from IA checking in.  Can confirm, our tap rooms and restaurant are closed, so we're only moving product through grocery stores.  We've basically put the brakes on all draft.  As for cans, well, even the distributor is asking us to wait several weeks before they even take a couple hundred cases.

Sadly, I think alcohol will always be considered ""essential"" in this country.  I'm proud of what I make, but I hate feeling as if I'm contributing to that culture which can be so detrimental to peoples health.  I've even been feeling my own concerns about my own physical health, now add a global pandemic on top of it? Oh boy here comes the anxiety!

Like the last guy, I also appreciate the paycheck and being able to have some income while so many others don't, but I also don't want to get sick or risk getting someone else sick if I'm carrying it and am asymptomatic.  Coming at a time that is normally the small window during the season that we aren't growing fruit and can take time off for vacations/recharge to avoid burnout, and that doesn't seem to be an option anytime in the near future.

So here's a drink for all my fellow craft producers out there dealing with excessive burnout and still showing up for whatever it's worth."

depression,es4ncm1,t1_es49usf,1561588939.0,"The first thing I would tell you is to work towards not making your job/career your life.  Why do you want a career?  Do you want something that you're going to spend decades doing or are you more interested in being more of a ""jack of all trades"" kind of person?
I'm really happy to hear that you're coming out of your depression. :)  I battled mine for a little over 10 years before I finally felt like I was able to leave that old me behind.  Do I still have shitty days? Sure.  I just bruised my ribs on Saturday and I'm off work for a week.  It sucks, but it's also nice.  I've been noticing myself getting burned out and I'm the kind of person that will not leave until everything is satisfactory, but I haven't been listening to my body and taking the rest that I need.  The bright side is now I have this time to rest. Haha.
As for finding a job, it'll happen.  I spent many years doing shitty barbacking work and retail, but somehow things worked out and now I'm working outside in an orchard and making cider!  Still have shitty days, but being able to create something that other people enjoy makes me feel really great, so I keep doing it despite all the bad days I have.

Hopefully some of this helps.  I don't think there is a concrete answer on finding your career or establishing a healthier lifestyle, but really at the end of the day, it's all on you with what decision you make.  Nobody else will have the final say in your decisions, but at least be mature enough to call yourself on your own bullshit, instead of thinking there's nothing you can do about your life and you'll be stuck this way forever, because you won't ever win that battle."
depression,es3tt3q,t1_es3fhi7,1561570487.0,"You see, that's it right there. You're doing it to yourself man.  There are always positivities you can look at. Did you take a shower today? Did you walk someone rather than drive? Did you have some bit of joy during the day that made you feel really good? Just knowing that and reminding yourself a out that are all positives. Theyre enough to make you feel good if you want to feel good, but the longer you stand in the puddle crying about being wet and not just taking a step out of it, then I think you'll keep playing the ""woe is me"" game.

I hope I didn't come off in an aggressive manner, but a lot of what I'm reading on this thread and your responses sound a lot like my older brother, who is 32 years old and has never left the nest or attempted to leave his dead end job that has caused him all sorts of physical and mental problems.  It makes me want to cry everytime I see him because I know that him and everyone else in his position can do so much more for themselves than they think.  You've got plenty of power over your situations."
