TMJ,eoa8xbu,t3_br5bzy,1558410178.0,"Peppermint oil has worked wonders for me. Also, I had retainers made and wear them quite frequently. This has helped me soooooo much. Also, moist heat works wonders. Ice helps. Tell him to not lay in any way that puts pressure on the jaws. 

Anti inflammatory medications such as naproxen, ibuprofen, help. Tylenol as well. Occasionally mine gets so bad I have to go into the hospital and they give me arthritic medications and these have helped me so much. 

I haven't found a cure all for my TMJ but with the proper attention to your body and learning the signs of a flare up / stressors that bring on flare ups, have helped me immensely. 

Best of luck to your husband, OP. 

One of the biggest things that has helped me, is my husband's patience and understanding with my chronic pain. Props to you for looking out for him and searching for help. Having that support while you're in pain is everything. üíö"
