I‚Äôve also heard of a couple little legends while living here. One of the first things I noticed was how stairs in houses often seem to be of different heights. Someone told me this is to keep spirits from being able to climb them. 

There‚Äôs also a belief that may come from Chinese myths about what to do if someone gets Mumps. You are supposed to find someone who was born in the year of the tiger. That person should circle your enlarged cheek with their fingernail. This will help heal you.

Finally, one of the most famous stories I‚Äôve encountered is Bpos Keng Kang (·ûñ·ûü·üã·ûÄ·üÅ·ûÑ·ûÄ·ûÑ). In this story, a lady falls in love with the snake king.

Edit: it‚Äôs gone again. Maybe DM it?"

productivity,fpg2ocj,t1_fpg02n3,1588592378.0,"This has honestly helped me a lot. Plus doing some intermittent fasting to get back to a normal weight. I have a pretty bad addictive personality, so I have a hard time sticking to doing things in moderation: eating, drinking alcohol, being lazy, etc. I have messed around with meditation before, but being isolated at home has really gotten me back into it. 

I also think not eating for 18-20 hours a day and only eating in the remaining 4-6 hours has helped make me a lot more disciplined. I‚Äôm just more conscious of what I‚Äôm consuming in that short window of time. I suppose that concept could be applied to other things that people tend to indulge in... drinking, being lazy, etc. Maybe set a window of time each day where those things are allowed, then restrict them when outside of that window of time."

Anyway, I thought they‚Äôd split up last year, so I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd be with him in photos. Maybe it‚Äôs an older photo."
