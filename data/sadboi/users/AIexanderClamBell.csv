If you start doing research things make sense, but again, I'm no professional and we all have our own believes. I'll try to find you studies. I listen to lots of health podcasts to get my info I'll look for the raw studies peer reviewed ect. Check out his bio:

I know I sound crazy but multiple health issues of mine have been solved by listening to people like Petter Glidden and Joel Wallach. The proof is in the data"
Drugs,femgera,t1_femeyol,1579254168.0,"Maybe it isn't on purpose, but doctors kill a staggering amount of their patients per year and take their quality of life away due to lack of education. It's sad that it's commonly preventable problems, they go about treating issues with pharma/designed chemicals that address symptoms, not cause. They fail us day after day with these man made chemicals. The body can heal itself when given raw materials along with diet change.

MD's don't even know how to cure acid reflux, which is caused by lack of acid. In their eyes it's stomach acid hurting you so they give acid lowering drugs. ""Acid reflux"" is caused by a lack of certian nutrients like salt and minerals, along with eating less simple sugars, refined and irritating foods! Mitigating bad bacteria from fermenting the food by nasty bacteria is step 2 of curing acid reflux. Step 1 is giving your body the nutrients it needs & that's it but doctors don't tell you this."
Drugs,feme44j,t1_femc7bw,1579250771.0,"Sodium and chloride are both essential cofactors for millions of chemical reactions in the body. There's people coming out saying increasing the amount of salt in ones diet, higher than the FDA recommends, yields better health in particular circumstances regarding heart issues.

There is studies, very old mind you, showing salt is not as bad as we're led to believe. You Google shit about salt and constantly there's the notion that too much salt fucks with your heart.. It's not true, I'm telling you guys... Doctors use this to sell you drugs paid by insurance companies, the lack of nutrients and poor diet are a contributing factor to the heart issue & overall disease.

Our soil practices today are fucked and we don't have trace minerals we need to develop as humans, diets are filled with processed food and simple sugars, people stressed all the time, no wonder we get sick with chronic disease. We go to doctors because insurance pays. You have nothing to lose by going, right..? No. Doctors cure things that require antibiotics or something of the nature, that's about it. They don't do a great job overall curing chronic diseases.

There's 90 nutrients that are literally essential for human life, and all must enter the body in some form in vairing amounts. We're all deficient guys! The only company that sells the 90 nutrients in an all-in-one package sells them at around $130 for a month supply. We need to figure out how to have cheaper access to them by increasing demand for them, that's something we need to achieve fast. We need a new manufacture that has the same health standards as Jole Wallach's company, just with a slightly more competitive price. Increase demand by spreading the knowledge of the 90 nutrients! Bye them no matter the price because your health and vitality are priceless.

Eggs are full of healthy cholesterol which the brain and body love. Doctors also tell you to limit cholesterol because of heart issues. You can eat over 4 eggs everyday for the rest of your life and be healthier than healthy. Hormones and cells need it.. the brain is something like 75% myelin and that stuff is made entirely of cholesterol if I'm not mistaken. High cholesterol is solved by certian minerals and diet change, again if I'm not mistaken"
Drugs,fem7ijw,t1_fem3ujh,1579242549.0,"Mushrooms sound so similar to lsd, I wonder if legalization of psychedelics would fix political and social problems if it were legal through the entire USA.

Think about it. Education would be key. Curious Americans would enviabley try it after it's legal in every state and we know the effects of psilocin in the brain after we establish comprehensive means of education. Enlightments would occur. Peoples personal issues shown to them and their potential in life and general. Again, I feel education is lacking with the general public. Set and setting, intention, ect y'all know. Not everybody can extract a good time but I feel even a bad trip is healthy so long as you have no mental issues and you integrate it properly.

The concerns of those mental issues being potentiated is there.. I think if every pregnant mother was on 90 for life essential nutrients, there wouldn't be any mental illnesses as most are caused by deficiencies. Mushrooms made me want to educate the public as I have a chronic illnesses and listening to the doctors make it worse as they don't treat illnesses, they make money off of them instead of giving them the nutrients which would cure so many disease.

Eat lots of eggs and salt (more than the government tells us), supplement with the 90 and see if it helps your quality of life."

Also my friend said he lost all motor skills after being told it was weed, but only lasted a short moment. I don't think it's from thujone alone. Salvia has many different compounds in it. They all are working together to make you feel a certain way, just like weed has terpines and other cannabinoids. I believe that's just what salvia does man.

I don't think you are hurting yourself by smoking or ingesting salvia. Don't be spooked, only in very high doses can thujone¬†can be toxic. Salvia is low in thujone.

Thujone is a GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric acid) inhibitor, meaning it blocks GABA receptors in the brain, which can cause convulsions if¬†you ingest enough of it. But again, plants don't make much of the shit"
