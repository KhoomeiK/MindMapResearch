They had large been dismissed, excluded and used as a “token” by white feminists and, understandably, they were angry about it. But my first reaction was to get defensive, I didn’t do these things to them. Defensiveness as a impulsive reaction is normal, doesn’t mean you’re a bad person and it doesn’t even mean it’s “who you are”. It’s how you proceed after the defensiveness which is important. What helped me was reassuring myself what I was reading was not a personal attack on me, as an individual. I used skills I’ve learned through meditation to move through those defensive thoughts and instead of letting myself place judgement on everything I read I tried to just understand what these women were saying. Not to say I’m cured of all shitty impulsive reactions, but that reading/watching/listening stuff about sexism and racism that doesn’t confirm your life experiences is a skill that is learned and must be exercised often."

My underlying hypothesis here is that many people who were diagnosed with ADD, CFS and fibromyalgia could have ptsd but most likely CPTSD because it’s not in the DSM and to get diagnosed with ptsd I believe you need to pinpoint a cause aka have flashbacks, but a lot of people with cptsd have emotional flashbacks which are not easy to notice unless you know about them. So my point is not that if you were diagnosed with ptsd you might actually have one of the other things but because of the way the system works, there could be a lot of misunderstandings and misdiagnosis. Also, CFS and fibromyalgia are not well understood because they are not broadly studied. I would be interested to read a study about these four diagnosis and their correlations."

If you look only at the recent White House press conferences and pay attention not on the problem he his addressing but purely on the way Trump forms his sentences and what the way he gets across his message, he is clearly a narcissist. I was raised by a narcissist, so to me the signs are clear. He is never wrong, he doesn’t apologize and just the shear amount of times he gives himself praise is a red flag.

Some interesting parts:

Furthermore, Ginde et al. found that the serum levels of vitamin D were inversely associated with upper respiratory tract infections,22 and it seems that exposure to artificial UVB radiation has a protective effect.23 We, therefore, propose that the seasonal variation of influenza death numbers is related to the seasonal variation of vitamin D status.


The death numbers start to decrease several months before the vitamin D level starts to increase significantly. This is likely to be related to induction of better immunity. Thus, influenza pandemies, starting outside the classical winter influenza season, have a duration of not more than a few months, but also in the case of classical pandemies, like the Spanish flu, 1918–1919, there came a winter wave after the initial wave.24 


In conclusion, our data are in agreement with the assumption that the high numbers of winter influenza and pneumonia deaths in Norway are related to low vitamin D levels in this season."

More often than not people rape to feel powerful, which is the same reason that the dom partakes in Bdsm. Another similarity is  that the sub is used for their body, which is one of the things that (in the past) has turned me on. Really, the only difference is that bdsm is consensual.

It irrevocably alters everything and to be told to move on is just hurtful and it just makes you hate yourself even more, like you’re faulty because you can’t just get over it."
TooAfraidToAsk,fk982v8,t1_fk95ll3,1583970650.0,"Thank you, I needed to hear that too"
TooAfraidToAsk,fk94ytd,t1_fk94dby,1583968811.0,"Ugh, I’m so sorry. It’s always so sad to hear there are so many of us.

I feel like the big distinction is discomfort with our brains/bodies for having that physical reaction to it. It’s like reinforcement of my self hatred. I hope you can slowly work through this and get to a place where you feel more positively about your sexuality. Wishing you all the best."
TooAfraidToAsk,fk8zyhz,t1_fk7eh14,1583966031.0,"I have to slightly disagree with this. Many women who have been sexually abused develop these “kinks” not despite of but because of the traumas they’ve endured. I was raped as a teenager and slowly developed a BDSM “kink”, which I put in quotation marks because it really wasn’t a kink. It was a desire to be treated like shit, demeaned, belittled, be used for my body. I couldn’t get turned on if sex wasn’t this violent, abusive act. And to add to that, I felt so so so fucking guilty about it. I hated myself for enjoying this, and for getting turned on by other women being hurt in this way as well, knowing that being treated in this way in such an intimate and exposing act effects them throughout their whole lives, as it has done for me. 

So while I don’t think OP is a horrible person for enjoying this, I don’t think telling them that there’s 100% nothing wrong here is the best way to go. OP, I know there are hundreds of comments here, but if you do happen to read this just know that while this is completely normal, if it makes you feel good but simultaneously makes you feel really fucking bad there are many resources out there to help you heal. With therapy, mindfulness, literature and the support of others I have been able to distance myself from both my desire to be treated like shit and the people who have treated me that way (not saying that your partner is abusive by any means, but I know the way that unresolved trauma seeps into all parts of your life, including relationships with lovers, friends, family, at work and of course your relationship with yourself). 

Basically, BDSM is fine, just make sure that you’re okay.

Edit: u/ThrowAwayPotatoCakes I see that you are subscribed to r/raisedbynarcissists it sucks to hear that you are part of the abused as children club. What has been helping me immensely is r/cptsd, and this man: http://pete-walker.com. Also I go to Adult children of Alcoholics and dysfunctional families (ACA) at least once a week. Having a supportive group of people who talk openly about their pasts and how it has effected them has, for real, changed my life. Look on their site and see if there are meetings near you, let me know if you are interested in any more information on this sort of stuff, I have dived quite deep into it so I’m more than happy to share."
CPTSD,fk80s65,t3_fgtub3,1583947205.0,"I identify with this SO damn much. And it has really shown itself in my relationships. I hate the idea of holding hands in public especially but any sort of pda is gross to me. I have a really hard time touching people, it feels like such a big step to even touch someone’s arm. I also despise when people say they “love” someone who they don’t actually love. When people say they love acquaintances or casual friends I always note that and if they ever say they love me then I have evidence to prove that it’s not true and I just don’t believe them, even if our friendship is much closer and stronger. Thank you for posting this, I’ve always struggled with this because I’ve often felt like people would like me more if I were more affectionate, but I literally can’t even give people complements. It’s really frustrating. I know logically that people love getting complements but I will somehow go out of my way to make sure people know that I’m not doing things for them..? It’s truly bizarre watching my own actions sometimes."
GenderCynicalCritical,fk53bua,t1_fk4wx20,1583872664.0,"Yup! That’s absolutely it. It’s tied into this way of thinking that goes something like “if you have ever done something that I think is ‘bad’ then all of your opinions, ideas, humanity, etc. is wrong”"
GenderCynicalCritical,fk4oxn2,t1_fk4o17q,1583864738.0,"The thought process is that the only reason that men would agree with gc ideas is because they want to maintain control as “cis white men”. And that women are allowing men to think and speak for them, and forming their opinions around the opinions of men. (This is obviously false, gc is literally the opposite thing). That idea is accompanied by the idea that trans people are the only minority that is mistreated in this equation, women have more privilege and they use that to keep trans people down (again there are so many holes in this). This all boils down to being able to blame the patriarchy for everything, including a large group of women (and some men) who see holes in the trans narrative."

CPTSD,fjlml2t,t1_fjkyz1w,1583449648.0,"Right? I had no idea. I never connected my constant guilt with my ptsd as I thought/think these thoughts are all based in facts and evidence. I constantly feel bad about not being a good enough friend, not checking in on people as much as I “should”, forgetting to offer someone water. I’ve never doubted my “I should be better” thoughts cause I just think it’s true, I should be better, I didn’t do everything I could’ve done, look ma! I’m self aware! It’s like the voice of my abusers are still there, constantly watching, monitoring and judging each action as “good” or “bad”, but it’s my voice and their mindset.

Ugh, so like, how do you “heal”?"
CPTSD,fj7dqpe,t1_f8ut6ue,1583090112.0,"These links were so helpful, thank you. I watched the movie “Honey Boy” last night which is about shia Labeouf’s childhood and PTSD. Cried throughout the whole thing. Woke up this morning and was so damn exhausted and all the body pain. It feels so ridiculous to say “I can’t function today because I watched a sad movie last night”, but these sources made me feel so much more validated. My brain doesn’t handle stress very well especially in regards to my past experiences, and that’s not my fault it’s just my animal brain and body doing things that I can’t control. So thank you again!"

GCdebatesQT,fib7zto,t3_f7dnvs,1582316477.0,For sure. I feel like what happened and is still happening is that a minority of trans people are *very* vocal and demanding and that gives them a bad rep in the rad fem community. I don’t/won’t necessarily agree with them on everything but if they were more respectful of women then their actions wouldn’t directly negatively effect women  and then it would be in the realm of “as long as it your beliefs don’t effect me negatively then idgaf what you do”
