I’m not saying I’m any  better but possibly look into the mirror and see if they’re the ones cutting you off or if you’re the one pushing them away with this “self medication” if they are checking your reddit and reading these than they definitely care about you to an extreme which is unfathomable to some of us living with this disease. Maybe they need to distance themselves for their own well being. There are many ways to look at the situation and until you get a diagnosis and get help I feel they’re doing exactly what needs to be done.

Edit: Typo’s, also this may not be what you want to hear but I feel this may be what you need to hear."
