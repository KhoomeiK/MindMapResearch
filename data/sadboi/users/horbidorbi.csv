anyyywayzz i have a ""couple"" of mods installed in my PC 
*ahem 95 mods ahem*


here are my ABSOLUTE  favourites (im listing down the mods i didnt see mentioned):

1.Starblue valley: it makes the scenery more blue xD it adds a  vintage feel to the game.

2.Seasonal Japanese Buildings: THIS ONE REALLLY GOES WELL WITH STARBLUE. Most of the buildings have a blue roof so it  r ea ll y  compliments starblue.

3.Talkohlooeys portraits: this mod is a godsend. THE CHARACTERS LOOK SO DISTINCT! The art is reaAL goodd

4.UI Info suite: I dont know what id do without this mod tbh"
