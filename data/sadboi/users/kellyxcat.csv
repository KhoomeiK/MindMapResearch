Parenting,fqr19nt,t3_gkannr,1589575726.0,I could go on for a long time about this subject but I’ll just say a few things and keep it brief. I basically agree with everything you said. I’ve seen a ton of child exploitation and it’s disgusting. We used to let our kid watch YouTube (he used to watch Ryan’s World and people playing video games) and it caused big meltdowns when it was time to turn it off so we don’t allow it at all anymore. The only thing I play on YouTube for my kids anymore is Raffi and they both love him and his songs.

lowcarb,fqqce3n,t1_fqq5y4m,1589563097.0,"Sure! I’m on mobile so this may turn out looking weird. I also eyeballed everything so I’ll do my best to give measurements. 

- 6 eggs whisked with a little cream and salt and pepper (I do it in a glass measuring cup with a spout for easy pouring)

- About 3/4 small head of broccoli, finely chopped and most of the stems removed 

- Sliced ham (today I used thicker sliced ham because that’s what I had in the fridge but I use lunch meat ham too)

- Your favorite shredded cheese

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400°
2. Stack the following in each muffin cup (I prefer silicone just put it on top of a baking sheet first):

- Ham slices at the bottom of each cup, followed by some broccoli and cheese. Slowly pour the eggs into each cup until it fills to the top - this might get a little messy but whatever. 

3. Bake in the oven for about 15-18 minutes. Just check to see if the eggs have cooked after 15 minutes and if they’re still a little wet and runny, throw them back in for a few minutes more."

bipolar,fpzzt7v,t3_gg67mw,1589026051.0,"I’ve had plenty of experiences with this in my adult life but I got lucky and found a guy who I feel I was destined to be with. I was officially diagnosed two years into our relationship but that was because I had a HUGE manic episode where I decided to get a divorce, lost my job, became homeless, spent all my money, you know, the usual. It was followed by the worst depression I had ever felt. So I got scared and reached out for professional help finally (I knew something was up for a long time though). Long story short, this man took me back and when we found out I was bipolar, it didn’t scare him off. He may not always know what to say when “my bipolar is acting up” but damn if he’s not the best thing that ever happened to me. I’ve never felt so loved and accepted before. 

So I guess what I’m trying to say is that there is someone out there who will love all of you."

bipolar,fmluzra,t3_fw16ur,1586193721.0,Is there anyone professionally that you can reach out to? I’ve been at an 8 before and it is so utterly terrifying. Try to hold on and call a mental health center for help ASAP. They may still be able to see you in person (if that doesn’t bother you) if you tell them this is a serious emergency. It helped save my life I hope the tip may help you too.
bipolar,fmlt7rg,t3_fw0tbw,1586192788.0,"The last time I had a full blown manic episode was right before my official diagnosis. In the blink of an eye i flipped my world upside down and made really impulsive and stupid choices, cringey mistakes, broke hearts, lost a job, became homeless, and drank all day everyday. After a few months of that, I felt myself calming down a little and slipping into a depressive episode. It’s just it all came back and hit me upside the head. I left the one person in my life who really truly loved me and for what? To party and have one night stands? Deep inside I just felt empty and lost which made the depression even worse. I am beyond relieved, happy, blessed, and more that my husband sat and tried to understand what was happening to me and we were able to rekindle our relationship. Funny enough and almost like in one of those cheesy Hallmark Christmas movies, we celebrated Christmas together so our son could be with both of us and that’s when we decided to try again. If not for that, I don’t know where I’d be or if I’d even still be here. I realized I really needed professional help for the first time in my life when I was contemplating suicide and day dreaming about how I’d actually do it. I couldn’t do that to my son so I got a psych, started meds, began seeing a therapist, and the relationship between my husband and I recovered and has been stronger than ever. 

I was lucky enough to have someone willing to help me during the crisis. One of the hardest parts about it to this day is the amount of guilt and embarrassment I feel about the way I behaved during my major manic episode. I’m slowly learning to forgive myself and keep the past and my mistakes in the past. I focus on the present and try to find ways to be grateful for the wonderful things I have. It really helps."
