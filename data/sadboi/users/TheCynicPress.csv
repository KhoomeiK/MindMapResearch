Anxiety,fr0sl4b,t1_fr0d8w3,1589805688.0,"This is an actual technique used by psychotherapists! It’s called exposure therapy, by exposing your self to the symptoms of anxiety, you desensitize yourself to it so your mind pays them no more attention.

Sometimes he’ll pop out of no where even if you’re feeling fine. Sometimes he’ll stay by your side all day. He’s worse when you’re falling stressed or negative. It’s normal to feel like shit and what’s special about anxiety is that he can come up with many different ways to make you feel shitty. Personally my anxiety kept changing symptoms whenever I got used to them, and that made it really hard to accept them as just anxiety and not something more serious. 
It’ll take time but it’s very important for you to speak with someone, preferably a psychologist or psychotherapist."

But since the beginning my family dismissed it as anxiety. Max I could get was a trip to the pharmacist to get my blood pressure and breathing checked out and that’s it. And nothing has felt normal since my first panic attack. Waking up and going to sleep are the worst parts of the day now. I lie to sleep and all I have to think about is how loud my heart is, how shallow my breathing is, how tight my chest is. And mornings are no better, I wake up feeling bad, but always a different type of bad. Sleeping used to be my favorite part of my life and nows it’s the worst thing I could be doing. The rest of day is either hit or miss. Before I managed to get it under control, I’d either be focused on my breathing and chest tightness all day or monitoring that mild pain in my heart or waiting for my head to idk snap off cuz it feels untethered to my neck. Once I got it under control I stopped doing all that n just enjoyed my day. I’m more scared of the symptoms of anxiety than anything else because they feel so fucking wrong. I don’t want this to be my new normal. I don’t to get panic thinking my heart stopped beating everytime I can’t hear it anymore. And now there’s these new symptoms to learn to live with?? If it even is anxiety. I don’t rlly have so many friends to rely on and the ones I do have are either too far away, not close enough to dump this issue on them, or I’ve already bothered them to Hell about anxiety."
Anxiety,fnyu5tz,t1_fnythct,1587375780.0,"Idk what’s wrong. For the past three months I’ve had chest tightness and weird symptoms that took a lot to finally accept is just anxiety. I’ve been doing okay last week, no symptom and my coping mechanism worked out just fine. Then two days ago I get stuck in bed with a fever all day. So that’s a whole day of being stressed out and delirious. The day after I feel better and not worried about it. But this morning I woke up feeling so _so_ wrong. My abdomen feels hallow, my mouth was so dry (even though I drank like 100cl of water last night,) my chest tight, I’m burping for no reason, my legs were numb, and I felt so weak. No fever though. I told my family and they don’t believe it’s serious. In fact they got angry at me for making it a big deal, and they asked ‘what happened? You were getting better!’ I say I want to see a doctor because I can’t believe it’s anxiety anymore and they get even more angry. They know I don’t speak the language here well, I don’t know any doctors, I don’t have insurance, I’ve never even made a doctors appointment, but they just ‘go see a doctor yourself! You have the money.’ I just break down in room because I’m fucking scared and I don’t have anyone to talk to anymore. My family is sick of me being scared if some “imaginary pains” and i don’t know what to do. I can’t tell what’s anxiety anymore this doesn’t feel like what I’ve been feeling the last three months."

It’s not just about how the animals “feel” anymore, it’s also about how this is another example of people putting their own wants over the health of the plant.
And don’t take people showing you vegan alternatives as saying you have to stop eating meat all together. Just consuming less meat will be enough to help the planet. Knowing other meat-free dishes can help with that.
