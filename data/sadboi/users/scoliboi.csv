depression,fj8sura,t3_fc0hoy,1583121324.0,I definitely have depression because of my anxiety. Overthinking never ends and I'm always jumpy and the feeling on not knowing why just makes me feel like shit.
depression,fhynpm4,t3_f51oky,1581979747.0,I think that's how a good amount of us feel. If my dad ends up passing I think I'll just end it cause I don't want him to know his own son killed himself. I've been living for other people for years I don't even know what it feels like to live for myself anymore. I understand how you feel
depression,fh6q915,t3_f1djgl,1581303440.0,I think so many of us can say we understand how this feels! It sucks cause it's so shit feeling sad all the time but I've adapted to feeling that way for so long it's almost like my brain strives for it. I think we just aren't used to feeling happy anymore to the point where it feels like we aren't allowed to and our brains just let off all these alarms and put us back in that sad depressey state of mind.
depression,felfh1f,t3_epm2ch,1579220932.0,"My ex did not same to me very recently, she was fed up with my depression and i tried hard for her. I wasn't near close to marrying her but i loved her. It'll get better for you, cause if you're going to marry someone then they'd be there for you no matter what and will be there even if your depression is overwhelming. It took me a while to realize that. You'll find someone who will do all that for you and more, just gotta pull through"
depression,fek2wlv,t3_epj329,1579191465.0,I can definitely say that all of us can understand this very well. Also your name me laugh and that's been diffcult for me lately so thank you
depression,fdwycyk,t3_en7336,1578763495.0,I definitely understand that and it's such a confusing feeling too. This is why I consider depression like a parasite cause it's just latched onto us. It does feel like it's become a part of me and I think that's why it's harder to get rid of it now because my personality has adjusted to being gloomy and sad all the time now.
depression,fdsao64,t3_emrpqy,1578698238.0,"Hey, my birthday was last month, December 10th. I had nobody to celebrate with except my dad. He took me out to eat and did his best to make sure i was happy. I understand how ya feel. I'm 17 now and I wasn't looking forward to it cause i figured my birthday would be pointless. Anyways i understand what you feel like and happy birthday man i hope you enjoy the rest of your day and congrats :)"
depression,fdoyuii,t1_fdoxxqm,1578616008.0,"It makes me feel better to talk to someone who's goin through it, and I'm sorry to deal with all that man it sounds like shit, but I'll take your word for it so I have a little more confidence it'll get better. I hope you get better too nobody deserves to go through all that"
depression,fc234bj,t1_fc22wnb,1577338486.0,I really really hope so

depression,fbz49fx,t1_fbz40y7,1577234618.0,"Using isn't gonna make anything better it'll make it so much worse. Ive done acid so many times it's fucked up my life, and i know if i do it again it's gonna get worse. It might seem hard but if you can stay out of the house as much as possible, you'll be less likely to be blamed. If you get drug tested and you're not clean all fingers are gonna point towards you."
depression,fbz3q62,t1_fbz3elj,1577234154.0,Maybe get someone to help you out? Or defend you at the least. Your brother shouldn't treat you like that

Anxiety,fblqfvm,t3_edvreb,1576967629.0,"It's different for everyone really. I'm extremely cooped up to myself because I feel like nobody will care what i have to say, and I'm incredibly antisocial, but when I play Xbox with the few friends i have it makes me feel a lot better since I can get my mind off things when we're all having fun. Basically do what is fun to you and can leave you with a happy mindset. Anxiety attacks are terrifying and feel horrible, but I'm sure you'll pull through just keep a positive mindset. I believe in you :)"
Anxiety,fblq2mj,t3_edu0js,1576967364.0,That happened to me a few months ago. It became so bad i didn't eat for five days and i had to force myself to eat. My friend knows i like pizza but when he brought it up I felt almost sick to my stomach. Eventually it passed after I fixed and maintained a regular eating schedule
Explainlikeimscared,fblp735,t3_edv1nk,1576966727.0,"Use Reddit or discord maybe? You can find and socialize with so many people on either site or join a public club that catches your interest? I don't know how to exactly start, i met the girl I'm with just by trying to look for friends but she's amazing, so maybe look for someone you can call a friend first then get to know them much better. I'm no where near a pro at this but I'm trying to help haha"
depression,fbl9gno,t1_fbl84oz,1576959897.0,"I'm considering going to one yea, but i would like to talk about it too, even I'm not exactly sure why it's so hard for me to move on"

depression,fak5p6b,t1_fak50l0,1576161358.0,"I understand, everytime I got close to deleting them i would stop myself and start crying. After I finally got rid of them i actually felt better, although I still miss reading them, I feel a little more in control of myself"
depression,fajb1c9,t3_e9gibw,1576130229.0,"I used to look through my exes texts cause it brought back the old happy memories and made me smile, but it just felt weird and shitty since we haven't talked in over a year. I finally deleted them and stopped forcing myself to hold on to something that won't hold onto me. I'm doing my best to start over and I found a girl who makes me happy and keeps me that way, unlike the texts that i know I'll never receive again. Try to find new people to talk to or interact with, you'll probably be happy with the results and have someone who can make you happier than reading old texts :)"

depression,faa0xyl,t1_faa0jvi,1575899052.0,"That does help i really appreciate it, i do have some motivation but it's easily killed by the overthinking and it's really hard to stop doing that since it just sorta happens. I know when I turn 18 i won't have everything planned out but having the title as a legal adult is nerve wracking on its own and I trying to enjoy being a kid as long as I can."
depression,fa9zw4v,t1_fa9zl5s,1575898116.0,I'm sorry about that. Have you at least been happy during your birthdays? I feel like I'm gonna have to put on a fake smile tomorrow for my 17th and it's just gonna make me more upset. And i understand because it feels like I turned 16 just a couple months ago and time is passing so fast
depression,fa9zk3v,t1_fa9z3z5,1575897800.0,"I know! It's horrible, the overthinking makes it unbearable and it just sucks. I'm happy someone else understands how that feels though, everyone else i know is so excited to turn 18 and leave and I'm not sure why"
depression,f6y0zte,t3_dtf8b5,1573264408.0,I literally can't describe how I relate to this. There's times I try so hard to cry I get pissed off. I wish I could at least shed a tear so I can feel somewhat like a human being

LucidDreaming,euho1o4,t3_cgdrva,1563830894.0,"Hey, i experienced something similar, for some reason i easily get sleep paralysis sleeping on my stomach, but the last time i had it i heard lots of ringing in my ears, then voices, then i thought i woke up but somewhat astro projected walking into another room, i could control myself, but didn't know i was in a dream till much later"
LucidDreaming,euhnmr2,t3_cgfju3,1563830670.0,"I've heard auditory hallucinations as well l, but ive only heard it from sleep paralysis before slipping into a lucid dream. Its just incredibly loud ringing like a bomb went off and the ringing subsides and I'll either hear two different voices whispering out of each ear or just lots of voices, then slipping into a dream"
LucidDreaming,etm8ur3,t3_ccdgml,1562954575.0,"I felt this about two nights ago, its the first time I've ever felt it but it was really intense and felt like my body was on a subwoofer or something. It woke me up when i tried to touch ocean water in my dream, as soon as i touched the water my hands felt like all the nerves and cells started shaking and startled me so bad i woke up"
