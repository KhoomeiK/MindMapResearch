depression,fhwthv3,t3_f4z2bu,1581929430.0,"28 at end of this year, I relate to what you feel, other than fear and anxiety, I rarely feel anything.
I don't have anything that make me excited to pursue it, be it money, woman or even progression in game I play.
No matter of much / how little time I sleep I still feel weak and tired, even feel asleep is hard as most of the time i just lay on my bed awake for hours


From around june last year I try running short distance / walking long distance and it help me feeling a bit better, not really drastic change but after that I can sleep better and wake up a bit refreshed and energized and for that day my mood is generally better (not always working though), but it still hard for me to do that or to make that a routine, maybe i only do that twice or thrice a month


Reading post about other here who suffer same with me, I want to help other because I know how it felt, and I don't want anyone suffering from this, but it is very hard for me, even like replying post of other, I often take my time to composing my thought to reply, then I just not replying it because I don't think it gonna matter anyway

I hope you find a way to lessen your suffering and someday your day becoming brighter"

Right now i'm trying to taking care of the nutrient balance in my meal, taking supplement, and start exercising by walking long distance because right now i don't think i can handle other exercise and if I'm tired on the way or want to stop I can just get bus and go home. now, there's some improvement as sometimes I can wake up feel neutral or even energised for few hours after I wake up."

I do this all the time eventhough logically  I'm very fortunate with everything i have rn in my life , and still I can't accept anything in me is good.

Try to ignore your mind when it's telling you that you are bad and worthless, it's hard and i've been trying for years to do that, but sometimes it succeed and I can enjoy my life for a bit without feeling like a shit.

It's like I'm a pizza from sadness dough with some slice of feeling good as a topping, If that even make sense

I'm just back from 2 days of voluteering works of playing with and help children learning, in the first day i separate myself and hide for like 1hours from the activity because I suddenly feel so deeply sad, and in days 2 I suddenly break and cry on the bus, good thing I can cover my head and just pretend that I sleep at that time, even though I actually enjoy these 2 days
