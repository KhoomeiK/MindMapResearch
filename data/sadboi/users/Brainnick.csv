exchristian,fpuh35k,t3_gfcfcc,1588912728.0,"In 2018, when I was 21, I was an avid practicer of the Law of Attraction (which I still am today) one day, I came across a comment on a YouTube video claiming the LOA was rooted in Satanism, which of course scared the shit out of me. Next thing I knew, I was seeing a bunch of videos claiming this, and talking about how they left the ""New Age"" spirituality for Christianity, and I ended up converting strictly out of the fear of going to hell. I never wanted to be a Christian, I just did it out of fear. I tried so hard to receive the holy spirit, and I did everything I could. I fasted, prayed, gave up my ""sins"", etc. but I never got any further. It drove me absolutely mentally mad, and I was just begging ""God"" for anything to prove his existence.  I went from actually feeling happy and content with life, to mentally ill for the first time, and severely depressed. I was a Christian for several months, until I one day (unintentionally, actually) found this article online debunking so many lies of Christianity, and it made me feel so much better. The thing that really helped me officially stop believing in the religion was certain YouTube channels. DarkMatter2525, The Atheist Experience, Evid3nce, and there was one more I can't remember the name of, but he had ""43"" in his username.

&#x200B;

These channels helped me begin my deconversion, and it took me several more months for me to fully get over my fear of hell and Jesus, as I had pretty much been fully brainwashed into believing that crap. I eventually went back to practicing the spiritual beliefs that makes me happy, and it's my personal belief that God is not a separate entity looking down on us from the sky who's cool with beating slaves and fucking your daughter, but shrimp and weed are a no no, but God is consciousness itself.

However, when I got into it again in 2015, weed became extremely visual. First time I smoked by myself, it was such a heavily psychedelic experience. Open eye visuals, amplified thoughts etc. I only recently learned a lot of people actually don't have these psychadelic experiences on weed alone.

I've tried it and had successful results in the past, but I was still unsure of whether or not it was placebo. The science is that mangoes contain mycrene, a terpene that increases the bioavailability of THC. A single drop of lemongrass oil contains like 10x more mycrene than a dozen mangoes. I diluted 4 drops of lemongrass oil in a tablespoon of coconut oil, rubbed it on my arms, and waited an hour. I have a pretty decent tolerance built up over the 5 years I've been smoking. But when I hit that bowl, it was the most intense high I had in years. I had the closed eye visuals, slowed down perception of time etc. again for the first time in many sessions. It was the closest thing I ever had to a psychedelic experience. Everything around me just seemed so dream like and surreal. I felt like I was actually one with the universe for once. I've been blasted many times, but this time was different. I wasn't disassociated with reality, but I almost could perceive for once what ""imagination"" truly is."
