Philippines,fmgro68,t1_fmfuhws,1586056030.0,"Kaya malala ang miscommunication sa pilipinas ngayon dahil maraming pinapangako ang nasa taas na hindi ipinapaliwanag ng maayos sa mga Pilipino. Sa ngayon dami na rin nambabash sa LGU‚Äôs and BLGU‚Äôs kasi hinihingi nila yung ipinangako ng nasa taas. Umaaray na rin yung mga local officials kasi kung hindi limited ang funds na nasa kanila, hindi pa dumarating yung galing sa taas na pondo. Kagaya sa relief goods, sasabihin sa taas na lahat mabibigyan walang pipiliin pero pag limited lang fund mo sa baba, uunahin mo yung mga pinakamahihirap. Also amelioration, dami nagrereklamo kasi hindi 5-8k ang natanggap nila, hindi sila nakikinig sa explanation ng local officials and DSWD kung bakit hindi buo ang natanggap nila, nakatatak na sa isip nila na 5-8k ang dapat nilang matanggap. At ipinangako ng Presidente na walang babayaran sa ospital ang mga tatamaan ng covid19 pero wala pa akong nakikitang lumabas sa ospital (patay man o buhay) na hindi umaaray sa laki ng babayaran nilang bill."

BreakUp,fmgpnnp,t3_fv2u0a,1586054554.0,I think he really wants to break up with you and used this situation to put the blame on you. You di everything you could and tried to fix the relationship and he was being too harsh on you. Move on and dont look back on him. He‚Äôs in the past now.

It was so hard for him to tell you he loves you but it only took him a little time to tell you that he doesnt love you. You should believe him. You did what you could and you should be proud for giving so much love in spite of this. Pick yourself up and move on. You deserve your own cheerleader too.
RedPillWomen,fjbmow4,t3_fce5yr,1583196769.0,Maybe he was depressed with his situation and your presence has become overbearing. Give him some time to clear how he feels within himself. Give yourself some space too. I think both of you need it.

You did the right thing. Accept the fact that your story with her is over and hope that someone is out there for you. And she‚Äôs closer now.
