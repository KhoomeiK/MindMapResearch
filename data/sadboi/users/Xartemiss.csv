The more they pull at me, the more I pull the other way. Adding extra pressure and obligation makes it worse for me. As for what can you do, it depends only on her, and you, so maybe ask directly.

Advice,esip2zg,t3_c7zycl,1562017616.0,"If it makes you feel more comfortable at the moment, start home. It's not at all a waste of time. Anything that makes you feel stronger and healthier and better in your goal is not a waste. There are plenty of at home workouts, you could buy a couple of dumbbells, or ankle weights to add a little difficulty to your exercises, and just start building muscle bit by bit. I don't have a lot of knowledge in this area, you might want to ask a fitness community, but you also need to adapt your diet to this, to get better results. Also you could try any sports you like, jogging, biking, yoga, basketball, swimming etc. Once you get your blood pumping, you'll start having a little more energy, the happy hormones will also help, you'll feel more comfortable in your body, a little more confident and then maybe you could retry the gym. Ultimately, you are the one who knows what's best and what feels right for your body. As a person with a lot of anxiety who occasionally goes to the gym and loves it even if the first 20 minutes are filled with anxious thoughts, I can tell you it's awesome once you get used to it, get used to the machines and usual faces. That feeling in your muscles and body after a good workout is great and you'll love it once you find the right activity for you. All the best!"
Advice,esimsqx,t3_c8047a,1562016448.0,"As another person with anxiety, I understand some of your struggles. Your work-living situation seems tricky, and as I don't know how things are where you live, can't really give advice on that. But as for the anxiety, I can give you my opinion on an angle you could take. What do you enjoy doing? What activities attract and wish you could try them? For me, doing something I enjoy, even if it's small, gets me out of the anxious headspace   for that time. Finding a hobby you love can give some independence back, you can learn new stuff, maybe later you could turn it into a revenue, maybe it will take you to a place where people with the same hobby gather, thus meet new people. I am scared of many things too, you are not alone. Take care and hugss"

AskMen,ervtr3m,t1_ervr5ur,1561324826.0,"Never heard of Solzhenitsyn. As for Frankls Mans search for meaning, just finished rereading it a few months ago. So, on point suggestion :D. Had to do a little search for Romanian authors because I honestly had no idea which were translated. Most of them weren't, and even if they were, I'm not sure if the translations are good, since the authors are not so popular. Much of the 'charm' of a Romanian book, comes from the creative and diverse use of language, at least to me, so that might be lost in a bad translation. Looked a bit on bookdepository.com and found 'I'm an old commie!' by Dan Lungu (really liked this book) and the classic Mircea Eliade with 'Bengal Nights' (not a huge fan of this one, but some love it) or 'Diary of a Short-Sighted Adolescent' (school read that was great). Haven't found any of our old classics tho. Thanks for reminding me to watch Comrade Detective :D"

AskMen,ervn834,t1_ervk7xw,1561320150.0,"I have wondered about this but to be honest, haven't found my favorite author yet. I jump from one to another, and I think it's kinda random, based on my mood when I'm buying/borrowing the book. In the last months I really loved reading Murakami and de Botton. Genre wise it's either fiction which focuses more on the character development and relationships or non fiction looking for the meaning of life or personal experience books. Also mix international writers with those in my country- love reading in English and Romanian.  How about you? What are your favorites? All suggestions for future reads are very welcomed."

I'm not from the US and just heard of Ted Bundy from media saying he was a psychopath. Also had an ex really manipulative and with other bad traits. So I got curious and started reading around on the subject. As I recall psychopaths don't feel empathy at all, for no one, they just fake any emotion to get their way. On the other hand sociopaths might have feelings and some empathy towards family and people close to them, but not others. I'm no expert and don't pretend to be one, but this person sounds like a legit sociopath. You might be tempted to excuse her because she is nice to you...for now. She either needs a psychiatrist or is just a bad person, pretty on the outside, ugly on the inside. And I'm pretty sure if you stick around you'll end up manipulated and in God knows what situations. I hope you can remain as rational as possible when taking decisions regarding this person. All the best OP!"
