SuicideWatch,f9h78l7,t3_e4vvro,1575310257.0,"sad to hear someone else has to deal with this shit aswell. If I'm honest I'm still dealing with it all and I doubt my methods of coping are great since I've nearly OD'd twice at this point. It's a sad reality but I can tell you this it does get better. Over the last 2 years I've managed to find friends that matter beyond belief and a purpose again it all comes with time so dont ever throw your life away because of their impulsive and frankly sickening nature. I get it I really do but its gonna be shit for a while until you do something about it because it took me far too long to dig myself out of this well of self pity I'd built. You'll get through it and are worth far more than whatever your parents may say so please stay alive if not for others, then yourself because you deserve it."

socialskills,f8rz00y,t1_f8r0q41,1574760359.0,that's kind of the hard part I'm deep in the friendzone beyond belief she's confusing and idk I've been friends with her for maybe a year now and I still barely understand her and sadly I dont think that will work. I'm first team starting for my rugby team and I'm already doing well in school but she doesnt really care about that and is instead focused on other things for guys and it's kinda shitty I guess
socialskills,f8qy3ew,t1_f8qrb2f,1574727110.0,I dont know tbh I was at her house this weekend and it just burst out at me like how out of my league she is I guess
