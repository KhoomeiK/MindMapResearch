Anxiety,fmuphrg,t1_fmuiafx,1586396093.0,Grazing is a great idea. So often I find myself thinking about food as a big meal and it completely turns me away.

Anxiety,fmmt22g,t1_fmmc7z0,1586211533.0,"Yes, very extensively too. But he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand or whatever is happening in his life that‚Äôs causing stress is far more important than our relationship or the panic attacks it‚Äôs been causing me. I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything. It feels like because of anxiety I turn all my intimate relationships into toxic ones and then I blame myself. I feel like there‚Äôs no one out there who will understand and be supportive when I really need it even when they are going through their own shit."

EDM,fkbviyq,t1_fkbv04b,1584040688.0,Interesting. But it doesn‚Äôt sound for sure and you would think they would email all the people who bought tickets or have some legit announcement like coachella or ultra did.
EDM,fkbupsg,t1_fkbu2mz,1584040243.0,Whatttt where did you see that??
Anxiety,fk39d7h,t3_fg9ivf,1583822760.0,"I recently started taking klonopin 2mg a day. A half of 1mg in the morning, the other half in the afternoon and a whole one before I go to bed. At first this reallllly worked for me as I‚Äôd been struggling heavily with anxiety but about a month later, which is where I‚Äôm at now, I feel like I‚Äôve built a bit of a tolerance and now I‚Äôm experiencing more depression than anxiety. I‚Äôll be seeing my Dr this week though and I‚Äôm curious what he will say. Also to answer your question, my dr told me this is perfectly safe as I had the same concerns as you. And he even told me I have to weigh the pros and cons because my life before taking klonopin daily was realllly hard for me. So that‚Äôs ultimately what made me say ‚Äúyah I‚Äôm gonna do this even though I‚Äôm worried about what effects it will have long term because I can‚Äôt live like this‚Äù."

Anxiety,f6yil52,t3_dtqhz9,1573281757.0,How much do you take and how often?? I‚Äôve recently started using CBD as well and I think it helps but I‚Äôm struggling to find a routine with the dosage.
Anxiety,f6yie8r,t3_dtqpl5,1573281500.0,At some point you will just have to learn to trust. I struggled very hard with this in my last relationship and ( although he was extremely verbally abusive) I inevitably pushed him away because I kept doing this and we eventually broke up. Now I‚Äôm in a new healthy relationship but still find myself wanted to ask the same questions over and over but I‚Äôm starting to realize that in order to have healthy relationships with those around you it‚Äôs important to trust what they say the first time.
Anxiety,f6oyrq5,t3_dsesw7,1573041556.0,I love this! I‚Äôm so proud of you!! This is honestly such a nice / comforting community to be a part of because even those who are struggling can help those who are struggling so thank you for sharing your story.

Anxiety,f6nzfmp,t1_f6nxwyr,1573003920.0,I feel like it‚Äôs either one or the other with anxiety :(
Anxiety,f6nzbom,t1_f6nz10q,1573003840.0,That‚Äôs a good point. A lot of times I just wanna get it over with so I‚Äôll try eating quickly and that makes it worse. Even trying to eat at a normal pace is hard. Definitely gonna try slowing it down a bit.
