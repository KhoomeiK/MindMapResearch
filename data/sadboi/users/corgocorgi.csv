Skincare_Addiction,fql0bo6,t3_gjbitc,1589441890.0,"I'm not a fan of the walnut shell powder, fragrance, isopropyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol. All of these can cause issues especially if you have sensitive skin. However, I think it would be fine to use on your body instead! Since the skin on other parts of your body are thicker, using this shouldn't cause too many issues unless you have very sensitive skin.  You could even maybe use it on your lips but it might taste bad so if you accidentally get some in your mouth that wouldn't be the best lol. It's a shame because this scrub actually has awesome ingredients besides those I mentioned above, if they used a gentler type of bead and got rid of the fragrance and alcohols it would be a pretty nice product!   


I advice against using physical exfoliators on the face if possible BUT if you must use them, try going for ones with sugar or ingredients that break down so they aren't as rough on the skin. Shells are jagged and can cause irritation and inflammation. There is debate about microtears but one thing to keep in mind is that if the shells are jagged they can apply uneven pressure or exfoliation which isn't the best. ALSO, if you do use them, do not use them more than once a week. It is not ideal to use but if you must, please refrain from using it too often. I like sugar scrubs mixed with a cleansing oil as it also adds some nice lubrication and moisture. I used it in the past and it didn't irritate my super sensitive and dry skin but I haven't used it much as I prefer to stay away from physical exfoliators as they cause too much sensitivity and inflammation for my type of skin."

For when you get the chance, I highly recommend getting some natural wood perches of varying sizes to make sure they are working their little feet. Birds are prone to a condition called bumble foot where their feet get swollen due to lack of movement and this mainly happens when they only have the dowels that are included in cages or just perches of all the same size and texture. In nature, birds land and perch on a variety of things and this naturally helps them exercise their feet and it's very important for them! I would also try experimenting with giving them veggies and fruit asap so they can explore and get used to them soon! I hear stories of people waiting and their birds being so used to not eating them that they don't really care for veggies or fruit and it prevents them from having a fully nutritious and balanced diet! My birds love leafy greens being hung by one of their perches and it's a fun thing for them to rip up and munch on :). They also love carrot because they see it as a chew toy haha.   


I wish you and your little bird babies the best !!!"
offmychest,fq1vw2i,t1_fq1i12x,1589050124.0,I think the same! They feel insecure in the shots they missed and project that onto others and make them feel like they need to reach their perception of reaching potential even though it's quite subjective.
offmychest,fq1uk3i,t3_gghu0t,1589049549.0,"I think there is that stupid mindset that if you don't get a lot of education or people that work in a more entry level positions and don't want to move up that ladder into a more 'prestigious' position are not ambitious or hardworking.  It's also very disrespectful to those who do that work and help those in their most vulnerable times. You should do what makes you happy and what you are passionate about, no matter what level it is or how much education you need for it. As long as you are happy and are okay with the money you get, that's all that should matter. Not everyone is interested in money, status or power and to not want to be at the top or have the most credentials shouldn't be something to be ashamed of. If someone is doing what they are set out to do and do it well, then they should be supported for it. Many people that are considered to work in lower jobs work their damn asses of and have a huge impact on the lives of those they care for or provide services for. Many people deserve to get paid more but because compensation is often decided by amount of education more than the actual work itself, those who don't go to school for 6+ years are seen as not deserving of better wages. Not to say that people that go to school that long don't deserve to be paid well, they for sure do and having more education and experience is very important but to make it out like healthcare aides or education assistants aren't skilled or deserve a decent wage is ignorant. These people make a difference in peoples lives even if they don't have loads of education on their belt.

I feel the same way a lot when it comes to friends and people around me. I'm in social sciences (psychology) and want to help those that are marginalized like youth or women that are on the streets or struggling with addictions and other mental illnesses. I also have an interest in helping children and youth with developmental disabilities and administering assessments. However, most people around me are in healthcare or STEM careers and look at human or social service careers as being quite low level and not as important. Most don't say that right out but you can tell that's how they view it by the way they talk about it and conceptualize it. They trivialize their contributions and make it out like society doesn't need them. I think we need a variety types of careers and levels of educated individuals in the workforce. We can't have all of one or the other as it would neglect areas in the world that need to be addressed. We need engineers and computer scientists as much as we need those in human services that will help and advocate for those less fortunate. There needs to be a people that dedicate their lives to helping the homeless secure stable shelter and employment and transition from living on the streets to being a part of the working society. We need people that will help those with addictions and even provide sanitary tools to ensure harm is reduced. We need people that want to help special needs kids excel in the classroom and also assess and relay important information regarding development and progress to their families just as much as we need nurses and doctors to care for people. We need researchers that will test our drugs meticulously to ensure they are safe for human use and we also need people that are willing to care for people in their last stages and most vulnerable parts of life and need to have their butts wiped. There needs to be less focus on the income and monetary aspects of careers but what different workers do for society and how we each contribute in a meaningful way. Yeah someone that is a special education assistant isn't making anywhere near what a doctor or engineer makes but that doesn't make their contributions any less important or mean they aren't as hard working or ambitious.   


Sorry for rambling but I get pretty passionate about mental health and helping those less fortunate and get riled up when people make it out like what I do isn't important because I'm not a nurse or doctor LOL."
relationship_advice,fpz4pjx,t1_fpyl49p,1589013567.0,"Hey! Yeah, it is very hard to try to relate to those who fall in a different spectrum and I think it feels a bit foreign to me at times because I can easily empathize with so many people on various things. And I've also gotten a bit jealous when my partners commented on other girls looks too! I don't really care or pay too much attention to attractive people and I'm not really the type to point them out or balk over cute or hot boys like other girls. I can definitely acknowledge when someone is attractive but unlike others who care more about that, I just notice it and move on and it doesn't phase me at all. So I did find it hard when my partner would point attractive girls out because I didn't understand why. He's also a photographer so I think it's like his mind is always taken in attractive people and acknowledging them and it's just so natural for him he doesn't even do it in a ""omg she's so hot"" way but more in an appreciation of looks I guess? But yeah he stopped doing it when I told him it made me uncomfortable and he tries to understand my experiences with it and find its hard to at times since it's so different from himself. We've been together for almost 3 years (anniversary is at the end of this month) and it's been brought up a couple times but it's more in a reflective manner it seems. I think it stems a LOT from his childhood and low self esteem. He is a POC and from a group that is often seen as feminine and emasculated in mainstream social media so I think it's made him super self conscious about himself and his sexuality. It's also toxic masculinity too and feeling pressure to be this big machismo man who is a sex god. He's not Chris Evans or the Rock but he's attractive and fit but doesn't feel attractive or sexually desirable because he doesn't fall into the stereotypical mold of what is considered to be sexy (which is honestly not true because women like a wide range of types of men and a lot of those standards are set by other men tbh LOL). But yeah I think it really stems from that just feeling not sexy or desirable due to this and I guess thinking that because he hasn't slept with a lot of women it confirms that he isn't sexually desirable. It kind of seems like he viewed sex as a way to prove that he's attractive and a form of validation to prove against negative stereotypes he sees about his ethnicity. He's slept with a fair amount and I tell him that he's sexy and a lot more charismatic than he thinks he is but he struggles with it. He always reassures me though and says that it has nothing to do with me and that I'm a great partner and he loves me but I guess because I can't relate and because I deal with sexuality so differently I still get insecure about it. I also get insecure because it reminds me how different I am when it comes with sexuality and I get too much in my head too. I just don't understand why people fantasize or wish to have multiple partners because I never cared for that. If it happens, it happens but I never really desired to have a lot of partners or fantasize about it because it's already so hard for me to actually desire sex with a person in the first place. So I just can't relate at all and because I don't understand it it feels uncertain and scary to hear about it from a partner LOL. I'm definitely thinking too much and ruminating about it more than I should be though.

That's such a common feeling for those who are demi and asexual! Feeling broken is a way I've always felt and I also thought I was asexual for awhile too. My family used to poke at me for it a lot when I was younger because they are all very open and positive about sex and for me not to be sexual in high school was very bizarre for them. They thought I was lesbian for the longest time (which there's nothing wrong with but it just felt frustrating for people to pry at my sexual life and orientation and make assumptions and put labels on me). That's a great way to put it and I think the various types of sexuality should be explored more and celebrated! I think every sexuality should be respected and people should have to feel weird for their preferences or experiences either! Thank you for your comment, it's always nice to hear from others perspectives who are also demi as it reminds me that I'm not alone! :)"

KDRAMA,fpegpvp,t3_gcv6df,1588547216.0,"This is why I've taken a step back from a lot of 'romantic' kdramas because as I got older I started to realize how toxic these traits were and how young girls are being shown that it's okay if your partner is a complete asshole !! This is why so many people go through such shitty and abusive relationships because media romanticizes it and makes it out like it's all dandy when in reality the way so many characters are treated by their partners in dramas, movies, etc are horrible and should not be tolerated AT ALL. BOF is the worst for this and now that I look back I just shake my head that that was such a staple for so many in terms of kdramas when the ML is an absolute piece of trash and everyone should have hated him and not rooted for the FL to end up with him.    


I've been actively not supporting dramas with this trope and try to avoid them. Some that I've noticed have better characters are Because This Is My First Life (One of my fav male leads in this one haha), How to Buy A Friend, Fight My Way, Itaewon Class (the female characters are pretty toxic in some ways though.. but male lead is a nice guy for the most part lol), Reply 1997, One Spring Night (this one is hard because there are abusive relationships but it's more of a commentary on it), Something in the Rain,Queen Inhyuns Man, Cheer up!/Sassy Go Go, Dream HIgh, Flower Boy Next Door, Bring It On Ghost, Kind of Oh My Ghostess (I think Jo Suk's character was a little cold but he wasn't an asshole imo) and Page Turner. There are a lot more out there but these are ones I've watched and can think of right now. I do have  some favourites where the MLs have been asses like Cheese In The Trap and The Innocent Man but I think what sets them apart is that everyone acknowledges they're assholes and aren't doing the right thing rather than pretending that the ML isn't if that makes sense."

University,fosef5k,t3_g99wb9,1588029095.0,"Like you said it really comes down to the work you put in outside of your degree and your connections. If you finish with a humanities degree and don't dive into things to strengthen your skills or take on things to show expertise you aren't going to get very far. For instance, both my partner and I have BA's in psyc. He graduated in 2015 and I just finished my courses this past December so I'm technically graduated this June. He's making the national average for Canada right now 4 years after graduating which is pretty good imo. Yeah it's not computer science or engineering salary but it all depends on what you want. Some people need to make over 70k a year while others are okay at 42-50k. Of course where I live in Canada we are lucky where 42-50k for a twenty something without kids is fine but if you live in some cities in the states even 75k isn't nearly enough so it really depends.

I know that for myself I have been trying to get certificates under my sleeve to improve my chances of getting hired. What I've been doing is trying to find certificates that employers have listed on various job postings for jobs I wish to work at. Being in mental health I have to have certificates like mental health first aid, non violent intervention, suicide intervention,   etc. I also decided to take a post degree certificate in mental health recovery which I hope helps show I have more specialized training. Through this course I learned about an immigrant and refugee mental health certificate which I'm taking right now too. I think showing initiative to get those extra things shows that you are passionate and serious about strengtening skills. I'm also ensuring that I have my first aid and CPR certificate too which helps. 

Idk what field you're in but I would look at potential certificates wanted by employers for jobs you want and get on that asap! Even smaller things like getting more familiar with excel and whatnot can look good. Also looking at volunteering with organizations you want to work at and reaching out to them personally to ask about careers or other opportunities. 

I think it all just depends on your initiative and ability to work hard on top of the degree when it comes to finding a career afterwards. People that think they're automatically going to get a job with just a BA or Bsc (unless they have specialized learning and practicums) are probably going to struggle more with finding something because they haven't shown initiative or commitment to the career path they wish to pursue. It's hard putting in extra work if you're already a student and working part time but it pays off in the end. There's many free training, certificates and workshops that can help you build confidence in skills but also meet people to network with!

Good luck!!! You got this!!"

However, when Wanna be came out I fell in love with the song and Ryujin's shoulder dance. After that I researched the members and watched some videos with them and started to become a fan. I re-listened to Dalla Dalla and Icy and like them more now! They aren't my favourite songs but because I've grown to like the group I like the songs more now I guess??? I love Wanna Be though and I'm looking forward to future songs from them!!! I've been growing out my hair for awhile but Ryujin's short hair looks so nice and I keep getting tempted to cut my hair!!!! I have such a girl crush on most of the members and want to be as cool as Ryujin. However each member has grown on me and I'm looking forward to following them :). 

I also watched Say My Name by Ateez and was indifferent and didn't really care for the group. I came across a video of them doing a challenge with the fine bros I think? Try not to sing and dance or something. And I found HongJoong super endearing and I decided to give Ateez a second chance. I listened to Answer and fell down the rabbit hole and started really liking them too! I re-listened to say my name and it was stuck in my head for days LOL. I've started to watch them on variety shows and whatnot too and find them fun and super talented. The first member to stand out to me was Mingi but I always was drawn to Hongjoong because he's super charismatic and hard working but also really sweet.

I find that when I start to get to know members of groups I start to appreciate their music more. I'll not like previous songs or debut songs but when they come out with a BOP I start to get more into them and re listen to old songs and like them more.

KoreanBeauty,fo5b9cm,t3_g5pbjf,1587521569.0,"I would just reflect on what you think your skin is missing and maybe use your toner to fulfill that missing aspect?I've used both Benton's Aloe BHA toner and Laneige's Cream Skin and loved them both for different reasons and would use them depending on how my skin felt. On days where my face felt a bit drier I would use Laneige while on days my skin felt more congested or inflamed I used Benton! I would be sure to be cautious about using toner with actives in them and only use them daily if they have small concentrations like Benton's bha toner. The Krave Kale-lalu-yAHA is good but unless your skin is pretty resilient and not sensitive you could maybe use it every other day but if it's more sensitive I think you could only maybe use it 2-3x a week.

These days you don't really even need a toner and a lot of people are advocating for not using one when your skin is doing alright without it! I prefer a treatment toner type product to use every couple days or at night to help my skin out but I don't even use toners everyday now and my skin has been alright (I have super dry, dehydrated, sensitive and acne-prone skin).  


For acne I recommend:  
\- Benton's Aloe BHA Toner  
\- Paula's Choice 2% BHA Toner  
\- Krave's Kale-lalu-yAHA (not for daily use though)

\- Isntree's Clear Skin BHA Toner

\- Iunik Tea Tree Relief toner  


For hydration/soothing:  
\- Laneige's Cream Skn Refiner

\- Cosrx's Propolis Synergy Toner

University,fo0utmn,t3_g522zy,1587420173.0,"Hmm.. I would make a pros and cons list for your circumstance.  


If I were in your position and was not financially strapped, I would probably go for the masters right away! You sound very motivated but there's always a chance of getting side tracked or having a harder time going back to school after taking a break. Plus your profs are suggesting you go straight for it which means you'll have some good references and they know your work ethic right away! Would you have to take your masters full time if you were to go for it now? Maybe if you're able to take it part time you'll also be able to work too so you can kill to birds with one stone! Taking a break before your phD would be an option too and if you get your masters sooner you'll be able to make more money before your phD and also have more job opportunities (depending on where you live of course).   


But if you are financially strapped and can't really afford not taking a break between them that is okay and working might be a better option. You still have great grades and references regardless so even if you don't go right away you still have very good chances of going later :)"

KoreanBeauty,fnv3lej,t1_fnuiena,1587279101.0,"Ooo. 3 months and barely using half is pretty good. I've had the Krave cleanser for about 10 months and I have about a week or two left. 

I think after I finish the Etude House cleanser I bought to replace the Krave one I'll try YTTP's. I've only heard good things about it and one of my fav skincare youtuber raves about it all the time!"
KoreanBeauty,fnu8mk2,t3_g3tbou,1587256810.0,"I think you may be over cleansing and that's why you're experiencing dryness. I don't know your skin type but I have dry sensitive skin and once I switched to using water to cleanse in the morning and only using cleansers in the evening it helped a lot. I use this cleanser too and I can only use it at night because using cleansers twice a day dried my skin out way too much. I like it and don't really smell anything but maybe because I've used it for so long I got super used to it's scent? ðŸ¤”

It could also be your actives too, how often do you use them? Could be a negative interaction that is causing the dryness and sticking to once a day and figuring out how often to use actives that suits your skin might help.

I do eventually want to try YTTP's cleanser too as I can't repurchase this cleanser because I live in Canada (I bought it in New York when they had a pop up). I just can't get over the price and how this cleanser is a more reasonable price imo. Also... is it okay to use it as a toner like you mentioned? Most surfactants need to be washed off and sitting on your face could do more harm than good. But I don't know too much about YTTP's cleanser so I don't know if they recommend that or not. 

It's unfortunate you didn't enjoy your experience and I hope you're able to find a good substitute!!! I bought Etude's House SoonJung whip cleanser to replace Krave's when I'm done and hope it's a good replacement for it. I prefer gel water based cleansers and I'm always pretty apprehensive for foam types but I hope it's okay for now lol."
University,fnu411j,t3_g3lw8w,1587254113.0,"I would think so, as long as you have pre-reqs related to education and some experience I'd imagine you could. I would check out the admission requirements for the masters program you're interested in to get information."
relationship_advice,fnta06o,t1_fnlwlks,1587237504.0,Mhm! It's a great suggestion though and the media we consume is VERY important in shaping how we view certain topics! So many people don't even realize it but it takes a huge part in our socialization.
Watches,fnt9hsg,t1_fnr5vbv,1587237213.0,"I'm starting be quite sold on the SNK and I'm getting excited about getting it. 

I have a question about purchasing it online though. Have you ever ordered watches off of Amazon? I live in Canada and a lot of retailers are in USD and the CAD is shite right now when converting so I'd prefer to buy from a Canadian source. I know that my partner has bought multiple casio's from Amazon with no problems but with them... they are a lot more affordable and even if they didn't work out it wouldn't be much of a loss. I've found a couple SNK's on Amazon that have quite a bit of reviews but I get pretty anxious buying things like this online :(.

I usually ask my partner for input because he's really good at this but I can't since it's a gift for him LOL."
KDRAMA,fnt9044,t1_fnj8jxy,1587236939.0,For sure! He isn't a horrible person and super unlikeable which makes it even harder and confusing to judge him when he does messed up things! In other shows it's easy to like or dislike characters and the characters are either great or horrible but with the characters in Cheese in the Trap.... all of them have good and bad traits that make it hard to really love or dislike any of the characters fully. I think Seol is the easiest to love and relate to but even she has some issues too.
KDRAMA,fnt8uh9,t1_fnk0vuh,1587236851.0,"I think it was so interesting to watch him because everything he did... was unsettling but you could understand his mindset to an extent and didn't feel really bad about his actions??! I think the name of the drama suits him perfectly tbh. He's the person trying to trap all the mice (shitty characters) and uses their flaws to entice and trap them!

That's a very good observation that I forgot about. He was constantly monitored and judged for his actions by his dad and some people around him and he started doing so with others. I can imagine feeling resentful seeing people get away with things when you are constantly held responsible for everything you do and I can see it being a huge motivation to micro-manage others and become nosy about their issues.

I think after talking more about him, I'm starting to understand his character more and appreciate it more! Before I had so many issues with him, and still do but once taking into account the things you brought up... it brings a different dimension to his character!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! God I want to rewatch the drama a third time and that's super rare for me. I never rewatch things unless I really like it!! 

Do you have any drama recs that have as much complexity as Cheese in the Trap???"
KoreanBeauty,fnt8au2,t1_fnsdnz2,1587236547.0,"I think it would definitely work well for your skin! It's one of my favourite creams to date and I plan on repurchasing it. It's very light and absorbs fast and easily but is moisturizing despite it's light texture. It made my skin feel soft and smooth, not too light or heavy for my super dry skin. I think that it could work for a variety of skin types!!! I purchased Cosrx's D-Panthenol cream when I finished it because it was cheaper but I regret not just repurchasing it!"
University,fnt7lsh,t3_g3neus,1587236162.0,"I know it's stressful and feels like your chances are ruined but they aren't! Sure, you may be set back a little but being given a second chance can really help! It won't affect your applications and admission to university as long as you are able to maintain a decent gpa for the redone grade 11 courses and grade 12! If anyone asks about it, tell them how you've overcome issues with your mental illnesses and kept pushing to do your best despite your circumstances!  


You got this! Mental illness is extremely hard to deal with when you're a student but the fact that you value your education and want to pursue post secondary is a great sign and means you are hard working and ambitious despite the issues you have with mental illness! I would highly recommend asking school counselors or even teachers if there are accommodations for people with severe anxiety and depression, they can really help you succeed! I know many people that got help and it realllllly helped them. I had severe testing and social anxiety in high school and unfortunately I didn't seek help because I was too scared and struggled so much with my anxiety... and I really regret not getting the help I needed. Fortunately I did alright and was able to get into university, not my first and most wanted choice but I got into it and I'm finished but I think if I would have gotten help I would have done a lot better and life would have been not as stressful.   


You got this! You haven't ruined your life, you're still young and I think you're going to do well the second time around! You are strong and ambitious and that is the most important. It's very easy for people with mental illness to let it overpower them and give up (no shade to them) but you are continuing on despite your difficulties!"

Before, I was just upset that she was like that to him but it does make sense and it helps with the commentary on how those born outside of Korea or don't look Korean are treated even if they are Korean. 

That's a good point as well, to just show simple decency and care for someone rather than having to be a know-it-all and hurt someone because of disagreeing!"
relationship_advice,fnqpscm,t3_g38h0m,1587169568.0,"Uhm.. You have behaviours that you need to work on. Some are crossing into abusive territory. Being co-dependent, yelling and feeling entitled to your partners attention and time... are forms of abuse. I don't want to make assumptions because of course I don't know you personally or the relationship personally but the fact that you don't recognize the issues with the statements she brought up is alarming.

The highway thing... you scared her. You offering to get out instead doesn't make it better or safer? If she's scared to get out because it's unsafe, it would be unsafe for you to get out as well. She was scared for both of your safety and you were scaring her. I get being upset and getting into an argument but to get so angry to pull over on the side of the highway and scare your partner... it seems like you do not know how to properly handle disagreements and do not understand how scaring someone is not healthy. If you need space during a heated argument to cool down that is fine but wait until you get home where the both of you are safe.

All the times where you get upset about her spending time away from you.. shows that you are being very dependent and not allowing her to have her own life or time for herself, her friends or important things to her. It sounds like you have abandonment issues and that's not your fault BUT you have to realize when you're projecting them onto someone else and expecting them to pacify them for you when it's a you problem, not theirs. Many people struggle with abandonment and loneliness but seeking therapy for it would be very beneficial. It's not healthy to make someone feel guilty for wanting to spend time with their friends and to get suicidal when they want to do that. Or lock yourself in your room. Or get upset about arguing over homework and them staying overnight at their families house. You need to become comfortable with yourself and have things to do to occupy your time so you don't get into those terrible head spaces when she isn't around to keep you company.

Getting upset about her spending time with her sister and her talking to a friend instead of kissing you right away is also very immature. You're acting like she always has to give you her full attention and that isn't healthy. What happens when or if you have kids and she has to care for them? Are you going to get jealous of your own children and make her feel bad? You need to get help for this.

Also getting upset about her family giving her more gifts than you... she's their child... of course they're going to give more gifts to her. It has nothing to do with them not liking you or trying to outcast you. Unless they outright say that to you, don't jump to conclusions. I've been with my partner for almost 3 years and the first christmas together his dad didn't get me anything and his mom got me chocolate and I wasn't upset at all.

Yelling can also be verbally and mentally abusive as well. You don't have to be yelling swears or putting her down to make it abusive. It is okay to be upset and your emotions are valid but learning how to properly manage them and not hurt others is important. When someone is constantly yelled at it can affect their self esteem and make them feel like they're walking on egg shells around you. It makes them not want to talk to you or have serious conversations because they are constantly worried about being yelled at. When you feel upset and feel like you're about to yell take a step back and tell her you need some time and space. Go somewhere else, take some time to cool down then return and let her know what upset you and have a productive conversation about it. Often times, when people yell at you when you are telling them they've done something wrong, it makes them shut down and become defensive. It doesn't help the person understand better, instead it just forces them to get defensive, shut down or not want to even talk to you. Waiting until both of you are cooled down to address issues is better and more productive. Sure, it isn't always easy and sometimes things do get out of hand. BUT recognize when it does and own up to it. Don't blame it on your mental illness. Recognize what you did is hurtful too and make an effort to change.

From this post it seems like you are hyper focused on how people interact with you and have abandonment and co-dependency issues. As well as issues with minimizing and not understanding why your partner is worried. These are not good signs. It's not the end of the world and you can get some help from professionals to work on these but if you don't start realizing how your actions are impairing  the health of your relationship, her freedom and life... it is abuse because you're not recognizing it's negative impacts. You may not be hitting her or saying mean things to her but there are other forms of abuse and they are just as bad. Expecting a partner to always be around and not have their own lives outside of spending time with you is abusive and you are making it like you are fully entitled to her time and attention. Get some therapy, hobbies and friends of your own so you aren't depressed at home when your girlfriend is out studying, hanging out with friends or visiting family. Seriously. Don't use your depression as an excuse, instead recognize the behaviours and actively try to find better coping mechanisms and ways to deal with them.   


I'm honestly surprised your partner has stayed with you this long as if my partner did any of these things... I would have left. Don't take advantage of her patience and kindness. If you truly love her, change your behaviours and recognize how they are not fair and abusive. I wish you luck."
KDRAMA,fnqmp5d,t1_fnqda1y,1587167713.0,"Yeah for sure! I understand why they did it because that is a common issue for a lot of Koreans born outside of Korea but even worse for those mixed and don't look Korean at first glance. It's a common issue many second gen. immigrants feel because they feel at odds in the country they are born and raised because they're an ethnic minority but also experience discrimination and hostility when they visit their motherlands because they have accents or have some western influences on their personalities or ideologies. I know that's a huge issue many people experience and I guess I was expecting more from Yi Seo especially since she's young and I was assuming, more aware of the social issues since she has a lot of experience being in Itaewon. But that's on me LOL.

For sure. Unfortunately I think that happens with every person that grows up in a country other than their motherland and when they visit they get ridiculed for not being as in tune with their motherlands ideas or customs but they also experience feeling like an outsider in their home country because they are a minority :(."
KDRAMA,fnpkwd6,t1_fnpkffq,1587147296.0,"Oh right I forgot he was in that drama too! I didn't watch it but I saw clips of it and it looked interesting. Yeah I don't really enjoy arrogant male leads, it was super bad and just plain annoying in WWWSK lol. I could tolerate it in SWP a bit more."
KDRAMA,fnpjla8,t1_fnomnfv,1587146630.0,"I honestly think if someone doesn't like Itaewon Class they probably won't like What's Wrong with Sec. Kim. I liked Itaewon Class and love PSJ but could not get into WWSK for the life of me. I appreciate his variety in roles but his character in it annoyed the living hell out of me LOL. I think if you want a good PSJ drama, She Was Pretty and Dream High 2 or watch him in The Beauty Inside! Maybe also Kill Me Heal Me, I haven't watched it yet and I know he isn't a main character but I honestly think he has a lot better roles than in WWSK!"

Birds are so fascinating, I can't wait until the weather gets better where I live and we can possibly have some baby birds in our birdhouse. I remember we had some a couple years ago but our birdhouse is pretty deep so we weren't able to really see them well but we could hear them chirping and it was so cute!!!  


I would love someone to do a comedic voice over of this haha. It's so funny watching the babies open their beaks so wide to get food from mom and dad."
relationship_advice,fnlto6w,t1_fnlnahs,1587059538.0,That seems like a great idea but one thing I'd be worried about is how defiant teens are. If his sister thinks a show is cool and makes those comments he might simply not like it or want to watch it because of that. I think the idea is great and maybe she shouldn't make comments to make sure he doesn't get defiant or doesn't like it because women approve of it (incels or people that are close to being one don't take anything that women say seriously and even if something is good or logical they'll disapprove of it simply because a woman likes it or suggests it).
KDRAMA,fnifss5,t1_fni988x,1586979255.0,"You have very good points and it makes me love the show even more tbh. All the characters have depth and of course there are some that you hate like In Ha and Sang Cheul but there's others where you kind of empathize with and although you don't agree with their actions you can see why they are the way they are. Sometimes I even found myself empathizing with Sang Cheul even though he's my least favourite character ever. I think the show does a great job on giving the perception that no one is entirely good or bad and that there's a lot of grey area. None of the characters ate perfect like other characters in dramas where they're kind of put on a pedestal and other characters are demonized and have no relatability or redeeming traits. The show makes you think and question how you perceive characters and your values or morals and whatnot.

And that is a very interesting observation about Jeong too... that people fear their flaws being used against them and people that aren't afraid to do that.  I definitely see that now but I also think it makes you question that too. At least for me, I sit there and think... who does he think he is to take on the role of being the person to use flaws against others and kind of dictate what should happen or how they should be used against people? If he super flawed himself and trying to correct others it comes off as super self righteous and entitled... just reminds me of a less insane Thanos making the decision that he has the right to get rid of half the life on earth. Like in his own mind it's justified and we kind of get why he wants to do it but it's also like... who does he think he is to make that choice??? I'm definitely over analyzing but that's how I've kind of seen it but I definitely agree and see your point too. 

The more I discuss and talk about the drama with others the more complex it seems to get and it's cool!! For all we know the writer might not have even put as much thought about his character as we are ðŸ¤£"
KDRAMA,fni7wls,t3_g1q5qb,1586975483.0,"I feel you. When I watched it the first time I was rooting more for PHJ and didn't realize how manipulative he was but the second time I watched it I was baffled about how toxic he was. I understand that it was due to circumstances and people weren't completely innocent but at the same time... someone that is willing to go to the extents he did to get revenge or get a point across is dangerous imo. And that's why Seol always felt conflicted because she doesn't know if she wants to be with someone willing to hurt others the way he did and whatnot. Both male love interests weren't that great imo. I liked seeing their development though and how they were becoming more self aware but both had a lot of growing and maturing to do LOL. SKJ's character was kinder and less manipulative but he was also a mega jerk at times. PHJ's character was super manipulative and had a lot of unhealthy behaviours but he did grow up a bit and realized how toxic his behaviours was after being with Seol and her not being okay with it and not just sticking to his side and being a yes man like everyone else. I think Seol was a great force in his life because she wasn't like everyone else that just worshipped and put PHJ on a pedestal. She wasn't afraid to tell him when he was being a jerk and doing things that were hurtful and I think he really needed that. He did get better near the end which was great but idk man all the shit he did really leave a bad taste in my mouth and I would be second guessing being with someone like that LOL.

But I agree, she is one of my all time favourite female leads in a drama. She's super relatable and tries her best to make the best out of situations even though she was dealt with a lot of hardships. I feel really bad about her family situation and how poorly they treat her though. She's literally being the best daughter yet because she's a girl they treat her like crap!? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
KDRAMA,fni6y04,t1_fnhsm97,1586975021.0,"Idk man, yeah the characters he wrongs were assholes or jerks but being that petty and spiteful isn't healthy. He was going out of his way to make them hurt more and whatnot. What he did to the chubbier dude, getting him interview at his dads company then completely humiliating him was too much. If someone's willing to do that to someone, I'd be worried what they'd do to their partner if they feel wronged by them or are angry at them."

relationship_advice,fnhz58h,t1_fngmcus,1586971271.0,There's consequences to every action and decision you make in life. Positive and negative. I think you're misunderstanding the actual definition of consequence and assiocating it wth negative consequences immediately. Consequences are just the results or effects of an action... they should definitely think of the results and effects of keeping the baby so they can make plans and prepare? If they don't think of that then they're going in blind? How the fuck is that responsible?
offmychest,fnglrk2,t1_fnghlze,1586936385.0,"Unfortunately, a lot of people who deal with people who invalidate them a good portion of their lives or experience abuse often minimize or invalidate their experiences.

Edit: I also didn't just say that their choice would make things harder for everyone else. I said that it's a big financial responsibility that they have to take on and my parents aren't in the place to financially support another kid and child so they must take that into account too. There's a way to tactfully discuss these things and I'm trying my best to listen to them and be gentle but honest with different things they should consider.

Been helping my mom with rent since I turned 18 and since I help out a lot with expenses and other things they are more than happy to have my help.

I'm thinking about everyone that will be effected and will be involved in the situation. At the end of the day it is her decision and I never said I was going to force or tell her to get an abortion. I'm just not going to sit here and be like ""awesome have a kid without thinking it through!"" then watch as they take advantage of my mom who is already financially struggling. Which will then fall back to me because she'll need help too. I want to make sure they think it through and consider the hardships and financial strain it would put on the family if they do go through with it. Part of being family means you help guide eachother and look out for eachother, not just sit around and watch someone burn and dig themselves a hole and turn your cheek because it has nothing to do with you. They're kids that don't know about all the hardships about providing for themselves or others and think they know everything and think they're maturer than they actually are, they need someone to bring that into awareness and help them think it through."

I wouldn't tell them that I don't agree with it but I do want to emphasize how hard it will be and that they really need to think it through because it is not a decision to be made lightly. I also want them to understand that how hard and straining it would be on my parents if they had to financially support them so they don't think they can just fall back on them and not support themselves. I told them that I will support them and not force anything on them but I do want them to think hard about it and not make a quick decision.

I think you definitely could have handled it better. Asking her to stop and saying that you find it offensive and don't appreciate it... and going to that remark definitely seems a bit immature imo. I think it would have been better to respond like that if you her that you don't like that she comments on it first but she continued to do it anyways. 

I would definitely just tell her that you've been upset by her pointing out your thinning hair and find it disrespect. I think she'll probably be hurt by this for a bit but if you explain to her how it hurt you, it might help her understand a bit better."

relationship_advice,fnfxl17,t1_fnfx4l6,1586917632.0,I am going to bring up everything and how it will impact not just them but the baby and their families. Of course at the end of the day I can't tell her or force her to do anything but I want them to understand the seriousness of it and how they can't expect for my family just to take care of them like they're still children when the baby comes along.
relationship_advice,fnfxebc,t1_fnfwtpc,1586917515.0,"At the end of the day it's her choice but if her choice and her actions are going to affect me, I do have a right to put it out there and not be okay with it. I am hoping to be out by then but it would be a LOT of financial strain my family if we have to look after her and a child."
relationship_advice,fnfx9va,t1_fnfwhp7,1586917439.0,"Of course it is up to them to decide in the end and I'm not going to force them to do anything but they have to realize the impact that it will have not only on them but that child and the rest of their family. They both have no financial responsibility and would need financial support from us, when we're barely even able to support ourselves even when we're not in a pandemic. It will put a LOT of financial strain on my family to say the least."
relationship_advice,fnfx501,t1_fnfw3tz,1586917353.0,So we leave them on the streets with a child? Yeah no one is forcing my family or me to help financially support them but that will ultimately happen because they are immature and have no experience with finances and working whatsoever.
relationship_advice,fnfx1n5,t1_fnfvxwc,1586917295.0,"I know that it is their own decision but at the end of the day it will affect all of us because they will depend on my family to support the child. They can barely afford things by themselves right now and that's why I help out a lot with expenses too. Putting another two people on that plate is going to put us all in a bind not just them. If I knew they could take most of the responsibility I wouldn't care as much but because I know that I will be asked to help financially support them, it affects me."
relationship_advice,fnfww1i,t1_fnfwpad,1586917199.0,"It just seems like they don't understand the weight and responsibility required to have a child and how much work it takes to care for them. If they were working, graduated and have plans I would be less worried but they both have shown to be very immature and don't even take care of themselves that I can't imagine them being able to properly take care of a baby."
relationship_advice,fnfwbsj,t3_g1d4ny,1586916852.0,"I struggled with lack of sensation in my genitals for a couple years, at the beginning of my relationship and it was rough. BUT this may have nothing to do with your size and be a sensation-perception thing. I'm not entirely sure how my lack of sensation happened but I had a suspicion that my anti-depressants caused it as some can cause sexual dysfunction and sensation issues. I would get her to go to the OBGYN and possibly see what it could be. Does she take anti-depressants or any kind of medication?

I know you're struggling with body image and I'm sorry you're going through this but there's a huge chance that it has nothing to do with your size. I felt absolutely nothing when I was struggling with it and still have some loss of sensation almost 3 years after stopping the medication that caused it but it got better over time. I know some people go to physiotherapy and other types of therapy to help with sensation. It can happen at any time and I think she should get some health checks done to make sure there isn't any issues with medication or sensation perception (for some people it's also a sign of MS to lose sensation in some areas).  


Edit: It can also definitely be due to lubrication as well. Sometimes, when I'm too wet I don't feel that much as well. Others have said it in the comments too. Some lubricants also have pain relieving ingredients which can also prevent lack of sensation too. Also, a lot of the times penetration doesn't do a lot for women and clitorial stimulation is the only way they'll orgasm so if you can try to make her orgasm that way it''s okay that she doesn't feel you too. If anything, the act itself is sexy and beautiful, not just the fact you can feel the penis inside. Many women don't feel it but that's okay. Often times it has nothing to do with the mans size, it's just how our bodies are and what works for us. You could also try different positions and even try some anal stuff too. I feel a lot more during anal than vaginal penetration so that's also an option for you."
offmychest,fnf5p0v,t1_fnf1hh9,1586901876.0,"Yikes, good for him for caring about nutrition and exercise but that's extreme. I've heard of people only eating one meal a day and also people doing weeks and month fasting.... just because your body can survive without food for 2 months doesn't mean it's good for you????!!! Doesn't mean you'll thrive..... god I don't understand people like that. Good portion of people can survive cancer but does that mean getting it is ok or good??? Hell no.

And not to mention, bodybuilders exercise and build for a living or at least to win competitions... they get something out of it and often it's their career. Not all take roids but the fact that they make money or have the time to exercise that much is the difference. I mean if I was paid to work out and I had the time to... I would probably workout 5 times a week but ain't nobody got time for that if you have a job unrelated to it lol. And a lot of body builders are unhealthy... the things they have to do to get that big and muscular.... just because they're muscular and work out doesn't mean they're automatically healthy. Many don't take care of their bodies outside of lifting and over exercise (rest is important and over exercise isn't good for you). Having a well balanced and varied diet is very important for health but I know a lot of body builders only eat chicken breast, broccoli and rice... like sure that's better than eating fast food everyday but you're going to be lacking some things if that's all you ever eat. I just shake my head at people like that. It's good to be motivated and care about your health but not when it's extreme and over the top. The sad thing is, people like that think they're healthy so they don't listen when others point out that it isn't sustainable or realistic."
offmychest,fnf0vnq,t1_fnexv4p,1586899368.0,"what the hell, I get people like to do intermittent fasting but that sounds too intense and also stupid for him to push that on you too? Eat whatever works best for your own body. Maybe for him it helps (I don't think it would????? maybe he's telling himself that to make himself feel better about doing it??) but to expect you to do it too is ridiculous. Everyone's bodies are different and require different eating schedules and caloric intake. I know my boyfriend has 3 small-medium meals and snacks throughout the whole day and that's normal for him but for me, I eat three meals a day and don't really snack. I've never been a snacker and my body feels better if I have 3 good size meals throughout the day and don't feel that great having small ones and a bunch of snacks even though people say it's better or prefer it. I'll have a snack here and there maybe like one or two days a week but I can't on a regular basis, it just throws my body out of whack. Same with just eating one big meal a day... I don't understand how some people can do it because my body would go crazy and I'd feel so lethargic and gross only eating within 2-4 hours. That's way too much in a small period of time for me."
offmychest,fnf0d97,t1_fneyla2,1586899112.0,"it could depending on size and your activity throughout the day but if you're active throughout the day and eat at that time and your caloric intake is where it needs to be or even under, you probably won't gain anything. You burn calories while you sleep, not a lot but it's not like you're going to definitely gain weight."
offmychest,fneryyk,t1_fnemk8e,1586894791.0,"The thing is... there is no time when you shouldn't eat depending on your schedule and diet. As long as you're taking in the right amount of food and not eating excessively, it doesn't matter if you eat at 9pm. The only issue is if you eat something that might keep you up longer or prevent you from sleeping. I hate the people that are always like ""don't eat after 6pm/or any certain time"" like you'll automatically gain 50 lbs for doing so. If you aren't eating excessively and have a schedule where you have to eat later... then so be it. You aren't going to gain a bunch of weight."
offmychest,fnerkpx,t3_g16zbh,1586894589.0,"I feel this, the only time where I think it does become a problem is when you have a normal 9 to 5 and you kind of have to be more of a morning person. But if you have a later job or are allowed to have that schedule then people should just leave you be. I hate how our society just forces certain lifestyles on others and forget that we are all different and what is best for each individual is different too! Just because we aren't hyper and ready for that day at 6am doesn't mean we're lazy or less of a mature/responsible person.. we just have different preferences for waking and sleeping. Imagine if the people like us who can stay up until 2am making people who can't stay awake past 10pm feel bad or guilty for not staying awake later? Just because most jobs are 9 to 5 doesn't mean everyone has that schedule or needs to sleep according to that type of life too. If I don't work early, why the fuck should I be forced or guilt tripped into waking up so early? If I start at 4pm and work until 12am, I am not waking up at 6am just to be like others... I'll wake up at a time suitable for myself and my routines."
plants,fnedmr0,t3_g158gd,1586887479.0,HOW? I tried propagating mine and nothing happened. How long did it take before you started seeing growth?
Anxiety,fned2ee,t3_g14yme,1586887193.0,"I'm sorry that happened, it's very scary having to do all of that on your own when you're young and being turned away makes it even harder. I would possibly call another pharmacy and ask if they accept passports as ID's so you can maybe avoid another rejection and not have to go in and deal with it again.  


I hope everything works out in th eend and you're able to get your medication! It's a very stressful time and to have anxiety and not have your medication is even worse."
