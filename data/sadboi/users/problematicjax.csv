TeenAmIUgly,fpqnfha,t3_gevt2v,1588827005.0,you‚Äôre so pretty! i also think your face is very symmetrical? is that a weird compliment? all your features suit each other very well! and i adore your freckles!
SuicideWatch,fposb52,t3_gen4q2,1588789807.0,"hey OP, i hear you. i‚Äôm 18f and my grades have been slipping and weight has been dropping in quarantine as well. i can‚Äôt imagine the repercussions this is going to have on so many peoples‚Äô mental health‚Äî look at the toll it‚Äôs already taking!
i have been in your place many a time. when i was 13 i felt like my life wasn‚Äôt going anywhere and i felt alone. my best advice would be to find the people you effortlessly meld with, who will support you right now and through anything. many health services are also offering free or discounted online/electronic therapy sessions if that is something you‚Äôre comfortable with. i know it has helped me having someone to be completely open with, especially during this time.
if you need a listening ear, feel free to dm me or respond to this. i and so many people (on this subreddit or, i‚Äôm sure, also in your life) are here for you. you are loved."
SuicideWatch,fpor7kl,t3_geofpf,1588789264.0,"do they know about your mental health as it is currently? was this a recent occurrence? if so they may try to take you to see doctors or perhaps to an inpatient program, which honestly are a hit or miss.
it all depends what you want to get out of telling them. do you want them to be concerned, keep an eye on you? do you want their support without too much of a watchful eye? it all depends on the wording. it is a difficult task to let someone in like this, let alone your parents. but i‚Äôm glad you feel open enough with them to be honest about this! i believe in you."
SuicideWatch,fpoqpet,t3_gep3ck,1588789014.0,"i (18f) felt this probably too hard. i‚Äôm a senior which i assume you are, so we‚Äôre both missing out on some really important moments in our lives like prom, graduation, those last moments with our friends or favorite teachers. and it feels like none of the adults really care, or they‚Äôre all brushing it off. am i right? my grades have been slipping as well, and it feels like everyone is focusing on that more than they‚Äôre focusing on the mental health of the students.
fortunately i‚Äôve been lucky enough to be able to attend online/video chat therapy during all of this. once a week i facetime with a professional who i trust. i‚Äôve also learned that many services are offering free or extended sessions with licensed therapists! which can help immensely. it‚Äôs online, as has been everything these days, which has been tough, but not impossible. you have to find something that truly makes you want to improve. art, reading, writing, sitting outside in the sun, playing video games, something that makes you want to be alive every day. organizing helps me. keeping my area clean and donating things to those who need it. trying to assist those in your community who can‚Äôt get their own groceries, stuff like that. perhaps that could help you too.
i know the suicide hotline isn‚Äôt always the best (i‚Äôve called it more than enough times). so if you need a listening ear feel free to chat with me anytime !"
SuicideWatch,fpopt64,t3_g0o0yj,1588788576.0,"my mother, angel on earth, had breast cancer when i was 12. she had a mastectomy and survived. my parents separated and i was diagnosed with depression & suicidal tendencies that same year.
when i was 16 my stepmother was diagnosed with carcinoma, but it was an extremely rare form of the cancer that is one in a million. she died a year later.
throughout these experiences my mental health has depleted. but surprisingly, watching someone die who didn‚Äôt want to/wasn‚Äôt ready gave me a bit of a turn around. i started going to therapy, have found ways of coping and my own ‚Äúscene,‚Äù and group of people who support me. being affected by a parent or parental figure‚Äôs death sort of shows you how much people actually care about the dead, and how distraught they are by it. that‚Äôs what it did to me anyway.
so yeah. it sucks that people who want to die don‚Äôt or sometimes can‚Äôt, and that people who don‚Äôt want to die do. i wish the world was more fair. but the universe has a funny way of giving us lessons when we feel the least receptive."

DreamFuck,fpihw4e,t1_fe7cjr0,1588641243.0,in fact i believe in either her playboy or rollingstone interview she said she would never get work done because she thinks trends change too often. the idea of her having a boob job makes me a little sad too. some people are also saying lip fillers.
raisedbynarcissists,fpicmlt,t1_fphij0y,1588638165.0,"my ND (and one of my grandmothers, his mother) were just the opposite! obsessed with straight teeth & clear skin. took me to the dermatologist every other weekend whenever i had pimples. i still get cystic acne.

i didn‚Äôt want braces‚Äî my teeth were fucked up, but i liked them and thought they were cute. i still look at old pictures and miss how they used to look. my dad would always say ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want you to walk down the aisle on your wedding day with screwed up teeth‚Äù because i never trusted him enough to tell him i don‚Äôt ever plan on getting married or having kids.

my grandmother would say ‚Äúyou will look so pretty WHEN your teeth are straight and white!‚Äù and because of this i‚Äôve always been insecure about my smile, even after the braces came off. nothing will ever be good enough for them."
