I mostly see people eating oatmeal with a bunch of things in it because that's easy to prepare. I understand that you don't want to spend time preparing food, but I'm pretty sure you'd have to prepare your food even if it contains meat. You can buy canned beans, lentils, chickpeas which are already prepared, so you don't have to spend time with that. There are a bunch of easy vegan recipes you can make in 30 minutes, I can even write some if you are interested. I don't usually have time to cook (except now, when I'm stuck at home), so I mostly buy frozen vegetables and canned things that only need heating up and some seasoning. And I cook some rice, or pasta on the side (basically any grains that seems appealing at the moment) which takes like 20 minutes and you can cook 4 days worth of it at once.

Generally speaking, lentils, beans and tofu are cheaper than meat and you can get enough protein from them. For calories, don't try to live on a salad a day, and you'll be fine.
