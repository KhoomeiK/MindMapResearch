news,fqv1xbr,t1_fqun3vh,1589668237.0,"No, cars aren't bad because they can kill people. They weren't designed for killing. Their primary purpose isn't to make killing easier.

Carrying a gun at a protest doesn't make you a protester. It makes you a thug and/or a terrorist. You're carrying it to intimidate other people, and people don't see it as a political statement. You are threatening lawmakers with death if they don't vote your way. Because that's what your gun is designed to do: kill more efficiently.

Using your forearm for self defense is still pulling out a machine designed to make killing easier and firing a projectile at an animal or another person. Plus, there are too many cases where people play fast and loose with the term ""self defense"" to justify cold-blooded murder using legally purchased firearms that were designed to kill something or someone quickly and efficiently.

It's exponentially easier to pull out a gun and pull a trigger than it is to choke someone or stab someone or hit them with a car or beat them to death or shoot them with an arrow or drown them or garotte them or set a bomb. You don't have to get close, you don't have to spend much time planning, you can just grab it, point it, and twitch your finger, without thinking. A 3 year old kid can do it accidentally.

A stupid argument is saying that it's just an inanimate object. It's a weapon. Designed to efficiently kill. You don't even have to have intent to kill. It dishonest to claim it just an innocent little thing just sitting there. I don't trust people carrying them because they might get pissed off and do something they can't take back, no matter what their legal right is.

I don't trust you for your ""political statement"". I don't trust Cletus with the big AR sticker on the back window of his truck that says ""Trust No One"". I don't trust the guy that I work with who thinks there should be absolutely no restrictions on him ownership and always wears his Gadsden Flag hat.

Guns are fucking cool. They can blow shit up and it's great to know how to use one. But guns are dangerous and the very people who go out and do this shit are the people who are least qualified to carry that shit around. When you're so batshit scared of everyone around you that you don't feel safe without arming yourself, you're the one that's going to twitch just a little too hard and make a big fucking mess. And the gun won't care because it's an inanimate object.

So, yeah, blame the people with the guns, not the guns, I agree. So less people should have guns. Because there are way too many people that can't be trusted with these goddamn inanimate objects. Thinking people think guns are to blame is stupid.

Stop arguing semantics while people fucking die."

Due to both our biological and technological abilities to adapt, our species shouldn't go extinct, but we'll be a collection of geographically isolated groups. 

Depending on what kind of technology survives and whether we have surviving individuals that can keep enough stuff running, it's impossible to estimate how long that isolation will last. But if we turn into isolated groups that have no way of interacting for long enough, it's quite possible the species will be affected by enough environmental selective pressure to further speciate. That's thousands of years, though, so maybe not as likely if groups can overcome environmental barriers.

We tend to overcome selective pressures with technological adaptation these days, so that needs to be taken into consideration. I think technology is a part of our evolution anyways, so we may experience no physical changes at all unless we're completely forced back to being feral."
