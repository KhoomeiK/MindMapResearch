depressionregimens,fqow60h,t1_fqouzok,1589526705.0,"Before ritalin I had just dropped out of mba college. And was being treated for severe depression and doing nothing. Ritalin made me pick myself up and enrol for professional finance courses , study for them and pass them, while also learning to trade in the markets and doing part time work. 

I was extremely smart but had always underachieved in my life. People less capable than me were doing much better. I had been able to get a top 15 mba college of my country but that was only because I had been obsessed about it and tired of people taking jibes at me for underachieving. I did alright in my undergraduate but that was just last moment work. I skipped classes and did projects in the last moment. The preparation for the mba exam had given me an all consuming purpose. Once I got in I lost all motivation to wake up in the morning. I couldn't figure out what to do. There was this vaccum where I felt like nothing was worth it. 

I always knew I had depression and adhd. But no one took me seriously or let me meet a doctor. My parents considered it taboo. Finally when I got suicidal I left mba and came back and they saw how I was like really. Sleeping for 14 hours a day and still sleepy. Not doing anything. Constantly ruminating. 

Previous to that episode I had trouble learning due to my adhd. I was never able to keep fixated upon task for much longer. But my depression started around the time I was about 13 . It wasn't as severe as now. But it used to be there and I used to have really bad episodes. Get really low and unable to concentrate or get anything done."

afinil,fqgwwby,t3_giuiac,1589359958.0,"I take Strattera everyday 50 mg and modafinil most days 200mg. I have been for a long time. I have severe adhd and fatigue. I am on ritalin so I usually try to skip moda but on days when my fatigue is overbearing I take moda which is most of the days. To be honest, when I had first taken moda before any medication I had extremely good results. But then I had a gap of almost 4 or 5 years. And then took moda again. And this time moda wasn't as effective. It was good for sleepiness during the day but that's all it did. No focus or any benefits. 

When you say about it, and I think back of the last 2 months it does feel like moda has become less effective with atomoxetine. I can even sleep on moda now. I still take low doses of 100 most days cause it still gives me an anti depressant effect. 

I am not sure if there is any interaction. Since the first and second instances had so much difference in their experience I think with time probably our bodies change such that some meds seem ineffective while others seem to work better. 

Like I started ritalin in 2018 I think. I started with ir and had good results. Then slowly I felt overstimulated on ir so switched to sr but and that seemed okay for a few months less effective but maneagable. Then a few months later I couldn't even feel the sr."

modafinil,fpwg2pb,t1_fpwd73e,1588962826.0,"I am on ritalin for my severe adhd so I got to know what a crash feels like while on it. I will give it a shot. It's like you get a feeling that you were running on some sort of fuel and you ran out of it. Like your car running out of gas. You feel something just went out of you.You might want to do something but do not have the energy for it. Your mind is wandering places. And the most worse part of it is the physical fatigue you feel. Like you might not have done anything physically taxing but it feels like you just did some sort of crazy full body workout for 3 hours or so. You just want to lie on the bed.


And yes. Of tolerance. My first trial of modafinil was about 9 years ago. It was extremely good. I took for something about 10 or 15 days. No tolerance as such. Then i took it next after 5 years or so for my fatigue which is unbearable and the feeling just wasn't the same. Obviously it wasn't tolerance maybe I had changed since 5 years is a long time. 


And since then for about 4 years now I have been on it on and off continuously. On and off as in when my fatigue is bad I take it for prolonged periods of time like 3 or 4 months at a time. Then when I am feeling good I skip it for as many days as I am feeling good and able to carry on. My major goals for taking it are fatigue and depression alleviation. 


Currently I have been taking it for 2 months now I think at 200 mg in the morning when I wake up with no tolerance whatsoever. I didn't mention it since I don't remember it for sure and didn't want to scour the internet right now.But I remember reading about a small study being conducted which concluded that no such indicators can be found which point towards modafinil causing tolerance issues on prolonged usage. That is not to say it is true. But I see this being mentioned a lot that modafinil will build up a tolerance quick like gospel when it all is anecdotal evidence. But I do think you shouldn't take it regularly cause I have had 3 or 4 blood tests in the last 1 year and all the blood tests my liver enzymes had been fucked up and way above range. So I have started some natural liver support supplements with it. 


I tried melatonin did not seem to have much effect on me to be honest. Coffee does make me a bit jittery as well when taken with moda.but usually goes away. I am usually skeptical of natural supplements a lot since I kept hearing so much about them and ended up trying a bunch of them but never felt a tiny bit of difference from them."
modafinil,fpvvd6m,t3_gfu6ip,1588952511.0,"Few things  


* Modafinil could also cause a crash. it does for me. i guess all stimulants do. it is usually better than other stimulants but it is there. no studies about it i believe. should be prepared for it. And that's why it is better to start off with a low dose because high doses tend to cause crashes. keep tapering upwards till you find a dose which suits you.
* modafinil does cause insomnia but the effect of it on sleep after you have slept hasn't been studied i believe and from what my experience has been and i have read many people's reviews this is a very small number i believe who might have this problem. 
* the point about tolerance is also anecdotal. There seem to be equal number of people not having tolerance as the ones who seem to have tolerance. Don't think this has been studied either. But the first time you take it is obviously going to be great and no matter how many days gap you take in between you will never have same effects. This applies to all drugs i believe. taking gaps is in general better for overall health since moda is harsh on the liver.
* different types of afinils have different types of results. and some people are do not react to afinils at all.
* finally not to have exceptional expectations from it. You wouldn't become Bradley cooper from limitless with it. it's focus effects tend to be marginal and it works more on the motivational aspect. people looking for a magical pill, this isn't it. if you have super high expectations they will never meet them."

BipolarReddit,fphngn1,t1_fpgz7ee,1588624378.0,"I have been on ritalin for almost 2 years now I think. 
I have a different kind of problem. Ritalin is making me numb. Which is not bad in a way if you see since I had been in a depressive episode sometimes getting suicidal for about 4 years in one phase(not counting my long term depression and suicidal tendencies since childhood) and ritalin changed a lot for me. It brought me out of that phase and I haven't had a suicidal thought ever since starting it and I actually do work instead of lying on bed the whole day or procastinating.

But it has stopped my inner thought process which was probably the reason of my crippling anxiety. But made it harder to make decisions as well. Since I can't feel out my options. 

And most importantly I do not have the feeling to socialize. Leading to not talking to friends or hitting on girls or any sort of social interaction whatsoever. I just don't like talking to people anymore cause I don't seem to feel anything from it. My crippling adhd is such I cannot quit it either I think without being unproductive.

And all form of amphetamine salts are banned in my country. Also tried non stimulants didn't make much of a difference. Guess I am fucked."

 I spent about 1000$ in 2017 on a hp laptop and have sworn never to use hp ever again. 
Right off the bat had driver issues. Fixed it myself since they weren't responsive. 
Battery from the start was 2 hours max with low brightness, and normal performance just for browsing and mba work. 
Laptop always got hung up all the time. Kept freezing on me. Screen flickered. At one point, screen went blank. Keyboard malfunction. 
At one point the entire screen gave way. Had to replace the screen. During that time saw the battery had ballooned. Replaced that as well. With my money btw. Cost me around 150$. 
New battery life was 3 hours. 
Opened it myself and changed the HDD to an SSD so it became a bit better. Now shows ram issues. Trackpad is unresponsive. Some latency as well. 
Connected it to a monitor and using as a pc. Trying to squeeze as much value out of it as I can.

Hate to break it to you, but Modafinil doesn't give the same focus effects. My doctor tried to get me off one.

If you have never medication before for adhd then any afinil will definitely feel like an improvement however if you have been a long time stimulant user then I don't think you will be satisfied with the focus effects.  
You could probably add in a non stimulant to your afinil, like atomoxetine or something so that might be an improvement as well.

askdrugs,fngkd06,t3_g1j8sa,1586935019.0,"I have adhd, bpd and delusional OCD. I think it depends on how severe your adhd is. While everyone is talking about the withdrawal, no one is considering what your base adhd was like. Mine was fucking nuts. I couldn't think straight for 5 mins. Couldn't study or do tasks and always kept procastinating. My emotions were haywire as well.

 While I wasn't on adderall I was on ritalin, and few times I have decided to quit because I felt the meds aren't doing much. 

The withdrawals from ritalin aren't that bad. Just tiredness and sleepiness for a few days.
But when I got back to my normal state I realised how much of a difference the meds were making in my life. I could talk better , not put off things and do my fucking tasks, Kept my place clean, was organised and had actually achieved some tasks not without even dead lines. It was like without meds I was only 30% of what I should have been. And I realised, with my adhd level, I am in this for life. 

So I know the withdrawal might be one of the biggest worries. But I think another big factor would be that whether you can manage life with adhd."

Pharma is going up cause that's where the vaccine is going to come from. And once it does, it would be a huge profit irrespective whether the government pays or people pay. In the meantime sale of medicines due to lockdown would have increased as well as the fact that the sale of gloves and masks would be at an all time high.  
And as to why the hospital aren't going up, the expenses of the hospitals have shot up. It would cost a lot more to maintain isolation wards than normal wards not to mention they are having to pay more than the normal salary to the medical people on duty.

Lastly from experience, you should get a monitor. It makes a huge difference. The smoothness of a monitor screen is just not present on a laptop screen. Maybe if you go to the higher end laptops the screens would be better but still monitors provide a larger screen as well.

Even I am looking for something to add so that I can reduce my dosage of stimulants while also improving my overall executive functioning and currently debating between buproprion and atomoxetine. 

I have taken both for some time in the past. Buproprion gave me a lot of organisational skills. Like I felt compelled to organise things and plan out everything months in advance . Using a ton of productivity tools and also helped my motivation. But I did not notice any apparent improvement in my thinking capacity. 

The problem with my atomoxetine trial was that I was prescribed a very low dose. 50mg and I weigh 80kgs at 5 ft 10 inches. As per my findings my dose should have been close to 100mg. But I did notice some benefits. My need of ritalin reduced. my thinking improved. My mood evened out and the mocks I was giving for some exams made quite a bit of jump.

Sectional tests. See our adhd brains are hardwired for instant gratification. If the results are long term we tend to not be able to stick or want to study.
