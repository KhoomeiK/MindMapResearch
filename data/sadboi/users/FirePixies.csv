BPD,fg7vceo,t3_exetwi,1580602387.0,"Boundaries are extremely important for us. We have a hard time with them, especially if they trigger our abandonment issues. Depending on your friend's level of awareness of their illness, the setting of boundaries could go over well or could make them feel worse for a while. But, like the other comment said, reassuring them that you will be there and you love them is paramount.

If it was with me, and if my fp could hold this space for me, I would ask them to set a time when we could talk for a few minutes. Then the rest of the day I knew I shouldn't message or call so that my fp could do their thing, and I could focus on myself (or try to).

There's lots of different strategies you could try. But the most important thing is to reassure them you're not going anywhere even if you do need a little space."
