Your heart might then compensate by speeding up your heart rate to try and keep blood flow the same. Could be you are sensitive to it (you could maybe use less) or are possibly using it over too large an area so you are absorbing enough to cause those symptoms. If you are already using a small amount then you could try washing it off after a few hours or incrementally less and see if it helps since it keeps getting absorbed for quite some time on the surface of the skin even after drying. 

The dizziness could also be from the diet and exercise as your blood sugar could be getting lower than your body is used to so you could also just see how you feel once you’ve kept the new lifestyle for a while."

Those researchers would travel all over to find bats which may not have had any other venue for interacting and infecting humans. They also might have found one that wasn’t able to transmit to humans when they discovered it, but while infecting more convenient lab animals as reservoirs for research it may have naturally mutated in those mammals to be transmissible to humans. All it takes is one little mistake by lab personnel to have a virus like that get out and they have had those mistakes occur in the past when the labs were supposed to have procedures in place so that wouldn’t occur. 

Also, even if it wasn’t from the lab the type of market from which it more likely originated has been cited as a likely place for future coronaviruses like this to arise for years and is even mentioned in some mainstream study materials for medical students. There could have been changes made to make these markets more hygienic or they could have enforced the bans they have had on those markets at different times.

The Chinese also arrested the doctors who warned about the virus at the outset, misled the WHO for weeks, and did a few other things which are mentioned in the link above which definitely would place the blame on China for their role in the early spread of the virus. 

I wouldn’t trust a government who routinely hides their faults and silences anyone who mentions them only to save face.

Although, the US government under Trump is following suit with those habits, which makes sense since Trump has complimented Xi for his tactics before, and we deserve just as much criticism for our handling of the pandemic as China. 

The stance people seem to be taking in media is that it’s either all our fault or all China’s fault which is absurd. Both countries have varying amounts of fault and it’s outright political whataboutism to not consider the faults of everyone involved appropriately."

unpopularopinion,fp8wkvm,t1_fp8t7gi,1588405511.0,"Depends on how you define rape. I’ve been raped both by non-legal rape definitions which should be considered rape (coerced, forced to penetrate, and blackmailed with two instances involving threats with a knife) and what is considered rape via penetration by a woman. The below is part of a lengthy discussion about the statistics behind rape and how big a difference it makes when you use a non-inclusive definition which was presented to me once. I found it fairly comforting knowing that I’m not the only one in my situation. Although it sucks that other people have had to go through similar experiences as myself without being taken seriously.



“Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the ""rape"" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for ""made to penetrate"" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, and 2015 NISVS studies.

As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm

an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey

and

The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.

vs

an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey

and

Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),

So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of ""made to penetrators"" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.

But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.

And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been pretty close between the sexes every year.

2015 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf

2010 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf

Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known

data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were “made to penetrate” someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.

And non CDC study...

A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.

The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/

Another non CDC study...

a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.

And another non CDC study...

National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,’ 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”

Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers

when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).”"

I’ve also been sexually harassed by women before and it really doesn’t compare to attempted murder.

At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission. The Chinese authorities continue their work of intensive surveillance and follow up measures, as well as further epidemiological investigations.”

Two of my cousins were in similar situations and then just never left their family home’s and have become completely dependent on their family despite now having degrees and will likely stay home until their parents die. Its already been 10 years for one and 7 for the other since graduating high school. Leaving home can be very good for a child’s future because nothing can replace that feeling of independence and knowing you can get by on your own.

On the other hand, you can take a more moderate approach and enact rules that will foster independent development. For example, you can start off with charging rent even if its a minor amount so that he can start building his financial skills in terms of budgeting and responsibility. Maybe ask that he cooks one meal a day, every other day, or just weekends for the family so he will be able to cook for himself when he does leave home. Some people don’t know how to do chores for themselves, if thats him you should require he does at least some on weekends. The only thing I would suggest is that you don’t overburden him time-wise because the workload of college or a full-time job can be hard to adjust to, but he will definitely need to learn how to time manage daily life requirements and work."

For example, SARS-Cov which also came from an animal reservoir, most likely bats. Its also normal to compare similar viruses to each other because they act similarly most of the time because they have similar bodies just like people may look a little different, but generally have the same anatomy except for a few outliers which this one doesn’t seem to be based on the training I’ve had to take to work with COVID-19 (SARS-cov-2)patients. This one just causes particularly bad symptoms/damage in addition to its high infectivity and was unable to be stopped in the east like the previous outbreak. There’s a reason more eastern countries were more dramatic handling this pandemic and its because SARS was a relatively bad virus too and the experience dealing with that allowed them to better understand how to handle these kinds of outbreaks. Also, corona viruses are one cause of the common cold so most people have already been infected with “similar” viruses so its not a completely new introduction into any population at this point."
China_Flu,fnv64i2,t1_fnv3ubx,1587281554.0,The flu is special in that it has mechanisms to significantly alter its genome which changes its antigens through antigenic shifts while many viruses undergo just antigenic drift which is much slower and mild allowing immunity to last several years as is the case with most other coronaviruses.
China_Flu,fnv4xp9,t1_fnv3qy5,1587280382.0,There are actually 8 major strains already. They only differ by 11 base pairs at most. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/5080571002 Thats an incredibly small portion of just their RNA which makes an even smaller impact on the phenotypic features which the body uses to identify the virus. If the virus mutated so rapidly that all of the major strains could not be identified by the same immune response then one single vaccine would be completely useless since all it does is stimulate an immune response to the virus it is targeted towards. If multiple viruses are targeted by the vaccine that would further delay its development as well. The flu viruses have very specific methods of increasing the variability of their viral genome while coronaviruses have specific machinery to do the opposite.
China_Flu,fnv3kp5,t1_fnv1nho,1587279083.0,"Just putting this out there, I am sorry if you have felt attacked by the responses you have received from myself or others in this thread. I’m just in the medical field training to become a physician so I was trying to share my insight with you. 

Here’s something for thought, would you rather we are overly cautious and overly diagnose COVID-19 thereby quarantining the most positive cases possible, but it LOOKS bad or would you rather we are sparingly diagnosing COVID-19 and missing a few positive cases which do not quarantine and then spread the disease and the disease/pandemic actually IS bad. Most doctors would choose the cautious route for public health concerns. You are right though, that is exactly why pneumonia by other causes has nosedived.  




You can skip this last part if you want since it is extra info. Tests function by similar standards: you have to decide at what point will the test be positive or negative when designing it and that is the primary source of false positives (being cautious, test is positive with a minor amount of virus that may have accidentally been in the sample for example) and false negatives (being overly scrutinizing, the test might only be positive if there is a lot of the virus present in the sample that could only occur from someone who has a raging infection at the time of the test, but might miss someone already recovering)."
China_Flu,fnv1c27,t1_fnv08z7,1587277063.0,"You really seem to like extremes. Why does it have to be all test and no professional judgement or no test and all professional judgement? 

This was a case where the test was misused, not that it doesn’t work at all. On a side note, negative tests actually are “ignored” all the time in lieu of further testing if there is appropriate justification for it. We just don’t have many options for testing at this point in time."
China_Flu,fnv019h,t1_fnuz91s,1587275924.0,"Its not some random people calling “everything” COVID-19. These are people who went to school for a heck of a long time and then spent several more years receiving additional training. If she self-diagnosed as someone who is completely untrained in medicine then that would be inciting panic, but that isn’t what happened. Testing is simply a tool that physicians use to aid in diagnosis and just like any other tool it can be faulty or used incorrectly. In this case, it was judged that the tool was likely used incorrectly due to testing too late. Without a trained professional using a tool you can’t trust the tool in a layman’s hands. Give that girl an antibody test specifically used for testing for COVID-19 and guess what, it will probably come up negative even if she had it and the initial test for the viral RNA was positive. Even if its the right test for the disease it can be used inappropriately."

Therefore, it is her responsibility to act as a presumptive positive patient. She didn’t just make up her diagnosis. There are different tests for different periods of time during infection and whoever was in charge of her care evaluated her clinical signs and timeline eventually identifying the possible error in testing (could have been a false negative or simply bad timing). I would trust the medical team’s judgement over police or a school that have no medical training."
China_Flu,fnuvu2i,t1_fntn4ww,1587272456.0,"You don’t need medicine or a vaccine to gain immunity to a virus so long as you have a competent immune system and you live through the infection. Medicine helps alleviate symptoms and vaccines can often avoid symptoms altogether, but they certainly aren’t required. 

In fact, the likelihood is that herd immunity will effectively reduce the impact of the virus well before a vaccine is readily available to any country due to a majority of immunocompetent people living through the infection and how long vaccine development is (unless steps are skipped). This virus type is also known for its general stability so large/numerous mutations that primed immune systems won’t recognize aren’t likely either. That being the case, vaccines will mostly be effective for people who never got the infection due to isolation and/or herd immunity as well as those whose immunity has dwindled after a few years (varies by specific virus and host immune system)."

unpopularopinion,fnrq6iv,t1_fnrme0a,1587197450.0,"It can happen over all sorts of mundane or serious feelings. I’ve been in several relationships (one way worse than the others) where trying to be open about my feelings just led to getting blamed for feeling depressed, frustrated, or suicidal to the point that I just learned to shut up about it to avoid fights. So if I end up a part of the statistic (likely with my history) while dating a gal someday, she’ll probably be blindsided.

Usually it would be accusatory like its my fault so they can’t be blamed for it. Even if they had nothing to do with the described reason for the feelings. For example, me saying I am depressed or stressed out by school and family issues (sick, dying, cancer) would lead to “Well its not my fault you are depressed! Just drop out of school (essentially give up my career) and don’t talk or visit your family anymore and you’ll be fine”.

Sometimes, it would get turned around to where me describing my feelings hurt an ex’s feelings so I had to apologize for making her feel bad or get yelled at for not apologizing. Same example as above, “You are making me feel like its my fault you are depressed because you aren’t supposed to be depressed while we are dating. You are supposed to be happy anytime we are together! *starts crying* I can’t believe you are making me feel this way, don’t you feel bad at all?”. 

Both responses are simplified real-life responses I’ve received (examples were real) and now I just find a therapist to talk to since I have no faith in sharing my feelings with an SO anymore."

Plus, its so much worse when thieves steal from the poor because they already have so little it can heavily impact their lives.

Did he deserve getting his feelings hurt, probably, but I can see why he would want her to apologize.

Although in this case John didn’t relate to other guys named John because his nickname is J (he doesn’t associate himself with being a burden and sick because he is working supporting the family rather than the people he might be thinking about in nursing homes). 

Regardless of all that, his interpretation was likely along those lines based on his state of mind at the time. If you’ve never cared for the elderly you probably wouldn’t understand how much of their lives and thoughts revolve around burden and sickness. Her intent may not have been to hurt his feelings, but when your own family tells you that you are a burden it is so much more personal than if someone else had made the same point."

Personally, I think he was an asshole for saying old people are going to die, but calling someone a burden and saying they are going to die is  generally disrespectful and she should have apologized instead of crying. On that note, it was a complete overreaction to slap her too. Older people are more sensitive about being burdens and dying so its understandable that he would get emotional though."

Usually though it was completely incidental and I just happened to zone out in a gal’s direction while thinking random stuff.

Nowadays, its either incidental or I am appreciating a particular facet of a woman’s beauty like her hair, smile, or butt in passing. Much like I would take a moment to appreciate a particularly beautiful sunset, a broad blue sky, or a flower in bloom (so many pics on my phone of these). I have a fairly stubborn case of ADHD so just about anything beautiful/interesting within my field of vision can decide to occupy my brain’s attention for who knows how long.
