Turn your server 2003 systems into terminal servers, and have all the works RDP into the one system. This way, you don't have to sync local accounts or anything! Don't even bother with a new server, just use that as a chair! As I'm sure there's not a lot of those either! And best part, all the client PCs can stay on XP, because they can just use the server to browse the web!

For the email, again simple! Just have it automatically forward all email to an onsite non-microsoft server, like hmail! Then give them all straight access to a shared account on there and let them sift through their own email. No more IT problems of ""why is this persons account not working""!!! 

Oh yeah, make sure to have RDP open through the firewall at the default port without account lockouts or complex passwords enabled. That way, it'll reduce user connection issues!!!"
