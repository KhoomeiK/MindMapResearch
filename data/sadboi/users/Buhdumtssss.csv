Tough fucking tiddies pal. Real Estate and the stock market are supposed to be speculative. Otherwise that's the definition of welfare for the upper class.

Also, those commerical rent agreements you have with small businesses, according to contract law I'd bet most of them are void, due to the government forcibly preventing an avenue to make money with said property which is implicit in the agreement. The so called ""act of God"" clause

If you're 30 years old and still taking wishy washy answers from potential mates that's probably the reason you're here bud.

I don't actually take the advice from this forum because 90% is useless or directly counterproductive. Like someone's idea of how relationships should go not how they actually are
