On a side note, what do you mean by changed the meat? Super curious"
wendys,fg2t625,t1_fft04d8,1580454833.0,"Actually fun fact, in the mornings for breakfast it's only supposed to be two people who basically will only do prep for breakfast and not lunch, and then have more workers come in when usual openers would and they set up the store for lunch. 
I'm not trying to be rude towards you, more so to get a load off about how shitty it's going to be when we start serving breakfast, if that makes sense."

wendys,ff7pj97,t3_ernx6g,1579655215.0,"If we're being real here it's because it's cheaper in the company. Coming from a current Wendy's worker. It's cheaper to buy, doesn't go 'bad' as fast, and takes less time to prep which means less billable hours for the workers, overall it's just a strategic move for the big boys at corporate."

AskReddit,erhmrl5,t3_c1qys4,1560878405.0,Lava is not even as hot as the stovetop flame. I think it then feel the need to tell everyone this crazy thing it blows my mind. Think about it heat (in objects) is distinguished by color with blue and white being hotter than red and orange. The stovetop flame is mostly blue/white lava is just red and orange. Its not even as hot as the bottom of a candle flame. Blowing my own mind again typing it out.
