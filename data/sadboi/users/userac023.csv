depression,fr6cvqt,t3_gmxkqy,1589923975.0,"also for the echolalia thing, it's usually a rare thing if it does happen ( i probably only was like this a few times my whole life, and usually was when i had gone through a long stressful day and was then put into a situation that just pulled the last straw and then caused me to communicate the way i would ). 

other times could happen in a more less severe way, which is where the interpersonal situation or w.e then causes me to be more limited in the way i respond and i'll do it to mock another person to get them to shut up and understand things better..., although unfortunately, it's sad that people can't change, despite me literally shoving what they are doing to others, back at their face. 

this is one issue with my dad is his whole sarcastic tone and commenting, and that was the point of me mimicking my dad as a signal to him to not respond that way. and even though i have let him know in a more ""normal"" communication manner afterwards and / or let my mom know about this so she can tell him about his behaviors, it still doesn't change that behavior of his or other typical people i come across."
personalitydisorders,fpuqhf5,t1_fpjgd4m,1588920347.0,"I agree, the pathetic part is that those commorbities are possible because of the shitty DSM 5, because the DSM 5 indirectly favors a perspective that human behavior should be complex, and therefore ANYTHING is possible when it comes down to commorbidity. the DSM 5 could have improved from previous knowledge of earlier psychological research but instead, carried on a more ""broad but it works"" path.

Here's a interesting story of mine, before i got first diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder and major depression ( depression was always there ), i used to think i had borderline personality disorder, and at this time, i never even came across or heard about schizotypal personality disorder, fast forward several years later, now i don't wan't to associate myself with anyone who has borderline PD, as i got the ""real"" insight of what type of people they are ( i don't like them or relate to them ), but then again, i don't really relate to other schizotypal people either, and even for the things i ""Relate"" to more, aren't even part of the DSM or as real diagnosis, but rather subtypes, and even then, the information about them are conflicting, with different viewpoints and points of emphasis, which would make it problematic in DSM's approach, with the assumption that there would need to be adequate distinction in the study for creation of a new disorder, and as i just stated, for the conditions i relate to, there may be too much of a gap between the nature of the condition alone, and therefore would make it unfeasible to create a distinct label for it.

this would be for the following below:

\-vulnerable narcissism

\-sluggish cognitive tempo

\-covert schizoid profile ( the schizoid forum members in psychforums like to think that the covert schizoid profile of salman akhtar matches people with avoidant personality disorder in denial, it's ironic they say this when these traits are no where mentioned almost anywhere, yet they assume it's part of something easily discernible as avoidant people ), and to come to figure, that they wan't to be removing schizoid personality disorder from the DSM is not suprising..., because they should, now where these covert or overt schizoid profiles go to, we'll that's the question isn't it?

\-schizoaffective disorder depressive subtype without having any delusions of reference or hallucinations, but having a form of psychosis that excludes the two i just mentioned, and is a combination of internal and external problems ( biological, physiological, interpersonal, social, etc ), which then causes the brain to become out of control and haywire on and off, such which then may show up as rage that gradually comes out, depending on circumstance and / or extended to violent outbursts. other symptoms would or can include catatonia and / or tics, echolalia, etc, depression that is NOT episodic, and the rest of the symptoms are basically negative or ""Depression"" related.

\-there may be more, but this is the best my brain can do for 30-45 minutes of trying to gather information and write properly."

SCT,flyiy5q,t3_frbmf3,1585603021.0,"stupid or not, it requires a lot of capacity and ability to achieve a 3.5 throughout high school and particularly into college. i know this is your experience and you say that SCT is something you relate to, however, i believe what you have / have had up to this point wasn't SCT, but rather ADHD-PI ( not SCT ), but a subtype of ADHD.

I know that what i'm saying could be looked at as an opinion, but then again SCT isn't an actual established condition, and even if it was, like ADHD, it doesn't necessarily make it any more valid to create more specific objective conclusions, unless there is some kind of evidence that explains proper reasoning to it, and at this point, SCT is still very subjective and may even remain so.

Reddit communities and online communities in general tend to share more in common, aside from myself which i differ mainly from them...., what i can tell you is from my opinion, SCT is incorrectly given to those who's problems do not really qualitatively resemble the true nature of the disorder. what i mean by this is that extensive research on it would show you that the problem that SCT people have is more of a combination of personality and cognitive ability.

the SCT people for example scored somewhat on the lower average IQ range in Barkley's research, which I myself also do, and what i'm getting at is that these SCT people are not really the same type of people you see here on Reddit. I am in no way saying that you, they or I are dumb or stupid, quite ironically, i'm saying that you're superior, but you've previously created an inaccurate observation of yourself from sheer opinions other people had on you.

what i got from you is quantitative problems, not qualitative. sort of like those with certain ""learning disorders"" who CAN solve an issue properly but just need more time, etc, and the way you explained it resembles that. I do not see this with those who truly have SCT. I know that posts alone may not create a better understanding on what SCT really may be, but i hope that someone can take notes on all this and expand it, though, a bit unlikely in my department."
isfj,flye04y,t3_fqj0uj,1585600387.0,"as an ISFJ, i actually envy / don't relate to most of other ISFJs, in fact, i haven't met in particular who was mostly like me, they were different enough where i didn't wan't to associate myself with them, and of course, most of other types i rarely get along with and even if i do, it's not really getting along with them as so much as not having a rough time with them, and so even if the getting along part may not be as much of a nuisance, the envy part still remains. for example, they might be polite and nice to me, but i'll still hate them and envy them, especially if there is any flattering of any kind.

i find it ironic but at the same time not surprising ( for me ) that you would get along with ENFPs so well, despite being the type ISFJs would least likely to get along with. do you mind me asking what you're enneagram type is if you know? reason being is because i feel like the whole ISFJs blindly caring for others and getting along is usually if they are enneagram 2s or 9s, but LESS likely if they are enneagram 6s which i am.

the reason why i said less likely with enneagram 6, and this goes with sort of the first and second paragraph is that i haven't found much of a difference between the 6 types i've seen online or in person, considering they would be more common anyways so variation should be likely to be higher ( logically speaking ). but i come from long experiences and so i'm referring to experiences particularly in specific areas and encounters, obviously not ALL enneagram 6s, i'm simply saying in the relevant areas to which i would put myself in, i wasn't able to connect and feel comfortable with the others which included in areas of mental health communities to which you'd think enneagram 6 ISFJs would likely to pop up ( here and there ). i would happy to discuss this in more detail if anyone is interested.

this is what makes it more ironic is because once you take away all these superficial fluffy traits of the ISFJ, then other types are likely to put you in the category of being ""unhealthy"", because you aren't stereotypically providing any of these positive assets for people, and so now they can't look at you as a person on a ""neutral"", ""reasonable"" or non stereotypical level. this is exactly the experience i've had with most people overall, regardless of whether you wan't to factor in MBTI. I've never seen any positive descriptor of ISFJs that wasn't different from the norm or usual positive descriptors of ISFJs. 

It always entails some kind of selflessness concept, rather than just giving a positive description outside it. although there is one that i do agree with which is putting effort. however, even here, it's always along the lines of because they help people so much, they end up burning out or w.e, like it doesn't say something like, because they put so much effort in general to do just exist and function in life, they end up developing mental illness and depression, not because they are blindly helping people, but because they have to deal with people who are more blessed than them and have to deal with their bullshit while trying to find a niche of their own."
isfj,flkwf4a,t1_flcykuk,1585248949.0,where exactly can i find this ISFJ chatroom place?
JordanPeterson,fjzq3q5,t1_fjzm676,1583726027.0,"i was gonna add this sort of information in the original post, but i was concerned that people were gonna criticize me of writing too much or getting lost into my perspectives, though i do write a lot usually anyways, but i guess for this post, i was waiting to give these other types of details later on such as now, as to not make it too excessive for the first portion.  

i will be writing excessively here about random but interrelated stuff,  i'm hoping someone can follow through, so yeh, like you mentioned, conscientiousness and neuroticism are factors. i have taken the big 5 test, and i come out as having very high neuroticism, high conscientiousness, slightly high on agreeableness, very low on extroversion, and extremely low on openness to experience ( scoring zero or almost zero usually ).

however, i detest the idea that conscientiousness is helpful or even protective against things like depression, and although i understand the reasoning in it and what has been interpreted of it, i still don't agree with it, because it's saying that if compared to someone who is less conscientious for example, then automatically you should be in better health and functioning because the conscientiousness would compensate or w.e, which simply is not true, and if anything, this compensating would actually be a indicator that you're more inferior. clearly there are many people who have low conscientiousness who function well, can hold a job well, have good interpersonal functioning, do not have problems with managing money, etc. 

you know, being conscientiousness, requires we'll...being conscientious, it's not like i magically can be conscientious, it requires a lot of effort and if i'm become apathetic enough, then i can become ""psychotic"" from not being ""conscientious"" enough or out of control, especially in interpersonal situations where i need to be attentive enough or self regulate myself. i think it's worth mentioning, that i have schizotypal personality disorder and major depression, so it's unclear what is explaining what.   

and i do have criticisms on the big 5, much like other things, they are flawed in many ways. for example, with neuroticism, it's not really a realistic way to measure how well someone's health is and quality of life is ( due to the subjectivity of it ), and of course, the other traits matter to make a conclusion as a whole about the individual, but i just wanted to point out that obviously if one element of a larger thing is too subjective or flawed, then it's not gonna be logical to make a conclusion about a larger thing. 

for example, i would go as far to say that the studies that have been done up to this point on big 5 in relation to the personality disorders are flawed and simply wrong / inaccurate, and the reasons are quite simple, their are incorrectly observing certain traits of people as being disordered or impairing when in reality, they aren't, and usually are just traits. another example is research saying those with OCPD aren't really affected from having a lower quality of life, yet if you look closely on what exactly the problems that are found in OCPD, you're realize, that doesn't make logical sense, if anything, their quality of life would be pretty poor, but i guess it's a unique commorbidity of me relating to OCPD, that when you have this type of commorbidity, there is more qualitative impairement, but if you only have OCPD, then the impairement in overall quality of life is not that high. 

it's sort of like where having the condition sluggish cognitive tempo + ADHD has more types of impairements than if you were to just have one disorder or the other. clearly, if SCT was just ADD or ADHD inattentive type ( aka ADHD-PI ), then you wouldn't be seeing these types of impairements, because if it's not a genetic link, then the only other reasonable explanations would be related to personality / environment / upbringing. ( i personally see SCT as a symptom of a more complex issue, personality, genetics and environment all at the same time ). Similar to Personality disorders in that it's a stable trait that shows up in early adolescence and somehow morphs into other sub presentations and ways of being that change, based off development, etc."
JordanPeterson,fj8q9bg,t1_fj8kegc,1583119472.0,"also i want to mention that is it's extremely stressful and difficult for me to write and communicate things online, especially when i'm responding like i have here, and i can spend sometimes as much as an hour or more ( factoring in what i say, because like mentioned previously, i don't want people to get the wrong idea or create misunderstanding ), and it simply just takes me that long to communicate, and it can really hamper my overall health when i have to put all this effort, and i develop a lot of brain inflammation.

in person, like i said, it can depend, but generally, it's distressing and i don't do that well in groups. one on one with someone who i'm comfortable and whom can work with me like my psychologist, and it's pretty good and can be therapeutic, but other situations, it's usually just stressful and just finding a way to barely get by and do my part, while still being aware of my self and not going into any boundary that is too farfetched, etc."
JordanPeterson,fj8oegj,t1_fj8kegc,1583118160.0,"i made an error in the part you quoted ( this is why i'm very careful when i write, and i suppose this is more or less a similar hardship for ISFJs in general), because people often misinterpret what i mean due to some grammatical mistakes, etc, that i made, and i end up being accused of all sorts of negative things by others, and as a result, misunderstanding happens. 

what i meant to say is that there are certain things i've thought about and concern me, and often, i almost always need to just say all of them entirely, because for one, it just comes to me on random periods, and so i'l forget and won't be able to give the full details later on, and so if i could just get it all out when it's in my conscious, then i can feel relieved and don't need to worry about having to go back and forth with something.

and this is for good reason, specifically from what i remember in any past experience when i'd write less or not as like you mentioned as excessive, this might have helped some people or w.e, but on my part, it didn't, because i'd respond and give details but it wouldn't reflect what i actually felt or thought about something in the exact way to which i felt about it or makes sense. 

basically what ends up happening is it turns out like a conversation in person in real life where i usually can't reason with the other person, and often i end up being taken advantage of in the argument or conversation, that makes it seem like the other person is more right or logical, and this causes a lot of frustration, especially when the topic moves away from what i really was trying to get at. 

It's just the way i am, and like i said, i'm not sure if you read entirely what i wrote, the other situation involves me not saying much, but still an issue arises, but for a different causes and matter. it doesn't mean i'm not in the middle, i do and am, and can reason and talk well with certain people such as my psychologist or maybe some random stranger who doesn't necessarily have to be mentally ill or w.e, but unfortunately in most online communities, the different styles of thinking / communication and like you said, the whole ""instant gratification"" element that others have may be to blame for not being able to connect with them."
personalitydisorders,fj8mo9p,t3_f80vpb,1583116973.0,"i personally don't think borderline personality disorder is a true ""personality disorder"", specifically from my experience seeing them both in person and online, but also considering how they benefit so well to treatments that non PD patients do well in, the borderline patient benefits and improves more or less the same way, and there is just something about them, i can't really point a finger on it, but makes them resemble ""normal"" or ""typical"" people ( non personality disorder ) people, that other PD may not be like.

i had a fairly heated and frustrating discussion ( frustrating towards me that is, because i ended up being the one being belittled ), with a borderline in another place online and all the vibes i got from her were more or less similar to ""typical people"" particularly some of the emotional harmful and traumatic experiences i had elsewhere and in my life in general, but i didn't provide the whole story of her and what happened but yeh, that's a another story...

but i also haven't really connected with anyone else in any PD community either, so it just seems like everything is ""unclear"". for example, i don't see the people who i don't relate to who also have the same PD as me ( schizotypal PD ) as any different than how these ""borderline"" people were, so beats me....

but to answer your question a little differently, Personality disorders may be ""curable"" if they have borderline PD, in the sense that the borderline could through ""personality"" and / or combination of medication, depending on the type of ""borderline"" can function well enough and lead a decent life.

broderline PD is very similar to ADHD, in the sense that if not ""treated"", it can lead to fatal or ""dangerous"" outcomes, but when they do get proper ""treatment"", they can function pretty good, if not more so than the ""Average"" person, though dynamic factors are different in borderline PD vs ADHD, the similarity is that there is this ""potential"" if you will to have a pretty good quality of life and existence, where as with disorders like the one i have and people like me, better situations can help, etc, but you can only do so much.

basically what i'm trying to say is there are more qualitative impairements in StPD in overall life functioning and happiness ( at least for me ), then there is with borderline PD. borderline PD seems like it's worse because of the whole dynamic factor research points out, however, this dynamic factor isn't really factoring that many things, and is mostly focused in one dimension, but not really in other human domains of functioning ( such as ego strength ).

i do have to point out that the question of the OP just isn't right. the question isn't so much about ""curable"" or curing a personality disorder or anyone for the matter, but what can be done for the person to live at a more reasonable functional level and happiness, at least for me."
JordanPeterson,fj8j6il,t1_fj5s7ye,1583114635.0,"i was hoping that since it's online ( not in person ) and people are more likely to wan't to take the time or at least have the capacity to read through things / process everything, maybe not everything, but some, to offer some kind of take of their own that isn't just a general response, but often, i don't get any other answer such as the one you posted, not actually giving a ""personalized"" take on it. 

that being said, it doesn't mean i give excess information always, however, unfortunately, due to the type of people i encounter, regardless of how i seem to go about it, little or big or what other people would call ""excessive"", doesn't seem to make much of a difference, at the end, i always get the same types of responses from people, so it's not a matter of context or way of communication on my part, but simply the type of people i encounter aren't able to ""work with things im asking""...

i don't expect someone to read one part of the post and then assume that from what perception, that it should be perceived this way because typical people perceive it that way, and so they should just provide a answer that doesn't actually answer anything that the original poster may be asking, but unfortunately, this is what ends up happening more than 90 percent of the time. ( hard to explain what this really means to lay people, but i tried my best ). 

the sad part is, for me ( myself ), i'll go into the threads on the other end, the person asking the question and i'll do my best to try to see ""where they are coming from"" and / or provide a response to which would actually answer THEIR questions as best as they'd hope someone could or would appropriately, YET...the same isn't really done on my part, and if it is, their getting the wrong idea or just not getting it.

however, maybe you could ask why i write a lot ( excessive in the first place ), and it's for good reason, because for one, i usually do not come to things to know what i'm actually writing about or being able to feel connections the points im making, and so that's why i write as much as i can at first, so then i don't have to worry about forgetting what's important or what my reasons are for whatever it is i'm bringing up a topic or what not, and it helps, because when i look back and analyze it, then it gives me some sort of relief that i gave all necessary information one could possibly give, so i don't have to feel like it's my ""Fault"" that other people aren't factoring in everything and giving an appropriate response.  

now in person, it's a bit different, because simply the social environment doesn't really allow to get more deeper or have such a conversation and / or the type of people in it and the particular psycho social environment makes it hard to come up with ways at the moment to talk about, but what happens is just as bad, people get the wrong idea because they interpret at first glance something i'm saying, because it was said maybe in a ""simple"" way or what they perceive it to be a simple issue, yet there is much more to it that isn't being communicated or explained.

^whether this is a ""Schizotypal"" issue or ""ISFJ"" interaction style or both, is unclear, what i do know is that i don't relate to the majority of people, even if they have schizotypal PD or are ISFJ. so yes, although the thread title wasn't much on the music personality part, i did write in the title of other experiences, hoping that would offer some kind of leeway for others, that they'd be like, oh, we'll it's obviously not just about music and personality. for me, this wouldn't really matter that much, if i'm gonna be responding, it's because i was curious to know the OP's points more and find maybe a connection with them if i related....., instead of just telling them how they should go about their way of doing things...."
SCT,fihtzw8,t1_fic4p6i,1582414093.0,"i appreciate you taking into account the ADHD factors i layed out, at least the part on the ""true adhd"" hypothesis. and just to clear any misunderstandings, i was not discounting the effort you put into the video at all, both your video and my points are more or less explaining ADHD but through different takes. I just wanted to give a overview on what ADHD really is and avoid misidentifying and in relation to other things such as SCT, which often gets confused as the inattentive form of ADHD or what you have mentioned ADHD-PI. It's a pet peeve of mine of people that have ADHD-PI grouping themselves either intentionally or unintentionally with those with SCT, and so i don't wan't to affiliate myself with those with ADHD, because i just don't relate to them and don't like them ( both from online community experiences but also in person of bumping into them in both clinical and non clinical settings ). 

commorbidity is another story of course and trying to see what SCT people are really like is difficult or close to impossible ( though for online communities at least, i don't relate to most people with ""SCT"" either ), and for in person, we'll i've never met anyone in any particular mental health group bringing it up, and even if they say they related to or not, we'll, i would've found a connection or related, but i didn't for the entirety of the population. as for ADHD, it was pretty common, since the people that often had it were either commorbid with bipolar disorder and / or schizoaffective disorder, and these were the more common mental health conditions i bumped into. one guy in particular with some kind of affective disorder mentioned his struggles with ""ADD"" implying the lack of hyperactivity. he wasn't like those with SCT at all, but then again, there's the whole personality aspect again, and he mentioned he was an INFP in the MBTI."
SCT,fibyxpo,t3_f6sgph,1582333472.0,"i didn't look at the entire video, but a lot of the thing mentioned are more or less addressing the low conscientiousness associated with ADHD, whether this is arising from personality ( NOT ""real ADHD"" ), or genetics ( ""true ADHD"" ), remains unclear, and doctors / professionals have no way of proving this, Barkley of course also pointed out that even with his brain imaging studies, etc, it isn't really possible to tell who is gonna be disordered by looking at things in the structural level.

I know this will sway a bit from the topic and what i'm gonna write, but one thing needs to be made clear, ADHD-PI is still part of the same disorder as ADHD, and it is not SCT under a different name, and this video has clearly shown that ADHD-PI people are more or less similar to each other ( which was part of the point to the video anyways ), assuming SCT is not in the picture as commorbidity, but then again commorbidity really makes things confusing.

It's much easier looking at Russell Barkley's videos found on youtube ( specifically in chronological order ) for a better / more accurate idea of what type of problems you really have and things that are more likely to be solutions, however the problem is, a large proportion of people who view them often misunderstand / misinterpret what Barkley says or don't take into account everything, ( common in those who only have ADHD for example ), due to their ""comprehension"" and ""persistence"" problems.

I do not have any type of ""ADHD"", but i do relate to SCT largely but not everything. i have ongoing major depression and also schizotypal personality disorder, and for me, watching barkley's videos was not an issue at all for me, i actually made sure i persisted to all of the video and contents, as i didn't wan't to miss something that would have been important to know and it ensures that i am getting the real context to everything. It's ironic how typical ""ADHD"" people aren't like this, but then again, creativity doesn't measure qualitative value, it's just measures whether or not you're ""creative"" ( think of entrepreneurs who try to innovate or fix things that are not broke, only to make things more complicated and worse). they like those with ADHD may be spontaneous and adaptable, ( something i'm not ), but that doesn't mean what they do is particularly well or good, which is the same reason why medications don't improve the quality and functioning of those with ADHD or similar types of people so much, because it wasn't a qualitative problem, if anything, it was a quantitative problem making it seem like a qualitative problem."
SCT,fibw3c4,t3_f741s0,1582331505.0,"the problems you stated are much more quantitative than qualitative, the ""sluggish cognitive tempo"" in SCT is not just from hormone and chemical imbalances, it's a combination of personality, environment, living circumstances, nature / nurture and genes all working together, and so Barkley's 50/50 analysis is spot on with this ( at least for me ) , in the sense that all these factors affect my overall functioning, though some ""symptoms"" still remain consistent, and this doesn't need to be a hormone or chemical problem, but rather just the way i am ( personality wise ).

what you described is not that, but rather typically seen in classic depression NOT associated with SCT or commorbid, especially the part you mentioning that people mentioning for you to engage in yoga or cardio, but your response was we'll...i can't fucking move, isn't likely a qualitative issue, but rather quantitative, indicating what seems to be a desire for you to actually want to do these things, but held back quantitatively...

sure, most people with depression have like what you called the typical form of self loathing, but that's also why i was making the earlier distinctions of commorbidity of SCT and / or true nature of SCT, and so again, you're symptoms are better explained by depression only, and NOT SCT, however research up to this point hasn't provided enough information on what SCT people are really like, and so treatment would vary significantly, since like mentioned previously, personality, environmental, and other factors play a role, and clearly if someone resembles one disorder that is catastrophically different from another person, then treatment is likely not gonna work for that one person and may even be harmful and damaging.

 for example, CBT helping one patient with SCT tremendously, while significantly damaging and harming another ( such as myself ), as i have done so in the past ( without even knowing the sessions were CBT ), and all it did was make me more mentally ill and lowered my IQ even more, but that's understandable because neither was the group itself appropriate but the anger and worsening of illness it caused to me also had to do with not relating to the people in it. it's like going to a anonymous group full of people with problems you don't have and whom you don't relate to and then attending the group making it seem like your doing what they do and like what they do, when you don't and not trying to, but their too stupid to know you don't relate, but neither do you have anywhere else to throw yourself into either, so you kind of just ""tag along"" in a agitated way of course. 

and all of these examples i gave matter in terms of what kind of people your dealing with and what routes / interventions or things are appropriate for the particular person at hand."
Schizotypal,fi65hy1,t3_f5e7aa,1582179694.0,"i use to think something similar such as the borderline and schizotypal issue, however, eventually i found a qualitative distinction and no longer associated myself with borderlines based off mostly from real life experience with those who had borderline PD, so much, that i don't wan't to have a thing to do with them. when from years back, before i even got diagnosed with Schizotypal PD, i was ""Self diagnosing"" myself as borderline PD, because through general criteria and writing, i thought being this way of emotionally unstable was how ""borderlines"" felt, only to be exposed to other info, etc, explaining other reasoning behind it. 

the problem with commorbidity is that you end up just putting everything together with the whole spectrum way of dealing with things and to me, it's just not helpful, i hate the whole spectrum way of treating things, at least in more specific things like these. like, when i'd view those with pure avoidant PD, they are just very different from me, it's not just a small difference of coping mechanisms, etc. but then again, i do not feel the same way with the people with StPD either. 

the only ones i related to closest are more of sub labels such as timorous schizotypals, and vulnerable narcissism, or certain traits from what literature has done on passive aggressive personality disorder, even though i have ongoing severe depression ( since MDD would rule out Passive aggressive PD ). first diagnosed with depression at age 18, now age 27. 

but really with the whole borderline and StPD relationship, you could say that temperamentally they seem similar, but in terms of what they feel and what they are reacting to is different. i made this same hypothesis on schizoid vs avoidant personality disorder, being that temperamentally, they are actually more similar to each other, so much, that i'd put them in the same cluster, but then this cluster would be a different type of cluster, not in the way that the DSM would categorize them as. both schizoids and avoidants have this sort of calmer outward demeanor, like this way of simplicity to them where this perceptual navigation is inwards. i attribute this mostly to them being Fi users ( introverted feelers in the MBTI ), so most of them being ISTJ / ISFP / INTJ / INFP, where as the majority of borderlines and schizotypals are probably Fe types ( extroverted feeling types in the MBTI ), such as INTP, INFJ, ISFJ, and ENTP. however, enneagram probably may be a role to this. enneagram 2s and 9s are more likely to be avoidant, with 5s being more likely to be schizoid, where as enneagram 6s are more likely to be mainly schizotypal. borderlines through research are more dynamic ( any enneagram type probably ), another reason to support my hypothesis that it's not really a true PD, but rather some form of traumatic conditioning that has made them the way that they are, where as with StPD, it's just the way they are, where trauma is a commorbidity, but not the cause to why they are the way they are. 

i always felt like personality disorder NOS matched me better in the sense that i have what it takes to meet criteria for a personality disorder but not matching any specific one, because my problems aren't really explained by any in particular. what is explained is not how i feel, but rather how i function, meaning that in the four domains of functioning, i have significant impairments in all of them."
SCT,fi62esg,t3_f58k8n,1582176796.0,"we'll first of all, SCT doesn't / should not belong to any category with ADHD, second, stimulants shouldn't be helping you, long history on research of SCT will tell you that, also relatively, and as a pet peeve of mine, a lot of the cases here on reddit and elsewhere are really those with the inattentive form of ADHD ( ADHD-PI ) which is not the same as SCT, yet these people place themselves in the SCT category either intentionally or unintentionally, as if they are trying to explain the same thing, when they aren't. much of the reasoning to most of them being undiagnosed ADHD people is their lack of comprehension of the subject and matter. those with ADHD typically have poor observational and practical critical thinking skills ( they often don't factor in all the details and jump to broad conclusions ), even though the information is relatively straightforward and clear, but they somehow ""miss"" or don't take these things into consideration, even though all they needed to do was look at Russell Barkley's youtube videos with a more conscientious perspective.

most of those could just be said that they lack ""persistence"", however, this doesn't seem to be the case, and research has shown that those with ADHD that take medication don't necessarily improve if any in comprehension or accuracy, if there is any improvement, it's in areas to which they are already like, there could be a personality influence on this as it relates to MBTI ( with the intuitive types and SP types in the MBTI being the ones with these issues ). also, this isn't just my opinion, this is backed by research, both from Barkley's perspective on ADHD, but also on the MBTI, i do not have any specific literature or links but it's been pointed out in various places that talk about personality.

with SCT, you don't really see all that or shouldn't, although the typical person may not be able to tell the difference, because they aren't seeing the context and all the details to the situation, they'd likely attribute these ""SCT"" symptoms as simply another list of quantitative problems, second of all, it's not as simple as you put it. not everyone like you will take a stimulant and something like strattera for a month and be fine or happy in the way that you describe, neither is it a practical or logical solution, and for many, this is not what they do or what their life revolves around, side effects to say the least being a problem. those with true SCT have poor psychosocial / interpersonal functioning and lower ego strength levels. they have much bigger issues such as unfavorable environmental and living circumstances and commorbid severe depression or other mental illness than a matter of being more productive, or having better attention, or less of sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms as you put out and the majority of the people here on reddit and publicly have illustrated the same perspectives as you....

the reason why research hasn't found treatment is because of many variables. Barkley's research has somewhat slowly faded publicly, being that he is almost retired from his area or at least gonna be very soon, i'm not sure. the last bit of his research has been helpful as it's supported his research more accurately, providing even more support the research he's done on the distinctions on SCT are valid, however, this answers the questions on the distinctions, but not so much on what exactly the type of people SCT really are, both on a neurobiological level, but also in terms of the way they function in life, and what sort of outcomes or treatments would be helpful, not just medication wise. so you could say that he's done a lot in terms of seeing what SCT people aren't ( limited scope ), but not so much on what SCT people ARE like. though this can be pointed out vice versa. at the end, it's all premature or unclear.

i'm afraid that what research has been done on SCT up to this point is gonna be conceptualized inaccurately later on and those who truly have it like me are gonna be left in the dark possibly, because they aren't like the rest of the folks that these online communities have expressed."
depression,fh8mto0,t3_f1djgl,1581363069.0,"nope, as someone who has severe depression, i don't relate to any of the points you made, but then again, i'm not the ""typical"" person with depression, i also have schizotypal personality disorder and don't relate to the majority of people who have any type of depression, but i also don't relate to the majority, if not every single person i've met with schizotypal PD, both online or through coincidence in person ( if i had happen to bump into any )."
isfj,fggqg7f,t3_et1oz3,1580767291.0,"i have somewhat conflicting results, in the sense at least one of the traits that came up as my top 5, shouldn't even belong there at all, which was adaptability. of course, you're the test taker and your results are based off what you put into the test, and so in one sense, it wasn't that surprising to me on why i got adaptability, being that, more than half my answers were neutral or in the middle, and the adaptability trait somehow came as my top 5, because i scored so weak or neutral in many other traits, and somehow unintentionally made myself seem like i'm ""Adaptable"", according to what the test seems to measure. 

the other trait which was part of my top 5 also i don't feel it belongs there, mainly in general because of it's negative connotation, but also because specifically it describes me as being a ""perfectionist"" which i wouldn't want to be described as, or someone who has to always go overboard in trying to do things the best way possible, which in a way, sounds like you're obligated to do things unnecessarily or w.e, and i do not feel this way at all about things. if i like to do something for the better, it's something that should be a bonus and / or specifically at a time or period where i can offer a reasonable performance as to show proficiency in a certain area and that i know what i'm doing, though this is kind of getting away from the actual meaning. anyways, the trait was maximizer i also scored as my top 5 which i don't wan't to affiliate with. 

the other 3 traits on my main top 5 were consistency ( obviously relate to ), harmony ( obviously relate to ), and deliberateness ( very accurate and 100 percent true, and i like this trait very much, because it shows that i'm clear, straightforward, down to earth, concise and don't speak in vague, etc ), though the down to earth part comes from the fact of having harmony + deliberateness together, since deliberateness without harmony would actually be annoying / irritating to me if i had to work with someone who didn't also have harmony at least. 

now there was 2 other ones which i looked at, since i needed something to replace maximizer and adaptability, and the only 2 ones that i happen to relate to well enough in wanting to be part of my top 5 was context and belief, however, the context part also rubs me in the wrong way / puts a burden on me, since in a way, it obligates me to have to constantly be doing something in order to manage psyhosocial / interpersonal relationships, like i have to be a mediator in a way for people who are unreasonable and lack conscientioiusness / mindfulness / and thougthfulness. 

as a result, the context theme is like a double edged sword, you're likely to improve situations, yes i agree on this as i've helped people and situations be handled better through mentioning things like being more patient, more carious particularly by pointing something out that would offer some kind of stability or guideline in real time or future anticipated events, but it requires so much damn effort, depending whom i work with, it just makes my mental illness, depression and stress overbearing, not to mention that it doesn't always work of course. this is also why the adaptability  thing is a huge problem, it's like, sure, i might on the literal end look like i'm being adaptable on the outside, but what you managed to do is cause extreme suffering, impairment, and as a result, depression and illness in me...

i guess my point is that i shouldn't have to be called unhealthy or doing the wrong thing if i'm not actively providing this context trait in my environment, like if someone is taking down other people, i shouldn't have to just jump in midst, sacrifice myself, not even know what i'm doing, just so i can save that person from doing something that doesn't make sense or whatever. but i don't know if this is necessarily part of the context theme or not, maybe someone can chime in and provide input of what it might be. 

and then there's the belief trait, and the reason why i wanted this to be part of my top 5 is because it says that this is who i am, and that i'm not gonna just do something, just for the sake of it, though not necessarily a belief thing, it really has to do the logic and reasoning behind something. i don't have a problem being called judgmental or being strongly opinionated towards people or things of different value, especially if someone were to say i'm intolerant of people with different viewpoints, since that's the whole point in who i am as a person. i do not like flatter for example, nor would i like to flatter other people either. if i don't like you as a person, but you're willing to at least work with in middle ground and be considerate, then we can have a ""deal"". i'm not taking anything away from you, you can still excel in the traits you have that are different than mine, but the point is like the cliftonstrengths puts, is about bringing the best in everyone and putting this together in teamwork, so that everyone can be of significance in the right manner and function well both personally and also when working together with others. 

so if i were to state what my actual top 5 traits would be, so far, i'd put them as these below:

\-consistency 

\-deliberateness

\-harmony

\-belief

\-context 

as a side note, i never got around to following up with the place that introduced me to the cliftonstrengths, as i really wanted to talk to them or someone in person about it to see what traits would explain me best in terms of functioning most naturally or whatever. there are  youtube videos on it, but i really would want to talk about in person at least one time in follow up. i can't get the full 34 traits, since it costs money and i can't cover that unfortunately."
Schizotypal,ffvptgq,t3_eux4xe,1580269939.0,"we'll i have schizotypal PD and ongoing severe depression, and i have tried two SSRIs before for about a month a few years back, stopped abruptly due to simultaneously getting sick ( comprised immune system? ) from either a virus or maybe the psychiatric medication itself ( has happened with other psych drugs ) so i don't thing they are a coincidence that i simply caught a flu or virus, but i see it having everything to do with the psychiatric medications WORSENING me. 

the zoloft and prozac withdrawal were torture ( tooken seperately fyi ), i almost had to tell my mom to rush me to urgent care or something because it's as if someone was constantly shocking my brain from the amount of brain chemistry changes the drugs did, and i felt this insane amount of restlessness, anxiety, and sick to the gut feeling, and forceful feeling to vomit, which nothing would come out when i tried to force myself to vomit. sure, stopping abruptly was a problem, but then again, i didn't have guidance on this part, if only someone could have helped...

what i learned about medications, is that if i ever go back to taking any psychiatric based antidepressant, it will NEVER be a SSRI or anything close to it, so anything that has the potential of causing serotonin syndrome, etc, and the fact that i'd have to worry about tapering off, forgetting about taking, worse withdrawals the longer i stay on something. that being said, i do not take any type of medication currently, and do not know what could be helpful. the only safest option i think could help me meaningfully with little to no side effects would be some kind of serotonin 5-HT1A agonist ( CBD oil being one of them, though pricey so i have not been able to try it ), since from what i researched, 5-HT1A would seem to help with my particular type of problems more closely, for example, i already know a lot of my problems have to do with both the reward / hormone parts of my brain, particularly the lateral hypothalamus do not work properly due to both severe emotional and physiological stress combined with lack of reward functioning due to complex reasons, both personality wise, environmental / living circumstances, but also neurophysiologically, particularly the pre frontal cortex not working properly, and the 5-HT1A agonist medicine could be a potential in helping these areas so then i can function better, have better brain functioning, manage extreme stress, etc. 

however, i looked into other stuff, opiates, gaba, melanocortin, dopamine receptors, etc particularly dopamine d2, and d2 is another one i think could be helpful, but i don't want to just experiment with my body on and on so sporadically like i'd do in the past. one would ask, we'll, how have you been functioning without medicine, we'll, that's from sexual release! as serotonin is released into the lateral hypothalamus upon ejaculation ( keeps my depression from becoming too severe ), but if i somehow go without one day of ejaculating, then my depression slowly but quickly enough gets so extreme, that i can't even manage to put food in my mouth, eat, sleep or do anything, and develop extreme stress and fight or flight adrenaline, and severe brain inflammation, i start to cry very easily and constantly, my face turns into very droopy fixture, and i can barely keep my eyes open and alert, also my body temperature drops and other problems. i normally sexual release twice every day, but sometimes, for reasons where i have to prepare myself for something like social situations, i limit to one, because when it's once every 24 hours, then the biology is such in a way that i can manage myself slightly better, for example, communicate and handle interpersonal situations or myself a little better and slightly better senses such as when navigating environments and being aware of my surroundings, compared to doing it twice in 24 hours, but at minimum, it needs to be once every 24 hours, or then it goes into the non functioning fatal extreme depression where it's extreme torture, which i've only got into that state a few times. so it's a unique effect, the functionality goes up enough where i can be reasonable functional if done every 24 hours, however, if extended more, then functionality will quickly drop to eventually not functional at all. 

i told my psychologist about this before in detail, and she said it may have to do somehow with the recycling of the serotonin of the brain. we'll i mentioned this specifically when i talked to her about food intake, where in my typical state, when i eat stuff like chocolate, it gives me a sense of reward and good feeling when eating, however, if i reach into the boundaries and state where i start to end up in the extreme non functional state if i didn't have sexual release within 24 hour or so, then if i try to eat something like chocolate that normally would make me feel good, then i end up not feeling anything from it, and of course, even later if i tried to eat, i wouldn't be able to even eat it all because of how messed up my brain would be. one reason could be that obviously when i get into this stage, the stress becomes so severe, and deficiencies, that the melanocortin doesn't function.  the reason why i think melanocortin might be one of the things is because it's part of the hypothalamus, as well as other important things. it also may explain why CBD oil might be beneficial since it works on   [endocannabinoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid), which is located in the lateral hypothalamus, and by it working on those with it's opiate effects and serotonin 5-HT1A agonist properties, could possibly help me. 

if anyone wanted sources for any of these things, i do have some i can list."
Schizotypal,ffvluva,t3_evcdr6,1580267175.0,"to be honest, from my experience, the few ""schizoids"" i know, which really are the ones online but also a few in person who specifically said they were ""schizoids"", they were / are a lot different than me, so much that i wouldn't even put them in the same category of PDs. i relate more to those with borderline PD ( but only so much in certain temperamental ways, and not the way we feel or think about things ), so you could say, i get stressed and angry easily, but how it's expressed and what i get stressed and angry about is different. i am diagnosed with schizotypal PD and have ongoing severe depression ( i do not take any type of medication ). 

the problem with the schizoid PD criteria or any other criteria is often it doesn't give the reason WHY someone would relate to that or not. 

also, there's a covert profile on schizoid PD that i relate to every trait from, but then when you lump me with other people with schizoid PD, i don't relate to them at all.., and no surprise, they don't relate to most traits from the covert profile ( much of the psychforums.com community and elsewhere )..., the profile was created by salman akhtar. one trait in particular that was listed under the covert profile was intensely needy of involvement with others. now this was something i was like in my earlier adult years and teen years, where i insisted that i could tag along with my brother and his friends when he'd go to parties, not always of course, but there was a need to wan't to be part of the group, even if socially, i was challenged, etc. much of the reason to wanting to go to places in social environments, etc, is that i could not stand isolation and boredom at home for too long, and this is also the main reason why i took college classes in person, was so that i could be involved and just out there, because i liked to put myself out there and have my presence noticed. sitting at home all the time was torture, so i'd ask my parents if i could come with them to parties that typically were just grown ups that were a lot older, 40s,50s, and older, and i didn't mind not having people around my age in the 20s or w.e, if anything, it was better and i'd prefer it like that. 

now this changed more so later on in my adult years when both my relationship with my brother and also my personality changed more so ( i've had many episodes and experiences of abuse and trauma, physically and emotionally from him ), and as of now, we don't even talk directly, and for safety reasons, i no longer can talk to him directly, and when my mom is around, i have to just talk to as much as possible indirectly, unless, in certain situations where i may manage to ask him something casual, like, can you move your chair or something like that, but other times, i am paralyzed ( as to avoid another episode or potential situation that could lead into out of control / ""psychosis"" ) and can't talk or speak up and end up having to tell my mom or say what i need to do indirectly. my mom of course understands all this as she's like the moderator in all this in a way. another trait in particular i relate to from the covert profile is envious of other's spontaneity. also, the same with college classes is no more, partly because that there isn't anything interesting to take anymore and also because it doesn't make any more sense, but also some other reasons like needing to get a grade and what not. since a lot of the classes i took in college, i'd drop out, or not pass them, from interpersonal reasons, emotional problems, type of work needed, etc, financial reasons, and i just can no longer distract myself with things to fill in this empty agony life i have to live with.

also, i no longer go to parties anymore or get togethers with family either, or at least make attempts to avoid them, unless they are at my house, where i have no choice to be part of them, but yeh, this was finally a point i had to make to my mom, after one episode in particular as my dad was driving me back because i couldn't tolerate anymore and didn't feel well, he pushed my buttons in the car ( my dad is a narcissist btw, ) and then i started having catatonia / echolalia symptoms, while at the same time my depression mixed / agitation / restlessness ), and basically told him, do not ever take me / tell me to come to anywhere anymore, i am not coming anymore to anywhere, and shortly, i let my mom know cuz she arrived home soon after. however, for me, the echolalia part wasn't meaningless repetition of words, it was more of a survival mechanism where i had no other way of letting the other person know they are ""the problem"", so i was imitating my dad's words in order for him to shut up and stop doing the same thing with me that he always did, ( he still doesn't learn though ). this symptom or way of being did not need to occur if im in a more depressive stage, though the worser the depression is ongoing, the more likely i'd react this way. 

as for StPD, could you explain how exactly you have abnormal perceptual experiences and magical thinking and ideas of reference? honestly, the only part i see myself fitting that would make me ""odd"" or ""unusual"" is the ideas of reference part, however, this is with an assumption that the ideas of reference i have are things that are outside cultural or societal norms of thinking. 

like for example, i'll have strong beliefs about some frustrations and viewpoints on things, and i'll impose a viewpoint that seems ""odd"" or makes me seem hypochondriac or maybe along the lines of having what people would refer to as somatic disease, where what you believe is attributed to something physical, yet, they have no proof whether what i am saying is indeed false and why it would be false. (that's my biggest frustration) is that people will trivialize me, treat me as if i'm some ""normal"" or ""neurotypical"" person, and that the ideas i have no relevance or reasoning behind them, because they're too busy looking at the emotional connection of me to these things, rather than doing some critical thinking of their own and give their opinion and say, we'll, i don't think that's the case, and so it can be a normal disagreement, without sounding like they know everything."
Schizotypal,ffipqft,t1_ffimj7x,1579979653.0,"don't know if you know about this or willing to give the info for it, but have ever done the MBTI test and know your result? it does give SOME reasoning on why you may or may not relate to those around you. in my case, despite being the most common MBTI type ( ISFJ ), i wouldn't relate to those around me at all, anymore than the superficial, yet they'd pigeonhole or treat me as a neurotypical, ""normal"", or ""simple"" person, all of which would create intense anger in me. even though, they could say the same about themselves, such as the superficial, that wouldn't matter, because i can already see things that are transparent ( nuanced ), and letting them know about it would kind of be too casual in it's attempt, for example, holding back my opinion on certain things about when other people comment on or talk about themselves, because i'll have strong feelings, resentment or envy towards them, that would lead into a out of control situation because it'd be very clear and evident that i hate them and have disgust ( strong feeling ) and there's no rational way i could really play this out, so i have to conscientiously dismiss it ( what the schizotypal person would do to survive in life and force themselves to be impersonal ). 

like this one girl in a mental health group had mentioned how she was the first in her family to achieve a degree ( im not sure if it was college or university level ), but regardless, any degree for that matter requires a pretty decent amount of capacity and aptitude, and immediately, i thought to myself, we'll, for me, it's the opposite, but i held back on the opinion of telling it out loud in the group that, we'll, for me, it's the opposite, almost every single person in my family has some kind of degree, around bachelor's and higher, where i don't. it's not that having the degree or not makes me any less of a person, i actually would rather not have any type of degree or certificate since people wouldn't think i have more potential or capacity than i REALLY have, but it does point in one direction of what kind of person you're dealing with, and generally those with higher education, have better ability to manage life in general and function, both in quality of life and overall functioning. 

i had to think about this a lot, because i often am confused on whether my perception about things is really true, since i need to challenge this with other people whom i have the leverage of reaching such conclusions with, which mainly would be my therapist who i regularly see twice a week, over a year now with the same one, or my mom, time from time, but both people can't really go too much into what i am saying and often just give an answer that i know isn't accurate or true, but often because i don't really have a way of providing a disagreement or counterargument, i just shrug my shoulders and say, yeh, i suppose. it's not that i'm agreeing with what the person is saying, but just trying to let them know, alright, so from what you say, it's like this, but in my head i'm like, yeh...., that's not how research explained it in full detail though...., neither does it make logical sense, but, to prevent me from looking illogical or paranoid about the discussion, i have to sort of tame myself gradually out of the discussion and then find something to say that does make sense, maybe changing the topic entirely if necessary, so it doesn't get out of hand. 

i've created a research survey thing ( yet to ever be published ) that asks a lot of various questions on personality, lifestyle, living mechanisms, etc, and it's my hope i can get this in public or w.e and provide a more accurate analysis of mental health or related problems ( as i haven't found anything as practical yet detailed as the one i have ), so people can feel more understood / relieved better and hopefully they could then find better treatments, whether it's medication of any kind, therapeutic treatment, etc. as i definitely see a lot of flaws in today's research, one of which is that a lot of research is often done on non clinical university populations and already when you're measuring people at this level, it's a problem, because some conditions if they are that impairing, wouldn't allow such a person to even get that far, ( qualitative limitation ), not quantitative, and when you combine that with inaccurate observations for these conditions, it creates a problem, because they collect traits of people and try to assume it's part of some kind of disability or disorder, when really, what they are seeing is a normal personality, not a personality disorder."
SCT,ffhgzmj,t3_et9q86,1579934831.0,"learning to drive for me wasn't so much the problem, i did manage to pass the driving test and been driving for many years since then and ongoing. however, i will say that i do drive differently from most people. it's too much effort to explain it, but i did give a post on it on a thread in the schizotypal forum, as i am diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder and major depression. the thread was on fear of driving. 

but for driving, what is difficult for me is that i need to ensure i'm being adequately focused and careful, and prevent myself from ever making any impulsive decisions or allowing my brain to somehow make me hypomanic or too much on the go, because if i don't be conscientiousness enough, even just for a split second, i could end up in a accident because my attention becomes either too ""hypomanic"" or ""all over the place"", and so it feels like in a way, a brick wall is in front of my face and i might miss something in my environment and hit it and just press go, when i shouldn't have. 

also, i eventually had to let my family know that i can't drive with others in the car ( my post on fear of driving explains this in the schizotypal forum ). 

now i mentioned hypomania, even though i don't have any diagnosis of any manic depressive illnesses or any forms of affective or bipolar disorder, i still wonder what may be the mechanism behind why i'm not able to handle these executive domains of functioning.

and i don't think it's necessarily adhd commorbid, neither do i think it's being rushed by the environment, pressure or restlessness ONLY, however, i do feel that the whole forehead theory measurement that was done on forehead size and type do make sense. as someone who has a relatively narrow forehead AND sloped type, i feel like this itself is largely why i am not able to handle doing things, and why also it affects so many other aspects of my life, from past till present. since the area is involved in so many things, as it relates to intelligence, planning, regulating temper and emotions, decision making, organizing, etc. so much, that i feel like if my forehead physiological traits were ""normal"", then i'd be much more functional overall, and particularly in quality of life, since if my neurophysiological networks can work with less strain and less effort, then everyday tasks would then be a lot less stressful. 

however, even if that doesn't explain the reasoning, then there has to be some kind of genetic / nature reasoning. and it's unclear whether the bump / groove on my head is the cause of any of the impairements and / or what caused the forehead shaping, etc, and / or if the bump is a genetic thing, ( born with it ), or if there all seperate issues? i did get hit in the head when i was younger, mild injury, and so i don't know if this caused the bump and / or the other things."
SCT,ffg9bsv,t3_ebg5v4,1579901252.0,"i inquired about this to a recent neurologist, because i wanted to see if there was a way to find out what could be ""Wrong"" or different about my brain and found out that Qeeg is something that regular neurologists don't do, but something that's done non traditionally by certain people, usually in universities. ( same for Fmri, since i mentioned that too as something i wanted to do ).

she of course, didn't accept my other hypothesis as valid, which is trying to say that one reason why i am not able to function well, has to do with either the mild head injury i got on my head when i was younger causing the skull and brain to not fully develop properly or develop improperly, for example, growing faster in one area and not enough in another.

so it explains why i have a relatively narrow forehead and my skull on top is bumpy, because the bump had to do with the mild injury i got when i was really young and the narrow forehead and sloped is either caused by it and / or genetically influenced, so either way, even if the bump or injury wasn't the cause of any impairement in development, etc, then genetically, i still was born inferior.

>i guess my point is that if you're gonna disapprove of one thing i say, then something else would need to make sense, and i laid out options that are logical enough of being likely of explaining the reasoning to why i have the impairments i always had and / or developed. if it's not neurophysiological from nurture, and neither is it genetic, then the only other thing it would be is nature, if they are not treating it as commorbid or combination of factors that is. so again, if you're gonna be disagreeing with my point and tell me it's all in my head, i'd expect a answer that does provide good reasoning of what may be the problem, but then i suppose like my mom says, they wouldn't wan't to do that, because what would then appear to be the ""truth"" would be too painful and that would cause me to trigger into a rage and become out of control and before i know, in a extreme hypothetical case, end up in a mental hospital or drugged ( tranquilized some way ) or beaten down by the police some way that would be emotionally damaging or traumatic.

now for any other neurofeedback stuff. i did do a regular MRI, EEG and PET scans, and all came back normal, but that didn't mean shit, because they aren't measuring real world / real life functioning in a variety of circumstances, and besides the fact that they aren't specific enough and detailed enough to explain brain regions and functioning, and if they aren't working well, to understand where the imbalances may be coming from what stimulus or trigger. it's like giving a test to two people where person A scored slightly lower on neuroticism than person B, but actually person A is the one who is significantly more impaired in quality of life, overall functioning, and emotional stability, but the answers were in such a way that measured quality of life and functioning in a subjective way ( making it seem like person B ) was more impaired, when they weren't. 

i wouldn't have the money to cover Qeeg and Fmri yet, though i'm not sure if it would be a viable option, regardless of whether i had the money to do it or not. 

i'd be more interested on more information on yourself as it relates to SCT or related stuff."
Schizotypal,ffe80xj,t3_er6tv3,1579839204.0,"i'm 26 right now ( 27 soon ), but right after high school (age 18) is when i first starting seeking mental health services where i saw my first psychologist who first diagnosed me with JUST depression and anxiety which i knew that my problems were much more complex than that. this is when i took the MMPI-2 for the first time. 

later on, a few years later, i then saw a different psychologist who also administered me the MMPI-2, he was the first to diagnosis me with schizotypal personality disorder alongside depression. i'm not sure how old exactly i was, but i think i was 21. he also did a comprehensive IQ test and a ADHD test because i insisted i may have had some form of ADHD but that was ruled out. my IQ result indicated that i was in the ""average"" range of functioning.  

what was ironic but NOT surprising was two things, one, i never even knew about / researched schizotypal PD beforehand. you know, you'd think that you'd come across something that is relatable or explains you similarly, but i didn't up to the point before i received my diagnosis of StPD, and two, i always thought i had borderline personality disorder before that, which makes sense because the two are similar in certain things such as emotional dysregulation, etc, but the motivation, coping styles / defense mechanisms for example, being different for one. 

when you say case manager, i couldn't help but think of a similar situation as what i went through in my older insurance ( kaiser ). now i have medical cal optima. do you mind me asking how you got accessed in more detail, like whether or not they actually professionally tested you through tests such as the MMPI-2 and / or other routes, because i kind of felt the same way when i had kaiser case management system, the psychiatrist also had no clue on my diagnosis and almost killed me with the latuda medication she prescribed me thinking it would help with my ""symptoms"" to which i described to her at the time as ""Anger"" being one that seemed to tell her that an anti psychotic was the right option for someone with severe depression...., not knowing that sent me to the hospital from it's torturing ""side effects"", some of which included on the third night of not taking it anymore, extreme difficulty breathing, developing crying spells and screaming with on and off violent brain jerking and convulsions where i had to be rushed to the hospital by my parents. i filed grievance later on, and despite being misunderstood and trying to seek help and doing literally everything they told me, the case manager at the time would still reject my viewpoints as being invalid and distorted, while simultaneously telling me that i'm running around circles because she can't fathom what's it's like to be in my own shoes. 

one of her reasoning was that i would go to DBSA groups when i don't have bipolar disorder, and i was like, we'll, that place isn't strictly for those with bipolar disorder, technically it says for those with depression OR bipolar, second, even if it's meant for those with manic depressive illness, which unfortunately i see it being like that, that shouldn't mean that ONLY people with manic depressive illness should go in there or related, second, she where are people supposed to go that don't have these conditions if they aren't any ""unipolar specific depression"" groups, we'll they have to go somewhere and so i didn't have any other choices, we'll i tried NAMI groups too but they were full of manic depressive people often in there too, i wen't outside insurance and paid out of pocked when i'm already financially in burden and still couldn't find an appropriate group, and then she tells me, i'm doing the wrong things...."
Schizotypal,feovboe,t3_eoae7j,1579306196.0,"the problem with people liking you is that they may like you for different reasons than to which you or at least I would wan't them to like me for. for example, i wouldn't want someone to like me because they see my problems as trivial and that i'm a easy going person who's challenges are less than theirs and that i'm a nice guy, who just overthinks things..., instead, i'll be like, the heck with you, i don't care about your opinion, your scum to me.

now if the person were to like me because they see me as inferior in the sense that see me having very hard complex challenges ( whether they are inferior themselves or more superior, that doesn't seem to matter much ), but their view of me being inferior isn't in a bad way, such as what the typical grandiose narcissist would think, but rather they'd see it as something they appreciate and respect about me, that despite the hardships and challenges i have, i'm still alive and existing, despite how fucked up life is and what i have to constantly go through.

they aren't calling me resilient and neither would i wan't them to do so. i don't relate to resilience at all. i see that as a label that's only applicable to ""typical"" people where i am not part of this group of ""typical people"". it would actually tick me off if someone told me i'm resilient or give me a specific word to describe me, because not only do i not relate to it, but it's also fake and doesn't actually explain in detail the specific hardships and problems.

this is also why when i'd go to groups where people would talk and throw these labels around to each other to make each other feel better, not only would i not relate to it, but it would also anger me. now back to the social and being liked part, for me, the only way that either of these two would work we'll is if i were to be on medication, some kind of natural antidepressant ( NON SSRI ), since i have severe depression, and maybe things can be somewhat manageable, but even if on medicine, if i'm around those who i do not like and give me a hard time or w.e, then the medicine can only do so much. you know, it's not that my perception of these people is wrong, most of these people are lousy or w.e.

it's a bad sad that in a way but also unclear, that whether i would be taking this medication for managing some kind of brain chemistry / hormonal or other physiological problem, etc, being more of the issue, or would it be so i can just tolerate these lousy people better and not have to worry about killing myself, just so these people can tame down and work at a better middle ground. you know, they being the real abusers, and the medication is there so i can tolerate their abuse, the question is, how much, and does that still mean i can be ""myself"" and function properly?"
Schizotypal,fe5xcbr,t3_enljxm,1578877041.0,"for me, it's not a fear of driving but rather other problems. one problem is having to drive for too long, since it's stressful and can be both physically and mentally fatiguing for me. driving itself requires a decent amount of attentiveness and effort, not because i'm in la la land, but because of the whole spatial reasoning and other things that other people seem to function very well in and naturally do, i don't, and function differently and if my attention or decision making falls off just a little bit, i could get into an accident. and in accordance to this, at some point, i had to let my family know that i can't drive other people or will refuse to do so as this affected my ability to drive a lot, so if you need a ride or something, then either you're gonna be the one driving or find someone else.

one general reason to why i refuse to drive others is because it become somewhat paralyzed and don't check my mirrors or other areas to which i need to be aware of when driving and so when i need to turn left or right, my vision or whatever becomes obstructed, because i just look straight but not in other areas that i would normally consciously look in when i would drive alone. i would say i am a good driver ( when driving alone ), because of my effort and sustained need to do so, otherwise, i'd be very off or doing things erratically or impulsively and when i find myself doing this, it can be dangerous because then of course my mood and emotions can cause me to become too hyper vigilant to my surroundings and then ultimately, i can put myself into danger.

the thing i noticed with a lot of passengers is that they put their seat too far back and slanted and for me ( the driver ), that would affect my ability to check my blind spot and it would be annoying having to ask or tell every person to adjust their seat in a way, because i have to have clear view of my blindspot ( i have a limitation in my ability to communicate and be assertive ), and so often in the past, i ended up having to drive where others had the seat in a way that was uncomfortable and awkward for me to look over my shoulders, and as a result, i just wouldn't ( became paralyzed ), and would only look at my mirrors or side of the passenger but not in the rightside of blindspot. it's something i notice with other people's car seat location for the passenger side and i wonder to myself, how aren't these drivers affected by this? for example, my brother isn't bothered by this at all, his passenger seat would usually be pretty far back and slanted, although when i'd sit in his car as passenger, i'd usually bring it back to a more normal level that's appropriate for me, because it would feel awkward for me sitting there and noticing him looking over his shoulders right at me, so i'd try to adjust in a way that's of course comfortable for me but perhaps maybe more helpful on his view.

also another thing i noticed is that a lot of people who are somehow checking their ""blindspots"", don't really do it in the same way i do, like with me, i completely look to my right physically moving my head and body, where as a lot of these other people just kind of look briefly in the right direction but don't actually look at a specific point, like their peripheral vision is enough to change the lane or w.e, but for me, i have to literally look directly in that area to see if there is a object or whatever, and simultaneously do the maneuver, almost like i can't do this thing that ""normal"" people do, i have to do it in my own way. 

and so driving alone ultimately eliminates these problems because i do not have a distraction or thing that is obstructing my ability to function. it's almost like a learning disability, though it's not about learning, a better word would be functioning disability."
Schizotypal,fe5plyt,t3_eeso2l,1578872659.0,"it would seem that there's a communication gap between those with StPD and typical people / normal people or those who do not have StPD. it isn't so much whether what the person with StPD is saying is right or wrong, but that typical people have difficulty finding a way to reason with ""us"", espicially when it's already hard for us to explain things, that is towards most people. that being, said, i do feel like i communicate things in a reasonable manner, but going past that, i hit a brick wall and it can hard to have people understand why i came up with the conclusion to whatever it is i'm trying to adhere, however, i am not sure if i'm commorbid with schizoaffective disorder ( depressive subtype ), because when i'm not able to be understood and someone else responds back to me as if i'm crazy or doesn't carefully take things i looked into consideration and at the same time, doesn't provide some kind of reasonable answer or support, then i can turn into a very rageful state that can be dangerous not only to myself but others, because i may start verbally assaulting other people uncontrollably and / or physically lash out. this happened with the most recent PCP i saw who i angrily uncontrollably told her off as she was leaving the room, stupid fucking doctor. 

however, it's unclear, whether this is just a communication / interpersonal limitation that creates anger and anxiety based reaction and / or if this would be considered a form of ""psychosis"", since the only reasons i'd agree with having schizoaffective disorder as commorbid to StPD is if this would be a ""symptom"" of it and / or catatonia or tics, although, schizoaffective disorder in specific doesn't mention ""Tics"" as a specific symptom, it is something that what my therapist told me, i seemed to have possibly. i also feel like a lot of people are misdiagnosed with schizotypal PD and instead have another disorder or even no disorder at all. all i can say is that, i haven't related to anyone with schizoaffective disorder and for schizotypal PD, it's a bit unclear to, some things i seem to relate to or can be understood as being the same or similar challenge, but others, not at all. 

sorry if my answer was a bit long, but i hoped it answered your question on what would at least be a delusion."
Schizotypal,fe5l462,t3_eknpjy,1578870845.0,"if you haven't already researched this or know, not all schizotypals are noticabely stereotypically odd or eccentric. there is a specific ""phenotype"" of schizotypals who research ( i believe it was one of those NCBI ones ) listed as not being odd whom can actually appear ""normal"" to be many, which kind be quite annoying when you're actually different from these people, yet they pigeonhole you into the ""normal"" category. it would seem that i would fit this category in that on the outside, i appear to look like most people, however, if people get to know me more or w.e and they aren't stereotypically preassuming things and are ""smart"" enough, will realize that something is ""off"", which most probably know, but the thing is, even if most know, they still treat me like i'm a ""neurotypical"" or ""typical"" person or ""normal"" person, which can be or feel quite insulting and trivializing. i remember this one guy in a mental health group who was like, you're a good kid, but need to stop ""overthinking"" things, and i didn't really have anything to say back to him, but wished i could tell him to fuck off, and no one asked for your opinion, you shallow scumbag. i don't care if you think i'm a ""good kid"" or not, and don't call me a kid, i'm a 20 something year old adult ( which is bad enough ).

now as to your question on dressing oddly, i'm actually not like this at all, so no, i do not relate to it. i actually dress pretty nice and clean and make the effort to do so often because i like to look nice and wear certain clothes to match my personality. However, there are times where i may not care as much and may wear a heavy sweater with just shorts to go out to get groceries or something, because it's quickest and most practical and i don't care so much about looks or whatever here but simply so i can quickly do i what i need to do and go home, but even here, this wouldn't really stand out of the ordinary. what i noticed more annoying is sometimes where i'd wanted to go to family get together or parties, i'd ask in general what would be appropriate and / or maybe i just selected something myself that looked reasonably nice and appropriate, but my parents would then notice a tiny blemish or something and would be overly concerned about being neat or whatever, or if not that, would tell me to change to a different button shirt or whatever, and it would tick me off and often i'd just tell them, we'll, i just want to wear this and i don't see it as a problem and i'd do so, but it's something i never understood. i understand that they are saying to this to me because they are worried about what other people would think ( because they don't want people to view us as ""poor"" or ""low class"" for example ), and i'm not saying i don't care what other people think of me, i do, but in terms of this specific thing, they can say what they wan't, i can hear them out, but at the end, if i feel what they say is unreasonable, then it's just their opinion and i don't need to change just because they say something.

however, what i just noticed immediately right now, ( the poster ""shadow-walk"" hinted it out here ) was that this acting or dressing oddly doesn't really make sense to what research says on what type of people schizotypal PD usually are, because most research shows StPD people as high on conscientiousness or whatever, and with that said, that should make StPD people more self conscious and self aware of themselves or how they appear to others or acting ( something to which is typically weak or non existent in autism related disorders ), yet one of the criteria or at least some groups of people fit this category."
SCT,ez7qved,t1_ez7epvd,1567727197.0,"none of my viewpoints are an indication of being ""small-minded"" or whatever you wan't to impose on me as negative or wrong, but thanks for at least giving me your type, which i was gonna say you were either an INTJ or INTP probably and turns out i was right for INTP."
SCT,ez6ei3n,t1_ez5z0et,1567711520.0,"first of all, you're not helping getting a better understanding to all this by saying my points are black and white...., and even there, you're wrong about me portraying it in a black and white way as it's not, you simply lack the intellect, understanding and thoughtfulness to actually take the time to read and understand my points, second, instead of saying the black and white thing or what not, why don't you actually give some emphasis and detailed experience of why you fit ""SCT"" or some kind of actual experience of your own, instead of just criticizing as you did. and the last part you wrote wasn't helpful either in any shape or form....

also, since i don't think i'll get much of any relatable people or like minded people not only on this thread or elsewhere, the least i can do is at least get your MBTI type if you've tested, since reddit and online forums   
sites are heavily biased with certain MBTI types, you're probably gonna be one of them...."
SCT,ez5q5ey,t3_bu96np,1567702970.0,"reddit and most online forums and sites are heavily biased towards having mostly intuitive types as clearly shown far in this thread and many others, so it's not really a reliable way of getting the true understanding of a specific definition / term or point being talked about, especially in this thread in trying to find a correlation. 

that being said, MOST people who think they have SCT or put themselves in that category do not actually have it, most of course being the intuitive types such as here, and instead, they have ADHD-PI, which IS different from SCT, but not from any of the other ADHD subtypes, in other words, no ADHD subtype is part of SCT, SCT is not ANY ADHD type. they are both distinct and qualitatively different from one another."
mbti,ez5llhv,t3_d02j35,1567701143.0,"this is the stupidest question that keeps getting brought up the same way, and no, Si users are not any physically healthier than other types, and if anything, they are the opposite, many sources and research studies have shown this...., ISFJ in particular are more likely to suffer from cardiovascular problems and one of the highest stress levels...., and this goes along with being more likely to be overweight too, though i don't necessarily need a study to tell me this as my own critical thinking and judgement already knows this, and eating too much / not being as physically active isn't necessarily the only issue as it's more complex than that.

maybe if you assume all mbti types are equal, then your point could be argued as ""valid"", but sadly, it's not, and not all mbti types are created equal, unless you or anyone one else wants to give a counterargument, your welcome to go ahead and try but you'll never be right. if an Si person avoids a food or whatever, it's because they don't like it. do you need a reason to avoid something if you don't like it? jeezes christ..., next question people are gonna say about ISFJ's is that because they have introverted sensing, they must be good at history or more likely to exercise and be fit...., although i find it ironic that they are underrepresented in mental health treatment, because you'd think if everyone was created ""equal"" as i clearly pointed out, then mbti wouldn't affect whether someone seeks mental help or not and so you should see an equal disbursement of types in them, but clearly, this has been shown as not the case from countless sources and places, as well as asking my own psychologist what the majority of her patients were and she told me, yeh...., not really any ISFJ, the most common was intuitive types, p types, or pretty much anyone BUT ISFJ.

and what i mean by seeking mental health help, i'm talking about a one on one situation with a therapist, not mental health groups or support type of groups, but even here, i rarely saw any ISFJ types there, and even if i did meet an ""ISFJ"", i didn't relate to them...., what i did see was PLENTY of the not so common types such as INTJ, INFP, INFJ, and INTP.....

and to your other question to the last paragraph, those other types may eat ""unhealthy"" because they can and it doesn't impose much of an issue for them because it's a trivial problem, and their personalities are stronger and more superior in other areas where it doesn't matter if even they become overweight or what not."
Schizotypal,eyy27u8,t3_cy5o56,1567569015.0,"because this thread question has many different viewpoints / questions, i'll just start out and say that one thing i wanted to get answers and experiences from is people's experience with herbal medicine / supplements that are not psychiatric prescribed ones. i have done my own research on this, and i also looked at many studies from past and present and saved some in particular as they relate to random things, brain biology, mental illnesses and possible treatments for each type, etc. 

however, if im not able to get a large enough comparison with those of actual clinical population such as what i expect to be some here, then i can't draw any better understanding or conclusions to see what kind of medicine would be more likely to be helpful as the next candidate of experimenting. 

my psychologist said she was regularly seeing / possibly still seeing two other schizotypal people and she said although i did have some similarities, the other two were still a lot different than me. one of them didn't take psychiatric medication ( a male ), and the other one was a female who found something helpful for her ""Symptoms"" which was taking both lamictal and abilify, which i thought was very harmful, because one basically tries to make the other medication less brain damaging ( a point i made on my own ). the lamictal makes it so that the abilify is less brain damaging...., but for her of course, it doesn't do that, it ""helps"" her. 

so i wanted to make another point and that is that i did get prescribed anti-psychotics before, and it was the worst thing ever in my existence, like severe torture and brain damage, at even very low dosage. one of them that got prescribed to me sent me to the hospital on the third night as i was laying in bed from it turning in a walking zombie and barely able to move, eat or do anything / sleep, the agitation got so severe and restlessness and brain damage, severe stress, and what not, i started having breathing difficulties and having convulsions and having screaming and crying spells and my brain was jerking back and forth on and off violently. luckily my mom was able to take me to the hospital and i just sat there where they told me the only thing i could do was wait for it to leave my system but in the meantime, they gave me ativan and an anti nausea, and the next 2-3 days, i was pretty fucked up but got back to my ""normal"" state slowly. 

i do not think i'll relate to anyone here on reddit, yet alone anywhere else, but that doesn't stop me from desperately writing out and communicating as time goes. i actually came to reddit because i thought MAYBE sooner down the line, with the effort i put and getting lucky from finding someone of proper relation, i'll able to feel properly aided / supported. the only thing i've gotten mostly 90+ percent is people whom i don't relate to, despite a lot of them saying they relate to me, and i've had this happen a lot in person, and i get disgusted by it because i myself don't actually relate to them at all."
