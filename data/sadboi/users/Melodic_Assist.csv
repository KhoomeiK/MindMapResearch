I spent 2 hours laying in a stranger's apartment (she was homeless and staying in this random place) that had a giant confederate flag on the wall and a Hank William's Jr poster across from it. She put on a Chance the Rapper album and I had very vivid hallucinations of a traumatizing event in my life that had happened a few months earlier. Like, I was reliving what happened in these hallucinations. It was terrifying. I couldn't separate it from reality. I remember the people she was staying with came home and she left and I was convinced these guys were going to rape me, so I drove to my parents house. Luckily they weren't home to see me fucked up out of my mind.

bipolar,fdpou35,t3_emm9pq,1578634996.0,"I need to vent/ramble, so here we go. I'm in the midst of a really bad depressive episode. It's gone on for over a month, possibly longer. I feel so hopeless about my life. I feel like I'm never going to find a job where I will have affordable health insurance. Insurance is kind of necessary when you have a diagnosis like this. Medication is expensive. Therapy is expensive. I can either choose to pay for health insurance or choose to pay my rent, and rent is more important. I also feel like I'm never going to have a job where I can live comfortably. I'm probably always going to make just enough to pay my bills and have maybe $50 left over to do something with. All my friends maybe double or triple what I do and it makes me feel awful. It makes me feel like I'm not worth their time. So much value is placed on your income, and I'm just not enough. I'm worried about what I'm going to do when it comes time to buy a new car or take on any other additional expenses, because every dollar I bring home has an assignment. I literally cannot afford anything else. Trying to pay $200+ a month for a car can't happen because I don't make enough. This is all so stressful to me. I feel like it's never going to get any better. In all honesty, it probably won't because every year, shit just gets more expensive and I'm just going to get poorer. It makes me feel like life isn't worth living because I know this is something that I can't fix. Why bother anymore?"
rapecounseling,fdmexa2,t3_eitdpv,1578547649.0,"Oh, absolutely. I tend to idealize sexual interactions, but when I start to think about actually acting them out, I freak out and get scared. I've sent myself into many a panic attack by doing this. Many of my friends are male, and I've had times where they've gone to hug me to say goodbye or something and I've had a panic attack because of it. It's been about a year and a half since I was assaulted, and recently I had a panic attack because of a friend hugging me. It sucks.

In regards to what you should do: Ideally, you should find a new therapist who specializes in sexual trauma. Go into it knowing that this is the main thing you want to discuss and work on. It's easier said than done, and I know how hard it is to find a good therapist. I've been notoriously known for ghosting therapists because I don't feel comfortable opening up to them about my sexual trauma, so I move on to the next and hope that I'll feel more comfortable with someone new... I never do. It's hard to talk about this stuff to a complete stranger, face to face. It's hard to even talk to a friend about it. Hell, I struggle to talk to my boyfriend about it. We just have to keep moving forward, the best we can.

I can't tell you that it's going to get better and that someday all these problems will go away. As much as I wish I did, I don't have the answer for that. All we can do as survivors is try our best to keep going, keep working on ourselves, and remember that time will help the pain. Sending much love your way."
rapecounseling,fdmec0y,t3_ejnvas,1578547123.0,"Blacking out is terrifying as a sexual assault survivor. After the fact, you feel out of control and you think about all the things that could have possibly happened to you while you were ""gone"". You were safe and with friends who cared, but that doesn't negate the shitty feelings that you're having. You can drink and get drunk and not get to the point of blacking out. Make sure you drink a glass of water with every drink, and if you start to feel too out of control, eat something and take a break. This is something I struggle with, too. I know how you're feeling. At every party I go to, I get scared because I don't want to let myself get too far gone and let something happen to me again. If you ever need to talk, send me a message. Sending lots of love your way. You're strong, you'll get through this."

If I brought any alcohol into the house, my mother would freak out and start yelling. If I got a job more than 5 miles away (mind you, we lived in the country and any job worth having was 15+ miles away), they wouldn't let me take it and I was stuck waiting tables in a local restaurant for years.
