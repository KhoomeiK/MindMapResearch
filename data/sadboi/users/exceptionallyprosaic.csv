My husband has started treating me so much better since I lost weight, and since I repaired my childbirth damaged body.  It has highlighted to me how cold and undemonstrative he was for many years and I think a lot of it had to do with my appearance.  The irony is my husband was obese when we married, although he is also fit now , like me. And we both workout most every day and sometimes together.

Because, from my perspective, it would have been unnecessary, dangerous, and traumatic for him.

He already died alone with no family, but at least he  had the nurses and Drs that he had known for the past years around him when he died. Its not much but it is a small solace for me, that he wasn't transferred to some big hospital and left to die alone. We know at least who was there when he died.

mentalhealth,fnzfy90,t3_g4oucf,1587393310.0,I knew before even reading your post that you are a woman. Weird how that works. I'm sorry this happened to you.
Atlanta,fnzfkgc,t1_fnzea5z,1587393090.0,Maybe there is. Goodness I hope so anyway. Astroturfing with facts instead of propaganda and disinformation
Atlanta,fnzexyw,t1_fnze4ob,1587392734.0,"Well everyone is entitled to their opinion and their feelings, but public health policy that affects every single life in America needs to be based on facts.

These people are ignoring the science, intentionally gathering in large groups unmasked.  They are dangerous not only to themselves but anyone they come in contact.

There are some major things we don't understand about this virus.  It is possible that it's like the herpers virus and there is a possibility that a vaccine will not be effective, in that event, the only way to stop this is through behavioral modification of our culture at large.

Some will be willing to do this and it appears that some, instead will spread death and disease in defiance of all logic."

That's where most of these folks are being targeted."
Atlanta,fnzb6bp,t1_fnz9w0d,1587390474.0,"So back in 2016, during the election, Russian military operatives from overseas used an American man,  Richard Pineda, to obtain the identities of real Americans, by stealing their identities to open real bank accounts to purchase Facebook ads to influence the American presidential election. That really actually happened. Richard Pineda went to jail for it.

They also paid bloggers to write up articles in support of their actions which included inciting people to attend actual protests, and it worked. Those people were manipulated through social engineering tactics.

That all really happened, it is documented in length by the US Dept of Justice. 

The possibility that these protests are just another creation by some group with an agenda  to agitate and influence is pretty likely.

I'm not going to argue the point with you too much, but look up the case of the pro identity thieve Richard Pineda.

I'm not making any claims as to the identities of who is fomenting these current protests, at all. I have no evidence of who is paying to have these websites or bloggers.  

But, these tactics they are using are well known and obvious."
