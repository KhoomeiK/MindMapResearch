He ended up taking things way too far, like way beyond what I was ready for or wanted. I let him because of what he was saying and how he just wouldn't stop pushing, he said he loved me and I loved him, and I thought ""this is what you do with your boyfriend when you love him"". In the moment, I was really nervous and uncomfortable, but I figured that I was just feeling awkward because he was my first serious boyfriend. After that, I felt dirty and sick to my stomach when I was alone with him and I ended up breaking up with him a month later. I was 19 when we dated and ended up being single for four years after that. I didn't know how badly messed me up until I started dating again. I was terrified of being alone with guys and afraid of getting close to them.

centrist,fqbaw57,t3_ghuu7a,1589233647.0,"This doesn't really answer the question, but personally, I feel like health insurance should be run in a similar fashion to car insurance and hospitals should be forced to be fully transparent with their prices. 

In theory, health insurance companies would have to compete with each other and keep their prices low. The consumer would be able to pick and choose their insurance plans as they felt like it. Health insurance would not run through jobs and you'd be able to enroll whenever, not just once a year, so if your current insurance agency was being difficult or charging too much, you could switch to one of their competitors and have plans that fit your budget better.

There could be different packages or you could pick and choose individual things to be covered to create a personalized salad bar of health insurance. And, if you couldn't afford any of the plans, there could be a super basic insurance plan that you can get through the federal government, it might still cost you money to be enrolled in the federal plan, but you'd be charged on a sliding scale and if you had a low enough income, it'd be free. 

In order for this to be beneficial, though, hospitals would need to be fully transparent with how they price and charge services, prices for medical treatment and services need to be heavily regulated in one way or another in order for the prices to not be crazy high, and insurance agencies would need to listen to doctors - so if a doctor says someone needs something that they are paying to be covered (medication, a procedure, ECT), the insurance companies have to comply, they don't get to say no."

POTS,fqa4tea,t3_ghluiv,1589212830.0,"When I started passing out back in December of 2012, I was given an unofficial diagnosis from a pediatric cardiologist who worked in the same hospital as my mom. I was 17 when she said ""you probably have POTS"". At the beginning, it was fairly easy to manage and we didn't pursue anything beyond that. July 31, 2013, I passed out at a basketball tournament I was playing in and everything changed. I started passing out multiple times a day, every day. I was too tired to do anything and so sick that I wasn't myself for months.

We held onto the ""you probably have POTS"" comment that my former doctor had made. I was 18 and unable to be seen by her and when we did get ahold of her and asked her to please help us, she said she couldn't formally diagnose me and we had to start the exhausting fight of finding a doctor to listen to me and to take me seriously.

I was too sick to fight for myself, so my mom was my advocate. She spent days on end researching POTS and she compiled a folder full of articles and notes that she showed doctors. We did not self diagnose, we advocated and educated until we found a specialist who gave me an actual tilt table test, I got my official diagnosis in late 2014. I'm on a slew of medications, I have a heart monitor that I send information to my doctor with monthly, a port that I get saline infusions through, and a team of doctors who know about POTS and who actually help me. It took me several years to get to this point and I had to fight hard, but it was worth it.

Self diagnosis is not good. You know your body, but you don't have the qualifications to diagnose yourself. Besides, Dysautonomia is a beast with many faces, there is always the possibility that you've got something else going on and the symptoms mimic POTS. Keep advocating for yourself, that's always good. But don't try to settle on a self diagnosis. Fight hard for your diagnosis. Your general doc sounds awesome, she isn't just dismissing POTS and she's taking you seriously. She will probably be able to help you find a specialist who can get you an official diagnosis. Once you've got that diagnosis, things slowly start to get easier. The fight is so worth it. Hang in there, you're almost there :)"
AskWomen,fq4y7de,t3_ggnj46,1589087126.0,"If you loose yourself in your relationships, you have codependent tendencies. Fix those first. Learn to be independent. Learn to empower yourself.

My fianc√© and I are very different people. We have many shared interests, but we're still very different. We have different hobbies that are separate from each other and we encourage each other to pursue said hobbies and relish the joy those things bring to us.

When you're in a healthy relationship, you should be thriving as an individual. Your partner will help you shine, and you'll do the same for them. You'll reflect each other's light in your own individual ways. One should never loose themselves in the other."

If POTS occured from a pre-existing condition, it's unlikely that you'll grow out of it. 

There are different ""kinds"" of POTS, and I believe that, depending on which ""kind"" you have, that heavily influences when/if you'll grow out of it.

Anxiety,fp71w3w,t1_fp70mnv,1588362542.0,"Wellbutrin was actually one of the meds that was on the list my therapist gave me and was initially my first choice. But I have issues with tachycardia and Wellbutrin might cause fast heart rate, so I thought it best to avoid that one. Maybe it'll be my fallback if Lexapro doesn't work. Thanks for sharing your experience"

centrist,fp40r5l,t3_gb6i51,1588289430.0,"I think that at the end of May, we need to transition into a social distancing phase what would have at risk individuals continuing to self isolate while things reopen and everyone else is able to, if they feel safe to do so, go back to work and be out and about again. Limit gatherings to under 100 and encourage/require masks to be worn until possibly September/October, at which point at risk individuals can come out of self isolation, gatherings can be limited to under 250, masks would still be recommended/enforced. Continue on like that until December/January and then after that let everything be business as usual. Until things are safe, workers should be able to continue to have UI benefits (maybe limit the pay to national minimum wage or give them 1/3 or 1/4 of their usual pay) if they're at risk and don't want to go back to work until there's a vaccine. That's just my opinion, though."
