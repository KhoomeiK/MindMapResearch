questioning,er8j9ej,t3_c0rs1e,1560605708.0,"I get you when you talk about masculine energy. It’s the same for me.

Some months ago I’ve met an old friend from eighth grade. He’s grown into a very good looking guy and when I saw him I thought: “Why can’t I grow up the same way as him?”.

There’s this girl I’ve liked since when I’ve first seen her and I wish I could like her as a boy. Maybe it’s because she’s straight, but it’s not just that. I can tell that my feeling is deeper.

The doubts will keep coming. You know why? This is a huge step. I’m turning eighteen next May and I will try to have access to HRT. I’m already scared as fuck. I’m nonbinary. I don’t want to quit my female appearance, but I can’t live being perceived as “she”. My body doesn’t represent me and I want to live my life to the fullest, so I’m doing it. I’m trying to see how I react to Testosterone. Though this whole situation is scary as much as it’s freeing.
I want my body to match my identity. It never had, since childhood. (Know that having feelings like this since childhood is not a requirement, however, this is just me). I want things to change, for me.

Writing out your feelings and thoughts can help a lot. You can discover so much about yourself this way.

You say you would miss some aspects of “femininity”.
Chella Man, a deaf queer artist and activist, in his TED Talk “Becoming Him” said this line: “[Talking about when his mother would ask him whether he wanted to be a boy or a girl] I believe that by saying *boy* I would be forced to leave most of my feminine traits behind, some of them that I did connect with; however there were so many characteristics associated with *boy* that I did connect to. So how was I supposed to choose one or the other without losing pieces of myself in the process?”. (https://youtu.be/M6vgidU8S3E)
Maybe this resonates with you someway.
He identifies as genderqueer. This doesn’t necessarily mean that if you relate to his experience, you automatically are genderqueer too.

However, I do suggest you to look into NB options. Even just for curiosity and knowledge. It’s a great thing to do to support other trans folks, even if you turn out to be binary.

When I was told this, when I was in the same place as you, I would react like: “The fuck I’m non-binary!”. I would actually be quite offended by it.
This was because I felt less of a man, identifying as NB. I then gradually accepted the label “demi-boy” as an identification for myself, understanding that being a nonbinary man doesn’t make one any less of a man than a binary man. I then dropped this label as well and now I just call myself queer, both in terms of gender and sexuality.

So know that if you feel uncomfortable imagining yourself as nonbinary there could be many reasons, look into it deeply. Look into any of this stuff deeply.
I believe that to understand our own gender identity the most important question is “*WHY*?”. Why do I feel this way? I *don’t* I feel this other way?"
depression,er8ejgk,t1_er8apfv,1560602856.0,"I’m very happy to hear this. If you want to talk about anything, doesn’t necessarily have to be deep, big stuff like this, I’ll be glad to sort our worries out together.

I’m always worried to convey wrong messages because when I was deep into depression and felt terribly I would interpret negative stuff anywhere and I’m worried that others will too with what I say.
So I’m so very happy that I helped you with this.

For example, when others told me: “You are not the only one”. My ill mind would go like: “Other people are like me and they can endure it. I can’t. I’m awful”.

However, I also wanted to tell you that if you can’t have access to therapy, it doesn’t mean that you can’t heal. So even if your situation is this one, don’t despair. Try to trust me.

My experience with therapy is not the best either. Meds are what played a key role and also the fact of being effectively diagnosed with depression helped, even if I still struggle with imposter syndrome. But therapy itself, meaning the talking with the various psycho-folks I’ve seen, has most times made me feel sensibly worse. Meds gave me the strength to model my own way of thinking myself and life. This doesn’t want to be an apology to medication, however, it’s just my experience. Meds don’t even work for everybody.

However, since you are queer, once you’ll be more confident about what your gender identity is like you will feel so good that all the struggle will be worth it, I promise you.
Knowing that I’m queer improved my quality of life sensibly."
depression,er7yclk,t3_bys1a5,1560591156.0,"I’m seventeen now and was in your same situation when I was in middle school.
Time is your ally. With time the pain you are feeling will become less and less intense, I promise you.
I was absolutely lost. I had no idea who I was. I would describe myself as “shy”, “thoughtful” one day and “easy-going”, “hot-headed” the other. I would write pages about myself and then trash them in sheer discomfort for how I loathed everything and could find nothing genuine.
I can’t tell you precisely how I found myself, because it’s not clear to me either.
My path is probably a particular one as well, since gender identity played a big part in my discomfort, but at the same time it’s not different at all.
The only thing I can assure you is that through time things will figure out. I know this is not going to make you feel any better, but try to trust me.

Actually, not knowing who you are is completely fine. I would suggest you to give yourself some rest from these thoughts that I know are severely painful. The unknown can be enjoyed too.
A change of perspective is often a miraculous tool. For example try to not think that you “are nothing”, but, since you are not something defined now, that you have the potential of being absolutely anything. You might say “yea but I have no idea what to become”, that’s secondary. This is something that will come with time. Aging is miraculous.

You could also try to build yourself little by little. Think about one thing you like and would like to be some kind of expert in. It can be dunno majokko anime series, to give an example, and you could take some time everyday to deepen your knowledge into that thing you enjoy. Just watching new series and, doing so, building a critical eye.
It can be anything, really.
For me now it’s photography. Before it was anime.

It’s okay to emulate others, it’s a way to experiment. It’s not bad. As it’s not bad not to have a clear identity yet. It’s a painful stage of life.
Experiment with yourself. Experiment with clothes, with hobbies, with sexuality, with religion... Try to think of yourself in a way for some time and see how it feels, then change way to see how *that* feels and so on. It’s not bad, indeed is something mature.

Identity is all about who you want to become.

Knowing who you want to become is a process.
You were not born with the answer to this.
Through experimentation you will find it.

An important thing is: be kind with yourself.
Practice a positive selftalk.
It’s okay to fail, it’s okay to feel bad, it’s okay to be confused, it’s okay to be scared, it’s okay to decline.
It’s okay to be coward. It’s okay to decide to give up sometimes. It’s okay to leave.
As long as other people don’t pay the expenses for you actions. But also know that other people’s happiness is not upon you. Some choices we make hurt others and it’s okay, it’s how life is. Prioritize your mental health.

I used to selfharm on a daily basis. Talk to a professionist. This is a key point. If your parents are not trustworthy, go to a trusted teacher. Don’t worry, teachers are glad when they can help us. They’ll do anything in their power.
I still selharm sometimes because I get overwhelmed. I don’t know any better coping method, so I can’t help you on that.

I don’t know you, but I believe in you because I know your struggle.

Stay safe

EDIT: Uh, I saw you have problems with gender identity like me too. (Went through your post history). Experimenting is a big thing with that as well. For me it was incredibly tough to accept to be nonbinary, because I didn’t want to give up being a boy/man. I now know that not being binary doesn’t make me any less of a man. I’m just a something else too and a man who craves for being able to pass as both binary genders and also as none.
Gender is amazing, once you find what’s good for you. Unluckily the process to be there is absolutely painful. I had to educate my psychiatrist about this. She also has real difficulties understanding how a guy would ever want to put on a skirt, but she’s accepting. We live in a world which is not ideal for people who are not cisgender and for people who don’t fit a binary. You know how you can keep afloat in this? Find positive online communities. It’s for this reason that I am on Reddit.

She will lose many of her friends? Well, she had to think about the possible scenarios *before* putting up all this. It’s not your fault if things turned out badly for her, she put herself into a scam that was very likely to end badly, since what she has done is straight up illicit.

If you didn’t delete everything before confronting her, she could have repeated the thing lying about having trashed all the photos. So I wouldn’t fault you for this... Same thing goes for making it clear with her friends that your sister is a different person than the one they think. They now know and this way it’s safer.

I’ve lost wonderful presences in my life and was deeply sad when they had to go. But then I did find other wonderful people. I never knew that so many good people exist on this planet, really...
Your so-called friends disinterest means nothing. Don’t overthink it! It doesn’t mean that you are not worthy of love, that you are unpleasant to be with or anything. It only means you haven’t found people who love you for who you are. And, believe me, it takes a pretty long time for lots of people, me included.
This doesn’t help loneliness, probably, but know that those negative thoughts are purely irrational. *Know* it, for real.

I’m with you with stress from exams and difficulties to keep up and with depression. Depression transformed me into a whole other person, someone who struggles to do anything. Studying is hard with depression. It’s not laziness, it’s not lack of intelligence/ability. It’s poor mental health.

Girl fat-shaming family is the worst. Mine is like that as well and I’ve never even been overweight 🤷🏻‍♀️ Though they constantly laugh at a female cousin of my mother who is fat to a point that her health is paying for it, which is obviously bad, but in this case a human is meant to express sincere worry, not “DUH PIGGY!!”.
However you look just nice to me, we don’t need to be all thin 😩 Remind you just in case your family blabbering sometimes gets to you, which would be more than understandable.
I used to selfharm. My mother says my scars are ugly and told me that we can go and erase them (apparently it’s possible, I guess it’s some kind of cosmetic surgery?), but they are a part of me and I would never do it. Though I do love my body, they make everything harder.
They are not bad people, just very conditioned by society standards of beauty. They are not even the most empathetic ones, but they are only humans after all. Understanding this let me live my family situation better. Maybe it can help you too..."

There are no specific terms that fit me either, but I know that I am not straight and not cisgender, so I just go by queer because any further specification doesn’t make me feel good.

Second thing. The answer to the question: “What’s my sexuality?” can’t come from the outside, no one can tell you “you are bi”, “you are straight”, it’s all on you. The answer comes from the inside and you are the only one who can know it, because you are the only one who sees the full picture.
Sexuality is all about how you feel and how you live yourself.

The fact of being attracted to male genitalia itself doesn’t mean anything.
You said you are a guy who is attracted to women and also is quite attracted in males by genitalia and genitalia only.
This is fine with me.
You don’t *need* to give a name to it. Don’t perceive labeling you sexuality as a necessity, ‘cause it isn’t.
Know that sexuality is very fluid. It’s not just you are rather attracted to men or attracted to women, romantically attracted to both or to neither, it’s not this strict at all. Some people do have very distinct feelings and are just 100% gay, bi or straight. But there are many many cases where it’s way more fluid."
