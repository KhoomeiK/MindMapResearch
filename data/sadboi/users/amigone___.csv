beyondthebump,fqu1tdm,t3_gku04f,1589650376.0,"Fuck spanking 

Fuck yelling and screaming 

Fuck anyone who defends that abusive bullshit

I grew up in a household where that shit was ""normal"", because that's how my parents were raised so it was ""normal"" for them. I lived in fear. I learned to be good at lying. I didn't like my parents for a long time. I rarely confided in them because it would just result in screaming. I just dealt with them and I never want my kid to feel that way. 

The only thing I need to help me break the cycle of spanking / screaming aka abuse is reminding myself how much that emotionally fucked me up, and how it still fucks with me today. As an adult I have weekly flashbacks about being screamed at, name called, threatened, and a fear that I would be hit.

breakingmom,fqqwh72,t3_gk540k,1589573210.0,"I feel like your mother is being very malicious. I think she knows that she is important to you, she knows that ignoring you will upset you, and is using her power to punish and torture you for doing something she doesn't approve of. 

You are a 31 year old woman who got a cat for fucks sake and she's acting like you burnt down her house in a cocaine induced frenzy. 

My advice to you is to stop trying to contact her. When you keep contacting her it gives her another opportunity to exercise her power by not answering. 

You made an effort to be an adult and speak to her. Its her job now to get over herself. 

I'm sorry if this came off as harsh. My heart goes out to you but your mom is being intentionally vindictive and I think that's so nasty. Occupy yourself with hobbies, shows, and distractions from this. 

I also have a baby, 3 dogs, and a bird. I have a cleaning schedule and that helps me keep the house very tidy."

I get out of my PJs, make my hair nice, wash my face each morning. 

Drink my coffee outside, feed the baby outside 

Start a project, even if you can only do a little bit of it each day. My project is updating my backyard. 

Go for a walk with the baby 

It's not a lot but it helps me when I'm feeling bananas, especially getting out in the sun."
breakingmom,fqbwk9p,t3_ghzr3r,1589245334.0,"Streamer here! Here's some insight for you:

I can say with absolute confidence that he will not be making as much as you, matter of fact he won't even come close to that. 

The streaming world is completely saturated. It is very hard to get anywhere, nevertheless make money that actually isn't a joke. 

I was a teacher for 4 years and I streamed as a hobby on the side. I made money doing my hobby so that's pretty rad. I have recently gone full time streaming because I am staying home with our baby and my husband makes enough to support us. I am currently going back to school so once the baby is ready for school I can go back to work, because God forbid something happens to my husband, I need a job i like to support my child, because streaming ain't it.

At my peak year in streaming I made a little more than 10k. Now, a very important thing to remember is that part of what i stream is artwork, so a big chunk of that money was from comissions and selling paintings. 

The other years when I was teaching and hobby streaming I made close to 10k, sometimes close to 5k. It's inconsistent, and it's inconsistency reflects the ecosystem of the ""job"" itself. 

My advice: 

If he's going in it because he thinks he's going to make bank then he is very misguided, and he's going to get very discouraged VERY fast. 

Like my situation, If he wants to do streaming as a ""job"" when he is at home legitimately tending to the house/children then I say go for it. I do house/baby stuff during the day and I stream at night when she's sleeping. 

Hope this helps!

**Edit Oh and you mention that he gives up if it is a ton of work. I grind my ASS off to make what I make doing that. It is not easy at all. It's a huge hustle."
