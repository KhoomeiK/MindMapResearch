depression,fpj8lwj,t1_fpfi06q,1588659903.0,I think I get you. It's more like living because you have to and that's just how your body works.
depression,fpfh5xk,t3_gd5kku,1588571111.0,"Imagine there's nothing after death. It's not happy nor sad. Nothing. Now is the time to experience anything. You'll end up dead anyway, so why speeding up the process?"

depression,foj0znv,t3_g7ioys,1587804091.0,Tbh that kind of people always scare me. They seem to be so fake I want to get away from them instantly.
Anxiety,fkuzlwc,t1_fkuizae,1584559123.0,Thank you for this.
Polska,f7ak6rw,t1_f6z6mi5,1573531390.0,"Też starałam się czytać i zbierać regularnie, ale zaczęłam interesować się kwartalnikiem architektonicznym ""Rzut"" (polecam, mimo, że osobiście z architekturą nie mam nic wspólnego), a do tego doszło parę książek czytanych jednocześnie. Efekt jest taki, że w czasie podróży wyciągam z torby zimowy ""Przekrój"" z zeszłego roku, podczas gdy najnowszy numer leżakuje na półce w domu i czeka na swoją kolej."

aww,f1nutgp,t3_d9z9as,1569626946.0,He's adorable. Why is he blind though? Did something happen or he was just born with it?

That's so harsh and mean of your mother. I think you should report this somewhere, it's not a normal behaviour."
quittingsmoking,ewgegwu,t3_co1mch,1565380026.0,""" I don’t know if part of it is that I just really hate being sober. ""

This is so relatable to me. Thinking about adrenaline or that nice feeling of being unsober is my daily struggle.  It's so easy to smoke or drink or whatever to get the desired effect, and it's so much more demanding to achieve it naturally by working out or by doing something creative and productive."
LetsNotMeet,etz4mpp,t1_etz3kyc,1563326866.0,Good to hear that. I hope he would stay there for a long time.

I'm happy he didn't manage to do anything worse to her or his other victims. Do you know what happened to the guy after they caught him?"
SeriousConversation,etvnmfu,t1_etugbid,1563240048.0,I agree with you. OP's roommate seems not to have any good conversation method about the issue without being passive-aggressive on him. It would result in the opposite direction and would not encourage him to be more engaged in that matter.
AskReddit,etvivlc,t1_etvfzfd,1563236559.0,"I feel you. Sometimes I'm having  nightmares about school too, but it's such a pleasure and relief when I wake up and realize it was just a stupid dream."
AskReddit,etvi66n,t3_cdpdfv,1563236038.0,"Arrogance seems to me as a lack of knowledge of a person while being pretentious and proud at the same time. I would say arrogance and ignorance are very much alike.

Confidence would be an awareness of one's limitations and advantages. It's way more balanced and judicious."

TooAfraidToAsk,es5leo5,t3_c614vr,1561616471.0,"I've heard a story about a girl who was eating her lunch while she started to choke at some point. Despite her being near death, she didn't want to call for help because it was too embarrassing for her. Fortunately she managed to deal with it on her own.

That being said, dying or being in a dangerous situation might cause embarrassment, even if it's irrational."
