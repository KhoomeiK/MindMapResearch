I applied April 17th and they are saying I need to call them but when I call they say they can't answer my phone BUT also that I wont be penalized for not calling them, since it said to reach out on the website.

People on here are saying call right at 7am so I will try that tomorrow.

This process is very disheartening."

**90s rap:**

* gza - liquid swords (classic but not sure if youve heard of it)

* raekwon - only built 4 cuban linx (same as above, one of my favorites)

* ghostface killah - 36 seasons (less classic, still good)

* benny the butcher - plugs i met (not 90s but it has the same sound and feel)

**modern rap:**

* kanye - yeezus (i love this man so i had to include him)

* freddie gibbs - pinata (great great rap album)

* maxo kream - the persona tape (more hardcore rap)

* mac miller - faces (the best mixtape ive ever heard, rip mac)

* playboi carti - die lit (holy moly do i love this album)

* young dolph - thinking out loud (another harder rap album)




**other music: (random genres and stuff)**

* big thief - masterpiece (great lowfi indie album)

* ２８１４ - 新しい日の誕生 (terrific vaporwave album, one of the best ive heard)

* sufjan stevens - carrie and lowell (sad sad music)

* alvvays - antisocialites (another great indie album)

* all girl summer fun band - summer of 98 (one of my most favorite albums ever)
