bipolar2,fqggus0,t1_fqg1o4d,1589345930.0,It changed my life too. I never thought I would feel “normal” again but I have long periods of normal since I started taking lamictal
whatsthisplant,focwfgk,t1_foclljt,1587676774.0,Thank you! That makes me feel better that I’m not killing him! 😅
whatsthisplant,focdtcd,t1_foc19rs,1587670144.0,Thank you! I posted on that group too so we’ll see what they say. I appreciate your help!
whatsthisplant,fobuctk,t3_g6r58g,1587663755.0,"Please help me to identify what kind of plant this is. I’m thinking it’s a climbing aloe but not sure! Also, I’m really worried because he’s starting to turn brown. I recently repotted him because he was outgrowing his old container and also recently moved him to my window (sunburn)? How can I revive him? He’s my oldest plant and I’m worried 😢"

bipolar2,fngb37n,t1_fnga35s,1586926960.0,I can understand that too. I think it can be difficult for people who care about us when they can’t make us feel better. It seems like you’re doing the right thing by telling your loved ones the facts and I think it’s fine that you don’t talk about it if it’s not helpful for you!
bipolar2,fnganm5,t3_g0t8i9,1586926619.0,I actually didn’t realize you can track multiple times/day but that’s really helpful because I tend to feel worst at night so maybe I can get a more accurate view now. I like the “tally” graph better too!
bipolar2,fng9z71,t3_g1jv85,1586926086.0,My husband got a little triggered watching him because he said that’s how I get (to a lesser extreme) sometimes 😕
bipolar2,fng9tr4,t3_g1l0b8,1586925969.0,"I have a really hard time talking about it to anyone, even my husband sometimes. I’ve been diagnosed for 12 years and it’s still difficult and I feel ashamed even though I shouldn’t."
bipolar2,fmv6bvs,t1_fmsbjax,1586407241.0,Meditation is a game changer! I like the Calm app but heard headspace is good too. My anxiety is still severe but the breathing exercises I’ve learned through meditation can help me not to spiral when I feel it coming on
bipolar2,fmv5xhp,t3_fxfaaa,1586406936.0,Lamictal literally saved my life. It’s pretty magical. I do feel like it makes me kind of spacey but that’s better than having racing thoughts
bipolar2,fmv5owy,t3_fxh0qp,1586406761.0,Here’s your second hug from Wisconsin! ☺️ Sending my sympathy and good thoughts your way. I’m happy to hear that you’re stable. You’re strong enough to get through this difficult time!
bipolar2,eyxg0sc,t3_cz7urb,1567552408.0,🙋🏼‍♀️ I feel the same way with not deserving my job and the worry that everyone will someday realize it. It’s especially bad right now because I just got promoted and don’t feel like an expert in my new role. I also get extreme social anxiety about random meetings and sometimes move meetings to avoid the uncomfortable feeling 😔
bipolar,eyf4voz,t3_cwnted,1567043468.0,It just gives me text anxiety 😂
bipolar2,ey9qj67,t1_ey9dgbz,1566949948.0,That helps a lot! I think when I lean into it I do fuel it so I have to figure out a better balance. Thank you 😊
bipolar2,ey8aeqf,t1_ey8aajl,1566915427.0,Thank you. It’s very helpful to hear from someone who understands. I’m between therapists at the moment and it’s difficult to explain to friends who don’t experience it themselves
