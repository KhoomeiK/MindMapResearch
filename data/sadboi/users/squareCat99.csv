EatingDisorders,fnr7jtx,t3_g37jr4,1587181246.0,"I'm in a program that has both PHP and IOP virtual (I'm in IOP).  We do groups virtually, and meals virtually as well.  We go in once a week for weights and vitals, and to pick up food boxes.   It was weird to get used to in the beginning, but I'm actually still getting a lot out of it now.  I'm lucky that all the people in the group are really committed to participating virtually, and I do feel connected and supported by everyone - we've talked about how crazy it is that some of us have never met in person but still feel so close.  Meals are a little weird.  We have to prep them ahead of time and have 15 minutes to get them ready and plate, then we eat together on camera.   Observation and behavior compliance obviously aren't the same since they can't be watching you, but honestly, it's not that different than PHP or IOP since there's a significant amount of time you're not in program anyway.   It's great for me since being at home was really my most challenging time anyway, and they're really focused on supporting that since everyone is at home now."
EatingDisorders,fmooocc,t1_fmjlvjm,1586265039.0,"Every person's time frame is different and can depend on a ton of things, particularly a consistent flow of food.   I would definitely follow up with your doc and push for more investigation, though - what you're describing sounds really uncomfortable and you'll want to rule out any medical conditions that could be causing it."
EatingDisorders,fmhuazo,t3_fvdfug,1586093723.0,"I would definitely see a medical professional to check for underlying medical conditions, but yes, what you're describing is very similar to my situation and I was officially diagnosed with bulimia.  I'm a generally normal appearing weight, and had the same sensations - extreme fullness, stomach pain and nausea when I ate, that would come and go.   I went into eating disorder treatment and discovered I had definitely damaged my metabolism and my body had become so accustomed to purging that any food sitting in my stomach was basically causing me to feel over full and sick.   Once I started eating a regular, consistent meal plan, most of those feelings went away."
EatingDisorders,fltwq1j,t3_fr4nw7,1585489471.0,"I always try and use various techniques to distract, etc when I'm feeling antsy like that.  You can try reading, journaling, drawing/painting.   Activities like coloring, puzzles, origami, or knitting can help keep you distracted.   Craft projects are great and you can order them online.  You can ask your sister to play board games, or even things like putty or stress balls can help if you don't want to talk to other people."
Concussion,fjyl7lw,t1_fjxvk6k,1583699142.0,"Yep, in the US it’s a physical therapist but I think it’s the same thing.  Ask for someone with specialization in concussions and vestibular therapy in particular."
Concussion,fjxlg9h,t3_ffa8p6,1583677116.0,"I had this issue as well.  I needed quite a bit of vestibular therapy to isolate the cause of the wobbliness and re-acclimate my brain.  I would see a physical therapist and get assessed - if you need PT and wait, it can take longer in the end as your brain will start to try and acclimate incorrectly.  this is from someone who waited for several months, and definitely shouldn't have.   :("

Concussion,fha2hu3,t3_f22woc,1581395432.0,"I’m on year 5, so I can’t say it’s all going away tomorrow.  That being said, I’ve hit my head twice in the last year and have recovered relatively quickly.  I’ve finished vestibular therapy and my balance is back to normal, and I’ve moved on to vision therapy to start to address the last remaining dizziness and nausea.  The key is finding good PT folks who can help you assess what exactly is happening and what type of treatment you need!"
Concussion,ew38tww,t3_ckdgi4,1565068155.0,"Obviously check with your doc if meds would help.   I made a ton of environmental adjustments - lowered screen brightness, turned off overhead lights and used a sunlight lamp, screen filtering glasses, earplugs and ball cap to help reduce visual noise if necessary (not all at the same time, just as needed).  Also, making sure you get sleep, stay hydrated, and have snacks - lack of water or food can lower your tolerance.  Also, take short breaks if needed - I’d lie down in my car with an eye mask for 10- 15 minutes when it got really bad.   Having a set of coping tools handy can help it be less stressful!"
Concussion,ew38csu,t3_cki4xu,1565067659.0,"I lost almost 15 lbs after my concussion due to the constant dizziness and nausea which killed my appetite.  Once those symptoms started to subside, I gained it all back and then some once I started being able to eat again.   I just did normal food tracking and exercise and eventually came back down, but it took a while as my metabolism was a bit messed up from not eating enough for so long."
