When I was much younger and had little grasp on what mental health was, I made a post about my  dissasociation, not knowing what it was at the time. Around then, I was experiencing the worst bout of it I've ever had and was looking for any sort of advice. Some nut told me all about this strange occult shit that I got really in to at the time. The problem is, what I was doing was reinforcing this feeling of dissasociation until it basically became part of me for a long while. I got out of it years later and managed to start to control how I felt a bit more and am getting better.

I worked really really hard to make changes to how I was originally made to think and act around these groups and have made massive strides towards being an actual person rather than being a person filled with hate and negativity to all those different than me.

It's helped me learn a lot about it and slowly becoming comfortable with my own bisexuality in the process, but I still have a while to go for that.
