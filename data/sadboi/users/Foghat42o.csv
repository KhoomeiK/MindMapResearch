Omniscient- meaning he knows everything.

He has the power to take away pain and suffering. And for some reason, unbeknownst to me, he decides not to intervene in atrocities that happen every day. So, yeah it kind of seems like he's a moody genie to me. Comparable to a kid with a magnifying glass on an ant hill torturing ants for fun.

Richard Dawkins explains 2 definition of the word theory.

""Theory, sense 1: A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phemomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed. 

Theory, Sense 2: A hypothesis proposed as an explanation hence, a mere hypothesis, speculation, conjecture; an idea or onset of ideas about something; an individual view or notion."" 

Dawkins goes on to say that scientists use sense 1 regarding evolution and that creationists opt for sense 2. 

"" Scientist and creationists are understanding the word 'theory' in two very different senses. *Evolution* is a theory in the same sense as the heliocentric theory. In neither case should the word 'only' be used, as in 'only a theory'."""

This is the same feeling I have towards all religion. The acronym for fear is:

False
Evidence
Appearing 
Real

I think that people worship the god of their choice to make them feel comfortable about life having an actual meaning to it. Perhaps it does, perhaps it doesn't. If you read the bible from beginning to end, it is scary. Genesis and Exodus alone is enough to freak anyone out if they believe in the god from the bible. The bible also has miracles happening all through out it. They chalk it up to ""it wasn't meant to be"" or ""god has a plan"" and then good things will stop happening to them or that their prayers will go unanswered. In other words, it gives them a purpose in life (even if it is false). It acts as a safety blanket that helps them cope."
