I also loved working from home, but  in my state we were allowed to go back to work in our office last week. so I'm back in the office and I hate it! ugh, my co workers are so annoying and its so pointless, like why should I drive to the office to sit at the computer all day when I could do the same exact thing at home? 

I've also lost weight because I can keep track of what I'm eating so much better when I'm not at a restaurant or bar. I might just become a hermit permanently lol.

but I also realize I am extremely lucky that I have a full time job that doesn't involve dealing with the public, I have a great partner who I live with and get to be with every day, my financial situation was very good before this pandemic, and I am an introvert so I actually like not interacting with people. so a lot of it does have to do with circumstance and personality..."

This time, I decided to take it slow. I started walking on the weekends for 30 minutes. Then I started walking every day. This went on for about 3 months, and I didn’t lose any weight but I felt so much better about myself! And I was taking a lot better care of myself too. Showering more, cleaning my house, etc. I felt so much better mentally. 

for the past 3 weeks I’ve been really focusing on my eating habits, I haven’t cut out any “bad” food, I’m just eating LESS of the food I usually eat (this has made “dieting” seem like less of a chore). I have a real problem with binging food when I’m depressed so this is probably the biggest challenge for me. Controlling my portions.

I stepped on the scale yesterday and I saw that I’ve lost 2 lbs since last week! This was huge for me since I haven’t lost weight for like 2 years. Finally something is working and it isn’t even that hard! Just moving more and eating less. 

My advice is take it slow and be super kind to yourself. Just try to go for a 10 minute walk on a day you have the time and energy (I bet you’ll want to keep walking for longer once you start). Try to find things that you enjoy doing that help you get active. Don’t force yourself to do things you don’t like. I’ve gotten a lot of good advice and support from r/loseit. You got this!

My fiancé has cirrhosis from drinking and cannot ever drink again. He was only 26 when he was diagnosed. The thing that helped him the most in getting and staying sober was having a strong support system. People that he knew would never leave him even if things got really hard. He never went to AA or any other support group, but I think he could have benefited from it. 

He was also prescribed antidepressants by his doctor, and the doc also highly encourages him to see a therapist. I think he should have started seeing a therapist as soon as he was diagnosed, I think it could have helped a lot. (but I’m not really one to talk since I haven’t seen a therapist in years and I am diagnosed with depression)

My fiancé is soooo much happier and healthier now that he has been sober for 3 years. He tells me all the time he is so much better off. Of course it was really hard at first, he lost a lot of “friends” (drinking buddies). But now our life has stabilized again and things are really good. There is a light at the end of the tunnel!

I'd say the hardest thing about the major is time commitment and time management. you'll find yourself in studio sometimes when your friends are out doing fun things, but you have to just make sure you discipline yourself to get your shit done and THEN go out and party. you'll enjoy it 10x more, too. its important to balance fun and studying in any major, but especially in architecture. I had fun working in studio too, its different than studying or writing. much more rewarding. the second hardest thing, for me at least, was presenting projects to my professors. I would get so nervous my hands would sweat and shake the entire time I was up there. I had to really train myself to be comfortable talking in front of people.

If you wish to become a licensed architect (if you are in the United States), its important that you get your degree from an accredited university.  many bachelor degrees are not accredited by NCARB, so most people also get their master's degree and not just a bachelor degree. This is another reason its important to be passionate, you are going to be in school for a long time. and then after school you usually intern for 3-4 years before you can take your licensing exams (ARE). but don't worry you will be paid! I believe AIA made it illegal for architects to not pay their interns. I'm technically an ""intern"" but I have a decent salary and I get paid overtime too.  I love my job, but like any job some days drag on. other days fly by and I wish I could stay at work longer lol.

when my fiance found out he had cirrhosis and that he could never drink alcohol again, we went through a tough adjustment time too (not nearly as complicated as your situation, I realize). all our social and work circles revolved around drinking so we were kind of ""forced"" to make new friends that didn't mind if we weren't into the drinking scene. family and friends felt awkward around him for a time and it kind of felt like it was just him and I against the world.

AskReddit,fhp3qh9,t1_fhp2a59,1581781278.0,Yeah that’s cool if you have a washer and dryer. I have to go to the laundromat.
AskReddit,fhp15ox,t1_fhoutug,1581779844.0,"Yeah when I was single it was like this, now I have twice as many clothes to wash, dry, and put away! It takes all damn day."
depression,fhp0l7h,t1_fhoy2pr,1581779519.0,"That’s strange to me, my GP encouraged me to get on birth control to stabilize my moods during pms. I don’t have painful periods, but my mood swings are CRAZY the week before and the week of my period. My depression tends to get much worse. I think the birth control has helped a bit, along with antidepressants. I still get depressed the week before my period though. At least I know it’s just because of my hormones."
depression,fhozg20,t3_f47fxo,1581778653.0,I’ve been taking citalopram for years and I drink fairly regularly. Never been an issue. The only side affect I noticed from it is low sex drive.
AskReddit,fhkolyn,t3_f3l9kd,1581688254.0,"Deorr Kunz. I live in Idaho and this toddler went missing in southern Idaho in the middle of nowhere. It doesn’t make any sense. If interested, I recommend true crime garage’s podcast episode on the case to learn more. It’s very frustrating for me, I think the mom knows exactly where he is..."
AskReddit,fhiedo6,t1_fhibtz4,1581623107.0,This is what I do. $100/month budgeted for my savings account. And it’s automatically withdrawn from my checking account each month on the 1st. So I don’t even have to think about it.
AskReddit,fhhc0uf,t1_fhh9xed,1581600417.0,"I lived on a sailboat for a year and half in the Caribbean when I was 11-13. We sailed from Florida to Grenada and then back to Florida. It’s not nearly as glamorous as it sounds, but it was certainly eye opening. Because I was a pre teen I was mad at my parents for taking me from all I knew and loved and I didn’t want to be there. But looking back, it was a great experience. I especially liked the Dominican Republic and Grenada. Maybe because we spent a significant amount of time there waiting for good weather (the weather rules all when you live on a boat lol). If you want to know more feel free to ask any questions. I enjoy taking about my trip and sharing the experiences. We learned A LOT obviously and like to give advice too. My parents are currently living on a catamaran in key west for the winter. Next year they want to go to the Bahamas. It’s a different sort of life, but with all the technology now it’s a lot easier to adapt to than it was when I went."
relationship_advice,fhg7y42,t3_f308fl,1581560648.0,"My only real friend is me. Myself. That is the only person I can truly count on. I’ve learned you can’t make people like you, and you can’t make yourself like other people either. IMO, having lots of friends is overrated. Having a few very close friends is ideal. I have like 3 people total who I would consider true friends, and one of those people is my fiancé. But I still know they could decide at any time to leave me behind. That’s why I have to remember to nurture the friendship I have myself too."
depression,fhg7j70,t3_f32ggs,1581560374.0,"All my “happy” times always seem to have a feeling of bittersweet sadness to them. Like I couldn’t even let myself be happy when I should have been. I always had a feeling of sadness, even if it has felt farther away at certain times. If that makes sense."
AskReddit,fhg4o3w,t1_fhfe7sf,1581558510.0,Me too. But for some reason I can’t do this irl with ppl I care about :( it hurts all my relationships.
relationship_advice,fhg2ih4,t3_f2wgda,1581557073.0,"make a card! if you have the time. I've found people LOVE homemade cards more than regular gifts. especially family members. I used to make them by hand, but now I often use photoshop to make my own digitally and send them via email since a lot of my family and friends are travelers. anyway, I think a card with a meaningful message/note would make your mom really happy. she'll probably be touched you even remembered!"
Revit,fhg1n19,t3_f31kke,1581556479.0,"if you're only interested in the renders/VR, then you can just use sketch up.  if the firm you're working with is using a Revit, you can import a Revit models into sketch up pro. idk how compatible archiCAD or any of the others are with sketch up, I have only ever imported Revit models into sketch up. 

As was mentioned, Revit's strength is in BIM and documentation, not rendering."
loseit,fhe5gjy,t1_fhe4epb,1581514238.0,"I’m also a major perfectionist! It’s a trait that has helped me succeed in a lot of ways, but my intense need to be perfect has really taken a toll on my self esteem in some ways. I used to be able to stay at a healthy weight and eat whatever I wanted and I never gained a pound. Now I can’t do that lol and it has been a really hard thing to adjust to. The extra weight kinda crept up on me. Last year I was always putting myself down, like “how could you let yourself gain so much weight!?”. Stuff like that. This year, I’m taking a different approach. Trying to be more patient and taking it one day at a time. Making positive changes in my lifestyle to FEEL better, not just look better. It’s already kind of working. I haven’t lost any weight but I do feel better, just by eating less and exercising more."

AlAnon,fhce7ok,t3_ezwync,1581461453.0,"My fiancé has been sober for 2 years, ever since he found out he has cirrhosis. He was 27. He is so much happier and healthier now and says he has no desire to drink. Our relationship is getting stronger and stronger. I’m sad that it took him almost dying to quit, but we are just taking it one day at a time now and never looking back. Creating new and better memories together."

AskReddit,fh2omt2,t1_fh2mato,1581258828.0,I can see where that mentality might come from. I hope that this whole movement empowers BOTH sexes to report sexual assault when it happens and I hope that they are listened to with compassion and respect. I’m hopeful that eye opening threads like this one will help with that too.
AskReddit,fh2m6zu,t1_fh2lp2y,1581257609.0,"That’s crazy, sexual assault is sexual assault, I don’t care what gender you are! And it’s terrible when it happens to anyone. There shouldn’t be a debate on who has it worse at all. We just need to listen and be kind."
AskReddit,fh2l9rr,t1_fh2ggst,1581256822.0,"Wow, I’m shocked at the amount of people on this thread who say the women in their life tell them these assaults aren’t a big deal. I am a woman and if man in my life told me something like this happened to him, I’d be very concerned and upset."
UnresolvedMysteries,fgy73va,t1_fgy5ty9,1581180172.0,"Let’s see, I first heard about it on a YouTube video. It was like “top 10 mysterious deaths” or something like that. It really piqued my interest but what really got me invested was the Crime Junkie podcast episode they did, and then I listened to the 2 girls one murder episode, and then the true crime garage episode. I’d love to listen to your episode! What is the podcast? Is it available on Spotify? I’ll be sure to listen if I can. 

I’m also super curious about Elisa Lam’s mysterious death that everyone thinks was an accident...that case gives me chills."
UnresolvedMysteries,fgy5vyn,t1_fgy1oqa,1581179799.0,Same with me! I also watched without a trace and CSI religiously but law and order was always my favorite.

There are only like 5 or 6 people in this world I genuinely enjoy spending time with, and I even get sick of them after a while. So I guess my mom and my brother can come visit me every once in a while if I get lonely. But only for a few days, ha."
