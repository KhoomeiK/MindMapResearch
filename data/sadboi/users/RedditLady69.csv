CashApp,fqwwe6u,t1_fqwvw25,1589719638.0,I owe on one but that’s because I didn’t give their parent money through the state when we first split up. Always do that. I got screwed so hard 4 years later.
CashApp,fqwvgq5,t3_gl779j,1589718857.0,It depends how much you owe. If you’re a little bit behind you will probably still get it or some of it. If you’re a lot behind it’s not coming.

microgreens,fjl5c1z,t1_fjl1s8j,1583440223.0,Typically everyone does hydro with coco coir. We all cut clean and deliver same day to our restaurants. I have several farming friends that do this. One is the biggest and sells to tons of restaurants and they have top notch quality. They produce a ton and the same quality and have a wider selection. You have to be competitive in my area. I would start small. My one shelving unit with 16 trays produces over 300 Oz a week if I could sell that much.
microgreens,fjksnz0,t3_fdzalc,1583433116.0,I was hoping to get $3 per Oz and to be competitive in my town I’m down to $2. I run sales pretty frequently for 1.50 when I have extra. I still have don’t have a lot of buyers. I’m also in my local town farmers market. 3 other people sell microgreens.

zyramains,fhpwkx5,t1_fhpw3x7,1581796045.0,I last hit with autos so I have plenty of mana from my starting item. Use your spell more efficiently. I also buy a mana crystal before I’d finish morellos. I normally never have to leave lane. Except when I need to buy.
zyramains,fhpqi46,t1_fhpopai,1581793744.0,"Second item is Ludens I’m sitting at 30 magic pen, 30 cdr, and a good amount of ap and hp. Even without the item I don’t have a problem dealing damage or suppressing them in lane. Maybe work on better seed placement and make a trap with your seeds."
zyramains,fhpma6j,t3_f4amcz,1581792129.0,"Morello is always my first item after a mana crystal. Magic pen, ap and hp plus grevious wounds. With sorc boots you do a lot of damage."

zyramains,fhct0yd,t1_fhcrk4h,1581470216.0,"Whenever someone around you has low HP you will see a DH indicator on them. It you hit them they take extra damage and it adds a stack, making DH do more damage each time it procs. You don’t lose stacks from dying. It’s perfect for going finishing someone off with your E (which also does extra damage on low hp targets)"
zyramains,fh4ilb2,t3_evuf8u,1581279021.0,Almost always as mid. If I’m against heimer I’ll take a second point in my seeds they don’t get insta killed by his turrets before my my second point in E.
zyramains,fh4eisw,t3_f0xeb6,1581277938.0,"I run DH, taste of blood, Eyeball collection and ravenous hunter for my main tree. 

Presence of mind and Coup de grace for my secondary to keep mana up and to help with DH stacks on those low hp targets.

10%cdr,
9 Adaptive power,
Armor or Magic resist based on what your matchup is.

I try and and do my first back with at least 650 so I can get boots 1 and mana crystal. Next I normally get the first item for Ludens for the mana and cdr then rush sorc boots and the first item on Morellos for the magic pen. Finish Ludens next. Just poke and play reactive. I run heal/flash to get out fast after popping my ult and to heal or help the jungler when they come to gank. It’s off meta but I love it. 

You should have 30% cdr, 30 magic pen a ton of mana and some decent ap around mid game(lvl6-7 earlier if you got a kill or assist). I can solo a drake or rift if you’re smart with your plants and ult

I always keep a ward or control ward in both bushes so I stay safe. Heal is a life saver for sure because she doesn’t have a lot of mobility.

Poke and harass everyone. 

I’m not very good but have a 9.6 KDR in mid right now with this setup!"

Kenshi,f4ou1oa,t1_f4okdl7,1571708392.0,Nope. We train in vain with beak things and gorillos. Only the strong survive.
Kenshi,f4oazc9,t1_f4o9fuy,1571698733.0,Thanks. It must be a bug from a mod or something.
Kenshi,f4oa52o,t1_f4o7o4w,1571698421.0,Ok thanks It’s probably be that.
Kenshi,f4nrnrt,t1_f4nqvt6,1571692391.0,I watched it go up from 1-12 only using unarmed then it just stopped. I’ve equipped a weapon it goes up a few % on a level then I remove the weapon and it will go up again until it hits the next level. It could be a bug. I’m not sure that’s why I’m asking. It’s definitely weird.
Kenshi,f4nqe4v,t1_f4npurb,1571692071.0,No the attack stat determines your ability to hit people. It goes up on my other unarmed people but not this one dude. Anytime you attempt an attack it should go up regardless of weapon equipped. I’ve put 200+ hours into the game and use MA a bunch and this occasionally happens.
Kenshi,f4nozzz,t3_d9je85,1571691653.0,Kenshi 2 please. You can redo Kenshi later if possible. Spend your time and effort on the new game.

I use the same size shelving units from Target for $60 I can do 16x 1020 trays per unit and can germinate/ store about the same on the top level. I bought my shop lights from Walmart for $8 a piece and use 2 per shelf. I also highly recommended 1010 trays with holes for drainage I set mine in a 1020 tray and bottom feed. I never have to mist which makes everything easier.
