He would also constantly compliment me (love-bombing) and sometimes I think he did it so that he could receive compliments in return. 

If I didn't say anything back, he would tell me to call him sexy or hot, so I did and about a month into it, I did start seeing him that way. Now I really do think he's SO hot, but it's strange because I can't deny the facts - I did not see him as attractive initially, his face nor his body (although other people did say he was a good looking guy.)
