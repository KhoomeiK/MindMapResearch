They are very good and Michelle is a kick ass heroine and role model."

It is honestly one of the best books about depression I have ever read. I have depression and what I really loved was that at end there was no miracle cure or person who suddenly appear and “cured” them; there was just acceptance."

Unfortunately physiology is more processes and explanatory mini essays so it doesn’t really work."

I am a student studying human physiology and anatomy. I actually have 2 anatomy modules - applied and clinical - and (as weird as this may sound to some people) I LOVE studying it. It just makes senses to me and is really easy and because of hyper focus I could study it for hours and never get bored of run out of motivation. 

Physiology on the other hand.... is a completely different story. I find it so boring and uninspiring to study. I feel asleep today while writing a to do list on what to studying for my physiology module. I can’t stay focussed for more than 5 minutes before my brain starts to wonder (and that is when I am on meds). I know some people would just say “then do 5 minutes, take a 2 minute break then try again”. Expect that I have been doing that and it’s been 2 weeks and I am still no where, so I need a better strategy. Please help me!"
intj,fp5qs6s,t3_gbh0g3,1588337694.0,I am also a female INTJ and I also want to go into criminalistics/forensics. I also have that problem on everything depending on the situation rather than just a blanket yes or no answer. I have found that instead of saying “it depends on the situation” try saying “can you give me an example?” Because then you will have a situation and can make the call
mentalhealth,fp3tsuc,t1_fmwsbcu,1588285671.0,"My anxiety has also gotten so bad that I consider it paranoia. This isn’t the first time, but this is definitely the worst. I went through a patch about 2 weeks ago where I was convinced that I was being poisoned (and it coincided with bad acid reflux which didn’t help) and when this happens I STRUGGLE to take my medication which obviously just makes everything worse. I was also convinced that my mother and my cat were spying on me and constantly watching me. 

I am also TERRIFIED to leave the house. Even just going outside into my garden was really difficult at first. If I had planned a supper and I didn’t have an ingredient, I would change my whole meal instead of going to the small shop down the road which almost always has no people in it. I also can’t wear an n95 mask because I don’t like anything touching my face and I feel like I can’t breathe in them and that sets off an panic attack. 

Luckily the paranoia has (mostly) passes but the anxiety is still VERY REAL. I hope you feel less alone now. And if anyone has any tips, please share!"

collegeinfogeek,foxh56q,t3_fnvrgl,1588143840.0,"I also struggle with just plain old-fashioned online learning (like reading a PowerPoint, looking at pictures, reading articles, etc). The way that helped me stay engaged and not lose focus after 5 minutes or just get incredibly bored is to watch videos on the topic. Most of the time, they don’t cover exactly what you need - sometimes it’s too much and sometimes it’s too superficial - but at least it helps to get stimulation like you would in a normal class setting."
