I get what you're saying, leave the mods for Private or Friends-Only lobbies, dont fuck with other people's experiences because that's retarded. But dont forget they are people too and you acting ""holier than thou"" and shunning them for trying to be a part of the community in one way or another is NOT helping anything at all other than your *own* pride and putting yourself on a banlist. That's one more lobby you will never be able to join and one more person you can't actually do a Vanilla, unmodded heist with. If you like burning bridges for your own sense of accomplishment then that's you, go right ahead, just don't consider yourself any better than the people ""tainting"" public lobbies and the community.

Regardless of if he/she/I have BPD, with any relationship, if your partner is toxic, try to help them, but help yourself first. You cant help someone who can't help themself and the same applies to you. You should both be trying to understand each other's boundaries and respect them, but should also understand each other's shortcomings, and try to mitigate the effects they cause, which is easier said than done. Just remember we're all human, all make mistakes, and holding on to grief, anger, or loss only makes the situation worse, nothing positive *can* come of it. I wish you the best in your relationship, man."

BPD,ex32knj,t1_ex1zriw,1565979191.0,"So, I'm gonna make this as simple as I can, as you've already made some assumptions that I don't necessarily agree with but am not offended by.

1: It is not wise to go to a subreddit full of sufferers and call their actions selfish, you're asking for trouble and as a stranger unaffected by our condition, you're *really* not making any friends that way. Atleast change your wording up, it came off douchey. I'm not gonna play the victim card here but imagine having absolutely **no** control over your impulses for reasons you can't explain and the only thing that people can rationalize your problems with is by saying your selfish and not trying. It'd be very invalidating, the worst thing to a pwBPD and subsequently, yeah, the invalidated would want to knock a motherfucker out by those same impulses, I can guarantee you. Not threatening or insulting you in anyway, just saying invalidating a beeper's feelings is bound to set off Borderline Rage/or atleast an episode of lack of control, in one way or another.

2: Secondly, I want you to think about this condition, commonly known for what exactly? Emotional dysregulation, marked by **I N T E N S E or overwhelming** emotion/Along with a set of self-destructive coping mechanisms we use to handle those painful, fiery emotions, but always fuck with our ""interpersonal relationships"" and lives. I mean it's in the name, self-destructive, it's bound to fuck up *something*. Now tell me, what have you done while you were \*emotional\* that you wouldn't have done while you were calm, collected, and normal like usual? Probably a shit ton of things, unless it's not in your personality or character to be emotional in the first place. One could argue ""Oh, but you were aware that your actions would have consequences in the moment, shouldn't you have stopped right then and there, considering you knew better?"" **NO**, because once again, the lack of impulse control and being able to stop ourselves from fucking up is a trademark of Borderline Personality Disorder. Don't believe me, look at any post referring to ex's/bad habits and look how bad these people struggle with controlling their urges. You can't just say ""stop self-destructing"" when it's literally hard-coded into us to default to doing so. We were ***made*** to fuck up our lives, therapy and support systems are there to help marginalize the long-term damage while we still can. Not saying we should all stop caring and just say fuck other people because *I'm* messed up, I'm just saying that we are BOUND to fuck up at some point or another like anyone else, we just do it more often than regular people. I hope this didn't come off aggressive or pompous, just trying to educate an outsider. Much love <3"

BPD,escx9jf,t1_escahas,1561841342.0,"I completely agree, pwBPD are born people-pleasers, and I feel like if they have a deep attraction to a person/will to serve them, at least in the idealization period, then 9/10 times the person on the receiving end will be overwhelmed by the unexpected acts of pure kindness. This would probably lead them to making a conclusion about the pwBPD along with the lines of a kindred spirit or really, really stand up person. It also leaves alot of room for the Beeper to be taken advantage of, because the majority of people can NOT reciprocate that type of loyalty or mindfulness, and we definitely know that the pwBPD expects to be accepted and nurtured, but also expects their partner to fail them. Essentially, we set ourselves up by doing these nice things, because we are waiting on the moment where the other person does NOT bend to our needs, giving us the idea that they don't actually love us or theyre all bad. I believe they call this complex a ""self-fulfulling prophecy"" but the only thing it fulfills is our idea that we are bad people and don't deserve/can't be loved. Fuck, I hate dating."
