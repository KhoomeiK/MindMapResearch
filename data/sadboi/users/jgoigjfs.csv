Im pretty shy but i somehow have talked danish with a lot of different people. I feel like danes are very outgoing, or it's just that i am very shy."

it's ok to feel bad sometimes. But please try to focus on being a good mother. Also find something productive to do, that would take your mind off of things and give you a challenge. It will keep your brain young.

It was noon so only the wife was home with her baby and toddler.
