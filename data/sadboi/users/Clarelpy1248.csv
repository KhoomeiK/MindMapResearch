She needs to get that forcing your opinions down someone's throat is disrespectful and she wasn't willing to learn when the dad tried to state his pov. He isn't throwing her out on the streets, she has a home to go to.

Also, I'll change my vote to ESH, the dad could've dealt with it much better. A time out and sending her to her mom's place for a week or so would be good enough. TBH I don't think she learned anything from this. Are 16-year-olds this immature nowadays? Jeezus."

Kids are bratty at that age, it's normal. And they live in a fairy-tale fantasy where everything revolves around that one guy. Also pretty normal. But kids need to grow up, you don't just ship two real people together to the point where it's uncomfortable.

Treat her like an equal and don't look down on her though, how hard it may sometimes be. Lay it on gently but lay it on thick. Enforce boundaries. Whenever she says something that makes you uncomfortable pull back and let it be known that it's *not* welcome.

If she continues this behavior, give both of you a time out, about a week before meeting again. If she tries to talk to you or hit on you before the week is up, or vice versa, reset the week.

As for the 11-year-old, tell her firmly that no, both of you are friends and nothing more. You don't have to be harsh with them. Tell them that they can't go around shipping people because that's invasive and inappropriate. Constantly reaffirm it in their heads. Continue to be friends with them but make sure boundaries are in place. They're new to teenhood and fragile, don't hurt them too badly.

I've been on the receiving side and it is important to have a balance of being hot and cold in an even way. Distancing yourself will just make things awkward and hurt her. Allowing it to go on will put you in an uncomfortable position and escalate things. If you want to maintain this friendship, you need to find a balance. Good luck mate."

Ask, no, get your husband to have a stable job. Even part-time if he's so insistent on his dream. Sell the goddamn house and move into your safety net.

playwriting,fq9g5kq,t3_ghdqcr,1589197200.0,"Interesting concept, I like it! However, the dialogue, especially at the beginning felt too long for each character, seeing the same name with the cont'ds was somewhat overwhelming. There was a bit too much filler and it took quite a bit of time to get to the main point. In playwriting, you want to show, don't tell. The characters don't have to mention every single part of the room. The characters seemed to go back and forth on the same point where it felt a bit boring without much additional info. The pacing felt slow and somewhat cumbersome.

For a teenager like Heidi, it would be odd to have her calm down that quickly after being locked in a room. And I don't think the man would have so quickly opened up to Heidi about his loss.

Now that we've got the little critiques out of the way, I like the characterization, and I could instantly recognize which character said the next line without having to read who said it. Your concept was interesting but I believe can be improved. For your first play, this isn't bad at all!

Usually, first drafts contain a lot of fillers, especially when it's one's first script. If it doesn't advance the plot, improve characterization, or reveal information in any way, cut it. Heidi's theory about aliens can be left inside because it demonstrates her immaturity and naivete. Them going back and forth and the man mentioning constantly that there's no way out can be cut; saying it once shows his pessimistic and somewhat nihilistic personality, and his stubbornness is already shown by his unwillingness to fight back against 'them'.

It isn't a bad play at all, but improvements can be made. Good luck!

Also, the witch hunt bullshit needs to stop, wait until there's concrete proof before jumping into conclusions. Do people feel justified in condemning a person who they do not know, on a scenario they do not know the details and context of, to feel high and mighty and like they're hot shit when they aren't even equipped to do so in the first place?

""The answers is there isn't one. Karen is being a bully and a dick to get her way, two very masculine things. People have tried establishing one but none have really taken hold and that is because there are tons of masculine names associated with being a bully and/or a dick.

Deleted Whatsapp, deactivated my old Instagram account and made a private, new one that no one knows about just so I could keep up with my favorite comic series. Deleted the number of the person who broke my heart, boxed up bad memories in a box and left it in some cabinet.

So. Liberating.

It's like starting fresh with a new identity.  I stopped worrying about what people thought of me, I dived into plans to further my studies and my passion: playwriting. Previously I had a lot of unresolved trauma and I was dealing with it badly, countless panic attacks and all. And I'm still struggling with it, obviously, but the load seems lighter somehow.

The people I cut off weren't bad people, I know for a fact. But neither of us are in the right mindset to communicate our issues now. So maybe in a month? A year? 2 years? Who knows. But I'm working on what I love now, and I'm glad that I'm not distracted from that.

Kicking out an 18-year-old kid without warning to live with his immunocompromised (and possibly abusive) mother in the time of a pandemic?

Heck, coworkers get together and break up and they have to see each other at work daily anyways.

The universe doesn't revolve around the daughter, the son can hang out with whoever he wants provided that they're decent people. I'd tell the son that they're broken up though, to prevent him not understanding the situation leading to more drama down the road.

It wasn't your fault, and as a person with constant depressive symptoms and panic attacks, lots of past trauma and currently going for therapy, mental health can be finicky from an outside perspective.

Encourage him to seek professional help and maybe relationship counselling. I suspect that there's something going on. None of this is your fault, and do take care of your own mental health, as it is just as or arguably more important to yourself. 

This is a tough time period worldwide so try to be there for each other. Remember that if this behaviour escalates into something more frequent or abusive, you are NOT entitled to stay. I do think that he has some issues and he needs professional help, but make sure you take care of yourself too."

Disappearances have unfortunately been uncommon throughout centuries and in different parts of the globe. Yes, she died alone and scared and that's absolutely tragic. Yes, there is the possibility of this case not being an innocent disappearance, but something more sinister below the surface. But do refrain from using disproven facts to prove your case.

There has been no instances of sexual abuse according to the reports. Yes, some cases do go under the radar and this might be one of those cases, but what we have confirmed are the cold, hard facts that have been presented to us and that's what we have to work with. It's best not to jump to conclusions based upon beliefs without concrete facts, or knee-jerk reactions. It's also better to rule out all the rational and most-likely conclusions before moving on to the what-if statements.

If there were sexual themes involved, I do believe the family of Nora would not hesitate to expose it. They have nothing left to lose, considering they're from another country, they're the victims of the case and that they have hundreds, if not thousands of people both locally and internationally on their side, and that by leaving the job to the very VICTIMS to expose the authorities as money-greedy cover ups, it would be more harmful to the country's reputation rather than admitting the facts of the case outright.

I can see why people would get suspicious over this case, of course, it's a girl who was randomly found in the jungle we're talking about here. But attacking the authorities, investigative forces or even the family without credible sources would not take on a wise stance. There is the possibility of foul play and we should not rule out that possibility in our theories yet, but it's best to work with the facts we're absolutely sure of for now.

First of all, she's not your daughter, so you don't get to ‘parent’ her. I don't even know why you asked this question here as it seems like based from your edits, you have no care that chances are that you're in the wrong.

There is no benefit to making her pull out of Drama Class other than making her miserable. This is her passion that you're talking about. As a theater student, I would be absolutely livid, then sink into a serene state of apathy for everything else, including my other classes. I'm not joking. I once gave up an essay competition that could get me a full university bursary so I could be in a play. We're very passionate about what we do.

The next issue is that you did it without consulting her parents, which is just a major asshole move. You have no right to meddle in other family's business. And even if you were her parent, she would grow to hate you. She isn't your child so stop being so controlling.

Other than that, it was unfair that you jumped to punishing her right away. You said that she had no time for physical activity, so teach her ways she could manage her time. Such as getting a bike so she can cycle to drama practice or going to the gym with friends. She can also help run errands around the neighbourhood. 

The worst part of this, however, is that you let your self-righteousness get in the way. Who are you to control her life like this? Despite all the other judgements, you still never even CONSIDERED that your actions may not be as justified as you say them to be. You aren't doing this for her benefit, but to exert control and to say that you're in the right. 

I seriously hope that you gain some form of wisdom down the road and a little more empathy as well."
AmItheAsshole,f77xn3p,t1_f77v1th,1573479369.0,"I don't think anyone truly can understand love, much less unrequited love. Despite your affections not being returned countless times, it's always different with the next person. Heck, I've been in love with people who don't love me back 3 times and it still hurts like a bitch.

Moving on isn't easy at all. Because we are all individuals, we all have our own ways of coping that we have to figure out. Perhaps it gets easier for some, but that's because they know already what works out for them. And that's good, but it's okay to still need time to figure things out.

From here I can tell that you really trust your friend and that's a good thing. Trust prevents misunderstandings and betrayal and isn't easy to come upon. Do you have any other people whom you share the same trust? It'll help to talk about them on this matter as you can get an outside perspective as well as understand your own feelings a little more.

It's not wrong to feel love. Love is not exploitative or selfish if it's genuine. Just because it isn't reciprocated doesn't make it any less valid than the love between a couple who've been together for 50 years. Just because he can never feel the romantic feelings that you feel for him doesn't mean he can't love you. He can, but in a platonic way. Never think that your friend doesn't care about you.

I just wanted to tell you that in case you feel any misplaced guilt from this ordeal. I'm sorry for the  rant but I hope you know that it's not wrong to love someone."

This is a tough one... If I were in your friend's shoes, I would absolutely want to know about something like that. Also, I have the belief that open communication is important and this might give you closure, and that it's necessary to comprehend our emotions for ourselves and others.

On the other hand, the fact that you're in a conservative country might cause unwanted gossip and rumours. The letter might accidentally go public. It also might harm his relationship.

If he were single and it were a more liberal country, it would be wise to let him know your feelings to avoid future misunderstandings, seeing as you have accepted the fact that he  won't feel the same way, I don't think admitting feelings in a scenario like this would be too bad.

HOWEVER. This person has a girlfriend. And you are living in a place where same sex relationships are not widely accepted. On the flip side though, your friend will not understand why you are suddenly distancing yourself from him and this also may cause him worry. And don't say that you can act like it doesn't affect you, because subconsciously we all act a certain way due to emotions, and they WILL be very obvious, especially if your friend is good at reading people.

My suggestion is not to write a letter like that, but to sit him down and tell him privately about these feelings but let him know that you do not intend to act on them. Give him time to process this, at least a month of no contact. This is only if you are sure if he will receive it maturely and secretly tho, and if you're close to his girlfriend and you know that she will understand.

If you know that he'll freak out, do not tell him. You do not want to be outed. If the girlfriend won't react to it properly, or will get jealous or mistrust you (which unfortunately is the case most of the time) do not tell him. 

I know people who have been in similar situations, but good communication usually helps all parties solve the issue at hand. This entirely depends on your relationship and closeness to them, and if they have the ability to deal with it in an adult manner. 

This is just my opinion though. Any other suggestions or disagreements are welcome and I would like to debate about it in a civil manner."

Jesus, OP she wasn't even doing anything to you. You KNEW she had a bad home life. You KNEW that she needed emotional support.

Did it ever occur to you that you were the only mother figure that she ever had, and you just humiliated her and brushed her off?

I've had amazing teachers I could talk to, one of them I'm so grateful for as this teacher helped me a lot through my hard times. Teachers don't just teach kids on cold, hard, facts. They teach kids and help them GROW into formidable adults. They serve as secondary parental figures. 

You pushed away a girl who you knew was suffering and hurting. Do you know why she was clingy and followed you around? It's because she felt safe around you and you took that feeling of safety away. 

You, as a mature adult should have dealt with this in a more mature manner. There were so many ways to go about this. You could have sat her down and patiently talked to her about things and offer counselling. You could have just casually brought it up. The fact that you chose the harshest way astounds me. 

I mean no harm and I'm certainly in no place to lecture you about your methods of teaching. But still, try to care more about your students and practice empathy with them."

AmItheAsshole,f5fjc1t,t3_dnjb7n,1572183241.0,"Dude, your dad is delusional and paranoid. No offence.

You're this talented kid who works with art and music that's good enough to earn $ and he still finds something to complain about. This situation sucks and frankly, it isn't good for the development of a teenager.

Technology is only gonna get more advanced and if he has a problem with some innocent apps that post random food pics and softwares that can make bank, he won't survive in the future of hybrid cars and flying drones.

He's being an absolute ass rn but it might be from a budding mental issue. He seems to have paranoia issues and wants to have complete control over your gadgets. If it's possible, try to talk to your mom about seeing a psychologist or even a counsellor about this. You should visit one as well to help you deal with being deprived from the social web on the internet.

If I'm being honest, your dad sounds really closed minded and he's likely to turn his nose at the idea of talking to someone. Try to get one of his more open minded friends or someone he trusts to convince him. It's obvious that he has issues and is a control freak. If this is left untouched it might grow into a series of manipulative behaviours and controlling patterns.

I know that this advice isn't the best, but that's all I can think of at the moment. Wishing you the best of luck OP. NTA big time."
