Same with your boyfriend. I think the only thing you could do is find out who actually shared what happened first to a trusted person and that will be a little more telling of what happened.

You shouldn't have confronted your sister. You outed your boyfriend's assault by doing so. I've been in his spot before and it fucking sucks.

Also who's story was more detailed? I can tell you that I remember so much more from my assault and recall a lot more than the dude who tried to rape me. Consequently the dude was my girlfriend's brother at the time... but I was immediately believed by my girlfriend because I came forward first, he had done similar things before and I had text messages of him apologizing."

Every single aspect of their care is debated and done differently from person to person.

BeautyGuruChatter,feev5zi,t1_feecnuk,1579041900.0,I've watched her channel and she isn't the best pet owner but she also isn't as monstrous as OP is making her out to be. A lot of reptiles care is super controversial. There are factual aspects but things like feeding your reptiles in a container is regularly practiced. I don't do that as a per owner but I wouldn't call it animal abuse.
OliveMUA,feekop4,t1_feejola,1579035697.0,"I looked at the photo again without night mode on and I think you're a warm golden olive. Nyx bare with me foundation in vanilla nude will probably work for you, it may be a bit neutral and light. I would check out smashbox studio skin in 1.05, they also have the concealer in the same shade. That one always runs warm on me and I am a muted neutral olive.  One concealer I really like is the studio master concealer by maybelline in 20 light. It's super cheap at target.

MUFE y225 would be a good one to swatch, but probably not the best if your skin is oily. Nyx is by far the closest match to my winter skin and the best finish, I pair it with the hydro grip primer by milk but it's a pretty forgiving foundation.

\*edit: I have tried many of the foundations shared on this subreddit so if you want to pick my brain you're more than welcome to.

also another tip, don't trust the lighting in stores. It is so deceitful for us olives. Walk close to a window or go outside and look in natural lighting. Samples are good if you can get them."
