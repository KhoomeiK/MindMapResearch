relationship_advice,fmjuo0p,t3_fvdxws,1586138112.0,"I have struggled with having lower ambition compared to “how much I am supposed to have” in the past. This happens because of the messages you hear from people around you on what you are supposed to want in life. I read this speech excerpt by Bill Watterson and it made a lot of sense to me: 

You will find your own ethical dilemmas in all parts of your lives, both personal and professional. We all have different desires and needs, but if we don’t discover what we want from ourselves and what we stand for, we will live passively and unfulfilled. Sooner or later, we are all asked to compromise ourselves and the things we care about. We define ourselves by our actions. With each decision, we tell ourselves and the world who we are. Think about what you want out of this life, and recognize that there are many kinds of success.
Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it’s to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential — as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth.
You’ll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you’re doing. There are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you’ll hear about them.
To invent your own life’s meaning is not easy, but it’s still allowed, and I think you’ll be happier for the trouble."

BingeEatingDisorder,fexvu24,t3_eqqjgb,1579437291.0,Try intermittent fasting without excessive calorie restriction. Give yourself a week or so on it - your hunger will automatically go down. Eat a little more in the beginning if you need to. Try breaking your fast with a carb free / low carb meal and have your carbs later in the day. I used to be hungry all the time - this has worked like a miracle. Try making sure you have your daily quota of veggies and protein during your eating window. I also have black coffee with 2 tblsp of heavy cream in the morning during my fasting window - it doesn’t raise insulin so will not make you hungrier and still help with fat loss

My dad was a violent alcoholic and I mostly hated him and wished for him to die but also loved him sometimes. I felt  a mix of numbness, sadness and relief when he died. It’s been almost 20 years and I still hate him and sometimes I have positive feelings for him. I don’t fight them, I don’t blame myself. It wasn’t what I deserved but it was what it was and it has contributed to who I am today and I accept it.

I can’t do restrictive diets because I am so afraid they will lead to uncontrolled eating given my past experience. So this time I am trying to lose it slowly with only a moderately restrictive diet which doesn’t leave me very hungry. I am also worried about regaining but I guess it’s good to know that it’s likely so when the time comes we will be prepared to deal with it and not slack off. I don’t want to get into the self destructive spiral where you gain after reaching your goal and nothing works anymore so you decide to as well eat and wreck it all - I am an emotional eater so I am trying to prepare myself too. I guess it is a lifelong process and about changing your habits for good and I am starting to make my peace with it. I hope we are able to figure it out :)

loseit,f45qnkp,t3_djgt39,1571390423.0,"I have read a lot of research that says weight loss with excessively restrictive diets causes hormonal imbalance which affects ghrelin and leptin, the hunger and satiety hormones and causes extreme hunger after weight loss. Metabolic rate also reduces since the body gets used to surviving on fewer calories. What helps is exercise, especially the one that builds lean muscle since it raises metabolism. In fact, exercise is more important during maintenance than the weight loss phase. 

Frequent weigh ins are also associated with successful weight maintenance since people tend to relax after they reach their goal weight."
loseit,f3zk08y,t1_f3xxbmd,1571270799.0,"From what I have read, as per research exercise, especially building lean muscle is more important in maintenance than during weight loss. Also regular weigh ins are associated with maintenance success"
loseit,f3zf1m6,t3_ditkji,1571268069.0,"Hey, great work on losing all the weight in the first place! I wanted you to know that what you are experiencing is normal and happens to most people that lose weight. Maintaining weight loss is really hard and the change in hormones / metabolism makes you hungrier and it’s a difficult struggle with your willpower. Please don’t get discouraged but it’s important to understand why this happens so that you can address the problem in the best way possible. Here are a couple of links which explain this well:

https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2018/05/calorie-deprivation

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/maintaining-weight-loss

It will be harder to control your cravings once you have lost weight. But you need to continue to eat healthy (and not diet) once you have lost weight. Plus, from what I understand exercise is more important while maintaining than losing, especially strength training to build lean muscle. 

As others suggested, you should consider meeting a nutritionist. 

This might feel harder at the moment but if you develop and stick to your healthy habits, in the long term you are likely to be able to stick to and maintain a healthy weight. Take it slow and steady and don’t beat yourself about it. 

Also listen to the podcast by Cookie Rosenblum - she is a psychologist and focuses on emotional eating. Good luck!"

I will also stop focusing on calories eventually - since this is new to me, I am trying to be aware of how much I actually eat in terms of calories, macro nutrients etc. but I don’t plan to do this long term and would like to move to a more intuitive style of eating as you suggested

BingeEatingDisorder,f3wb9lb,t3_diibt6,1571196700.0,"Thanks so much for doing this! After years of trying to lose weight, I have recently started a more structured meal plan - I am not overly restricting calories (I am 5’5 172 lb female and trying to eat 1400 - 1500 cals plus extra for workouts) and trying to minimise processed carbs, increase fresh produce and protein. I eat when I feel moderately hungry and don’t eat just for the sake of a mealtime. I have started to lose some weight. 

I am very concerned about studies showing that 95% people put the weight back on. I am trying to do this slowly and follow a plan which I can mostly stick to after I reach my goal weight and therefore have not kept it too restrictive. I am happy to lose weight slowly but I am really scared about putting it all back after reading all the stories. 

I also add a cheat meal every week and have noticed that it helps. 

Can you suggest some ways that I could keep on losing weight sustainably and prevent the weight gain after I reach my goal weight - I have read about the reasons for the weight gain being hormonal and metabolic. Thanks a lot!!"

You sound like you are getting depressed. It is understandable if the relationship meant so much to you and it’s suddenly over and there is nothing that you can do about it.

offmychest,evbnkgd,t1_evbcaxh,1564385081.0,"I hope you are feeling better. Sometimes everything looks bleak and hopeless - remember it’s just a phase and will get better.  Maybe you will look back one day and see how much stronger and happier you have become from now. I really wish that to happen for you. You owe it to yourself to take good care of yourself, realise your potential, do all the good things you are meant to do. Sometimes, we feel extremely overwhelmed and sad but it’s good to know that it is caused by  chemicals in our brain and it won’t feel so real and strong all the time. There are small things you can do to feel better - go out in the daylight, exercise (try some running / high intensity cardio), eat healthy food, talk to people even if you don’t feel like it - believe me it really does work. Good luck to you and I really wish you will feel good soon"
offmychest,eva2ud3,t3_civyzm,1564337458.0,Imagine how good she would feel seeing you happy. Please talk to a therapist or a friend or family member about how you are feeling. Message me if you want to chat
offmychest,euan3j0,t3_cffxhz,1563625802.0,"Thank you for doing what you do. You are the real hero for people like us who don’t have the strength to do something real or deal with an animal’s real pain. We need people like you in this world - so thank you from the bottom of my heart. You have no idea how meaningful your life is - I wish I had the courage to do something as good as that with my life. It seems like you got overwhelmed because of some jerk - I guess with all that you see and go through every day, it can happen. I hope you take out some time to de stress and relax on a regular basis because this can burn you out emotionally."

Now wherever your dog is, he would hate to see your brother sad and crying, it would break his heart. Tell him that all your dog wants now that it’s dead is to see your brother happy so he can be happy too in doggy heaven"

JUSTNOMIL,epmyj36,t3_bv54zb,1559318967.0,"I am Asian and familiar with these cultures. Something quite similar happened to me. However, my MIL has schizophrenia and is not perfectly rational. When I met her for the first time, she completely ignored me and just talked to her son and treated me like an outsider (which continues to this day after 14 years). She kept telling him that he is too young to get married (he was 27). She lived with him and was completely dependent on him due to her illness and threatened him that she will leave if we get married. She knew that her son cared too much to let her live alone. He tried for a few months but she refused to even talk about this. He went ahead and said she could move out and we are getting our own place and getting married (they both stayed in a rented apartment). 2 days before we were married, she changed her mind and decided to stay with us. My life was living hell for the next couple of years - she is single and not well and he couldn’t have left her along plus he had enormous guilt which was reinforced often. During this period, she made several demands and her needs always came first (she demanded pocket money and being taken out to expensive dinners) while we struggled with work stress and home stress as a newly married couple. I also didn’t want him to abandon his mom - when I had enough, I told him I was moving out and he is welcome to visit me - I don’t want to be the cause for separating him and his mom but can’t do this anymore. He then decided that we need to be together and we need some distance from her. Gradually, he has set up boundaries and so have I. I hardly ever talk to her and neither does he now. We just fulfill her basic needs. But the first few years were severe stress and very painful. For Asian men, guilt for moms (esp single ones) is common and deeply ingrained. It’s very hard for them to stand up for their spouses. I suggest you clearly spell out your concerns and need for boundaries with your boyfriend. Also be clear about not wanting to live with her. Believe me it’s not worth going through, she will never treat you like a human being, always as someone she competes with. If he is not open to making changes, please seriously consider if you are prepared to waste the best years of your life"

loseit,epb08ud,t3_bucwyk,1559135950.0,"I can relate to this. Basically, your end of day binge has become your source of comfort at the end of a long, tiring, stressful day. And it’s hard to break a habit like this. Scientifically, food (esp the ones high in carbs) does release feel good chemicals in your brain and your body starts craving this when you are tired and stressed.  To break this, you will have to try hard and replace this with another source of comfort - for eg you could go for a brisk walk / jog while listening to music to de stress. Or meditate and have a relaxing tea / shower while eating something healthy. It will be very difficult in the first few days but keep trying and you will gradually be able to break it. Exercise releases the same feel good chemicals in your brain - in the beginning you might find yourself too tired to do this but slowly as your body starts enjoying it, you will feel like doing it more and more. Good luck!"

OvereatersAnonymous,eolypt3,t3_bs7o2r,1558678589.0,"I know we all know this but it is a fact that eating sugars and processed carbs leaves us more tired and the vicious cycle continues. It’s about changing bad habits and replacing them with better ones. I have had success in phases with the following - eating protein and good fats when cravings hit with minimal processed carbs and trying to eat veggies with every meal. Over the course of a few days, this really does help bring down cravings and I hardly ever experience uncontrollable hunger when I follow this. Try this and be patient with yourself - it takes some time to form these habits but it works"
loseit,eobbtnl,t3_br7ctx,1558439224.0,"There is definitely a mental and emotional component to binge eating. I have seen my patterns over the years - it’s a way of self medicating  and numbing myself when I have emotional issues or stress. I have recently discovered other ways work as well - whatever they say about intense exercise releasing feel good chemicals in your brain is all very true. But it’s hard to shake off old habits. I try to deal with my stress and mental issues in healthier ways but fall back to food as a destructive source when the stress is high. But at least I can recognise what I am doing now and gradually keep trying to change it. Also, consider joining overeaters anonymous - it’s a great support group. I was astounded hearing people talk about their eating experiences- it was unbelievably relatable. Good luck :)"
