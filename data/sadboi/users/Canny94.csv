EDAnonymous,fg8fju3,t1_fg73dor,1580617998.0,"Its more of like I will feel faint or hungry but will drink a ton of water instead.. I mean I guess in a sense I may have unconsciously ""trained"" my body to only need possibly 1hr where i might eat a decent meal or supplemental shake. When I see people snaking or eating a ton often, I get a feeling of disgust. In no way do I judge or criticize people around me for eating freely, to each his/her own, but internally I picture myself eating that family size bag of cool ranch doritos in one sitting and my mind is telling me ""you dont need snacks, you might jump back over 150 and get a fat face"" 

And yeah playing with meds has been a major part of my life... Ive been through a bunch of them over the years, zoloft however was the only one that slapped on the weight. I think it ruined my self image, it aided in making me terrified of gaining any weight at all."

I respect the man for his work to better himself (5yrs sober myself) 10 years is an amazing achievement! He is an awesome human, and has a great thing going with shady records, and had a decent single here and there.

But to all of the hip hop/rap enthusiasts on here, we would be lying to ourselves if we said that his music didnt nose dive after his work to becoming sober.
