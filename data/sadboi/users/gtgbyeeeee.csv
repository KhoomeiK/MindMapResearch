mentalillness,fl0sb07,t3_flre4c,1584714639.0,I don’t think meds help us tho for sure . I think it’s fucked and hurts us more bc they are Natural
mentalillness,fl0s85m,t1_fl0qwvi,1584714589.0,We aren’t rly born with anything. But genes are passed which makes sense for relatives and siblings to suffer the same. Like I don’t even understand why some ppl gotta suffer and others don’t . But this generation totally has more negative affects on our self guidance n shit . Rly fucked up. But I guess all I can do personally is try and cope .
cocaine,fl0okuc,t3_flv2gh,1584712143.0,U okay . Body is tired
Dreams,fl0nqav,t3_fle32m,1584711543.0,I have that too. I can’t remember if it’s a dream or not ? It’s lucid . And feels so real .
Dreams,fl0meeq,t3_flt6ho,1584710573.0,Just a sign of not having control
mentalillness,fl0lhap,t3_fjs66c,1584709882.0,There’s so many others that relate to you ^^ I love that you’re not alone . I can’t relate but my advice would be to fake It until u make It . Do what u have to do for the time being . Act how they want u to act but still have that sense of self and who u rly are . U can make It through .
mentalillness,fl0kfle,t3_fk9gxo,1584709095.0,Definitly journal . It’s a rly useful outlet for ppl like us
mentalillness,fl0jk7a,t3_flq70e,1584708396.0,I don’t think the psych ward helps people who are centered . U think ur “ crazy” Or mentally ill but that’s not a place to recover . Unless ur actually crazy lol. But It was traumatic so learn from It . Atleast u put urself out there to try and help yourself . That’s huge! Our minds r crazy as fuxk . Theres no turning it off but the wrong surroundings trigger worse things ya know ? Like maybe just change little things in ur daily life rather than admitting urself . It’s weird how little things create a catalyst of peace .
mentalillness,fl0iol0,t3_fkn9zy,1584707653.0,Shit happens for a reason . There’s bad and good but there’s  always two sides . Also childhood is what makes us who we are as adults : sometimes trauma helps us . It’s all about ur experience individually .
mentalillness,fl0hyhz,t3_fl6aq1,1584707002.0,There’s a lot of lonely people . It’s hard . But death is final . Why don’t we live out our lives for a while and see what happens? It sucks but it’s not unbearable . You not alone at all. Universe got ur back !!
mentalillness,fl0ha8x,t3_flswrm,1584706384.0,You are paranoid . Lots of people like myself feel that way . Schizo is a huge term for It . I think you’re close w the spiritual realm . Unless ur hearing voices ? But most likely ur angels are close by
mentalillness,fl0gnnn,t3_flre4c,1584705781.0,"It’s how you’re born . Sometimes there is no explanation . My parents Are fine and healthy . But me and my two sisters suffer from multiple mental illnesses . You just have to come to terms with it . It can be good if u believe it can. It can boost ur intelligence about ur surroundings and the universe, not always bad ."
Psychonaut,fl0fqa2,t3_e8bmzd,1584704873.0,"We cry a lot because we’re releasing deep shit . Trust me , nobody wants to admit our feelings . They seem invalid to most people . Even if they’re kind to us they can’t feel It and they never will. I guess we just have to see the light side of It . The way we can feel deeper than the average human . Alienation hurts but It can be good for this lifetime . We shouldn’t let others determine what we are because we are above the normal person. A higher vibration . Healers . We were meant to go through awful inner pain in order to take care of our friends and peers who can’t do that for themselves . It’s hard. But it’s a gift . Thank you for this post"
