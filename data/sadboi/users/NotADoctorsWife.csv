clothdiaps,fqfx7sy,t1_fqfmy30,1589333491.0,I’ll be discussing it with them tomorrow when I drop off LO. I don’t remember getting any paperwork on cloth diapers when we signed up (day care is corporate so there was a TON of paperwork). So far the only questions they’ve had were with regards to dirty diapers and I advised I would be bringing a large wet bag. Fingers crossed that they will be able to use cloth.
clothdiaps,fqfih2p,t1_fqf8y8w,1589325484.0,"Oh that’s a good idea to add photos. Especially with my LO being such a wriggle worm, it would be helpful for them to have a comparison."

clothdiaps,fqe7g4g,t3_gibbg6,1589302985.0,"If I'm using my CD, I use my Tidy Tots AI2 with two inserts. Admittedly, I'm prone to use disposables for some overnights and, if I do, I put a Sposies disposable insert in."
clothdiaps,fqe72e0,t1_fqe5pyf,1589302805.0,I haven't washed her CD with the sharpie marks yet but I expect it probably will wash off in the laundry. She goes back tomorrow and I'll be doing a load tonight with the sharpie marks on some to see. I've ordered the snap covers but those won't be here till later this week so the sharpie is a temporary fix.

BipolarReddit,fq8bqe6,t3_ghcqre,1589162606.0,Feel like I get the double whammy because I get it real bad with the cycling when I’m ovulating and then around ten days later when my period starts.
clothdiaps,fpxpluz,t3_gfr62x,1588987030.0,"I’m about to give up on my Simple Being CDs and just stick to my Alvas and Tidy Tots. No matter what, I always get moisture wicking on the front. LO’s shirt isn’t tucked in and I feel confident in the fitting. I’ve even tried swapping out the microfiber inserts for charcoal ones and the problem persists. Any ideas?"

clothdiaps,fp9nctm,t1_fp9es2f,1588430413.0,That’s probably my biggest concern. Did you try double stuffing them to increase absorbency or was it just the frequency of changes that made her not want to use them?
clothdiaps,foykamp,t3_ga9jyd,1588174054.0,I like the Flushies from Tidy Tots. They’re oversized so I can use them with my other CDs without an issue.
sleeptrain,fogdhce,t1_fog4t68,1587751176.0,"She’s rolling onto her belly when we put her in the crib for bed. It almost seems like she does it to prevent falling asleep. We had toys in her crib initially for when she woke up because she’s an early riser and giving her toys to play with bought me time to get up. But I think she’s rolling around partly because she’s trying to find them. Hindsight me is like, you made her crib into a playpen and now she doesn’t want to sleep there."
sleeptrain,fogd405,t1_fofv0o6,1587751041.0,That’s a good idea. She hates tummy time so it’s funny to us that she rolls into her belly so often.
BipolarReddit,fjfbel5,t3_fd3ygf,1583288280.0,"When I’m manic, my leg will jiggle like I’m anxious. When I’m depressed, it feels like I’m moving at the speed of a turtle."
bipolar2,fgi9xv9,t1_fghyy0k,1580813313.0,"I was told that Lamictol was the best bet because, if it would impact my baby, it would be in the third trimester and not in the first two when all the development is happening. But my doctor also told me that it would be safer for my baby that my mood be regulated and I shouldn’t feel guilty about keeping my mental health a priority."
bipolar2,fgh9lzz,t3_eyc3mp,1580779889.0,"I feel paranoid a lot when I’m manic. People know how to address depressive moods because they can identify what it looks like and there’s a lot more acceptance for helping people through it. But the manic makes people think I’m hyper, on drugs, incoherently irritated. I think it scares people sometimes because they don’t know why I’m talking so fast/loud or being hyper focused on things. I tend to retreat if I know I’m having an episode. But that isn’t failsafe because half the time I don’t know I’m manic till I’m midway through it. So I start wondering how many people know that something is wrong. The only thing that works consistently is just to listen to music in my headphones and isolate myself till it passes. I’ve opened up to a few people and they’ve been really good at coming to me and being like, you’re way too manic right now. It helps me balance out or at least step back for a while. I had to educate them on the signs of mania but I trust them to let me know when I’ve gone too far and people are noticing."
bipolar2,fgh7swz,t3_eygyk7,1580778702.0,I was able to stay on Lamictol during my pregnancy with more frequent checks with my OBGYN. I had a lot of trouble with the postpartum period. Feels like I went in faster cycling for the first four months. But I’m not breastfeeding so my doctor was able to increase my dosage to balance me out. All the best to you!
