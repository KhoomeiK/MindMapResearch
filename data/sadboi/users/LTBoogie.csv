doordash,f2exm2l,t1_f2exakn,1570205893.0,Yeah there are a lot of restaurants around me n I haven’t worked late night until yesterday. Thought Wendy’s would be taking orders way later than they did -I had to go on the door dash app to see when they stopped taking orders. It only took a second to ask them so why not try just in case I was missing something.
doordash_drivers,f1k474v,t1_f1k40be,1569531575.0,"Ok great n Thank you seriously. It gets so busy there that it’s is going to make a huge difference. Even if the order isn’t ready, I won’t have to wait in line or decline when I realize the process will take 40 min. Amazing!"
doordash_drivers,f1k3qaj,t1_esfobac,1569531397.0,Thanks! Just entered into Wendy’s app and it accepted it. This may make the new pay model  a little better considering the reduction in time to wait for an order. Much appreciated
doordash_drivers,f1dbe1h,t1_f1dadhy,1569378936.0,Do you think you would do it again for 2? Just got another $4 offer for 20 min estimate. No I’m not making $12 an hour. Uber eats is even better than this
doordash_drivers,f1da8kc,t3_d8v6vc,1569378019.0,Yup just got a 2.72 offer. It was probably going to take 15 min but im not doing ANYTHING for less than $7. Unless it’s 6 and going to take under 20 min. Multiapping is more necessary than ever. A lot of many these ppl are planning on tipping in cash but I’m not going to take the chance.
doordash_drivers,f0kaaxd,t1_f0k9ief,1568674371.0,I think the automated organizing of certain income and expenses makes it so easy for me to keep track of things. Like all of my deposits from every delivery app get categorized as income as soon as they are cleared. Or the parking charges on my card go to my parking expenses. Charges at the gas station near my house for gas writeoffs.  I guess it’s kind of been doing a lot of aitomated record keeping. I’m kind of bad at keeping up with that stuff though I’m sure I could give it a shot.
doordash_drivers,f0k50fx,t1_f0jxfr9,1568670468.0,What do you think and do you pay for it ?
doordash_drivers,f0jshmf,t1_f0js6xj,1568661987.0,Thanks I’m gona go back and set it up. I wasn’t sure about their $$ situation either. I recall the map showing my full day of deliveries were hilarious. I probably drove through the same streets 30 times every day.
doordash_drivers,f04oict,t3_d38zqa,1568392057.0,"Was in the middle of a brawl last night during a GH delivery at Burger King. Some woman completely flipped on this worker threatening to get him killed after work bc he was giving her “attitude”. She Ended up throwing a drink at him and then all hell broke loose. Register on the floor, drinks everywhere, cookie displays shattered.  She knocked everything off he counter and he ended up getting aggressive back. Then she had the nerve to stay and continue yelling. acting like it wasn’t her fault. I wasn’t even mad at him she was antagonizing and threatening him for 5 minutes straight. Even told the manager she was gonna have him “checked” and he let her keep talking shit. Honestly was a little scary because of the objects flying and there were kids there. Not a great part of town either.. People are nuts

Edit for autocorrected words"
doordash_drivers,ezvlqi3,t1_ezvlmw2,1568183658.0,Gonna give it a shot- I heard that uber eats tracks your speed so I assumed it was the same with DD.
doordash_drivers,ezupggz,t1_ezu7oeh,1568157977.0,I don't think so but you can probably estimate it based off of your order average.
doordash_drivers,ezu4att,t1_ezu42ap,1568145136.0,That’s great.  I find I can only do that if I cherry pick. Or use GH which gets me 20-25 but doesn’t have late hours
doordash_drivers,ezu414n,t1_ezu3y81,1568144997.0,Yeah I would be making like $10 an hour if I accepted everything here lol
doordash_drivers,ezu3sqz,t3_d25vu2,1568144869.0,"If that’s the case everyone in my market would be deactivated. I waste zero time and am assertive at restaurants, but it’s impossible for me to get above 70% in Brooklyn. I just do my best and I still have 4.96 rating."
doordash_drivers,ezu3hyt,t3_d2cn1m,1568144703.0,How do you take so many bad orders? Whats the average for your market?
doordash,ez5mvhf,t1_ez1wpu6,1567701611.0,Yeah they did- I had a feeling since I provided the screenshots they would work it out. I don’t think they want that to happen but very weird that it did. Def cashing out every day from not on loL. Worth it
grubhubdrivers,ez5mpes,t3_d002dy,1567701548.0,"Yikes I think my market is so busy that it doesn’t matter how much I reject.  I’ll get another one within 3 minutes. But I think that 3 minutes is the throttling they can afford to do. 
How does your throttling look?"
grubhubdrivers,eyxnnnw,t3_cz94l4,1567557926.0,It’s so disappointing. The fact that a girl gave me an extra cash tip the other day just because I actually went to her door was crazy. She said most refuse even though she left instructions. I asked grubhub about this when I first started because a group of other drivers at Applebee’s told me they don’t go upstairs. Grubhub’s response was that I should always deliver it to their door unless otherwise instructed.
grubhubdrivers,eyxn4h0,t3_czcvlv,1567557543.0,Were you in an apartment building? This happens to me often because of lack of cell service in the elevators and hallways.
grubhubdrivers,eyf3zli,t3_cwjz4h,1567043089.0,"I got a dash cam and been dragging my feet because the wires are annoying lol. I want it mostly because I’m on the road so much in city traffic as opposed to safety concerns. Unfortunately (very unfortunately), I mostly have deliveries at apartment buildings so a body cam is what I’d probably need lol. Haven’t had any bad experiences luckily."
grubhubdrivers,eyevzkg,t3_cwrtw9,1567039794.0,Interesting I hardly get non tippers on grubhub. $4 is common. The other apps kill me though.
doordash,ey0kuvs,t3_cuyza3,1566680230.0,Dropped off at a camp yesterday & the counselors came through ! Also got a $15 cash tip right after on a $5 offer. $40 in an hour
doordash,ey0j8qj,t3_cumkbv,1566679716.0,Something I have started doing is tipping the workers at restaurants I frequent a lot.. Just 1 or 2 bucks every once in a while for whoever is going to give me the order. Get names.  I’ve gotten preferential treatment at every place I started tipping. They are actually happy to see me and ask me right away who I’m picking up for. It has been completely worth it and feels very fulfilling
doordash,ey0ih14,t3_cumthr,1566679347.0,"On a kind of similar note- I have left food with the NyPD school safety officers when I have to drop off to teachers. I always found it kind of weird they don’t even try to call to find out if I’m actually making a legit delivery. They don’t always recognize the name either. I could be bringing in some type of contraband or worse. 

Just a thought I’ve had when making dropoffs in high security buildings"
doordash,ey0h9mv,t1_exvt485,1566679120.0,"I find that the customer support reps are Indian or somewhere near there. And the driver care reps they send you to are Americans.  Next time I call, I’m going to ask “mike” where he is located lol."
doordash,ey0h0ae,t3_cutmuy,1566678956.0,"Last night it took me forever to find some house. Had my flashlight and everything. I find it ring the doorbell because the customer wasn’t answering.  some lady peeks out the window then ovens the door all confused, telling me she didn’t order anything. Can’t reach the customer on the phone still. All of the sudden, some girl comes from around the corner telling me it’s her order and gave the name. I give it to her then she walked off. So weird. No tip of course lol"
doordash,exvky89,t3_cuh3qm,1566601249.0,Omg jackpot!!!. I’ve gotten Taco Bell twice. I hate Taco Bell so I give it to my neighbor. Hopefully I get  pizza one day. Congrats!

doordash,exusnbw,t1_exroh85,1566587863.0,Wonder if they’re gonna implement an acceptance rate minimum if people start rejecting a lot more orders
doordash,exusjhx,t1_exs6kg1,1566587825.0,"What I’m nervous about is I am always on time at the restaurant- but because of long wait times I only have a 62% on time rate in NYC.  Customers don’t know how inaccurate the ETA is and may blame me. It’s so common here, I have a keyboard shortcut on my phone so I can quickly text the customer about the wait.  That consideration will only take me so far if the food is 20+ min late. It is what it is, though"
doordash,exurbab,t1_exro2s5,1566587387.0,That’s interesting because it seems 75% of my pay is base pay. Grubhub is 50-50. I don’t know if it’s the market but so many non tippers on door dash. I got .20 cents the other day lmao. Not even enough for a parking meter here but it was more funny to me than frustrating.
doordash,exuqngo,t1_exr1q0b,1566587173.0,To be fair sometimes these can be cash tips- it’s a risk though.  I just took a $4 order on grubhub because I had a little time to spare and the customer was 7 minutes away.  There was no tip on the app but ended up giving me $15 cash.  Wasn’t expecting it but wouldn’t have gotten $19 for 20 minutes of work if I didn’t take that order. Feels like a game lol
doordash,exue3ym,t1_exu8pgi,1566582641.0,Yeah I agree about telling people off or the complete sense of entitlement. I just keep it moving. Currently doing a job on grubhub (where you can see the tip before picking up the order). This person has a $0 tip so I’m not expecting cash but would that happens sometimes with a $0 app tip. I’m still going get them their food on time and treat it like other orders. I say I usually will go out if my way to get extra stuff when I see the tip is very big. Like $10-$15 big. I duno if that makes me an asshole to the others but I do take pride in how I work regardless of the job.
doordash,exu7vvc,t3_cu6dwj,1566580450.0,That’s disappointing I would have wanted to say something sooo bad But it’s their right. Funny I started tipping everyone now. Even they guys who make the food at the busy restaurants I pick up from. I find they all make sure I’m good once I walk in the restaurant if I throw them a few bucks now and then. (Name recognition is even better) Not sure if that’s a pro tip but this job has turned me into a bigger tipper. I used to do $3 on every order now I do minimum $4.
doordash,exu73b2,t1_extwsg3,1566580162.0,"I hear you on that but I don’t think I would be doing this if I didn’t expect at least enough people to tip.  What I usually expect at this point is the big tippers to subsidize the non/low-tippers.  That’s what seems to happen on most days for me. But I would love to just get a flat wage. That would be completely fine with me. 
I’ll say the non-tipping disappointing at first though.  I have always tipped and didn’t even realize so many people don’t until I started this gig.  So as someone who always thought tipping was part of the process and an exercise of consideration, it felt like they do it because they can get away with it.  But whatever the reason is, it’s their right."
doordash,exu58mz,t1_exrrc8j,1566579472.0,That’s literally a condemned 2 bedroom house where I am in Brooklyn smh
doordash,exu50bf,t1_exs8kaa,1566579389.0,Every Burger King I’ve been to in NYC is like that :( one of them told me I can call ahead of time. The rest make you wait but can skip the line.  Still gotta remember it may take 15 min. The other day I waited 20 min and then left because the one girl preparing all the food told me she still didn’t know how much longer the order would take.  I usually don’t have too much of an issue but 5-15 minutes is the  wait time I expect depending on how busy.
technology,exmmc2i,t1_exmkutz,1566435106.0,"Yeah it’s for grubhub. I’ve seen people drop orders-probably after seeing the tips or because of unexpected wait times.  Not sure about the past but, as of now, drivers get penalized for dropping it once it’s accepted. I can imagine someone taking their time -probably the same people that eat other peoples’ food- but I personally am not going to be vindictive about it. I find I get the best tips on grubhub though it’s pretty amazing to see how many people don’t tip at all. 

The big tippers often end up subsidizing the non tippers lol. For instance I’m waiting in a Popeyes right now for 2 orders. The customers live about 2 blocks from each other. One game me a 7.69 tip, the other left me 0. And the orders are pretty similar. I stopped assuming seeing $0 in the app is likely a cash tip even though they literally have customize the tip in order to enter 0. I charge it to the game at this point. 

Edit for spelling"
doordash,exm6atz,t3_ctixgl,1566425284.0,Lol Ugh I have to drive 6 minutes from my house before taking offers. then usually wait 20 min to get to the front of the queue. Once it starts then we are on a roll though.
doordash,exm63bq,t1_exjl5g8,1566425177.0,That definitely it but sometimes it makes it worse when the 10 Minutes is up and know you’ve been lied to. I’ve seen dashers get serious attitudes and go back and forth with cashiers to the point of argument. It’s NYC & maybe that doesn’t happen other places but it’s gotten ugly.  Happened in wendys the other night and he ended up storming out. I always ask restaurants if the “10 minutes” is really 20. I’ve had people then answer that they don’t know. Which often means 25+.  I unassign unless the order is over $14 (happened to me the other night and I waited it out).
technology,exm4o68,t1_exl0alx,1566424464.0,"I agree with you and getting rid of tips. though to be fair, it’s never been my fault when food comes late -it’s the restaurant’s fault  for having poor estimates and not adjusting them. I’m only 60% on time because of the bad estimates in a big city."
technology,exm4f2s,t1_exktvgn,1566424338.0,"We can only see the tip after we accept the order. We only see the full offer amount before that. After accepting it is a pain in the ass to get unassigned from the order and you will get penalized if you do. If you cancel enough times,  then you can get kicked off.  I personally just deliver to whoever I’m told and feel a sense of disappointment when not tipped.  It sucks that we can make as little as $9-10 an hour if we don’t get tips.   I do believe the societal tip model is just awful. I don’t like that I have to tip so people make a living wage either. But the reality is that I can’t make a living doing this job without tips"
doordash,exd2eq0,t1_excxpc7,1566165524.0,"I refuse to do mall orders anymore. I just don’t think they’re worth it. Last time I did it,  Parker like 4 blocks away to avoid parking fees. Then go upstairs to chipotle only to find out someone stole the order. the store was so busy, anyone could have grabbed a “ready” bag off the shelf. . Had to sit on the phone w DD and the customer for 10 min. Crazy"
doordash,ex9qoth,t1_encl4l3,1566092950.0,"I have parking issues and apartments all day in NYC.  I just take the risk, pay meters if I find a spot and have my number in my dashboard.  So far I got one ticket and it’s because I forgot to put money in the meter."
doordash,ex9qgou,t3_bo61d6,1566092853.0,I have asked door dash about this and they told me that we have to deliver according to the instructions from the customer- as long as they are reasonable. The reason I asked them is because a door dasher in Wendy’s told me that we aren’t supposed to go upstairs.  I really do appreciate when customers come downstairs (or are already downstairs)- a huge help because parking in NYC is nonexistent. But that’s not something I expect.
doordash,ex9pkkt,t1_ex9opao,1566092461.0,Holy shit.  That sounds like an exaggeration but I know it’s not.
doordash,ex8thqr,t1_ex7rprq,1566078670.0,Lol in nyc I’m lucky if there’s room at a fire hydrant -especially near apartment buildings. My hazard lights are fully abused
doordash,ex07r6r,t1_ex06g15,1565906623.0,I really think Door Dash is responsible. They penalize drivers if they decline orders. Maybe they shouldn’t do that when multiple orders are declined but this is a door dash issue. They are giving us these orders and telling us they are on the way
badparking,ex06ob2,t1_ewggrll,1565906048.0,"Wow I would have asked him for his keys, told him to get an employee to move it.

Total confusion and then I just give in and hope that agreement placates then enough. Freakin exhausting lol
BPD,ewcmzxq,t1_eudcdot,1565287357.0,Have you ever had another borderline person do this to you too? I am BPD but also have another close BPd that has this ability. It’s so awful tbh they do accuse me of having a negative feeling any time they sense it. Half the time it’s jarring because it’s either inaccurate or it was just about to pass now you want me to explain myself.  I’m sure not everyone does that but I’ve experienced that being done to me n it’s pretty shitty and triggering when someone points it out with a connotation that it’s making them uncomfortable. . I can imagine it is hard to constantly sense emotions but I think it’s often not accurate and can tie into the way they see themselves.  as BPD this is more intense for me I’m sure.
BPD,ewclzzr,t3_cfy198,1565286949.0,"Yes I finally got the right diagnosis and am in intense therapy with group, one on one AND DBT daily. After 2 years I say it’s almost harder to be aware of how difficult it is to cope instead of just reacting and not even knowing why. But I also have more bursts of hope because of the skills I’ve learned. I’ve definitely made strides though it can be very hard to forgive myself if I do have a setback. At that point It can feel like no matter what work I do, I will always feel like it’s not enough and I’m too “fucked up”. I think I would rather this type of struggle because I feel more in control more frequently but it can be so devastating when I’m fully aware of how I overreact and know the reasons why (it always goes back to my mom of course)"
doordash,ewcczjq,t1_ewbz7h7,1565282580.0,Phew it was pouring last night in nyc. My first big rain delivery night. I didn’t get huge tips but instead stacked orders. Made 70$ in 2.5 hours. everyone was ordering from places 2 blocks way from their houses lol

I had 2 adult non-tippers yesterday and one was a $2.50 add on with 3 fight walk up. I don’t know how they can look me in the face. I still smile but it makes me disgusted ppl. 

On the contrary I got a 10 dollar tip one time and the man gave the $10 to his daughter so she could handit to me herself. That was pretty cool."

doordash,evruacs,t3_ckwg2p,1564718725.0,I’m 52%.  I never waste a second and am a good driver. The estimates in NYC can be terrible.  I have keyboard shortcuts set up for texting customers so I can quickly text/update the customer.  Luckily I still have a 4.85 rating so the communication probably makes up for it. It just doesn’t feel good knowing I’m doing my best and still have no control over that rate.
doordash,evqv5er,t1_evq0fe1,1564697800.0,I did some screenshots and screen recordings of anything that might show what was going on. I was getting some texts but then not showing up in the app. Mine was glitching all day and not sure if it still is but i haven’t gotten an order in almost an hour during rush hour in Brooklyn with millions of people. it wasn’t swiping when I delivered before either. kept DMing them on Twitter so they knew. They are pretty decent on Twitter and also there’s a record of your issues in chronological which may help.
doordash,evcmkd6,t3_cj8dqo,1564418548.0,Yessss luckily a lot of people come down for me but I am on my way to one right now. 11th floor so wish me luck on parking and actually finding the right door. Worst is 5th floor walkups here in Brooklyn.  I’ll be sweating and winded by the time I reach the apartment. Still appreciate this gig though :)
doordash,evbd7aj,t1_eurowrz,1564373246.0,I only did Postmates once. Got 3.75 and zero tip. May try it again but that was awful for 30 min
doordash,evbd1lj,t1_eurlh8s,1564373096.0,Which 12? I’m in NYC and just starting DD and PM
doordash,evariro,t3_cj1c4r,1564355258.0,"I think it depends on the market. In NYC, they do the criminal background check at the orientation. The driver record is done right away online."
doordash,ev9wbxg,t1_ev8otnr,1564332866.0,Sorry if this is out of place but do you like this better than lyft?
doordash,ev9vzcs,t3_ciwr6z,1564332621.0,I feel like the people who actually come on jere aren’t the types that actually eat the food. Or it’s a smaller percentage than overall. The people here seem to care about doin a good job. Appreciate u all because I’m new to this and haven’t worked in a while
doordash,ev9vvjj,t3_ciwr6z,1564332547.0,"Wtf just started but no way. Disappointing that the number is that big and that people don’t take pride in what they do.  Everyone up but this is a choice these drivers made to not care about someone else’s property. The other day I made sure Popeyes gave extra jelly packets and they threw in so many, that I debated takin a strawberry one because I love those. I decided screw it let these people get their extra jelly that they wanted and be happy. They worked for their order tho I don’t think that taking it would have been a big deal but I felt better about these people getting even more than they asked for in THEIR order.  Honestly, just as a human being actually touching someone’s food. I don’t get it even if it smells soooo good. Self discipline... I feel bad when I almost touch it when checking the order.  This job isn’t hard (it’s a grind! but still easy), so let’s take pride in doing it the right way. ❤️ def didn’t plan on this rant but just really sucks to hear this. 

Do you guys take extra condiments when there is extra? Definitely not as bad as actually eating the food but still not ours 

Edit for some spelling"
ProtectAndServe,er9xjfv,t1_er6wyio,1560631900.0,Well Actually I now have a fairer perspective than when I only saw the video and commentary on Twitter. It made me very upset and I felt the police must have been extremely excessive. Now I am being more critical and careful BECAUSE of reading LEO answers In this thread. Thanks op I don’t think you did anything wrong.
