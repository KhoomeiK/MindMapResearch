For example, during the time where I thought I wanted to be a doctor, I managed to get a volunteer position at a local hospital and also worked with a pet shelter.

ADHD,f3zz85r,t1_f3zos31,1571280490.0,"I did this once too. I was in the middle of a camping trip with my friends and something made me upset one day (whatever it was, it was probably really dumb because I can't even remember what triggered it.)

I convinced myself, ""you know, even your friends don't care about you, so why don't you prove it by getting lost and dying?!"" So after lying awake all night, just before dawn I set off in some random direction and walked for an hour or so in the snow until I hit the edge of a cliff. 

I snapped out of it when I heard some rustling nearby, and decided even if I wanted to die, I didn't really want to go by being torn apart by a bear, so I started walking back. Miraculously, despite my terrible sense of direction, I made it back to our campsite just when people were waking up."

I asked him again to clarify and it turned out it was just because he was at my house visiting my roommate and I didn't hear him asking for me, so he thought I was ignoring him all summer."

worldnews,f3unvq0,t1_f3ug1sh,1571164166.0,I'm with you on that. I was referring to epidemic in its literal sense (as in infectious diseases). I do think it's tragic that this many people are struggling to get enough food. It's absurd that this is a hard problem in a supposedly first world country that *over*produces food.
worldnews,f3u44h0,t1_f3tyt4c,1571152515.0,"Funnily enough, I am taking comfort in this. The fact that the US hasn't completely fallen apart as a country is a sign that, to an extent, the constitution is still working as intended. Things can definitely be better, but most people still have access to clean food and water, people still have access to services, and there aren't any major epidemics in the US to my knowledge. Now if all of this weren't so expensive and if these things were equally accessible to all people in our society, that would be great. I just hope I won't be eating my words in 10 years."

ADHD,f3evmtz,t1_f3eit78,1570886088.0,"What an interesting theory.... I wonder what kind of signals people have been reading off of me, and what kind of signals they're able to read off of other people that I'm missing! I'm not trying to say that I'm an entirely non-judgemental person, but I've always been puzzled by things like gossip because I don't understand how people form such strong opinions about others on so little information. For example, there's this person in my grad student cohort that got near universal dislike for a few things they (supposedly) said in class... And while I might have heard some of those things directly and sometimes don't like his attitude, I don't *hate* him because of it; I just haven't interacted with him enough to make that kind of judgement call.

Anyways, in response to your last question, I have found that through high school and beyond that I do seem to have some sort of polarizing aura even in people I've never met or talked to. For example, in high school, when I got the news that I was accepted into Caltech, the news spread like wildfire even though I only told two people, and I got a lot of hate from people I never knew. (Maybe this is a bad example because that this behavior might be just a precept of high school life and people at my school were hypercompetitive). Another is the fact that a segment of my cohort is unwilling to speak to me, going so far as to directly ignore me, even though I've interacted with them for less than an hour outside of class in the entirety of the several years that I know them. I've already combed through my behavior to pick out why they might dislike me, but I've come up with nothing and have since lost interest in trying to interact with them."

I've already been trusted with taking care of mom's tax returns and am trying to work out how to get more involved on the budgeting end, as she's prone to let things slip and is too stubborn to admit it. 

Inheritance has never been an expectation for me but I worry about my parents' health as they enter their elderly years and I'm not confident I'll be able to handle it all as the eldest and supposedly ""responsible"" sibling.
