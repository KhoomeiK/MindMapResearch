The negative self-talk is a LOT better. I was always so guilty about my own existence but now I just... vibe. I feel like I‚Äôm an asset at work, that I‚Äôm loved and appreciated at home, and that life is just gonna keep getting better. 

The only bad mood I really get in these days is anger. I get angry about people who harm my family members and I get really annoyed by dumbass coworkers. I don‚Äôt wake up sad or hopeless anymore. When I wake up, I‚Äôm not waking up with a smile on my face necessarily. It‚Äôs more of like, peace. I get some coffee, have some breakfast, and enjoy my time at home before having to leave for work. 

I still have other problems outside of depression, like a little bit of social anxiety as well as ADHD. ADHD always fucks my shit up in terms of motivation and executive dysfunction lol.

When I left and started living on my own, things were really hard money-wise. Every day was a struggle. But I was rebuilding my life by myself.

For example, I was transferred from my last store in part because the store could not afford two of ‚Äúme‚Äù on staff. 

One time I was transferred so I could get better hands-on training with a training manager. Another time I was transferred because an assistant I worked with became a GM so he wanted me at his new store. I most recently got transferred due to a promotion and to help change the store‚Äôs culture.

A lot of the time though, managers are able to stay at their original store. When I first became a shift manager, I stayed at my first store for a couple of years. 

But it is important to consider your own personal growth and your goals for future employment. If you‚Äôd like to move up in the Hut, you will have to remain flexible. At first I was really resistant to transferring to EACH of my stores, but each time I ended up meeting great people and growing in different ways! Ask yourself if staying in the same place and being comfortable is more important to you than possibly stepping outside of that comfort zone and moving on to bigger and better things.

Assistant Manager: RGM in training. Basically the right-hand person of the RGM.

After she leaves and I handle front counter, I give the rest of the tips that I earn to the cook. Drivers keep all of their tips. I‚Äôve known it to be customary for drivers to give the cook a cut for large orders, but at my store we don‚Äôt really get too many big orders, so it‚Äôs not common, and the cooks don‚Äôt usually expect that."
pizzahut,f648eih,t3_dpz91l,1572689597.0,"On an average Thursday we probably do about 90 tickets but we did like 170 on Halloween. It was chaos. We were projected to do like 133. For delivery we only did like 58 tickets but carryout was insanity. We‚Äôre definitely a slower store, but our location is decently new so comp sales growth has been fire over the past year."
pizzahut,f647hpv,t3_dq14j6,1572689342.0,"This sounds so close to my Halloween experience. We had like 20 future orders and most of them were HUGE and due at around the same time, so the day crew had made most of the orders in advance and set them aside on a dough cart. We had to emergency proof a bunch of dough and for about an hour our production time was 40 minutes with two cooks on the line. We ended up doing I think 177 tickets even though we were projected to do fewer than 140. We had 35 orders during one hour period alone. It was absolutely bonkers. Props to you, your GM, and the rest of your team for busting it out and killing the game. It felt comparable to Super Bowl for me."

pizzahut,f2pvuoi,t3_dc3k1f,1570351373.0,"Honestly, it‚Äôs not THAT bad. I personally went to management from being a driver because I was really tired of putting miles on my vehicle. If you really enjoy driving, you could still get some driving hours in addition to manager hours if you talk to your GM about it.

My biggest tip is more of a life advice tip. Use this position as an opportunity for personal growth. Learn something new from every day and every person you work with. Reflect on every single day and think about what you could‚Äôve done better. It might be a $10/hr job herding cats, and sometimes it will feel a lot like babysitting, but it really will teach you a lot. 

Other advice: make people feel at home at work. Coaching is important. Help your GM with little tasks and offer to take on small responsibilities. If you work with your team members, they will really go the extra mile for you. 

More than anything, be the manager you always wish you had. Think about shitty managers you‚Äôve had and do the opposite of what they did. 

Best of luck!!"
pizzahut,f2puo1i,t3_dd2zxy,1570350692.0,"My answer is that as long as the opening manager does a thorough-enough walk-through while they‚Äôre doing their Food Safety Checklist, there should be no issues when Steritech comes by. 

If this continues to be an issue, have your GM contact McLane anytime before 4 during the day!

And always remember that if any product delivered to the store looks damaged or messed up, you can call the QA hotline and report quality assurance issues."
pizzahut,f2ptgd6,t3_ddj08g,1570350090.0,"Good on you for staying positive and calm during huge rushes like that! Honestly I get a little stressed at first when that happens, but then I also get into that Zen-like state after that initial adrenaline dies off. There‚Äôs nothing like it."
pizzahut,f2psuwn,t3_ddumu6,1570349801.0,"I think this deal has a 2-liter on it as well. I‚Äôm not sure if your location has these particular deals, but for this, when I‚Äôm in a pinch, I use the deals for the $19.99 large specialty and large 1-topping and then add on the stix and 2-liter deal ($1 more for cheese sticks). The coupon code for the $19.99 deal is 920 at my store (NPC)!"
pizzahut,f1atgsu,t3_d57igk,1569306478.0,"So many people gave helpful tips! As far as driver duties go, the less-helpful drivers usually only do dishes and fold boxes. The more helpful drivers do both of those AND help with dough prep, sweeping and mopping, WingStreet, cut table, and front counter. It takes awhile to be crosstrained on a lot of these things, but if you‚Äôre invested in being helpful, you‚Äôd be doing your whole team a favor by stepping up eventually. Talk to the manager on duty if you‚Äôre interested in learning more!"
pizzahut,f1ascfd,t3_d7a71i,1569304979.0,"Oh Lord, I have one that stands out to me from my current store. I must‚Äôve blocked out other experiences from my more ‚Äúhood‚Äù stores lol.

I had taken an order over the phone from a regular customer. She had her young kid place the order over the phone, and I humored her, and I made sure to read the order back 100% in its entirety as I usually do when she put her mom back on the phone. It was a Big Dinner Box for delivery. (How is it that the worst customers always order Big Dinners?)

The mom calls back after it was delivered about a half hour later, saying that we forgot her 2-liter. I told her that I had taken the order earlier but she hadn‚Äôt asked for a 2-liter when I talked to her. I also mentioned that I read it back to her, but being the customer maniac that I am, I offered to send her out a 2-liter. She started being really rude to me and arguing with me despite me offering to send out the soda, which she obviously wasn‚Äôt even charged for. That night was a bad night for me emotionally and I was feeling really overwhelmed. This was wrong of me to do, but I hung up on her as she was yelling at me over the phone. (This was before I learned to humble myself.) I was so fed up with trying to please this awful, entitled woman. I figured that if she called back, the call center could help her get the 2-liter, and I wiped my hands clean of the situation.

Maybe 45 minutes later, a huge older lady comes angrily into the lobby and starts FILMING ME‚Äîyes, FILMING ME‚Äîon her phone. She‚Äôs narrating everything as she films me, chastizing me for hanging up on her. I apologize over and over again and she doesn‚Äôt even ask about the 2-liter. 

Moral of the story: don‚Äôt hang up on crazy ladies because they will come to your store and harass you! Actually, don‚Äôt hang up on ANYONE, just keep a cool head and do whatever they ask because your Bottom 2 Box comes first. Lmao"

pizzahut,ew4rtpp,t1_ew4qsru,1565116962.0,"Dude. I get what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm literally just trying to give you ideas. Hardly any AGM feels comfortable throwing around CSR hours, so you really have to make some argument to them that the CSR is a necessity. You can‚Äôt do that simply by saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs understaffed and stressful!!11!!1‚Äù You have to be able to point to things like the Hourly Tracking Detail Report, abandoned calls, your B2B, etc. and be able to say, ‚ÄúThese specific numbers are suffering during these specific hours but we could help it out if we scheduled a CSR between 5 and 9 on Wednesday through Sunday.‚Äù"
pizzahut,ew4qfie,t1_ew4pja0,1565116130.0,"This is why I said ‚Äúif you have a solid crew.‚Äù Your situation sounds like a nightmare because it‚Äôs basically YOU doing all the work and nobody else really going the extra mile and stepping up. When I was at a higher-volume store, my cook and I would pretty much trade back and forth with make, phones, front counter, etc. At a store like that, the cook would pretty much HAVE to be well-trained, otherwise it‚Äôs putting a lot of stress on the manager. For your situation, I think your GM needs to schedule a CSR, especially if y‚Äôall have a drive-thru. I would make the argument to your GM that it‚Äôs been slow so you guys should start pushing more hours into production/CSR rather than having them be devoted to driver hours. Even better would be to have a CSR who can drive and when it gets busy the CSR could go on the road."

One thing that I can suggest that you might be doing already is underscheduling insiders and overscheduling drivers and running things really tight on the inside if you have a solid crew. It‚Äôll help your speed a lil bit.

I also go to sleep and wake up around the same time every day and that really helps too. It really helps when you get rid of the people who drag you down and make you want to die."
pizzahut,etqmr08,t3_c4le8p,1563092273.0,I‚Äôd be willing to bed they‚Äôre doing the $19.99 large specialty and large one-topping deal. This is a common workaround for when you want just a cheese only.
