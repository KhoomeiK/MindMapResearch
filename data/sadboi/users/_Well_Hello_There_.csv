PewdiepieSubmissions,fpuslsg,t3_gfi28n,1588922307.0,"That’s such a mean thing to do. Parents think they are disciplining their children when they are actually distancing themselves. The kid and all other children that have gone through such bad parents will want to do things they were never allowed to and maybe overcompensate, because they saw their parents as wrong and therefore also their teachings. Yes sleeping on time is important but doing that will just make the kid hate his/her/their parent and want to stay up late more than usual just to get back at them. I don’t understand how parents think removing things important to their children is going to help them in any way, when they can’t let go of the stupidest things or lose things they took away from their children."
