insanepeoplefacebook,ffrapeq,t1_ffqzydk,1580154120.0,"i really dont understand why you and hammer keep getting downvoted lol. (current emt). over half of my calls are stuff that can be seen by either urgent care or a regular doctor appointment, only a handful are real 911 emergencies. literally had a nursing home nurse tell me the only reason a patient was going to the er was because they didnt want to schedule her weekly doctor appointments (which my ift company wouldve taken her anyway??).   


ambulance = stabilization for patients, on-scene and pre-hospital care.   
you dont need a wee-woo ride for a fucking headache. leave the ambulance for patients who are critical, where every second counts."
NewToEMS,fcbwo72,t3_egt9yq,1577591800.0,"Try to compare the width of your body to the cot when leading. This helps in tight, narrow hallways or avoiding traffic.

 Let your partner know if they're going too fast, need to push more or less, etc. Communication is key. If the cot cant fit, remember you can raise the cot to go over stuff, collapse the back, etc. 

Make sure the cot isnt too high, so the center of gravity is lower. Less risk of the patient tipping over and falling. Dont try pulling the patient from the side!! They might tip (this happened to me). 

When moving the cot by yourself, move from the center side of the cot with it close to your body, not at either ends. This gives you more control. 

Hospital mirrors are your best friend!! And before going into a house, go inside and scope out the best route for entering and exiting. Gives you a better idea of the trip"
AskReddit,faw67lz,t3_ealj7k,1576366512.0,"Since last Christmas shopping, my mom always eyed these painting easels that are wooden, stand on their own, extend, etc. Just really nice ones. She has a passion for art and found that painting was one of the best ways to decompress and express herself. 

She's had a rough 2019, lost a family member she was close to, her job, just not herself. For 2019, I managed to snag onto a decent paying job and feel like I can finally afford to buy all my loved ones really nice gifts (even spoiled my cats a bit)! 

So I bought her a nice easel and some expensive acrylic paints. Something I couldn't afford back then, but now I bought it with ease. I'm so excited for her to open it!! :)"

NewToEMS,fa6dutb,t3_e7rggd,1575823732.0,"Memorize it first. Repeatedly go down the list until you know each part by heart. 

Search online for medical scenarios for EMTs, usually they go down the list of signs/symptoms, sample, opqrst. If you provide a intervention like putting patient on o2, itll tell you how the patient reacted, etc. They are super helpful. 

Try asking your instructors or crewmembers at your clinical shifts for help. When they offer medical assessments at class, be the first to step up and just do it. Ask your instructors for explanations if you're confused about certain things, like how does this symptom relate to _. 
I hated assessments (both medical and trauma) just cause I felt like I didnt know what tf to do, but honestly, they were the easiest parts of my skills exam. 

Remember ABCs!! Those are the main focus. Good luck friend!"

The crew walked into the patients room, got patient on cot, then the newest member squatted down to introduce himself. Said ""Hi (patients name), I'm (new crew). How are you feeling today?"". Snap. Patient immediately rolled eyes back and went limp, dead. New crew member was hella confused, family freaking out and begging for resuscitation, nurses immediately barged in yelling to have the crew out of the room NOW. A few minutes later the cot was pushed out of the door way. Yep. She died.

 Company still charged the family :/"

If you are worried about losing your skills, go over some stuff in your book that you're confused on. Study like you're preparing for the NREMT.
