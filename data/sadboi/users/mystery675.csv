I would compare it to border line personality. But like, mild maybe sub-clinical bpd. 🤷🏻‍♀️ im not a clinician. I know he can be extremely toxic but its definitely a by-product with him. Poor guy. Love him still. I just mostly end up avoiding him in the house. Its working out. Sounds cruel. But I'm finding no stimulation is better than trying to allow an unhealthy person positive stimulation; because all things are filtered through an unhealthy base causing them to come back out in unhealthy ways."
Enneagram,fqv2xtt,t1_fpaldu4,1589668811.0,"Really wow. An infp 6🤔. This has been wondering me as of late (a couple weeks). I'm wondering is an infp 6 the infp known to lean a little more on the traditional/conservative side? (Vs. Infp 4 types). Since we do have one our function dynamics that causes us to look to past experiences and rely on that, i dont think its outside the realm of infp'ness (some say these traditional type infp's are mistyped). Then again i know mbti stereotypes are very extreme. Like for instance I've known many istj's who are independent and very very into sub-culture (despite the stereotype)."

Come to think of it my dad was same way. A withdrawn gemini. But i believe he had severe unaided adhd. I found out later my step-mom says he was diagnosed tourettes. I have no idea really how that would have played a part. I have many reasons, including knowing him, that i came to the conclusion he had lack of empathy (sociopathy). So that would have contributed to him being a state unto his own. Autonomous. Which he very much was.
Dang, lol, i hope i didn't get too dark on you. I guess the point is there are many other contributing factors."
