depression,f498bmc,t3_djse7j,1571459215.0,"It sucks how on days when I feel like there’s no point to my existence those who I go to for comfort and love to help me feel better and see the other side of things end up showing me their true feelings-how they don’t care about me either. Then I end up spiraling into a very dark place where I question myself. Why do this? Why exist anymore? That’s where I’m at. When hard days turn to weeks and months. When you question what’s good about you, what’s worth it, and those who you thought would have your back don’t. They just make you question it even more.

It’s hard to care about yourself when no one else cares about you either."
AskWomen,f3iqzsz,t3_dgz642,1570940965.0,"I wasn’t the fat one growing up but I was told I was fatter than whoever I was being compared to that day, I herd this so much I developed an eating disorder. I wanted to become the skinny one or tried to but I was still got compared to others and I still wasn’t seen as skinny enough. I’ve since been trying to learn how to love my body and I have chosen to be stronger-not skinnier or fatter. I’ve grown and relapsed, I’ve felt broken and I’ve felt powerful. It’s not easy but I’m learning and I’m trying to do what’s best for me and my future."
depression,f2n9npm,t1_f2n7uoy,1570313543.0,"I use to feel like you currently do. I tried very hard for a long time to work on these relationships to make them better and feel better but they didn’t ever put in the effort with me. I quickly got tired and felt both mental and physical side effects of doing all the work to make thing better. Relationships are 50-50 but I was taking on 90 while they held 5. Once I started to let go of that 90 I thought they would notice and pick up the slack but they didn’t and so it quickly got to 0-0 no effort and no relationship. 

I hope this doesn’t happen to you. I hope those people continue to mean a lot to you because those are the people that can give you strength when you feel tired."

AskWomen,f22o2ly,t3_dbb6wn,1569892879.0,"At my meetings we have a section of the weekly meeting where we congratulate or thank someone who went above and beyond in some way. Which is great in theory but what ends up happening is that everyone feels the need to thank or congratulate everyone for every little thing they have done recently (ex: thanks for picking up lunch, good job with that client). It then turns into something where if someone forms have something written next to their name others write things like ‘you’re doing a great job’ or ‘keep up the good work’. Which granted is nice however it takes up more time in the meeting since they get read out loud, usually feels like someone just wrote that so it wouldn’t be empty next to that persons name, and it feels like it’s no longer something special to celebrate, congratulate or thank the person for. This alone takes up about 15 minutes of our meeting."
PanicAttack,f22gy71,t3_dbk8kt,1569888824.0,"This happens to me at work too sometimes. I don’t know your work situation but I usually just go to the backroom we have with the supplies and sit there until I can get myself under control. Then I go to the bathroom and try to steady myself. Sometimes I tell my boss I’m going to the gas station to get some Powerade or chocolate or something just to get away for awhile without having people question me and then I go to my car to calm down. It’s not easy and it doesn’t always work but these are something I do. (My company is medium sized not big at all, that’s how I get away with this)"

AskWomen,f22ce97,t1_f1zxju6,1569886307.0,I agree. Everyone I know that is older than me or a generation before me had told me that more money will make things better as I grew up . More money will cause stability in life and in me. They pushed the idea that if I can make more money then I will be happy and this is a real blow for someone who was very sad growing up and never felt like I was enough to then start earning money but still not feeling happy. The idea was never money can buy happiness but that money would bring happiness to my life was a complete hoax.
SuicideWatch,f22bg3m,t1_f1znku8,1569885870.0,"I have tried to tell people about how I feel and the fact that I don’t feel good. Even when I do well at things I still feel inadequate. I feel lost in every part of my life. I don’t have anyone who understands but I do have people who don’t believe me which makes me question if what I am feeling, saying or doing is just dramatic like they say it is."
raisedbynarcissists,f1ye7yd,t3_dav4jz,1569814623.0,As someone who was raised with both Nparents lying about such little things that turn into much bigger things for what feels like no reason it can be very scary to get caught up in all of that. I remember my dad use to have someone call him and he would let the phone ring and then tell my my mom the lie he would say if he got asked about the call so they could be on the same page about each other. Then one time I blew their cover story and they got mad at me for not lying when I was around 7-8 years old. So from then on out I started compulsively lying for them. Always saying yes to whatever they say happened or didn’t happen. I didn’t even realize I was doing it until I got to college. It’s crazy how much reprocessing I’ve had to do.

raisedbynarcissists,f1ycdvg,t3_d4s40h,1569813699.0,I graduated from college and began working in a different city then the one my parents lived in. I got a job offer for a company closer to where they live and after not living at home for so long and not being around them I forgot what it was like to live with them. They offered me a place to stay while I looked for paces. Since I moved in it had sucked but now that I told them about where I would like to live I’m being bombarded with reasons why I shouldn’t go. You shouldn’t live alone you shouldn’t choose this area you should choose this are you should live with blah blah who lives in this area. They keep throwing reasons as to why I shouldn’t do what I want to do and why I should do what they want me to do. I am very annoyed and I hate feeling like this. Almost everyday there is an argument that gets loud because of something I say or do. Before it use to be about me moving out and now it feels like they just find reasons to get mad and yell at me. I am trying to move out as fast as I can to not be in this situation but it sucks to feel rushed to find the right place for me just because of what I’m dealing with from my parents. That’s how I’ve been doing recently.

I can’t stay asleep, I wake up constantly in the night and wake up feeling more tired than I was originally. However I have been having super vivid dreams, recently my dreams are of me dying so it’s weird because it feels like even my subconscious is telling me not to live anymore."
depression,f1vhb4e,t3_daut56,1569770886.0,I am glad that you’re going to a therapist to try and make things easier and better for you. Whatever your therapist says is meant to help you but it can be hard to listen them since it takes time and if you feel like me I’m sure you just wish there was a quick fix. I wish I could sleep through the night but I can’t even remember the last time I slept like that. It’s not easy to keep on track so I hope that you need someone to vent to I’m here and on the same boat.

Whenever I think about how they make me feel it’s always loved happy and supported. My SO is my closest friend and I like knowing that they are someone what I’ve never felt the need to lie to because they are very accepting of me and my faults.

AskWomen,f1d19dh,t3_d8ncma,1569371233.0,I say I’m an open book but there are so many things that I keep hidden. From things about my past to things that effect me today and will hurt me in the future if I don’t deal with it. I am scared to be open and honest to people because honestly there’s not much to love and appreciate about me when you really get to know me. There is so much that I keep to myself because I can’t imagine telling someone these things these and still have them stick around. I feel like everything is conditional so I am only loved and accepted by the people in my life currently because of who I portray myself to be not who I am underneath all of that.
AskWomen,f1d0smk,t3_d8myw6,1569370878.0,My routine is the same as most others. I get home and have a light snack and relax for about 15 minutes then I change into my workout clothes and either go to the gym or find something I can do at my place for 30 minutes to an hour on loop (usually HIIT). Then I relax with a light run and end it with a good shower. Showers relax me and I like to listen to music while I shower so I usually continue the music while I either warm up my food or make something fast for me to eat. Then I just relax by texting/calling loved ones or I play a few games on my phone all while having some show in he background. The biggest variations for me are workout types and times and what I eat because sometimes I order in.
selfharm,f0nltsj,t3_d5gqbw,1568773516.0,"This isn’t the same but for me when I get the urge I feel like I should keep my hands busy and so I end up writing about how I’m feeling and what’s going on in my life at that point. I try to keep myself busy-keep my hands busy. It doesn’t always help and I don’t share it with anyone. Depending on where I am I will type it on my phone or on a laptop and if I’m able I draw my emotions or write my emotions. I’m glad you are wiring letters and I hope to one day get to be where you are clean for so long, a great support system, and being able to share your writings with others."

AskReddit,ezmxbdp,t3_b4ebif,1567998144.0,"I’m not sure if someone has already said this but check in on the students who you think are doing fine. I cut myself constantly from middle school to high school. I was also in the honor society, choir, AP classes, and got great grades which caused all of my teachers to believe that I was doing just fine. No need to check in on me since I had the grades and looked completely happy but inside all day I was screaming at myself for everything wrong. My parents would always tell me what I did wrong and it stuck to me like glue but I knew not to let anything slip in school because things would just get worse. My parent use to say ‘do you want me to hit you? I will but do you know what will happen next? You’ll go to school and the teachers will see the bruises and then they will call the cops on me and who will be there for you then?’ And that scared me into compliance from a young age so teachers please look at the students who are quiet and don’t say anything and look at the students who you think are nothing shy of perfection because I got the awards and wore the smile. I was told I was a model student and that they wish their classrooms were filled with students like me but inside I was dying."

LongDistance,ez1z3j2,t3_czunst,1567651546.0,"I know that my SO really likes to eat so whenever they are very stressed I order food for them to be delivered to their place so that they don’t have to worry about cooking dinner that night. I think that doing small little things that you know will make the smile helps. One time we had been taking on the phone about cool movies that had come out recently and since when we are together we like going to movies and I bought my SO a movie ticket for them to go and enjoy a day to relax. Even if I couldn’t be there they could go enjoy themselves and feel better. Doing little things like a care package can help. Sending funny memes and jokes if they are into that type of thing, make them a playlist on Spotify of songs that you think would like. It can be hard to think of things but just think of little things that would make your SO smile and try to do that for them."
