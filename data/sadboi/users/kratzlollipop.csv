bipolar,f2uxkqy,t3_defk0y,1570434266.0,"I get these all the time! It sometimes feels like i'm trying to wake up and keep getting trapped by the dream within a dream, inception style. It is often focused on the completion of a task or fleeing something, or sadness/betrayal from others.

It happens even if I've had plenty of sleep and often alarms can't even interrupt them, I can hear the alarm going off but can't wake up. Or ill turn it off without realising.

No solution to offer im sorry! Mine are more common when I exercise so blep :/"
