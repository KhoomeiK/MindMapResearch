Anxiety,fg1p6qs,t3_ewcunf,1580431168.0,"I read your post and I'm in quite a similiar situation. I also wanted to post for a while now, but everytime I type my post I reconsider and just delete it all. Even had typed a very extended comment about my situation, fully ready to submit, but I also deleted that one and typed this instead. I don't want to burden you (or anyone here) with my shit as it doesn't help your situation at all. Merely telling you that you're not alone in this.

I always thought it would go away eventually. That it was just a teenager insecurity thing that'll pass with time, but it doesn't honoustly.. I'm currently 25 (male) and it's still there.. Don't be scared though as it does get better with age as you learn how to live and deal with it. Focussing on taking deep and slow stomache breaths through your nose, helps quite a bit. The stomache breathing part is essential here. Don't know how to explain it better as English is not my native tongue, but I hope you understand what I try to say.

Also, try to stay in a positive mindset and accept things as they are, if you can. That way you simply don't allow yourself to start develop depression or something similar. Things will happen in life and you simply can't do anything about that, so better to accept it and try to deal with it (later). Preferably with professional help of course, but I don't know your current (financial) situation. I can only speak for mine and unfortunately I can't afford it right now. Really wish I could've started that years ago.

Anyways, if you want to PM me or anything, I'm here. This is not my main account, but I'll try to check it once in a while.

Take care <3

Edit: Hm, still quite a long comment though.. Oh well.. By the way 'professional help' sounds scary and official, but even going to the general practitioner for advice is already seeking professional help."

Anxiety,ewv2urb,t3_cq2yu2,1565797431.0,"All the time. Even with texts... Sometimes I need 10 minutes to type a message which I then delete and retype and delete and retype, etc...  
Sometimes even just delete it and never send it because I think ""Nah, they probably don't care anyway"""
Anxiety,ewv2n0i,t1_ewu3eh4,1565797294.0,Have this all the time myself... Also always wanting to instantly defend myself when someone gives me feedback or give an opinion which I don't agree with.
Anxiety,ewv2bgq,t1_ewtzo3u,1565797089.0,"This... People around me always tell me that I overthink way too much. It just happens...  
I want to do something nice, but then I think that maybe she won't like it, so nothing happens...  
And when I finally had the courage to just do something, I get these instant regrets and horrible negative thoughts that she will take it wrong and distant herself from me, because she'd think I am trying too hard, or something. It's so annoying and ridiculous :/"
Anxiety,ewv1pxc,t1_ewucy4k,1565796707.0,"The problem for me here, is that (because of my fears) I usually act too detached which leads to her not actually getting to know the real me, which will then make them unsure about if they actually like the person they see or not..."
