Graffiti,fr67zfv,t1_fr677re,1589921503.0,yeah honestly if you put it like that it makes a lot of sense. i get that if a piece i did immediately invoked another artists work it doesnt hold much value.
graffhelp,fr67tbw,t1_fr64tg4,1589921418.0,"thanks so much! i heard that the white horse idea is pretty much taken - i guess i just thought it would be fun but its not something i wanted to be doing publicly anyway (the white horse in the pic is on my dads shed, not in public or anything). ill definetly do some more research on what would be more original for me. i know nothings really original but itd be nice for someone to see a piece ive done and not immediately think of another artist."
