They probably feel like they have to say something to help, and that's what they say. Best reaction would be just listen carefully and giving empathetic answera, but most of the people don't do that.
So, not the best reaction bet not the worst either"
Chonkers,extnuu4,t3_cu9ua5,1566571961.0,"This is what the girl says in Italian:

This is Stella. Everyone keeps asking why she's so fat. But we have have been to the vet already, and he said that she's fine! She weighs 20kg. (talking to the cat) isn't that right Stella?"

Also I am glad that the four walls make you feel that way, loved the interpretation of the flat beer as well!
I'll work on those verses. Thank you so much again"
OCPoetry,er329x7,t1_er25fvd,1560454463.0,"Yeah I agree. Also when reading the title I was expecting a critique of an unhappy couple that decides to eat at kfc and doesn't speak at all during the meal. And i think it's because of the title: eating at kfc is romantic at all, but then the poem tries to describe deep and true feelings

so yeah, maybe change the title"
OCPoetry,eqsfabd,t3_bz74es,1560283574.0,"I really liked this poem. I often write in this style asweel, with questions to myself, I just love it.

Anyway I didn't like the 2 ending lines too much, I think I would have found an image for ""the future"" , or some kind of comparison, or a circumlocution. Maybe it's just because I was expecting it, but I think it could be more original"
OCPoetry,eqsdudw,t3_bze5yw,1560282625.0,"What about trying to describe the situation with your husband and your boyfriend directly in the poem rather than explaining it? In general I think it might be an interesting topic to be described in a poem.

I also tend to do the same thing btw, I write something that only I can understand and it's perfect when I read it, but when other people do it I have to explain the context. My goal for now is to make sure that my point is clear when I want to share my poems

Hope I gave you some inspiration and let me know what you think about my point of view!"

BreakUps,eobcr06,t3_br5tk5,1558439750.0,"So true. But I recently overcame this fase. I just found friends i can share memes with, and I honestly sent dog pictures just to my ex. I don't like them that much anymore now. Also I just think now that there is no need to constantly share everything with someone, and if you're bored you need to be able to find something to do by yourself"
