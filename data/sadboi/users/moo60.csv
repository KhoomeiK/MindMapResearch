Proper meds, of course, were essential to begin with.  But next were life changes.  I learned what triggered me and made feel this way and why.  I removed negative people from my life, including family if necessary.  I learned to make better choices in how I dealt with people and how I let them affect me.  I found a job type which was less stressful yet still provided the level of earnings I wanted.  So I was were you are and much worse 24 years ago.  I'd say I finally got to where you are about 6 years ago.  There is hope, it can happen, but not overnight and not without significant work on your part."
