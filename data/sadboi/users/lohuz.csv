depression,f7zh3a7,t3_dxp0co,1574110596.0,I feel the same way.. I don't have any interest or hobbies. Every day is fucking same. I just wake up go to work come back scrolling reddit or youtube to waste time or just lay on the bed... and that's all. I have 2 friends and see them rarely. Even when i go out it looks like a distraction of reality which lasts a few hours and that's it.. On weekends just sitting at home doing nothing and trying to pass time and sometimes even music is getting annoying. I have 0 fucking interests I just don't enjoy doing anything and it sucks fucking hard.
