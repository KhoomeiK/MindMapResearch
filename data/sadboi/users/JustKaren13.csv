Yeah, I knew I couldn’t keep anything at zero. I don’t know for sure what my other party members are yet, but I’ll try to keep my CHA ok just in case we need a talky character"

Ok, so if I get 3 feats with the human feat, would it be worth it to take both evil eye and misfortune? Fly sounds fun too, but I’ve read online it’s not entirely useful. I originally wanted to be a healer character, but my friend has already built an Oracle. I’m still thinking more of a support character but I don’t want to be totally useless in combat

I looked over the list of familiars but none of them really stood out to me. I guess if I go with Fly maybe the bat...?"
