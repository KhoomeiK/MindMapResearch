UniUK,fhft4ui,t3_f2z0nl,1581550690.0,"Hey I also go to uni within the UK and also dont drink. It isnt a surprise to me though that people drink because from my experience Uni is very much just a place for people to have their first taste of freedom and so they take this opportunity and use it to stay out late, drink, socialise, etc. All things they couldnt do at home. But there are two sides to every uni I believe and there will be people just like you. Is there not a society within your university that sounds interesting? Surrounding computers, nerd stuff etc. Because there will be a huge community within the uni of people who enjoy things you do, you might just have to dig a little. And dont feel bad for not enjoying the party scene either. I dont but I found others that dont either."
