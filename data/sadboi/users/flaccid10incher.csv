BipolarReddit,fr2e1br,t3_gm3rzk,1589835676.0,I have Bipolar Type II and take Lamictal. I vape small amounts every once and a while and it helps me relax. My physiatrist told me he couldn’t advise me to do it medically as there really isn’t a lot of research but mentioned he has heard mixed feedback. Proceed with caution.
BipolarReddit,fpl4i2c,t1_fpjnlos,1588706217.0,Thank you!
BipolarReddit,fpjlbqc,t3_gdnfgw,1588672819.0,Do you have a link or name of the blanket you got?
Seattle,flp8lcp,t1_flp7uww,1585353901.0,Agreed. I meant more “stay inside as much as possible and practice social distancing.” Can’t edit the title:/
Seattle,flp4l5q,t3_fq2uim,1585351547.0,Just want to make a clarifying comment. Everyone should stay inside/at home as much as possible. Going outside to get fresh air is totally ok as long as we practice social distancing.
Seattle,flp4gfb,t1_flp20yw,1585351470.0,I wish I could edit my title to emphasize social distancing rather than “stay inside”. Getting outside is totally acceptable but playing soccer with 20 people just isn’t a good idea. I’m sorry to hear about the neighbors :/
Seattle,flozgd3,t1_floz45e,1585348614.0,Should’ve seen what it looked like when they had a corner kick...
Seattle,flox8xy,t1_flouqzm,1585347349.0,I agree that we should have a level headed response. I’m upset when I go out of my way to be sure I abide by the 6ft rule and sanitize constantly throughout the day only to see this reckless behavior. Events like this are serious and are putting lives at risk. I did report this and hopefully the city will have a reasonable response. I have seen other people use the field responsibly and would hate to see these guys ruin it for the rest of us.
Seattle,flovh25,t1_flomixf,1585346315.0,I see the irony. Probably could have worded my post a little better. Generally speaking stay home as much as possible. It’s totally ok to go out and get exercise as long as you follow the 6ft guideline. Hope you’re staying healthy!
Seattle,floughx,t1_flosl6n,1585345712.0,Eh I don’t care so much about the karma as I do for saved posts and whatnot.
Seattle,flofesq,t1_floe5ab,1585337254.0,God I even hate reading my username. Made it years ago as a joke with my friends and later discovered I couldn’t change it. It’s too late now.
Seattle,flodo2n,t1_floatrh,1585336287.0,"After Inslee’s stay-at-home order this shouldn’t be allowed. I will say, everyone beyond this soccer game within the park was respecting the 6ft rule."
Seattle,flodbdp,t3_fq2uim,1585336096.0,"At Robinswood Park these guys were bumping into each other, and constantly within 6ft of each other. Frustrating to say the least."

We even had compost going, but that was less successful as customers didn’t use it properly. As for the entire company, yes there is plenty of room for improvement."
