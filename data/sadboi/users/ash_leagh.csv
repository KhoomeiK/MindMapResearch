I think it‚Äôs important to grieve with your dogs. They‚Äôve gone through a loss too but at the same time your wifes spirit and soul lives on through them. I‚Äôm sure it would break her heart to see you like this, and I‚Äôm sure your dogs are also heartbroken (yes they understand this shit). Grieving together can be extremely healthy and freeing. 
I‚Äôd start by seeing a grief counsellor if you can and maybe finding smaller ways to help your dogs, like giving them favourite treats, spending time with them at home and maybe consider hiring a dog walker to take them out until you can. I hope things get better for you. I truly do.

Find a really nice smelling body wash or shampoo, get a bunch and rotate them. Buy yourself the funkiest towel and invest in a nice ass shower head if u can. Maybe shower right after u take ur pills (idk what ur treatment plan is but getting high as fuck on weed before showering when I ran out of meds helped me a lot). Also gathering up all of your dogs letting them chill in there with u helps too. Leave the door wide open and have the shower up extra warm if it helps. Reward yourself for showering by doing something u enjoy after, like taking a nap or having a good snack. A lot of this shit is weird as fuck but it‚Äôs saved me from being a stinky human.

(Scroll down for a TLDR) 
It made me feel awesome! Then it felt like my hands didn‚Äôt quite work properly. But I thought, ‚Äúhey I feel okay again right? I don‚Äôt cut myself as much and I can stop hoarding food and having awful nightmares‚Äù I started being extra jumpy,  like I‚Äôd had a ton of caffeine but I was always exhausted. But I felt great, I started losing weight, it didn‚Äôt  matter to me  if I was a bit jumpy.  

Then the seizures started, first in my sleep, I had a seizure while my best friend was staying over and she couldn‚Äôt wake me up from the couch. I didn‚Äôt even notice. The only think I noticed was the usual headache I had when I woke up. My doctor said it was normal and I was overreacting. So I was embarrassed, I left it alone.

About a year past, and everyone had just kind of accepted that I was a little twitchy. But in reality I was *A LOT TWITCHY*. I hid it well, but I couldn‚Äôt hold a glass of water, I couldn‚Äôt play any of my instruments and my core muscles were always so so sore from the constant contracting. I couldn‚Äôt sleep cause I couldn‚Äôt hold still. I didn‚Äôt remember anything and I was behaving oddly, friends said. 

Long story short, (and many many appointments later) the clomipramine had fried the chemical receptors in my brain. I‚Äôm allergic to it. My brain cells might repair themselves but probably not. It‚Äôs a condition called Tardive Dyskinesia and even though I‚Äôve been off of it for about a year now I still twitch randomly. My hands fly all over the place. It‚Äôs hell. I look like a crackhead. I need help doing basic things but I‚Äôm slowly improving! My loved ones help me a lot and I changed to a lovely doctor who listens and helps me. 

**** TLDR: Got ignored by my doctors, took the max dose of a medication I was allergic/intolerant to and fried the fuck out of my brain. Now I have seizures on top of all the shit I was dealing with before :)"
