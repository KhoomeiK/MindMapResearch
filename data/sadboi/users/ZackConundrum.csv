It’d be easier to do it intravenously because smoking DMT wipes you out after about 2-3 hits so you’d have to keep on puffing larger doses all day like he did, and even then your body would have cool down periods between trips I think.

I also have a cat that’s usually within 3 feet of me or he always stays where I can see him. Anyways, during one of my trips it was like 3 am and it was pouring outside and I did my usual “look outside with the door open for a few minutes and go back in” routine and then went to sit on my couch. After like 30 minutes I got up to get water and I realized my cat wasn’t anywhere to be seen so my acid riddled mind instantly assumed he slipped out the door while I was looking outside (which he’s never done). So I panicked and searched my apartment for about 45 minutes (it’s only about 500 square feet with a loft) and after I couldn’t find him inside I thought it was over. I began to break down thinking he left me and I was gonna never see him again so I went upstairs to my bed and laid down and then I heard a little meow next to me. My cat is black, and my covers are black. He fell asleep on my bed upstairs and I never bothered turning on any real lights other than my LED shit flashing around so I didn’t see him.

TL:DR
I was tripping balls and thought my black cat that was sleeping on my black covers got out my front door at 3 am in the rain which lead to a desperate 45 minute search of a 500sq ft apartment"
