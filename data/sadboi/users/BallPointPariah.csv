I've been making masks for a few weeks now when I can for myself,  friends,  and family. 


I wear glasses

I've been putting a piece of wire, 

 rolled at the ends so it's not sharp, 


 attached to the mask across the bridge of the nose, 


this keeps the mask tight to your face along the top and has stopped any fogging. 




I  sew the wire to the mask by placing a piece of thin ribbon over the wire and stitching the edges down.

I was 4, hungry, thirsty left to fend for myself by drunkards.


low and behold I find bambi on a bottle and glug it down. 


proceed to puke and pass out. 



wasn't till after a few days looking back at the footage that my ""bug"" was shown to be alcohol poisoning.

bettafish,fedn52w,t1_feas4yk,1579015571.0,"had the same issue, 

I put some soft sponge over the intake and the out flow to disperse the current and he stopped. 


found it a little stressful. within 24 hours in his new home my new boy had a hole in his tail.

he hasn't stuck on it once since the sponges were put in. 


I have been checking the parameters daily since in case the lower flow messes up the balance. 


have you had any water quality issues since you added sponge?"

I've been cycling and growing the plants out since late September 2019.


I think people thought I was a bit mad waiting so long, but I wanted everything as stable as possible. 


he's in an aquaone 30, a 22 litre aquarium.


there's currently a massive population of copepods in the tank, he was picking at them within 20 minutes of introduction. 


the only plants im struggling with at the mo are the sagittaria subulata, there was a quick melt back with few leaves surviving within a week. but new growth slowly appeared in the last 10 days. 


I also have cryptocoryne wendtii green, which I cut back to bare roots straight away to pre empt the melt,   it almost instantly started putting out new leaves and has around 20 decently sized ones. 


I've a couple of windelov java ferns, a narrow leafed java fern and a large chunk of java moss. 



the water is fairly dark from tannins from the drift wood in it and a couple of cattappa leaves. 



a sneaky bladder snail snuck in with the plants. 




I've been struggling with depression for the last year or so and it feels so good to want something, work at it, and achieve it at a time when I felt I'd no control over my own life. 


no pressure little fish!"

having pieces of cattappa leaf in the containers might help with stress. 


keep him somewhere with as much consistency in lighting and temperature as possible, so not a dash board for example"
