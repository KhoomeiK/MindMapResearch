e46,fggwl12,t1_fggs44p,1580771175.0,thanks i appreciate you taking the time to find that ! gonna call the place that put the wheels on and i'll give y'all an update in a couple weeks.
e46,fggrcou,t1_fggqzs7,1580767849.0,"nope, no creaking or weird sounds whatsoever. i was trying to wait on my brakes till it's warm, but now since i'm worried i'm gonna do them soon to see if that solves the issue."
e46,fggr72g,t1_fggn5nj,1580767749.0,MD never seems to fill any potholes either...
e46,fggr3qx,t1_fggmp62,1580767692.0,"do you know exactly why an out of balance wheel would cause shaking at only those speeds ? i'm pretty sure that's the problem, just curious of as to why it's solely in that speed window."
e46,fggqz07,t1_fggne5l,1580767612.0,"just got new tires, but the bushings do need to be replaced. i'm waiting until i get the rear subframe reinforced to do the bushings at the same time."
FortNiteBR,f7mnvbw,t1_f7mk0vn,1573868526.0,I'm on playstation and it sounds the same on two different headsets and on my tv when i disconnect my headset
e46,f7ktitu,t1_f7klzu0,1573825429.0,thanks ! saw the pic of yours and it looks awesome :)
e46,f7k9d2w,t1_f7jyvda,1573799265.0,yep lol people recognize my car now cuz it's such a bright red
e46,f7jvr9y,t1_f7jqtzs,1573787739.0,thank you ! i'd love to see yours with the clear turn signals and the red white taillights if you wind up getting them
e46,f7jq4as,t1_f7jjebx,1573783685.0,"thank you ! thankfully i haven't had any serious issues, just some general stuff that hasn't been replaced in a very long time."
e46,f7jd8k3,t1_f7jd126,1573775178.0,there's a good bit of both over here in frederick. if you ever go out to see drift nirvana (in wv) it's e46 heaven
e46,f7jcwso,t1_f7jbais,1573774999.0,md is where it's at ! i'm always on the lookout for more e46s around here
e46,f7jc9xh,t1_f7j3xy2,1573774637.0,"it's no problem ! mines a 00 328ci and i got it back in march for $4,900 at 127k miles. i bought it in wonderful condition with no problems at all."
e46,f7insj9,t1_f7inf7n,1573762614.0,thanks ! i'm in the frederick area
e46,f7iihlq,t1_f7ihrwj,1573760087.0,"yep ! they're high on my wishlist, but most of my money saved up for the car has been going into repairs lately."
cats,f7cokki,t1_f7cnr96,1573596694.0,so inviting...
holdmycatnip,f6uxemg,t3_dsydpo,1573171072.0,"this is really cute, but it makes me kind of uncomfortable"
FortniteCompetitive,f6ty8g5,t1_f6txvsg,1573155653.0,"i feel you. i felt bad for him until i realized that he monetized his apology video. i mean i still feel for the guy, but he knew what he was doing, and the consequences were clearly laid out in epic's rules. it would not look good on epic if they were to go back on their word now."
FortniteCompetitive,f6txr67,t1_f6tx3dc,1573155477.0,"bro did you even watch his stream ? he used aimbot in a real game which is completely against epic's rules. xxif didn't use aimbot, so you cannot compare the two."
FortniteCompetitive,f6tw3bc,t1_f6tuaw1,1573154841.0,"xxif's situation is not comparable to this one. yes he cheated, but he did not install third party software like jarvis did. xxif deserved the two week ban, and he lost his qualifying spot, but he cheated by trying to get free kills which is in no way similar to using aimbot. yes, cheating is cheating, but stop trying to compare what jarvis did to what xxif did. they're two completely different scenarios."
Anxiety,f6tvet4,t3_dswusn,1573154586.0,this made my day :) you just inspired me to get out of the house and go try to get food by myself. i wish you all the best ! good luck
depression,f6ofhe9,t1_f6of0au,1573016054.0,"yep exactly. for me at least, there's something comforting in the sadness because it's so familiar and safe. i haven't been able to cry for a very long time, so i'll watch sad movies or listen to sad music just to try and invoke some sort of emotion within myself, but nothing works anymore."
depression,f6odsof,t1_f6od8hy,1573014519.0,"issok. thank you, and idk if i did a good enough job of explaining it, but i feel for you too."
Pumpkins,f5ojgvi,t1_f5ohlxh,1572319887.0,hahahaha yes it is smh
antiwork,f5mhhpt,t3_do8rwf,1572289952.0,"okay so i'm gonna go against everyone else here, but i used to be in the exact same boat. i had some very horrible working experiences in the past that sucked. i was taken advantage of with very little pay, and i'd cry everyday before going to work. it honestly felt hopeless. now i only work a part time job, but i got really lucky and i found a place that i LOVE. honestly i'd just recommend not settling, and maybe looking for a private, small business to work at. i work at a more liberal coffee shop, and they take great care of me. good places to work are out there, and i hope that you can find one of those places."
e46,eyhzy1u,t1_eyhzo2f,1567095378.0,thank you !
e46,eyewm02,t1_eydzid5,1567040047.0,"the original owner kept a log of all the work that he had done, and according to that, he had the brake pads replaced in 2016."
pickcrafter,eyd92y8,t3_cwcpwk,1567013818.0,"mine did that with the the z symbol, and this doesn't help much, but eventually it just started working. i tried drawing it in a bunch of different ways, but it never worked until after they updated the app. it was extremely aggravating though because it always made me lose against the boss. sorry about it :( i wish i could help more"
e46,eyd8qv1,t1_eyd8cjx,1567013597.0,thanks ! i'm still learning when it comes to this stuff so i appreciate it.
e46,eyd8jjw,t1_eyd8d9t,1567013467.0,i guess it's time to weld the diff :)
e46,eyd84ck,t1_eyd7lqc,1567013195.0,"cool thank you. i'm going to get that done as soon as i'm able to. if anything, it'll just be for the peace of mind, since i get worried to drive the car with the lights on, even if they're not indicative of a serious problem."
e46,eyd7d4f,t1_eyd5oxj,1567012703.0,check engine light too right ?
e46,eyd7ab2,t1_eyd2z4z,1567012650.0,yeah it's gotta be something with my sensors. the lights just turned off again on my drive home...
e46,eyd6trb,t1_eyd4620,1567012349.0,i think it's just the angle of the picture. hopefully haha because the radiator was replaced in 2015.
e46,etvb77t,t1_etv2sw4,1563230860.0,Awesome ! I'll have to go out and do all that tomorrow. Thanks for taking the time to help.
e46,etsl5rh,t1_ets83kw,1563148518.0,Cool thanks ! I've been looking into those recently. Are they fairly straightforward to use ?
e46,etpjyf4,t1_etpan4m,1563057482.0,that's the way to do it for sure. plus the oil changes are really easy if you have the right stuff hah
e46,etoxsz0,t1_etotqsa,1563040377.0,thanks lol i definitely learned my lesson
e46,etoqey4,t1_etooq4f,1563034856.0,thank you !! it's hellrot red :)
e46,etoq7cx,t1_etoo903,1563034696.0,"we tried, but the person who last changed the oil tightened it to the point where we couldn't get it off"
e46,etcbb02,t1_etbhpw3,1562680596.0,"speaking of which, my trunk handle was broken so i went to a junkyard to find one, and all i could find was a black one. i'll have to reconsider painting it red :)"
e46,eris5nr,t1_eriro4v,1560905792.0,yeah u right
e46,eriptbt,t1_erh8bah,1560904018.0,it's tempting lol but i couldn't do it. i love that car waaay too much
