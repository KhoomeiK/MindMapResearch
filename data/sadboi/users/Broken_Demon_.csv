depression,fq6vgbj,t1_fq6v6fh,1589138359.0,You will be too hopefully👍👍
depression,fq6uphe,t1_fq6ulsa,1589138084.0,"Don’t worry it happened ages ago, I’m good."
depression,fq6t4h3,t3_ggszno,1589137513.0,I was outcasted by my mum when she found one of my old suicide notes and treated me like I don’t even exist. Even though we were a rich family she smithed me by getting a cheep apartment for me to leave home to. It’s honestly funny at this point.
BlackClover,fpi9p9m,t1_fpfm8x4,1588636471.0,Oh yeah that’s what I forgot
BlackClover,fpew5d4,t3_gc4zee,1588556242.0,Well we do know that asta’s family have protected the spade nations royal family which yuno is from. This does present the question whether asta is also from a royal house in the spade kingdom or if he is the peasant that he already is working as servants for yuno’s family. Personally I believe in the latter of the 2 but it is still plausible that he could also be from one too.
BlackClover,fpevnhg,t3_gciqzh,1588555933.0,The show has been delayed so the episodes will still come out just at a slower pace. It is actually useful for them as a lot of the OG fans who left are starting to get back into it because of isolation.
depression,fpemv8l,t1_foz4q4m,1588550623.0,I would happily accept a hug right now. As long as I know there are parents who don’t act like mine did then I can rest assured that not all people who have had to resort to attempted suicide as an almost ‘last resort’ get rejected by the only people they have in life. What just really annoys me about that though was that I was a kid then; so to have their mother or father (who are often their kids idols) completely reject them just pisses me off really. Nice to see that people like you are on here to look out for their children too👍👍
depression,fozfreu,t1_fozerjy,1588189911.0,Whoops I kinda just wrote down everything🤭🤭.i haven’t really spoken in detail about this before so I kind of just let loose I guess but it helps to write all your experiences too if you want to get over it
depression,fozerjy,t1_fozdhp4,1588189438.0,"Don’t worry I’ve had depression for a long time now and have gotten over it completely now. There is no need to be sorry for something that couldn’t be helped and instead we should just continue moving forward. I remember looking into it on google when I used to debate telling her and just by how your parents act, you can kinda tell if they will take it bad or not. It was obvious mine wasn’t going to take it well since I was basically treated like I never existed. Idk if it’s happened to you but if you have been doing the whole wrist cuts and shit and your parents have seen it, you obviously want to hide it by saying you just scratched it but if they take no notice to it then I’m sorry to say that they will most likely just reject you like me. On the other hand they can make a big deal about it, which at the time is quite stressful as they don’t know about your depression, but after you have told them you probably realise that it was obvious that they were going to accept it and wish you said something sooner. If it’s obvious they will just laugh and say shit like ‘why aren’t you happy?’ or ‘just be happy’ you need to prepare for it. When it happened I don’t even know if the redit was around but it is now so make sure you post here if it takes a turn for the worst. It’s obviously best to talk to people going through the same thing. Depending on how they treat you will determine the outcome, that’s all I can say."
depression,foxwhf6,t1_foxwbci,1588158643.0,There’s no helping what’s already happened so I just have to find new people even though yeah it would have been nice to have her support when it started but I’m fine without it now
depression,foxw5q0,t1_foxvdxy,1588158340.0,Yeah I’ve found people who understand me better than my family and the reddit helps too.
depression,foxv47l,t1_foxv2gq,1588157322.0,Well it’s really a 50/50 chance whether parents with accept you or reject you and I guess I’m just unlucky
depression,foxq9fi,t3_ga09qc,1588152478.0,One time my mom found one of mine and literally just laughed in my face saying stuff like what’s wrong with you and just be happy which was easy for her to say as my family is extremely wealthy but I got cast out and got this crappy apartment instead.
depression,fnm0ga6,t1_fnm091t,1587062924.0,I really depends on your will power to how long you are actually in there because if you are determined to get out it won’t actually feel that long but if you just give up every day passes but it just feel like an eternity
depression,fnlzcw0,t1_fnlz1io,1587062380.0,Well from all the stories I’ve read about them you slowly lose track of time and most people who come to visit you slowly stop coming. Then you start forgetting stuff about what happened before you went into the coma and start to like make up stuff about your history which is usually dependant on like your personality
depression,fnltic1,t3_g2dpjn,1587059459.0,For some reason I have this complex where I wish I fell into a like 10 year coma and idk why but in like all of the stories you hear about them you can like still hear everything around you and for some reason it just sounds so good
depression,fnkmr4z,t3_g29t81,1587033018.0,Mostly everyone here hates who they are and how they act. I was in an argument with this prick for reasons and at the end I just thought to myself ‘No wonder why everyone hates me.’ I can just remember how I was like acting like such an asshole and I can’t help it. Even when I’m with my closest friend I still can’t help but act like a prick but he knows what’s going on with me so he don’t care
depression,fnkluxi,t3_g1wr6o,1587032034.0,"It’s really 50/50 for wether your parents will accept it or be against it. But now that you’ve told them, you’ve built up all of your confidence and courage and they’ve scolded you, you might have lost your confidence so just keep your confidence up I know it’s easier said than done but you have to."
depression,fngs6u2,t1_fngrob2,1586942978.0,"I got rid of my phone but my depression actually got worse so I got a new one and joined this reddit and I am sooo glad I did because I’m this day and age, if you have depression ,personally, I have a really hard time talking to people in the real world so this Reddit is has really helped me because everyone is anonymous and yet we still help each other out and stuff."
depression,fngrz6n,t3_g1jxci,1586942753.0,Are they not the same thing?? That’s one of the things I feel anyway.
depression,fn06jcz,t1_fmzkwqj,1586536338.0,This is actually so helpful that I’m screenshoting  it in case there’s a time I might need it
depression,fn06e9r,t3_fydfd0,1586536264.0,At this point when you are in constant grief and feel tremendous loss of your parents there is no one stopping you from ending it all. Just know that you can get better in many different ways trust me it’s from experience... we are all in it together so take our word for it.
depression,fn04rgn,t1_fn04klo,1586535437.0,Thanks that’s great to hear. Hope you get on this road soon
depression,fmylfr6,t1_fmyl8hg,1586489036.0,I’ve been living with quite severe depression for 8 years now but I only got a psychiatrist 2 years ago. I’m not the richest so she’s not the best out there but I slowly feel improvements from time to time.
depression,fmxk489,t1_fmxjxz4,1586466489.0,"When we already feel dead inside, I’m not sure about others because I’m not good with talking to people, but it’s just reassuring that eventually we will be granted death and that it’s just a matter of time."
depression,fmxjb3b,t1_fmx9pn6,1586466050.0,That’s what we all feel and ask ourselves... your not in this alone
depression,fmxiz9c,t1_fmxitpl,1586465874.0,"Exactly, it’s just the sweet release of all of the the pain and suffering I’ve held with me for 8 years"
depression,fmx6j0p,t1_fmx5670,1586459361.0,All I can think about is death. I have been at it for around 8 years now though.
depression,fmx6fsp,t1_fmx4y2q,1586459313.0,It takes years but yes you can get better
depression,fmx6b5d,t3_fxu3r5,1586459247.0,I agree but it’s more like the preparation for death. People with it are ready to die and people without it are unable to understand the concept of death itself. That’s  just what I think though.
depression,fmsvzyn,t3_fx1mos,1586362866.0,"Even if it looks like your going nowhere in life, even if everyone is telling you that you are going nowhere, even if no one gives a single shit about you, you have to create a path for you to go on. From experience it’s quite lonely and I’m not one to talk about relationships because I’m guessing other people are in the same boat as me with people not wanting a relationship with such a lowlife like me but, I hope I will meet someone on this path of mine that is in the same situation as me and I hope you and everyone reading this does too. From the way you said you have been hiding your feelings for 5 years, you are probably quite experienced with being alone but you just have to hope you will find someone; I have for around 8 years and I won’t give up so you shouldn’t either."
depression,fm35eoq,t1_fm357v7,1585713329.0,I guess that’s the best option really as the last thing I want is to get into an argument
depression,fm35a2h,t1_fm353q3,1585713233.0,Yeah there’s only like 3 people I actually consider friends but everyone just can’t seem to understand that I’ve been through so much shit that I only just started going out last month.
