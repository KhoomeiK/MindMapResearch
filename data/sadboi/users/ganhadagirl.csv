I hear you on the subject of not being ""a dating type"".  When I was 18, I overheard my boss and my trainer -who both gave me many compliments- say I was the kind of girl you might hang out with, but not one they wanted to date.  It wrecked my confidence for a long time.  

Also, there are plenty of people looking for a 'teddy bear', especially if your friend described you that way because you make her feel comfortable and safe.  Please, be you.  It can be detrimental to you and to any future partners oyf you decide to fake who you are for companionship.  That isn't to keep you from trying new things.  Instead, it's an invitation to share your genuine feelings and responses.  If something isn't for you, it's okay to say so.  It's also okay to support people doing things you don't enjoy.

Say a friend or date loves ice hockey.  I'd you try it and you don't like it, it's good to say so and it's good to support their continued support of the things they like.  

I'm glad you're social.  I hope you get to know a bunch of people.  I hope you dedicate time to the company you enjoy, especially the people who allow you feel comfortable being your authentic self and the people who are comfortable being their authentic selves arrive you.  While you don't have to share hobbies to date someone, there are plenty of people from all genders who enjoy cars and video games and video editing.

There's no pressure to date by a certain age.  I started going on dates at 16, and I had my first serious partner at 19.  We broke up after a year, and I didn't date again until I was 23.  

During that time, I went dancing, I hung out with friends, I had some crushes, and I enjoyed life.  I married at 24, maybe too young, as it didn't work out well. 

I think the best thing you can do is get to know yourself. Try stuff that interests you.  Pay attention to what you enjoy, what makes you uncomfortable in a way that pushes you to grow, and what feels wrong to you. Learn to honor yourself, your voice, your choices, and your limits.  Learn to have a healthy relationship with you.  That will strengthen your ability to have healthy relationships with other people, including friendships, dating, and professional relationships. 

If you want company, seek it. If you find you don't like it, it's okay to change your mind.

I reached out to my landlord about updating the lease and, late Christmas eve, I got permission from landlord to add a pet deposit(!), but I didn't have a cat anymore.  My kids got some cat toys for Christmas, and the ""gift"" was we are allowed to get a cat now. . .
