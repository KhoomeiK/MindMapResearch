In terms of the veneers, that makes sense, just with the length and price of invisalign i was hoping for them to be completely straight after and then the touch ups, so as if they were to fall off or something in the future I wouldn't be left with gaps until they could be replaced. I dont know much about composite veneers really, I'm just a natural worrier Haha"

He did mention that I would benefit from botox injections to lower my lip too, but as it's not really a permanent solution I'm apprehensive to do this. 

As the gum contouring would hopefully make me happier with my smile anyway. 

I'm not being referred, it's in part of my treatment plan after veneers and invisalign, and it's a cosmetic dentist that will do it all for me."
