UnresolvedMysteries,fkoifjl,t1_fk2ejmn,1584387855.0,">The Baeder-Meinhoff phenomenon makes sense if detached feet with exposed bones were common findings all over the world.

Only one foot had exposed bones out of the 21 (as far as I've seen, and I've seen photos of most of them). Can you explain why you say it doesn't make sense? Not saying I disagree, it's just reading your comment I'm trying to figure out if you and I share the same understanding of what Frequency Illusion is.

Also... my research tells me that it does indeed happen all over the world. Constantly. [Check out this news video](https://globalnews.ca/video/rd/1440943171508/?jwsource=cl). Particularly timestamp 1:45 where one of the researchers over [the pig carcass](https://youtu.be/PnV8sYAEKuU?t=1729) speaks about the frequency they hear of feet washing up on shore from their colleagues around the world. Only difference is that... it hasn't been newsworthy. I think the only thing that makes this case unique is that the news created a kind of perfect storm of sensationalizing the findings while simultaneously downplaying how mundane of an occurrence it actually is.

One more for good measure, CTV News interviewed Dr Lynne Bell, a Physical Anthropologist who also said the essentially the same thing, that [""it does happen on other coastlines around the world, it's not unusual.""](https://youtu.be/jUGM3GA-DlQ?t=65)

>No, despite your great job OP, you havent find any solution

First of all, thanks! Never claimed that the conclusion I came to (which I got from elsewhere and agreed with, along with the experts in the field of physical anthropology, behavioral scientists, and law enforcement) made the most sense to me. If you have a better explanation than those guys, let me know. I'm just a guy that Googles shit and makes videos about it haha

>I never heard of human feet detached from bodies gathering in the same area.

Not sure if you're saying what it appears to me that you're saying, but something not happening simply because you personally haven't heard of it is flawed reasoning.

>if you put an empty shoe in a crowded area nobody's gonna give a damn,

I came to the same conclusion at the end when I demonstrated that at the end. Left a shoe out, no one cared. Again it wasn't scientific, but when I asked them if they had noticed the shoe after hearing stories in the news that feet had been washing up on shore found inside shoes, they would have had a much different reaction. Granted, behavior people exhibit when observed vs intended behavior declared under a hypothetical circumstance tends to vary wildly... but like I said in the video and the post... ""take it with a grain of salt"".

>but put some exposed bones (like the pic you posted) and you May get a totally different reaction by passersby

Again, only one shoe I know of had exposed bones. And that was the 18th shoe. 17 others had washed up before that one.

The main conclusion I came to using the Baeder-Meinhoff phenomenon is that (again, I have no proof, this is just a theory that seems to fit in my mind) this is occurring at a rate it always has, but because someone noticed and it ended up in the news, people on the beach became increasingly hyper-aware of stray shoes found, when under any other circumstance they would simply ignore a random shoe on the beach and not show any interest in it.

Normal:

>""Huh, a shoe. Someone left a shoe behind. Moving on.""

News reports in the area about feet washing up on shore inside shoes:

>""Holy shit, could it be a foot? I've been hearing about this! I should check it out and see if it is one!""

Again, I don't have proof that the conclusion I came to is the right one, it's just the most likely explanation in my mind. Would love to know if you have a better explanation! Especially if you can use some examples or sources to back up what you come up with, because although I researched this pretty heavily, there's bound to be stuff I may have missed that would have been material to this case.

UnresolvedMysteries,fk0tpsl,t1_fjx3a5g,1583765936.0,"I appreciate the encouragement. While his criticism is harsh, I'm glad he said it. I took a step back and realized in my excitement about sharing my findings, I was rambling and giving all sorts of extra unnecessary info that detracted from the post itself. And yes, I definitely incurred expenses, and while yes my channel is monetized, my expenses for this will probably always far outweigh anything back I make from ad revenue or even the sponsor for the video (which I might not even get paid for at the end of the day). 

What was important to me is that while he was the only one who had voiced concerns so far, everyone's opinion is representative of someone else who probably feels the exact same way, but chose not to say something, which might explain why this post didn't really take off like others that I've done. Every time I post, it shoots up to at least 2-3k upvotes with multiple awards (the David Parker Ray one is sitting at just a few hundred upvotes because the original one got removed - a misunderstanding surrounding the original version led to it getting removed after it hit about 2.5k). This one has just kinda flopped unfortunately and I suspect it's because either it's just not that interesting to people here as it is to me, or I came across as too self-promoty when I first posted it."
UnresolvedMysteries,fk0sswc,t1_fjp9otz,1583765351.0,"I will add that victim advocacy is something I'm very passionate about. If you take a look at the David Parker Ray post that I did, especially, I took an absolutely horrendous individual and set of crimes he committed and made it as much as I could about telling the stories about the victims. In those type of posts and content, you can't tell their stories without telling about the criminal who inflicted suffering on them, but in absolutely no way do I glorify the crimes or the criminal. The worst thing that I see some content creators doing is approach these crimes in an exploitative way, covering it like a low-budget grind house horror. **These are real people** who didn't have a choice to be part of this story and it's important to approach it with empathy and respect for people whose lives were changed or ended because of the selfish acts of a psychopath."

I took a step back, looked at the post, and I could definitely see how it came across from your perspective, and there's absolutely a non-zero chance that others felt the same, but just hadn't decided to be vocal about it yet. 

I removed everything that seemed unnecessary. I left the links to the other posts I've done here, but deleted links to the videos themselves. I deleted the references to music, I removed the disclaimers, everything but the links to previous mysteries I've looked into and the text itself. 

I do want to address how you mentioned that this was simply copying / pasting the script and hitting post. These posts I do in here are a lot of effort on my part, so I don't want you to get he impression I'm being lazy. Yes I ""copy and paste"" the script, but it goes into a separate Google Doc first, I spend about 2-3 hours reformatting everything for readability, digging through all the resources I found to make my doc, adding them to a hidden imgur album, and then inserting links to sources, relevant images, etc. It's pretty high effort, at least I feel ilke it is. I spend a bit of time rewording things as well that I think sound better spoken but sound better when read.

I also add a bit of extra information and context in here that I didn't include in the doc, so you actually get MORE by reading this rather than watching it.

You do sound like you've made up your mind about my intentions, but I really do want to make sure it's said that while OF COURSE I would love for these to result in more traffic to a video I spent so much of my life and effort making, my primary priority is to give people here something to read that I find really interesting and I'm passionate about. I'll be far more careful in the future, I promise. Me making these posts is how I got started making content, and I do it because I'm passionate and excited about what I work so hard at. First and foremost, this is a passion and a hobby, not my livelihood. Yes my channel is monetized, and yes I make between $30 - $60 a month on advertising revenue on my channel, but making this is also not cheap. But even if I wasn't monetized, and made literally nothing from this, I would still do it.

Sorry for the novel, and maybe I dug myself deeper, I don't know. I just felt like you deserved an explanation since you seemed the most vocal about how I came across and I felt bad. Hope you can at least enjoy the read, and have a good weekend."

Part of me thinks that Monticello Canyon near truth or consequences is one of the burial grounds since that’s where they took the body of Marie Parker with Roy Yancy, but it might not be one of the locations since when Roy lead investigators to the spot that they had dumped her body, David had apparently gone back after they left and relocated her remains somewhere else."

This irredeemable psychopath is an anomaly to the human gene pool. I wouldn't spend too much time trying to ""understand"" him becaause his brain is just not wired in a frame of reference you or I can understand.

>And I can't help but to think about his daughter. Did she grow up watching him torture women?

Yes

>Did she started to like it then?

I think after the FBI closed the case on her complaint against him, she gave up trying to walk the straight and narrow and fully embraced the only family she had and not only came to terms with it, but dove head-first into the deep end after this.

>Was that some sort of trauma bonding?

I'm no psychologist or expert, but it wouldn't surprise me if that was the case.

>When she went to the police was she not involved yet and knew it was wrong?

She saw this behavior almost her whole life from her father. I gather that it wasn't until she was in her late teens that she started to truly understand that not only was this behavior not normal, but criminal.

>So the police doing nothing was what pushed her over the edge to join in her father's crimes?

That seems to be the prevailing theory.

>Was she always a monster inside?

I'm an incurable optimist. I don't believe anyone is born a monster. We all start as pure innocent little children. We are shaped by our experiences and environment, but I hold that no matter what foundation our adulthood is built upon, we all make our own choices and should be accountable to whatever life we've led.

>⁠why isn’t DPR more known?

I’m dead serious when I say I think the biggest reason is because his crimes are so heinous and so despicable and hard to stomach that nobody really likes to talk about it. You can talk about almost any serial killer because there’s a sellable hook to the story, something Hollywood could use, The topics covered in his life and crimes are so abhorrent, I can understand why nobody ever touches the stuff with a 40 foot pole. Lots of people here in the comments could barely even read through the post and many couldn’t stomach the documentary that I made.

>how many victims do you think he had? 

Between 40 and 60

>Why wasn’t more done?

I think there are a lot of reasons, one of which is I think he did a pretty thorough job of covering his tracks, evidenced by the fact that no one has ever been able to find a single body. I think what he was doing was so horrendous and unbelievable that it makes it hard to actually believe it could be true. Just imagine someone telling you that they think somebody built a custom torture chamber and spent $100,000 in it and they use it to hold captive women that they’ve kidnapped for months at a time. That’s so bad shit insane that I would never believe it if there wasn’t proof that it happened

>Besides the list, what was the piece of information that will stay with you?

The stuff that will stay with me is the stuff that I didn’t even cover in this because it was so absolutely insane and dehumanizing that I would prefer to not have ever learned it in the first place so I really don’t want to repeat it.

UnresolvedMysteries,faggt7l,t1_fagfrsf,1576054107.0,"Different tapes. The tapes that caused that guy to vomit was the video tapes that he had of himself torturing women. The audio tape is the one that he played for his victims as an orientation to the ordeal they were about to face.

Playing the audiotape was absolutely instrumental in convicting him, and one of the reasons the first trial ended up with a hung jury was because the judge would not allow the tape to be played. The tape demonstrated the absolute depravity and extent to which he caused so much damage to his victims or physically and psychologically. It’s one of the most effective ways to drive home how horrid his crimes were, evidenced by the fact that it’s the first thing anyone brings up when they talk about David Parker Ray."

UnresolvedMysteries,faggm8o,t1_fagfnkp,1576053814.0,"I don’t know what the autopsy results were if they performed one. I mentioned in another comment that one of the things that was so crazy about the trial was that he had a serious history of heart issues and they were exacerbated allegedly by the stress of the trial. He had about five instances I counted in my research of near heart attacks. 

I will say plainly that if evidence were ever brought that he somehow committed suicide by inducing a heart attack it would surprise me. It seems pretty apparent that he was already at a point where he was at a very high risk of heart attack. He also was extremely mum in a press interview just a few days before his death when he wasn’t willing to talk about something specific involved in his plea agreement because he evidently had things to share that he was planning on divulging to them. If he was planning on committing suicide, he wouldn’t have really had much incentive to be discreet about anything."

David Parker Ray and Jessie Ray both felt like the first trial only went their way first time around because of the judge and that they got “screwed“ with the new judge in the second trial because he actually allowed evidence.

UnresolvedMysteries,fagbaxp,t1_fag7a65,1576046751.0,"I don’t think strict parenting is comparable to his upbringing. It was constant physical abuse, neglect, alcoholism, and no parental bonds. I do agree that you can’t blame someone’s choices ENTIRELY on their childhood, but I do believe that constant childhood trauma can play a role in a developing psyche. But to further back up your point, his younger sister Peggy had the same upbringing (though her being female possibly saved her from a lot of the physical abuse - pure speculation as well) and she didn’t murder anyone... that we know of.

If you take the stance though and say that an abusive upbringing has no bearing on the child in adulthood, what effect does a healthy loving and stable upbringing have if any?"

UnresolvedMysteries,fagaad3,t1_fag9ulg,1576045586.0,"I think the fact that he cut them open exposed a lot of their bodies and they decomposed faster in the water. I don’t think it was a case of crazy man eating catfish tearing into flesh and stuff like that. I think the longer the body is underwater, the softer tissue becomes. Just my speculation though.

UnresolvedMysteries,fag64vw,t1_fag5x7t,1576041389.0,"According to Cindy Hendy, he had 3 burial grounds spread across New Mexico and Arizona. I have to assume that includes Elephant Butte Lake. Part of me thinks somewhere around Monticello Canyon, but I have doubts, considering that's simply where he led Roy Yancy to to dump the body and then he seemingly moved the body at a later time to wherever he normally hid them / fed to catfish.

EDIT: I feel like I should clarify. Cindy Hendy said 3 burial grounds (pretty sure that was the number), but I doubt David told her about a few others... or possibly gave her false info in the event she was ever squeezed by police. Really sucks because part of his plea agreement was that he would cooperate and tell investigators where bodies were it seemed like but he died before they started working with him."

UnresolvedMysteries,fag5px3,t1_fag3vas,1576041026.0,"I mentioned that the trial could very well be its own piece.

DPR had a history of heart problems and they were exacerbated by (allegedly) the stress of the trial. He had 5 distinct instances during the pretrial and trial where he had near heart attacks. It got to the point that they had medics on standby and he had oxygen tanks next to him as well.

The first trial for his kidnap and torture of Kelli Van Cleave ended up a mistrial with a hung jury. 2 jurors held out. The fucking judge didn't even question it or ask the jury to go back and deliberate some more. He just threw his hands up, declared a mistrial and went home to watch MASH.

Three things about the first trial
* AC was not working and it was sweltering, up to 90 degrees in the court room. No one wanted to be there.
* DPR's health problems very likely garnered sympathy from the 2 jurors who held out on a guilty verdict.
* The fucking judge wouldn't allow the tape to be played as evidence.

Long story short, the second trial they got him and he was found guilty... well... he knew he would be found guilty so he pled guilty to get Jesse out of trouble. Prosecutors should have never accepted the plea agreement.

To answer your question, he had a heart attack and died the day he got to his actual prison."

UnresolvedMysteries,fag1t3i,t1_fag18dh,1576037692.0,"Keep in mind the FBI resources are pretty limited and while I am not aware of any concerted efforts currently, they resurrect this case every few years or so like they did in 2011 in an attempt to identify victims. My speculation is that there's not much that can be done with a consistent effort, but the results will likely be found with big pushes every few years or so like they seem to do. Time has a way of revealing new information so it's probably best to cast your net once in awhile instead of just sit in the boat with your net in the water when you're not getting any fish.

probably a terrible analogy."
UnresolvedMysteries,fafyvcq,t1_fafybr3,1576035407.0,"You definitely seem more knowledgeable about the drug aspect than I do so I can’t really comment on what he should have done to gain the effect desired, but from all my research, what I can tell you is that the brainwashing began the moment they were brought home. They were humiliated, tortured for hours, etc. The relentless torture for hours on end as soon as they were introduced into their new environment was considered crucial by him to set the tone and the expectations of what to expect and to ensure total and complete compliance and submission. He did it with electric shocks to change their actual thought processes. Anything out of line was met with an electric shock. Quick, but painful. This continued the entire time they were in captivity.

What I can tell you is that while I’m no expert in drug administration or psychological manipulation, all of the research that I did told me that the drugs specifically sodium pentothal and phenobarbital were administered at the very end as part of the process of disposing of them. They did not want them drugged during their sessions because they did not want anything to deaden the pain or their fear.

P.S. when I say they were humiliated as part of their initial torture, I am extremely reluctant to tell you how much I’m sugarcoating that. There are things he did to them that I will never get out of my brain. He did things to them that were so dehumanizing and humiliating all in an effort to ensure complete control, compliance, and submission. By the end, it’s very likely that many of his victims were convinced that he truly was their master and that they were an animal and lost all humanity"
