When I was first diagnosed for a while I didn't feel depressed and my feelings weren't overwhelming me. I wasnt on any medication but since Christmas I've been on anti depressants and went to therapy twice which just didn't help and made me feel worse. I just try to keep taking my pills and hope that helps 😊"
