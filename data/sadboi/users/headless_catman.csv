I was driving down one of the streets in my neighbourhood and this guy is moving really slowly (like 20km in a 50km zone) and on the curb. I slowed down because I wasn't sure what he was doing. I assumed he was looking for a house (as his speed and location on the road suggested) and I ended up trying to safely pass. This guy cuts sharply up, cutting off my car and starts yelling. So whatever, go ahead dick head. He starts break checking me. I'm far enough away where I'm not even pressing the gas or break.. Just coasting. Buddy ended up going into reverse so I said fuck this I'm out of here. I end up going around him and he tries to run me off the road. At the stop sign I got him to stop and yell at me so I took off trying to lose this psycho following me. So I pull into the local plaza as there are cameras and people because he won't stop following me. So he blocks me and gets out of the car and tries to open my door. It's locked and I'm on the phone with 911. He ends up taking off. I got his plate and the cops gave him huge shit since there's videos and such. Seriously, so scary people out there. All because he's driving dangerously slow and being an ass."

If you are able to sit on it, think about it, and figure out a way to eventually articulate it to your family when you are ready is not cowardly.

It's similar to coming out of the closet to religious parents. It's scary, life altering and a huge decision that takes time. You're not coming out of the homosexual closet, but you are coming out of your own closet. And that's hard, so don't be so hard on yourself.

Hamilton,fqdgmc3,t3_gi8vzl,1589289228.0,"If you see smoke this is what to look for if you're concerned:

If the smoke is black and heavy, solid almost in colour, call 911. That is most likely a building or some sort of synthetic material in flames.

If it's grey/dark grey, it's probably a bon fire or some natural material burning. So if you're alone in a forest.. Call 911.. Otherwise it's probably nothing. Especially if there isn't a lot.

If it's white or translucent, it's probably a huge amount of steam being released. Smoke tends to not be white because of the different chemical reactions with the flames. Steam is just hot water vapour.

My dad used to be a fire captain with Hamilton Fire and gave me this walkthrough years ago. This will help to know if you need to call 911 or not."

I'm also glad you're able to see the truth you need to see. Just know, leaving the church was a loss to you. You lost family, friends, a lifestyle, a community and much more. Grieving is not linear nor is it time constricted. Time is man made, grief is not. Let the grief come and go as it needs, and don't be so hard on yourself when you feel it (no matter the time that's passed), you've lost a lot. Always try to be thankful for what you have and don't forget to grieve and feel the pain of loss. This is losing that last piece of who you THOUGHT you were.

Not that I believed in God, however my church was very focused on building people and children up, so I enjoyed the community. So that's what I imagine the only pro could be.

Just in a follow up, since you don't go to church, does your family react negatively to that? Are you an adult or minor? Does the church pressure your family?

And that's interesting they condemn polygamy, considering that was one of the original issues with LDS becoming a religion back in the day (since Christianity stated one man and one woman).

Do you still believe in God? Not necessarily in the way the church has taught you, but do you have a belief system or have you become more agnostic?

If you'd rather me DM you these questions (cause they are kind of personal), I totally can. I just figured in case there are any other outsiders looking in, this might help with some things they want to know as well.

The concierge did the right thing. Call the police so they are on their way while they fight him off. A weapon would've taken someone's life. Both women got away safely, the assailant was arrested and is now in prison receiving the psychiatric care he needs. He's exactly where he should be and those women are safe.

The colour is good but the size not too much... And the hair colour is what's killing me.. Not for her. But if you are lucky enough to have and pull off full brows.. Rock it!"
