relationship_advice,fjl3zll,t1_fjk7mq6,1583439486.0,"It really won't make a difference if you're married or not when it comes to getting a mortgage. The only exception I can think of, off the top of my head, is that with a VA loan, only a spouse can take title along with the borrower. But it doesn't sound like either of you are veterans anyway.

When you apply for a mortgage, you can apply jointly whether or not you are married. The lender will take the lowest of either of your middle credit scores (so, when your report is pulled, for example, your scores may come back at 675, 700, and 705. 700 being the middle, and you wife/partner/co-applicant's comes back at 580, 600, and 601. 600 is her middle and the lender would use 600 to determine pricing). If you apply jointly, then you get to use both applicants' income, but you must also include their debts and credit scores. It would be a conversation to have with a mortgage broker to determine which option is best. :)

Other than insurance, another aspect of getting married, would be that you would each be next of kin. Depending on the state, you would have rights when it comes to hospitalization, etc. I would definitely discuss that with Claire and make sure you each know what the other wants. It's a heavy conversation but one that needs to be had.

Good luck! <3"

I guess I was speaking more of humans torturing animals, that sort of thing. It's why I definitely couldn't be an animal control officer or work for the SPCA, that sort of thing. I know I probably won't be able to avoid that entirely, but that would probably be the most difficult aspect for me. 

I've always loved the outdoors, and #5 made me laugh! Sounds much better than being stuck in a stuffy, windowless office for the rest of my life.

    B) This is sad. It sounds like this career is more a labor of love. 
3. I agree about the math, it's immensely intimidating but I am confident if I hire a tutor and put all my effort into it, I can get through it. 
4. You share everyone else's opinions on this. While I would love to be able to choose my species, as long as it isn't bugs I'll be ok! My main objective is to help species survive!
5. I'm introverted as hell, which is why I think I'm going to force myself into an apt. with a roommate, as well as make myself network, since it's that important to this field. 

I Google'd how to sex a beaver. Interesting. Luckily, I'm not too bad with animal body fluids and such (can't take humans though). What I absolutely CAN'T handle is animal suffering. I hope this field doesn't see much, if any of that?

Check out PyschologyToday.com to search for therapists in your area. You can filter them by insurance provider, as well as other options such as gender, issues, and religious preference. 

After you find some, then search them on Google. Read reviews, see if they do work within their community too. 

After you've narrowed it down, simply call and ask if they're accepting new patients. The receptionist may ask a little bit about your issues, but you don't have to go into much detail with her. Really, all you need to say is that you're feeling some depression and anxiety, and you'd like some help navigating through it. 

Once you have your first appointment, prepare yourself by taking the time to write a list of things you're feeling. Also write down some questions you may have for the therapist. If you're like me, when you get to the first appointment, you'll forget everything and be glad you have that piece of paper!

See how you vibe with this therapist. Do they make you feel comfortable enough to be open and honest with them? They should be willing to listen to you, and be gentle and accepting. 

I hope this helps :) Good luck!"

I definitely plan on volunteering as much as possible while in school, to help out and to get as much diverse experience as possible. 

The toxic personalities is a little scary. As someone with personal baggage that I'm dealing with, I tend to gravitate towards toxic relationships.

What sort of bureaucratic issues do you deal with? I have worked for major corporate companies such as Wells Fargo and Wal-Mart, and my biggest issue with those companies was the blatantly obvious manner in which they cared about their people. I imagine a government job is the same? Do you have good benefits though?

How would I get more experience with the computer programs? Are there college courses for that?

It figures that wolves are the most popular. Rabbits are my favorite animal so I could try for that, but honestly what I want to do at my core is study and help mammals in a forest setting.

See how you vibe with the therapist. Do you feel comfortable enough to open up and be honest with them? Do they share a similar belief system? (ie you may not prefer a religious therapist or faith-based therapy if you are atheist). See how you feel after your first or second session. 

For me, a few of my first therapists seemed more concerned about making sure I was able to pay. That was a huge turn off. Another one I had was determined for me to see God's purpose in everything, and I am strongly agnostic and anti-organized religion, so that was a turn off too.

therapy,fixj4qv,t1_fio7o1u,1582821302.0,"So, this therapist specializes in Rapid Resolution Therapy, which is different than talk therapy, for example. Basically, the subconscious brain is stuck and reacting to trauma from the past. This form of therapy is supposed to skip over the conscious brain (which can be reasoned with) and tell the subconscious brain that the trauma is no longer happening. 

I was originally searching for a psychologist when I found her. She is a licensed clinical social worker, an army veteran, and has a BA in Psychology. What really drew me to her was all of the work she does with veterans and PTSD outside of her practice. While I am not a veteran, this made me feel like she truly cares about people. 

I don't know anything about you and I'm not a professional, so unfortunately I don't know where you should start. But, I was exhibiting symptoms of depression, anxiety, hopelessness, etc. from past trauma. And, while I am not 100% healed, I felt quite a difference after seeing her just once. She did tell me that a psychologist would be way more expensive (I have no insurance, so self pay) and would take longer than her form of therapy. After talking with her more, she also told me that I would personally benefit from a life coach too.  I am excited to continue to work on myself and see what I can become. I still have a lot of work to do and a lot of stuff to figure out. 

I'm sorry this probably doesn't help you that much. But, this is my observation."

Or, he could have thought you're GORGEOUS and he felt inferior to you. And instead of admitting that he was mean and cut you off. 

Either way, his loss!

offmychest,fgmei1q,t3_ez8fc9,1580922957.0,"I do this too. For me, I recognized that it's a defense mechanism for when things get tough. I look forward to going to bed so I can live in my fantasy for awhile before falling asleep. It's the first thing I think about upon waking. During exercise, I let my mind wander and it goes to my fantasy. 

What I'm having a hard time with, is my newest fantasy involves leaving my current relationship, and going back to school for a degree I would absolutely love to pursue. I struggle with, is this really a fantasy or do I want this? I've pictured the pros and cons of this new life, planned out schools, apartments, vehicles, scholarships, career opportunities. Not sure if I'm going to act on it yet though. 

Do you find that the daydreaming significantly increases at certain times? Maybe it is a subconscious defense mechanism for something. Can you talk to a therapist/counselor about it? I'm not sure how old you are, but most of the colleges I've looked at offer free therapy to their students."
