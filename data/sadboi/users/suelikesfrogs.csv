People voted for the NSDAP because they were promising a lot of good and people were still nationalists at the time. There was really nothing Germany could defend themselves from because like you said it was accepted.
I don't know why Germany is brought up in an American debate topic whilst facts are twisted. Its kind of disrespectful.
I wouldn't know of any particular instance the argument has actually succeeded, but Germany wouldn't have been it.
