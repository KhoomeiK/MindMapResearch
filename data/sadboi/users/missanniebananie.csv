now you are not obligated or required to by any means, to talk to this man, hang out with this man, or have any contact what so ever. he could be a malicious pos.

but to me it seems he wants you to have the best gay youth possible, giving you advice, trying to be a good queer role model. i think it‚Äôs sweet, but he‚Äôs not going about it in a way that makes you uncomfortable and that‚Äôs a huge no.

i‚Äôm 15 years old, i‚Äôm going to turn 16 in july. i suffer from major depression, anxiety disorder, and some form of anger issue (never been officially diagnosed, but have been prescribed temporary mood stabilizers, sorta like xanax) i also have a substance abuse issue with marijuana.

when i read your post, i genuinely for a second thought it could have been written by my mother. 

i looked at your other posts, and your son your talking about, Danny, is me around a year ago. i‚Äôm not saying Danny is going to be a depressed pot head like i am, but i really do think you need to find some way to get him treatment. it‚Äôs normal for kids to experiment, and honestly i was Danny, now i‚Äôm his shit head friend who got him high lmao. 

if i where you, i‚Äôd just tell him more or less this: ‚ÄúDanny, i love you very much, you are extremely important to me and i wouldn‚Äôt be the same without you in my life. i want you to be safe, it‚Äôs okay if you try things, but please do it safely. know that alcohol and marijuana are not immoral or bad things, but they aren‚Äôt completely good. it‚Äôs okay to try them every once and a while, but it‚Äôs hard to stop once you‚Äôve become codependent. i want you to be happy, and this behavior is normal, but i have the feeling that something may be a little wrong. i‚Äôm not going to ask you to tell me anything, and i‚Äôm not going to force you to go to therapy or go on medication, but please know, if you feel depressed, anxious, overly angry, or anything you feel isn‚Äôt how it should be; please tell me. i want you to be happy and healthy, and if that means sometimes you get high or drunk, that‚Äôs okay, but please if you feel that you need to do these things to escape your life, talk to me. i will always listen. i won‚Äôt judge you, i won‚Äôt argue, i won‚Äôt make you feel like you shouldn‚Äôt feel this way. and if i‚Äôve ever made you feel like you couldn‚Äôt talk to me because i would act like that, i‚Äôm so sorry. i love you and i know growing up really sucks, but i‚Äôm always here for you, and i‚Äôll do everything in my power to make sure you‚Äôre a happy kid.‚Äù"
