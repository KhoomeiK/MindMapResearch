As long as you play with friends every once in a while achieving red ranks is more than possible. Literally solo-que-ing might be harder, though.

tall,feeve99,t1_feeugsp,1579042041.0,"The reason not everyone thinks the way you think and those incel or shortcel forums are just a small community is because it simply isn't true. I have short friends, they have or have had girlfriends, my dad is shorter than my mom, blablabla. I bet you won't even believe me because you are so deeply imbedded in the belief that women ONLY WANT TALL MEN.
Most of them obviously prefer it but saying they ONLY want bigger men? Are you delusional? It's mindboggling.

And by the way: Why should anyone be entitled to love you? Nobody is entitled to be loved by anyone. No girl, whether she is fat, tall, skinny, short, tall, whatever, is entitled to tell me to love them. This goes for you aswell. So hating women for not wanting to fuck you is straight up idiotic.

Finally, I know you don't give a fuck about what I say. You will probably read this comment, maybe even reply to it, discuss this stuff, insult me, whatever - but you won't change your mind. You made your decision. So why bother discussing the topic at all? 
Just keep on living in your bubble, whine all day with those 6.500 jerky on r/shortcel about women being ""soooo mean"" and don't change."

Anxiety,f7b1g2s,t1_f7b14jd,1573550425.0,"Yes, the drug you described is in the same category as mine, it's a kind of SSRI (just Google it for quick info!) :)

So I feel like it is just like in my case - an anxiety inducing side effect. These medications are known for their intense side effects. 
Please talk to your doctor and either start taking them regularly or stop taking them.

Remember, I'm not a doctor, so I highly encourage to talk to one first! :)
And as said - talk to someone you trust. You are most likely absolutely fine. It will help you, I promise!

Good luck and remember: I had the SAME thing yesterday. Maybe read my post so you don't feel alone in the situation. :)"
Anxiety,f7b0r6h,t3_dv7d3a,1573549323.0,"Hey buddy! 

First of all, are you taking any kind of medication? I had exactly the same thing happen to me (see my latest post) due to the side effects of the SSRI's I was taking. 

Felt an intense sting in my chest, got a panic attack, felt like it got worse, got a worse panic attack, felt like I fainted due to a heart attack, etc. 

It helped so much to talk to my parents. I told them I felt like I was about to have a heart attack, even though I feel confident it's mostly in my head and has to do with medication. 

Talking about it with someone you trust can help so much. They will calm you down and be there in case something is really going on. Maybe go to your doctor and get a quick checkup? Just to get a medical opinion and feel more secure. 

I wish you only the best, my friend. :)
Remember, you're not alone!

Edit: spelling."

AskReddit,f0lbqgy,t3_d5bek2,1568709102.0,"I am 22 now and was diagnosed with depression and a social anxiety disorder 3 years ago. Before I was on medication I often imagined - very vividly - what an amazing and relaxing experience it would be to just let go off the steering wheel at 150km/h and let it all come to a an end. All the stress and the struggle and the suffering - just blown away. The thought was really calming and almost orgasmic in that specific moment.

Right now I feel disgusted when I think about my thoughts back then. But in a few days or weeks this might change and I might feel the exact same way again.

Similar to other posts, many people who have been suicidal or suffered from depression have a tendency to experience periodic depression, where it just naturally creeps up on you every few weeks or so for no apparent reason. 

It is so much easier to handle it when you know you got it, though, and when you have people who you can talk to.
Use the time where you feel better to really enforce your thoughts of disgust for the thoughts you have during the depression period, it really manifests itself in your brain and can really help you overcoming the next depression episode.

Long story short: 
1. I started to talk about it to people I care about and a therapist.

2. Medication, medication, medication 

3. When there are instances where you feel better: Try to manifest the thought of disgust for your suicidal thoughts during a depression episode. If you feel good for a longer period of time, try to formulate why committing suicide would be a horrible, horrible thing and who would be affected by it.

4. Never make permanent decisions on temporary feelings. Somehow that stuck with me."
