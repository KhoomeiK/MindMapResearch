You know the feelings of guilt, shame and remorse you have about relationships and your life? Working the 12 steps of AA helps me to work through those feelings so that I don't hold on to them so tightly that I want to drink over it.

I was drunk or otherwise high through my teens and twenties. I built up a lot of wrong beliefs about myself and my place in the world during that time. By the time alcohol was done with me I had every reason to drink. What I've learned about myself in AA and therapy is striking out my distorted beliefs.

A person must meet all of the current DSM criteria to be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa:

Restriction of food intake leading to weight loss or a failure to gain weight resulting in a ""significantly low body weight"" of what would be expected for someone's age, sex and height.â€‹

Fear of becoming fat or gaining weight.â€‹

Have a distorted view of themselves and of their condition. Examples of this might include the person thinking that he or she is overweight when one is actually underweight, or believing that one will gain weight from eating one single meal. A person with anorexia might alsoÂ not believe there is a problemÂ with being at a low body weight. These thoughts are known to professionals as ""distortions."""""

Therapy and meds have helped a lot but I still do dissociate.  Reading your post has helped me to clarify, possibly, why I have to dissociate. Thank you."
alcoholicsanonymous,fpei2a1,t3_gd0cfv,1588547959.0,"Yes. This is common.  It's why people relapse. Take it 1 day at a time, stay sober just for today. Worry about tomorrow tomorrow. Congratulations on the time you have!"
alcoholicsanonymous,fpd5ann,t3_gcqhiw,1588520136.0,"Your story sounds a lot like mine. I used alcohol to cope with severe anxiety. I learned that my anxiety got much worse because of my alcohol consumption. 

>. My anxiety is so ad I constantly feel like I'm going g to lass out or die most of the time at the moment but if I drink a few cans if lager I can start to feel my body relax

Every day for 11 years. In the moment alcohol made me feel instantly better. But I didn't stop drinking at the point of relief, I kept drinking.  The mornings were consistently the same: wake up in panic and surprise that I was still alive. That panic would last all day until I got home and drank again.

> I want to try medication for the anxiety. He gave me sertraline and as much as I know it doesnt work instantly

I was prescribed sertraline also. It stopped working because I continued to use alcohol. When I got sober it started working again. It helps very much for my anxiety today along with therapy and working my AA program.

Today i don't have to live in constant panic. Today I get to experience happiness. Today I get to do things to better myself and my future. I get to be an attentive partner and friend. I get to do the work to cope with my anxiety and get better. I couldn't do that with alcohol in my life."
alcoholicsanonymous,fpd3266,t3_gcqrl5,1588518791.0,"Hi, I'm an alcoholic.  I used alcohol to help control my anxiety. When I became addicted to alcohol I needed alcohol to control my anxiety. I tried only drinking on weekdays because I was most anxious on days I worked at my job. That didn't work. I still had lots of anxiety on the weekends and alcohol was the only way I could calm myself down. I tried sticking only to beer and wine. That didn't work. I would consume great amounts of wine/beer to make the anxiety go away. When I first asked for help from a doctor, I learned that my alcohol use was making my anxiety worse...much worse.  I found Alcoholics Anonymous. They helped me get sober and stay sober. I cannot consume alcohol safely. I still have anxiety but it is so much better without alcohol. I have learned to cope with my anxiety instead of making it worse."
Anxiety,fpaqezh,t1_fpaq62u,1588453553.0,I don't know enough to say they're common or not.  I haven't had them. But I've read several posts over at r/OCD with these themes.
Anxiety,fpaq2ms,t3_gca8a0,1588453346.0,Yes. There is help and you're on the right track with therapy and psych. Have you been able to tell your doc about these obsessions?
OCD,fpaoo3m,t3_gcdjf0,1588452513.0,"Yeah, same here. It's validating. It's a known fear and can't measure up to the distress caused by my fears of the unknown."
alcoholicsanonymous,fpajd8f,t3_gcceam,1588449381.0,Sponsorship as we know it today wasn't a thing when the big book was published.  The 12+12 makes much more reference to sponsorship because it was written years later.
AdultChildren,fpa7oj0,t3_gc7gso,1588442482.0,"Given your parents' relationship and the role you play in their relationship, it's not but a few steps away from wanting to fix everyone else that you love. It's how you've learned to be loved and accepted.

You are going to be a rockstar nurse some day but you're not a therapist. BTW it would be unethical if you were a therapist and you tried to treat family. 

I can relate so much to being a child with the responsibility of taking care of our parents. We didn't get a choice in the matter but we fulfilled our role like experts.  It's time to start living for yourself. I was 32 when I started to live a life of choice: finding people who are supportive and loving without any conditions.  Have an excellent time in nursing school!"

alcoholicsanonymous,fpa1dyt,t1_fp9pnds,1588438849.0,"Came in at 32 and I'm 36 now. 

I remember the feelings of hangover and withdrawal: unbounded anxiety, shaking, nausia (and vometing), brain fog, piercing headache, feeling the acidic sweat leeching from my pores. I remember the planing, seeking, scheduling, calculating and counting down the hours until I can get more booze. I remember running out of alcohol and not being able to ""sleep"" yet so I drive to get more.  I remember the sleep deprivation, hallucinations, and fear of being stalked. I remember being alone all day every day even when I was at work surrounded by hundreds of people. I remember the guilt, all of the shame, self-blame and self-hate. I remember not having anyone nor anything being worth enough to take my attention away from obsessing, obtaining, downing, withdrawing from alcohol, and repeating.  I remember these things not to dwell and relive the past, but so that I can remember how amazing it is to be alive and sober today, and how lucky I am to have found the gift of sobriety. So I go to AA regularly today to help me remember how it was and what it's like for me today."
insomnia,fp9yiav,t1_fp9wiz6,1588437191.0,Thank you :)
Anxiety,fp9bs10,t1_fp9aaws,1588421605.0,Well that's a good question. You know what its panic attacks and not something life threatening. You probably don't want to be in a hospital if you don't have to with the virus. Go with your gut is probably the best answer there is in this situation. I wouldn't worry so much about what people think of you seeking medical attention: you have the right to medical care.
Anxiety,fp9a73y,t3_gc4l7k,1588420081.0,Some things to consider: It's possible she's looking for more friends. It's possible she wants to meet new people who already share her interests. It sounds like she was speaking in general (not about you per se)
Anxiety,fp99mxl,t3_gc4e36,1588419527.0,What you describe sounds like my sadness.  If this is as frequent as it sounds I'd see a doctor. What they can definitely do is answer questions you have and get you referrals for the appropriate care.
OCD,fp8yj4j,t3_gc2oyj,1588407541.0,I don't remember that particular side effect but definitely noticed I was taking something new. They taper you on and off of drugs to monitor and mitigate side effects. When you see your doc next let them know what you're experiencing.
OCD,fp8tvyg,t3_gc1ad1,1588402830.0,"In my experience: Most of my compulsions are different than when I was a kid. Some of them go away and come back. I have a few fears and compulsions that have stuck around for a long time. But on the whole yes, things change over time. And new compulsions develop."
alcoholicsanonymous,fp8sdkh,t3_gc1lfr,1588401410.0,"In early recovery I found myself grieving the loss of 2 decades that i wasn't going to get back. On the flip side, I was (and still am) in awe of the fact that I got out alive. So many people never find recovery at all. I really feel lucky that I get to live a life that I want to live today. I've got options and I can work toward the things I want to. 

I can totally relate to the worry about being to hard or to soft on myself.  Usually what I find out is that I'm way to hard on myself and don't give myself enough credit. There's nothing wrong with being okay with yourself."
alcoholicsanonymous,fp8qft1,t3_gc0xlm,1588399653.0,"You should probably go to a doctor if your digestive system is causing problems all of the sudden.

For me, I had to break up from alcohol to find recovery. There was no way for me to be happy and control my drinking. So we have different experiences there.

I'm really glad you're finding therapy helpful! Therapy and AA have been such a benefit for me.  Even if by video chat during this time, I benefit so much from seeing my therapist on a regular basis."
OCD,fp8i48u,t1_fp8hmcj,1588392891.0,"Ah ""stay at home"" of course. Be kind to yourself and take care of yourself. I have no doubt you will get the help you are looking for :)"
OCD,fp8hkqy,t3_gbzvon,1588392488.0,That's great you have an adult in mind. Could you try calling her?
OCD,fp8hd2n,t3_gbzvon,1588392330.0,"So sorry you're being punished. 
You could tell a trusted adult."
OCD,fp8h072,t3_gbzxxu,1588392067.0,Check with your doctor. If they thought it would be harmful they wouldn't have prescribed it is my assumption.
Anxiety,fp791ou,t3_gbpnho,1588366243.0,"I have anxiety but I've also been in your position. I thought I'd like to be a therapist when I was a teenager because everyone seemed to come to me when they were having problems. I've since learned there is a fine line between being helpful and being a punching bag. I didn't have the self-esteem to know that I had just as much right to be cared about and respected.

We cannot fix one another. The best we can do is offer to listen. Whether or not they take us up on that offer is up to them. And I believe the most important thing is that we take care of ourselves first."
Anxiety,fp6oqxh,t3_gbkycb,1588355978.0,"Congratulations on posting this!!!

I hear you and I understand so much. I still suffer with this to some degree: I isolate. The lockdown has actually been pretty easy going except when I have to go out for groceries.  In my 20's though it felt so epic all of the time. I never got close to anyone because I couldn't share myself with people at all. I think a big step out of that fear has been working with my therapist who helps me to know who I am. I've also surrounded myself with kind and loving people whom I trust would never make fun of me. 

You are okay. You are just as worthy of being heard as anyone else.  I'm really glad you get to have a loving relationship with your pups."
Anxiety,fp6n1j1,t3_gbl1vp,1588355146.0,"First off: you do not have to tell your father anything. You are an adult. Even if your insurance is through their plan it's your treatment. You are under no obligation to share your medical information with your parents.

That bring said, my advice for talking to him would be to just be honest: this is something your doctor and you are going to try out, your doctor knows your medical history, and it's something that may help you cope better."

Anxiety,fp52ga5,t1_fp503oh,1588314174.0,That's a really subjective question.  It sounds like from her perspective you did. It sounds like you're not sure how you came off and would maybe like to know who was unreasonable in the situation? Maybe you both were. Maybe neither of you were. Maybe one of you was. At the end of the day it probably doesn't matter near as much as it feels right now.
Anxiety,fp4zhgy,t3_gbc4y2,1588311625.0,"This is my experience with setting boundaries:

People don't have to like my boundaries. Boundaries are important for me to set and maintain and it takes me a lot of effort to maintain them sometimes. But it's so worth it. If someone is unwilling even try to honor my boundaries I can't imagine they care much about me. Rather than focusing my intention on being acceptable to others, I've learned to care more about being right with myself. It's not perfect, it is hard, but it is well worth the effort."
Anxiety,fp4wiux,t3_gba4bw,1588309251.0,"Back in 2007 I went to a doctor.  He decided right away that it was acid reflux.  I kept trying to tell him that I've experienced acid reflux and it is nothing like acid reflux. I though it was cancer. I stopped going to doctors after that for 9 years. During that time it got worse and I developed a strong habit of sucking on losenges throughout the days.  I went to a doctor again in 2016. She straight up told me I had anxiety disorder.  My whole world flipped. I spent 9 years in mysery, discomfort , and fear and I finally learned I had anxiety and the sensation was a symptom of anxiety!  I still have the ""throat knot"" occasionally, even when I don't think I'm anxious it can show up.  Ive actually developed a lack of enough air habit of forcing my self to yawn with my face toward the sky. It looks silly but in my mind it helps. Covid lock down time and it's happening again more frequently, but at least I know what it is!"
Anxiety,fp4ulim,t3_gb0027,1588307792.0,"Since I was a small child. And I swore off napping. My mother tells me my last nap was at 2.5 yo. 

I've napped randomly throughout my adult life because I know I need sleep sometimes. But never without waking up disoriented and paniced like I've lost control/fell asleep on the job, like I lost a day of my life, and like I am wrong/bad for sleeping.  Fortunately, now I can recognize the thoughts/feelings for what they are and I can calm down much quicker than I used to."
AdultChildren,fp4mkdk,t3_gb841b,1588302343.0,"Attending ACA meetings is a big part for me.  I have a tendency to go back to my old thinking, which makes sense because I believed it all for decades and only been in recovery for a few years.  So when I go to meetings I get to relate to other people's experiences and hearing how they are able to handle things in a different way now.

I have a lot of sadness around my challenges growing up in my family that I haven't allowed myself to look at yet. I know it's going to take time and hard work to get there, but I also know I'm not going to have to go through it on my own."

OCD,fp4j13l,t3_gb9kwu,1588300120.0,"Yes. Picking a path can be distressing for a lot of people. It's the obsessive checking and worrying we get to deal with. It takes a lot of energy to do all that work on top of the work you have for school. I get so burnt out by mid-week that my schoolwork suffers. There's only so much a human can process, you know?"
alcoholicsanonymous,fp4hws3,t3_gb9i69,1588299421.0,"First thing's first.  Always make sure you're taking care of yourself.  r/alanon is for people who have alcoholics that they care about in their lives.

Does your mother want to get help? Has she asked for your assistance? If so, try calling around to treatment centers and ask them how it all works.  They hear from people all the time with questions like yours.  If not, I'm not sure there's much you yourself can do. Alcoholics need to come to a place where they recognize they want and need help, and be willing to ask for help."
