An intense fear of being abandoned, like we have been so many times already. To so not want to be alone anymore. To fill the emptiness we feel.

But also, we can't ""connect"" because we even fear our own feelings, and therefor it's hard to talk about them, they're intense, people think they're over the top, and we're making things up. But to us, they're so real. We're afraid to let you into that world and protect it with many layers of barriers. It's really nearly impossible to break through.
