bipolar,fq29znr,t3_ggfhv0,1589054175.0,This is beautiful. I like it. I get random moments where it's like everything my brain and subconscious are thinking about every single image gets jumbled into one picture and flashes for a sec. Your painting reminds me of it.

AMA,fkd8aiv,t1_fkd82t0,1584070963.0,"Maybe i didn't explain well enough. To clarify, what I'm trying to say is the bf being a healthy person he is not as much at risk and has less to worry about. Yes he can still carry the disease but he's not going to care because it probably won't affect him. Yes he should still wash his hands no he shouldn't take a cruise i think that is dumb for anyone to do right now."
