It's not that he's youtube famous and that gives him a pass, but he's actually explained his methods in his videos. 

A lot of supposed art preservation workers have come up with criticisms of the way it's filmed and Baumgartner as a person, but have stopped just short of providing anything substantial as actual damage or bad methods."
ArtisanVideos,fr5bf2q,t1_fr550zo,1589905768.0,"And if you read down further... Baumgartner has addressed all of the concerns mentioned in his videos. These people seem very, very concerned that the attractive, satisfying things were filmed and the boring, important work wasn't filmed... which is a pretty garbage reason to assume he's unprofessional or to say ""fuck this guy"". People also seem to be letting their personal feelings influence how they perceive his work (ie, I hate this guy, so I bet he doesn't know what all these chemicals do and he hates art, and this is true now because I said it.)

Mainly, people are concerned with starting in the middle of a painting when cleaning the varnish (he doesn't, he just doesn't film testing solvents on edges), or the removal of canvas, which he explains in depth that he's undoing previous excessive conservation work... and is also sped up considerably in the gif, so it looks like he's just yanking the canvas off when it's already been treated and is being peeled off in a controlled manner. And then someone says he shouldn't be using so many chemicals or solvents, saying ""how can you know what they will do in 10, 20, 50 years?"" In fact, it's explained that all of these chemicals he uses are tested, reversible, and it's known exactly how they will react over time and how they will interact with other solvents, varnishes, or paints that are used.

I haven't seen anyone give an example of how he's actually damaged a painting, just being butthurt that he's successful."
