atheism,fqxykl6,t1_fqou7f3,1589739805.0,"I had a lot of problems with revelations as well until I understood the context of it. Basically a dude was sent to an island and had a lot of hallucinations similar to the ones I experienced on really high doses of Shrooms and LSD.

I personally believe that there was a lot of psychedelic drug usage by people in the bible. Moses happened to be in an area with a root that caused auditory hallucinations and it makes shit look like it's on fire. I believe it was these substances that caused many to look inward and self-reflect.

I also believe that a lot of it was people using these visions to benefit themselves so when Jesus came along it really fucked up a lot of people's interpretation. He had a trip in those 40 days in the desert and he came to the conclusion that people were taking advantage of other people and using religion as an excuse.

I also believe that translations twisted a lot of the ""revelations"" from these substances as well. There isn't a specific word for Homosexual in hebrew. A lot of what the context says about it stems from Old men taking advantage of young boys, rape, and group orgies worshiping other gods and most importantly Paul wanting to separate themselves from the Greeks who were very bisexual at the time.

My father is a pastor so I had a shit ton of exposure to even the strangest of passages that most people do not interact with. I was taught to read with context and that led me down a strange path of figuring out the historical, societal, and geographical context for all of these stories. AND HOLY SHIT IT CHANGES A LOT. The sad part is most Christians don't actually read their bible and simply cherry pick the verses that makes them either feel safe or superior to others. Times were very different back then and women were property. We bring in our modern day biases and understanding to a time where a lot of what we believe in is the opposite. Women's rights ended at the household but they were also in charge of the Slaves who worked for the house. Love always caused problems. Everybody was insecure AF and made a lot of shitty decisions as a result.

I believe a lot of people lost what it meant once the western philosophies on drug usage changed. Nobody truly looks inward and they only see God as an external force that they can manipulate. The Canaanites were polytheistic and most likely worshiped Apollo. But this doesn't fit the modern christian narrative since nobody actually reads their bible.

Edit: I should add that this isn't me advocating the bible as 100% truth or that we need to convert. It just makes more sense to me if I view it this way and that over time religious people practice tradition over knowing what they are believing."

MDMA,fqw31dq,t1_fquth6f,1589691449.0,"Please do. That's helped me a lot especially mindfulness meditation. u/eusmi5555 The biggest thing I recommend is exposure therapy. This means doing it regardless if you feel anxious. Do things little by little. Remember that just because one person reacts negatively that just means not to with that specific person but there are many people out there who will act positive toward your actions. I started off saying that I will compliment someones clothes that I liked to a complete stranger. Example of something I did when I first started was if I saw someone who had a really cool shirt or design that I would go up to them and tell them. If they wanted to make small talk I would but normally it'd be something like ""hey I just wanted to let you know that your shirt is awesome!"" Most people reacted positively.

After a while I learned that most people like authentic responses. Ultimately that I liked being authentic and that I don't need everyone to like me. If I am being honest with them and they hate me then there's nothing I can do about it. I eventually just focused on the people who did like me for being me and found myself in healthy friendships with people.

I will repeat this part. NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO LIKE YOU and THAT'S OKAY. You don't like every single person you see or interact with. You don't agree with everyone. So there's no pressure since you know it's okay since you do it too. It's natural."

I do still joke around like this but making sure i'm being very sarcastic through my tone of voice, have a smile/grin, and my actions show that I am still interested. But like i said i have learned that a lot of girls who are secure in themselves aren't willing to play along if you don't change your tone of voice and I will also add that some girls with self-esteem issues that aren't the type to continuously seek attention will shut you out since you're no longer validating them. 

But overall showing the capability of being real with them works wonders for almost any type of girl (except maybe those who have an avoidant attachment)."
sex,fquy991,t1_fqu9yea,1589666367.0,This is where I've been having difficulty. I can't do ONS or hooking up with people I barely meet. I prefer FWBs a lot more because I still need some form of connection that isn't purely physical. I've become more open to FWBs after realizing that it is okay to still have sexual relationships with people I don't see it working long term and that as long as we communicate this is still a healthy way for myself to get some. What's the point of sex if I have to cut off a part of myself just to get a hit of serotonin? Also why is there a competition of who can care less when both our goals is to get off and have fun? like to me that seems like more effort and causes more drama than paying attention to each other and making sure that we're both mutually satisfied.
askseddit,fquux40,t3_gl26iw,1589664927.0,"that's some extreme push pull. You need to show you are being sarcastic and have your actions show otherwise. Also why do you feel a need to push pull with someone who already is interested?

Ultimately your best choice of action is to apologize and mean it. Say that you were joking around and that you're sorry that your actions pushed her away. That you are sorry for putting her through that, you will be more mindful of what you say, and that you will be better since you actually do care about her. Then actually do that. Say that you understand if she decides to not talk to you again because you were being an ass and that you will respect whatever he chooses.

This advice is if you are wanting a genuine relationship with her. If you are only trying to seduce her and don't see anything coming out of it romantically then leave her alone. There are many other girls that you can do this push/pull technique if you just want to sleep/fool around with them."

Another is due to openness of women (if they are looking for MFF). Women tend to feel safer talking to other women than men due to various reasons. A woman introducing the idea also gives some social proof to the guy in this scenario.

dating,fqkamlg,t1_fqjslu2,1589423393.0,"Those numbers are of women and men having a kid. Lots of people are having kids now without being married or in a healthy relationship. Maybe that's just the U.S.

Online dating you're right about 20% of men get 80% of women. As they get older sure they are more willing to compromise but I was talking about other factors as well. This doesn't mean that all women in their 40s are likely to lower their standards enough to get into a relationship with a man in their 20s especially if they are educated as OP said. Meanwhile educated men in their 40s may date someone in their 20s who haven't reached the same educational level as them. 

Also let's not forget that for women older you get a lot of desirable people are removed from your dating pool due to them being in relationships/marriage. So your pool does in fact get much smaller over time. Sure there is increases due to divorce rates but divorce is also a predictor of divorce so a woman may settle for a divorced man (or vice versa) and that may lead to another divorce. 

Also your assumption is that men will want to settle for women their own age with time. Older women tend to also have a lot more baggage and expectations than younger women. That's why a lot of men tend to go for younger women. Older women's ""bio clock"" may have them seeking to settle down to have kids as soon as possible, but men need to feel desired too, not settled for. Average men's pool opens up because of their age as well. 

Look at online dating examples again where older average men will ignore same age older women in favor of younger ones. Older average men have a better chance with the younger women since they are financially stable, have had years to work on their game and gain confidence, and are more mature in comparison to young men who are also fighting for the attention of younger women but don't want to settle down (again the 20% of men)."
dating,fqk90c8,t1_fqk50yv,1589422479.0,"I definitely feel that. I was supposed to go to 3 weddings this year and they all kept asking me if I was going to have a +1 to them.

Ironically thanks to covid I do have more time but less opportunities. 

It's also ironic that I'm the one often giving advice to my friends who are in relationships and my advice is what landed them a relationship in the first place. Maybe it's easier to give advice than to experience it for oneself. They've found their person and I see them being very happy with said person. They're building a life with someone they care for and were even excited to start dating them. What almost stopped them from experiencing it was themselves. Once they got over their BS and focused on communicating and working through their problems/insecurities they were able to find it. That's what I've been focusing on.

I'll meet up with them and sometimes we'll go on a second date if I think they're chill but I don't feel excited about dating them. There hasn't been one in a long time where I'm like ""Fuck yes. I'm so excited to go out with you."" Maybe it's a coping mechanism. I've only been excited about 2 people, one of which was my best friend of 12 years and they ghosted me before we even had our first date and the other we figured out pretty early on that our long term goals weren't compatible.

I really miss feeling excited about seeing someone in particular. The last girl I dated the week before quarantine we ended up doing shrooms together at a concert. It was a great concert and we had a great time but the whole time there I realized that it wasn't her that I was excited to be there with. She just happened to be the person I was seeing when I went to see my favorite artist. We talked afterwards and ended the romantic side of things and now we're friends who make music sometimes since that's what drew me to her in the first place.

People keep giving advice about not worrying, to be young, etc... But I'm already enjoying life the best I can, even in this quarantine I'm flourishing and building my craft. I'm looking toward building something with someone I actually care for. I want connection and wanting that person in particular instead of a warm body. I do what I love and I'm not afraid of asking someone out if I like them. I just haven't felt drawn to someone in a long time. Those few times that I have it isn't reciprocated which sucks but I am not mad at them for not feeling the same way. 

I don't want to settle. I want something genuine. I don't need the extremes to keep me going either. I've learned what a healthy relationship looks like and the effort it takes to maintain it. I don't need a relationship but I want a healthy one. I know i'm heading in the right direction and growing as a person. But damn I miss wanting things to go somewhere with someone instead of just seeing what happens."
dating,fqjr776,t1_fqjof40,1589414019.0,"It's interesting to see a man's dating pool increases over time and a woman's decreases. I've noticed that women do start to compromise on the people they choose to settle down with as they get older but there's a lot more competition during that time since now they're competing with younger women. So yes they may be willing to settle but there aren't as many men looking to settle for them. A man, on average, is willing to date someone around his age or younger.

I believe it also comes down to whether men want to date someone who is more ""educated"" as them. I believe most people (men and women) prefer to date someone with either similar educational background and men might be more open to getting into a relationship with someone less."
bestof,fqjp5z4,t1_fqjghdc,1589413168.0,"That's the part not many people understand. I'm from a big city in CA and going to work meant entering a building of 400+ people. Each of those 400+ people are also interacting with other people through their normal interactions like groceries, clients, friends, family, etc... Right before the stay at home we had 3 people test positive. 1 of them was visiting from another country. The other 2 worked in IT and interacted with a lot of people. Causing the entire building to self-quarantine the week before Stay at Home Order. I wouldn't be surprised if more people got it and I don't have any additional information about the numbers at this branch because I got laid off. My city got hit super hard.

I was the only one at the time taking precautions but I'm pretty sure I had it at one point before we knew it had hit CA. Once I knew cases were hitting in the states I became very cautious since I had gotten really sick earlier that month and didn't want to risk getting hit with another sickness. The amount of areas that people touch just to enter the building, taking the stairs, elevators, etc... is a shit ton. Not everybody feels comfortable wearing masks 4-8 hours a day. Then there's the people who just refuse to wear masks.

I do believe there is a way of handling this really well and get our economy up and running again. We need constant testing including getting an antibody test. We need to all wear masks and not touch our faces, have hand sanitizer stations everywhere, and keep social distancing. We're not doing this so we can't open everything back up."

There's also context in other parts where it was priests fucking young boys and orgies done to worship other gods. Also it was considered unclean due to hygiene practices at that time.

The Bible also says to respect authority and those in leadership as they were placed there by God.  Romans 13:1-2 says: ""Obey the government, for God is the One who has put it there. There is no government anywhere that God has not placed in power. So those who refuse to obey the law of the land are refusing to obey God, and punishment will follow."" The government is telling people to stay in doors for period of time to keep people safe. That sounds a lot like the story of the plagues where they were forced to stay in doors otherwise they angel of death would kill the first borns. She is refusing to actually follow the Bible and the rules of governance written in it. If anything she should use this as a time of prayer. ""Where there are 2-3 congregated in my name there I shall be"". Church is the people inside, not the building. You don't need to go there to experience church. You have your bible and you have prayer. In fact they should be praying non stop until there is a cure since this is a test of faith. It'll be like in the story of Esther.

My family is super religious. I am not. I've learned that I had to talk to them on their terms in order for them to listen to me. I dropped off some masks at my grandparents and uncles and one came up to me and told me I had no faith because I was wearing a mask. I told them Luke 4:12 says ""And Jesus answered and said to him (the devil), ""It is said, 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.'"" I told them that I loved them and wish not to do anything that would jeopardize their health. Even if it was fake what's the harm in being careful? That's when they grunted and thanked me for the masks."

It's funny cause sometimes there aren't reasons pro nor against but more like ""why not"". I've realized that many of the girls who I myself have dated would've probably given that same answer. To me those situations were the ones that gave me the most anxiety. I couldn't tell if they were with me out of boredom or because they genuinely wanted to go out with me. I agree with both of y'all, we shouldn't let ourselves be guided by loneliness but what is actually there. 

A lot of these girls who I meet online or irl have just gotten out of a relationship and have gotten the feeling that they just want to use me as a continuation of where their relationship left off. One even mentioned wanting kids soon because her and her ex had started planning to have kids and keep in mind this was told to me on our second date. The sad part was I kept going with it because she was one of the first to actually seek me out and would text me first.

Remember that it's not just about whether or not they like you but also if you actually like them. Ultimately you want a girl who wants you too.

Those 80% of women are still getting some while 80% of men struggle on those apps. so a woman can get laid a lot easier than the majority of men. Women would have to lower their standards for online dating and play the law of large numbers (which is easier since most men swipe aimlessly in hopes of  getting a match) so they can have an easier time but would have to go through more men to find a guy worth getting into a relationship with. Men on the other hand don't have as big of a pool to choose from and may settle rather than select which ones they actually want to date.

They both struggle finding relationships that are worth it but women do have the advantage of having a larger pool to choose from. It doesn't mean the pool is perfect but it's still a pool in comparison to puddle that the average man has.

At some point both men and women start coupling up but that tends to come along with age. Women end up settling since their dating pool decreases as they get older due to men having a tendency to want women their own age or younger.

So it comes down to options and ones willingness to settle. A man will most likely settle for a woman if his pool is much smaller. So if he is only getting 4 matches a year then the odds of it being a near perfect match is much lower than a woman who is getting 10,000+ matches but she would need to put in more effort in filtering the men. But she for sure has men in there who she is compatible with. The problem is finding out which one it is."

So be more picky, make sure there is healthy communication, keep an eye our for red flags and talk. Healthy relationships take effort and people who are afraid aren't willing to put in that effort or know they aren't willing to pull the plug if they're effort isn't met with their expectations.

I personally don't see those people as a loveless marriage but more that they probably aren't getting what other needs met and it's easy to point fingers at the only other person they are with.

Your needs are some alone time and his needs are social energy. This is a problem of finding a balance in which both people are having their needs met and not about relationship problems. This is why it's recommended that you both have lives outside of your relationship where you can still be a full person and this quarantine has made that really hard. 

That introversion vs extroversion is what's hurting a lot of relationships and they misinterpret what it means especially when they do seek counsel from people who don't understand what's happening or they project their own insecurities and issues to the people's relationship. I think the people who are saying stuff like this online about their partner are simply immature about it and are looking for an outlet to vent out their frustrations. 

It's an adjustment period and people's attachment styles really start to show when put into stressful situations. A person who is avoidant will feel a stronger need to runaway and a person who is anxious will feel a stronger need to pull their partner closer. Secure people have the ability to communicate their needs and work on finding that balance together instead of bitching about their partner on their public social media accounts."

When a girl I used to talk to or I tried to get at comes up and she's actually a really cool person (which is why I'm still following her) I see it as ""damn that sucks that it didn't work out"" and then leave it at that. I'm not a fool for trying, she's not a bitch for saying no, it just happened that we weren't compatible and our timing was off. I don't look to my past as something more than my past. Every rejection, every heartache, and every time we feel foolish is a step towards finding the right person for us. Sometimes what we want isn't what is best for us."
dating,fpn4rtk,t1_fpmp2pp,1588750236.0,"I get it and there are many ways of dealing/coping when it comes to this. I have the mentality that if i am going to gamble I should be okay with losing otherwise it'd be easy to either keep going all in trying to break even or go into a deep state of depression from the losses.

So I keep my expectations low and my desires reasonable. This means not planning out on a wedding when we haven't even met in person. The truth is I don't know this person. If they are going to ghost me then is that really someone I want to be with? People don't invest into someone they don't know. those that do normally tend to have some type of reason or issue as to why. I'm not saying it's bad to have desires. I have desires but I am okay if this person who I barely know doesn't meet my expectations because that person is their own individual who can choose what they want.

I am also not saying that the only way I can get attached to someone is in person or if we're being physical. Hell I don't get physical on a first date. I do it more as a read to see if we can enjoy being in each others company and what are they like in person. Sure we can FaceTime but if feel weirder doing that and there are a lot more distractions than in person. If it works for you then go for it. This is simply my strategy. I don't do well online because i'm not photogenic and my personality doesn't translate as easily (especially my sarcasm and wit). I'm great in person, can make a girl laugh, and have fun with them. They get more invested in me when I'm not a blob of text next to a roll of other men fighting for their attention. It's that simple for me. 

I'm having a great time during this quarantine making shit happen for myself and not everyone can relate to that and may feel bad for being that way. Idk. I feel bored messaging people who have nothing to say and a lot of women who are on these apps are on it because they're bored and want me to entertain them."
TheLastAirbender,fpn39iq,t1_fpmot24,1588748832.0,honestly I would love a storyline like that for a future more adult Avatar series. I'd assume it'd have to be before Korra but having the Avatar being born in a dictatorship and raised as a weapon to promote the empire. Then one day they enter the avatar state and he starts getting glimpses of memories of how the avatar is supposed to be like. All the drama and character development could be amazing to watch.
dating,fpmoofy,t1_fplav5s,1588737814.0,"I'm usually either really good or really bad and that depends on the day. I've learned to just not care about what's going on until we actually meet up more than once. I just don't get invested in someone until there's something to invest in. This quarantine has not helped with that. I'd rather just focus that time onto myself and enjoying my time being single and in solitude since it doesn't really matter trying to online date right now if you aren't meeting up.

If this person is great and conversates well with me I do get excited for a date but this person isn't someone I let myself fantasize over until there's something more concrete. So many people I had great conversations with through text suck in person and I have no chemistry with them and people that sucked at convo were pretty great in person when they were able to be present."

dating,fp10odq,t1_foy7ts0,1588221340.0,"Exactly. What helped me was seeing my friends and the reasons they've ghosted. A lot of the time it's their own issues that cause them to ghost not the person themselves.

I only had one ghosting situation that really fucked me up but it's because she wasn't someone I barely met but someone I had been best friends with for 13 years and we had already said the L word to each other. If I was able to survive that I can survive someone I barely know. Me and her are good now but for sure nowhere near romantic anymore. That happened a couple years ago and we've talked through a lot of what happened and time has allowed me and our friendship to heal.

Life's too short to remain hurt and angry when that energy can be put somewhere better. Mourn if you need to but remember that life is about moving forward. I am thankful for the lessons I learned through that experience since I am no longer afraid of going for what I want since I've already experienced the worst case scenario, and it was one I never thought would've happened. It's strange how freeing it is to not be afraid after experiencing the one thing I am most afraid of."

I have the same mentality as Saul\_goodman93 but remind myself it is okay to grieve, after all I did invest into something that didn't lead anywhere.

dating_advice,foxhfph,t1_fov55kd,1588144097.0,"Most advice I've seen is to get the person off the app asap and try to meet sooner. Being on the app means that you are competing with a lot of other people since that person either has a bunch of other people messaging them on there or will be swiping during lulls in the conversation. Also it uses the benjamin franklin method of getting them to invest a bit more into you. I also wouldn't be surprised if the other reason is to be able to send and see pics. I'd understand Instagram more if it's about making sure the person actually looks like their photo. Snapchat can also help filter out people who catfish.

Now I think it's so fucking stupid that a lot of people switch apps only to never respond again. it's so dumb."
AskMen,fosjxyv,t1_for73o4,1588032180.0,"Was in this similar situation. Friends for 15 years and she ended up moving to the other side of the world for 4 months. Those 4 months turned into a for life situation. We ended up missing each other a bit too much. We even promised that if we were both single at 35 we'd get married and we'd both go out of our ways to make it happened.

I tried to make it work but it didn't even though we still cared and loved each other. Part of me always believed she'd be the one I'd end up with and she said the same thing about me, all our friends and family say it too. But it never happened. I tried and it was a moment of bad timing since she got with her boyfriend. 

Now I don't know. If it happens it happens but that shit sucked and it would honestly have to be her trying in order for it to happen. I love her still but it's different than it was before. I'm thankful for her and I still consider her a really close friend. I don't believe that it will happen tbh. Lots of things need to change. I am no longer hopeful nor really desiring it. I've changed a lot and it sucks that she never really got to experience this new me. I honestly gave it my all but she was too scared.

I honestly was ready to move over there and put in the effort cause to me she was worth it. Now i don't believe that she is. She isn't that to me anymore. If it happens it's because of circumstances not in my control. But I don't linger or tell myself the lie that it will happen anymore. I don't believe things happen unless someone makes it happen and it won't be me doing it."
dating_advice,fogzu9i,t1_fob9ruq,1587758892.0,"I'm the same way. I've learned that it's my attachment style which is anxious attachment. I get anxious trying to keep them in my life so I either try too hard or pull away out of fear of losing them.

I had to change my mindset in order to not get super depressed every time I experience I maybe. I've learned that I truly don't know someone until a year or two into dating. I've learned that I want to feel secure in a relationship but that security takes time to build. It's like having a plant. If you don't water the plant it will die but if you over water it you drown it. Each plant is different. Some you don't have to water it in weeks and others you have to do it daily. To get mad at oneself for not knowing what it is when it hasn't been communicated is stupid since you don't know. The goal is to find someone who is on the same page as you or at the very least is willing to communicate with you.

I have a habit of dating avoidant people. These are the people who do want something but the moment they feel a bit clingy the retreat. That's not me failing. That's me dating someone I'm not compatible with. I want to be with someone who wants to be with me. So if it doesn't work out it frees me to find someone who it can work out.

It's easy to fall into the trap of saying ""always alone"" or ""nobody will ever want to be with me"" since it might feel like that but the fact is there are a lot of people who also feel that way. The simple act of finding someone compatible is an amazing feat yet people do it all the time. The fact is I want someone now and not later which life doesn't work that way and that's okay. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. If you experience lows then that means the highs will be even higher. 

I don't believe falling for someone is bad. I think we just need to have realistic expectations. Everybody goes at their own pace and sometimes if you're lucky they line up. I can fall for someone and respect that they're not there yet or that they don't feel what I feel. Falling for someone is easy, maintaining a relationship is hard and I want to be with someone who wants to maintain a relationship. I don't hate the person for not giving me what I want. I let myself grieve the expectations and desires I had with this person and then I move on. It's easy to dig our heels and not want to change our path but for all we know we would've been miserable in the long run with this person. That person saw something we didn't so we gotta respect that. We often wear rose tinted glasses when we fall for someone that we don't see the red flags. We project our desires on people until we know them. 500 Days of Summer is a great example of that. We can be mad at them or we can use it to build ourselves up and go for what we want."
conspiracy,fogxa9r,t1_foe2dh8,1587758025.0,"I defended him during the election but I did not vote for him nor did I vote for Clinton. I wrote in for bernie because he was the closest to what I believe in. I defended Trump in the way the media would cut up his speeches and twist what he would say. I think he did an okay job in some areas and really bad in other areas. I still prefer him over clinton. His handling on this crises though has not been the best. IDK if clinton would've done better and honestly that shit doesn't matter. He is our president and I don't like how he managed this. I know for a fucking fact that the media would've destroyed him had he acted sooner but he still made the decision to not lock shit up.

Now I believe in a lot of conspiracies and don't necessarily believe every person out protesting to open things up are in fact Trump supporters. There are some crazy people out there that I know for a fact aren't actors. I've dealt with enough people to know there are a ton of extreme people on both sides. Hell my cousin in law was one of the people protesting and he owns his own company which is why he's protesting. He's losing a lot of money and business and believes that all he has to do is just buy masks and shit will be okay, which it might or it might not, masks can only do so much. I don't think he has malicious intent but he talks like a madman sometimes. People need to learn to speak to their audience. Trump needs to learn to speak to his people who will always believe him even when he's sarcastic.

I started going to rallies and talk to people since the last election. I believe having a conversation is what changes people's minds or at the very least let's me know where they are coming from. Even the extreme people tend to have some logic that they're following. Sadly sometimes they view me as an enemy just because of my skin color. I believe that racism comes from unproven conspiracy theories that these people have so it's hard to logic them out of it since they only want proof that validates them.

Sorry if i'm rambling on here but I just want to say I understand where you're coming from but availability heuristic due to the media and even personal interactions make it hard to not generalized people. The day of Trumps election was the day I received the most racist remarks on the street and I doubt they were all actors. I wore a red pizza planet the next day and had a lot of people calling me a traitor until they read my hat. It sucks that the media and government is dividing us instead of uniting us. It sucks that we can't trust either."

TripSit,foer3mu,t1_foei89p,1587711903.0,"hey hope things are going better now and I'm sending as much love your way. Love is what matters most and sometimes we constantly seek it outside of ourselves. the truth is even in these isolating times that we must be the well that overflows to those around us. We must love ourselves so much that we are overflowing so that way we don't empty ourselves for others. Sometimes we find someone that we want to give our all to because that is what we're meant to do. I believe that is a good thing. But that love needs to respected.

I always get a bit lonely during my trips even if I am tripping with loved ones. It makes me look inward and I feel far away from everyone. I try reaching out but sometimes timing is just off and that's okay. If everything worked out perfectly we wouldn't enjoy the good times as hard. we need lows to have highs. Being away from people makes us miss them and it makes the reunion more special.

I also reflect back to the people I loved but never really got intimate with and same with you I loved to hold them. I can't help but think that it wasn't as true as it could've been. I think sometimes we project what we want to a person who isn't the best for us only because we really want that. That person isn't the best for us and brings out our deepest insecurities and makes us feel empty in the end. We cling on to hope that something is there because of this loneliness and that fear of not finding it can lead to us down a path of destruction.

Fear is primal and guides us. Fear is good but can make us make bad decisions. Fear of being alone is good because we need people. fear of being alone can lead us to clinging on to the wrong people even when it's obvious that they aren't the best. Fear is good since it makes us act. Fear can make us so afraid of moving that we stay in limbo. Courage over fear is what makes us strong. Courage to be alone until you find the right person is amazing. Courage means you respect yourself and what you want so much that you take action. The hardest thing to have courage in is loving yourself because it means accepting the good and the bad, flaws and all. That courage teaches us how to love someone who loves us flaws and all.

You mentioned your life fell apart 9 months ago. I ask you to find courage in yourself, to love yourself so much, that you remake yourself into the person you want to be. Those lows are going to make your highs more beautiful because you have something to compare it to.

Life is a beautiful journey and the hero's journey means he needs to go to his lowest in order to come up at top. You will get the person who will love you, I have no doubt in my mind about that. You will grow and blossom, no doubt about it. The effort is being made and I can tell your mind is already searching for what you need to do.

You are not alone. We are going through this together. Even if we aren't there in person we are all connected and bounce off each other's energy. Love transcends the physical world. Everything will be okay. You will overcome any obstacle with time. Be patient. Remember it takes time for a garden to grow and bear fruit. Tend to your garden.

Love you and I hope you're enjoying your trip."

She had the democrats in her pocket and I honestly felt like Trump and her were in cahoots. I also believe he was not supposed to win. She didn't account for the fact that a lot of people hated her even in her own party. Then she lost and Trump unexpectedly won. From what I heard he was completely shocked that he did and that's why he didn't even bother to stop doing business.

Now I believe he is an opportunist who never heard the word no. His ego got super inflated, which is surprising since he had a massive ego, and he had the republicans backing him up and telling him what to do."

I realized that although I've dated a lot more these past 2 years that I haven't actually dated anyone I was excited to date. I am not really into hookups but I think that may simply be due to lack of experience and some old values that I no longer hold or deem necessary to have. So I'm super down to hookup even if it doesn't lead anywhere. So dating more intentionally but open to hooking up and if leads somewhere it leads somewhere and if not oh well. I will keep trying to find someone I want to continue dating and I might as well get some in the meantime especially since something tells me my dry spell is going to go on much longer that I anticipated.

dating,fnxvcyh,t1_fnwzl3a,1587347136.0,"to a point. There's a time and a place for everything. Becoming depending on a person you barely know is almost never a good thing but it does work for some people when the other person is on the same level. To care about a person is not a bad thing at all. Some people fall really fast and it isn't reciprocated as quickly or intensely means that they're not on equal ground or expectations. This is where having a conversation and respecting where the other person is. Example if someone says I love you very quickly it can either make me realize that I don't love them or that I am not there yet. Both ways I can be honest and either end things or admit that I am not there yet but I am on my way there.

Some people move quick, some don't, and it's up to each of us to decide what is acceptable and find someone who either lines up with us or is willing to meet somewhere in the middle.

So who controls the relationship? Both people do. Together they create a relationship. If one person isn't into it then it's not going to work out.

Chances are each person is going to be at a different stage in a relationship at some point and that's perfectly natural. In the early stage, symbiosis occurs where both people look for similarities and you idealize the other person. 

The next stage is differentiation which means that one person may snap out of the honeymoon stage sooner than the other. This may cause a person to pull away to get space while the other clings on harder and that may cause problems. This stage is natural since one needs to find the ""I"" again in a relationship since a healthy relationship is 2 individuals who choose each other. Maybe this is where your theory of who has the power but I believe it is up to both parties to decide what they want to do from there. Give each other some space and come back together or decide to break up because both people aren't getting what they want.

People's attachment styles are very important here as well. An anxious person will pull harder and an avoidant person will push away. Ideally we want to be with someone secure who can communicate and are okay with being single but choose the other person. It is up to the anxious person and avoidant person to decide if they're actions are correct and they can change it. if you are a secure person you still need your space and you still need the other person to be a part of that relationship so you need to communicate that. If they aren't willing to work with you then that's not a relationship but an individuals demands of you while holding your relationship hostage which is not a healthy relationship so get out."
bipolar,fnxru5t,t1_fnur9bj,1587345038.0,"I literally have a masters in clinical mental health counseling. Being bipolar is what led me to go down this path after dropping out of med school. My abnormal psych professor is the reason why I became willing to try medication. He became my mentor for a couple of years and gave me my first clinical internship. He taught me that the best form of treatment is a mix of medication and therapy that would teach me healthy coping mechanisms and introduced me to IPSRT. To say I didn't do my due diligence is simply incorrect.  

I have a trigger, mood, and sleep journal that I use to track myself daily. I keep a consistent schedule and act accordingly depending on where I'm at. Some months are harder than others but I have maintained a pretty good schedule even during this crises (thank god I was working from home prior to this quarantine since losing my routine would've been rough). 

I've been on Lamictal (Lamotrigine), Seroquil (quetiapine), Clozapine (Clozaril), and lithium. Lamictal led to me rapid cycling. Clozapine put me in too much of a head fog that I couldn't function. Seroquil and Lithium combo worked best for me but I had to stop Lithium because I have kidney and liver problems which led to me having to find a better way of handling it without medication otherwise the meds will kill me. My professor is the one who got me into learning about eudainomia and to stop pursuing happiness but instead subjective well being. This meant making all those changes I mentioned in my previous post. I'm not seeking the high of happiness anymore because that shit is fleeting and destructive and will literally kill me if I continue that. Instead I look to flourish in my virtues and try my best because that's all I really can do.

Bipolar runs in my family. My grandfather had undiagnosed bipolar and my uncle died from his extreme drug use that came from manic episodes and him seeking that high when depressed after his mom died. I know the fucking consequences of it. I've seen my family's life ruined by it and it honestly terrifies me that I may pass it down to my kids. Mania is still a euphoric high that is so extreme that I can't compare it but that does not mean I still can't be happy in the quiet times. Even when depressed I do things not because I have the strength but simply because it needs to get done for the end eventually happens. I may also die if I keep my binges going when manic. Being forced to deal with my mortality even when I have suicidal ideation is a fucking ride. What helped me get through it was actually counseling other bipolar people who were in the same spot as I was. I knew what they were going through and I had to give them counseling that went against what I was feeling at the time. That forced me to take my own advice and be better.

I no longer work in the mental health community since it became a strong trigger but I learned a lot about various types of treatments and coping skills. I want to thank them everyday because I have hope. You can try and take that from me due to your own projecting but you can't. My life isn't perfect but goddamn it's way better than it's ever been and I love my life and I love myself. I will do all the due diligence I need because I fucking love myself and want what is best for me in the long run."
bipolar,fnupzsn,t1_fntxgvt,1587268116.0,"To me it doesn't matter then. I'd rather live those years stable, lose everything, and then put it back together than to never let myself enjoy those good years.

Life is going to have it's ups and downs regardless if you have a mental illness or not. I'd rather live my best life and struggle than struggle without experiencing any good. I can't control when I'm going to blow up and self-destruct.

It's like being an alcoholic. You never stop being an alcoholic. If you fall off the wagon you can't just stay off. You put in the effort to get back on it. I've created a support structure for myself including one other bipolar person who we keep each other accountable. We know the struggle that's what makes it work. We have friends who call us out when we're being too much or if we say anything we shouldn't have. I've had friends who will stop me from drinking too much, cut me off my weed, who will drag me out of my room to go for a hike/gym. Hell even in this quarantine my roommates have been amazing and we've been each others pillars in this time.

So yes I've been pulled to extremes which means there's always a possibility of going to those extremes or even further. That's just a part of my life. I've accepted that possibility. But i've also accepted the possibility that I can manage it and I can help others who are also dealing with this. Some days will be harder and that's okay.

I love myself. I love what I can create with my unique experience called being bipolar. I've had to accept myself, flaws and all. I've learned that I have more control over myself than I let myself believe. When every inch of me is screaming out ""fuck it! drink everything! literally try to fuck every girl! Spend all your fucking money!"" it's easier to give in than to not do it. And lord knows i'm tired of having to practice control but guess what. I fucking love that I don't have to do that anymore. That I can actually hold relationships now. That I actually love myself rather than being disgusted at myself. 

This too shall pass is one of my favorite quotes and my mantra for being bipolar. The ups, the downs, the stability, it will all pass."
bipolar,fntduan,t1_fnscr1w,1587239666.0,"going along with spacebound, do not throw your medicine away. This shit that we're dealing with is a journey and for many one that seems to have no end. BUT there is still hope. The medication isn't the solution to cure it. There is no cure that we know of. All we can do is make it easier on us.

I was diagnosed II about 8 years ago. Took 2 years to finally be willing to take meds and after experiencing psychosis I gave it a try. It took me 3 years to find a combo that let me be functional. Once I found that combo it was to find out how to properly live with it and find stability. I went down the spiritual books and learning how to be aware of my body and how to calm myself down or gain strength to do what I need to do. That shits hard. It took me 2 more years to put myself back together and learn healthy coping mechanisms. I had to change everything to make it work. I changed my diet, started working out more, being very picky about my strains of weed (indica for mania and sativa for depression), had to dig really deep to find the source of a lot of my triggers, and change my entire environment to one where I can communicate where I'm at and have the support to do what I need to do.

I got off meds about a year ago and it took about 6 months to slowly get off of them. I've never felt so stable in my life. I still feel that rush of mania that feels like I just took some molly and I still get those depressive episodes where I feel like I can't  get out of bed or even focus. BUT i don't give into it anymore. I simply acknowledge it and then do the healthy steps to not let it overcome me. Making sure I sleep, do what I need to do, and all that takes a lot of will power but goddamn it becomes worth it to have a good life.

So it's possible but it is fucking hard. There will be days where it just doesn't feel like any progress is happening and days where you feel like you've regressed. But you can overcome it. It doesn't define you, and even if it is a part of you it isn't the only you that remains."
seduction,fnpssto,t3_g3632s,1587151345.0,"As someone who is currently working on this and have been improving I may have some tips that can help.

First, it feels unnatural because it is unnatural to you. Your natural state is to not escalate because it feels safe. It isn't until you've done it enough times that it becomes natural. Similar to the first time you learn to ride a bike. You'll be very self aware and you may fall a couple times even if you really badly want it and are consistently comparing yourself to other bike riders. Some people learn to ride at a much younger age and others may not learn until adulthood. So you have to do it until you're no longer thinking too much about what it is you're doing. Easier said than done I know but it's still the first step.

Second, it's about changing your mindset. ""I am scared that by starting to be sexual or show more attraction, I will creep the girl away."" I was the same way but I've learned that I need to be authentic in my actions. If I want to be sexual or show interest I am doing it because I want to do it and I want to be with someone who reciprocates it. So let's say I do show interest and that girl gets creeped out. Chances are it wasn't going to work out regardless if I hadn't shown interest. I deserve to be with someone who wants me and accepts me so this is a great way of finding out who is genuinely interested in me acting that way toward them. So if I get rejected then that's a good thing since I'm now free to go find someone who does.

Third, girls want to know that you're interested. My god this lesson is one that I keep having to learn and once it clicked it made things easier. You're probably worried that you may have misread something in her actions and what she's said, well so is she. If you're not making a move then she's going to assume you're not interested and that will make her want to be with someone who makes her feel desirable. We all want to feel desired by someone we desire. The best way to remove any questions about interest is to act and show interest with your actions.

Fourth, inexperience can create a negative cycle so break the cycle by doing something different. This means escalating. This means being more touchy. This means doing something besides doing nothing.

Lastly, tension is created by friction. If you are not doing anything to create friction then there will be no tension. Friction creates sparks. Without any sparks there is no flame so you have to escalate. So how does one create it? With your actions and standing your ground on it. This means not backpedaling when you show your interest. Let's say you do escalate and she's not into it immediately, don't count her off or say you were just kidding. Instead say ""okay you're not there yet and I'll respect that"".  This shows that you respect her boundaries and that you'll go at her pace BUT that you are still interested in her.

to sum it up, you just have to do it. We all naturally have urges and are pretty decent at reading signals but we have so many mental barriers that prevent us from doing it. Those mental barriers could be low self-esteem, fear of the unknown, or even personal beliefs. Worst case scenario you end up back where you started and find a new girl.

I personally have had a lot of shitty situations come up very early on when I first tried to escalate. I had a lot of negative views due to my religious upbringing, shitty bad experiences showing interest, and when I finally did feel comfortable I had them lie about me and say that I was tricking them and coercing them just so they can get with someone in my friend group and they don't look bad. Honestly that shit hurt a lot and it caused me to continue to shut down even though I naturally wanted to escalate with these girls who I had feelings towards.

I ended up getting super close with a bunch of female friends my last couple years of college where I felt comfortable being more touchy with them. This helped me getting comfortable cuddling, being more affectionate, and it was low pressure since I knew them. I'm still working on doing it sooner rather than the third date but it's progress and I've become happier knowing that I am at least being more true to myself and being honest with my actions with the women i date.

I hope this helps. Remember it's okay to be where you are at now and there is no judgement on that. If they judge negatively then you don't want to be with them. So start escalating because you want to. If they are into it then respect them. If you keep escalating after they've said no that makes you a creep. So as long as you don't do that you're fine."
StackAdvice,fnnvngm,t1_fnnt0ur,1587103145.0,"Honestly the best advice here. I personally love L-theanine with caffeine but even then if I am not eating well, sleeping well, or even getting some exercise it can only help so much. Being able to ask for help and feel free to make things happen I do really well as oppose to feeling alone and my mental energy is wasted on not acting.

Med school is a marathon, not a race. Getting into a routine that is healthy for you is the most important part. Eating well keeps your body in good shape (Fish oils and omega 3 fatty acids are very important), sleep is what converts short term memory to long term which is why I do take melatonin occasionally if my sleep schedule gets too messed up or l-theanine for quality sleep too (if i'm not having caffeine with it), and working out helps with stress."
musicindustry,fnjh6sh,t3_g1xnwd,1586998891.0,"I got my degree in Psych as well. Music industry doesn't care about degrees especially if you can do what you say you're going to do. Psychology helped me a lot when it came down to working with clients and making connections. People want to feel a connection and a sense of trust with the people they work with. It's been interesting experience especially when in the studio working with artists in song writing. The artist must feel like they're in a safe space where they can say anything, be open, and feel heard. This helped me a lot especially when it came down to artists who are more emotional in their process.

Career wise I'm very thankful for my degree but I did have to learn a lot of business and marketing on my own. Knowing how to market oneself is the most important part and selling your product (whether it's yourself or your company)."
dating,fned3ow,t1_fn0h6fh,1586887210.0,"ehh not always. Some are the reason why they got divorced. Some are divorced because they couldn't communicate or compromise, some are divorced because they want different things and because they've been divorced they hold stronger their beliefs of what their SO should be like so that the divorce would be worth it.

Obviously this depends on the individual circumstances. I've seen a lot of divorcees who are extremely anti relationships or trying to get into a relationship but carry their issues from their failed marriage into it.

Divorced people are also more likely to get divorced."
AdvancedProduction,fn1lzke,t1_fmovnp4,1586564872.0,"So that depends on budget. At the bare minimum I'd suggest an audio interface (XLR and Line in for Mics and Instruments), DAW installed on a computer that can handle it preferably without lag, SM57 mic, Midi piano, and studio monitors. SM57 mic is versatile mic and pretty cheap.

For DAWs that comes down to personal preference and even genre. I personally use FL Studio and Pro Tools. I simply prefer FL Studio for midi stuff but Pro Tools is a fucking beast. I have been slowly moving towards Nuendo. So again it comes down to personal choice.

So your budget will decide which specific equipment and extras like sound proofing your room. When I first started I used a sleeping bag over me singing into a mic. 

I hope this helps!"
dating,flprz9l,t1_flp0plc,1585367168.0,"it's part of the compatibility part. People's styles of being together and apart are very important in how happy you feel in a relationship. For some they need constant texting and others want all the space in the world but are very present when physically present. It's finding the compatibility. 

If part of your love language is quality time or words of affirmation and you don't receive it from your SO then you're going to feel unloved and that's going to lead to resentment later on. So it's also on him to meet your natural requirements to make sure your needs are checked. Not putting effort into each other's love languages can cause otherwise great relationships to suck and feel stressful."

Do you want to be with someone who can communicate? Do you want to be in a healthy relationship?

Actions > Words. If he wants to be with you and sees a future then he will put in effort and establish a stronger foundation. A lot of people don't want to hurt someone or are cowards with their own emotions.

It comes down to respecting yourself and your needs. Right now people have no excuse not to put in effort because there is literally nothing else to do. If they can't put in effort now, what makes you think they will put in effort in the future?"

Coronavirus,flb4ko9,t1_flau5g8,1584997250.0,"Those are true but whenever people do bring up the fact that most people won't die it's often accompanied by someone who is contributing to the rate of infection. Yes there are outliers but the problem with outliers is that it can happen to people you know or even yourself. There's still going to be a lot of deaths and a lot of people living with messed up lungs and kidneys because of this virus especially younger people.

The overall data is also based on who has been tested and confirmed so the numbers of infected may also be much higher. We don't know the long term ramifications of this or even if immunity is built after having survived it. There are too many unknown variables for what can happen next as well. Either way I will explicitly say ""STAY AT HOME"". I'm not saying you're implying this but someone may use it as an excuse to fit their biases and desire to do what they want. 

Either way the story is a tragedy and is sad. That could've happened to anyone's daughter even if it isn't statistically likely as was the case with that particular family."

askseddit,fkozmsk,t3_fjt6lq,1584398514.0,"A couple of things. One is that you're getting information about someone second handed which may not always be accurate. You don't know where she is at mentally. For all you know is that that she's trying not to mess around with fuck boys at the moment and acting like one would lower your chances. She may not even be into fuck boys in general but went for one once and got a reputation for it. Second the reason why girls are interested in fuckboys is that they're normally really confident and are willing to lay it all down and go for what they want. You don't need to be an asshole or a fuckboi to be like that. You just have to go for it. Third, pretending to be someone you're not means that if they do become interested in you then you'll most likely have to keep it up and it won't work out long term.

So who gives a fuck about what she's into? You go talk to a pretty girl because you want to talk to her. You flirt because you want to. Don't change who you are to please someone you don't even know that well. Just talk to her and be your best self. Who gives a fuck about what experiences you do or don't have because in the moment it's all about what the experience is like with that person at that exact moment.

If she's not into it then she's not into it and there's nothing you can do change her mind. You lying will set off bullshit meters way more than being confident in who you are. My advice is to just not let her run over you and set boundaries. If you don't agree with her on something then don't agree with her. if you agree then agree. Just don't be an asshole. just state it with confidence.

This is what people mean by ""be yourself"". You go for what you want because you want it. Now if you go for it and she's like ""nah"" then move onto someone who does want it. trust me she won't be the last girl."
AskReddit,fkkce5j,t1_fki0ltb,1584280441.0,"that's what happened to me too. I could literally feel the morphine spread throughout my body as a wave of euphoria and relaxation. At the time my anxiety levels were through the roof and for the first time they just drowned in goodness. I was 16 or 17 at the time and barely started smoking weed but it was so different. I liked it a lot but knew that's precisely why I had to not do more. I had been in a lot of pain before I got it and that switch was intense. I had received news that they thought I had cancer and I simply didn't care and was off in my own happy world. 

The good news was that it definitely stopped me from my experimentation into painkillers I had found myself in when I was 16-17. now it's just psychedelics in a safe environment and weed for me."
AdvancedProduction,fj3w2zb,t3_fbc4g6,1582994536.0,"I personally am for buying the equipment yourself and then just paying someone to do the mixing and mastering. Only time studio time is worth it imo is if you're working with a producer who is also contributing in helping you create a sound. I've had studio time where they've had me pay someone else to mix and master it which caused me to spend more money. Studio time really is a mindset and can be done outside of the the professional studio and in a room studio. What matters is that you are creating.

Also the biggest recommendation I have for people who do get signed or a signing bonus is to use that money to build a studio since a lot of money ends up getting spent in the studio that only has one avenue of ROI which is just that album. Building a studio can also generate more revenue and allows you to work with more people on your project if you so wish or have unlimited time on your own to perfect your work."

I've worked at multiple places for upwards of a year as a temp and was never brought on as an employee since it was cheaper for them not to have full-time employees and the temp agency took a fee and a percentage of the pay. Example my current position actually pays $23 an hour but the agency listed it as $20 so I'm making less and am not employed. So many people get fired too if they try to speak of their rights to management and just fired under ""insubordination"" and due to California's at will policy they can be fired without notice. 2 of these companies also do their taxes in Texas so they even evade California taxes. I met my friends baby daddy's father and he's a CEO at a company here in Temecula and he straight up told me how to avoid paying taxes on employees since he's been doing it for years and I mentioned I am starting my own company after AB5 became law. Companies will find a way to avoid it, this just causes more stress on the people who are affected.

musicindustry,fiz57oq,t1_fiz3swi,1582854426.0,"it sucks that this is the clause often used for festivals but I will say that it does generate a lot of hype, word of mouth, and can lead to bigger shows. I'd say do it and use it as a marketing point when you book future shows. Now you're not just some band, you're a band that plays festivals. I go to a lot of music festivals and discovered a lot of new artists through it even at the earliest time slots. If they're good I'll go support them at local shows. Just saw Slow Hallows at a small venue after I walked past Sonora at Coachella. I've converted a few fans and brought them to the show.

Being paid in exposure sucks ass but like I said learn to market it. ""We have a big enough following that X festival sought us out and had us open for X artist."" Merch is where the money is at now anyways as an artist. So yes they may take 20% but you just mark it up a bit higher so that you can still make a profit. Festival merch is expensive for that very reason. Also use the performance to promote your online merch as cheaper (Chance the Rapper, Bastille, Macklemore and a bunch of other artist promote their online merch as cheaper at their concerts). Increasing your KPIs and clicks to your site or music pages is marketable and makes it easier to gain more followers.

I hope you take it and it sucks that you may have to cancel a show. I'd see if you can ask for an exemption since it was booked before they booked you and if they say no ask to be compensated for your financial loss. You can negotiate. Worst case you just don't perform which is where you're leaning at currently.

I work with artists and I personally have been screwed by contracts due to being young and not knowing any better. You have more power than you believe and if you aren't happy with the terms it's better to speak up and then meet somewhere in the middle. Learn to negotiate and market your fans in the negotiations. Exposure is a good thing if you know how to use it.

Quick Edit: 80/20 is pretty average for when venue sells. Nobody does anything for free in our industry. Again feel free to negotiate. See if they can move your merch higher up for that amount. Don't be a push over but don't over do it either. Be willing to meet somewhere in the middle."

microdosing,fiz0k72,t1_firzlvn,1582851280.0,"The biggest thing is making sure you are microdosing correctly rather than just dosing. I was talking to a friend of mine about MD and he said he would always MD on 50ug which is not an actual MD. 

Also a lot of people don't know that MD is taking it below the threshold so that causes a lot of concern from people. My mom for sure is one of those people. It's so bad that once she saw me drink 2 beers over the course of 5 hours at a wedding and she tried to takeaway my keys since she thought I would be too inebriated to drive. That being said it's an honest concern people may have if they don't know any better but explaining what it is you're doing and how it affects your body and others is a great step toward educating others."
musicindustry,fisxjfk,t1_fisuqsf,1582696378.0,"That line is completely dependent on the manager as to where he should draw the line. I'm a manager and I personally see it as unprofessional since it risks the work relationship and can lead to some problems down the line depending on the artist.

And whether or not he'll continue to mess around with a client that's up to him. And whether or not you should be paranoid is up to you. How much do you trust him? My married friend and I used to fool around before she met her husband. Once she met him we stopped that and kept things strictly platonic. Now her husband would have a right to be paranoid since we are also really close friends, she still comes over to my place and we smoke and drink, and she sometimes even spends the night. But he trusts her because he knows that's not the type of girl she is and he's goddamn right. I say that in the best way possible. We both have strong boundaries and no matter how fucked up we are we've never been the type to cheat nor even willingly be fuck someone in a relationship, open or not. I love our friendship and I'm happy she's with someone great.

so again it comes down to how much do you trust him. If you don't and don't say anything then you're actions may lead to him doing it. People tend to make self-fulfilling prophesies. If you do trust him then you shouldn't be paranoid. If you're not sure then talk about it. If you're in a relationship with this man then you should hopefully have one where you can talk about it and see if there's anything that can be done to ease your concerns.

As long as she's not immature it's not humiliating. I've asked out a married woman from my class in uni. She was cute, we got along well, she was only a year older,  and she never mentioned her husband before. I guess I should've seen the ring before I asked her out. Now I'm the idiot for not picking up something she never mentioned and was so obviously a known fact. I asked her out, she showed me her ring, and said she wasn't interested. We ended up being friends still and her husband is a nerd like me and we get along great.

So it's not humiliating if you simply acknowledge that shit like this will happen and there's no point in thinking about it too much. In fact, I don't even think about it when I still go up and talk to some random girl. I learned that I'd rather have them reject me than make that decision for them. If I don't talk to them then it's gauranteed that nothing is going to happen. If I make a move there's a 50-50 chance. If she has a boyfriend, is gay, or simply is not interested then oh well I'll move on to the next girl. I don't need to make it awkward. Depending on how she said it I'll either say it was nice to meet them or be like damn, oh well, and keep talking to them. If anybody makes fun of me then that's on them for making fun of someone who has the guts to talk to a girl they're attracted to and want to meet."
AskMen,fiovwn7,t1_fiog33t,1582592238.0,">As a result, it's a lot harder to strike up a conversation because it does feel like you're interrupting and bothering the person. Plus, like you said, most people figure that everyone turns to online dating anyway, so why bother folks in public?

Yet everyone complains about online dating. Yeah I hate being that guy who interrupts and feels like i'm bothering someone but that's assuming that I'm a bother and I don't add value to anyone's life even in a quick interaction.

I think that's where a lot of problems come up now. We're afraid of being vulnerable and taking someone out of their comfort zone. I think talking to people is great and I've noticed that attractive people are comfortable talking to strangers because they have a lot of great experiences talking with random people. Us average or below average guys don't have as many good experiences so we assume not everybody does so we don't act.

I feel weird talking to someone I don't know and that's because i'm not used to it. I also put in a lot of weight onto the conversation going perfectly but it won't. So I'd rather just do it and increase the chances of it working out with said person than to not and guarantee that it won't.

There are also places where it's ""allowed"" like bars and clubs but the music tends to be too loud anyways and more women tend to have their guard up higher since they know who is there. I think we need to just get used to talking to people on our day to day again. I love connecting with people even shortly by making them laugh, asking questions, etc.. it's a nice experience for everyone involved and is a pleasant unexpected surprise. Leave the person alone if they're obviously not into it or ignore you and you'll be fine.

The real reason why I do it is probably because online dating just doesn't work for me. I hate competing for attention for someone who has literally hundreds of other guys waiting for me to fuck up. Then you meet up in person and most of the time there just isn't chemistry. In person you figure all of it out quickly. Are you attracted to them? are they attracted to you? Are they good with conversations? do you have some chemistry? All easily answered with an approach. My personality doesn't translate online which makes up a large part of me."

Things like the person's attachment style which to your person could've been avoidant attachment which causes them to run away or seek for reason for it not to work so they have an excuse to run away. Sometimes some people just have different expectations due to their models in their lives. I had one girl who believed that you had to be constantly arguing and controlling to show love because all her aunts were in relationships like that.

I've had emotional vampires that drain me and that's not right. I love myself enough that I'm overflowing with love and care but that means respecting myself and my needs. The goal is to find someone who also overflows and chooses to build something. so I look at actions and my feelings to see who I should be with. My gut is right so I've learned to listen to it.

If someone gives up on something great because it was ""too easy to have"" then they don't respect and care about what they have. These people are the ones who aren't willing to continue investing and continue building and that means they aren't the type of person I want a relationship with. It sucks and it's stupid that people do lie even to themselves. It is frustrating but I have other good things in my life to focus on when it does get too frustrating."

Coachella,fdpkk2h,t1_fdox906,1578631176.0,I tend to go with groups but for at least a day or 2 I'll venture off on my own since I don't always have the same tastes as all my friends or they just spend too long getting ready and there's early acts I want to catch. This year is my first year going absolutely solo even though I bought my sister a ticket for her graduation (she's trading it to go a different weekend with her friends). I'm camping and am hoping that I don't retreat too inwardly which I also tend to do if I'm on anything. I'm shooting a vlog for my channel and want to be more extroverted and make some new friends in the process.
Coachella,fdpkaul,t1_fdpdnxb,1578630967.0,I'm really hoping he doesn't pull a Kendrick Lamar and release the new album the Thursday of Coachella. I fell in love with Damn. but didn't get to really digest it before watching him live and didn't know any of the lyrics. He did an amazing performance but damn I wish I knew the music better beforehand. It made it a bit harder to get into the set since everyone was more watching/listening than singing along
AskReddit,fdpbe9w,t1_fdp4vp8,1578624414.0,"yeah that was one thing that I wasn't a fan of Hilary. She didn't have much of a set plan (trump didn't either). Her biggest pro was that she wasn't Trump and Trump's biggest pro was that he wasn't Hilary. I hate both of those candidates. Hilary won the DNC Primary because she essentially paid for it because she paid off the DNC debt and is why Bernie didn't win despite having a lot more support. Here's an article on how Hilary took over the [DNC](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774).

I will say an unpopular opinion but Trump has done good. I'm not saying that he's only done good because HOLY FUCK he has not done that. He's fucked up in a lot of areas and honestly just needs to shut the fuck up. I've had people say that they're voting for him again because of those good but like can't you find another candidate who does that same good without all the bad attached to him. I hate when my conservative military side of the family are super loyal like scary loyal to him especially cause he did good for the christian people at the expense of other people.

As for Hilary, I was scared. She was super pro-war and wanted to get involved with Syria and chances are we would've gotten into something with Russia or North Korea with her. I joked around that she was my favorite republican because she was more moderate and ""pro-business"" but she wasn't one for the people either. Had she been elected I honestly believe she would've gotten away with a lot more than Trump did. At least with Trump I knew that the media would not let him do a single thing without being criticized and that it would lead people to try and become more aware of what's actually going on in our government.

The one thing I believe we can all agree on now is that there is something severely wrong with our system of government. The only way to really fix it will never happen due to corporations and lobbyists paying our leaders and influencing it like crazy. There's no way that's going to happen. Our healthcare system is horrible because of corporations. Our military spending is so ridiculously large that if we put at least 5% of it toward education it would help tremendously and even help us secure our future as a country. Education imo is fucking up our economy and creating a bigger divide in social class because it's become mandatory for middle class and some lower class to get into large amounts of debt in order to even work. That debt should be money flowing into the economy and is why a lot of company's are going under or being bought out by larger companies. All that leads to mental health problems which we have a huge crises on. The thing here is that Hilary honestly wouldn't have helped with any of this since she is owned and did a lot of shady ass shit with the Clinton Foundation. 

Trump was a wildcard and now we know that he just turned into an extreme version of the Republicans that the Republicans couldn't control. He seemed more isolationist until the impeachment stuff made him go a bit crazy and poke at Iran. 

Both sides need to get their shit together and so far with this upcoming election it doesn't seem like they will. So it's going to be another lesser of two evils debate. before the Iran debacle he seemed to be ahead in the polls. Please dems don't let Biden be your main guy. Bernie 2020 please."
Coachella,fdm1uzj,t1_fdjivsk,1578537816.0,[The Hubb](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGLPoasLa5DzhGwQmxs-SSA) . We actually just released a video about Coachella and its owner. I'm the guy in the colorful shirt.
Coachella,fdjch2t,t1_fdiiv9c,1578465241.0,"There's something artistic about how it looks. It's super easy to film something in 4K but to capture it on film is a whole other thing. Even the loss of ""quality"" really defines it and makes it stand out. It means someone put in the effort to capture it. I love that you were able to do it and I'm down to meet up. I'm planning on bringing a disposable camera per day and doing some vlogs for my music channel."
Coachella,fcwp2wf,t3_ej9ik2,1578032226.0,WTT 1 Weekend 1 ticket or WTB 1 Weekend 1 Ticket. I bought my sister a ticket for Weekend 2 for her college graduation gift but apparently all her friends are going to Weekend 1. Does anybody WTT for a Weekend 1 or sell a weekend 1 ticket?
dating_advice,fctlvbh,t1_fcrtubx,1577948173.0,"hell I don't even believe that is the issue. The problem is that chances are these girls aren't interested in a relationship and it might be pretty obvious to them that you want one. Another thing that you could change is how you escalate but then again it comes down to what do you want? I know I give more relationship vibes than casual dating vibes but my intent normally is to eventually get to that point. Some girls will appreciate that, others don't want that yet. But it comes down to what do you want."
microdosing,fbak0c1,t1_fb85mg6,1576680161.0,"shrooms and other psychedelics aren't a cure but they can facilitate the neuroplasticity to make the changes needed to get better. I believe one can get to the same place without it but it may just take a bit more time and effort. It's good that you were putting in the effort to get better. A lot of people do psychedelics and don't put the lessons they learned into practice. For me psychedelics showed me what made me unhappy in life and it just became more apparent when i returned to my regular life so I had to make changes. Like you getting that work/life balance, working through emotions, finding healthier relationships/friendships, and even seeing a therapist helped me.

BUT i will say there was a point in my life where I sought the good feelings and used it as an escapism which led to me experiencing psychosis, so beware. I've since learned to respect the drug and know that it is not for everyone."
askseddit,fa82740,t1_fa7zl3k,1575840347.0,"I personally don't think he should talk his feelings out. I say start escalating and seeing her reactions first. Build it up a bit and see what she is comfortable with and at a certain point she'll for sure realize what his intentions are especially if they start getting touchy. Talking about it from my experience takes away from the build and if she's unsure about her feelings she may get weird.

This does not mean you shouldn't ask her out. If you ask her out she'll know that you're interested. Just don't try to label it and ask her to go the next step. it's weird and feels unnatural. Just ask her out and escalate."
askseddit,f9corzz,t1_f94tfp1,1575225853.0,"Yeah. I tend to meet the people I date through friends and mainly through my my female friends. I've asked them to introduce me before but they either don't believe i'd mesh well with their friends (even though I often do) or their friends aren't single. My best friend wingwomans me and talks me up to womenand it's been fun. I normally just approach but sometimes she's so social that she's often talking to someone who is my type. For parties, I'm usually the one who is the planner of the group especially now that we have to plan our get togethers but because of that they do invite me to their parties but again since most are in relationships their social circles are smaller for some reason.

What's nice is having a strong social circle when i go out and the fact that my group of friends is heavily mixed including gay/lesbian couples that when I do go out I have social proof and that has helped me pick up girls in the past. We have a great time and I enjoy being around them so I don't feel pressured to perform and my authentic self adds to the party. I feel like this has helped getting me into the right mindset and makes me more approachable"
askseddit,f949i8z,t3_e3opbx,1575081373.0,"You know your social circle best. I'm the only single one in my friend group and the rest are currently engaged or married. For some reason a couple of them live vicariously through me and some just use it as a reminder as why they don't want to be single. Most just want me to finally meet  someone so we can go on double dates and have me not me the 3rd/5th/7th wheel at events.

So I've learned to only say what I am comfortable with them knowing and am willing to talk about. Most don't need to know about every single hookup and I often don't use names but nicknames as to not attribute any names to them. Some of the girls however are into finding them online to get a better picture of who the girl is. There was one girl who would get mad and talk shit about me whenever she heard about a new girl for some reason. She was super against me specifically having hookups and even told our friends to stop talking to me. I think she was insecure that I'd make her boyfriend want to go back to that world but ultimately it was her insecurity that led their breakup but that's a whole other story.

So again it's about what you're willing for your social circle to know and you should have an idea of how most of them would react and their level of comfort. I personally don't go into too much detail unless asked for detail. at most it goes like ""I hooked up with Tequila girl at X event and it was good/meh/fun/etc..."". Some of the girls pry for more details and most of the guys are like ""nice"". If they're talking about me and I'm not comfortable I communicate it to them and if we're friends then chances are they'll respect it."
