For several of them i had pinkeye too. The doctor at one point told me that i had “viral pinkeye” and i asked why the hell i keep getti g the same cold over and over and she told me that i was probably contracting the numerous adenoviruses and coronaviruses that are more prevalent in daycares that i maybe hadnt been exposed to much before, on top of the rhinoviruses and all that stuff. thats the first i heard of any of that. 

i think i mustve gotten thru all of them bc after 2.5 years of nonstop illnesses i was healthy for the next ten months - until i got a month long illness this march that may have been corona not sure. But i digress, i hope the thing with the coronaviruses can help out"

My husband and toddlers and i have followed everything to a tee and have had virtually no exposure to the outside world. my husband is the only one to leave for groceries and he does the mask and clorox wipes and ha d sanitizer and all that.

my parents have been pressuring us to see the kids lately. so ill have them over two of the next weekends to see the kids. i figure i can be fairly confident we dont give them this illness if i squeeze them in before we all go out. but honestly once the kids re in daycare and im back at the offi w im gonna keep us all away from the parents again for a few weeks after that to see how all this mess transpires."

I have always considered daycare the biggest threat to spreading covid for our family - daycares are a germ factory and the kids’ families are connected to them and who else and its just a huge vulnerability. So yes i am worried. But i also have been doing a limited work schedule (6am/7am to noon) and my husband 1230 to 6 or so. its been going well but it is exhausting to have no time for myself. get up to go straight to work, cram stuff in a short period of time, and then try to keep a 2 and 3 yo quiet and happy for 6 hours with my husband on calls. i dont get housework done or anything during that time bc we cant have free reign of the house. then we eat dinner and let the boys play a bit then by thentime the boys get to bed im exhausted. 

i have no me time and the house is so so messy with us here all day. and the boys are acting out a LOT lately. i took my 3 year old on a hike saturday when the park opened. he saw a (closed playground) and said he wants to play on “playground 3” with his friends. thats daycare. and then on our hike - just me and him - he was so sweet and happy. the constant whining and tantrums went away and he was like a totally different kid. ill take our 2 year old out on a “date” this weekend.

HomeImprovement,fqe9bop,t3_gia8d2,1589303853.0,"Our lawn is absurdly perfect because my husband is obsessed and he could probably write you a novel on what to do to it. And some other people have offered some suggestions. 

I will say that one of the big ones is to mow often, on a higher setting. Our neighbor across the street took my husbands suggestion to heart this spring while in quarantine - high setting 2x a week, before a rain if possible, and his lawn looks noticeably better. 

Another tip is to reduce lawn as much as you can. While its nice to look at, grass IS extremely expensive and time consuming and wasteful to maintain. 

For our garden we try to stick with bushes, trees and perennials. If you notice that certain plants you have do thrive with little work, try to get more of those where theres room. there is a certain type of hydrangea that the builder put in at many of the houses and theyre all doing well. Ive also noticed that some houses in our subdivision who have magnolias in full sun and those are all doing well. so when we added garden bed to the fullsun side of our house, we bpught the same kinds of hydrangeas and junipers that were doing well already, and also planted a magnolia.

and finally, experiment with free or low cost plants sometimes if you can. For example, the peonies were all so pricey at the nursery and hardware stores. So i got $5 clippings at the plant sale fundraiser a local nature preserve puts on. And I got a free sapling at an arbor day 5k the first year we moved in. It is a river birch. I read they like water so i planted in our yard at the bottom of the hill where it gets damper. That was five years ago. It’s nine feet tall now. A neighbor gave us part of their hydrangea when it got too big. some of it takes some experimentation and observing whats already working around you.

We live in an area where there is no water shortage so we water fairly liberally in late summer. 

Keep up with pruning."

unpopularopinion,fpv2kgk,t3_gfm0hk,1588932595.0,"it has to do with child development. telling people you have a 2 year old actually tells them very little because thibgs change so rapidly. the older you get the less it matters.

when youre six and somebody says “hes six” they can get a pretty good odea as to where u are developmentally. when youre 42, “i am in my 40s” can tell someone all they need to know. 

once a kid gets to about 3 people tend to just use their year, but if i say “i have a 24 month old” and “i have a 2 year old” those can mean very different things. as can 1 year old - 12 months and 18 months are quite different. my 3 year old didnt talk yet at his 2nd birthday or know his colors or sleep thru the night steadily. but when he was 2 but really 2 years, 11 months hes speaking full sentences and has a huge vocabulary, is partially potty trained, etc. 

i think it depends pn the context too. its a subtle distinction if someone is asking a kids age where that all is relevant. for example if i am talking to a work colleague and they would ask how old my kids are i always say “1 and 2” or “2 and 3”’ or whatever. its more about satisfying their answer with a message that says “i have two toddlers.”

but if i exchanging stories with someone and there developmental level of the child is relevant, even on a subtle level, then it may make more sense to say “my son is 13 months and he isnt walking that much yet.” or whatever.

i generally wouldnt ever say any of that after 1 year; i always tended toward saying things like “a year old. a year and a half. almost three” whatever. but i totally get why its said. a one year old can be a relative blob that says nothing and cant even walk bc theyre 12 months old, or it can be a kid ridingg a tricycle and speaking full sentences because theyre 23 months old."

I understand about the vaccine. this one will be pushed thru quickly. even if just the adults all get it in year one and the kinks get ironed out after that, itll be a huge help to stoppung the spread. and unlike polio this doesnt widely attack children. with polio it was worth the risk for kids to get on it quick but not so much for this"

blogsnark,fptntms,t1_fptmvxn,1588894760.0,"The weirdest symptom i had was extreme dizziness I first got sick Wednesday, February 26 and I remember the exact moment it hit me pretty hard and on Monday morning March 1 I woke up and I was so dizzy I couldn’t even stand up it felt like I had been taking shots at the bar all night and I crawled to the bathroom and sat there for quite a while before I could take a little bit of a shower and then I went to urgent care. She gave me antibiotics and she said my ears were fine so that was really weird and I was getting dizzy spells until about April 2 or third. they got less severe. over the course of March but I had a few the first couple of weeks where I just flat out fell over. Then on March 16 was when I got a fever and it got really bad very suddenly between 10 AM and 11 AM that day and I had a fever for like three days and then it took the rest of March to taper off. And I did have pinkeye for the entire time from the day after I started feeling sick in February all the way to early April. 

so yeah mine coulda been any of the other viruses that give people colds and flus and sinus infections and all that, who knows. But the dizziness was SO bizarre and thats probably the longest I’ve ever been sick"

blogsnark,fptkz1w,t1_fptjtu5,1588893207.0,oh yeah! i was so sick the entire month of march. at the time i called my doc with shortness of breath and a fever on the third week of a sick ess i couldnt shake and the nurse just sounded annoyed and i had to argue with her to talk to the doctor. She finally agreed and calls me back and says “just stay home for two weeks or if you REALLY cannot breathe then go to the ER.” i felt kinda freaked out by that! and helpless. Today im sitting at starbucks drive thru and theyve got drive thru covid testing available to everyone who wants it across the street. Im sitting there thinking wow i wish i had that in march...
