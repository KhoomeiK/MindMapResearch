You need to deep clean everywhere they were. Them being confined to one room means absolutely nothing about limiting or controlling the spread. You need mattress covers on every bed in the house as soon as possible. 

Now that these guests are gone, any bed bugs they may have left will go searching for food. They will live any and every where, in/on any thing. Because you knew when they came, you can kill them off for good quickly and easily. But please take me seriously, unless you want to be like me: 8 years after the infestation, struggling with sleep every night due to phantom bug crawls all over your body. 

Best of luck to you"

While we were genuinely poor she could apparently afford her cigarettes, weekends out at bars with friends, all the dinners out without us, and her lunches she would buy for herself while we sat around hungry. 

There was one morning I remember that she wouldn't let us eat anything. She kept saying we had a big dinner the night before so we didn't need breakfast. We did not have a big dinner the night before, she ate out and wasn't home when my siblings and I ate. 

I stole a poptart from the pantry and tried to sneak it into my room. She caught me and lost it. Screaming at me about how we are too poor for me to just sit around eating all day, and doing so for hours. Calling me a ""disgusting little thief"" who she didn't raise to be this way. and at the end of it she told me to ""get out of her sight for the rest of the day, she was tired of looking at a thief""  

I was not allowed to come home until later that evening. I was 12, and when I finally did come home she took my siblings out to dinner without me.

relationship_advice,fq5s001,t1_fq5e9zy,1589115853.0,"A little anecdotal evidence to further show that cps is a joke: 

As a small child my father relentlessly beat us. He whipped me (like actual whipping), I went to school with marks constantly. I was a very shy child to adults, and would only say as much as I needed to end the conversation. My kindergarten teacher would see marks nearly everyday, she was a bully so I think she just didn't care for a while, but the back of my shirt came up at recess one day. She sits me down and asks about the marks, and I answer honestly ""they're from when daddy gets mad at me"" 

Cps shows up, every child involved has marks. My mother has marks. The night before was so much worse because they call beforehand to let you know. They interviewed us all, including my mother, with my father in the room. When she asked me, I just couldn't answer. She asked to see my back and I showed her. Bonus points to them: my father was wanted for attempted infanticide in the 90s for my half brother, lots of evidence. He fled the state so he wouldn't be charged. All of this, and they still left my family with that man. 

On a side note, we left for a domestic abuse shelter that summer. My mother wasn't great, but I'm 21 and I live a very full, happy life. But cps in the US doesn't do shit, and everyone who's had a call for a real reason saw no repercussions."

whatsthisbug,fq0o38t,t3_ggdhcu,1589034983.0,"I'll just pop some minimal advice here, as well as what came from my experience: 

First of all, if you live in an apartment you need to tell your landlord immediately. They could have come from someone else's apartment and into yours. Your landlord will likely pay for the treatment to get rid of them in this case. 

Now is a great time to get rid of every item that does not matter to you, everything that does needs to be cleaned. They can live in ANYTHING. When my family had an infestation, we were at the laundromat washing all our clothes (industrial dryers get incredibly hot, enough to kill bed bugs very quickly). My sister was sitting reading her book, turned the page and a bed bug fell out. The same day, I removed my hanging mirror from the wall to clean it and there were a few hiding behind it. I mean it when I say anything and everywhere. 

If anyone has stayed at your home recently, you need to tell them. 

The most important item for you to buy is a MATTRESS COVER. I cannot stress it enough. It will allow you to keep your current mattress and prevent further infestation. Every mattress you own from this point on should have one, even if it's just in case, and especially if you live in an apartment. 

From my own experience, there was only one treatment that worked. The heat treatment, it is expensive. But if your infestation is really bad, it's going to be the only thing that works. You can tell the intensity of your infestation by looking at the corners of your bare mattress first, and any of the areas listed [here ](https://cdn.domyown.com/images/content/where_do_bed_bugs_hide.jpg)

The mattress corners are the most obvious spot for bed bug markings, which look like [this](https://pesthacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bed-bug-feces.jpeg)

I urge you to act fast. It took my family too long to get rid of them (mostly because my mother wouldn't acknowledge the problem, and kept belittling it). These are serious monsters, and will test your patience to no end. I am now stuck with phantom bug crawls at night for possibly the rest of my life because of my mother's negligence. I will get the feeling of bugs crawling on me, which does not stop until I touch the spot. This can keep me from sleeping, and it can make me incredibly stressed at night. 

I don't wish this upon a single person, but the faster you act the easier it will be to get rid of them. And remember, mattress cover TODAY. Best of luck to you"

It will not stop at you, OP. There's a second option after it stops effecting you, he will turn to your child. And the fact that he was already unafraid to do it only makes me more sure. 

He will apologize tomorrow, and he will seem to really mean it. He doesn't. All the times he tells you it'll never happen again, they're not true. All the times he tells you he'd never hurt your son, they're not true. 

Leaving today changes everything, but most importantly your child is young enough to be able to recover almost untouched by the trauma of watching that happen. You and your son both need to get to therapy the moment you've settled away from your husband. The longer you wait, the more emotional damage will grow in your son. 

So yes, you deserve better. But if that's not enough for you, then do it for your son."

relationship_advice,fj9psuv,t1_fj7e1cr,1583156442.0,"Is that his only reason? Because you don't do it for him? 

From what you've insinuated, I have past trauma of similar nature as well. He's withholding from you because you are can't perform in that aspect for him. Your trauma makes you unable, you can't help it. In a way he's punishing you for your trauma. 
Your partner is not just selfish in bed, he's an asshole. If it were just something he was uncomfortable doing, that's a boundary and you'd respect it. But from what you've given it sounds like he is even more selfish than originally described in bed. 

Your trauma is a part of you and if he can't respect it, than you need to rethink your definition of what respect in a relationship actually is. 

Sex is a big part of most romantic relationships. It's emotional and physical. he's refusing to work with you on what you like. He gets mad when you just do it yourself. He doesn't seem to want you to enjoy sex. It's impossible for a fully grown 24 year old man to ""not understand"" what you're explaining. He simply doesn't care. You deserve to be treated better."

whatsthisbug,fioytxe,t1_fios00i,1582594178.0,"Unfortunately, even if it just fell it could be one of many that did. And even worse, if you have a single female bed bug in your home you have bed bugs, and that appears to be a female to me, but anyone please correct me if I'm wrong. 

Side note: I know I comment the same things on all bed bug posts but they always need to be said to the new comers so sorry to our regulars. 


Clean every inch of your home, throw away anything you don't need or care about. follow every step on the link I saw someone provided. But if those don't work, you're gonna have to bite the bullet and go for the heat treatment because that was the only thing that worked for me. 

If you live in an apartment complex, you have to let your landlord know. It could be from a neighbor, and if it is then the whole place needs treated and your landlord is responsible for that. This protects you, and everyone in your building from having to pay individually as well. Have your gf inspect her space as well, just to be thorough. 

If you get rid of furniture at any point during this process, make sure you clearly label it as infected. Even if it is just a bookcase, they can get everywhere. 

In the future, thoroughly check every bed at hotel/air bnb/etc you stay at. The easiest spots to check for bed bugs are the corners of the mattress, and look like [this ](https://images.app.goo.gl/pEu99Y56ZFWr4Gmk6) 

This is not at all meant to scare you, I had a horrible infestation and do my best to help anyone finding out about theirs. The fact of the matter is yours is more likely to be easily dealt with if sighting one of the demons is your first sign. I just want to provide as much info as I can so you're best prepared. 

I hope this helps, and most of all good luck to you my dude."

relationship_advice,fiaishn,t1_fi9t6ya,1582301907.0,"This is the #1 thing I was going to say as a fellow victim. Let her come to you, don't rush the conversation but be ready when it comes. 

Give her emotional space, and time to process. But let her know, however the two of you can best communicate, you're ready when she is. There's a lot of processing happening between and within the two of you. Take this time to process your own feelings too. 

But most of all, when the trial comes you NEED to be there. The defense is going to do everything they can to discredit her, put her down, make her out to be a liar, and gaslight her to make her stumble and mixup her memory. This will probably be the worst of it, especially if they have other people come in to protect his character."
