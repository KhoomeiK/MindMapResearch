Until then, I allways suggested the pizza box trick to my colleagues and musicians, and though they are sceptical in the beginning, they too get bamboozled.

Also, when you light up the flash light, the whole gun lights up like the light source ilumitates the gun, if the tip was the light source, the whole gun would not light up. Best seen with the rocket launcher.
