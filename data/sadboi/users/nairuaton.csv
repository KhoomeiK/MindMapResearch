PublicFreakout,fdvkb5o,t1_fdv6lln,1578748331.0,"I agree. I didn‚Äôt realize until I was 12 or 13 that I was molested when I was 4. I can‚Äôt remember the face, the voice or the smell of him. When I look back on those memories, the events and setting are crisp but it‚Äôs like I blurred him completely out of my head. I‚Äôm grateful  for that though."

relationships,f8aeldf,t1_f8adehl,1574395122.0,"I meant ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù as any kind of questioning in a relationship. I‚Äôm still in the relationship and I think the more we grow together, the less the questioning affects me. It was a struggle at first because I am most definitely in love with my partner, and I grew up with the idea that two people meet and then you automatically fall in love and it stays that way forever, which isn‚Äôt the case. Everything isn‚Äôt as it seems. The more you trust your partner, and the more you grow together and individually will help you understand that every marriage, whether that is a year together or 30+  years, has had its doubts at some points. Also that it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs normal. I am still learning and I still have my moments where I freak out and blame myself. It‚Äôs cheesy, but if they want to stay, they will. If they wanted to leave, they would‚Äôve."
relationships,f8acxi0,t3_dzuwsm,1574393847.0,"I‚Äôve been in a similar situation and what I learned is to go with the flow, love unconditionally without expecting anything in return, and know when to give space. I‚Äôm a needy person in general so understanding when to give space and when to hold on was probably the hardest thing I had to learn. Everyone questions, that‚Äôs part of being human, and it helps to talk it out. If she‚Äôs comfortable telling you her thoughts/doubts then it‚Äôs easier to talk through feelings and work through the inevitable."

BPD,f775no7,t3_dud972,1573444659.0,"This is too close to home. Loneliness follows me everywhere, even the places I‚Äôm the happiest, I still have some hope that it will go away. I‚Äôve dealt with this since I was in junior high, and things only got worse when I fell in love but I‚Äôm trying to take care of myself and it helps. I wish you luck."

getdisciplined,esdiy2w,t3_c6v0l1,1561858835.0,"This helped me so much. Life has seemed so shallow and I‚Äôve found myself getting angrier and not being able to control it because I‚Äôm not being productive in any way. This right here though, this is the ‚Äúpush‚Äù I needed."
relationship_advice,esd9fdk,t1_es8vzlx,1561850843.0,"We talked about it, and he explained why we needed the time. We both understand what caused it and we have set a time in a few weeks to talk about everything again. He‚Äôs mentioned multiple times that he wants to definitely get back together and try it again when we are both equally happy ,individually, and share that when we are together. I appreciate this feedback so much! My anxiety ignores that he wants to get back together in awhile and tells me the complete opposite."
