I work in a very very noisy office, with people talking really loud, horns and even one of those chickens that you smash and they make a high pitch noise and they use it all the time. Honestly investing in my Sony XM3 was the best thing I did and I can work despite all the noise."
PanicAttack,fj4uscs,t3_fbhz2h,1583017385.0,"I'm on the same boat as you. I've started therapy and seeing a psychiatrist because of it, and right now I'm on Luvox, and Klonopin when I have an intense panic attack. It got like 85% better, but there are times in which I will still panic because of these thoughts. My therapist has given me some tools to help me manage and the most effective one I've been using lately is listening to philosophy podcasts while at work. It makes me feel less alone to listen to other people talking about the same questions that I have and, consequently, less anxious because I know I'm not going crazy.
If you want to PM me too, feel free."
SkincareAddiction,fiy1d5p,t3_fa1uem,1582830558.0,Mine as well! I take medication for OCD and since then it has helped a lot with my skin :) Especially because I've stopped picking it all day long and I can sleep better (somehow lack of sleep gives me the worst skin ever). The only down side for me is that I've lost a lot of weight and it's been difficult to put it back on.
PanicAttack,fheo7th,t3_f2qeby,1581526496.0,"I always feel really really tired, like I just exercised a lot so I feel sore, especially on my legs - which get pretty tense and I have a lot of spams on them."
Existential_crisis,fgfibt2,t1_fge8tgl,1580739538.0,"I'm doing so much better with the medication, but some days are still hard.

I've talked about hallucinations with my therapist (because one of my fears is going insane), and he said that hallucinations are usually small things like a shadow or a sound, or seeing an object and confusing it with another similar thing... But that our brains are not sophisticated enough to create a person or, for example, a whole family and talk to them. This would be an incredible difficult task for our brains to do, so he reassured me that I'm not going insane haha.

I have not had a panic attack since Christmas and I'm slowly getting used to the feeling of not being able to answer my existential questions."
OCD,fg6kez5,t3_ewcfyu,1580570318.0,"Hi! So this is my first medication as well, and I've been on Luvox for 3 months. The first weeks I had  a loss of appetite and lost some weight due to it (good thing though cause I needed to lose some haha) and the worst side effect for me was the sleepiness. But it went away and now I am feeling like my old self but without the obsessive paralyzing thoughts, so all good! Antidepressants don't change your personality. They may make you feel a little ""dull"" for the first weeks until your brain gets used to the new amount of serotonin, but it will pass once it does. I can say I feel 95% better with it. Of course I still have the thoughts, but I have my life back and can enjoy things I couldn't before, so it has been really helping me."
Existential_crisis,fep1igr,t3_eq7krd,1579310045.0,"What kind of hallucinations have you experienced? I'm on the same boat with the OCD as you, and mine is Pure O. Since November it has changed its theme to the existential questions and honestly, it's been the worst kind of obsession I've ever had. I panicked for 4 days straight after taking too much caffeine at work and ended up in the psych ER. I experienced derealization and depersonalization, which made me panic even more. My psychiatrist then prescribed me fluxovamine (a SSRI) and clonazepam (this one to take only when I'm having panic attacks) and it's been a life saver for me. The thoughts have been way less strong and some days I don't even obsess about anything. Are you on any kind of medication? If not, it might help alleviate the symptoms a bit. Of course my psychologist has been helping me A LOT too."

I have had panic attacks and anxiety crisis since my teens and I have never told them because I was afraid it might be a mental health issue and I didn't want to bother them with it. Turns out that at 30 I had the worst panic attacks of my life (I had several consecutive panic attacks for 4 days) til the point I ended up in the ER and then I had a psychiatrist see me. Now I'm on meds and I regret so deeply not telling them when it started way back then because I'm sure if I had started treatment before, I wouldn't be as bad as I am today."

But the panic is different. I was walking back from work one day and out of nowhere, everything started feeling distant, as if it wasn't real. I got freaked out and spent 4 days having panic attacks all day long and ended up in the ER. I got evaluated by a psychiatrist and started taking clonazepam and fluxovamine for OCD. And sometimes I am back to myself, but other times, I keep wandering how is this all so weird and the panic hits strong. From then on, it is a trip straight to hell with my brain."

Well, let me tell you: you can get it as an adult and it is HELL. I got it from my nieces in January 2018 and I still have nightmares about it. Sometimes I wake up very anxious and scared because I'm looking at my hand and seeing all the sores again. I lost my finger nails, I couldn't stand on my feet for days and I didn't eat for 3 days - my mom made me drink all sorts of juices cause it was the only thing I could swallow. There is no medicine for the symptoms and you just have to wait 7 days with burning hands, burning feet and the insides of your throat on fire while your body tries to get rid of this hellish virus."
