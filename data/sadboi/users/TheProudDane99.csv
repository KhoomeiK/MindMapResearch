Take the Danish for example, it would have stopped charging if it where pulled that much out, there would be plastic on the first part of the two prongs.

depression,f4k29lt,t3_dkpj5c,1571632787.0,"Feel the same, except I have told two of my closet friends.
I'm a man and one of the friends is also a man, so I get this ""men don't talk about problems"" thing. And he just says I feel you every time, I guess he don't know what to say.

The other friend is a woman.
She is easier to talk to and really want to help, but I just feel like a giant burden for her and I don't talk about my problems if I don't have to. I don't want to pull her down with my sadness, so I just hold it in.

And the anxiety doesn't help and is probably the thing telling me I'm just a big burden to others.

Hope you get someone you can talk to, and actually talk to, not like me."

Think about it. Maybe it's better then killing yourself."

Same as you the only intimate time I've had with a women is a hug, I'm just so nervous that I can't do any thing right that I can't only love someone I know and sadly I only got one girl friend, which I'm madly in love with. But she has a boyfriend and I can't see us really being together but that's the thing I want most in life.

That's also a big reason for my depression. Just the realisation that I'm never going to be with anyone because I'm to afraid is killing me, almost literary.
I've had a lot of suicidal thoughts, but I know that I can't do it, it would make me think that everyone would think that I'm a (sorry for the language) pussy and what would me parents think. They don't know anything.

My biggest problem is that I think to much of w what everybody else think. That probely be my undoing. 

Sorry I don't got anything good to say. But you're not alone.

I always feel like I'm a burden to the people I'm together with, I have a boring life why would they want to hear about that, I only work and then get home alone to sleep.

And they few times I get invited to party's I just sit in the corner because I can't small talk.

The only way I'm getting a gf is if the girl is approaching me and asking me questions, and after that I guess I just seem lame.

Sadly alcohol doesn't work for me, I have never tried drugs and I don't want to go too a therapist because my dream job requires a""healthy"" mind.

We're still friends but I can't think of anything else. Thank God I have a job that can help get the thoughts away from her it's hard.
