depression,evrxwja,t3_ckvcob,1564722098.0,"My wife was a big girl. I don't know dress sizes so I couldn't tell you that. I used to tell her to do the best she could with her eating. I didn't bring it up unless she did. She loved me for me, and I loved her for her no matter what. No-one gains weight in a day so you can't lose it in a day either and quick fixes never last. Also you'll be the size that's right for you. Real people don't look like what you see on tv. Take small steps and don't give up. We're rootin' for ya."
depression,evrvsdx,t3_ckvfej,1564720067.0,Meds if you're on any can kill your appetite.
depression,evrv653,t3_ckvk57,1564719512.0,"If you are seeing a doctor and have a diagnosis of depression ask the doc if you can file FMLA papers. That will cover you when you have a ""just can't today"" day. Also give you some ammo against that asshole boss. Picking on someone with a medical condition can get him fired. Been there done that. Being ill doesn't mean you can't stand up for yourself. Besides it's fun to be mean. Might help you feel a little better."
depression,evru7r5,t3_ckvujf,1564718661.0,Think about it this way and stop beating yourself up. That paper was just some office person's best justification for their job. All the sudden you're not pathetic. They went to college and some moronic sheet encouraging everyone to lie is the best they came up with? Gimme a f****n' break!
depression,evrtc10,t3_ckw18m,1564717880.0,"Yeah I'm on venlafaxine. 150 mg er. It makes everything kind of ""so what. It doesn't really matter."" I don't get real down anymore but I dont care about anything or do anything much either."
depression,evrquo9,t1_evrp11m,1564715772.0,Ok. Thanx. Pistol behind the ear would be instant but messy.
depression,evrmc90,t3_ckxfem,1564712160.0,At least you got it off your chest here. We understand. Try to find professional help. Even if it's a smelly Geek of the Year award winner school counselor.
depression,evrl5zz,t3_ckxm1q,1564711255.0,"Yes, some people will judge you. I had to file FMLA papers at work and now if I call off because it's one of THOSE days I get the snub from some supervisors(stuporvisors?). I know it probably hurts you even more than you already are, but try to take it as THEIR ignorance. Please don't let tiny thoughts of mediocre minds add to your troubles. 
Gather your chi."
depression,euml049,t1_eumiakp,1563917078.0,Thanks. So you crave junkfood too? If I have cookies I eat the whole package at once. Wish there was a donut shop around here. Mmmmmm. Donuts & vitamins. That'll keep ya goin.
depression,euedmf1,t1_euec8a6,1563741732.0,I don't know what country you are in but if there is a U.S.A. or Canadian embassy or consulate there try to contact them. They may be able to help you. Please don't give up. There has to be a way to get you out of that place.
depression,eue8b4z,t3_cfwhsh,1563737900.0,"Beautiful memory. And you write so well. I'm an old hillbilly so not sure how it works, but have you tried facebook or any of those things? Anyways I think you could be a novel author or poet if you get some ""book learnin'"". 
Peace"

depression,eucvpqx,t1_eucc2ti,1563688703.0,"No, whoever sees won't have a nice life. Have YOU 
ever seen a suicide by gunshot? I have I worked in a morgue for 4 yrs. If you must shoot yourself please go to a pond or river, stand in shallow water facing such direction so the bullet, brains, blood and skull fragments do not endanger anyone else.  The mess will dissipate in the water. You may also wish to consider that the coroner will autopsy you. He/she will de-glove (that means peel off) your face and scalp, saw whats left of your skull apart, remove whats left of your brain, and leave it floating in a jar of formaldehyde for however long it's required to retain specimens in your state. Do you really want your family to deal with that? If the funeral home isn't ""competent"" enough to have a closed casket you'll be buried with a really creepy looking wax reconstruction face. Do you  want your family to deal with that?  Please give it some thought. I know how hard it is.  Depression patient myself for 16 yrs. Worse now since my wife died. But if I keep trying, you keep trying. If you keep trying, I'll keep trying.

WhatIsThisPainting,eucm3gv,t1_eucl812,1563679091.0,You are a scholar and a gentleperson. Wish I had half your brains! Live long and prosper.
WhatIsThisPainting,euckzgt,t1_eucjeag,1563678126.0,Wow! I've been googling and binging for a year or so and got nothing. Even tried reading Shakespeare but I'm too old and too hillbilly for that stuff. Thanks a LOT!
depression,euckawe,t1_eucj2op,1563677556.0,"Back to you. When it gets really bad remember that no one else would take care of your ""furry kids"" like you. They love you no matter what. I know it's hard to find the energy but please don't give up."

depression,euc7ups,t1_eubz0hd,1563667475.0,I dont have any people either since my wife of 33 yrs. died. But my old dog and my cat still love me. Go to a shelter and rescue someone. Help a lonely scared animal and it will help you too.
