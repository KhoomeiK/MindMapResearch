Jesus paid a high price for our sin, as long as you are covered by the blood of Jesus you can enter in!

Don't let the devil condemn you! I also believe having more joy in your salvation will make it easier to evangelize. Like I said, I have the same problem. I'm not naturally social.

From a Christian perspective, the real problem is sin, and both men and woman sin. MGTOW is mainly concerned in the ways women sin. 

This is a big reason to have a Christian spouse chosen by God as a Christian, as sin should be more controlled in these individuals who have a walk with Jesus. They won't be perfect, but they'll be a far cry from what MGTOW would imagine them to be. 

I get it. During my single years and trying online dating it made me MGTOW for a while, maybe as God's way of protecting me until I met my spouse. When I became Christian I ditched MGTOW because of how toxic it was, then I met my wife in Church, who understands the MGTOW mindset and redpill type of thinking. 

The main thing you need to do is trust God can provide you with a good wife. Christianity also puts pressure on couples to NOT divorce which is a really good thing. Trust God that he can provide you with a good wife, and have faith that things will work out for your highest good. Being in a bad relationship is worse than being single, however, being in a good Godly relationship is better than being single. 

May God meet you where you are at and bless you with a loyal, beautiful wife.

there are steps you can take. 

1. get rid of internet for a short time period if you can. i'd say maybe 3 months. get a flip phone in this period . do not allow yourself any access to the internet on phone or computer, if you don't have internet and have a flip phone there is no way you can access it in your house.

2. after that detox, get an accountability partner and app like Ever Accountable, the new version also has built in vpn based filter

what happened to me was that I did step 1 which detoxed me, then I did step 2 which puts pressure on you not to look or someone else knows, this is a good motivator. what really helped me was that I got married and now have a sexual outlet. it's been 2 years so far of being free. God also told me I could have him or porn, my choice. I chose him. i also saw that my wife saw it as a divorcable issue as it really hurts her, so I have motivation from there too.

q) Why do you allow evil?

a) human choice necessitates the existence of evil. 

q)Why do you allow people to go to hell if you are such a loving God? Why can’t you just reincarnate people or do something else?

a) For people who want nothing to do with God, God created a place to have nothing to do with him where they can go. Unfortunately, since God is love, light, water, peace, goodness, etc. hell is a place absent of these things. Since God is a righteous judge, his wrath is also poured out there, making hell an absolute terrible place. Since God is everywhere, to choose to not be with him he had to create a place he doesn't exist which is absent of all his attributes.

q) Why did you create the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil?

a) to test human obedience 

q) What happens to those who have never heard the gospel?

a) God will have mercy on who he will have mercy. God will have mercy on some, and pass over others, based on their desires to seek him and have relationship with him. After all, the stars and nature proclaim the existence of God. Would God not judge with right judgement according to those who have never heard the Gospel? The Gospel itself does make things easier on the believer, however, so it's important to spread the message far and wide still.

q) Why did you have to place us on earth to begin with? Why couldn’t we be born in heaven?

a) Earth was originally meant to be a paradise, and will eventually be restored to a paradise, and we will live on the new Earth forever, which will become heaven because God will dwell in it.

q) Why do you exist? How did you come into place? Why does the universe exist? How come it isn’t just all nothingness?

a) God has always existed eternally. God created the universe to show his Glory. Nothingness has no creative power, and nothingness would beget nothingness. God begets creation. Since there is a creation, there is a God.

q) Why are there so many different Christian denominations?

a) because humans aren't God, they fall short in their understanding of theology, and these different understandings create different denominations. Thank God however, we are not saved by our theology but by our faith and relationship with Christ, assuming you aren't in cult territory.

My question to God would be, how do you decide who to elect? That's a great mystery to me."

TrueChristian,fm2g2sz,t3_fslihk,1585696773.0,"So, there are a few things worth mentioning...

One) Hell was never part of God's original plan for creation, it was created to deal with the devil and his angels, who are ridiculously wicked. Hell / The lake of fire has to be bad enough to torment these fallen beings, who are stronger than us. It was never meant for humans, but when humans sinned, this was the only prison available for them to go to, and therefore they get the full torment this place was designed for.

>--Romans 11:29 - For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.

>--Hebrews 10:31 - It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

>--Romans 11:22 - Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God’s kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.


Two) God doesn't want any human to perish, and does not take pleasure in the death of the wicked. So, God created a plan. He created a covenant people for himself to save, and a Messiah that also could save us, and all those who trust in Christ Jesus who are elected since the foundation of the world WILL be saved.

Three) However, God is also a gentleman. He will not force his love on anyone, because that would amount to cosmic rape. He wants us to love him freely. Therefore he gives humans a choice to serve him or not. God did create us so that our highest good is in serving him, and apart from God who is all goodness, is everything terrible. Therefore it makes sense that those who don't choose God, get something terrible, because God is the source of all good things, like water, peace, light, and life. On top of that, God's wrath is poured into hell (as fire?).

Those who don't choose God, then, inadvertently choose eternal death. Perhaps they just don't fully understand the consequences of their choice when they rejected Messiah, or perhaps God has passed over them. God is holy, and God is just, and God is more concerned with being Righteous and Holy than all humanity just getting a free pass, and in the end we'll thank God for what he has done.

May to God be the Glory!"

TrueChristian,flsdmxc,t3_fqt8ih,1585439790.0,"Look at how much Jesus suffered for you! You are worth that much! :)

Body image is a temporary problem we have on earth, but remember in heaven we will have perfect bodies. Life on Earth is not supposed to be perfect, we struggle with so much. The struggle should remind us of the reality of a better land."
TrueChristian,flsd7ty,t3_fquhkk,1585439533.0,"That verse is talking about demonic realities. You should focus on being in Christ, or him being in you, and cast out any evil spirit in Jesus authority if there is any. It may be a struggle but only unrepentant sinners are going to hell after they die, while you live there is still hope, always."
TrueChristian,fls0yye,t3_fqdgu4,1585432042.0,"hell is eternal because of the debt we take on when we sin. if someone owes a debt and you throw them in prison for it, they can never get out because there is no way for them to pay it back while in prison. that's what hell is. thankfully Jesus paid our debt and gave us a positive balance. also why it's so important for us to forgive others, because of how much we have been forgiven."
TrueChristian,flrz6ga,t1_flrydco,1585430961.0,"God's getting ready to judge the entire world, I could see Covid 19 as sort of testing how we react. Will we turn to God in mass, or be stubborn, based on that we will see how God responds. Eventually he will purge the entire world with fire and then Christ will return. God has told me that he is moving towards judgement for America, I wouldn't be surprised if this virus plays into that. As to why he would want to judge us? Look at what culture we export, from Hollywood to prosperity Gospel, and all the babies we kill, and the promotion of promiscuity and homosexuality."
TrueChristian,flrxpcx,t1_flrx8nb,1585430069.0,"God's the same in both OT and NT and doesn't change. Also God is in control of every situation, the devil's on a leash. Covid 19 couldn't happen without God permitting it, otherwise he wouldn't be God Almighty."
