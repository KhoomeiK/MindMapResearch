Why? Because I had the feeling that her ex-husband knows exactly how to get her attention and seems to be a little narcisstic and manipulative. I don't know... maybe she could be a victim... some gaslighting behaviour is very hard to identify."

mentalhealth,fi8fpyq,t3_f71akw,1582239441.0,"At first, I was afraid of telling my therapist about my suicidal thoughts, too. But then I quickly realised that they can differ very well whether someone is actually willing and capable of doing it and who is „just“ desperate and doesn‘t have the guts to do it (like me, although I really mean it when I say it and although I have a very strong desire to stop existing). Well, I can only speak for Germany, but here it’s not that easy to hospitalize someone against their will, especially because therapists aren‘t doctors and the police isn‘t allowed to make this decision. 

Additionally, your therapist should be someone who you trust and to whom you can speak openly. Tell her/him about your fear of being hospitalized, I‘m pretty sure she/he will understand.

Good luck!"

mentalillness,fi1zeqz,t3_f5zupt,1582068021.0,Judged by the given information it could (!) be borderline personality disorder. Maybe you should have a look into that. I hope you'll get diagnosed soon as it helps to understand yourself a lot better. Good luck!
mentalhealth,fhz29c7,t3_f5jh4i,1581989204.0,"I think it’s pretty individual. If you two are getting along and if you don’t have the feeling that there’s something missing, there is no reason to change your therapist :)"

Especially the part about leaving the comfort zone... I never thought about it like this. I really have the feeling that I, in this very moment, made some crucial process and I will definitely discuss this with my therapist tomorrow. 

Wish I could help you, too. But maybe it already helps to know that you‘re not alone or only a „attention seeker“... and if you wanna talk about it, hmu anytime."

unpopularopinion,fhxn0o3,t3_f5a3dj,1581957991.0,Agreed. My mother is one of those people who don‘t „believe“ in mental health and that going to work and „enjoy life“ is the key to happiness. When I told her about my new therapist the only thing she did was rolling with her eyes and She is also talking bad about me going to a clinic for a couple of weeks. At the same time she doesn’t understand why I don’t tell her anything about my life anymore. The support of your parents is crucial.

unpopularopinion,fgsuzu7,t3_f08gk8,1581093216.0,"Thank you for this post. I am now almost 28 years old and I’ve been wanting to die since I was sweet 16. 

My longing for this life to end is sometimes stronger, sometimes I almost forget about it. But it’s always been there. It’s there not only because I had to handle very bad situations in my life so far but also because I don’t believe in the whole concept of life. That we are here, on earth, is a big accident. Life has no meaning at all, but humans tend to overinterpret every-FUCKING-thing. 

Please let those poor souls die when it’s their only and biggest wish without calling them out for being selfish.
