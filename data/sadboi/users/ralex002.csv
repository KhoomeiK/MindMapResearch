I graduated college in 2013 and struggled to make a living as a freelance reporter for four years. I worked as a staffer for one year for a very abusive editor, and it screwed me up.  The papers went out of business and I stopped doing journalism full time in 2017. I went through vocational rehab to learn new job skills and how to use my current skills in data entry and office assistant jobs. I’ve also been working through a staffing agency and have worked a few office jobs to put on my resume now. Before this quarantine, I began a city contractor legal secretary position that was supposed to be three months. But the city had to shut down three days into my job. Through my experience with vocational rehab and the temp agency, I gained a lot of confidence in myself and am learning to cope with my difficulties with autism spectrum disorder. However, I’ve never disclosed my autism or PTSD and anxiety disorders to an employer. It’s hard to do it in the right context."

Honestly, at this point I’m so tired of hearing people complain that they can’t go to the bar and have sex whenever. My significant other is an essential worker and exposed to the public right now. He’s at risk, and so am I. If you’re so horny it hurts, use any number of the sex cam sites out there to get off in front of strangers. When that’s out of your system,  read a damn book."
