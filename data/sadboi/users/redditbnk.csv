got out of an abusive 1 year relationship and met my current FP 7 months after, he treats me very well, is attentive, nice, gentle... everything.... but ive still noticed i am not my best self. iâ€™ve found the person i think i wanna be with for a long time but im reminiscing to those 6 months, i felt happier and free. i love being around people but i think the kind of relationship and obsession we get from dating our FP and being so close to someone is too much to handle. honestly idk what to do..."
