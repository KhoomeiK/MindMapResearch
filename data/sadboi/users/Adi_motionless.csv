depression,f6bdgvj,t1_f64zggl,1572772288.0,"I already did it several times. I know it's not good but I can't help myself but doing this, I just feel so worthless. I don't like my body since I was 15 or so (I'm 22 now),I hate myself for my own body and personality,  I am a very quite person and I always think that I am boring for everyone around me and that they are annoyed of me.
Like, Im not even sure if I have a personality at all.
I can't think of one thing that I like about myself.
When I go outside I feel like everybody is staring at me and that they think I'm just a nobody and a failure."
