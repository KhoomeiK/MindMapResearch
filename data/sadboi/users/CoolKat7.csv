UberEATS,fpyh5qe,t3_gg14kc,1589003802.0,I thought I was just lazy. Lol glad I'm not the only one who feels this. It's exhausting to do every day especially if you have a full time job
StarWarsLeaks,fpxd7vm,t1_fpj1owj,1588980381.0,Well you were half right! But he could still play Rex as well.
clonewars,fpwipqm,t1_fpvjcmf,1588964152.0,It's not happening. Those rumors are fan made and have no real traction.
StarWarsLeaks,fpul3mk,t1_fpsd2hd,1588915788.0,The man just needs his own trilogy. He can make something literally every generation would love and elevate star wars to a new level.

StarWars,fpppw1l,t1_fpppt2g,1588806861.0,Ahh i forgot about that. BS tho. Would've been insane if he appeared as a force ghost.
StarWars,fppp1lr,t1_fppms9e,1588806399.0,"Well, there was a rumor that Hayden was in talks to make a cameo in TROS so I guess I'll believe when I finally see it."

clonewars,fp8lbvf,t1_fp5yt7k,1588395371.0,"Yep. When we watched ROTS in theatres we all thought the clones were aware of order 66's existence the whole time. I don't mind the changes as imo they are for the better, but it wouldve been nice if it was this from the start."

lildicky,fp4vytf,t1_fp2lobr,1588308826.0,You talking about the MGK interview after his battle with Em? Because that was painful to watch.
lildicky,fp4vub4,t1_fp0o1z5,1588308729.0,"I honestly had no idea what was going on, especially after the ending of the previous episode. But about 4 minutes in I was in complete awe of what was happening. Lol"
vancouverwa,fp4dcom,t1_fp48jdm,1588296638.0,They're neck to neck
vancouverwa,fp4dbgn,t1_fp3rym8,1588296618.0,That's definitely true.
vancouverwa,fp4d9vi,t3_gb0xv8,1588296593.0,I was just there 15 minutes ago to pick up some Hawaiian Cafe. People were driving like idiots.
clonewars,foqoeex,t1_foqng9t,1587997825.0,The Droid arc was unwatchable to me.
clonewars,foqcbx9,t1_foqbfi1,1587989962.0,Lack of a big enough budget to show more movement and action for each individual clone is the only reason I can think of
clonewars,foqb7cw,t1_foq2sk3,1587989039.0,Agreed. Run straight and shoot 90% of the time.
StarWars,fonth68,t1_fominc1,1587926141.0,Dude that's nuts. Yes to the top half but no he doesn't need a hug. He'd stab you in the gut if you tried that and slam the food in your face when youre on the floor. He's a psycho who has a goal that makes sense. But he's an evil evil fucko that needs to be killed.
StarWars,fonsyqa,t1_fom4dqr,1587925855.0,"He's well past ""a hug"". Dude just needs to be put out in the pasture. He's a mad dog. Yes, his motive makes sense, but he's not enough of a good person or sane enough to ever achieve that goal."
StarWars,fonst0j,t1_fomcakc,1587925767.0,"Your missing the parts where he's a total maniac, slaughtering civilians and being a genuine terrorist. But yeah I get what you mean, he had a goal."
StarWars,fomffte,t1_fol6r09,1587888069.0,It's hard to watch for the first season or so. Very very kiddy. But I'm halfway through season 2 and the only reason I stopped was to wait until CW wraps up. Rebels is getting decent and I can tell it'll get better
StarWars,fomf5p4,t1_folzws9,1587887783.0,Ehh I'm sure it will apply to her. Although with that same train of thought they should've gunned down Anakin when they were given the order at the temple.
StarWars,fom3hs1,t1_folt4gq,1587877293.0,"Agree. Of all plot holes in the star wars universe this is the most glaring. How could you seriously not ever think to question that Palpatine may be a suspect, like at all? I hate thinking about it."
clonewars,foiuj3q,t1_foiughd,1587797464.0,"Blatantly going that route does piss me off 99% of the time, but ahsoka is different."
clonewars,foiteu1,t1_foievjx,1587796415.0,"I agree. And honestly I am in love with the decision. Ahsoka standalone movie , trilogy, tv show, cameo, video games, comics. Bring it all on. She's the future."
clonewars,fois24k,t1_foetxj6,1587795182.0,"Also, whose to say this doesn't end before TROS ends."
clonewars,foip1rt,t1_fogv549,1587792554.0,This entire arc will arguably be the most well-done product Star Wars has ever put out.
clonewars,foio00k,t1_fohsmaj,1587791688.0,I took it as that was her realizing the weight of the entire situation. Even she can feel the end of the clone wars is around the corner one way or the other.
clonewars,foinnii,t1_foilkde,1587791408.0,I saw this post and immediately remembered to turn it on. I was not dissappointed at all!! 10/10 bro

clonewars,foektub,t1_focwvof,1587706459.0,Yeah other than another Jedi being present that scene was hot garbage
clonewars,foejvrk,t1_fodbitc,1587705698.0,"You know you're like, only tricking kids. That's weird."
halo,fo3wi2i,t1_fo37z08,1587494125.0,Oh it's very true. Wed create the free silver accounts and give it a name that would fool the thirsty guys. Like SceneGirl69x and then use that account to go to our real profiles recent players and then spam until we find a biter. I think we even got a few credit card numbers that we were too afraid to use. Lol.
halo,fo1gck6,t1_fnzxavb,1587432690.0,Me and my buddy would pretend to be girls selling nudes. We would ask them for 3 months of Xbox Live in exchange for pics. We'd get the codes and then report their accounts. We were like 13.
clonewars,fnrkh2d,t1_fnqidfq,1587191827.0,"Maul does know pretty much all about the clones. When Savaage wakes him up he tells him something about the The Clone Wars. And mail responds with ""so it started without me?"""
clonewars,fnrkb24,t1_fnp973i,1587191669.0,"That was pure Star Wars, man. Beautifully done."
clonewars,fnqoge2,t1_fnogrnk,1587168746.0,"Totally agree with you. It also made me realize that this is the only real time Ahsoka and Rex probably see each other as totally equal. Plus, Rex gets old and has more fun after the war and into Rebels, while Ahsoka takes on even more responsibility throughout that show. It's interesting stuff man."
clonewars,fnqo32z,t1_fnqef31,1587168524.0,Yup! Same here. Like father like son.
clonewars,fnqnymo,t1_fno89hq,1587168450.0,I can't believe it was just 27 minutes tbh. I felt like I watched a damn good star wars movie.

whiskey,fnl446e,t1_fnjized,1587046596.0,Me and a friend of mine make sure we go out to get a drink of this once or twice a year. We've been doing that for about 6 years now. It's that good.
clonewars,fng2dmo,t1_fnfe5ba,1586920709.0,That's what I was wondering too. Unless him sensing her on coruscant was him on his way to the Outer Rim seiges.
StarWarsLeaks,fnesfav,t1_fneaz67,1586895025.0,"So would it be safe to assume that based on this current timeline, Anakin was probably on his way out to the Outer Rim Sieges when he sensed Ahsoka a few episodes back?"
GriseldaxFR,fnccarr,t3_g0ls3g,1586833330.0,Yeah I really want one but damn that price is steep.
StarWarsLeaks,fmw4ofs,t1_fmvvpqx,1586439458.0,Yeah that looks goofy. It's over the top in the sense of the ridiculousness of it. It's a taped up broken helmet.. lol

UberEATS,fm20mjh,t1_fm0bvsp,1585688434.0,"Your best course of action is to report it to Uber and explain the situation. Or have Uber cancel it for you.
