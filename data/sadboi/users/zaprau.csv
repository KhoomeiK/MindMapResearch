rupaulsdragrace,fjgsxzi,t3_fdc8tl,1583334835.0,I am lov-lov-loving the poly life! Everyone is so different and cute. One of the best parts is showering new people with random drag knowledge like bam! Yes gawd! Brown cow stunning! It's so easy to overload one person with drag references and I haven‚Äôt been lucky enough to meet anyone I wanna see who is as obsessed with drag as me yet and sends me drag memes back. üòÇ

rupaulsdragrace,feycv0b,t3_eqviwn,1579443889.0,I'm really enjoying being single again and figuring out what I want next for myself. I have never been more good to myself and putting boundaries in place with new people. I guess I'm just really proud of myself for all the hard work I've put in over the last few years. And I'm glad I didn't kill myself a few months ago when I was feeling too exhausted to start over again. I have met a few new good friends and two guys with a spark.. not trying to rush into a relationship but gosh it feels good to feel the potential there. Just living all my fantasies in the meantime üòÇ

JUSTNOMIL,f9mylhh,t1_f97ihfq,1575473125.0,So he said it's over and there is no point in discussing anything. I am beyond devastated.  He was not interested in hearing anything about what I have been thinking about and acting on during the separation. I am so distraught and don't know what to do now.

JUSTNOMIL,f97fcda,t1_f96jkao,1575164826.0,"We have an appointment Wednesday for relationship counseling after each having a solo session. We haven't properly spoken in around 2 months. I hope he realises what's happening but my MIL just keeps reinforcing that our marriage is failed and trying to gloss over it as over and done with, even in her reply to me today. I have never been more afraid in my life. My marriage is my rock, my husband is my best friend and lover and I will not let my fear or her interference allow me to walk away just because it's uncomfortable. I have never had to be stronger."
JUSTNOMIL,f95y3d9,t1_f95vha1,1575137041.0,She threatened to help him file a restraining order against me. She has me so afraid of reaching out to him as sich. He hasn't replied to a message I sent a few days ago and I'm afraid to even message again. I have no idea what to do.

I know with endometriosis there's always the chance it will grow back but hopefully I get some relief for a while. I'm really excited for our local pride parade tomorrow especially because we had a fab drag king win the annual competition and I can't wait to see him perform again.

RPDR_UK,f8azkux,t1_f8aw4yn,1574420511.0,"Totally agree. I think they cast The Vivienne to be the first winner (with her winning the previous UK comp) and gave DDC a super harsh edit in the final because they didn't want anyone to question Viv winning. Look at all the fan polls, Divina was the fan choice! Also absolute bollocks that Viv was always polished. Her win in the ape suit was an absolute mistake."

rupaulsdragrace,f76lkmy,t1_f7464mb,1573429611.0,I meant blue makeup. I got that it wasn't her skin color.
rupaulsdragrace,f72nmhj,t3_du0sxk,1573370429.0,I honestly enjoyed Blu over Viv in the challenge and runway. I laughed heaps at Blu's ad but cringed so hard with Viv's. If The Vivienne went on literally any US season of DR the judges would have read her to absolute filth for blue makeup on the face and no makeup on her neck or hands. Her look was among the worst I have ever seen on DR and looked more like it belonged on the drag on a dime episode.
vegetarian,f6pkj2i,t1_f6pgtds,1573058372.0,Food elimination is super easy but you should give it 2-3 weeks to see any lasting improvement. This is how I stopped eating lentils.

crazyexgirlfriend,f6ligp1,t1_f6l5nox,1572946837.0,"Love your mind. Thank you for this. My only modifications to your outline would be: 1, Stuck in a Car song has to be some kind of parody alt version of ""We Should Definitely Not Have Sex Right Now."" I don't see Greg leaving WC for good as his restaurant is so great, but I do see him opening a second Serranos in another city to get away but keep his newfound dream alive. Totally see Josh moving to Hawaii with his wife. What a great ending for him. The Tarzan song is 100000% something I need to see."

crazyexgirlfriend,f6kzlen,t1_f6k4rm4,1572924788.0,"Love your username btw. Agreed completely. I think that while Greg has changed and is more open and willing to do new things and try to have fun, and the core of his recovery is about not being driven by his cynicism and making that less of his identity.... and while I think in my fantasy he does get better at this, and Rebecca is a huge part of that journey.... for Rebecca and Nathaniel, this comes easily. And I feel she'll get to a point where she needs that as her dreams will pick up massive steam as she becomes more successful."
crazyexgirlfriend,f6kzcom,t1_f6jh513,1572924607.0,"I imagined giving grants as more of a thing like she goes on about how much she'd love to have her brother come out, he gives her brother a ""grant"" to live in LA and perform in her musical. The grant is also extended to other kids. I imagine it more as her presenting paths for her dream to him and he's like hey, I would love to help support that. I always imagined the ideas and successes were already hers and whatnot first and foremost. Less of a put money into her show thing."
crazyexgirlfriend,f6kz4xn,t1_f6kui8p,1572924446.0,"No he did do some petty things like take his gf to Raging Waters to piss off Rebecca and make her jealous, but they weren't together so it's not as bad?"
crazyexgirlfriend,f6kz231,t1_f6j2jn0,1572924386.0,Totally. I'm so obsessed with their chemistry. Although the start was problematic for them they grew the most together and individually I felt and stayed true to something in their core that was complimentary to each other.

BPD,f4rb0rp,t3_dleh98,1571765195.0,Told me she understands why I am the way I am after meeting my parents. That she understands the thoughts and feelings I have towards her are complicated as a result since she is my MIL. That she accepts I will always struggle with trust in our relationship and it's not personal to her.

BPD,f4r9mm4,t3_dlkul0,1571764696.0,I'm on Pristiq and Seroquel. Balances my mood shifts and reduces intensity of feelings. Think more rationally and more calm. I have more energy during the day and am able to sleep at night although nightmares are more intense.
BPD,f4r8zeq,t3_dled9z,1571764456.0,See your doctor for meds review. Lexapro made me suicidal and that is very common when increasing any dosage of head meds. Hang in there pal x

Being cancelled is a real problem especially when it's in relation to your primary source of income. She's not wrong to protect herself. It's scary. She's certainly allowed to comment on something that's affecting her industry and adapt to the reality of social media. She is still delivering killer looks and content even if her rawviews are not so raw.

BorderlinePDisorder,ewfkkp7,t3_cnxwa4,1565362928.0,"Yes nails, cuticles, fingers and feet. I can usually avoid picking at my feet by wearing socks and slippers at home. Hands are tougher. If it's cold wear gloves. When the urge to pick hits I have hand lotion nearby and apply it or I fidget with something. Video games keep my hands busy. Some days are better than others and it seems to come in cycles as once I start it's harder to stop as there are so many rough bits that are easy targets. I wish you and others strength in stopping this. I look back and see all the similar behaviors since I was little and I think I can narrow it down to shame around shaving/waxing my leg hair and nicking myself with the razor or getting a chemical burn. After this it was obsessively maintaining my eyebrows. Then my body hair. Then my hair. Then my weight. Then my cuticles/nails. Etc etc till the present moment. It doesn't seem so impossible when I put it into perspective but it will take a lot more work to recover."
BPD,evdjkev,t3_cjd06w,1564439801.0,The DBT skill effective rethinking and paired relaxation helps me a lot with allowing myself to enjoy downtime when my urges are to go/do. It's a great skill because it forces you to change your thoughts.
AmItheAsshole,evca3dd,t3_cj8qg9,1564410321.0,"YTA. I have a lot of mental health problems related to not being allowed to lock the lock on my door! Don't damage your daughter.

dbtselfhelp,eusjzh8,t3_chf52m,1564009482.0,DBT is different from any therapy I have ever done. It's a life skills class and it's the only thing that has ever given me genuine hope that I can really have a life worth living. It is hard and you really have to practice the skills if you want to rewire your brain. I know it's working because the people in my life tell me they see a difference. I cope better and don't make things worse as much. This will get better the more I practice. Wishing you all the best with your journey and I would suggest asking for some distress tolerance handouts you can use until October.

mentalhealth,erxcqs7,t3_c4i02g,1561380978.0,"There is and it is a beautiful service I have been so lucky to have used, and as such got the right diagnosis. Being in AND out of crisis when you get mental health services helps caregivers see the full picture. I only hope that this becomes more accessible around the world so we can all get correct treatment. The feeling of safety knowing the mental health crisis team has a file on me and I can see or call them and not get a random person on a hotline... it is absolutely amazing. I have used hotlines in crisis by the way which were helpful but I like that I can call and ask if my nurse is in or when she is in next ask them to have her call me to check in on me if I don't want to talk to someone else. And even if I don't want to talk they at least know the best way to calm me down because it is all in my file. The best part is that it is ten minutes from my house and they will just tell me to come in if I need it. Even if it's midnight. I am so thankful for this."
BPDrecovery,er1m3sb,t3_bzs2jh,1560433671.0,Most days I find it's just about having a LOT of different hobby options available and staying busy. If I can distract myself from the boredom I can distract myself from doing my problem behaviors as well. My DBT group keeps me feeling engaged and social and keeps me from engaging in more negative social interactions because between that and work that is plenty of social activity. I know I enjoy the things I am doing with even when it feels kinda forced. The trick for me is to try different options until one doesn't feel too forced to enjoy or lose myself in. I wish I had a better answer though.

AmItheAsshole,ep4sp2a,t3_btvqmi,1559045225.0,"NTA. The kind thing to do if you really love your fiance and want the relationship to work is to try to help her understand that you won't tolerate hate for your son from her or her family. If she doesn't accept him completely after this kind of conversation and reflection then she is never going to. She will always resent him and push you apart and try to exclude him from other things in your life because she will see him as less than a person. You know your son deserves better and so do you. If she ""gives in"" and says he can come after all then that is also not going to work out because she doesn't accept his sexuality and it is going to breed resentment."
