I definitely understand having people in another country you miss and want to spend time with, but it seems like you're all she has during quarantine, so she spent her birthday alone, While you could have came back and video called and played games another time.

You say you lost track of time, but it's kinda pathetic if you forgot about her and her birthday for an entire 8 hours and didn't even notice once because ""time flies"". All it does is communicate to her that she's not a priority to you."

You're only TA because you went out of your way to text her. That's not going to help your relationship with her or with your boyfriend if he genuinely is telling the truth and that she really is like a sister to him.  
But I definitely don't blame you for feeling weird about it. She can wear what she wants in her own home, but I'd never do that in front of any male friend of mine. It's kinda strange that she's doing it in front of you, too, unless she's trying to make a statement. They're either lying or they're weirdos, and if your boyfriend doesn't respect how you feel and calls you an insecure asshole for it,  then I don't think he's good for you."

i'm not sure if it was just because they hated me or something since their lifestyles were different from mine (they had been excluding me for weeks from anything they did) or if they genuinely thought i did it. i ended up getting to have my own single room after that, though, so there was a silver lining."

first, do you know WHY he dislikes talking on the phone? if he just says it‚Äôs the way he is, that‚Äôs just an excuse to be lazy. can you think of any underlying reason at all? Is he shy? Many people hate phone calls, but it can be remedied, ESPECIALLY if you like someone enough.
i had a similar problem. my boyfriend is a very nervous guy, and he always is scared of not knowing what to say; meanwhile, I loved talking over the phone because I felt a lot closer to him.

AskWomen,fjehaed,t3_fcuvg1,1583271639.0,"Sexual abuse & mental illness peppered in with religious guilt for intrusive thoughts about my abuse i couldn‚Äôt control. Spent many years of my childhood thinking that I‚Äôd be possessed by demons if I even considered sex. 
Years passed. Counseling helped, but counseling comes to a point where you‚Äôre tired of talking about it and it‚Äôs just reopening old wounds. Talking doesn‚Äôt help too much in practice.
I was made comfortable by my boyfriend. It started out very slow for the both of us- he considered himself asexual at the time we started really dating (back when we were 15), and I was not ready to face my trauma so we decided we‚Äôd avoid sex in our relationship, maybe pick it up one day. We had already been friends for almost two years before we dated. We spent months and months getting to know each other inside and out, our individual concerns with sex, etc. We slowly warmed up to the idea of sex, but were too shy to tell the other about our feelings due to fear of making it weird. Our conversations inevitably led us in more intimate directions after some time, and we began disclosing and discovering our turn-ons with each other. 
Knowing he had the same concerns as me and that he‚Äôd never do anything  to pressure me is what made me realize I was ready. I had a higher sex drive than I ever anticipated- we‚Äôre obsessed with each other and are constantly finding ways to get each other going.
The key for me was to find someone I trusted, who I knew would love me just as much either way. They‚Äôre hard to find, but boy is it worth it."

We started talking and realizing we had shared interests in movies and other games, too. It didn't start as a romantic relationship- we both liked each other, but thought we had no chance with the other person so we didn't let each other know until August 2016, when we were 15, and started dating. We have been on and off before since it was hard at times to be able to get to spend time with each other.  
I originally planned to first visit him back in July, but an airport-wide issue with fueling in Amsterdam forced me to turn around and go back home, and I was heartbroken. I kept at it, though, and we're meeting in 18 days.  It's definitely worth it. I get sort of jealous when I see my friends talk about and spend time with their love interests when they're right here with them, but I know that when we do actually get to be together, there's no way we're letting each other go.

I‚Äôm a bit shy to go to a church on my own, and most of my friends here don‚Äôt really want to go with me since it‚Äôs sort of, well, a party school- which makes finding a right place even harder, since i avoid people who are into that
(edit: it‚Äôs not because i think i‚Äôm better or anything, it‚Äôs just ovewhelming to me)"

Perhaps I might try the pills, but a silly question- when I‚Äôm flying to see him (I‚Äôm at college right now) I‚Äôm gonna be changing time zones, which worries me about the pill‚Äôs accuracy. do I just... try to take the pill 24 hours directly after I last took it, effectively taking it a different time of day since I‚Äôm changing location? Or would I take it the same time of day regardless of time zone?
This probably sounds really dumb but I wanna make sure, I‚Äôm sorry."

I'm not sure about pain tolerance; it depends, and from my experience, my pain tolerance is pretty high. For me, it's more the psychological aspect of getting the IUD. I have sexual trauma, so it's been a big step for me to finally be ready/excited for things in/near my vagina lmao. I think I'm ready for a dick, but uhhh... an IUD? I dunno how I'll react, so that's the scary part.
I'll be walking home- the center is literally down the street from where I'm living, thankfully."
