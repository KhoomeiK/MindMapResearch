There are a lot of reasons why potatoes make better valentines day gifts than roses. Roses only last like a couple weeks, and that's if you leave them in water.  They really only exist to be pretty which is like saying ""my love for you is transitory and based solely on your appearance."" But potatoes last for fucking ever. In fact, not only will they not rot, they actually grow shit even if you just leave them in the sack. That part alone makes it a good symbol, but there's more! There are so many ways to enjoy a potato: fried, baked, roasted, and even mashed! You can even make a battery with it!  And that's like saying ""I have many ways in which I show my love for you."". Potatoes may not be as pretty as roses, but they're still awesome. Which says ""it doesn't matter at all what you look like, I'll still love you"""
