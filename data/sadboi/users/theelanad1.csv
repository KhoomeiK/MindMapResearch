Though I worry there's nothing I can report to Instagram/anywhere legal if it comes to it because the artwork is not identifying. Anything I found online only mentioned pieces or pictures that are identifying."

However, a year and a half ago I was put on the same dosages for an emergency so idk if he could see the old dosages and just put them as that? But also I specifically told him that the previous dosage wasn't working for me/was too much and I think he only lowered the Lexapro."

relationships,eopisee,t3_bsq6zs,1558765346.0,"OP, I might not have the best advice here. I'm still trying to get over someone myself. And honestly, for you it seems a lot of it is because of the ""maybe future"" she alluded to. I've hung on for too long for similar reasons. Sayings of ""I want to be in a better spot first"" ""I don't know how I'm going to react to other life changes"" and the very occasional reminder that the feeling is still mutual. 


That ""maybe future"" is so hard to let go of when you love someone. But what I can tell you, if they really want to be with you--they will. They'll work it out and work with you, figure out a way, compromise. If they aren't doing that? Do you. Put that same loving energy into yourself, better yourself. Figure out what you really want. Being single, dating around, focusing on work/school? All experience and experience that may help/put things in perspective for yourself, your future, and what you need from a companion.


I wish you so much luck."
relationships,eophxgu,t1_eopbdn4,1558764632.0,"Seconded. Being single is not the end of the world. It gives you a better understanding of yourself, what you want/need, and more likely to strive for something healthier the next go around.

This is all a learning experience. Even the bad ones. You can learn how you actually want to be treated and connect with others accordingly.

Like u/TheBackgroundBoy said, it will happen. You have time. Time to put that caring/worrying energy into yourself.

Best of luck OP"
