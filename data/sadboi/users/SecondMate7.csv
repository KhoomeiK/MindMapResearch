This sucks. Is this what life is like? Just wasting away in a shell waiting for my life to magically brighten up? I can't get out of my own head, I've self harmed before and considered it again, but I just meed something to combat this emotional pain that I feel ever day.

I find music to be a calming transition, or otherwise a surefire way to shed a few tears"

It's costing me everything, concentration at school, social life with friends is nonexistent and I've got no courage to talk to that girl I like. 

I just need a friend"
