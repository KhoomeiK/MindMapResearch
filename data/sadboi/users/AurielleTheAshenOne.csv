BPD,f6y28vk,t1_f6xvxq9,1573265466.0,"oh my god. i'm in the exact same boat. shes my FP and i'm her FP. we're both women and she knows I am in love with her and she loves me too, but isn't ""in love"". She treats me like a girlfriend and tells me I can do the same with her, and that we're ""basically dating"" but she doesn't want to date or make it official as she's afraid of the stress and pressure of putting the official label on it. we're also both bi, but she has a male preference so.... yeah.. if she ever does choose to date i'm automatically not in her sights it feels like. i truly feel like she keeps me around for my attention and care, but i also can sense true, love and care from her so i don't know what to believe anymore. it kills me, truly."
