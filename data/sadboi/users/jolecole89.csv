The teacher was trying to figure out how to mute some kids and she closed her self out. As soon as she was gone one kid right away said “Hey you guys wanna see my dog?” Then it was show and tell with everyone showing off their pets till the teacher came back. It was great."
WomensHealth,fmlzzlg,t3_fw0o0c,1586196251.0,Around your age I started this too. Sometimes just like that or a full blow period twice a month.
WomensHealth,fm8ny2o,t3_ftqcps,1585852816.0,The more you stress the later it can be. I’ve stress so much about other things in life that it didn’t start for two months. Try to relax not to think about it. A lot of us have been where you are. It’s scary. But in the end you have to do what’s right for you.
toddlers,fm5hhr8,t3_fspmnq,1585773048.0,I enchanted Toothless the Dragon with magical monster killing powers. He has been doing his job for about 6 years now. She will be 9 here soon. Same thing with Marshall. He is still working hard against bad dreams. Sometimes you just have to go with their imagination and add a little more to it. And a night light too.

BipolarReddit,fkybk9w,t3_fle6ca,1584645477.0,I always find that journaling helps me. I use oracle cards that have key words to help me start. I know it’s not for everyone. Sometimes I write a letter to someone too. Maybe my mom who past 8 years ago or a favorite character. Hope you get past this and feel better soon.

She didn’t tell me that, but I know it’s true. My mom was defensive with her therapist in the past. So she would only get 30 min. Point is, there could be lots of reason."
