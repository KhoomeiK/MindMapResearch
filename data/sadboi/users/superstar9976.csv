As long as we gave them a solid heads up (like a few months before anticipating school or clinicals) they were willing to modify schedules to make it work. That's how I was able to secure a PT 10 hour weekends only schedule, I told my manager I would need some accommodations for my clinical rotations one year before they started."
medlabprofessionals,fp70pxy,t3_gbofy8,1588361940.0,"I did the same thing you are planning to do. Finished BS Biology, then did MLS postbac while working as a lab assistant. You'll learn everything you need to learn on the job, so don't worry too much about prep. Managers are looking more so for soft skills that they can't build, like disposition to teamwork, good personality, multitasking ability, able to learn quickly etc so try to be able to relate some experiences that show that you are a good worker.

To score that first lab assist job though, be super flexible about your scheduling. I had a hard time getting calls back until I started applying for the worse shifts. I landed a lab assist job that was full time 4PM-12AM, which was pretty bad, but at least I had the job. Once you're in, you can ask for schedule modifications (ended up switching to 2P-1030P, then finally getting approval to drop to PT weekends doing 10 hour shifts).

Try to find a position within a big hospital chain, they are usually easier to get jobs in and have decent benefits. My hospital chain gives us about 5k a year in school reimbursements, so basically I had them pay for a massive chunk of my school.  Look into that as well. There is the added benefit of that hospital chain having MLS positions as well. I have an MLS job offer pending my graduation this month (and corona dying down...lol) in the same hospital system that I work in. That means my PTO , tuition reimbursements, seniority ,etc all roll over without any issue."
