AskReddit,fh3ly68,t3_f18upu,1581270218.0,"my failure rate so far. 

I've been trying to kill myself since I was 8 years old, mostly by swallowing bottles of various pills and laying down in bed with a note under my pillow. Once when I was 15, I tried combining it with too shallow cuts on my arms in the bathtub. Every single time, I've woken up, disappointed that I'm such a failure I can't even kill myself correctly. All I've managed is destroying my stomach lining and making myself allergic to Motrin and Tylenol and sleeping pills. I've lost count of how many attempts.

 I'm too much of a coward to jump on train tracks or off a building, but whenever I'm near either, it crosses my mind and I want to. But I realize that with my track record, I'd probably just end up becoming a vegetable who wants to die even more without the means to do it or even the ability to wipe my own ass. 

Now I spend my spare time researching methods with the lowest failure rates and bide my time until I can find the right opportunity.  I hope I find it soon. I'm tired of being here."
