So, I was on my way home when I see a man begging for money. He wasn't even asking for much I think I heard him ask for 1 euro and I walked by him because I was late but this is not about me. So I suddenly hear this other dude ask why he needs the money and the man told him he wanted to buy himself ice cream because he missed it. At this point I'm worried and stop and I can hear my train arrive but I didn't really care. The guy informs him ice cream is more expensive than that and the man looks like he's gonna cry but then the guy gently puts 10 Euro into his hands. They left and I hurried up to the platform, I missed it of course, but as I was waiting for the next one I saw them walking together, eating ice cream and laughing."
Anxiety,fpqznkf,t3_geiyn7,1588837279.0,Same teachers used to ask me to do some prep to present my homework for the others and I drove myself crazy trying to perfect it but in the end I wrote them an email and didn't come in on those days saying I got sick because I was just so afraid I would make a mistake  and now I just straight up refuse everything because I'm scared I won't do a passable job at it
