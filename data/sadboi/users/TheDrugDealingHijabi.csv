Did she work, did she have her own place? Considering youve not mentioned any other red flags, she likely had an established life. Not having friends or other family doesn't mean she's a ghost. She may just have trust issues and who doesn't when they have abusive parent(s) It's understandable she left with you violating her trust and not even telling her before meeting her. Really, OP what were you thinking? Not all parents are loving people. Some are manipulative, narcissistic and psychopath. You're lucky the guy wasn't abusive with you.
