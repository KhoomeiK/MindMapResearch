mentalhealth,fr1smgl,t3_gm5c8i,1589825235.0,"It's okay to not know what you need.  You will probably figure it out over time as your friendship continues. So try and take that pressure off of yourself. 

For now you can tell her that you really aren't sure if there is anything she can do to help.  But if you are finding that by her listening to you, and being patient with you, is helpful, tell her what she is doing right now is already very helpful to you.

As a side suggestion, which you might already be doing, but just in case, try to also listen to her 'stuff'.  That way the friendship doesn't become one sided, where one person is always discussing their problems, but it becomes a two way friendship, that you can lean on each other.  Even if she doesn't have 'problems' per say, be willing to listen to how her day went, what she did that day, or anything, even if it is simple and just chitter chatter.  Sometimes being there for someone else, even if we have issues that are bothering us, can be a distraction, so focusing on her stuff as well as your own, can help balance out the friendship, and give you something else to think about, besides your issues.  Hope that makes sense, lol.

Even if she always seems willing to jump into how you are that day, and what happened with you, take time to ask her about how she is doing, and what happened during her day.  And if a time comes you think of something she could help you with, then let her know, and same for her, if you can help her someway, then you can also be there for her.  :)"

CasualConversation,fqua5h5,t1_fqu7vlt,1589654999.0,"Oh I guess I should clarify. We of course are following all the advice to stay safe.  Not going out, social distancing during essential trips to the grocery store and limiting how much one is going to the grocery store.  Not going any where else, staying at home. Washing hands. No contact with anyone outside our home. (Wife and I are obviously isolating together).  I was referring to the fact we aren't in a position to help supply/donate the workers with PPE, we don't have extra money to send them food or make donations, and that kind of thing.  (being disabled and on limited income).  It's to join in the rest of the neighbourhood to show support. (The neighbourhood is making noise at 7 whether we join in or not).  So participating in the nation wide 7 PM cheer is really the only thing we can outwardly do to show support.  No videos are being made or anything. We're not doing it to 'look good' or anything like that, because that's not the point.  I was a health care worker before I became disabled, so I guess I feel a connection and want to show my appreciation for what the workers are going through.   Thank you for your input! :)"

mentalhealth,fqnqxv0,t3_gjw95t,1589499755.0,"Sorry you are having a rough time right now. I have seen several people post similar concerns as you have, losing their motivation to do their schoolwork or work, or chores, or something similar, for various reasons. So you're not alone in struggling. I don't know if this will help, but this is something I have shared to a few people who are also having a lot trouble getting their 'work' done----

One thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the work/cleaning/yard work/etc you need to do.

When it comes time to do the work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, fifteen minutes the first day. During that fifteen minutes, for example, get your work/chores organized and figure out what you exactly want to accomplish. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your work. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes or so (whatever time frame seems reasonable to you to add).  Then when comfortable with that amount, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to your work/chores.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So ""trick"" your brain by doing fifteen minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first couple of days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can dust for fifteen minutes and organize their chores"". ""I can do that, I can vacuum for fifteen minutes, that's easy"". ""I can easily pull weeds out of the garden for fifteen minutes"".  Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up). But start saying to yourself ""I can do this chore/yard work"", ""I can do fifteen minutes of dishes, it is easy to do fifteen minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully. It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your chores/work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of doing the cleaning, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only washing some dishes in the sink, or dusting some trinkets). If you stick to it, and keep doing 15, 20, or even 30 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do fifteen minutes of chores today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task.  You can even do something like put on some favourite music/songs while doing your chores and sing along, and it might help the time go by faster.  Good luck!"
mentalhealth,fqnax6o,t3_gjulgk,1589491643.0,"Hi Op, sorry to hear you are having such a rough time right now.  I can relate to your situation, in that I worked as psychiatric nurse for over 20 + years, and also have my own mental illness.  It can be tricky to be on both sides.  

Since you mentioned you were on medication, how would you feel talking to whom ever is prescribing your meds about the change in your mental state?  Perhaps an increase in your dose/or addition of a new med would be of some benefit.  

Do you have some type of Employee Assistance Program at your work, that you could find a counsellor to talk to?  It sounds like you could use some extra support right now.  

I understand why you might not feel like you can get that from family members.  Unfortunately some people seem to have a hard time wrapping their brain around the fact that someone in mental health could also have their own illness.  Not everybody of course,  just some times.  

Perhaps there is some counselling available in your area that you could look into?  I understand you don't want to confide in a coworker, but is there someone at work in a different department that might have knowledge of resources that you could have access to?  Maybe someone there could help you find a therapist or something.

In the meantime, find some things that work for you, to take care of yourself.  It's okay you are having a rough time, it's nothing to feel embarrassed or bad about.  It's okay to reach out for help.  Those of us that work in mental health are human, too, and can have our own illnesses to battle.

Even though you aren't 'feeling' like you are enjoying things right now, it can still help to some degree to go through the motions, so that you don't resign yourself to bed.  I know it feels so very hard, but sometimes doing things, even if you aren't getting as much pleasure as usual, can help distract you, keep your mind busy, and focus off of your thoughts/feelings, and can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, even if you can only do one thing a day.  Sometimes just doing silly, busy things can distract from the dperession.

Like keeping a routine.  A routine can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, time for work, etc.  I know you said you took one mental health day, but is there an opportunity for you to take a few days in a row, to give yourself a break from work?

Do you use relaxation techniques?  I have some I like that I can copy for you here to have a look at trying-----

 **Relaxation techniques**\----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400)
3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

I also have  list of things to do to distract (or self sooth) that I'll copy for here, too.  You can come up with your own list, but maybe this will help you get started----

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

AmItheAsshole,fqk58dy,t3_gj5dib,1589420394.0,"I saw your post earlier but didn't have a chance to comment, and now I see all your edits, so no need now to make a verdict.  What I did really want to say though was about your husbands relationships to his daughter and soon to be daughters.  Of course they will each have their unique personalities and likes, but that doesn't mean he can't put in effort to explore their likes and dislikes, and expand beyond playing princess. (which he could still play with them too).

As an only child myself (daughter, although now 55, and my parents are over 80), my Dad always made an effort for us to do things together.  We went fishing.  I had my own kids size fishing pole.  Which apparently Dad liked too (maybe it was lucky, I don't know, lol), so he would ask to borrow it, and I would apparently charge him 10 cents to use it, lol.  

He was the one that introduced me to hockey.  Every time Saturday ""Hockey Night in Canada"" came on, we would head down to the basement where the second tv was, with our bag of peanuts, and watch hockey together.  He taught me everything about the game.  If our home team wasn't playing, we would each pick a team to cheer for, to have some friendly rivalry.  We still talk about our teams all these years later. (I am in a different province now, so I have a different home team than he does).

We went swimming together every Sunday morning.  Even through my teens, when I was on the swim team and water polo team, practising twice a day throughout the week.  I would still go every Sunday with him for our Dad and daughter time. 

He taught me how to play some card games.  Crib became a fun activity for the two of us to do.  We would play board games together.  We used to leg wrestle in the living room.  He was a construction worker.  When he did home improvements, I was there helping him lay bricks, and mix the 'mud'.  He taught me how to drive.  Automatic and Standard.  He taught me how to change a tire.  So many things to even list here.

The point is, it doesn't matter what the activity is, but your husband has the chance to make time with his girls, to introduce new activities for them to try together.  They might like some, might not like some others.  Or one daughter might be the fisher woman, and one might be the sports girl.  Who knows.  But he can try, and not just assume they will only be interested in princesses.  He has the opportunity to make time with his girls interesting and exploring of all range of activities.  Let them figure out together what they enjoy, and keep trying new things, and spend quality time together.  Congrats on your triplets!"
mentalhealth,fqidybv,t3_gj3a2n,1589394716.0,"Sorry to hear you are having such a rough time right now.  It's really good that you are willing to reach out for help and want to make some changes.  I know it can be scary to think of going to a hospital, hearing some people's stories of it not being helpful and/or a bad experience.  Keep in mind, sometimes the people posting their bad experiences didn't want to go the hospital in the first place.  Not discounting their experiences and what happened while they were there, but pointing out that their perspective on a it could be on the negative side, because they didn't want help, or were 'committed', and have a negative feeling about it all because they didn't want to be there.  How people can view their experience can be significantly effected by whether they wanted to be there for help, or not.  Hope that makes sense.  Again, not discounting their feelings, but they may view the experience as negative overall, because they didn't want to be there.

Since you are at a point of wanting help, and wanting to make changes so that you can deal with your suicidal thoughts/feelings, you would probably be going into hospital with more of an open mind and a feeling of wanting to learn how to cope.  Going into something like that with a more open and positive mind set can really help you.

You mentioned receiving outpatient help and medications.  Can you ask any of those people where a suitable place for you to go might be?  Who is prescribing your meds for you, a GP, or a psychiatrist?  They may have some good suggestions for you, too.  You mentioned going to doctors, but not getting help.  Is that because it wasn't their field of expertise?  Like a GP may not have the extensive background a psych doc would have.  If they themselves don't feel like they could adequately treat you, could they not make a referral?

Some things to also think about is are you willing to fully participate in treatment if you do find a hospital to go to?  For example, you mentioned you rely on electronics.  When I worked in psych (a nurse, not a doctor), cell phones were coming into mainstream, but not as much as they are now.  But back then, patients weren't allowed their phones for a few different reasons.  Liability (if someone damages, or another patient damages someones phone, the hospital doesn't want to be liable).  Also privacy.  With cell phones being capable of taking pictures, you can't trust that no one will  take a picture that might have another patient in the picture (even if on accident, like someone was in the background), for patient confidentiality reasons.  Also if everyone had their phones, they would never participate in other activities or groups or what ever.  So, although I don't know exactly how it is being dealt with currently, there is a chance you may have limited access to your devices.  Also, if you are wanting to learn new coping strategies, you might have to learn how to do it without a device 24/7.  Devices have their place, but in a hospital, probably not all day, as they would want you to participate in activities and groups and the like.

In the meantime, until you can find an appropriate place to go, maybe it would be helpful to use relaxation techniques, and distraction to help with the suicidal thoughts.  Also there is a technique called the **S T O P technique** that can be helpful to some people. It might help you with the negative/intrusive thoughts-----

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand.

It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

**Relaxation techniques**\----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there.

3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

Have a great day.  You can do it!  :)"
mentalhealth,fqav261,t3_ghtcw2,1589225780.0,"These are some suggestions I have made to others that are having a hard time right now with the isolation---

 Consider limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. Even if that means asking people to not speak about it when you are talking to others. Tell them you caught up with today's newest information, and no longer wish to discuss it for the day. 

A routine is helpful, especially right now during this difficult time (It can help decrease stress, keep you focused on tasks you need to do, to be more organized and help you get everything fit into your day effectively, helps you keep balance, scheduling things so you aren't overloaded one day, then under scheduled the next day)! So if you don't currently have a routine, it would be a good idea to make one. Since you mentioned being back at school now, part of your day is probably routined while at school, but you could always make an outside of school routine schedule for yourself.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

Sometimes using **Distraction (Self soothing) techniques** can be useful too.. I will copy a list of activities I use to distract, and maybe some there will be some things you can try (revised list related to isolation right now).----

mentalhealth,fqaqk2j,t3_ghpmrq,1589223557.0,"Sorry to hear you are having such a rough time right now.  As you can see from your experience with negative thoughts, once they start increasing, and you keep thinking of them, the worse and worse one can start feeling.  As a counter to that, it can sometimes help to counter those negatives with positives.  That's not the same as saying ""oh, just think positive'. 

What it really means is working very hard, and finding techniques to counter those negative thoughts each time they come into your head.  Just the same as the more negative thoughts one gets, the more negative we feel, it can work the opposite way, that the more positive thoughts you counter with, the more the positive feelings can start to take over.  It is by no means easy to do.

There is a technique called the S T O P technique that can be helpful to some people.  It might help you with the negative/intrusive thoughts-----

Using positive affirmations can be helpful to some people too.  Here's one article you can read about it, but there are many out there, you can Google Positive Affirmations to read more about it if you want.

I know it can be very hard to do these things, especially when your motivation has dipped out and you just don't want to even get out of bed.  But you have to make an effort, no one can do it for you.  For example, a routine can be very helpful.  (It can help decrease stress, keep you focused on tasks you need to do, to be more organized and help you get everything fit into your day effectively, helps you keep balance, scheduling things so you aren't overloaded one day, then under scheduled the next day)! So if you don't currently have a routine, it would be a good idea to make one. Even if you start very small, and just start by getting out of bed the same time each day, and set certain times for meals.  Then gradually increase it to include time for hygiene, time for fun activities, time to socialize (social distancing, text/email/facetime, etc), time for exercise, time for chores, time for work, etc.  Start small though at first. It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up.

Hope you are feeling better soon.  And congrats on your upcoming wedding."
AskPsychiatry,fq894z2,t3_ghbuj9,1589161019.0,"Congrats on the job! I'm not a doctor, but was a psych nurse and worked in a Forensic Hospital. for 20+ years (now disabled/retired, and been out of the loop a few years, lol)  But I hope you don't mind me throwing in my two cents of something I always remember from back when I was a student psych nurse (wayyyyyy back in 1988-90).  

One of my teachers told us that if a patient walks up to talk to you, and stands too close (in your personal space), even if it's an innocent 'just not aware and happen to be too close' kind of thing, (different than a patient being aggressive) always ask them to take two or three steps backwards.   So just politely say something like ""hi 'Jane', I would appreciate it if you could please take two steps backwards, as you are standing a bit too close, & in my personal space, thank you"".  Otherwise if you are the one to move back, it can come across as you being afraid of the patient, and you don't want patients to think you are scared of them. (May take some conscious thinking about, because it can be almost like a reflex to want to step back yourself if someone suddenly comes up too close and starts talking to you).

I guess one other bit of advice is to remember that the patients there are regular people, who may be going through an illness and having a rough time right now. Just like patients who have physical issues and are in a regular hospital for care, these patients just happen to have and/or are being assessed for a mental illness.  Treat them the same as you would other people, with the same respect and dignity as you would wish to be treated if it were you having the hard time.

Hope your job goes well, you enjoy the work, and learn a lot.  Take care of yourself while you are taking care of others.  :)"
mentalhealth,fpxdyv8,t3_gg2n4r,1588980814.0,"As hard as it is right now, and even though we don't know exactly when it will end, keep reminding yourself this is not forever.  This is just temporary, and the restrictions put in place are to help save lives.  Our discomfort and frustrations are valid and important, but peoples lives are at stake, and these are the measures we must go through, temporarily.

As much as you are feeling interested in it all, although becoming obsessed and feeling it is damaging, I know it might feel really hard to limit yourself, but it sounds like you really need to make that effort.  If it helps, set an alarm for a reasonable amount of time to listen/read the news, like 15-30 minutes, then when the timer goes off, stop what you are doing and turn it off, no matter what.  You are the only one that can control the amount of time you spend on it, so you have to be the one to find the strength to turn it off, if it is becoming 'damaging'.

Then it might be beneficial to find some things to distract yourself with, so that you can change what you are focusing on, and get your mind off of the news.

You can consider her/him as not having a personal opinion or being judgemental, because she/he doesn't bring personal feelings into a patient-therapist relationship. Not saying they don't care about you, just that they care about you in a professional way, and are there to do their job, and try and guide you through ways to cope with your mental health issues.

 Perhaps using **Relaxation techniques** can be helpful to you, too----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400)
3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

Making and following a routine.  It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day.  It can help keep you busy and your mind distracted. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc.

mentalhealth,fpmhy9o,t3_ge9jjr,1588733470.0,"Here are some general tips I have been sharing to possibly help with the isolation due to the virus, so I will copy it here for you to have a read-----

A routine is helpful, especially right now during this difficult time (It can help decrease stress, keep you focused on tasks you need to do, to be more organized and help you get everything fit into your day effectively, helps you keep balance, scheduling things so you aren't overloaded one day, then under scheduled the next day)! So if you don't currently have a routine, it would be a good idea to make one.

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time, if you have people. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

AmItheAsshole,fplp9sw,t3_ge1jpq,1588716883.0,"NTA.  You have to do what is comfortable for you and your family.  Some thing popped into my mind when I read the part about her wanting a relationship with you and to be an Aunt to your kids.  As a recovering alcoholic myself, and being familiar with the 12 Steps, I would have imagined a scenario where she mentioned working on the steps, and was hoping for an an opportunity to make amends to you, as her first priority of the 'wanting a relationship with"" you comment.  Not 'wanting', but 'hoping' to speak with you, ***if*** you were open to that.  Steps 8 & 9 are----

8.  Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to   
them all.

9.  Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, ***except when to do so***   
***would injure them or others.***

The important part being ""***except when to do so would injure them or others.""***  It's okay to 'ask' if someone is willing to sit down with you (even if it means a family or friend does the initial asking if you will meet with them, so they aren't contacting you directly without your permission), so that you can make amends, but you must honour their wishes, if they say no, then it's a no.  So it seems weird to me that she just jumped right into wanting a relationship with you, without even talking about amends.  (I do realize not everyone uses AA for recovery, but since she put you and your family through so much turmoil, you'd think she would have some kind of idea about apologizing/making amends, even if not following that program).  

Do what's best for you, OP.  Good luck."
mentalhealth,fpk7djv,t3_gdyjfe,1588689414.0," Sorry you are having a rough time right now. I have seen several people post similar concerns as you have, losing their motivation to do their schoolwork (or work, or something similar) for various reasons. So you're not alone in struggling. I don't know if this will help, but this is something I have shared to a few people who are also having a lot trouble getting their work done----

In regards to your schoolwork, one thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task."
mentalhealth,fpir35i,t3_gdoe2p,1588646830.0,"I think it would show your family, friends, and Therapist/Doctor that you *are* making progress by coming clean, if that's something you don't normally do.  You could tell them that you stopped taking your meds, but you realize now that it was a mistake to do that (if that's actually how you feel) and that you are going to make more of an effort to consistently take them, and are going to renew your effort into not hurting yourself (if that's what you want to actually do).  If you are having a hard time remembering your meds, try what another commenter suggested and set an alarm.  Or another approach is to set out a visual reminder for yourself to take them.  For example, if you eat cereal in the morning, put your pill bottle in the cereal bowl the night before, so you see it when you eat your breakfast.  Or if you drink coffee, put the pills by your coffee cup.  Something like that, so that you see them, and then can remember to take them.

Although I know it doesn't feel this way, but harming yourself is something within your control.  Even if there are many stressful things going on in your environment, you can make the choice to hurt yourself, or not hurt yourself.  If you want to try to not hurt yourself, sometimes having things to do to distract yourself with can be helpful.  Make a list of things you like to do that can take your mind off of self harm.  If it helps, tell yourself you won't self harm for one hour.  Do some activity, or talk to a friend, or anything you can think of, and when that hour is up, make a new choice to wait one more hour.  Keep postponing it until the urge has passed.  Do some relaxation techniques to help calm and soothe yourself.  Reach out to someone to talk to, even if you don't want to talk about your stressors, talk to them about anything, to help distract yourself.

I can share a list of Distraction ideas with you, until you make a list of your own ideas, and some relaxation techniques I find helpful.-----

Psychiatry,fph80ec,t3_gdfefu,1588616584.0,"As a (now disabled/retired) psych nurse, who has had issues with depression/anxiety throughout the years, it can feel like a tricky situation to be in.  I graduated way back in 1990, and in 2000 I hurt my back and had to take sick leave, and my depression became worse over that time.  

I was seeing a therapist, and at one session admitted how things had become quite bad, and they called my Gp (with my permission) and both suggested I go to the hospital.  I did, and was admitted for what ended up being two weeks.  

Obviously not at my hospital (I worked at a Forensic hospital anyway), but a hospital nearby.  I was afraid of seeing ex patients (which I did, but luckily they were too sick at the time to recognize me).  I saw some staff that previously worked at the same hospital I worked at, so had to deal with the awkwardness of that.  Luckily the couple I ran into were compassionate, and did their best to put me at ease about the situation. 

Some of the nurses that I met during that time seemed to treat me like a regular patient, some didn't, but that's another story, lol.  It was suggested I don't tell any of the patients that I met what I did for a living, partly so they don't come to me with their issues instead of the staff, and partly for privacy reasons, so that felt a little weird, not being able to speak openly about myself, if I was comfortable with another patient.  

There are other stories about this I could tell, but this post is already too long, lol.  It was an interesting journey. 

 In regards though to your comment about----  ""my co-workers and I were harmlessly joking about how things have been so hectic with Covid and we are feeling so wiped out lately that we think we are going to need a bed for ourselves"".....I used to make dark humour jokes about my mental health too, just as a way of coping, it partly being a joke, but also had some real intent behind the jokes. 

So even if on your end it was a joke, perhaps approach your coworkers who were also joking, in a *private* manner, and check in with them to see if it really was joking on their part.  They may have used that opportunity to joke, but also may have some reality behind their joke. 

Just mentioning that because, as I said, I used to make dark humour jokes, too, and one time I was doing that, but ended up being sick with a flu type illness a couple of days later, and the coworker I was joking with went to my supervisor to express concern about my absence and my mental health, and the supervisor phoned me and told me a coworker was concerned I might hurt myself and might have been off sick for mental health issues.  I was a bit weirded out at first that the coworker went to my supervisor, but then realized it came from a place of caring, and was a good reminder to maybe not be as 'jokey' about my own mental health.

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there.

3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

mentalhealth,fpea16o,t3_gcoca4,1588543355.0,"It can be hard to deal with procrastination because whatever techniques you set up for yourself, it still comes down to you having to do the thing  you want/need to do.  So something that can be helpful is ""tricking"" your brain.

For example, set your self up a realistic routine of the things you want to accomplish, along with things you usually like to do. Make it realistic as to not totally overwhelm yourself with so many things in one day that you can't achieve it.  Start small, adding things as you get more used to following a schedule.  Get up the same time of day, eat meals around the same time, schedule in the 'work/chore' type things, alternating with something 'fun', time to exercise, time to socialize (safely during this time of health crisis),  go to bed the same time, etc.  Routines, in general, can be quite helpful, whether you are dealing with procrastination or not, because they can help reduce one's stress, help you balance out your work, keep focus, and help you to not overwhelm yourself one day, and under schedule the next day.

So at first set small amounts of time dedicated to one activity at a time.  Set a timer, and do that activity for a small amount of time to get used to it.  When the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to another activity.  The 'tricking' your brain part comes in here.  For example, if you set your timer for activity  number one, set it for something small like fifteen minutes.  Tell yourself positive messages about that thing, and 'trick' your brain into thinking this is really easy to do.   For example, ""I am going to dust the house for fifteen minutes"", ""that is so easy, anyone can do this for fifteen minutes"".  Then give yourself a small break, get some water to drink or a snack, etc.  The set your timer again for activity number two, for another fifteen minutes (or however long you think is reasonable to achieve).  

Keep in mind it is better for your brain to set small, achievable goals, and then feel positive because you were actually able to achieve that goal.  If you set it too big, your brain gets discouraged, and starts thinking 'this is impossible, I can't do it"", and then you feel defeated.  So keep things short and doable at first, then you can start setting the timer for longer.

So go through your day, achieving small goals, using the timer, telling your brain this is ""so easy"" to do (even if you *feel* it's not, it's important to trick your brain into thinking it is easy).  Then as you practise your routine, and start making small goals and feel good about the achievements, you can start building your schedule up to include more things, or do things for a bit longer every few days.  When you achieve a small goal, give yourself a positive reward for doing it.  That can help reinforce that this activity was worth doing, because you get some treat or reward once it's done.  Good luck!"
mentalhealth,fpdzbg5,t3_gcte7v,1588537245.0," Sorry you are having a rough time right now. I have seen several people post similar concerns as you have, losing their motivation to do their schoolwork (or work, or something similar) for various reasons. So you're not alone in struggling. I don't know if this will help, but this is something I have shared to a few people who are also having a lot trouble getting their work done----

In regards to your schoolwork, one thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task."

mentalhealth,fp4dvk6,t3_gb7yk8,1588296952.0,"Depression can sometimes become a place like a comfort zone, especially if you've been dealing with it for a long time.  It's like when you start to feel happiness again, your brain is going--'oh, what is this?, it feels weird'.  It might help to just acknowledge that those thoughts/feelings of happiness that are starting to come back might feel a bit weird at first, just remind yourself that it is okay, and that you are safe, and happiness is a good feeling, to help your brain adjust to it's 'weirdness' at first.  If that makes sense, lol.

You might have to challenge your thinking and tell yourself it is good/normal to feel happy, and to not be experiencing the anxiety, so you 'don't go down the rabbit hole' again.  Language that we use with our self can matter, too. 

If I could give you a small suggestion.  It's understandable when we are trying to describe something to someone, like in a post here, to want to put a quantitative label on our illnesses.  Like saying ""severe"" when telling us about your illness.  A lot of people do it, they say their depression is 'extreme', or they have 'crippling' anxiety, or 'debilitating' depression/anxiety, and words like that. But if you are thinking about it to yourself, or talking to someone, it might be helpful to your brain to refrain from using words like that.  When we describe something we are trying to resolve as 'extreme', or 'severe', or 'crippling', those words are very strong, and make our brain think it is too much to overcome.  It might be helpful to just state ""I have a depression and anxiety disorder', rather than make your brain think you have such an impossible level of illness, that it can't beat something that is so 'severe' or 'extreme'.  I hope this makes sense.  It's just a little brain trick, to help your brain recognize it can overcome depressive thoughts, instead of making it work even harder by thinking it has to overcome 'severe"" depressive thoughts.  Just thought I'd throw that little hint at you, hope it makes sense to you.

 Hope you are feeling better soon.  Keep up the good fight!  :)"
mentalhealth,fp3yp0w,t3_gb5n1b,1588288298.0,"If you do end up in hospital, you may as well make the most of it.  Be honest.  They can't help what they don't know exists.  So if you want help, the more open and honest you can be, the better the benefit, as they can help when you tell them the truth about what you are going through.  

Sometimes the rules can seem weird or irrelevant to what you are there for, but rules are set in place for the health and safety of the patients and staff.  It's okay to ask questions.  Be respectful to others and treat them in a manner you would wish to be treated.  

Attend the activities you are scheduled for to, again, get the most benefit while you are there.  Even if they don't seem to be your cup of tea (eg: a crafty type group, or something, you may end up liking it, plus it's a distraction from routine).  

Do your best to be cooperative with the staff, and if you don't understand why you are being asked to do something, it's okay to ask questions, just try to be mindful of being respectful to others, no need for arguments. 

 I'm guessing you are having a rough time right now, since you might be hospitalized, and not knowing if you are happy or angry about that, remember it's not the staffs fault you are there, so try not to take any anger you might have on the staff.  Keep in mind the world is having a tough time right now with the health crisis, so try to be patient if wait times are longer, and if people are a bit more stressed.  

Make the most of your time there, focus on what you need to do to feel better, and use the resources they may provide to you.  Good luck, and hope you feel better soon."
mentalhealth,fp3phrl,t3_gb22zz,1588283448.0,"That's great you are at a place that you can acknowledge and want to fix past mistakes.  It reminds me of Steps 8 & 9 in AA ----

8.  ""Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends   
to them all.""

9.  ""Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, *except when to do so*   
*would injure them or others*.""

Taking note of the last part of #9- ""*except when to do so would injure them or others"".*  If you still have contact with the person(s), you could approach them about talking to them to extend your apologies, or if a friend of friend type thing, where someone could ask them if they would be open to talking to you for an apology.  Otherwise if you think it could cause more harm, it would probably be best to work it out on your end, through your journaling and self reflection.  If you can't say the amends in person, maybe writing out what your end of the conversation would be to try and work it out that way.  If the person can be contacted, and they do not want to talk to you, remember to be respectful of their decision to not hear your apology.  Hearing ""no"" might be hard, but if you are truly trying to change things, accept that it might cause them harm, and respect their 'no'.

Sometimes after writing it all out, saying it to a separate third party person (uninvolved with the original issue) might be helpful.  Someone that can not just only hear your words, but have a discussion with you about the past actions, and asking any questions to clarify what you are remorseful about, what you did that was 'wrong', and hearing the apology you would have said to the person.

Also, this is something a friend and I used to do, when trying to deal with things from the past.  For dealing with the memories/thoughts/guilt/shame you are having, maybe this will be useful (copying this from a previous comment of mine so I don't have type it all out again, lol)-----

**Letting go**\--------

I know this will probably seem really silly and dumb, but my friend and I used to do this to help get rid of things that we did that bothered us, or things we needed to let go.

We would write down everything to do with 'the thing' we wanted to get rid of from our minds. So whether it took one page of purging our thoughts/feelings, or ten pages. We just wrote down everything about 'the thing'. (If there was more than one 'thing', we did separate 'ceremonies' for each 'thing'). Just get it all out, everything you want to say about it.

Then when it was all written out, we would read out loud to each other what we wrote, we talked about it as much as was needed, answered any lingering questions, just talked it out until there was nothing left to talk about regarding 'the thing'. (if you don't have someone to read it to, just reading out loud to yourself is fine too).

Then the next step was to find an appropriate can/container to rip up all of our pages we wrote and place them in the can. Then we took the can outside, with a match/lighter, and with a bottle of water (to douse the flame after ward).

Then we set it on fire (in a safe place), said some words about we are now letting this 'thing' go, sending it out into the universe, and we will no longer be troubled/bothered/think about it ever again. Watched the flame glow, and the smoke go up into the air. Then douse the flame after it has burned up.

Like I said, sounds totally silly, but the whole process of purging the thoughts/feelings, writing it all out, talking about it out loud, then ripping it up and burning it, letting it go into the universe, was a quite freeing experience. (It may also have to be done more than once)."
mentalhealth,fp3lcrw,t3_gb370k,1588281334.0," Here are some general tips I have been sharing to possibly help with the isolation due to the virus, so I will copy it here for you to have a read-----

A routine is helpful, especially right now during this difficult time (It can help decrease stress, keep you focused on tasks you need to do, to be more organized and help you get everything fit into your day effectively, helps you keep balance, scheduling things so you aren't overloaded one day, then under scheduled the next day)! So if you don't currently have a routine, it would be a good idea to make one.

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time, if you have people. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

It is absolutely normal to feel grief and anger, and many more emotions, too.  Even if it was a mutual decision, it can still be upsetting that things didn't work out.  So if you notice you are having a variety of emotions, remind yourself it is normal and okay to go through.  It can take some time to process it all, even if you know it was the best decision.  I realize it might be a little harder than usual right now, because of the isolation aspect of the current health crisis, and limit to what you can go out and do.

Perhaps just try to get reconnected to yourself again.  Remind yourself what your likes and dislikes are, what are things you used to enjoy, that perhaps you didn't do anymore once you were in a relationship, because your focused changed, like you said, it was 'we', not ""I"".  So figure out the ""I"" part again.  Get back into some old hobbies, or games, or crafts, or things you might have done in the past.  Even though there is social distancing right now, perhaps call/text/email some friends to reconnect with older friends, and keep your connections going with current friends. 

Be gentle with yourself and pamper yourself.  Let yourself feel whatever feelings need to come out.  It's okay to let things out.  Get a new routine going for yourself if your old routine was tied into your partners routine.  A routine can be quite helpful overall, it can help reduce stress, help you stay focused on tasks you want/need to accomplish, can help you keep balanced, so you aren't over scheduling yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day.  So try to get up the same time each day, eat meals at regular times, schedule in some fun things to do, time to exercise (even if it's just putting some music on at home and moving your body), time to relax, time to socialize, go to bed at the same time each night, etc. Do whatever you feel you need to do for yourself.  there is no right way or wrong way, do what you feel will help you.

Some people find holding ice in their hand or putting it on their arm helpful, but if she's in the shower, a piece of ice won't last long, lol.  Would she trust you to sit in the bathroom with her while she's showering (no peeking), so you two could talk or sing or  tell jokes or something while she was showering, to distract her?  At least temporarily until she feels she has better control over it.  I realize you can't 'forever' go into the bathroom with her, but maybe if she is having a hard day, or feeling susceptible, just temporarily?  Not that it's up to you to stop her, just perhaps provide the distraction that she might find helpful.  I hope you and her find something that helps, good luck.  :)

Edit to add--- Another thought just popped into my head about the shower situation.  If she is in an ""I want to try to not self harm frame of mind"", you could offer to hold onto her cutting instruments while she is in the shower, so she has nothing in there to harm with.  Has to be her choice, of course, but if she is 'trying' not to, she may be willing to hand them over during her danger time, especially if she will agree to that, as long as you give them back when she is done her shower.  If she reallllly wants to try, maybe you can keep them for her regularly, unless she asks for them back.  Just a thought.  :)"

mentalhealth,foxng0q,t3_g9ynfz,1588149658.0," Sorry you are having a rough time right now. I have seen several people post similar concerns as you have, losing their motivation to do their schoolwork (or work, or something similar) for various reasons. So you're not alone in struggling. I don't know if this will help, but this is something I have shared to a few people who are also having a lot trouble getting their work done----

In regards to your schoolwork, one thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task."

I know you said you can't afford therapy, but is there perhaps a doctor or someone in a professional capacity that wouldn't cost a lot of money that you could get her to see?  It might be quite beneficial to have some professional help with this.

In the meantime, it might be helpful if you did some reading about the topic, so that you can get a bit better understanding of the issue.  I'll put a link to an article here for you to have a read of it includes some tips to help deal with it)------  [https://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/cutting-and-self-harm.htm](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/cutting-and-self-harm.htm) 

I know it would be difficult, since you mentioned she doesn't want to talk about it.  I also realize that with the health crisis going on right now, you can't go out and about as much, but depending on where you live, and the current restrictions on where you can go, perhaps she would be more willing to discuss it with you if you two could go to an area outside of the house, so there is more privacy, away from your parents.  Like maybe at a park or something.  Maybe she would be a bit more open if she knew it really was between you and her, with no chance of your parents over hearing your conversation.

As you will read in the article, there could be many many reasons why she is harming herself.  I think one thing to keep in mind, is that for ***Some*** people, it can be partly due to an issue with control.  If she is feeling like she doesn't have much control over things in her life right now, she *Can* have control over whether she harms or not.  So perhaps keep in mind while talking to her, to phrase things in a way that she has control.  For example, don't say ""you have to stop this"".  That would be a statement taking control away from her.  It would be better phrased something like this-- ""I can understand you are having a hard time right now, and feel that it helps to hurt yourself.  I am concerned about you, and am wondering if there is something I could do to help you feel better, and find a way for you to possibly choose a healthier way to cope"".  What kind of things would you choose to do to help feel better""?.  I know that is wordy, but you get the idea.  Help her to come to her own conclusions about healthier coping skills, instead of ""telling"" her what to do.

You could even share this article, so she can read more about it, too.  The more she knows about it, might help her to make other choices.  For some people, it can be helpful to kind of trick their minds a bit, to postpone hurting themselves, and using distraction techniques.  For example, ""I will wait for one hour before I hurt myself.""  Then they do an activity or two during that hour, then recommit to another hour of not harming.  Keep pushing it back one hour (or what ever time frame feels doable to her, even if it's just fifteen minutes at a time), then keep pushing it back, until the feeling passes. I'll copy a list of ideas to use for distraction (it's revised right now to take the virus into account, as people can't go out as much as normal)-----

mentalhealth,fov6t3z,t3_g9jeq6,1588096317.0,"You're not a hypocrite.  You are someone who is going through the same thing as the person you are talking with, so you can deeply empathize with what they are going through.  Maybe you need to take a small break from helping others, to give yourself some self care.  

All those things you said to the person you helped, say them to yourself.  I don't mean this next bit to sound harsh, but maybe if you can remember and remind yourself in your most difficult times, that self harm still comes down to you making a choice.  You mentioned talking yourself down eight times, and that's great, but the ninth time you made the choice to self harm.  Not at all giving you heat for the choice, I am a former self harmer, too, so I know the struggle. 

For myself, I had to remind myself I Was in control, it is my choice.  For some people, self harming can come from not feeling in control of anything.  So I had to remind myself that I *could* control whether I self harmed or not. Do I harm, or do I try yet again, another distraction technique, or another relaxation exercise, or whatever type of self care I needed at the time.  It's not easy though.

No matter what the stressors are in our environment, you have control over yourself and have a choice.  It's okay if you choose to harm, like I said, not giving you heat for it.  Just thought maybe what I tried for myself might help you, too,  To remember it is a choice, and I can move forward and make other choices, even though it *feels* very very hard, and at the time, doesn't '*feel'* like a choice, but it technically is.  I hope that makes sense, like I said, not trying to be harsh or anything, just trying to share what helped me.

mentalhealth,forkryt,t3_g8uf13,1588013891.0," Here are some general tips I have been sharing to possibly help with the isolation due to the virus, so I will copy it here for you to have a read-----

A routine is helpful, especially right now during this difficult time (It can help decrease stress, keep you focused on tasks you need to do, to be more organized and help you get everything fit into your day effectively, helps you keep balance, scheduling things so you aren't overloaded one day, then under scheduled the next day)! So if you don't currently have a routine, it would be a good idea to make one.

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time, if you have people. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

mentalhealth,fop3u06,t3_g8nssj,1587952473.0,"This probably won't be very helpful to you, as I did volunteer on a crisis/information line, but it was way back in the 1980's (probably around 85-88).  So obviously things are a lot different now, so I can't really advise you well as far as the technicalities work.  

When I volunteered, (it was in Canada), and it was a phone line plus a place you could call for information on resources.  We had training, but I don't remember how long it was.  I do recall we did role playing (caller and taking the call, sitting back to back, pretending to be on the phone, and go through scenarios of what could happen).  

You also learn about active listening, reflecting feelings, paraphrasing, and those kind of techniques.  I saw you mention you would be training remotely, so I don't know how that all works, since mine was so long ago, and this was before cell phones, etc, so we had a site to go to, to literally man the phone lines, in a room together, on separate phones and desks. (No texting back then).

But at least there were usually two of us at one time, which was good, because if you ran into trouble, or needed help, someone else was nearby, even if it was another volunteer.  I would usually volunteer for overnight shifts, so it was nice to not be alone at 3 am or whatever, lol.

So even though I can't be helpful about the technicalities of it all, I did want to say that for me, it was like the final push I needed to decide on a career, and I went into Psychiatric Nursing.  So I think that in part, it helped me finalize exactly what I wanted to do in mental health, and I went to psych nursing school, graduated in 1990, and spent my career in a Forensic Hospital, working with remand/assessment patients, and those sent back from court for treatment.  It was something I am so glad I did.

So whatever your decision, I hope you have a good experience if you do it, and hope it helps narrow down what you might do in the future.  Oh, by the way, I have had depression and anxiety issues throughout the years, so it can be done, working in psych, and having psych issues yourself.  Good luck!"
mentalhealth,fook5a6,t3_g8l8zq,1587940570.0,"I'm sorry that you are having such a rough time right now, that you are thinking of hurting yourself.  I was wondering if you also had a doctor and/or therapist that you also speak to regularly?  I know this is a trying time right now with the health crisis, and it may be harder to get in touch with one's therapist, but maybe you should consider giving them a call.  If you are on meds, maybe a slight adjustment is needed right now. 

As far as your friends go though, you mentioned you have been talking to them for six years about this.  It sounds like your friends really care about you and want you to be safe.  You mentioned your girlfriend talked you out of hurting yourself last night.  If you are feeling that unsafe, maybe you even need to check in with a hospital, and see if you need to be admitted to stabalize.  As good of a support that friends can be during your rough times of feeling suicidal, professional help might be needed too.  

You expressed that you feel like your friends don't care much and are blowing you off.  But when you say that you have been discussing this with them for six years, I get a different perspective.  That they care for you deeply.  They've been with you through this for six years.  It can be so easy to start to take the support and friendship one has with others for granted, especially if they are a good support for you, and it can become very overwhelming and draining on the other person, no matter how much you care for that person.

I had a situation like this with a former friend (it wasn't suicide related, but they had several different problems).  What started out as a mutual give and take friendship, over time it became all about the other person.  A 'quick' call was at least two hours, a long one several hours.(I worked full time, they weren't working)  It became more and more and more, where our record time on the phone at one time was 16 hours.(It was on my days off).  It became expected.  They never asked if it was a good time to chat, they just started talking.  If anything, at the end of the call, as we were saying good byes, they might remember to ask how I was, and of course by then, I just wanted to get off the phone, so I would say 'fine', and that was it.  It went on and on, the same problems, every day, day in and day out.  I listened and listened, and empathized, and tried my best to be there for them.  If asked, I gave suggestions, but one can only come up with so many new ideas for someone else to try, and most time, they said it wouldn't work, so it was pointless in the end to even suggest anything because they wouldn't even try.  Or would do the ""Yes, but..."" thing.  You know, where you suggest something, and they respond with 'yes, but that won't work because of A B or C.  It became endless frustration, and endless listening to the same thing everyday.  It sucked the life out of me.  I was burnt out. (I should mention I had my own depression and anxiety issues, too).  I won't go on anymore, but you get the idea.

Now I am NOT saying this is how it is with your friends.  Just trying to point out the other side, that as much as you can care about someone, it can sometimes just get to be too much, too overwhelming, too draining.  They have been there with you for six years, they obviously care a lot about you.  Maybe they need a bit of slack, given they could feel a bit burnt out.  Call your therapist if you have one.  Call a crisis line.  Talk to other people besides these two friends, or family.  Keep reaching out, it's great you are talking about your issues and reaching out when feeling suicidal, but if your friends aren't responding the way you want them too, maybe they just don't know what else to tell you (even if they are just listening, it can be human nature to want to help, and make suggestions for the person having trouble, even if you don't ask for any).  If you are still feeling actively suicidal, go to the hospital.  It's okay to go for help.  I hope you are feeling better soon, and that things settle down with your friends.  Good luck!"

But I've made even more of an effort during this health crisis to be polite and thankful when dealing with any essential workers, and thanking them for being there for us during this difficult time.  So, for example, the security guard that is now at our local grocery store, letting people in when someone comes out, thanking them for keeping us safe, the pharmacy workers, the cashiers, the baggers, etc.  Making sure I thank them for being there for us all.  It's kind of sad that it takes them off guard, and they are like oh, um, sure, my pleasure, or your welcome.  They seem surprised someone would be nice to them and give them a big smile and saying thanks for being there.  I think we all could use a little bit of extra thanks and niceness through this rough time.  Thanks for sharing your experience!  :)"

AskPsychiatry,foibmhh,t1_fofgkph,1587782914.0,"NAD, but a psych nurse (female; graduated 1990; now disabled/retired, been out of the loop a few years).  You reminded me of when I was in nursing school (so somewhere between 1988-90, and I don't recall specific details) but on one of our rotations there was a catatonic patient (bedridden, uncommunicative, totally dependant).   So we would have met her one week, she was having ect treatments back then (I'm pretty sure I remember we were able to observe one of her treatments), and I can't recall exactly how long it was when we went there again (maybe two weeks later?; could it have only been one week later??), and she was up, eating by herself, dressing, doing her hygiene, communicating verbally.  It was quite fascinating seeing the change as a student psych nurse.

On a lighter note, although this is a serious topic, but you gave me a bit of a chuckle when you said  ""  i quickly left the room. "" .  I spent my career in Forensics (Maximum Security Remand/Assessment; Treatment/NCRMD;  on both male and female wards), and you reminded me of a couple of specific doctors who would want to have us psych nurses stand in front of them (like two nurses almost shoulder to shoulder, the doc just behind them in the middle, so the patient could see their face) when interviewing a patient in seclusion, and jumping out of the way of a patient even changed position, as if the patient was about to get up and attack them, and they would practically run from the room (or push the nurse further in front of them).  We didn't have security, WE, the nursing staff, were the security (the doctors had to go through the same crisis intervention training we did), but it always struck me a little funny that these couple of docs expected us to protect them.  Like we were dispensable and it's okay if we get hit, as long as it wasn't the doctor, lol. (To reiterate, Not all doctors, just a specific couple that were a bit on the nervous side, so I am not at all trying to dis on docs, there were some awesome ones that would get right into the nitty gritty with us!). Anyway, thanks for the memories.  :)"
mentalhealth,fohi41e,t3_g7h6vj,1587766360.0,"I'm sorry that you have to make a change that it sounds like you don't want, and that it is confusing.  Don't think that you did something wrong or anything, it's not your fault.  There could be numerous reasons, and she may feel like she is making a decision that is best for you, maybe based on something from her end. 

 It really could be that she doesn't feel her techniques are helping you much, and that maybe her way is ineffective for you, so she wants to refer you on to someone with a different technique.  She may be having some personal issues that she needs to lighten her patient load and so referring her patients elsewhere. She could be having her own mental health issues and needs a break, and doesn't want to leave you without a therapist, so is referring you elsewhere. 

 It really could be anything, or she really does think her techniques aren't helpful for you, and believes you will receive more effective help with this other therapist.  You also mentioned she has come across as mad or triggered, so maybe there is something you are dealing with that she is also (or has in the past) been dealing with, and it is becoming too much for her.  As much as she is there to be a professional and not let 'her stuff' interfere with her therapy with you, if it is effecting her to not be as therapeutic as usual, she might feel it is better for you both if you move onward. 

Remember she is a human being too, with her own stuff, as much as she usually leaves her stuff at home.  Sometimes it can become too much, even for therapists.  Just don't take it on, it is probably coming from her end, and nothing you did or didn't do.  I hope it works out with your new therapist."
mentalhealth,fogfke8,t3_g7ca2i,1587751940.0,"Sorry you are having a rough time right now.  I have seen several people post similar concerns as you have, losing their motivation to do their University schoolwork for various reasons.  So you're not alone in struggling.  I don't know if this will help, but this is something I have shared to a few people who are also having a lot trouble getting their schoolwork done----

In regards to your schoolwork, one thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task."

mentalhealth,fog29vl,t1_fof3jps,1587746854.0,"I was just pointing out that you don't go to one appointment and you're ""cured"".  Hopefully you will feel a little bit better after the first appointment, and your therapist can share some coping skills for you to try between sessions. Then you have to do those suggestions, and they can take some practise.  You can do it, but you also have to do the work the therapist suggests to you.  Think of it like learning to drive a car.  The first time you get behind the wheel you don't know all the maneuvers perfectly.  You can drive, and be successful, but you have to practise to get it all down, like parallel parking takes a few tries for most.  Eventually you get more comfortable behind the wheel, you know all the rules of the road, and you can do any maneuvers asked by a tester.. Then you beome a good driver, who follows all the rules.  Kind of like that, it's not you can't drive the first time, it just might not be perfect.  Hope I explained it a bit better.  I was worried the first comment would be too long, so I guess I didn't fully explain what I meant.  Good luck to you, you can do it!! :)"

It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task."
mentalhealth,fodj13b,t3_g6w9pt,1587685299.0,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but meds can take anywhere from 4-8 weeks to see good effects, depending on the meds, plus everyone is different and meds can effect people differently.  So two days is very very early to start seeing any significant changes.  Sorry about that, but you can always hope she is one of the people that responds faster than others. There is definitely hope she will get better, but it won't be immediately, it takes time.  

 In the meantime, please don't forget that you are important too.  You might want to consider getting yourself some support, even perhaps therapy, because being a supportive spouse can be very stressful.  It's okay to get support for yourself, so that you can continue to positively support your spouse.  It can be easy to burnout taking care of someone ill.  So do what you need to do for yourself, just as you want to support your spouse.  Think of it like when you are on an airplane, and they tell you that in case of an emergency, put your oxygen mask on first, so that you can then safely help others put their masks on.  Take care and hope your wife feels better soon."
mentalhealth,fodgxn9,t3_g6wgt0,1587684551.0," Here are some general tips I have been sharing  to possibly help with the isolation due to the virus, so I will copy it here for you to have a read----

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time, if you have people. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

Sometimes using **Distraction (Self soothing) techniques** can be useful too (especially during this time of isolation because of the health crisis). I will copy a list of activities I use to distract, and maybe some there will be some things you can try (revised list related to isolation right now).----

write a poem/story/journal

board games

books (read an old favourite, or find something you normally wouldn't read, to see if you can find something new to enjoy)

craft type kits (maybe start a new hobby that isn't too expensive)

do some chores/cleaning around the house, maybe it's a good time to finish any projects you haven't had time to complete.

exercise (dancing, stretching, skipping, anything that moves your body)

listen to music/songs/sounds you like eg: water sounds/thunder & lightening storms/whale sounds/etc

talk/phone/text a friend/face time/post online

relaxation techniques (Ex: progressive relaxation); deep breathing

sing songs

yoga

light scented candles/incense (relaxing)

take a nap

re-watch a favourite tv show/movie; or watch a new show that is out of your normal genres to watch, you may find something new you like

watch You Tube videos (Ex; Jelle's marble racing, ( [r/JellesMarbleRun](https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRun/) ) it is quite fun and mesmorizing) (and the kids might really like this, too)

video games; computer games

make your favourite hot drink, or food you like

write a letter to someone

take a bath/shower with your favourite soaps/bubble bath

read other stories on Reddit (check out some other subs you don't usually read)

Have you ever been curious about a topic, but never had time to research it; do it now, Google is your friend!

Look up a beginners online course for a language you've always been curious about; learn a few phrases

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

Also using **Relaxation techniques** can be helpful, especially if your thoughts are having give you some anxiety----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there.

3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

So it would be best if you tell them the truth, so they can treat you more accurately and provide better guidance to help you.  If you are worried about not telling them before, and now admitting you do, or have had, certain symptoms, you can always say you didn't realize or weren't sure you had those symptoms, or just be honest and say that you were too scared (or whatever you feel the reason is), and that it is worse now, and you realize you need more help now, so are trying to be more honest about your symptoms.  They are there to help, so the more honest you can be, the better.  Good luck, and do your best to be honest, it will really benefit you in the future and help you receive more accurate care."

So as hard as it feels, it would just be best to go forth and talk to your family.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task."
mentalhealth,fo5gtgh,t1_fo5f8jq,1587525297.0,"I know it probably feels very scary, to think of going to the hospital, but if you are seriously thinking you just can't control yourself, it might be the best option.  

Because when you really think about it, not to sound cliche, but for real, we are the only ones that can control our actions.  It would be your choice to go get a drink of water,it would be your choice to eat dinner, all the little things you do in a day, it's your choice.  Even if there aren't 'good' choices available, it can still be a choice, do I want to do ""A"", or do ""B"".  

So it is in your control to keep yourself safe, as hard as that seems right now.  The hospital is a safe place, with people there to help and guide you to a place you can make some safe choices for yourself.  They have resources there, to set you up with mental health professionals, while you are there, and to set up people you can go to once out of the hospital.  They are there to help you.  

Until you make the decision, try the coping techniques your therapist talked to you about, and maybe give some of the ones I mentioned a try.  They don't always just work the first time you try them, it can take practise and repetition to become effective over time. (Think about it like learning to drive a car, the first time you get behind the wheel, you aren't an expert, it takes practise and repetition to learn how to do all the driving maneuvers, learn all the rules of the road, and get comfortable driving, it can be the same with coping skills). So keep at them, have patience with the process.  And if you think it best, go to the hospital to keep yourself safe."
mentalhealth,fo5eo0g,t3_g5rq21,1587523827.0,"Can you be a bit more specific as to what kind of help you are looking for?  I'm asking because it sounds like your therapist went over the option of going to hospital, since you feel out of control and suicidal, but that it wasn't a reasonable option for you right now.  Then it sounds like she discussed some coping techniques to remind you how to control your actions/feelings, but you didn't find that helpful.  So I'm not sure if any other coping techniques would be what you are looking for, since your therapist went over some for you.  So that just makes me wonder if you want some alternative coping skills, or was there something more specific?  Because obviously if someone is saying they are suicidal and have a plan, it's a good idea to recommend getting checked out at a hospital, that's probably the way to keep someone the safest.  Another idea might be to call a crisis line to talk to someone.  If you are looking for alternative coping skills, I will copy some here for you that I have recommended to others before (so I don't have to type it all out again)------

 Using relaxation techniques can be helpful----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there.

3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

Some other things that can be helpful is to use distraction (self soothing) techniques. Here is a list I have that I'll copy here for you, it takes the isolation situation into consideration, so some ideas have changed to online activities ------

Jig saw puzzles (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

crossword puzzle books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

word search books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

paint by numbers sets (you can find some online)

playing cards (also can be done online)

drawing pictures

colouring books and crayons/colouring pencils (sounds juvenile, but colouring can be very relaxing and a good distraction technique; there are some online colouring available, mandalas can be fun to do)

write a poem/story/journal

board games

books (read an old favourite, or find something you normally wouldn't read, to see if you can find something new to enjoy)

craft type kits (maybe start a new hobby that isn't too expensive)

do some chores/cleaning around the house, maybe it's a good time to finish any projects you haven't had time to complete.

exercise (dancing, stretching, skipping, anything that moves your body)

listen to music/songs/sounds you like eg: water sounds/thunder & lightening storms/whale sounds/etc

talk/phone/text a friend/face time/post online

relaxation techniques (Ex: progressive relaxation); deep breathing

sing songs

yoga

light scented candles/incense (relaxing)

take a nap

re-watch a favourite tv show/movie; or watch a new show that is out of your normal genres to watch, you may find something new you like

watch You Tube videos (Ex; Jelle's marble racing, ( [r/JellesMarbleRun](https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRun/) ) it is quite fun and mesmorizing) (and the kids might really like this, too)

video games; computer games

make your favourite hot drink, or food you like

write a letter to someone

take a bath/shower with your favourite soaps/bubble bath

read other stories on Reddit (check out some other subs you don't usually read)

Have you ever been curious about a topic, but never had time to research it; do it now, Google is your friend!

Look up a beginners online course for a language you've always been curious about; learn a few phrases

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

\-

Also, it probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and do your best to stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc.  This is a good time to schedule in some distraction techniques, to keep your mind, hands, and body busy to help stop you thinking about hurting yourself.

\- - Also, there is also another Reddit sub that has a lot of good information, maybe check it out for further suggestions. It's called [r/SelfCareCharts](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfCareCharts/)

Hope you find something here helpful, and that you are feeling better soon.  Take care."
mentalhealth,fo4pa1h,t3_g5nz24,1587508597.0,"First---Honesty.  The therapist can not help what they are unaware exists.  So as difficult as it might feel to talk about some issues, the more open and honest you can be with your therapist, the more they can understand what is going with you, and the better the focus on how to help, because they know the whole scope of what you are dealing with.

Second---being open to trying the therapists suggestions/coping skills/ techniques, etc.  You have to be willing to try the skills your therapist suggests to you.  Even if it seems irrelevant (you can ask questions, to see why it might be beneficial, to understand it's relevance), and to be willing to really make a good honest try of the coping skills presented to you.  Sometimes things aren't something you just do once or twice.  Some things need to be practised daily, maybe even several times a day, for days and days, even weeks and weeks to see the eventual positive effects on your mental health.  So being open to trying, and being patient and willing to give things a good decent trial, before you declare something ineffective. Because some suggestions may have great success for you, and some suggestions may truly not work for you.  Everyone is different, so some things may work for one person, and may not for someone else.  But you have to really give them a thorough try to see if it helps.

Third---understand it is a gradual process.  It unfortunately is not something you go to once or twice, the therapist tells you some miraculous ideas, and you are healed.  It can take time, months, maybe more.  It can be slow, and tedious, and sometimes things don't feel better right away.  If you are dealing with some heavy stuff, it can feel very hard to deal with it.  But that can also be a sign you are doing some good work, because you are bringing up the hard stuff, and with guidance, your therapist can help you through it, albeit probably not as fast as one might wish.  So I guess having patience with the process is important.

I'm sure there is more, but this is already too long, lol.  Good luck with your therapy!"
AskPsychiatry,fo4jdac,t3_g5mcz8,1587505485.0,"Not a Doctor.  I realize you posting here that you would prefer a doctors perspective, so I hope you don't mind a non doctor also responding.  

Your situation sounds beyond frustrating and upsetting with all the run around you have been through.  It definitely makes a case for potential bias in your treatment.  Especially in this age of all the technology available, you would think you could get your treatment team from where you were living/working to send over some info (with you signing a consent or something for release of information) to your UK doctors, to be able to verify you were on lithium and quetiapine.  

I do get from a professional standpoint, that in this day of people, unfortunately, self diagnosing, they can't guarantee a person is not using this situation to get meds they *think* they should be on, from an unknown doctor, to just take their word.  But this was a doctor you previously went to, before moving, you would think they would have your past file to refer to, to know that you aren't someone trying to get away with self prescribing, and trying to 'play the system', so to say.  It also plays into the bias that someone with a medical issue isn't out to get meds they don't need, but someone needing psych meds, could be lying.  It is very frustrating and maddening.  Even just reading your situation is maddening. Even though you hadn't been to that doctor for two years, they would still probably have your file to refer to,  even if they need to clarify the current dose you are on (because doses could have changed in the two years you were away). I'm so sorry you have to go through all this.

I hope things get figured out for you soon, and that you get the meds you need.  Take care of yourself."

medical,fo3y07d,t3_g5dd56,1587494867.0,"Not a Doctor, only mentioning this based on my own personal experience, so please just take it is a possible thought, not a diagnosis or anything official.

A long time ago, I had these 'earthquake' like symptoms (where I honestly thought we were having an earthquake, because it felt like everything was moving, and I do live in a place that has occasional earthquakes; to the point I had to check the news to see if an earthquake was reported in our area, lol).  Especially when I woke up and moved my head first thing in bed, like upon getting up or turning.  Then I would have nausea, and dizziness upon changing my head position, feeling unbalanced.  Eventually went to the doctor. He did some testing in the office (the Dix-Hallpike test), and he discovered I have BPV ( Benign positional vertigo; aka BPPV  Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo), which sounds bad, but it's not really.  It's basically ""ear rocks"", and it is easy to treat at home.  Basically it is some of the natural calcium carbonate crystals that are in one's ear has become dislodged, and a piece is floating around in the natural fluids of the ear.  Nystagmus is one of the symptoms. So basically the treatment was something called the   [Epley maneuver](https://www.healthline.com/health/epley-maneuver) , which can be done at home, and a prescription to deal with the nausea.  

So I don't know if your girlfriend is having some of those symptoms as well as what you described in your post, but I'll post a link to a couple of  articles for you both to read, and see if it could be ear rocks/BPV that your girlfriend might be experiencing.  Remember this isn't a diagnosis, just sharing from personal experience.  Hope she feels better soon.

In regards to your schoolwork,  one thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task.

Here is a list I have that I'll copy here for you, it takes the isolation situation into consideration, so some ideas have changed to online activities.

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. If you are isolated with family/friends/roommates and they are constantly watching/reading/listening about it, and it starts to overwhelm you, walk out of the room or ask them to please not discuss it in front of you. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time, if you have people. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

Also using relaxation techniques can be helpful, especially if your thoughts are having give you some anxiety----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there.

mentalhealth,fo02q5c,t3_g4wnpd,1587405048.0,"As difficult as it will probably feel, talk to your Mom, and if you are actively suicidal, go to the hospital.  I know you might be worried that the hospital is mainly concerned about the corona virus right now, which they are probably busy with, but it does not exclude people with other issues from going there for help.  They are there to help all people, not just those with potential virus symptoms.  Your issue is just as valid.  If you are worried about going there, you or your Mom could possibly phone the hospital (or if you are in an area with several hospital choices) to see if they are open to having people with psych issues, to figure out which of your hospitals it might be best to go to. (they could be streamlining which hospital deals with which issues, to keep the virus patients contained to one or two hospitals; not knowing where you are, if you have several hospital choices or not).  If there is only one choice, go there.  If anything, you might just have to be a bit more patient in the waiting room, to wait to be seen.

So if you go, please be honest about what you are feeling and thinking.  They can't help what they don't know exists.  They can assess you, and figure out if you need to be admitted, or whether your situation is better as outpatient, but with resources/referrals.  They will help you figure out what option is best for you right now.  So just be honest with them, if you really don't think you are safe, tell them.  I know it will feel very hard, but they are there to help, but can't help if you withhold any information from them.  Help them to better assist you by being truthful.  Good luck, hope you feel better soon, and please reach out for help.  It is okay to ask for help."

mentalhealth,fnxkkka,t3_g4h22g,1587340569.0,"Sorry to hear your wife is going through such a hard time right now.  I get that, as a spouse, it is a pretty helpless feeling seeing her struggle so much, and not want to talk about it, so it feels like everything has gone wrong, and there isn't anything you can do to 'fix it'.

There are definitely things she could do to help herself, but the key is, she has to want to do them.  For example, a routine can be extremely helpful, it helps to reduce overall stress, helps you focus on what you need to do in a day, gives you something to work on, and helps keep balance, so that you don't over schedule one day, and under schedule the next.  So you could suggest she come up with a schedule to help direct her through the day, but she has to be the one to get up and do it. (Plus if she can do some activities during the day, and not sleep as much, it might help her sleep pattern become more normalized).  She can even start really small, as to not overwhelm herself, and schedule in a few rest periods, since she is sleeping all day, so she feels she is still getting some rest, but in between, schedule in some time to do hygiene, something fun she likes to do, time for a small bit of exercise (even if it is putting on some music for five minutes a day and just moving/dancing around).  Time to have something to eat, etc. Small, manageable pieces, like each 'activity' is for only like 5 or 10 minutes.  Then she has to trick her brain into thinking the activity is easy to do for five minutes.  Like saying to herself, ""I can get up for five minutes and comb my hair and wash my face, that's easy to do.  I can do five minutes"".

It is easier on our brains to make very small goals for ourselves, and achieve them because they are small, which boosts our mood in seeing that we were able to achieve our goal, and feel that sense of achievement.  Rather than set some goal that is unreasonable, to then have our brain tell us we failed, and feel defeated, and then not want to bother trying anymore because it feels impossible.  So small, manageable, achievable goals, slowly scheduled into our day.  Even if we have to 'trick' our brain into thinking it is easy, and even tell yourself you get to have a treat/reward, when we do that five minute goal.

So maybe you could sit down with her, suggest this schedule idea, start with just a couple of things for the first few days, and when she is able to do those, see if she is comfortable adding one more small goal.  As much as you can encourage her, she has to stay in control of her schedule, and her small goals.  You can be there for moral support, and ask (not tell) her that you will help if she would like it.  For example, let's say she decides she is going to have a shower.  You can ask, or at her request, assist her as to what clothes she would like to wear after her shower, and go and get those for her.  Or if she needs help washing her hair.  Or even just being in the bathroom with her to talk to her (mainly for distraction) while she showers, in case she needs you.

It probably sounds rather tedious, but for someone going through a depression, encouraging them to do a small task, as easy as it seems for the non depressed person, for her, it can feel like you are asking her to run a marathon, or climb a mountain.  It can feel so impossible for her.  So let her guide herself into taking positive steps forward, be encouraging, but not over powering.

I know you mentioned she doesn't want to talk about it, but let her know that if she changes her mind, and wants to share something, you are there for her, and are willing to listen (and be there to listen, you don't have to try and fix everything she is saying, just listen, and try to be understanding).  I do get it can be very hard to be the spouse of a depressed person, so during this difficult time, take care of your own mental health, too.  If you need a break, do something you enjoy.  Both of you might find some relaxation techniques helpful, even if you are doing them separately. Here a few that might help-----

Maybe find some activities she can use for distractions, and to help self soothe during the day.  Whether it be some art she enjoys, doing some online puzzles or games, or watching a favourite tv show or movie, or some activity you two enjoy doing together.  Remember to keep it small and manageable, and try to keep the line between encouraging her, and not becoming over bearing.  She probably feels quite powerless right now, not having control over the illness, so sometimes staying in control of the smaller things, like her schedule and activities, can help her feel like she has some control back. Also, I know it is hard during this health crisis, but if she has any professionals for her mental health, a doctor or therapist, perhaps she could check in with them to get some support.  Sorry this turned out so long, lol, I hope she is feeling better soon.  And don't  forget to take care of yourself during this difficult time."
mentalhealth,fnx8n2s,t3_g48rpk,1587333657.0,"Hi Op, I'm sorry you are having such a rough time with your mental health right now.  I know in this time of Corona virus, it seems like medical personnel are caught up in that, but they do still address many issues at a hospital.  So if you are feeling suicidal, it is okay to go to your local hospital and ask for help related to feeling suicidal.  If anything, if you are in an area with several hospitals, maybe phone one that deals with psych issues, and ask if it's safe to come in.  You may have to wait a little while in the waiting room if they are excessively busy, but they are still dealing with issues beyond corona.

So to me, it seems to make sense to just go to the hospital and ask to be assessed, to see whether you need inpatient, if that is what you are looking for, or resources if you that's what would be helpful to you.  Especially since you mentioned---- *"" The fact that the doctors will have to spend time trying to help me after I've overdosed when they could be treating someone with the virus""*\----it makes it sound in your attempt plan, you know that you will be going to the hospital, there fore sounds like you will either be reaching out after overdosing, for medical intervention (you mentioned *""fact""* and that ""*the Doctor will have to spend time helping""* you), so instead of overdosing, why not just take yourself to the hospital.  It doesn't lead to your mental health being taken more seriously if you 'attempt', so if your plan is to get help, just go and ask for help, instead of going through this plan of overdosing. 

Hope you decide to reach out for help, as hard as that can feel, it can be very beneficial, and help you get back on your feet and with better coping skills to deal with your mental health.  Hope you are feeling better soon."
mentalhealth,fnt35v6,t3_g3qlkp,1587233721.0," I've seen some other people post about having trouble to find motivation to do their school work/studies, whether it be because of depression/anxiety, or having concentration problems, etc. I'll copy a suggestion I made to the others here for you to see if it would help you, too (so I don't have to type it all out again, lol). The hard part though, is that it still comes down to you having to do it, even though you are lacking motivation right now. But have a read through, it might seem doable once you see the concept of breaking it into small, manageable pieces, using positive self talk, and 'tricking' your brain.--------

\-

One thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task.

You can do this. Set that timer, break your schoolwork into very small pieces, and do a time frame of work each day, and slowly it should become easier, slowly increase your time, and you'll eventually get your schoolwork done. Good luck!"
mentalhealth,fnt2jfn,t3_g3r2vq,1587233380.0,"For dealing with the memories/thoughts you are having with the past, maybe this will be useful (copying this from a previous comment of mine so I don't have type it all out again, lol)-----

**Letting go**\--------

I know this will probably seem really silly and dumb, but my friend and I used to do this to help get rid of things that we did that bothered us, or things we needed to let go.

We would write down everything to do with 'the thing' we wanted to get rid of from our minds. So whether it took one page of purging our thoughts/feelings, or ten pages. We just wrote down everything about 'the thing'. (If there was more than one 'thing', we did separate 'ceremonies' for each 'thing'). Just get it all out, everything you want to say about it.

Then when it was all written out, we would read out loud to each other what we wrote, we talked about it as much as was needed, answered any lingering questions, just talked it out until there was nothing left to talk about regarding 'the thing'. (if you don't have someone to read it to, just reading out loud to yourself is fine too).

Then the next step was to find an appropriate can/container to rip up all of our pages we wrote and place them in the can. Then we took the can outside, with a match/lighter, and with a bottle of water (to douse the flame after ward).

Then we set it on fire (in a safe place), said some words about we are now letting this 'thing' go, sending it out into the universe, and we will no longer be troubled/bothered/think about it ever again. Watched the flame glow, and the smoke go up into the air. Then douse the flame after it has burned up.

Like I said, sounds totally silly, but the whole process of purging the thoughts/feelings, writing it all out, talking about it out loud, then ripping it up and burning it, letting it go into the universe, was a quite freeing experience. (It may also have to be done more than once).

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. If you are isolated with family/friends/roommates and they are constantly watching/reading/listening about it, and it starts to overwhelm you, walk out of the room or ask them to please not discuss it in front of you. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time, if you have people. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

You don't even have to talk about your stressors, just check in with someone, talk about anything, shoot the breeze, just connect.  You might really not want to, but it really can help your mood. 

 Play some games or watch some tv or do some jigsaw puzzles, or word searches, or something similar (you can find some online), just something small and silly to distract and give your brain a chance to unwind and distract from your stress of work.  Pamper yourself in whatever way you feel comfortable and are able to do where you are. Do some kind of exercise, even if it is something like dancing around your house/apartment to some of your favourite music, just move your body.  Try to practise good sleep hygiene (I'll post an article for you on that, too, since you said you aren't sleeping properly).  Just take a break and do something good for yourself, to refresh and replenish yourself.  Open your curtains at home to let some light in.  If you have a balcony or patio, or some where outside you can be by yourself, go outside for a little bit for some fresh air, and read a book or a magazine. (practising physical distancing, of course).

It's okay to take some time for yourself.  You are going to be in for a harder time if you don't start taking care of yourself, and continue those hours.  It's okay to say no if your work is asking too much of you.  You have to be able to take care of yourself, before you can help other people.  

Here are the **Relaxation Techniques** to try-----

 

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there.

3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

Here's a couple of articles on how to practise good sleep hygiene----

mentalhealth,fnnp2eh,t3_g2t7rd,1587097757.0," Someone else posted earlier about having trouble with motivation to do their school work earlier today, and I have seen some others post the same concerns over the last couple of weeks. I'll copy a suggestion I made to the others here for you to see if it would help you, too (so I don't have to type it all out again, lol).

One thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task.

Also perhaps do some relaxation techniques to help cope---

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**.

3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

Also, sometimes using **distraction (also called self-soothing) techniques** can be helpful.

 Here are also some general tips to possibly help with the isolation due to the virus.  I have shared this before, so I will copy it here for you to have a read----

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. If you are isolated with family/friends/roommates and they are constantly watching/reading/listening about it, and it starts to overwhelm you, walk out of the room or ask them to please not discuss it in front of you. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time, if you have people. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

Sometimes using Distraction (Self soothing) techniques can be useful too (especially during this time of isolation because of the health crisis). I will copy a list of activities I use to distract, and maybe some there will be some things you can try (revised list related to isolation right now).----

**Letting go**\--------

I know this will probably seem really silly and dumb, but my friend and I used to do this to help get rid of things that we did that bothered us, or things we needed to let go.

We would write down everything to do with 'the thing' we wanted to get rid of from our minds. So whether it took one page of purging our thoughts/feelings, or ten pages. We just wrote down everything about 'the thing'. (If there was more than one 'thing', we did separate 'ceremonies' for each 'thing'). Just get it all out, everything you want to say about it.

Then when it was all written out, we would read out loud to each other what we wrote, we talked about it as much as was needed, answered any lingering questions, just talked it out until there was nothing left to talk about regarding 'the thing'. (if you don't have someone to read it to, just reading out loud to yourself is fine too).

Then the next step was to find an appropriate can/container to rip up all of our pages we wrote and place them in the can. Then we took the can outside, with a match/lighter, and with a bottle of water (to douse the flame after ward).

Then we set it on fire (in a safe place), said some words about we are now letting this 'thing' go, sending it out into the universe, and we will no longer be troubled/bothered/think about it ever again. Watched the flame glow, and the smoke go up into the air. Then douse the flame after it has burned up.

Like I said, sounds totally silly, but the whole process of purging the thoughts/feelings, writing it all out, talking about it out loud, then ripping it up and burning it, letting it go into the universe, was a quite freeing experience. (It may also have to be done more than once).

You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task.

Also perhaps do some relaxation techniques to help cope---

 

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there.

3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

Also,  sometimes using **distraction (also called self-soothing) techniques** can be helpful.  I have a list of things I use, that I have shared here before, and will copy here for you to look at, and see if there are some things you can try (it's a revised list due to everyone dealing with isolation due to the current health crisis).---

Also using **relaxation techniques** can help when the anxiety hits, here's a few to try (they can take some practise to get the hang of, and to work more effectively, so try them more than a couple of times before you decide if they help or not)---

After you have dealt with the part of the anxiety that is overwhelming, whether it was through using the STOP technique, or doing the relaxation techniques, or other techniques, and you are calming down and want to help keep the anxiety at bay, sometimes using **distraction (also called self-soothing) techniques** can be helpful.  To help keep your mind off the anxiety, and distract your thoughts onto a task, so you are focusing on that, instead of thinking all the thoughts that lead to your panic attack, and just keep your mind busy with little things.  I have a list of things I use, that I have shared here before, and will copy here for you to look at, and see if there are some things you can try (it's a revised list due to everyone dealing with isolation due to the current health crisis).  I know it can sound silly, like how is doing puzzles, or playing a game going to help deal with something so serious as anxiety attacks, but it really can be a positive distraction, I hope you will give it a try to see if it works for you-------

mentalhealth,fnm8qmd,t3_g2lh4k,1587067051.0,"I've seen some other people post about having trouble to find motivation to do their school work/studies, whether it be because of depression/anxiety, or having concentration problems, etc.  I'll copy a suggestion I made to the others here for you to see if it would help you, too (so I don't have to type it all out again, lol).  The hard part though, is that it still comes down to you having to do it, even though you are lacking motivation right now.  But have a read through, it might seem doable once you see the concept of breaking it into small, manageable pieces, using positive self talk, and 'tricking' your brain.--------

One thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task.

You can do this. Set that timer, break your schoolwork into very small pieces, and do a time frame of work each day, and slowly it should become easier, slowly increase your time, and you'll eventually get your schoolwork done. Good luck!"
mentalhealth,fnm7751,t3_g2ivhb,1587066289.0,"Yes.  Mental health professionals are regular people who happened to have studied psychology, but it doesn't exclude them from having an illness of their own.  Just like a regular doctor can develop a physical illness.  Studying a subject doesn't protect you from any illnesses related to that subject.  I am a psych nurse (now disabled and haven't worked for a few years) that has a depression and anxiety disorder.  I actually feel like it made me a better psych nurse, because I didn't just have the ""book learning"" knowledge, I had the personal experience as well, and I feel like it increased my levels of empathy, understanding, and compassion, regarding how it feels to go through those illnesses.  I even spent two weeks in a psych ward about 20 years ago, so I can relate to how it feels to be a patient in a hospital.  We are regular people, with regular health/mental health issues, just like everyone else."
mentalhealth,fnk2ldp,t3_g2600k,1587013148.0,"Hi Op, sorry you are having a rough time right now.  Retired (disabled) psych nurse (also have depression/anxiety) here too, and have a couple of suggestions for you.  You mentioned being on Buspar, but not taking it regularly because your anxiety isn't regular.  Is this something your psychiatrist recommended you do?  Wondering because Buspar works better if taken regularly, and can take a few weeks of continuous use to start to have good effect.  I personally am not aware (I admit I don't know everything, and have been out of the loop for a few years now, so my recall might be dodgy, lol) of Buspar working like a PRN.  Perhaps you wouldn't have the occasional meltdown if you were taking your meds regularly.  Just a thought. Here's a bit from an article about Buspar----

""Taking BuSpar

BuSpar tablets should be taken ***consistently*** either with food or without. It is usually taken two or three times daily. The initial dose may be increased by 5 mg every 2 to 3 days, with a maximum dose that generally does not exceed 60 mg.2﻿ Most patients respond to a dose in the range of 15 to 30 mg. BuSpar is slow acting, so it may take a few weeks to feel the effects. 

Your doctor will evaluate your situation and how you respond to the medication to determine the optimal length of time that you should take BuSpar.

Typically, the medication is taken for several months up to a year. When your doctor decides that you should stop taking BuSpar, the dose will gradually be reduced, to help avoid potential effects of withdrawal.""

Also I am sure you are aware of relaxation techniques.  I know for myself when I'm going through a really tough time, they really help me settle down.  I especially find progressive relaxation effective for myself.  Here are a few to check out if you've never done them yourself before----

Regarding your question about asking for benzo's.  I am guessing your psychiatrist is aware you are a psych nurse, so therefore knows you have some knowledge about medications.  So it might be best just to talk straight up about it with him/her.  Acknowledge that you are aware of the risks of benzos, and that psychiatrists are under a lot of scrutiny right now about prescribing potentially addictive meds, but that your Buspar is only helping with \*name the symptoms it helps, and ones it doesn't help\*, and you feel like you think it might benefit you to try a benzo for your 'meltdowns' (or whatever term you use with your doctor).  Perhaps include any information as to your risk factors, eg: if you have had any addictions prior, family history, any abusing of any type of substance in the past, current drug/alcohol use in conjunction with the benzo's if prescribed, etc.  You could always ask for a trial of a small amount of pills, to see if they have any effect when you are having your meltdowns (but I would seriously consider using the Buspar regular before you decide about benzo's, it really might help a lot more taken regularly, then making asking for benzo's moot.  probably just best to be honest and have a discussion with your doctor about the pro's and con's, and that you are educated about them, and that you will accept a no if the doc thinks it's best to not go down that road (your fear of being seen as a 'drug seeker').  If you are open and honest and accepting and willing to try other coping methods, it probably won't come across as drug seeking.  Good luck, I hope you are feeling better soon."
