unpopularopinion,fnu6e27,t3_g16ilq,1587255467.0,"I am a conservative republican from Michigan and I think these protests in Lansing are noting less than idiotic. 

Protesting is something I strongly believe in. It‚Äôs a way people can get involved with their government and make their voices heard. But now is NOT the time. People are DYING from this coronavirus. There a pretty good reason why schools, businesses, airports, parks, etc are temporarily shut down. People are becoming ill from COVID-19 and many people are dying from it as well. It‚Äôs a new disease that we don‚Äôt know everything about, and it‚Äôs irresponsible to live life as normal unfortunately. 

Can a republican like me support a democratic state governor? Absolutely. She‚Äôs doing what she‚Äôs doing in order to keep people safe and out of the morgues. People are angry that she‚Äôs ‚Äútaking their rights away‚Äù. What rights are you losing exactly? The only thing you guys will be losing is your breath because let me tell ya, if one person in that crowd of hundreds of people unknowingly had the virus, chances are everyone has it now. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs smart to be in a huge packed crowd while yelling and sending your possibly infected molecules from your nose and mouth into the air during a time where doctors and representatives are BEGGING people to stay inside, distance yourself, and avoid crowds of more than 5 people. I‚Äôm these protests not everyone was in their cars. Look at the pictures online. Look at the videos. Barely any masks were being worn by people who claim to have common sense.  These people are a false representation of all republicans and conservatives. These are far-right psychotic morons.  

I know y‚Äôall are mad that you can‚Äôt work,  but you‚Äôre not the only ones that can‚Äôt. America is under lockdown. Many many many many many other countries are locked down as well. Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre the only victims in this situation. We are ALL struggling. Stop being whiney babies, get the fuck inside, wash your hands, and this crazy time will be over. By PURPOSELY not following the rules you‚Äôre making it worse for yourselves and everyone else."

pedophiles are sick in the head, and they should all get **professional psychological** help for the sake of our children. **BUT** If someone's a pedophile, it doesn't automatically mean that they are **""evil"".** 

everyone deserves to be able to get treatment for their mental illnesses for the well-being of themselves and others.
