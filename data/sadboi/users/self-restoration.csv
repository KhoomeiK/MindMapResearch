selfharm,fo227ft,t3_g4ugcs,1587447510.0,"Just wanted to say that I'm here to talk to anyone who needs someone -- my inbox is always open.

But yes, OP, I relate very much to what you're saying. I'm bi, and I'm 21 now, but there was a time when I thought I could cut my attraction towards other women out of me. I started self-harming when I was 12 or 13, and it's still something that I struggle with to this day. I was raised by conservative parents in a super religious town with a church on every corner, and I was raised to hate the LGBTQ+ community -- to hate my own community. It took me many, many years to accept who I am and to not only hone my authenticity, but to love it. Even if it is messy. Even it does make such mundane things 1000x difficult sometimes. I've been attending pride festivals every year since I was 16, and I'm still terrified to this day every single year of going. I've loved other women, hard, and every single time I've had to shut down that little voice in the back of my head that lies to me and tells me that I'm broken and wrong and disgusting.

I'm not here to tell you that everything is going to be perfect, that you're going to get your fairy tale happy ending with a white picket fence and your perfect person to wake up beside every morning. Hell, I don't even believe I'm going to get any of that most of the time. But I will tell you what I wish someone had told me when I was 12 or 14 or 16. 

You are *not* the first person to feel this way, and you certainly will not be the last. You are loved. You are not broken. There is *nothing* wrong with you. It will get easier. Things will get better. You will find people one day who adore you for who you are -- for your authentic, beautiful soul and the equally authentic and beautiful way that you love. No, things will not be all rainbows and glitter 24/7, but you will, someday, be at peace with who you are, and you will like - sometimes even love - the person who stares back at you when you look in a mirror. You'll appreciate your scars and the story that they tell, even if you sometimes wish that you could go back and rewrite certain pages. 

I recently took a course on sexuality at my university. We learned about the Riddle Scale of Homophobia. Maybe not now, but I'd recommend giving it a look. It helped me a lot, to recognize that I have cycled through every single stage of homophobia during my life, and to compare that to where I am now. In this course, we also analyzed LGBTQ+ films, music, and other forms of media, as well as the history, which I also cannot recommend enough.

In my free time, I volunteer as a crisis counselor. Please reach out to someone if your feelings become unbearable, or if you just feel like you need someone to talk to. I promise you there are people who want to listen to your story. 

Here are some resources that I wish teenage me had known about: 

[The Trevor Project Support Center for LGBTQ+ youth & allies](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/trevor-support-center/)

[The Q Chat Space -- live chat facilitated discussions for LGBTQ+ teens](https://www.qchatspace.org/Learn-More#About-Q-Chat-Space)

And to anyone who is struggling with self-harm, I always recommend the [free Calm Harm app](https://calmharm.co.uk/) because it helped me immensely when I was younger, and I still have it on my phone now for when those urges pop back up. 

Above all, OP, please remember that you're not alone. Not in what you're feeling. Not in this world. Yeah, your community might be like mine was -- intolerant and not capable of understanding. Maybe even downright dangerous. But you've got people cheering you on. You've got me. Judging by the other comments here, you've got a bunch of other people, too. We're on your side."

college,exljqxv,t1_exlfdyn,1566414130.0,"I actually ended up getting a way better scholarship at the school that I transferred to. For my first year, I decided to attend a public research university with an in-state tuition cost of $7,000. I was stupid, however, and added room and board ($10,000) to that tuition cost. After grants and scholarships, I had to take out $5,500 in loans. 

After I transferred, my grades drastically improved. For my second year, I reapplied to a private university that I had originally got accepted into while in high school. The school that I transferred to has a tuition price of $31,000, and I decided to commute (room and board at transfer school is $9,500). After grants and scholarships, I had to take out $2,300 in loans.

 My grades have continued to improve since I transferred, which has allowed me to not have to take out any loans at all for the upcoming school year (my third year). If I keep my grades up and continue to commute, I anticipate that I will not have to take out any more loans for my undergraduate education. 

I transferred for a bunch of different reasons, honestly. I got into a sticky financial situation with school #1 the summer before my second year. Unbeknownst to me, my parents failed to pay a debt that I owed the school (I pay for my schooling, but they promised to pay this one debt because it was only a few hundred and they wanted to feel useful and make me stop hating them, I suppose). That debt was then sent to a collections agency, and I was unaware of the entire situation until I tried to register for classes at school #1 for my second year. By the time that I managed to pay off the debt, all of the classes that I needed were filled. I considered dropping out entirely, I considered taking a gap semester. It was a really bad situation for me to be in, mentally and financially. 

While I was struggling to pay off that debt, however, a bunch of accusations were made against school #1 regarding the high amount of sexual assaults on campus, perpetrated by some of the student athletes, and the lack of concern by the university. I didn't want to be associated with a school that was known for covering up shit like that, and for its partying reputation. The school that I transferred to is known for its safety. 

Lastly, at school #1 my grades were horrendous. I went from being a straight A student in high school to almost flunking out my first year. It took a serious toll on my mental health. My high school had less than 800 students, and I decided to attend a university my first year that has over 23,000 students. I wasn't able to adapt to the big lecture hall classes, but I earned A's in the few classes that I did have with small class sizes. The school that I transferred to has just under 2,000 students, and I am back to earning all A's."
