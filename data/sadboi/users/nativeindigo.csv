mypartneristrans,fplppkg,t1_fpl4we6,1588717114.0,"I can understand why it would make sense for your partner to cut their family out. You’re so right, it isn’t your choice. Which sucks. The best thing you can do is trust your partner & let them know you trust the decision they are making. While also giving them a reality check. Hopefully they open up & decide to respect themselves a little more."
mypartneristrans,fplnt1i,t3_gdnw2q,1588716092.0,"That’s horrible. He’s cheating on you right in front of you. I know you love this man, but you need to have more self-respect & step away from that situation. He’s made it clear that he doesn’t want to be with you. Regardless of the nicer moments, he is being extremely disrespectful overall & doesn’t deserve you. I hope you really take a look at the reality of your situation & figure how tf to get out of it. You deserve someone to treat you much better than that. I have also heard of this happening a lot, where when someone transitions they start having an attraction to the opposite gender they originally did. This was a fear of mine when my husband began transitioning."
mypartneristrans,fplmboq,t3_ge5xz9,1588715304.0,"It doesn’t matter how not ready she is, she made the decision to be with you & she undoubtedly should respect your name & pronouns. It’s disrespectful to not use someone’s preferred name & pronouns, being married to you doesn’t make it any less disrespectful. At least they/them wouldn’t even be as horrible. It was a little uncomfortable at first for me to start using opposite pronouns when I went from having a wife to a husband. I still did it though, bc it doesn’t have anything to do with me. It’s him. He came out 4 months ago & I slip up pronouns sometimes, I just correct myself & move on. That’s the respectful way to go about it. It’s okay to slip up sometimes. How would she feel if you walked around calling her a guy all the time? She probably wouldn’t like it. The domino effect is absolutely a problem. It only takes one person to make it confusing for everyone else. How confusing for others when it’s your wife. I wish the best to you in figuring out how to have a conversation with her to get your needs met."

mypartneristrans,fmi7svr,t3_ftp5fv,1586104151.0,"The ball is in her court. It is always her decision to be the one to choose when to come out to whoever at any point in her life, whether it be a family member or a stranger. I understand you wanting her to be out to your family. Being trans is very exciting & I think it’s much easier for the support of a trans person to want them to be out. It’s scary for them. Regardless if she passes or not, at the end of the it’s her decision. She needs you to be patient & let her do things in her own time. That’s the best decision you could make for her & your relationships. My husband & I both have a lot of unsupportive family members. Most of them just avoid talking about it & disregard it. Others have had a lot of opinions to express that no one asked for, yet have come around to find that being supportive is a better option to keep an important relationship in their life. However your Mom may react to the situation once your partner decides to come out, well, that reaction is on her. Be prepared for this to possibly change your relationship with your family. On the other hand, you may be surprised at some of the support you will receive."

MadeOfStyrofoam,fkpsbu4,t3_fjuqby,1584417993.0,why is this so accurate
BipolarReddit,fgb98t8,t3_exn09y,1580659768.0,I love this so much. Creating a subreddit for bipolar & sobriety combined is genius. Good job for being sober! It’s a hard thing to accomplish. Unfortunately a lot of people have misconceptions about mental illness & what bipolar actually looks like. I imagine it would be difficult for you to have a sponsor who doesn’t understand. I have been sober for 5.5 years. Having bipolar disorder while drunk......... bad combination. There’s a reason I don’t drink anymore. I’m excited to see what posts show up on this new subreddit.
ptsd,fg8fa1d,t3_excqll,1580617773.0,"First of all, good job for accepting your past & doing the work to show up for yourself in the best possible way. Just because she has helped others & won awards doesn't justify her abusive behavior. It's unfortunate how many people in the mental health field actually suck as actual people. It's hard to find people who will actually support you in the way you need. ""Just"" emotional abuse does not invalidate what experiences you've endured. I fully believe in karma, whatever she has done it will come back to her harder. You are not an awful person. You are a hurting person & that's okay. Feel those feels, get it out of your system so you can move on."
Dissociation,fg8dxnk,t1_fg7npb4,1580616672.0,"That's a good idea too. Whatever works for you - do that! Connecting with nature grounds me. Walking outside. Putting my bare feet in the dirt, sometimes making mud & squishing them around. Sitting on the ground. Feeling the wind as it blows the stress off of my body. Yoga. Trigger pointing. Meditating. Writing. That's just me though."
bipolar_irl,fg8dkjp,t1_fg7ltwi,1580616372.0,How relevant! I've been in a mixed episode for months. Your words are magical & all so very accurate to how I feel as well. Mixed episodes are the worst episodes.
CPTSD,fg8dfo8,t1_fg741hb,1580616263.0,"I feel that so much. I get silent real quick & I'm a talkative person. How are you supposed to describe how you feel when you can't grasp the concept of words? It just doesn't work. I understand what you mean about self-soothing. For me sometimes it works amazingly, other times not at all. I would not be able to stand being in the same room as someone who is that big of a condescending narcissist. What an asshole. I want to make sure I understand this correctly... so you said you're still carrying the burden of him & your mother's abuse. Do you mean it's the aftermath of dealing with the outcome of how they treated you? Or that & you mean they are still actively involved in your life? Or...? You deserve so much better than what they've put you through. It takes a strong person to survive through such horrible things. There are already enough unfair things in life, abuse should never be added to that. It's good to allow yourself to feel your feels, even when they get dark. Especially when you are allowing your dark side to be themselves, that's a part of you. You just have to get them out to move on & whatever works for you works for you. You certainly have a lot of weight to carry. It's amazing how helpful it is to self-sooth that inner child. Good for you. I'm proud of you. You're doing a great job. You got this. We both got this. I struggle all the time too, you aren't alone. Speaking for myself it's a full time job taking care of my mental health."
ptsd,fg7frli,t1_fg700qx,1580591426.0,"I've been in programs with those sheets before. It's different for everyone, I just used 5 for my normal. It's so difficult making any decisions when disconnected... any time in any type of episode, it's like, how do I know I can trust myself?! It's a scary place to be. I don't think it sounds silly at all. I have used those charts before, I haven't in a while though. I appreciate you bringing it up. Recognizing your feels is a game changer."
Dissociation,fg7eyqs,t1_fg6gb3c,1580590872.0,"I get that. I'm glad you have a loving family. It takes strong people to care for people like us. I will often have moments of clarity when I realize what I've been doing. It hits me in waves sometimes. When you're in it it's hard to see the extent of where you're at until you're out. Maybe you could carry a piece of your family with you. I wear a crystal necklace, when I am lost & actually remember I hold it for a while to remind me to be present. I use gemstones quite a bit to ground as well. It works when I use it."
BipolarReddit,fg7dgxf,t1_fg6fdk9,1580589855.0,We got this. I think some good sleep is exactly what I need. Even just a nice little nap. It's amazing how much these emotions linger. Thank you for your kind words. I needed them.
depression,fg7cpdv,t1_fg6eine,1580589340.0,"Thank you so much. Your words are exactly what I needed to hear. Sometimes that judgment can be hard to make, but ultimately when the plane goes down we have to put the oxygen masks on ourselves before others. It's always comforting being reminded that we are not alone."
CPTSD,fg7cakr,t1_fg69cpn,1580589062.0,I wish I didn't know what it was like either. I believe you fully. There are so many beginnings. Sometimes it has to get worse before it gets better. Thank you for your kind words.
CPTSD,fg7bo0x,t1_fg60c68,1580588634.0,"I do have someone that makes me feel safe & I am managing all of the basics. I don't have all good days, but I have some. I actually walk every day with the exception of the last 3 days, maybe that's my problem! There are a lot of life changing things happening at this point in time. Thank you for reaching out, it's much appreciated. I may message you."
depression,fg6ck67,t1_fg5wn8x,1580563724.0,It’s amazing how much credit we don’t give ourselves. I get what you mean. I’ve been trying not to set such high expectations for myself & recognizing how much I’m actually doing even if it feels less compared to where I want to be or where someone else may be.
ptsd,fg6ca44,t1_fg5vmjk,1580563436.0,It’s always nice to hear when others can relate. Thank you.
Dissociation,fg5v3ss,t1_fg5uyrp,1580540107.0,It’s true. Thanks for the support.
mentalhealth,fg5v1pl,t1_fg5ujn0,1580540039.0,"I am sure you will find your purpose in life. I’ve learned my purposes by following my intuition & listening to what is calling out to me. There’s a reason you’ve survived this long, there is indefinitely a reason why you’re still here. Retraining our brains to be kind to ourselves is one of the most difficult tasks I’ve taken on. I hope you keep telling yourself you aren’t a loser until you believe it. I am grateful to have learned many healthy coping skills in my 20s. DBT has changed my life. I’ve seen generations before me suffer unnecessarily so much while they are young, only to discover halfway through their lives they were never being their true selves & feel like they’ve lost so many years. I’ve learned what not to do, which I am forever grateful for. Thank you so much for your kind words."
depression,fg5umqi,t1_fg5u9ga,1580539549.0,"Yes. It impacts every aspect of your life. I think the hardest part is when it causes stress in relationships. Especially the ones closest to you. I try my best every day. It doesn’t always seem like it, I’m sick & that isn’t my fault. Then I find myself wondering - why do I feel so guilty?"
mentalillness,fg5u7tq,t1_fg5tou0,1580539075.0,Thank you. Yes I do. I have quite a bit of diagnosis. Sometimes I know how to differentiate one from the other. Other times my symptoms are so fluid it’s just straight up confusing.
depression,fg5u4dl,t1_fg5tnzz,1580538969.0,"I think that’s the hardest part - knowing that these moments will pass, but you have to wait for it to actually pass. I can distract myself sometimes & other times I just have to sit with my feelings. I like the thought of telling yourself that it goes away without warning. It’s so true. I also understand wanting to help others whilst experiencing your own difficult journey. I know exactly what triggered it. Stress is definitely a huge factor. Life things that just happen. It’s scary how you don’t recognize how stressed you are & how deeply your mental health is being effected until you hit a low point."
Dissociation,fg5tsnj,t1_fg5tlxy,1580538611.0,"Just gotta ride that wave, right?"
mentalhealth,fg5trd9,t1_fg5taha,1580538572.0,"When you’ve been suffering for so long it’s easy to forget the good things in life. I understand not being able to move on from the past. I’ve heard you have to open old wounds in order to heal them. I’m trying that, I’ll have to let you know how it goes. I don’t forgive some people in my past who have terribly hurt me, but I forgive myself for what I’ve done. I am not willing to forgive sometimes, but I am willing to accept. Acceptance is so difficult & one of the biggest steps to moving on. I feel like I have a purpose in life & I know what some of those are by following my calling. I think therapy can be a lot of things, I have yet to find ‘the one’ yet. I hope you find purpose in life. I have faith in you."
depression,fg5taej,t1_fg5s4b3,1580538070.0,"Heavy chest too. I hold my breath without realizing. Thoughts triggering me to tears. I feel you, I feel all those feels too. It sucks. How is one supposed to live with all these feels?"
mypartneristrans,ffjyg1f,t1_fffjkln,1580010409.0,"It was so beautiful talking to a variety of people. People of different generations, people their to express support for their kids, gay men, gay women, then of course my trans husband. They were some good people. Thanks for the encouragement. We definitely plan on continuing to stay active in receiving & giving support. It’s so important to hear others’ perspectives & to give your own."
mypartneristrans,ffjy4t9,t1_ffdlpq7,1580010162.0,"I’m sorry to hear you & your wife have had to go through so much heartache. It’s incredible how one can love, yet not support. It makes absolutely no sense.  Your wife is a lucky lady to have support from you, it only takes one person to make a difference. I don’t understand the grieving process, like yeah maybe you’ll miss things about them, but they are still the same person they’ve always been - just a better version of themselves. It’s so sad & unfortunate how many trans people commit suicide. It’s a significant amount. I’m glad your wife is still with you today, I’m sure your support means so much to her. You have probably saved her life more than once. 

Since I made this post my FIL preached to my husband over the phone & then continued to yell at him. He was going on about how this isn’t him & calling him by his birth name & female pronouns. He was gaslighting hard, it was extremely disrespectful. I now have complete disgust towards him. My husband still wants to figure out how to make peace with him, but I don’t feel too positive about it. My MIL told him this morning that she cannot accept him transitioning & that she would not be able to be around him because of his physical changes, but that she would use male pronouns when talking to him. Then my husband proceeded to tell her that they can have a relationship without talking to each other on the phone (because of the voice change on T) & without seeing each other in person. Then I guess she had a change of heart. My husband is excited about her all of a sudden support & acceptance. Which I don’t believe. I love my MIL as a person & have gotten close to her, but I personally cannot accept her full support because what’s already been said & done has happened. I’ve gone through this with my own family when I came out of the closet myself then didn’t receive the love & support that I needed. I just can’t trust her & I will only believe her when or if I see it. I still honor my husband in the decisions he makes & I support him in the relationships with his family that he wants to work through. I am in the sidelines of it all. I decided that when the time comes I will ask my husband who he wants me to talk to if anyone, then just trust what he needs me to do at the time. 

I appreciate you telling your story, it’s been insightful to me. I am okay with ranting. It’s good for the soul."
mypartneristrans,ffjwlwc,t1_ffdjxdv,1580008946.0,"My husband & I have very open communication. I am very supportive of him, I wouldn’t do anything he would feel uncomfortable with. I run everything by him, as this is his journey & I want to be as respectful as possible. We’ve discussed ways for me to support him, he says he just needs me to be here for him. I agree with this. I wrote this post to get perspective from others in ways that I could support my husband going through a hard time. This is the first time I’ve gone through something like this, it helps hearing what others have experienced. I’m open to anything outside of the realm of what I could possibly think of."

If you want anything bad enough you’ll make it happen. I believe in you! To me there is no career or any amount of money that would make me sacrifice my heath. I used to get that way at my job. I had to quit. I’ve learned that working full time isn’t a healthy option for me. Why torture myself if I don’t have to, yano?"

bipolar,ff85qyd,t3_es64c2,1579666747.0,I feel you. If it wasn’t for my spouse I would have stopped my meds again for sure. I’ve been on & off meds for the last 10 years. It’s exhausting. It’s ironic how a symptom of having bipolar disorder is to be in denial about disorder. It’s some pretty fun stuff. It’s also hard to admit that in order to be functional one must be medicated for the rest of their lives. So worth the reward though.
bipolar,ff85gmy,t3_es6ab6,1579666515.0,"I understand not being able to afford much, I myself do not live off of much money. Do you have insurance? If not there is state assistance for receiving mental health. I used insurance from the state for about a year since I couldn’t afford much until I got insurance through my spouse. I lived my life in a dysphoric mania episode just like yourself for 6 months even while still being medicated. It took a new dr & a new med to get my life back on track. Personally I know I would benefit from therapy as well, I’m just not ready to go back down that road, the thought of spending money on that doesn’t sound fun either. At the least I make sure I’m ALWAYS medicated, because it gets real wild otherwise. I am still trying to get back on track after a couple months of new meds. Dysphoric mania has been the worst of the WORST episodes of my entire life. Getting help is an investment. This is literally your life at stake.

With that being said I think it could actually grow your bonds & relationships with those in your family. Yeah, they don’t necessarily need to know. I think it’s more so about being yourself around those you love. Why not embrace it?! You know you have that unconditional love. I haven’t come out to my family as pan because they are very conservative & don’t understand or seem to care to know anything about the lgbtq community. They know I’ve dated both sexes, primarily the same sex. So for me that’s good enough. They don’t know that my husband is trans yet, so that may change the game for me soon.

Although my personal anxiety is a little different than yours I can understand the immense fear of having others witness your creativity. I am a writer & I struggle with others reading my words. It's the fear of judgment that seems to overrule all else, all logic. I take meds for anxiety as well, it helps. Meds never take it completely away. Smoking weed is my most effective cure. I enjoy smoking at night, getting a good nights sleep, then the following day my brain is functioning at a slower speed so I am able to rationalize my thoughts which lessens my fear. It also takes away all of the bad dreams, literally the best sleep I ever have. I smoke one to one (half cbd/half thc) vape pens, when I smoke them it makes me feel normal with less anxiety, but doesn't make me feel high. It works great to smoke throughout the day. RSO (Rick Simpson Oil) is magical. I put some on my anxiety meds & take it then it lasts the entire day. I pick one of the above depending on what I have & it's truly the most effective way I've ever dealt with anxiety. I do not endorse breaking the law, however if you have these legal resources in your state I highly recommend. I've gone through intensive therapy as well with CBT & DBT, which has allowed me to learn many healthy coping skills as well. Enough about me. I hope this helps."

I have primarily been in relationships with women, although I’ve had a few relationships with feminine men. I’ve never been attracted to MTF, but have always been attracted to FTM.

There is a lot of information online & in books you can find. Marsha Linehan is the one who compiled information to create DBT. I highly recommend checking her out if you’re interested. She has a lot of videos you can find on YouTube.
mypartneristrans,fen9om1,t1_femsdky,1579280005.0,That’s beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
mypartneristrans,fen9jow,t1_femmnio,1579279921.0,Thank you for sharing your experience. I really really really do appreciate it. I’m glad you commented. It sounds like you’re both in difficult positions. Maybe she just needs more time? Maybe there is a different root cause for what’s going on? I don’t know. Some people never get there. Usually because of fear of others’ judgments. I think it’s great that you are ready to be so supportive in such a scary process. Good luck to both of you.

mypartneristrans,fema8e5,t1_felw0tk,1579245665.0,It’ll be interesting what our experience will be like once they actually begin the transition process. My spouse is ready to start HRT yesterday. I can’t imagine what your experience was like. It’s definitely different for everyone & I could see how it would be scary for one to take the steps to completely alter their body.
mypartneristrans,fem9ux2,t1_fem2bav,1579245200.0,I appreciate your kind words. Thank you.
mypartneristrans,fellbl6,t1_felj65a,1579224910.0,My heart is full knowing that you’ve had a similar experience. I love hearing the positivity that comes from others’ stories. It’s occasionally been difficult for me allowing them to come out when they’re ready just because in the back of my mind there was a voice screaming at me to just tell them already what they didn’t know. Everyone has a different journey & must go at their own pace. It takes some patience for sure. Congrats on the engagement! I’m so happy for you two.
mypartneristrans,felkqbe,t1_felaglg,1579224512.0,"Your girlfriend is a lucky lady to have you as her person. What a beautiful thing love at first sight is. It truly shows your unconditional love for her. It surprises me so much how people’s sexuality plays such a big role in transitioning. I get it to an extent, I’m just a little more open minded than most. Being pan immensely helps in the process of supporting their transition. I appreciate the input of the perspective of it being more about sexuality than love. It’s so true."
mypartneristrans,felaxv1,t1_fela59x,1579217921.0,Thank you for sharing your story. That’s absolutely amazing that even through all of the confusion & emotions you were able to go from where you were to where you are now. It makes my heart happy hearing about others who have grown with their spouse through transitioning. Especially with children involved. It’s just so beautiful.
