Sneakers,fq5ofsq,t1_fq4vowi,1589112785.0,"I went downhill on what id consider a pretty beginner friendly street on my friends longboard and after i started to get some ok speed, i got the speed wobbles and at that moment i knew i was so very fucked. So im swerving side to side and im headed straight for this curb that without a doubt would have sent my t h i c c ass into some persons house. So like 20 feet before the curb, i did this retarded half jump/step off the board, landed on my right leg and slammed the street on my back which whiplashed the back of my head. I was probably full of adrenaline so i kept trying to stand up and my right leg just would not work, i got up and fell back down a few times before the adrenaline wore off and the pain hit. Worst pain i've ever experienced. I didnt think it was possible to feel so much pain. Luckily no head injuries but i shattered my tibia, its called a tibia plateau, after my surgery the doctor said it looked like a bomb went off in my leg behind the knee, because of all the shattered bits of bone. I had to get this weird contraption drilled into my leg at 3 different points and had to stay in the hospital with it attatched to my bones. I got a pretty dope scar from the surgery though. I smoked some bud and downed a few beers with my friend beforehand (which gave me the confidence to try longboarding in the first place) and i dont know forsure, but i think i prob would have got injured worse if i wasnt slightly intoxicated. You know how like drunk drivers, usually survive because their bodies are relaxed instead of tensed up before impact? I think it was like that. I didnt get a script for painkillers either because i was an addict for 4 years and just a few months clean and on a medication that blocks the effects of opioids, so all i could take was some advil for the pain. I got some titanium plates and screws in me now, but i still cant straighten my leg all the way, years later.  Physical therapy is really fuckin important to follow up on, i got lazy so my knee is like permanently slightly bent. Not noticable to anyone though. I can sense when its about to rain though, which is sorta cool."
