Decided to build the BFPTouch for the glass bed since I had a microservo sg90 laying around. It took a bit of fiddling with the z offset for bltouch config but it worked out fine! 
There's still a bit of ringing in the z seam and stringing. Other than that I would like to redesign the parts to be able to print at higher speed. Currently 35 mm/s at 240"

ender3,fnt55d8,t1_fnsvnms,1587234809.0,What was your fan settings? And printing speed? With 265 all metal sounds like you can go quite fast. Won't being expose to high temp melt your fan duct? Like my PLA fan duct melt while printing PETG
ender3,fnse13t,t1_fnsdjtc,1587219580.0,"Thank you for all your answers! I'm using stock spring so I have to level every print just to be sure. I do want a lazy way out to automate the printer and be sure that everytime I upload a print it will come out perfect, without apply hair spray even. 

What are the best tests do you think? I didn't want to waste filament to do a proper test and ended up failing 2 prints haha I'm still learning"
ender3,fnscaki,t1_fnsbspb,1587218434.0,Thanks. Should I use hot water? Also will an ABL help a lot with bed leveling

ender3,fns4559,t1_fns351z,1587212058.0,"Thanks for asking, yes I edited the e-step cal on klipper right after I installed the direct drive. It worked fine with PLA. Can you recommend a temp tower for PETG that only goes from 220 to 245? I have stock tube it cant go up 250. 

I read that PETG doesn't like to be squished down so I had the nozzle up a bit comparing to PLA mode. 

I'm using a single 5015 fan 24V, is there a way to visually see how the fan effects stringing?"

ender3,fns2dkx,t1_fns1fiz,1587210419.0,"Also the manufacturer temp recommend are 220-240 and 60-80. I haven't tried going over 240 due to stock tube. But if it's still printing at 225, does it mean the layers aren't fused properly?"
ender3,fns1xee,t1_fns1fiz,1587209989.0,"Thanks for replying! This is my first time printing PETG. I'm printing a case for my raspberry rn, reduced flow to 80% at temp 225. The nozzle seems to be little bit under extruding, but it's catching less plastic around the rim. I think it's because my bed is not perfectly leveled, the nozzle is catching some of the plastic everytime it moves. 
I'm observing it right now, adjusting the bed while its printing to get perfect layer. 
Thanks I'll definitely get the PTFE tube, still using stock tube and it cant go over 250. Do you recommend any good seller on amazon for all metal hotend like the micro swiss?"

I had the nozzle barely touching the paper. Used CHEP bed level gcode. 

Should I set z-offset further?"

books,eqhp5w9,t3_by900r,1560066277.0,"I remember asking my literature teacher in middle school about this. In vietnam, the traditional teaching is pretty much listen and repeat kind of thing. Kids really don't relate anyway with older idioms etc. And it's very hard to explain the author's intention if one's not familiar with his background, timeline, personalities, etc. But I think it all comes down to how widely known the piece is, and how people contribute to its meaning. May be its value is really based on the audience. The internet has helped creating/expanding popular sensations/memes that most people can relate with. It's very interesting reading different opinions on something we all try to relate to. Then it stops being the question of ""why the author meant that"" and becomes more like ""how do you interprete/like/dislike it"". What a time to be alive!"
