MapPorn,fozruoi,t1_foy3wae,1588195766.0,"I'm under the assumption that you are french as well. It truly does ""feel"" weird to mention ethnic minorities in those terms back home. Especially since there are no legal status recognising people as such (the Republic recognises ""Le Peuple Français"" not ""Les Peuple***s*** de France""). But if it's more of a political position to call it such *nowadays* (with a goal of preserving/revival of those ethnic differences), it was an anthropological reality back then, regardless of the political awareness of those minorities.

If you think of Spain, a western european country where those fights were led, most of the struggle between spanish nationalism & autonomy for the ""*Nacionalidad histórica*"" was exacerbated only recently, in the past century. Does a recent politisation means that ethnic differences were *not* a centuries-long reality?

On that basis, it is still fair to speak of ethnic minorities for the periods where it actually was a reality. Most forget, in France included, that the idea of a french national identity was born in a multi-ethnic country, and that the republic made sure that the country loses it's ""multi-ethnic"" quality.

You're completely right about social class playing a huge role. The lack of a ""proud"" or rich upper class capable of keeping the culture is probably why the process of acculturation (starting with the Jules Ferry laws) mostly happened unopposed. While it was bitterly fought against in Spain (since the Basque Country & Catalonia were rich parts, with established ""non-castillan"" upper classes).

&#x200B;

It's a fascinating subject, and a bit depressing too as a Breton. An easy leap of logic, when not taught history in respect to ethnicities, is to think that on top of being French(nationality), we've always been french(ethnicity, language, customs). A lot of us weren't speaking Standard French 2-3 generations ago. We should be mindful of this."

Otherwise (and this isn't solely directed at you), the idea of ethnic/nationalist struggles weren't *that* widespread in Europe yet, it makes sense to argue about the lack of ""anti-french"" liberation movements in the late 19th, but to boast about ethnic minorities *not revolting* at this time is either an honest mistake or disingenuous (republican propaganda). 

In the same vein, the idea of partitioning a country on an ethnic basis is anachronistic for the time, it wasn't all that trendy yet."

It's also another path to addictions and developent of other patterns, unhealthy ones. Those moments of clarity can be pretty ""existentially brutal"", full of anger and hatred and desperation when all you have in mind is the thought of how much you've been numb, stuck in the same situation, living only on ""day-to-day autopilot"". 

Pain is like a boomerang when undealt with. The less you feel it when you don't the more unbearable it will be when you do. Those moments of lucidity where you actually can process the pain and relearn pattern recognition become moments to loathe and avoid. Who wants to feel all of this? 

\- being in denial feels better (because if you don't accept pain it doesn't exist, right?). 

\- playing a video-game, daydreaming, reading/watching fictions feels better (because the mental exercises/emotional highs make the pain go away, right?)

\- Codependency, abusive relationships, or hypersexuality feels better (because being loved will make pain disappear,...and it ""still feels like love"", right?)

\- being bossy and lashing out at others feels better ( because ""bullying people to prevent them from bullying you"" will solve pain, right?).

\-Indulging in food compulsively, numbing oneself through alcohol, and on and on....

I see a lot of those behaviors in people that ""accepted that this is what life is"" and ""forgot whatever clarity they had when they were younger"" as you said, because that too began to cause pain. My response here touches more on trauma in general than this sub's topic, ptsd, specifically. But long-lasting traumas shapes behavior. And in my eyes, long-lasting coping mechanisms become personalities and identities, patterns repeated so many times it became unconscious doings.

The coping mechanisms were our brain's response to protect us, they did their job (at least the best it thought it would), but it's time to put the weapons down at one point.

It certainly was the perfect moment to kill Fredo, no one would have known, ever. ""He died in the coup"". But Michael has always been shown to be a calm deliberate man who thinks ahead, not one comfortable with ""thinking on your feet"" in a chaotic situation. He's a strategist not a tactician.

I just think he got caught by the moment. And his brain tunneled on ""*Me and my brother are in danger, but he is drunk, so i must get us the hell out of here*"". Any plan or punishment was out of the picture until they were safe (you can also read it as ""until he was in a safe enough position to actually think of any plan"").

What this *beautiful* scene told me was that in a situation like this, when the chips are down, when it comes to trust and instincts: Michael loved Fredo, even after what he did, and could not resolve to hate him, let alone abandon or kill him. Yet Fredo, even with his guard down due to alcohol, thought that he would."
Enneagram,fg47yqi,t1_fg3qxo3,1580498065.0,"Aye, the enneagram system captures shades of trauma well -- and each type is in some form how you shaped yourself over a preferred response -- but to me, reading this felt more akin to reading a post from r/CPTSD or r/depression than of this (light, more meme-esque) sub.

&#x200B;

OP, if you read this, it isn't negative to not fully fit a type description, most of what is written about the enneagram presents types as sets of behaviours instead of a framework, a core problem that we cristallized, is the cause of our behaviors, and that we must get rid of.

1) You aren't a walking contradiction. No feelings come out of nowhere, it's there for a reason. Your brain responds that way because of an A+B=C of past experiences, even if the response may seem irrational. This also means that focusing on ""why"" you react this way may lead you to it's resolution, wether it's on your own or (usually better) with therapy.

2) Fitting a type should not give you that distress, and if the enneagram had a ""bait & switch effect"" on you (as in hope of having answers by finding ""your type"", but ending up confused and disappointed because of not really resonating with any), chances are this ""wanting for answers"" comes from unresolved problems that still distresses you. 

I don't know anything about you outside of this post, but i'd suggest you go see a therapist, and inform yourself on trauma (especially attachment theory, childhood trauma & neglect,... r/CPTSD is a sub concerning these, maybe you will find some further information that may be helpful)."

eu4,fejob40,t3_ephq1f,1579181495.0,"I guess it's usual for ""Tall"" players to think of how they can turn an area into something worthwhile instead of judging it by it's current worth. Since economic ideas encourages you to ""shape"" your nation whereas ""Wide""s approach is take land -> state high-dev -> forget it for the rest of the game -> repeat.

Here's what i value (not in specific order) :

1. Size : 5 province areas are most times ""auto-stated"" even if said provinces have low development, while 3 province areas are unlikely to be stated unless they have a few redeeming factors to them.
2. Trade : 2 Trade center areas are ""auto-stated"" with the ""Protect Trade"" edict active almost always. Areas with only 1 TC wil usually be stated but it will depend more heavily on other factors. I might unstate a poor 1 TC area if i'm clearly the most powerful nation in the whole Trade Node, and give the statehood to a far better area or to a TC in a trade node where i'm a lot less influential.
3. Terrain : Farmlands and grasslands are highly favorable land while deserts, jungles, marshes, coastal deserts are unfavorable. Hills, highlands and mountains despite being unfavorable have a defensive bonus (+10%,+10%,+25% respectively) which makes them useful as defensive border-states (terrain + fort + defensive edict & appropriate estate).
4. Culture : the more provinces a culture has the better it is to promote it. The more dev the better too, but to me it's less important than the amount of provinces (as mentioned it's more about potential than face value). I'm definitely a lot less likely to state areas of a foreign culture if it has low-dev lands in jungles or deserts (ex: Garjati/Gondi in India, Bedouin in Arabia) or holds too few provinces (ex: Basque, Albanian in Europe).
5. Goods and buildings : Ever thought why Mazandaran has so much trade power while being a 2-4 province country? Most of the area produces Silk, which grants +2 local trade power. Cotton and Cloth's -10% dev cost = potential developed city. Grain's low price makes building a workshop not worth it, while it's land-force limit bonus makes the province more suited for the appropriate force-limit building. A 15 dev+ city that's not a Trade Center but produces a trade-buffing good (dyes,silk,incense,etc...) can be worth building a marketplace in.
6. Estates : One thing i usually do when i don't take the Quantity set is to make ""Orc pits"". I will state an area, give all it's provinces to the nobility (whoever gives a manpower bonus), build barracks, develop with mil points, and activate the ""Military Recruitment"" edict. The Nobility also gives a defensive bonus which makes them suited to own fort provinces. Of course use Burghers to maximise trade or production, Clergy to maximise tax-heavy provinces,etc.... Estates can be *extremely* beneficial if managed properly.

The goal is to stack bonuses/modifiers & double down on whatever your province's worth is. Wether it's in creating 30 dev+ cities out of nowhere, ""Orc pits"", Trade-focused areas, or hellish forts (aka Persia's Daisy Chain of Pain). An area might be unattractive at first, being poor with wrong culture, but if a city is on grasslands, has a TC and produces cloth, that's your next institution-pushed big city.

1. Taking Inno means getting Eco *sooner*. Which will prop up your economy to buy the better (and *cheaper*) advisors sooner as well. Generating more monarch points for various use, most those uses being cheapened by Innovative ideas already. It's a virtuous upward spiral, once it takes off it will only go higher.
2. 25% institution spread & -10% cost mixed with Economic's -20% development cost makes embracing institutions a non-issue, perfect for playing outside of Europe. Your neighbouring foes will easily be 2 Mil Techs behind from 1500 on.
3. Plenty of diplomatic points to spend on juicy goods such as gems,spices,paper,etc. Unjustified Demands as well.

EnneagramType4,f9epb3i,t3_e4oh9q,1575248002.0,"I  deem it to be more of a 2/3/7 trait. As far as i know, outside of Claudio Naranjo  associating his Enneatypes with DSM-III diagnoses and observations from  psychologists & psychanalysts, there hasn't been serious attempts  made by later authors to correlate psychological conditions with Types.

in *Character & Neurosis: an Integrative View,* Naranjo titled his chapter on type 7 ""*Gluttony, Fraudulence, and ""Narcissistic personality""""*, and here's the sub-chapter named *Narcissism* :

&#x200B;

>Another  group of traits that may be discerned as an expression of seduction may  be called narcissistic. It comprises such descriptors as  ""exhibitionist,"" ""knows better,"" ""well informed,"" ""intellectually  superior."" Sometimes this manifests as a compulsion to explain things, such as Fellini seeks to portray in movies where a narrator constantly puts into words everything that is taking place.  
>  
>We may speak of a ""seduction through superiority"" which most usually takes the form of intellectual superiority, though (as in Moliere's Tartuffe) it may involve a religious, good, and saintly image. The apparent lack of grandiosity in such saintly image is sometimes manifest even in the case of those who actively seek to assert their superiority, wisdom, and kindness. This falls in line with the fact that gluttons tend to form equalitarian brotherly relationships rather than authority relations. Because of this, their pretended superiority is implicit rather than explicit, masked over by a non-assuming, appreciative, and equalitarian style. As in the case of pleasingness, the superiority of ennea-type VII expresses only a half of the glutton''s experience; the other is the simultaneous perception of self as inferior, and the corresponding feelings of insecurity. As in ennea-type V, in both cases splitting allows the simultaneity of the two sub-selves, yet while it is the deprecated self that is in the foreground in type V, it is the grandiose self that has the upper hand in narcissistic personality.  
>  
>A psychological characteristic that is important to mention in connection with the gratified narcissism of the ""oral-receptive"" is charm, a quality into which converge the admirable qualities of the ennea-type VII (giftedness, percep-tiveness, wit, savoir-vivre, and so on) and it's pleasing, non-aggressive, vaseline-like, cool, and contented characteristics. Through charm the glutton can satisfy his gluttony as effectively as a fisherman succeeds with bait, which implies that pleasing and charm are not just seductive but manipulative. Through his great charm the glutton can enchant others and even himself. Among his skills is that of fascination--hypnotic fascination even--and charm is his magic.  
>  
>Along with the narcissistic facet of ennea-type VII it is necessary to mention the high intuition and frequent talents of type VII, which suggests that such dispositions may have favored the development of their dominant strategy (just as the adoption of the strategy has stimulated their development).

&#x200B;

At the end of the day no type has an exclusivity to psychological conditions (and general public's perception of Narcissism isn't the same as clinical NPD), but that's still pretty far from us envy-ridden ""Masochistic-Depressive"" 4s."

Hence their fear of anything that *could* happen to them.

Not handing back the New Territories would have been a breach of treaty and would have caused a diplomatic crisis. GB wouldn't have had either the legitimacy nor the military might to keep their rule (Hong Kong was indefensible and the garrison was more a symbolic presence than a truly capable one). The earlier 1842 Nanking treaty ceded the island of Hong Kong to Britain ""in perpetuity"", however the city grew in those leased New-Territories (which were also farmlands used to feed it) so negotiating to retrocede all but the island itself would have meant cutting the city in two and create a very costly supply burden. It was unviable.

And that's assuming that the 1842 position was negotiable in the first place. It was an Unequal Treaty after all, and China wouldn't have accepted anything perpetuating those insults, i.e. Britain keeping Hong-Kong.

&#x200B;

They had no card in their hands, no bargaining power. Thinking that they could stick it up to China and have their way would have been foolish and delusional.

Thatcher and GB might have ""acted stubborn"", agitated the image of China being a brutal dictature and claim they had a moral duty towards Hong Kong, but that's as wishy-washy as it gets.
