Antipsychiatry,fmng0vj,t1_fmm2k0z,1586225217.0,"both of these articles you put in this comment deal with amphetamines and, yes, adderall is an amphetamine but OP didn’t mention adderall. he mentioned wellbutrin which is an aminoketone (a non SSRI antidepressant). comparing wellbutrin to adderall is like saying dogs and cats are the same species. it’s just untrue. they utilize different receptors, are chemically different, and therefore have different functions. 

not only does wellbutrin work well for so many people as an antidepressant it was actually synthesized to help people stop smoking! it is a very well researched drug. now i know not everyone has a good experience with EVERY pharmaceutical, hell when i took wellbutrin it didn’t work for me, but that doesn’t mean it won’t work for someone else!"

Antipsychiatry,fmlpgus,t3_fvsohk,1586190817.0,"I'm honestly scrolling through this sub on the opposite side of the argument. OP please continue taking the Wellbutrin. one of my main focuses on school is how drugs affect you and I would like to go into the pharmaceutical research and development field eventually. Wellbutrin has been around for a while (since 89) it has been studied and observed for many many years (or it wouldn't have been able to pass through the FDA to get to consumers) and is tried and true. if it's working for you TRUST IT! it may not work forever but in the meantime it will make life more manageable. I personally have been on (for probably 8 months) and off Wellbutrin and I haven't had any lasting side effects whatsoever. keep taking it, but keep a journal of how you feel, any side effects you feel, or anything that might feel ""off"" and tell your doctor, they will be able to help you. these drugs are designed to deal with your brain chemistry. I get that it's scary, but doctors ONLY want what's best for you. take their advice. have a long conversation with the doctor instead of reading all the scary side effects on drugs.com or whatever. these drugs are safe and a life saver if you use them the right way and are honest to your doctor. I don't care if I get downvoted, I'm just trying to help OP. good luck my friend. if you have any other questions pm me."
