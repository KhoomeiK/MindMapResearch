mentalhealth,flm2xm6,t1_flls9in,1585273349.0,"> I got mine around your age and I have very good friends that actually got their driver's licenses when they were 23 and 24.  Heck, Lady Gaga got hers at 26 , I think.  Everyone moves at their own pace.   I thought it took me longer to learn than peers, and it felt so terribly frustrating and hopeless at times.  I was constantly filled with fear, but after driving VERY cautiously for a couple years ( I can say it took a long while to get comfortable), I  started to feel more comfortable. There are some situations that may warrant anxiety sometimes, but for the most part it won't always be that way. I wish you all the best, don't be afraid to ask for all the help and look up all the resources."
