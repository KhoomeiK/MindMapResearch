opiates,fr57blc,t1_fr47g7h,1589903764.0,Nah I got out of control with heroin back in the day. To be honest though heroin was cool but it always gave me energy for some reason. Except for at the beginning.

benzorecovery,fr56y09,t1_fr3pehs,1589903579.0,Eh it will help but won‚Äôt take the withdrawal away. It will mask it. Kratom has nothing to do with GABA
benzorecovery,fr56td1,t1_fr4mio2,1589903513.0,"Try getting on baclofen. It helped me tremendously with my withdrawal. Without it, I wouldn‚Äôt of been able to pull through. 2 years later and I‚Äôm off benzos and baclofen and 100% back to normal."
HPPD,fqvrhuy,t3_gl1h7q,1589683545.0,Absolutely. This is why I‚Äôm 100% sure HPPD has to do with GABA with me. I mean also no shit it does because I was a gaba benzodiazepine addict. It‚Äôs slowly been fading since I cold turkeyd Benzos 2 years ago.
researchchemicals,fqsf9ir,t1_fqqxzrn,1589605691.0,Yep. I‚Äôve tried just about every drug. The only kinds that scare me are benzos because of the withdrawal.

quittingphenibut,fp0erd9,t1_fowskcw,1588207853.0,Try a hardcore years long benzo addiction and then cold turkey and compare it to heroin. It‚Äôs a million times worse.
benzorecovery,fp0eke9,t1_foyo3de,1588207746.0,"Yes! Great advice. Just be honest. Don‚Äôt try to hide your anxiety and compensate for it. That was the best thing I learned in withdrawal was that if I was having anxiety around people, just let them all know! It gets a weight off your chest and makes the anxiety go down actually."
benzorecovery,fp0eeeu,t1_foyis3c,1588207656.0,Damn I couldn‚Äôt imagine being on a benzo that long.
benzorecovery,fp0ebz8,t3_gab4a8,1588207619.0,Ever since I cold turkeyd about a year and a half ago it‚Äôs been a slow journey to become right again. I still had tons of social anxiety while in a college class last year when I had thought I was over my benzo withdrawal but I wasn‚Äôt even close. It just takes time. The best thing you can do in these withdrawals I think is to push yourself into uncomfortable situations where gaba is needed. The body will slowly adjust and realize it needs to chill. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm 90% back to normal now.
quittingphenibut,fowpk00,t3_g9u1ee,1588124479.0,I would disagree tbh. Everyone‚Äôs different but heroin withdrawal is a walk on the beach compared to any gaba drug withdrawal for me.
AskDocs,fowok4t,t1_fou89aj,1588123906.0,"Mohave county. Yeah it‚Äôs weird like when I had really bad tonsillitis my fevers would only go up to about 99.9 and I was really sick. So I always know if it goes up a little, something is off. My temp is usually 97.5"
quittingphenibut,fown9ca,t1_fovvrr0,1588123154.0,You beat me to it. I can‚Äôt believe a doctor prescribed gaba for that.

kratom,foov9hn,t1_folbi4d,1587947194.0,I don‚Äôt think so no. I‚Äôve also felt bad heart palpitations from it. That‚Äôs a known side effect I believe. Well I was prescribed it for muscle pain but found out it worked great for anxiety.
kratom,foktimf,t1_foksd7c,1587848656.0,I‚Äôve been on baclofen for a little over a year.
kratom,foks0va,t1_fojr7zd,1587847837.0,Damn so can u tell me what kind of symptoms you have gotten? I‚Äôve been wanted to hear it from a phenibut user because phen and baclofen are so much alike.

kratom,fodabm3,t1_fod5sw1,1587682201.0,Right. I‚Äôm so over withdrawals that I‚Äôm not starting anything else consistently that could throw me down that path. I‚Äôll just take this every now and then. How many gram were you taking?
kratom,foda59z,t1_fod2cds,1587682145.0,Maybe because you have a tolerance to phenibut which is just like it. I didn‚Äôt feel anything from it other than sleep when I first got on it. Overtime though it totally messed my vision up.

Wow that just took me back to when I cold turkeyd. That gave me chills. I know exactly what you mean even though to most that would not make any sense at all. Cold turkey is one hell of a way to quit benzos but for me it was worth it in the end because I healed quicker. Stay strong friend. If you want to DM me I‚Äôm here. I found out what works and what doesn‚Äôt With meds and supplements in withdrawal."

But yeah, I‚Äôve went through benzo withdrawal and dose tolerance and i pretty much experienced the same visual symptoms. However these are a bit worse with baclofen. It might just be a gaba drug thing for me. I think my receptors are shot after so many years of gaba medications. Watch out for tolerance on your baclofen I‚Äôd say. I felt fine for awhile on the med and then it was like all of a sudden it turned on me."
kratom,foct8xo,t1_focs8zc,1587675538.0,Right. When I smoke THC all of these visual symptoms go away. I don‚Äôt smoke anymore because I just want to be off everything. Back to baseline.

kratom,focovsw,t1_focnzcd,1587673948.0,Yeah I was taking it oral. What‚Äôs weird is i was taking 60mg at night and I cut that down rapidly without noticing any withdrawal. Recently I was on 10 mg and I cut it down to 5mg and the withdrawal sucks now! Not to mention I‚Äôm pretty sure being on this drug for a year messed up my vision.
