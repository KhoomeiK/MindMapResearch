 If the plant has a rhizomatic (sp?) root structure you can clip off some of the roots and grow another plant. These are in between regular roots and bulbs and the roots will be thicker and less stringy.

The easiest most sure fire way I would clone friends plants was to take a decent size branch with like five or more leaves and put it in a mixture of vermiculite and uhhh those white pebble things."
