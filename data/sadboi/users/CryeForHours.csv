It's gotten to a point where I don't even know if I want to improve. I just want to give up, there's nothing I can do for myself anymore and I have no support. I've been in such a horrible position for years now and they only seem to give less and LESS of a damn about it. I'm so sorry that you have to experience something similar."
SuicideWatch,fqhrmcq,t1_fqhpww4,1589383014.0,"Oh my gosh! It's so bad! I remember the first time I went to a psychiatrist, I was recommended to be doing antidepressants and therapy, but my parent was like ""NO! THEY CHANGE YOU TOO MUCH!"" and I'm here like ""isn't that the point????"" and then after a few therapy sessions they went ""you can't go unless you pay"" even though at the time I wasn't even old enough to have a job and I know they are not financially struggling in any way. They also are always like ""you are improving see?"" when I mention anything. I'm just here like ""HELL NO I'M NOT!"" like what right do they have to say how I feel? It makes me so frustrated and disappointed. How can you force someone on this world and only make them want to leave?"

SuicideWatch,fqhpo1t,t3_gins3m,1589381878.0,"I'm going through exactly this! I have a narcissistic parent who constantly uses my depression as an excuse to give me punishment! They always say things like ""oh, why don't you ever come talk to us!"" whenever they eventually noticed I've relapsed in cutting. Like, why would I come talk to people who don't actually care? They'll always try to ""make it up"" to me whenever they notice, but then they use it as grounds for guilt and punishment. Yet, they always avoid the topic and dismiss me and how I feel. The sick part is that I know they're only trying to do these things to preserve their own self-image as to not be known as someone with a mentally ill offspring or something. I try so hard to not let it get to me and not cut, but it hurts so bad. I just want to feel something else, anything else. It's painful feeling so alone."

QualityTacticalGear,fq70jt8,t1_fq708ma,1589140223.0,RG is probably the most popular color of them available at the moment. I’m guessing you just barely missed out on it’s availability. Optactical has a live inventory on their website. There were only like 7 left when I ordered  (tells you how many there are when you add it to your cart)
QualityTacticalGear,fq6zmfc,t1_fq6z7br,1589139880.0,"On another note, the only important ship dates are the ones next to the items as the one up top is almost never accurate unless you order after confirming that everything you want is in stock, or if at least one of the things is and they will send it to you before the rest of the order. But they’d also send an email noting that"
QualityTacticalGear,fq6zdpy,t1_fq6z7br,1589139789.0,Yeah I ordered exactly that and it came Wednesday

QualityTacticalGear,fq6oade,t3_ge3pmg,1589135370.0,"I ended up just canceling my order. Emailed them and they confirmed that the ship date would be in October. Just order from Optac before they go out of stock again. Crye doesn't have a live inventory on their website. For future reference, if you need to order directly from Crye, ALWAYS email first in order to get the best experience, and make sure you aren't caught up buying something only to wait months. Otherwise, I would always look to Optactical or similar retailers first before buying direct."
tacticalgear,fpgk7ml,t3_gcrklc,1588604325.0,"Hi, AVS owner here. Carrier is great, however, honestly, it's a pretty niche thing unless you are actually having to change the configuration on a whim all the time. Otherwise, I would just a carrier that's already specialized for the specific thing you are doing. The AVS is something that can do most tasks alright, but not super great as it isn't specifically made for anything other than modularity if that makes sense. With the price point, it's definitely better to go for something that is better suited just for what you want to do with it. For example, a setup like this one is easily over 900 dollars not including plates, radio, etc. There's really no point in using it without the harness, so at a minimum, you're spending \~600 for one. Unless you buy some components used, but even then most AVS resellers scalp the hell out of them. Sorry for the paragraph. I just wanted to leave something here for people who are looking to buy an AVS."

PhantomForces,fl7y2n0,t3_fn23ik,1584911827.0, I would move the MBITR pouch to the off-hand side instead. MBITRs tend to get in the way and not really make sense on the side where you are shouldering a rifle. The GP/IFAK looking thing on the right would make more sense on the other side too.

""how is this true?"" you might ask. it's very apparent due to the fact that the nozzle and bbu are exactly the same as a KP-05 minus the fact that it was recolored to purple in the ssp-1. what is distinctive about those specific parts are that they are the only things that arent tm spec on a kjw. basically just means that to replace either you have to replace both. overall ssp just dumb gun to buy tbh lol, sure its easy to upgrade since literal kjw clone, but why would anyone pick one over a less expensive gun that's exactly the same"
