It's weird being depressed and trying to offer advice to other people that are depressed because we all know that nothing anyone says is going to help. Things suck. That's just life. We happen to be alive during a massive crisis and it's just compounding all of our existing reasons for wanting to die. I wish I could offer something more. I just hope that you stick around, if not for yourself, then for someone else, until you find your own reasons to be alive. Your friends, pets, family, the ones that WILL be crushed if you die.

AskReddit,flvnzcl,t1_fluyg0c,1585528073.0,"A very similar thing happened to me a few years ago. I was driving on a local highway bringing a friend home pretty late at night. She told me to slow down because she thought she saw a deer wandering into the road, so I did, and we both watched the figure until we realized it was actually a guy walking right towards my car, no shoes or socks, ripped up clothes, stumbling and flailing his arms. 

He wasn't stopping or moving out of the way so I stopped my car dead in the middle of the highway, and luckily no cars were on the road because he started touching the hood of my car, and I literally had to throw my car in reverse so he wouldn't climb on top, and I was then able to pull off onto another street and my friend proceeded to call the cops. 

My friend was actually friends with an emt at the time and told us that as soon as we got away, the guy got hit by a drunk driver. I wasn't able to find out what happened to either of them but it was one of the scariest things to happen to me behind the wheel.

You're not an idiot, you're just like the rest of us who know nothing in the grand scheme of things! But seriously, you don't have to worry about labels if you don't want to.

penpals,fljfzlg,t1_fljfdpd,1585210912.0,"I'm sorry I don't think you mentioned being confused about your gender, but either way, gender and romantic attraction are different. Cis is short for cisgender which means your gender identity matches the one you were assigned at birth. Cisromantic isn't a thing. 

I obviously don't want to tell you how to label yourself, but if you arent romantically attracted to men you potentially could use the term biromantic, romantically attracted two or more genders, so it doesn't mean all. You can also simultaneously be pansexual, meaning gender isn't a factor in who youll get into bed with. And you can also be simultaneously on the asexual spectrum. 

I know labels can be confusing and annoying but I personally like to identify ones that fit at least for myself. Hope this doesn't come off rude in any way."

I don't think it's true that rape, murder, and other violent acts are human instinct. An instinct is required for survival, it is inherent in all members of a species... eating is one. Rape, murder, pedophilia, etc, are not required for survival if you ask me. Sure in some circumstances people kill if they feel the need to protect themselves, but it isn't a basic need. We need to eat whether our lives are threatened or not. 

You talk about this being morally justified, do you think foxes and other wild animals have morals? The food chain and a power struggle are not analogous, the food chain is based on predator prey relationships in nature, based on instinct and survival. A power struggle is a political term and is based on the desires of greedy, power hungry assholes. Power isn't necessary for survival, eating food is.

You're asking me to justify the existence of natural processes and instincts which doesn't make any sense.  There's no argument to be had here, things exist, animals kill to eat, it's life... it doesn't have to be justified"
