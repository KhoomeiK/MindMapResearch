If you roast: mushrooms, onions, zucchini, and peppers and toss with some balsamic vinegar, those are really good together as a side or in a salad. You could also make roasted vegetable “spread” to go with a protein. I just roasted carrots and hot peppers with some spices and blended it with some lime juice to put with fish/chicken.

CPTSD,fo2qol3,t3_g5aal0,1587471586.0,"Yeah, I’d agree. My current therapist has also told me I don’t need any more knowledge or insight. My relationship to my emotions is really weird, I know I have them but I chronically go in and out of truly being able to feel them. And there’s only been one person in my whole life that I’ve ever gotten emotional with talking about my life or past. It’s just almost impossible for me to access those feelings and I know that’s what needed to be done to make lasting changes. Honestly, I’m just going to my current therapist because she gets trauma and I just need someone to talk to about my life even if it’s mundane shit. 

Anyways, alternative therapies are great and totally worth pursuing. Somatic therapy is just a therapy that takes the body into consideration and allows access of trauma from a different level than through the language center. Some people on the sub have posted positive experiences about somatic experiencing therapy. There are some ways of dispelling physical tension that I can recommend for at home use, including: “deep psoas trauma release” on YouTube; bioenergetic exercises (devaraj Sandberg on YouTube has some good ones) derived from wilhelm Reich’s theory about the body - I consider him to be the first one to account for the body in psychotherapy - and Alexander lowen who was a student of Reich also has some exercises you can look into. It’s my experience that I was not be able to release the full effects of bodily trauma due to an unconscious holding pattern that i discovered later on. But I still felt release and relief through these exercises. Anyways, I pursued neurofeedback toward the end of last year and after beginning training, I experienced a dramatic decrease in muscular tension that was so much a part of me that I didn’t realize it was there. Changed my life in so many ways. There are a lot of routes to letting the trauma go, you just have to explore what will be the best for you."

emotionalneglect,fnti82g,t3_g3u0i4,1587242173.0,"I just found/joined this sub and this is such a cool idea. 

I’m feeling okay. I just disclosed the full history of my childhood to a friend of 5 years on the phone earlier this week. I’ve been waiting for the opportunity to share and link a narrative together and she was exactly the right person to talk to. It’s the first time I’ve ever shared that with anyone outside of a professional context. The whole shelter in place feels like it’s been a progressive movement toward understanding myself and my history better. This phone call definitely brought a lot of clarity to me. I had a separate sort of revelation, piecing together ideas from different theoretical places and thought about how everyone’s psychology is developed in a two person format and neglect and other kinds of trauma are about dealing with our responses to that kind of subjugation. That we have always been treated as the rib of Adam and it is precisely the mastery in learning to be an equal that is necessary to overcome our histories. 

At the beginning of 2019, I went to a narrative therapist and together we created images and a story about my life so I could understand myself and my history, whose blankness was deeply troubling me at the time. I have been having a lot of intense feelings come up for me in the wake of an emotionally intimate and promising relationship. I imagined myself sharing my story with this person but I was immediately more emotional, just being with myself when I started to imagine and have this conversation. When I talked to my friend, it was completely casual and unemotional, just like with my therapists. I didn’t expect it at all, but this person seems to bring up a lot of intense abandonment emotions and fears in me (not in a bad way, like I can finally express to someone who will care sort of way). I found myself saying, “it’s not that bad” and “I’m scared you’re going to think I’m overreacting.” The second is a real and visceral fear I have about telling him. I told my friend on the phone it wasn’t that bad, too. 

I stopped practicing and thinking what the experience might be like. I watched the recording of what my childhood was like as documented by me and this therapist for the first time since the in person experience. Not even half way through, I found myself thinking, this is fucked up, I don’t want this to be my life, and was beginning to have waves of feeling like I wanted to die. I’ve forgotten some of the incidents that I cited in this narrative and wonder what that means. I’m scared of these feelings coming up in the future, I know they’re long from being eradicated from my body, if that’s even possible. But I count myself lucky for where I am right now, the progress I have made, and experiences, people, and anchors in my life now. I may have been deprived of being a person for a long time but it feels deeply in the past. 

Thanks for offering this space to share."

My most preferred style of hanging out is just being in the same space and is mostly related to conversation, much like what you describe. You could correlate it to personality type but I think it is overall just a question of values and how they mesh. There’s nothing wrong with valuing entertainment highly.

ptsd,fnq5iha,t3_g3aah7,1587158068.0,"Well, someone on the r/cptsd sub gave some really good advice which is to say and explain it in a very casual manner. I think the way that you act determines whether someone else feels burdened by your diagnosis, not simply an admission of having ptsd. This is important. Do you feel strongly that you are the one responsible for your emotions? You should, otherwise I would recommend working on that before you open up to anyone. It’s something I didn’t realize for a long time and it will not bode well for the health and length of your relationships. With regard to your second concern, I hope no one is that dismissive to you but it is a risk you take. Some people truly cannot wrap their minds around it, some can, and some will try to. You can use your discernment to feel out where someone fits into those categories but there will usually always be some level of risk when sharing this information. I don’t see it as a bad thing, rather, just a natural way of determining who is worthy of being in my life. Their reaction to you does not determine the validity of your feelings. You can try to use discernment with the third concern as well. There is nothing we can do to control the way that people see us and if someone does see you as lesser, they are a problematic and close minded person. You deserve better. I hope this is helpful."

Genuine curiosity that spurs exploration and learning should build on itself with the excitement of new things, new ideas, new questions. It’s not about being smart or knowledgeable, it’s about following your desire. Like others have said, you must accept that you can’t be knowledge regarding every area of thought but that doesn’t mean you’re inadequate. Respect yourself and others, they will inevitably teach you a lot. If anyone buys into this mindset and treats you like you’re below them for not knowing what they do, quite frankly that’s not a person worth your time. The world is more abundant to you and others when you accept, share, and teach what you know supposing it is not common knowledge, no matter what."

CPTSD,fnhmizf,t1_fnhkoto,1586965114.0,Good luck :)
Cleveland,fnhl6qh,t3_g1szt6,1586964434.0,Fuck yes!
CPTSD,fnhk1sk,t1_fngwm79,1586963843.0,I feel that! I always feel the most alive/excited/hopeful when I engage with people’s work who are so driven by their curiousity to forge ahead.
CPTSD,fnhjsr2,t3_g1p6cr,1586963712.0,"Try to apply for a different kind of job. It is just a job but that doesn’t mean it can’t still be meaningful or exciting. When I found my thing, it changed my daily life so much. I did end up finding a mentor in my space. Not exactly the kind you’re talking about but still. I know how hard it can be to muster the energy and concentration to really get applications and cover letters done but if you make the effort when you have just a little energy, it can really pay off. You can send me anything of yours that you want looked at. And I don’t know if I can help you but you can pm me and ask me any questions you want. I understand exactly that feeling you’re talking about."
ptsd,fnhib1h,t1_fnhgg9o,1586962930.0,"Me too, friend :)"
CPTSD,fnhhadi,t3_g1rlya,1586962385.0,I love this :) thank you for sharing
CPTSD,fnfn5bu,t1_fnerf4t,1586911389.0,"I am so happy for you :) this was beautifully written and the last paragraph really gets me in the best way.

“isolation and self-abandonment is basically one big flight response to emotional pain and the possibility of it” that is so goddamn poignant. I’m going to carry this one with me. 

Thank you for sharing your story and your insight xx"
CPTSD,fnej2l0,t1_fnee6og,1586890265.0,Can you say more about how you’ve approached not abandoning yourself?
emotionalneglect,fneel88,t1_fned50r,1586887979.0,"I completely understand. I really had to force myself to find value in still maintaining relationships. When I’m down, it doesn’t matter because of the depth of how alone I feel in the world. When I’m not, I’m neutral to happy I have people I can talk to about normal things."
emotionalneglect,fne8ky9,t1_fne7dnj,1586884957.0,"I’m sorry that happened to you.

To answer your question, yes I think this is very common among people who have experienced emotional neglect. Like I said, it has gotten somewhat better for me. I had to learn and accept that my emotions were telling me something and that they do matter. Very easy to forget for me, still. But once I accepted that, I was able to better more attention to how I was feeling and make better relationship choices. Then it took being around someone who has a very agreeable nature but was confident and consistent for me to start opening up to the idea that I can feel close to others. I don’t think it’s to the same degree that other people do and I absolutely internally struggle with what I need and what is appropriate for this type of relationship."
emotionalneglect,fne61la,t3_g196tq,1586883686.0,"Terrible in what way? 

Relationships haven’t been easy for me but I’ve gotten a lot better at them with practice. I am somewhat resigned to the fact that the depth of my needs will never be met so that’s the most difficult aspect for me at this point."
Ceramics,fndyo40,t1_fndyc5m,1586879928.0,Agreed
CPTSD,fndcjku,t1_fnd878y,1586866457.0,"My mind usually goes blank under extreme stress. If I do have something to say, I speak really slowly and am unable to recall words with great frequency. It is especially painful to watch my conversation partner think, “what is going on right now?” Mine is trauma related."
