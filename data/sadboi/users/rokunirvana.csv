This seems disingenuous on your part and kind of a low blow.  To go on a subreddit for Catholicism and bring the entire thread to a Catholic-critical forum and then blame them for being Catholic on their own damn forum is just really unethical, in my opinion.  I totally concur that Catholic doctrine  is out there,  but did you really expect them to provide feedback from a Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, humanist, or atheist perspective on a Catholic forum?  And, I read every response and none of them were disrespectful or cruel, so not sure at all why/how you were shocked, tbh.  If I went on that forum and said that Marian doctrine makes no sense at all and is almost certainly not true, should I be shocked if I were shot down?"
AspiePartners,fq1icbm,t3_ggbim1,1589045912.0,"You have just described my 23 year marriage in a nutshell.  Until we had children, I thought this trait (dreaming/visionary) was inspiring.  After becoming parents, I realized that I needed a partner, not an inventor/designer/ builder/ quasi-entrepreneur. My advice is this:  keep good boundaries, realize your can‚Äôt change him (23 YEARS‚Äîremember this!) and it is not a great co-parenting attribute should you ever wish to become a mom with him.  Best wishes to you."

We just ordered posters for her wall and she looks up Stranger Things memes.  She adores Elle and has a crush on Dustin.  I can honestly say it has brought a lot of joy to her life and entertainment to her quarantine experience.  When her adult siblings were that age, I wouldn‚Äôt have let them watch because of the sex scene with Nancy and Steve or the scene with Nancy waking up in Jonathan‚Äôs bed, but she goes to public school and is 11 going on 25, like most of them.  And,  none of it was over the top anyway.  The scariest stuff was the domestic violence with Steve‚Äôs dad and then Steve‚Äôs simmering rage and aggression, but it is part of the  storyline and I was ok with it."

AspiePartners,fpwjvrl,t3_g3xg6t,1588964736.0,"My husband had zero interest in my pregnancy (other than knowing he did not want the pregnancy terminated) or our first  child BEFORE birth.  He would occasionally kind of awkwardly pat my belly and say ‚Äúhello, junior, Hope it‚Äôs all good in there ‚Äú or something else to that effect.  However , in the delivery room the greatest miracle that day wasn‚Äôt the birth of a child, it was the birth of her father.  I literally saw his face change when he REALLY looked at her for the first time and it was freaky.  To be looking at someone and see the moment they are utterly transformed is pretty rare and incredible.  He locked in on her and never unlocked for 23 years now.  As an Aspie, I don‚Äôt think he could relate to something/someone he couldn‚Äôt see/hear/touch/experience but once he saw her she became ‚Äúreal‚Äù and was forever changed.  He has been and is an amazing father, despite his tendency to try and ‚Äúfix ‚Äú everyone he loves  and ranting when they push back and don‚Äôt want to be fixed‚Äîlol. (And when we were in our forties and I wanted to adopt a child and he didn‚Äôt, we moved forward and added a girl to our family.  Now, 11 years in, it is me who is tired and burned out and HE is the one stepping up to the plate and being an amazing father to our child with special needs, even though he is middle-aged and way over the hill to be a parent to a middle-school child.  He is a good person and stays the course no matter how hard things get.)"
AspiePartners,fpwhpmd,t1_fnujqhn,1588963644.0,"You just described my marriage in a nutshell.  It took me years to realize that my husband‚Äôs constant attempts to ‚Äúfix‚Äù me are his love language.  I have explained until I am blue in the face that this feels critical and unaccepting, but it goes in one ear and out the other, as he has no ‚Äúempathy‚Äù or ability to truly grasp any feelings outside his own. (Not in a cruel or selfish way, just missing that ‚Äúempathy ‚Äúchip.) He shows his love by ‚Äúfixing‚Äù, protecting, and being fiercely loyal.  His blind loyalty is DEFINITELY pure Aspie.  He locked in the day he said ‚ÄúI do‚Äù and has never looked back despite what would have surely sent most neurotypicals to divorce court many times over. Also, as a ‚Äúfixer‚Äù, he doesn‚Äôt give up when normal people would.  He just bunkers down and goes harder toward the goal (such as staying married or making me exercise/drink water/drive slower/etc)."

Anyway, don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre at with medication, but for me it works Hella well when I don‚Äôt do something stupid like quit taking it or ask my doctor to change it because I feel like trying something new for God-knows-what-reason.  Prozac is still my lifeline and changing to Wellbutrin in December has caused a terrible relapse I am struggling through right now, So I totally feel you.   (But I am through with the taper-down of Wellbutrin and should be starting back on Prozac again tomorrow‚ÄîTHANK GOD.  Only 3-5 weeks and I will be released from this Hell. ) What about you?

MarriedAtFirstSight,fp2bpph,t1_fp0unrw,1588258940.0,"Yes, which is Is why I wonder why they pair people like Iris and Deonna whose relationship speed is more like a glacier than a tornado in these situations.  Or someone like Matt who comes in with multiple red flags and a general ‚Äúsketch‚Äù vibe. Someone who is open and really ready to hit the ground running is clearly a better candidate for ‚Äúinstant marriage‚Äù than someone who requires infinite emotional coddling to move along.  I can‚Äôt fathom why some people even sign up for this or how they get chosen by the experts.  I thought Amber‚Äôs willingness to live with an open heart was beautiful and was crushed they matched that heart with the MATT‚ÄîWTF? She could have had a great match and she got screwed.  Keith could have also done well with an open, mature woman. The show did I neither of those two any favors.  You have to be emotionally grounded to adapt to the pace of this relationship on speed for sure."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fp2asug,t1_fp0nuu3,1588258467.0,I totally agree with your last two sentences.  Hey have thought the same thing.  I get sick and tired of hearing them all babble about it like they never get to revisit the issue after decision day.  Drama fuels reality TV and that‚Äôs the big drama on this one.
MarriedAtFirstSight,fp2akj8,t1_fp1v0hh,1588258346.0,Wow.  That‚Äôs really a terrible track record.
MarriedAtFirstSight,fp0r802,t1_fp0meey,1588215140.0,"It was fascinating television, though.  Seeing someone love someone else so unconditionally.  It‚Äôs a rare thing in anyone‚Äôs life and to watch it unfold between total strangers, especially when one of them was so resistant initially, was powerful."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fp0lp1n,t1_fp01vgh,1588211792.0,You can‚Äôt watch MAFS without seeing Jamie and Doug unfold.  That is MAFS of legend.  But I agree about seasons 2-4 at least.  Train wrecks.   I couldn‚Äôt make it through and quit halfway on Season 4.
MarriedAtFirstSight,fozyvua,t1_fozyakg,1588199344.0,"Greg is honestly just a great human being and I wish he and Deonna the best.  However, I never did warm up to her and found her incredibly remote and emotionally awkward.  Greg is so emotionally grounded, open,  mature, and relationally generous that I worried that he would not get his needs met in the long run with this particular match.  I was actually surprised that this couple was such a fan favorite."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fozy287,t1_fox5aky,1588198915.0,"Me too.  23 years in now and we were a hot mess for longer than a year.  We are both strong-willed alpha personalities and we were hit with multiple stressors our first year of marriage and it wasn't pretty. We had the love but needed time to work out the communication skills and fair fighting.  Even though my background is mental health and I ""know"" all the ""rules"" for healthy communication, our marriage challenged them all and we didn't rise to the occasion for several years.  It happens."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fozxhhw,t1_fovrcsa,1588198615.0,"Absolutely.  My own family has NUMEROUS examples of couples that fight like that for 30, 40, 50 years."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fozwtpp,t3_g9wyc7,1588198275.0,"They clearly had a love/hate, can't-live-with-you-can't-live-without you dynamic.  When they were good, there was connection, passion, and love.  Unfortunately, when they were bad there was toxicity and verbal abuse.  They are not alone.  The world is full of relationships like this, many of them long-term marriages."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fozr1rk,t1_foxw4bz,1588195371.0,Me too. Triggered.
BPD,foqmxzn,t1_fooeogl,1587997012.0,"Therapy isn‚Äôt the only treatment for BPD.  I have taken Prozac for 25 years to blunt my emotions so I never get worked up enough to ‚Äúgo off ‚Äú.  While it does work well, the trade off is having  my life emotionally blunted.  I have always been deeply emotional in both a positive and negative way‚Äîie crying at weddings, baptisms, first day of kindergarten for my kids, sappy commercials.  I was also always very empathetic and could really feel the pain of my friends and family which make them feel really known and cared for when they were hurting.  Now, I have the same walls or distance, I guess, that non-BPD‚Äôs do.  The positive:  NO RAGE-OUTS, no intense tsunamis of suicidal ideation, no rapid mood changes that leave everyone with whiplash.  But, the down side, for ME:  everything is just ok.  No major highs or lows.  Bleh.  I used to drive through the back roads along the creeks and through the forests of my home community and just absolutely trip out on it.  It was so beautiful it almost hurt to look at it, and I felt it at the core of my being.  It was like being engulfed and simultaneously transported by the sky, the forest , the water, the rolling meadows when I popped out of the trees.   Now, I‚Äôve gone from that to ‚Äúthis is a pretty drive‚Äù.   I am a mom and can‚Äôt afford the possibility of the rage and a wife whose husband deeply craves and deserves a stable spouse.  For them, I take Prozac every day and it keeps me stable.  But the cost....oh....the cost.  My cleansing tears, my empathy, my ability to experience such profound joy and immersion in the beauty of the world.  Basically gone, or blunted so bad it might as well be.  I also do NOT do therapy.  There is definitely a stigma, as OP stated, and I refuse to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù (girl actually‚Äîlol) to some stranger in an office. I have enough self-hatred for a lifetime leftover from my antics during my unmedicated  years and can‚Äôt stand the thought of exposing myself and being vulnerable and open about having BPD, even in therapy.  Even admitting it on Reddit makes me very nervous.  Stigma‚Äîabsolutely."
The100,foqjsnc,t1_fooeybe,1587995146.0,You‚Äôre welcome.  Keep them coming.  üëç
The100,foqjpea,t1_fopiebv,1587995091.0,Thank you!  I hadn‚Äôt even realized.  üòâ
The100,foocold,t1_folkhk4,1587936637.0,"Yes!  This is the moment when this show hooked me hard.  That moment was cinematic gold.  I have been watching TV since before  many redditors were even born and have seen a lot of characters come and go, but Clarke Griffin is one of the standouts hands down.  When she killed Finn, she showed a level of badassery, moral certainty, and leadership that was awe-inspiring.  Clarke goes where no one else will go without batting an eye.  Once she knows what has to be done, she just fucking does it."
The100,foo9wtj,t1_fon5a8y,1587935284.0,I always enjoy your analyses and this one is no exception.  Kudos.
The100,foo9nz2,t3_g87fx8,1587935164.0,"Her absence of moral compass.  Her victims 1.  Her own husband 2. The Grounder in the chamber whose blood she needed 3.  Bellamy when she had him chained up in the bunker 4.  Octavia when she threw her under the bus with the cannibal idea and 5. The young Prime she didn‚Äôt think a hot second about killing to get Kane back 6. Emori whom she would have also killed in the chamber to test the Night Blood.  Although she threw a bone at struggling with her humanity versus the brutality of life on the Ground, I think at the end of the day she really didn‚Äôt care who got hurt if she got what she wanted.  She made a lot of noise about being sorry or conflicted, but actions speak louder than words."
