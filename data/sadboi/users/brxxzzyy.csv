FrankOcean,fbbnyn8,t3_ec4722,1576704374.0,the entirety of seigfried.
SuicideWatch,fbamwxq,t1_fbafqew,1576682197.0,"same for me & thank you. i can relate, maybe thinking like this is better."
SuicideWatch,fb9qmbb,t1_fb8vyck,1576646365.0,"i feel you. always sleeping. it’s an escape. hang on, we’ll get through it."
SuicideWatch,fb8ktkh,t1_fb8gwpm,1576616076.0,"i’m sorry. i know that doesn’t mean much, but i hope things get better."
SuicideWatch,fb8gb2g,t1_fb8fds2,1576613293.0,"thank you for this, i know it probably wasn’t easy to recall these moments. i hope things are going better now."
SuicideWatch,fb8g4o5,t1_fb8eory,1576613175.0,how did the entire thing make you feel? what went through your brain when it was all going down?
SuicideWatch,fb8g0w4,t1_fb8clf0,1576613108.0,"on and off for years. just more now than ever.

i’ve tried other meds, i think the issue is just me. i’ll never feel better. i feel more emotions now, before i was more numb to everything. things feel more realz

nothing really matters. hm. we’re just little pieces of something so big. none of what we do have real impact. it just doesn’t matter.

peace looks like happiness. not having to fight to get out of bed in the morning or dread going out into the world and talking to people. peace looks like not having to constantly worry about everything. peace is just peace."
SuicideWatch,fb8c2fy,t1_fb8bmgl,1576610663.0,"this year i have contemplated suicide more that ever before.

my meds made me feel better for a while but i guess they stopped working. i’ve been off them for a week or so. i feel better than before but still.

sleeping is the only way i’m at peace. i can just relax. nothing to worry about.

i feel like nothing really matters."
SuicideWatch,fb8b9cx,t1_fb8ax1m,1576610165.0,"well, this year has been really bad for me mentally. the worst i’ve been in years. i haven’t been able to get anything done. i’ve been on and off meds. i’m doing terrible in school. when i get home all i do is sleep. it’s my only escape. i’m emotionless. just a walking body. all they care about is school and i can’t do it for them. everything else just feels pointless. i feel pointless."
SuicideWatch,fb8apkz,t1_fb8aizh,1576609821.0,i’m disappointing everyone. my parents keep telling me i’m just a walking corpse. they’re not wrong.

SuicideWatch,fb88xie,t1_fb8885u,1576608714.0,it makes them all the more special though. this way we learn to really appreciate them.
SuicideWatch,fb88tk0,t1_fb87hmj,1576608646.0,"agreed. sometimes i feel like the lack of motivation is saving me in an ironic way. 

now that i read this, i didn’t even consider that i could do it outside of my house and go somewhere else to. the idea of traumatizing a random stranger that would find me sucks though."
SuicideWatch,fb88kgs,t1_fb875y3,1576608489.0,we’re all just a small part in something so big. we live to die and that’s just it huh?...

SuicideWatch,fb87tjn,t3_ebyu9z,1576608027.0,"god, i feel like you just took everything i’m feeling and wrote it all out. it’s comforting in a way, to know that another human feels the same way you do. thanks for this."

Advice,f3ovcn4,t3_dhlutz,1571030007.0,"There has to be people with similar interests to you somewhere. Try joining groups, online or in person. Just talk and get to know people. You can become great friends with people even if they don’t share the same interests. Connections are just a conversation away. Put yourself out there. You got this."
Advice,f3ov3m4,t3_dhl8no,1571029735.0,"talk to yourself, not out loud of course lol. i find this helps a lot when my anxiety starts acting up, especially in social situations. let yourself know you’re okay and not in harms way. you’re okay, you can do this, it’s not a big deal type stuff. i know it’s kinda dumb but it helps me."
Advice,f3ous0d,t3_dhlkxo,1571029390.0,"At first the idea of spyware on her phone seemed like a breach of privacy. But now that i think about it maybe it’s not that bad of an idea. If she finds out though, she’ll probably get on you for being so paranoid. 
I’m the type of person that feels like a relationship is not much without trust. I feel like you would know a lot more about that than me though seeing as you have been married for several years.
She has been acting strange and off. Maybe a break or something would help you collect your thoughts and hers too?"
Advice,f3ou7j4,t3_dhkxsv,1571028858.0,"Unrelated, but i think your username is pretty cool. No need to change it."
Advice,f3ou5ku,t3_dhkxsv,1571028803.0,"Because becoming vegan is probably super tough and kind of a joke right now, i can understand where they’re coming from. But as your parents they should respect you and your efforts. 
You have a goal you want to achieve and that’s super cool! Even if it doesn’t work out they should try to help you. The best advice i could give you is probably to start putting in effort and showing them that you’re really serious about this. After that, hopefully they’ll understand and help you achieve your goal.
Best of luck op."
