Advice,fqfuvn2,t3_gionca,1589332157.0,"No I don‚Äôt you‚Äôre being illogical. I also think he‚Äôs dumb for thinking you should always agree with him. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve noticed a lot of business owners think they know best. However, I think you should think through whether you want to quit over this without a backup plan in place. If you do have a plan in place then go for it."
sugarlifestyleforum,fo9e9el,t1_fo7j72o,1587617136.0,"Idk I think it depends on what each person wants. I know both SDs and SBs that don‚Äôt want anything beyond the more transactional-like relationship. For example, I like hanging out with a SB and even going the whole 9 yards for that night but I do not want someone I‚Äôm in constant communication with or someone to hang out with outside of the scheduled dates. I specifically look for girls who want the same thing, someone who isn‚Äôt looking for something more involved. And there‚Äôs a lot out there that prefer this.

Edit: After reading a lot of the comments I will say that putting in a little bit of extra effort goes a long way no matter what each party is looking for.  Even though I want something with with little involvement there is a huge difference between women who put in the effort to make the date a success and women who dgaf. This goes for the SDs as well."

HPPD,flwbr4h,t1_flsv672,1585545354.0,What sort of symptoms? Also what do you mean during a trip? You took more? Lol
HPPD,flwb879,t3_frk1l4,1585544891.0,"Shit sucks man especially if a lot of your friends are into drugs. Ive got a pretty mild case so take that for what you will. I‚Äôve experimented a bit with drugs post-hppd but I will not touch psychedelics or ketamine. It‚Äôs just not worth the risk. I feel like this shit can always get worse. Stimulants seem to exacerbate the symptoms but only to a certain extent. I‚Äôve done both cocaine and adderall multiple times and have been fine. Benzos actually help but they are terrible in their own way. Opiates are fine but trust me, you don‚Äôt want to go down that road. The two that I‚Äôm unsure about are weed and mdma. Weed more so than mdma. It always fucks up my symptoms and makes them a lot worse but they tend to regress to my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù level of visuals within a few days. Idk if you suffer from a sort of brain fog from this shit but it also makes that way worse. Therefore I tend to avoid it. MDMA on the other hand I‚Äôll take once in a while. I feel like it does the same thing as weed but to a lesser extent. Eventually my visuals get better and since I don‚Äôt take it frequently it doesn‚Äôt seem to have a significant impact. That being said, you really never know what you‚Äôre taking."
tifu,flc64s1,t1_flc3no5,1585020903.0,Don‚Äôt try to argue anything about any drug to someone who uses that drug and doesn‚Äôt want to hear it. They can‚Äôt wrap their head around the thought that different people react differently to different things.
sugarlifestyleforum,fla5lvc,t1_fl9uemk,1584977123.0,You didn‚Äôt have to explain yourself. I was just genuinely curious why people are in this position. I feel like a lot of people had the opportunity to save money and didn‚Äôt and are now in a tough spot blaming others (not saying this is you because you are obviously going through a tough time).
sugarlifestyleforum,fl9abwx,t3_fmk042,1584946862.0,My question for people that are in your situation is do you really not have money saved up for these sort of emergencies? You were working full time and on top of that receiving bi-weekly allowances. It seems like you could have built up a nice emergency fund.
sugarlifestyleforum,fl999fr,t1_fl8mt8r,1584945653.0,Do you have an emergency fund saved up?
sugarlifestyleforum,fkdu3ao,t3_fhni8a,1584095207.0,Bro I don‚Äôt think the feelings are mutual. It seems like she needs your help financially and is willing to fake the emotional part in order to get it.
sugarlifestyleforum,fkdswag,t3_fgp7b0,1584093663.0,"Nope. But it‚Äôs definitely not the norm. The number of vanilla girls that don‚Äôt care if I use a condom is shocking every time I encounter it. A lot of the time they ask me not to. I‚Äôd say the majority of the time actually. SBs ask way more often than vanillas, which in a way makes sense but still. I‚Äôve definitely gotten used to testing often but I also know a ton of my friends don‚Äôt ever and would probably be offended if a partner asked. I feel like our generation really dropped the ball when it comes to being safe."
depression,fj54g9r,t1_fj090ym,1583023966.0,I‚Äôve thought about that too. Like if I found out if I had 6 good months to live would it change anything? I gotta say I think I would be able to enjoy it to the fullest and do the things I actually wanted to do without feeling like I put my future in jeopardy.
OpiatesRecovery,fj3iyxj,t1_fj3eh08,1582985060.0,Yeah it sucks that our minds get tricked into thinking it‚Äôs not such a bad thing. But when you put it that way it does sound ridiculous. Thank you!
OpiatesRecovery,fj3itgw,t1_fj34uwk,1582984929.0,"I totally get what you‚Äôre saying about being content not doing anything while I‚Äôm high, because that‚Äôs me too. But at the same time it also gets me through a ton of social things I‚Äôd rather not do without it. Take a few pills and then I‚Äôm way more comfortable at any event. And to some extent, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm more likely to do something I might find boring without it. For me I think the key to staying sober is figuring out how to feel that comfort without drugs."
OpiatesRecovery,fj3hh4l,t1_fj2ki2i,1582983745.0,I taper to cold turkey. The physical withdrawals aren‚Äôt too bad usually. I think it‚Äôs more the mental aspect of not being able to make myself feel better on demand.
depression,fj0oimk,t1_fizj4ep,1582904510.0,Yeah I actively make plans so that I have something to look forward to and once they come around I no longer want to do them and they are not as fun as I thought they would be. I know at least part of it is my thinking around it but I don‚Äôt know what to do to fix it.
depression,fizhs6m,t1_fiz5b3s,1582863181.0,Yeah this is exactly it. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle. I have no friends because I‚Äôm too depressed to care and I‚Äôm depressed because I have no meaningful friendships. I just wish I cared more sometimes.
depression,fiz1z8p,t1_fiyzzty,1582852243.0,I understand where you‚Äôre coming from because at 20 I also felt like I had already fucked up. By 23 I had turned my life around and was doing better than most of my peers. I‚Äôm saying that to say that it‚Äôs not too late to get your shit together.

depression,fd51ove,t1_fd1ncqc,1578173359.0,Yeah and there‚Äôs the possibility that they are also depressed and don‚Äôt know how to help either.
