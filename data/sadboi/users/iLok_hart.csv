Researchers are seeing that such things are happening in severe forms of BPD, (your AVH) in cases such as yours, with a history of trauma, so that is absolutely valid. What is also valid is the frequency of BPD and schizophrenia coexisting. It’s not outlandish to assume it’s the case.

The situation right now is that he’s avoiding perceived potential conflict at the expense of your security in the relationship. Unless he lives with them and depends on them financially, it’s ridiculous. I get wanting to avoid stress and pressure, but if you’re an adult, protecting your partner and sticking up for them is par the course. Hiding them away to protect them is unacceptable. 

So, you can go about it by Make sure he understands what the situation feels like to you.

“Matt, I wanted to let you know that you not telling your family about me has left me feeling very insecure in this relationship. As you know my previous relationship kept me hidden because he was ashamed of my body. That hurt me deeply and it’s making me feel as if you’re ashamed of me too. I understand you believe their will be conflict for some reason. While I’d love your parents to like me, I only need them to respect me. And if they don’t, I expect you to stand up for me, as I would for you. It’s important to tell the people in your life about the person you’re sharing your life with at the moment. I’m asking you to respect my feelings and the time we’ve put in our relationship.”

I’m kept my boyfriend away from my folks for a while because they have ridiculously high classes standards. But it by avoiding this encounter I was avoiding the opportunity for us to get closer and grow together. When my family says something mean or disrespectful I put my foot down. They are only to speak kindly and politely about whoever I’m with. If they have a grievance with evidence my door is always open. Until then, they cannot comment in a judging manner about my choice as an adult. 

So, I think you need to phrase it a certain way so he has the opportunity to make you feel better and be a good boyfriend, regardless of the outcome of the decision."

Unfortunately quarantine has put strain on a lot of new relationships and potential ones. If you can’t keep the chemistry going through witty conversation and diving deep in to know someone better, to create an emotional connection, the other chemistry can wear out. And a kiss won’t revive it if it’s too late. It honestly depends on the groundwork you’ve laid.

Generally speaking a kiss will increase romantic potential. A kiss says a lot. From what kind of lover you may be, to the bare essentials of physical fit (do our mouths fit together naturally), or even if you taste right to the other person (comparatively biology).

I can’t tell you what you should take, for me, I had an edge every day. And then something would happen and I’d go downhill very quickly. That edge was constant. Like waiting for the other shoe to drop. I personally don’t like the idea of chasing pain in any way, shape, or form. I take Wellbutrin XL, 300. It works for me.

But what I have noticed with girls that have had boys like them, but the guys never made a move, was poor social skills, lack of confidence and autonomy (you have every right to approach a guy, and if he turns you down it’s his loss, not yours), and overall low EQ.

Someone can like you, but they won’t pursue if you act like a terrified shy little mouse. If they DO pursue that, then they are predators. 

I’m very picky too btw. I still used tinder because you may meet online initially but you still have to meet in person. It’s not that different than seeing a guy you like across the room and deciding you want to talk to him, or being introduced by a friend. What you DO get is a chance to talk online for a day or so to see if it’s worth going on a date. For me, a picky person, that’s a god send. Because you can be model gorgeous but if your diet consists of meat and potatoes then gooodddbbbyyyyee. I have a very diverse palate. Picky, I know. 

Don’t shoot your self in the foot. Unless you regularly go out and socialize at bars, events, activities, you won’t run into different people. That’s what dating apps are for.

Actors who do the method technique don’t just return to who they were after a part. Their view of the world shifts and they become a new version of themselves with some of the characters traits. 

Coming to live with the acceptance of who you are right now is what is crucial. Backtracking to who you were before can feel horrifically gross. Like putting on old snake skin, or inhabiting a ghost (rather than a ghost inhabiting you). 

I have borderline personality disorder and much like DID patients we have these...schemas, or parts of our personality that are split, but we don’t actually split into different personalities. We just shift who we are to approach whatever situation is present. I used to be very scared about that because it wasn’t normal. But it’s me. I just have a different way of operating and I’m working on integrating all of these sides, but my priority is health and not hurting myself or others, and this “many me’s” doesn’t hurt anyone. Once I become accepting of my non neurotypical ways, I got to enjoy being myself more. Discovering NEW things, growing and changing without shame.

Focus on what goals you have for the future, and whoever you are right now is whoever you are right now. When I was young I adamantly saved myself for marriage. I went to school and then college and exposed myself to more liberal views and kind of wanted to be like the rest of the kids. But I also became fascinated with feminism, sexual liberation, and women’s history. I LEARNED and my ideas changed, albeit with the help of peer pressure, but supported with information and knowledge. I went ham and had fun. I’m still ME. I can be someone else and still be ME. The moment you can’t return to The idea of ME, is when you’ve grown and accustomed to a new way of thinking due to who you pretended to be, and it’s okay. You’ve grown and changed and learned and experienced the world through different eyes.

You will always be you. When you are not you, is when you go against your internal nature, and you’ll FEEL that. You’ll feel cognitive dissonance. In fact you’re feeling it right now because you’re trying to backtrack but it doesn’t make sense. You’re you. Beautifully you, with all your experiences and choices. It’s okay.

dating_advice,fpvwjn0,t3_gfveim,1588953111.0,"You need to approach your gf and tell her that while you respect her mother and their relationship, it is not healthy for her, you, or the relationship. Let me try to script it out:

“Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our relationship. Your mother has been putting an inordinate amount of pressure on you and our relationship, complete with a timeline and brutal comparisons between me and her husband. I’m having a hard time because YOU are suffering between loving and respecting your mother, and feeling conflicted in your own autonomy. I can’t exactly tell you what’s going on, even if I know what it is, because it’s not my place. What I do know, is I want this relationship to work, and I want you to have the support to make YOUR OWN decisions, and lead your own life. I would like to ask you to go to therapy to have that support so you can navigate everything with a professional, to reduce your stress, so you feel in control of the decisions and way your life is. A therapist is pro-YOU, so they won’t be influenced by your mother or me: they are neutral and will give you the best tools to relieve some stress and work through decisions on your terms. Would you please consider this?”

If she refuses, if she takes offense, your girlfriend hasn’t suffered enough from this entanglement to see how it’s affecting her life. I know what enmeshments, copdependency and manipulation is like. I still live with my mother and the only reason I haven’t tossed her off the second floor yet is I went to therapy, adjusted my behaviour and triggers, and by behaving differently to her, she eventually stopped using the same tactics. We came to a better understanding and I regained my power. People like my mother and your gf’s mother thrive off the feeling of control, because at some point in their life it was taken away from them. I’m betting her mother has a shaky past. Your gf needs to understand who her mother is and the place she creates her behaviour from. It’ll allow her to make decisions based on her mother as a whole and flawed being, not just as her mother (often comes with a lot of obedience and filial piety and the glow of the title).

Again, if she won’t go to therapy for herself, she’s not ready to have boundaries and redefine her relationship with her mother. Which means there is NO ROOM for you. At the moment at least. If there is no room and she’s asking you to tolerate watching the abuse and taking the abuse, then she’s not ready to be in a relationship. If I heard my mother comparing my father to my boyfriend I would have shut that down quickly, asking her to please respect my boyfriend as a completely different person, given it a different person and require a very different partner than she does.

Two days where sperm has to be Present to make a baby. Every day before and after that is cool.

Give her a treat even. Positive reinforcement. 

Also. Don’t leave food on the counter. We have four dogs, and we never ever leave food out, and they aren’t even counter surfers. It’s just part of our kitchen habit. The risk of a dog getting too interested is just too much to worry about and it’s a simple thing to put food away before leaving the kitchen. Crisis averted. 

As for moving her off your space on the bed or couch, don’t push her. She needs to decide she dislikes the sounds (air can) enough that she avoids going on the bed. And you reward the good behaviour. And do it over and over and over and over again."

If you are actively working on yourself, you are getting into an internal winter, where you will let the old things decay and die to make room for new growth (spring). Just focus on that, and people you KNOW you want to keep in your life, send a quick message to let them know succinctly that you love them, but are needing alone time to grow and heal. Let them know that you will do you best to respond to texts from them, and it’s okay to check in, and you’ll try to do the same, but right now it has to be about your own internal work.

It’s okay to create a safe space for yourself. We can grow in safety and reflection just as well as when in adversity. In fact the adversity is where we have quick growth. That’s what you have right now, the skill of being alone to protect yourself. It’s got potential but you have to look at it and make it work for you. You’ve seen it in plants all the time. Suckers or quick thin stems for roses. Usually what we do when it’s pruning time (self work in privacy) we cut out the growth that is not contributing to the overall health of the plant, and then we look at other small growth that will utilize the energy that isn’t being sent to the pruned places, and encourage it to grow sturdier and stronger (utilizing and honing you’re new skill to be beneficial TO you) :) if you have any gardening space or a patio I highly encourage getting to know plants a bit more.

^ this exchange allowed him to voice that he wants to be close to you. Not just bone you. You can also suggest these other options to sort of, prepare the ground FOR a positive response.

Conversely you can say this and he’ll go:

“Fine.” And be grumpy and have a shitty mood. That tells you he’s more concerned about himself and a shitty partner. Also if he pressures you, he’s a shitty partner. If he says “okay” and looks more SAD, then you can always prompt him by saying “I’m sorry I’m not feeling this way, but I DO want to be close to you, so can we do something else?” And list the above choices.

Also, if he’s a good guy, think about how HoRRIbLE it would be to feel his gf is just giving into his needs just because he wants it, not because you both enthusiastically agree.

You already know what it means because we’ve been culturally taught when we wear a man’s hoodie or shirt we are their girl. This isn’t a dream issue. It’s a next move issue.

depression,fot74as,t1_fot5nn0,1588046155.0,"It’s one of the main reasons I can get through the butthurt comments of people who don’t want to handle the ugly truth of what healthy behaviour looks like. Healthy behaviour isn’t easy or comfortable all the time, but it certainly isn’t suffering. Moments like this I LIVE for.

You are extremely lucky because not everyone with depression gets to that moment of realization where they realize their power over their life and body has atrophied due to the depression. The moment they feel a weak and unused muscle flex in a momentary triggered response it can mean the difference between a repeated toxic cycle, and the realization that they deserve better, can have better, and can do better. 

For those of us with mental health issues, yeah, it’s unfair, because we have to work twice as hard to be a functioning human, but when we GET there, we are twice the human anyone else can be. 

Please tell her that journey she is going to undertake is going to be uncomfortable, but every truth she learns will be a moment of empowerment. Every time she faces a setback and continues forward to try again, or try something new, she is reclaiming her place in this world. She will become the person that happens to life, rather than the person that life happens to. She will have super human empathy and a fearless power to communicate productively. 

And what’s more is that both you and her are witness to the transformation, that MOMENT. It’s truly awe-inspiring to see the pieces click into place inside someone’s head. For me I went from being so full of sadness and apathy, to RAGE. The AUDACITY of depression to lie to me and tell me who I was and what my life was supposed to be! As if the veil was lifted for the first time in ages so even when it went back down they KNOW for a fact what was behind it. When you know. You don’t have to cling to the idea or belief. You focus on getting the tools you need to keep that veil up and eventually rip it off. The TRUTH, the FACT is that she deserves and can have all the good things, and she’s going to damn well get there, kicking and screaming and raging against everything that once held her back."
relationships,foqz0s2,t3_g938cp,1588003306.0,"This is usually an issue about how someone is willing to their partner where their needs are.

Does he hate photos that much that it is impossible to take them with you? Can he not rework his attitude because taking photos makes you happy and that should make him happy?

My ex refused to do photos. When I finally demanded to know why, he said “the people you’re in pictures with says a lot about you.” Aka, he thought I’d bring him down. We didn’t last much longer after that. My boyfriend of the same timeline as yours, also dislike photos (unless he makes money off them because he used to model). But I told him it was something that made me feel good about the relationship. It’s a memory. It’s part of today’s culture and I participate in that culture. For him he just don’t didn’t quite see the point for himself, but it didn’t actually affect how he felt about life or anything to do it or not do it. He knew it made me happy so we take pictures. I instigate the pictures but he’ll pose and he’ll look at them and likes them when he see them. There’s things he’s wanted to do that I made sure I didn’t horrifically dislike and just didn’t really feel one way or another, and went along with it because it made him happy. And that made me happy. There are hard and soft limits in relationships and to be honest this shouldn’t be one of them. 

So, you should only be worried if someone doesn’t respect your feelings. Unless he has a big reason for not taking photos (which he should articulate well if he’s advocating for his mental health or feelings), there is no argument he can have when your feelings are valid and count. It’s a small compromise to make, and it shouldn’t even be a dramatic one."

depression,fopezj5,t3_g8s08a,1587959796.0,"So first of all, YOU are having the baby. Not him. While he was part of making it, you were the only person who decided to keep it. It IS your right to do so. It’s your body. He absolutely is entitled to make a decision about how he wants to be involved. Don’t take that away from him. The more you conceal and hide the more damage to the relationship you will create. 

Inform him. Let him make his own choice. He is required to pay child support, but he doesn’t have to be involved any further.  he can also terminate all rights to the child if you and a court of law agree to this. I personally think its fair to offer this especially if the relationship is casual, new, or has no time or investment to it. You are also both educated and knew the risk of unsafe sex so both parties are responsible and should have some options in terms of how to move forward.

I made the choice to have an abortion because I was not financially stable enough to support a child the way i felt he or she should be. It’s 2020 so I also didn’t want to depend on the father of my child to support both of our bad decision to have unprotected sex (id be on maternity leave for a while so the financial burden for a good majority of a child’s life would be on him). Seeing as the choice of abortion was available to me, and I already knew for years it would always be an option I was open to, I believe my partner should have the choice of supporting the child or completely letting go of all responsibility (aka no child support and you don’t even get to see or be near the kid). I gave that option to him, even though I knew it was my decision to keep it or not. He respected whatever I wanted to do, thanked me for giving him an option, and we both agreed an abortion was the right decision given where we both were in our lives. I like to think our decision was modern and fair on both parties. We are in a committed relationship so that does give our situation a different context. 

That’s being said the burden of a child still falls mainly on the mother so even if it is your choice to keep him or her, the father should provide support financially. He’s legally bound to do so. That’s why he can’t get out of it unless you and the court agree. But he’s not required to be your romantic partner. 

Tell him. You’re an adult now and going to be a mother. Time to adult!"

And while logically it’s okay someone else came in to the thing, because it doesn’t really affect your relationship, it still feels a little weird. It’s like a third wheel. You’re still boyfriend and girlfriend, but now someone’s along for the ride and it’s just awkward.

So, you can either mull this through yourself and focus on his actions and how he’s still prioritizing your time together, OR you can give him the chance to take care of your feelings.

“Hey, I wanted to tell you something, because it’s been bothering me and I want to get if off my chest. For some reason, I built our little apartment plan up in my head as OUR thing, the thing we do with each other. It was like a romantic modern version of playing house that felt right for where we are in our relationship. I did a lot of research for US so it felt like a big investment in our relationship. I’m happy your friend found an apartment here. He has every right to be here and you have every right to have a friend nearby. I guess what I’m trying to say is I just feel a little weird because a third wheel appeared suddenly and you never told me about it. I’m not saying you need to ask permission that’s ridiculous, but I’d like to be informed just as a courtesy because I felt like it was just a you and me moment of growth in our relationship. It was just an awkward feeling and It’s just how I feel, and it’ll be fine, but I had to let you know because I want us to be open and respectful of each other’s feelings always. “

Two different approaches. 

My boyfriend lives in a large family home and a family friend around our age moved to a section of the home. He did not inform me because he didn’t think it was anything and he hardly interacts with her. But I’m his girlfriend so I was a little weirded out. It’s kind of common courtesy to inform your partner of things like this. I’m not worried about our relationship, or have any fear of her threatening it, but being informed gives me a little extra dose of security and that’s really nice. It’s really just common courtesy. 

You should have been informed that his friend was looking for a place and he wanted to recommend your apartment fine. And in terms of psychology it’s always really nice when it’s framed in a way where you get to say, “oh he’s looking for a place? Let him know about our amazing find!” It makes it feel like a collaborative effort and increases moments of collective problem solving. 

That being said is it something to make a big deal of? No, but I’m a big believe in healthy communication so I just expect transparency and a certain amount of info about my partners life, because I’m in his life too."

That’s not to say they take the brunt of that in the relationship. It means when you can’t pick up the weight due to important circumstances, they can, and are willing to haul it themselves for the time being. 

My boyfriend suffers from major depressive disorder. When he’s at his lowest I know he can’t provide much for me, but I take the weight, and I ask him to at least check in with me once a day, and tell me he loves me. Because I know he’s struggling, his ability to do these small things for me allow me to feel loved, give me the drive to support him, be patient, and shower him with affection every chance I get. It’s hard when it’s sustained amounts of time, but we get through it and he’s getting better every day as he focuses on his mental health. He is a very giving partner too. 

So, I expect someone in your position need someone to create structure that makes you feel safe and cares for, because you’re falling apart when you’re home. For partners of high stress jobs like yours, it is a VOCATION. You need someone who is built to be strong when you CANT be, someone who lets you be strong when you CAN be.

Your views are not twisted. How you grieve loss is YOUR affair. You’re 21, so you have a chance to get back together with your ex, and you also have a chance to relearn the reason you left the relationship. You have time change your mind as well as make mistakes. It’s all okay and all slowed. What is NOT allowed is keeping people around you that don’t have to commit to for life (partners have potential life commitments), who do not make you feel good about yourself. It sounds like you have very good boundaries, and when she pushes them, you disclose how you feel because you think she wants to know, and then she punishes you for how you feel. Ditch her butt. I don’t play with that. Your feelings are valid and if her boyfriend was afraid of her she has serious issues that will push everyone away. Let her push you away.

BPD likes to sneak in milder versions of our trauma to reinforce itself into our lives when we are trying to get better. It becomes harder to argue with because we aren’t being abused right?

Someone on the board recently said something very important about the glamorization of FP’s, and 9.9/10 out of ten they are toxic and harmful to our growth. Much like having a toxic boyfriend, keeping someone around who tolerates you, because you feel you don’t deserve better (therefore they must be saints for putting up with you) is detrimental to your BPD. Making a conscious decision to back away from this friendship and see if she steps up and grows WITH you is key to recognizing if it’s a friendship or a dependency issue.

I’ve seen so many friendships with a BPD person where the non BPD person has narcissistic traits, and having a BPD person around them helps validate their feelings of superiority and control. They depending on you being sick to feel powerful. Be careful you’re not falling into that realm.

As someone who is recovered from BPD (yes it’s possible!) I can tell you that difference between friends I used to have and the friends I have now is extreme. The people I used to be friends with were manipulative, enabled my bad behaviour and then punished me for it, and contributed to my spiral. The moment the power dynamic changes as you grow stronger, you’ll be able to see their true colors.

Edit: for the record, losing an FP who isn’t emotionally intelligent or mature with strong adulting skills, isn’t a loss.

Telling him that you respect his decision, and you understand that your lack of communication led to this situation is all you can say. You also need to consider WHO your friends are. You can have male friends. That’s great. But a male friend who crosses a boundary like that? Absolutely not. He should feel guilty. You were half asleep and he touched you without consent. He engaged in an intimate act without the context of pattern (you all give each other the french kiss on the cheek sort of thing) or the context of a relationship (you and your boyfriend have this context).

This is a lesson to be learned. You have strong feelings but you didn’t have strong enough feelings to recognize your communication skills could damage a relationship. Therefore you didn’t prioritize it. And that’s OkAY. You’re young. Everyone learns a lesson about particular faults, usually through loss. This means if you want a successful relationship in the future you need to work on this.

This just might be a loss, with a crucial lesson. But my advice is to not bother him beyond telling him you respect his decision, you take responsibility for not confronting your friend as soon as possible and not communicating with him about the event as soon as possible. It’s a hard lesson but you hope he understands and will forgive you. Don’t even mention getting back together. remember, most people who have experiences with cheaters have seen someone who doesn’t take responsibility for their actions. For their choices.

The treat is going to be the big thing because once he’s on treats you can start to connect good behaviour (accepting touch and commands) with yummy treats. But right now you have to train him to accept good things, and that means carefully noting EVERY sign of positive behaviour, including an interest in a treat.

But you need to up the value of the treat first maybe.

I’d also not approach him standing. You’re big and tall and can be perceived as a threat.

I think making a point to actively make a choice every day to go outside and express some form of freedom that is still safe, while repeating a narrative of choice could be constructive. “im safe, I’m not trapped, I’m walking where I want to. Being inside is my choice and it’s safe. I am free to make a choice to go outside and I am safe. The things I cannot do are not a trap, they are to keep me safe and I recognize this. My priority is to protect me and my boyfriends health.”

There’s real truth to talking to yourself repeatedly. People make fun of the whole “tell yourself in the mirror you’re beautiful everyday” but science proves repeating statements can affect us. If someone telling us we’re losers makes us believe it, and if we repeat it over and over to ourselves in our misery that we BECOME it, stands to reason if we choose a more positive mantra we’ll have a related response.

He said he has an addiction. He said he deleted images. We find that he still has images related to his addiction from the time he was engaging in his addiction. There’s a big psychological connection there. 

He has lied and is HIDING this information directly related to an addiction. A recovering alcoholic who has a bottle of unopened booze hidden in the home is something to be concerned about. Why did they hide it? Why did they lie when they said it wasn’t in the house anymore? Any AA person would say that’s a big Nono.

Porn is cool. Especially if you know what regular healthy normal sex is and don’t model your sex life on porn, it’s super fun. If we’re all on the same page and OP isn’t shaming sexual expression and porn itself, we can move forward.

OP felt there was something odd going on. Something being hidden. Anyone who has felt this in a partner has personal reason to poke around when a relationship revolves around transparency of important things. There’s a different between personal privacy and concealing something potentially harmful to the relationship. Sure it’s wrong to snoop. But if there’s nothing found, the offended partner has every right to leave their untrusting partner. And if something is found, the snooping partner now has evidence that their uncomfortable feeling is valid. There are consequences to snooping and there are consequences to lying and hiding something relevant. Everyone eventually pays the Piper. 

That being said, OP should have discussed the feeling she had before snooping. And then given her partner the room to come clean if there was something he was hiding. It would have been a great opportunity for him to be honest, and say he still enjoys looking at the porn because it’s a kink, but he doesn’t have a desire to partake since he’s fulfilled by his sexual relationship with her. This could give the floor to a cool sexual exploration and role play in the relationship. 

I’d suggest OP act like she didn’t snoop and do what I said above, to see if their partner, when given the space and safety to come clean, will come clean. And then admit they snooped and apologize that they did so before coming to their partner first with their concern.

BPD,fonkdb6,t3_g856o2,1587921157.0,"A lot of BPD symptoms cross over with ADHD. BPD seems to be a massive conglomerate of top symptoms of others disorders hence why we get misdiagnosed like crazy. 

Memory is affected by emotion, and since we tend to be ruled by emotion it will effect how we store our memory. This is why we read subtext that isn’t there, misread subtext that is there, or ignore subtext. Based on whatever toxic narrative we stick to (our origin trauma) we will stick to a certain script of what life is, including the weird simple things. This makes it hard to integrate new experiences. 

On top of that, being stressed, pumped with cortisol, consistently being in fight or flight mode, black and white is the only thing that is relevant. To be able to survive we need very few pieces of data. The intricacies are just not part of the equation, even small intricacies we add in ourselves. 

In terms of brain function, the hippocampus is associated with long and short term memory, Spatial-orientation, and emotional reaction. Ours is in a state of continuous hyperarousal. Combined with psychological narrative it stands to reason how we store memory is impaired. We also have serotonin issues, and serotonin helps with many things, including memory. There are many serotonin receptors but in particular activation of 5HT2A boosts object memory and fear extinction, which helps reconsolidate memory rather than amnesia (being able to correctly process trauma rather than forget it). 

With such a whacky brain it stands to reason that in a test setting, we can recall things, but once our emotions go into play, our memory can be spotty. I mean, I can’t even remember all the times I’ve been called dolly daydream, airheaded, forgetful.....

In terms of personal experience, if I’m dealing with my emotions, things running through my head, tasks go out the door. I’ll go Up the stairs and forget what I was going to do. 

In other areas my memory is the sharpest of my family because it’s part of my survival. Unless I remember something, like an event that caused distress, I can’t process is properly unless I remember it. Being able to process it gives me the opportunity to see the causes, who was truly at fault (usually not just me, and not just someone else), the intricacies of the situation, and the trigger. In that way, I’ve been able to keep my sanity. Because no one can tell me what happened.

BorderlinePDisorder,fokalij,t3_g7vv20,1587838488.0,"Just remember that you have a choice in how someone treats you. This person didn’t treat you this way because you were no good. They treated you this way because THEY were no good. I’ve been in unfulfilling relationships before where it’s been like this. And during my BPD moments I felt it was all my fault. And then I realized how stupid they were for staying with me, wonderful me, when they could find someone much more on their level. Their very very low level. How sick and emotionally stunted must someone be to treat a loving giving partner as a second choice and mere part of their life that they tolerate? Go find someone you enjoy, and stop treating me like trash! I don’t deserve to be treated like that when I can find someone who adores me. 

Being able to push through the BPD illusion and see people for who they really were enabled me to make better decisions for myself.

You are wonderful. This is an unhealthy and abnormal way to treat someone, and therefore has no bearing on who you are. It doesn’t reflect on you at all. It reflect on them and how cowardly and messed up they are.

You are WONDERFUL."
depression,fok9n1k,t3_g7vyac,1587837984.0,"After quarantine, and another year or less, you are officially an independent adult. If you have the financial resources you get to choose what you can do with your body. Even then they might try to influence you, but the more you cling to the logic that at 18 you are your own adult, it becomes more like gnats bothering you. Even now my mother (I’m 29 and we’re quarantined together) tried to insist I wait to dye my hair darker until the morning. I asked if it was a time issue, because it was 7:30pm. She said no, it would just be better to do it in the morning so it would process better. I had to tell her that if it was imposing on her life, then I wont do it now. She kept arguing with me and I had to keep sayin, I don’t understand why this is a discussion or why it has to feel like I’m a rebellious teenager. It’s my box of hair dye, it’s not impacting your life, it’s my choice, I’m 29. This shouldn’t even be an argument or defense. We wasted 20 minutes in a heated discussion about nothing. I’m 29, it’s my choice that shouldn’t affect her or be part of her processing power. It just is. But it took a lot of my energy. I’m in this situation because I let myself believe for many years, once I was legal, that I was under my parents thrall. The result? Not being financially independent yet. At 29. So, focus on what your goals are. Remember that 17 is a blip in the scope of your life when you will be free to express who you are and who you love. Focus on creating the life you want to creating a strategy to be free. School work, college, part time job, moving out. Having control over how much you interact with your family and how imbedded they are in your life. You can do this if you want it. You have to want it with every fiber of your being. You can do it."

relationships,fojus6v,t1_fojtqv8,1587829820.0,"I have and will always stand by my belief that children are a choice, especially if you are educated and in a first world country with options. The factors involved in that choice involve a healthy relationship, both parties intention, and a strong love. You told me that those were not present. Your condition at the time confirms that. You cannot be truly present in a relationship if you are not sober, not free of a past love, etc. If this was a fully informed choice with all the elements of a long terms family unit with two parents being romantically involved, then you wouldn’t be here. You’d be happy and not tolerating a romantic life with your partner.

And now you’re in a position where this is a choice you have to make and There are risks to the children, which can and will be mitigated by the right execution! I know you’ll do fine. 

The main thing is, you both were really lucky how it turned out. And that’s amazing. You really were lucky.And that’s why some people stay in relationships with kids because it’s not HORRIBLE. But being lucky to the extent of just being okay, not mistreated, and just...friends, is not how you should except a relationship  or settle for, especially if you, as you say you are, incapable of settling. You are wanting a change. You can’t exist as you are now. As you said, your children are watching you as an example, and you all both deserve to show them what a healthy, really amazing relationship can look like, and how two parents can still be amazing if they’re not together."
relationships,fojqqm2,t3_g7usck,1587827372.0,"The only damaging thing would be if there was hostility. Right now they are very pliable.

You already know the marriage from the beginning was the wrong, the decision to have two kids was the wrong idea. You already know everything was the wrong decision, BUT you’ve been very lucky with how things have turned out. There is peace. That being said if you stay in this relationship, you might not have peace in the long run. If you start to resent him, become hostile, feel even more trapped, or, heaven forbid, feel pushed to the point of cheating, that would be even more damaging to the kids. Kids feel everything. And when kids start to understand and want their own relationships (puberty) it can be very damaging because they can feel the emptiness in their parents marriage. My mother and stepfather are incompatible but stay together because it’s just easier and they sort of love each other. But they are just NOT good partners. I had to see that. I had to see the arguments. The disappointment. The separate rooms. The hurt. Boundaries were crossed because my mother started to rely on ME as her emotional partner. Things just started to hurt and I’m still unpacking things at 29. 

So, execution is EVERYTHING. This could mean having a LONG sit down talk with your partner about what you feel is right for you. That you don’t want to stay in something just for the kids, but you also don’t want to have hostility involved. You want to show them that two people can move on and find happiness and love, still respect each other and even love each other as people, and STILL their priority is being a good mother and father. I think focusing on the goal, which centers on them is important. 

From my point of view, no one should stay together in a marriage/relationship m for the kids. You stay together as PARENTS, as a UNIT for the kids. 

So, if this is really important to you, perhaps bring your partner to therapy with you to discuss this on neutral territory. No matter what happens, YOU keep your cool. People can have peaceful and amicable divorces and their kids are absolutely fine, but you have to be responsible for yourself, and hope your partner prioritizes the kids and not his pride. You deal with your feelings together or privately, but not in front of the kids. In the end if he loses his cool he will have to live with the consequences of the kids seeing that. 

But they’re young and pliable as I said. You can normalize this and make this as non scary as possible! Because the priority in the family is everyone must feel loved, happy, and respected. That means maybe mommy and daddy live apart but close, and try something new! You can still have family vacations. It will just be different. Maybe you’ll have to get Airbnb with two bedrooms and the kids sleep in the living room with tv! You have to figure it out. Maybe family vacation can be a day thing, like Disneyland. Or family dinner. I have family dinner every Sunday with my mom; my dad, and my stepdad. The four of us. My dads girlfriend isn’t invited because she’s not part of the family and is disliked by everyone except my father (naturally, but she did some shady shit when I was young so that’s HER bed she gets to lie in). But we all get together and everyone cares about each other. My dad calls my stepdad cousin, and thinks it’s pretty funny (they’re both chinese). So despite the separation being not fun, there are some things my parents got right. To continue keeping the family together.

Note one the therapist, her decision is what was best for her and her as a person. It is HER priority to be your advocate for what you WANT, not to impose her lifestyle on you."

dating_advice,fohxf5r,t3_g7jxqa,1587774510.0,"I mean, we’ve all been conditioned to accept men and their varying ways. For women it’s a sin to age. For men, just adds character. My only issue with the photo is the grooming. Your beard doesn’t have clean edges and your hair needs a trim (quarantine can do that). Brows could do with some shaping. The thing is, when you start to show those little signs, you have to make sure you also show signs of self care. Moisturizer, sunscreen. It can turn grey hair for used and debauched, to sophisticated and debonair. You gotta keep looking spiffy. My boyfriend went salt and pepper at 15. Genetics. He moisturizes his face, keeps his hair groomed, and upkeep things to look fresh and shiny. 

So long story short, it depends on if the signs of aging are indicating to us that you don’t take care of yourself, OR if they’re just pieces of character that can make you more charming."

askwomenadvice,fogmqji,t3_g7e4ca,1587754543.0,"I would control the setting. I would also let her know that while You want to have a relationship with her again, it’s all dependent on her sobriety. You need time To Confirm whether or not she’s sober. You know you cannot trust her to be a mother, or even a kind person if she’s under the influence or still letting the addiction rule her. 

Set up a meeting at a public place, set a time limit, eat, and keep topics light. If she tried to bring up anything tell her that you were very nervous coming to this meeting, but you wanted to have a relationship with her again. At the moment, talking about the past isn’t going to help that, not until you feel more familiar and secure with what’s going on with her and how you feel. Until then, you just want to talk about Normal things, find out what’s going on in her world, what she enjoys, how she’s coping with quarantine (another thing to consider when meeting her), and just talk about things outside of yourself. Have a conversation. 

If you want to do it again, schedule it then, and then reconfirm closer to that date. Do that a few times and you’ll be able to see if she’s grown and changed and is working towards her health and peace. If she’s not, you have to protect yourself and draw back.

BPD,fogl3dc,t1_fogj2h4,1587753951.0,"No, everyone has their individual experiences, it’s true. But the pattern of BPD relationships, experiences, has more repeats than it doesn’t. The relationships we have when we’re not on the up in our recovery follow the same story. Over and over again. BPD enjoys recreating trauma and enforcing the narrative of abandonment. We bring the same characters into our life, with different superficial traits and experiences. 

If you hate this subreddit then I’m not sure what to do or say. You either contribute meaningfully your own suggestions, let the OP sift through the responses to see the majority vote, and know you did your best with what you think is best.

OP has already come to the end of their tether. It takes a lot for us to come to the end of our tether with an FP/BF. We are obsessive and put ourselves out there with very little in return. The balance of probability and what OP HAS said, and they have actually said a lot, it would stand to reason this best friend was putting OP in the position where they felt needed and valued. That’s always nice, except sometimes people take advantage of that. 

Again, it really comes down to OP to decide what to do based on what THEY know of the event and their relationship. Not you or I."
depression,fogjv5h,t3_g74kk0,1587753490.0,"Hi Logan! Let me remind that in ONE MORE YEAR, or LESS, you will be a legal adult, able to go to your doctor and ask for help from them. Right now you can access therapy via the website 7cups, so please take advantage of that. But you have a blip of time in the span of your entire life where you can use whatever tools you can find online to get through this. Therapy will help you through the trauma of the betrayal from your girlfriend. I’d also suggest getting mad if you can slip the sadness into that other pocket of expression. I’m a big believer in integrating the shadow self. 

But you are almost an adult. Right now you can talk to the one parent who might be most likely to listen, and talk to them alone. That is most likely your mother. Tell her that once you are 18 you have the power to get the help you need, but until then it’s going to be a struggle for you. Since she refuses to listen or understand she is, as your guardian and parent, responsible for helping you. You are doing you best with very little help. Figure out what you WANT from her. And ask her for that. Perhaps you don’t want to hear “man-up” anymore. Because it makes you feel worse and powerless. Have a boundary with her and hopefully she can pass that along to your father. But tell her that depression is genetic, it’s supported by science and clear evidence by your family history. Tell her you DONT want to follow that path, and with or without her help, you’re going to figure it out. 

The repercussions in the end will be that when you are responsible for yourself as an adult, you will know that they neglected you and offered no help. That will damage the relationship. It will be real. And they will have to live with that. It’s their cross to bear. 

Until then please utilize online therapy resources."

News flash. If someone doesn’t make you feel special, it’s not love.

You don’t love him. You are addicted to the chaos of unrequited feelings and frenzy and drama because let’s face it. Until we’re recovered we aren’t interested in well adjusted healthy men. We want the ones that can’t give us what we need. But they stay with us. They tolerate us. They make us feel like MAYBE we are special if they are keeping us around, barely giving us what we need. Because if we weren’t worth it they’d leave right? But why would they leave when they don’t have to treat you right but get a free ride in the sheets when they want? You get validated they get their rocks off.

We fall for emotionally neglectful people because we are conditioned to repeat trauma and narratives. Look at your relationship and I bet money he’s been neglectful for ages, and you’ve let him know it’s okay to treat you that way because you’re still there.
