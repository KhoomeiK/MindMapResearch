AskReddit,fapjrkd,t3_ea803g,1576289188.0,"A cute little bong and decent grinder to actually catch the keif. Weed has really helped my existence this year. I only get some every couple of months.

shittyfoodporn,fampmli,t1_fakajv5,1576209555.0,"Taco salad is a lot healthier, my casserole is a fatty sodium bomb of deliciousness. I don't have a recipe though. I just quickly boil a pack of egg noodles extra al dente, drain,  than stir in a homemade nacho cheese sauce. You can use premade, I just love my cheeses and have a queso/nacho cheese blend usually sitting in the fridge all the time. It's just a rue with taco spice and various cheeses. So fill the bottom layer of casserole dish with cheesey noodles,  sprinkle shredded blend of cheeses over that. Layer cooked taco meat. I use a pound of cooked and drained ground beef. I remove the browned beef from the pan, leaving some fat behind to cook up some onions/garlic/tomato paste/crushed tomatoes with salt&pepp. Than put the meat back in with a splash of beef stock and my taco spice blend. My taco spice blend:chilli, onion, garlic, cumin, mustard and cayenne powders with smoked paprika and salt&pepp. You can buy the seasoning packets though. I let this simmer for few, as I make a side salad. Finally layer meat on noodles, than just cover that layer with crushed tortilla chips. I love the hint of lime ones.  Bake on 350Â° about 15mins, just to melt the cheeses and finish the noodles. Serve with side of pico/guac/sourcream/pickled jalapenos/black olives really whatever ya like. I don't have measurements at all sorry, perpetual eyeballer. I'm sure there are other recipes online with specifics."

depression,fajgyob,t3_e9hksr,1576137252.0,"Man, kinda? I feel like this is why I'm where I'm at in my depression. Teen years and my 20s had all the rough times with hospitalization, homelessness, and suicide attempts. I'm 31, doing okay in the sense I'm not quite actively suicidal. But I'm so isolated in the depression. Social anxiety. I'm addicted to staying in the luxury of a cozy safe home. Homelessness was real shitty. Hot showers always feel heavenly. Anyway, yeah. I didn't think I'd even exist this far. I see the few folks I ever had as friends, all successful in the American dream sense. Home, family, career, vacations. But they wanted it, life. I never wanted life till the past two years now, thanks to therapy and weed. But it's also just so, awkward. It's like our lifestyles don't match past a few times a year coffee dates. How do I catch up, I struggle with the mental issues still, most likely forever. I had therapy this year for the first time, it helped. But now I'm like constantly awkwardly existential. My life doesn't look like most around me, do I want that even? It's like depression is my life setting and I just need to adjust to it. Idk just my thoughts."

Terrible hormonal adolescent years with first hospitalizations and consisten meds. Than my 20s being the worst, like the depression evolved and I'm just coasting on copes till I cease existing.

Mostly it soothes my lower back pain, which greatly impacts my existing."
