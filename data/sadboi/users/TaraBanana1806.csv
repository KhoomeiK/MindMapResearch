You could always just leave all her stuff around (if you’re like me and can deal with mess that’s not in the bedroom and is other people’s shit) and wait till she cleans it up. She will probably not take long to realise that she needs to set aside extra 10-20 minutes per day cleaning. 

She was probably offended because she assumed since you’be got more time that you would help her out but if she never explicitly asked then she shouldn’t have that expectation. I don’t even rely on my family to clean after me"

I knew some kids who had 2 mums or 2 dads but never thought anything of it or cared and didn’t realise anyone else would give a fuck. I also didn’t really know about religion till high school. I guess I was super fucking sheltered... there wasn’t iPads and iPhones back then. I don’t know if they are fundamental facts . 

I also remember graduating high school (catholic school I went to for last 2 years because it was the only school that would accept my ass) and the valedictorian/dux was SO shocked when someone said “gay people are mentally ill, that’s why they’re attracted to same gender”.

It’s a mandatory rule and some athletes have said no, they refuse to vaccinate! Instead of the bosses saying okay cya then, they keep bargaining! And people on social media keep saying it’s against their human rights..... 
if you’re a nurse or even work/volunteer in a hospital you must have all your blood work taken beforehand and they check your immunity to every necessary vaccine. If you’re not completely up-to date (e.g. my hepatitis immunity was low so I’ve had two booster shots and then left the volunteer work but still worth it- also we found out I’ve never been vaccinated for chicken pox so that was interesting and I got that! ) then you can’t work/volunteer! If it’s a mandatory requirement for the job then either do it or don’t do the job! It’s literally a flu shot like it’s a tiny fucking jab and i know my doctor called me to tell me to come in and get it (I’m high risk for basically everything) because they’re running out.

I have had heart surgeries that were covered by tax dollars. When people complain about the tax going to healthcare system to treat other people - please remember you’re saving so many lives! Maybe try looking into other health plans because 1/7 of your paycheck for one insurance cover sounds like a lot if you’re still paying that much. However, I have seen many specialists that cost like $200-500 per appointment over here and that is AFTER insurance/Medicare rebates so I can’t imagine how expensive it would be in the US! I guess I’m glad my shit-but-still-pumping heart was born here because there’s no way my parents could’ve paid $200K for one surgery, let alone 3 and the countless times I’ve stayed in hospital for weeks for pancreatitis/pneumonia/respiratory issues.

However I was told that in Australia we (our taxes) will be paying this off for around 20 years.

Seriously. It never ends well unless you’re all on the same page.. the exact same page! 
Comparing trumps election to 9/11 is hideous and insensitive. Obviously her disdain for the current president could have been worded better, i for one, would have ended the conversation probably even before that. I don’t know much about American politics and reading all that just made me more grateful (even though I don’t particularly love our PM) to be in Australia rn. Although I had to laugh at “why not just print more money” hahah come on, how did you respond to THAT? This pandemic has literally thrust countries into major debt and it’s going to take a long time to not only go back to the level of economic efficacy we were at but also to recover financially (for individuals, businesses, governments etc). So maybe just send her an article about that or how women in power can find themselves in a double bind, particularly if they are of colour and/or have ideologies/policies/beliefs that go against the majority of their population or people they interact with. Sorry if that doesn’t make sense but I have no idea who any of these people are except obviously trump and Biden. 
On a side note, I can tell that you’re not against women/feminism so I like that. And kudos to your mum for working hard! Despite being white it couldn’t have been easy being a woman working back in those days in such a notable field.
