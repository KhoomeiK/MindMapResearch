The problem I have with each kid having a different baby daddy is that it puts them at risk of abuse as research shows homes with stepfathers are most common for maltreatment. There are great stepfathers out there but how many of them really care about their non biological child statistically speaking?

unpopularopinion,fpuj4bj,t3_gffh22,1588914246.0,"I thought this was a popular opinion and obvious but then I read the comments...I guess not.

Just because it’s something children do doesn’t make it okay. Kids eat dirt, you’re not gonna let them keep doing it. As adults we need to educate our kids that it is not okay. If a girl does not like the teasing, as an adult you need to tell the boy to stop and (vice versa for genders). Whether he has a crush or not. Instead of telling the girl “oh he just likes you”, tell him there are other ways to interact with his crush. 

It perpetrates the idea that girls are just being too sensitive if they complain. Then we grow up afraid to complain about harassment because “maybe I’m just overreacting”. After being drilled into our heads that we should accept these “teasing” even though we don’t like it, people say “Why didn’t she say anything”. Sometimes it’s just straight up bullying but gets dismissed because “maybe he likes you”. Even if he does, if she doesn’t like it then it needs to stop. I’ve been looking into some crimes with domestic violence and most of the time there has been reports filed previously and police never do anything until the person is dead because people see it as just a “couple’s quarrel”. It’s a small thing as children but I think this type of mentality manifest into something bigger."

It’s okay for healthcare workers to have fun, too. People want us to be serious all the time, that’s how you get burnt out. I will be serious when needed but when I walk out that patient room I will turn my emotions off. I see people saying “you can’t joke about that”. Dark humor helps people cope with bad situations."
DoesAnybodyElse,fottg58,t3_g9g72x,1588065510.0,"Is anyone else sick of tiktok hate. Download it if u want to, don’t download it if you dont want to. I feel like every minute someone has the need to say they don’t use tiktok. No one cares if you do or do not."
BikiniBottomTwitter,fotsohw,t1_fots78p,1588064721.0,"I work on a COVID unit in upstate New York, we still get breaks and cooling time because this gear is extremely uncomfortable and hot. China doesn’t have labor laws like the U.S. and even before the pandemic they may be forced to work a 24 hour shift so we can’t compare ourselves with China. 
A tik tok is at most 60s. Patients will not die because nurses took one minute out of their break time. Especially during night shifts, where patients are sleeping, there is definitely one minute to spare. Though no tik tok have been made in our unit, If someone decide to make one, our unit will be fine and will not crumble."

TrueOffMyChest,fotfedx,t3_g907hx,1588052338.0,"There’s a graduation stole for being a minority and my friend asked if I applied for it and I said “why would I apply for that? What did I achieve? Being not white?”  But I will gladly wear my magna cum laude cord because I earned my GPA. 

Things like “girl power” and “black magic” I feel take away from the individual’s achievements and places it on their demographic. That’s just my opinion though."

Doctors use google too, but you need to know how to filter out bullshit and find correct factual evidence. But antivax have a confirmation bias and don’t know how to google the correct information."
unpopularopinion,foqrdxe,t3_g8u7li,1587999438.0,Even Instagram/Twitter memes are doing this shit. “This part had me dying” “I laughed so hard” “I can’t stop laughing” “I laughed way more then I should have”. Being told it’s funny makes me not find it funny.
