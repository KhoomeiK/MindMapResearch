BPD,fi3skxj,t3_f5jod8,1582126765.0,"DAE insert themselves in the aggressor’s shoes of other people’s situations? For example, if I read about ones story about how controlling and awful their ex was I put myself in the ex’s shoes and feel like shit for being an awful person, even though in my last relationship I was being gaslighted and emotionally controlled. Another example of this is while watching a video about a youtuber’s misconduct I’d have a vague feeling that i was as horrible as this person, even though I’ve done nothing in my life close to what this person had done. DAE demonize themselves like this?"
