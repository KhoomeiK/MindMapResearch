I guess you could say that if it's not hurting anybody then he should be obligated to bake the cake, but he should still be allowed a bit of freedom over what he bakes cakes in celebration of. 

I guess if we're just talking about weddings then you could say if it's a non illegal celebration of the union between consenting adults then he should be obligated to bake a cake.

>Every time i’m alone in my thoughts I either think about how weird everything is or about how I don’t know what i’m supposed to be thinking about.

Dude I had the same exact problem. The biggest advice I can give is to not give a fuck about how you feel. Overthinking and constantly examining yourself is what causes the dpdr because you're exhausting and stressing out your mind. Wake up in the morning and tell yourself ""this is how I'm gonna feel today"" and move on. Easier said than done lol.

When you finally do overcome it you'll know it. Because the overthinking and mental exhaustion will be gone.

I'm not a therapist I'm just repeating the shit that other people told me and the advice helped me a lot."

I know that sounds extremely cheesy but it's true. I look at life differently. Don't let that worry you lol. I just mean that I appreciate what I have a lot more and I don't take for granted being ""normal."" It's hard to explain. But yeah I feel real again. 

The dpdr will probably come back in some form because usually it gets triggered by having a really bad panic attack. I have pretty much overcome it though because I don't see it as a bad thing. So even if I go through it again it won't bother me that much. That's how I made it go away. I stopped letting it bother me. That might be hard to believe but it's the only way. Anyone who has overcome it will give you this advice. That's how I made it out. This advice came from countless people who have overcome it. Right now in your state of mind, ur probably thinking that never being 100% cured of it is a bad thing, but once you overcome it you won't see it that way. It's just your thoughts lying.

Being only 90% cured of dpdr doesn't mean you can't also be happy and fearless. Remember that.

It's hard to learn, but you need to always remember that everything you're worried about is based on irrational thoughts, not life. The dpdr is not something to be scared of. It's something your body does to protect you from past trauma. It's a harmless and uncomfortable mistake your body makes. I get it. I really do. I suffer from really bad anxiety and the occasional panic attack. I'm still learning to not be afraid and it's extremely hard. This has been the hardest thing I've ever been through. Telling myself ""I feel this way because of irrational thoughts, not because of life"" is the only thing that gets me through. 

Sorry for the long answer. But anyways yeah, I feel sane again lol. When that wall lifts up and you ""enter reality"" again even if it's only for a moment, it's the best feeling in the world. Those rare moments were the only thing that got me through. It helps to try to find something to connect with. I tried walking, drawing, splashing cold water on my face, and exercising, but none of those snapped me out of it. I couldn't connect with the world. Obviously lol, it's cuz I had dpdr. The only ""relief"" I got was when I watched youtube because I felt a small bit of connection to the real world again. People who don't understand dpdr probably think I sound crazy lol. I plan on going to therapy for my stress and I am staying hopeful. Stress is what usually causes it. So if you suffer from anxiety you should probably work on fixing that and then the dpdr should hopefully go away."

The Hebrew texts in the Old Testament are pretty clear that men who have sex together are an abomination and deserve to be stoned to death. We know that this is a moral crime and not just a ceremonial one because Paul also repeats again in the New Testament that homosexuality is morally wrong, which isn't a surpirse because any form of sex outside of a heterosexual marriage is considered fornication and morally wrong.

Lol ik it sounds like I'm contradicting myself, but when you have a straight guy who willingly has sex with men, and a gay guy who has sex with women because he's closeted, that's a big difference. Sexuality isn't determined by sex life, but sex life is a strong indicator."

exchristian,fnqqbsc,t1_fnq6hsd,1587169901.0,"They forget so easily that they used to say you were so godly and that you had so much faith. They forget all the times they reassured your doubts by saying ""Do not worry about your soul. I see the evidence in your life that you're truly saved."" I relate. 

It blows my mind that they believe even during those years of faith we would've wound up in Hell for not ""truly believing."" 

They say that salvation is so incredibly easy to obtain, but apparently it is not because God didn't accept our ""weak faith,"" even though we believed with our entire fucking soul."
exchristian,fnqh707,t1_fnqgrma,1587164533.0,"The main problem is I'm homeschooled, and my only form of socialization is Church. I could go to a public school if I wanted to but that terrifies me because I haven't been in school since 5th grade. The only friends I have are Christians, and I enjoy hanging out with them even if some of them have toxic beliefs. My Church is not a healthy place for me to be spending time at, but I don't realy have any other options. Plus I'm scared to disappoint all of my friends and acquaintances if I were to tell them I can't continue believing in the Bible and going to Church. I'll definitely read those links."

exchristian,fnqgqbe,t1_fnqgkvs,1587164270.0,"It's hard to let go because I've been brainwashed into believing that I need him and that he loves me. Obviously I don't believe he is real, but you get what I mean."
exchristian,fnqdmv6,t1_fnq9bhh,1587162546.0,"Man that's rough. I'm really grateful that I'm only 17 and haven't wasted my life away (no offense). I don't understand how people like you can recover after living so many years as a Christian. I got ""saved"" when I was twelve years old, and I was a super hardcore baptist for about 4 years. Even just those 4 years have scarred me a lot. I'm still involved in a really toxic church environment and I wish I could escape."
exchristian,fnprs0n,t3_g376dp,1587150809.0,"It is really offensive and kind of hurts my feelings when family members say that I never truly believed from the start, or that I left Christianity because I wanted to live a life of sin. It totally undermines everything I went through as a Christian, and how much I tried to have strong faith, and how much I prayed for God to keep me close to him. I cried to God on many occasions asking him to give me stronger faith and a stronger desire for him. I never wanted to become an atheist. I tried so hard to keep my faith. Christianity gave me hope and security, and I felt like I wasn't alone. I never in a million years would've wanted to stop believing. Obviously now that I'm an atheist I feel more free, but a part of me still misses Yahweh. I'm slowly recovering from being manipulated, abused, and brainwashed. It's extremely rude to say that we never truly believed. Because we did. And we held onto our faith with all of our strength for a very long time. 

But at the same time I understand why they believe this. It is the only way for their worldview to make sense. It takes away any shred of doubt that our deconversion might give them.

If the Bible is true, then I can't possibly understand why God let me go, or why he didn't hear me when I cried out to him begging for justification through the blood of Christ and when I confessed my faith in him as Lord and the only path to Heaven, something I could never deserve."

Imagine not wanting to treat a white guy cuz he's married to a black women, because interracial marriage makes you uncomfortable. That's bigotry."

gay_irl,fnowqgp,t1_fnov955,1587135051.0,"I think it's obvious when someone is naturally feminine, and when someone is being EXTRA. Feminine guys don't bother me cuz I know they can't always control the way they speak or move their hands. It's something you learn at an early age and then it just sticks with you forever. But there isn't a need for anyone to be literally strutting around every moment and screaming yas queen. I get it. It's fun to let loose and be like that, but it's annoying lol."
gay_irl,fnotfm3,t3_g2wx31,1587133252.0,"Fems triggered.


And it's not ridiculous to say straight acting. A majority of straight men are not fem queens. A lot more gay guys are. So it's not crazy to say someone acts like most straight men. Ur just triggered that not all gays fit into your little fem box."
gay_irl,fnosnb3,t3_g2md7d,1587132807.0,I just find anyone regardless pf gender and sexuality annoying when they act overly flamboyant and obnoxious. Like OMG YAAAS QUEEN SLAY BITCH. Throwing around all these crazy hand gestures. I mean not even a lot of women do some of the shit gay guys do.
LGBDropTheT,fnorc39,t1_fnlsyaj,1587132042.0,I think what they're saying is that your sexuality is not determined by who you have sex with. A guy can be a celibate virgin or even have a wife (obviously a woman who he is not attracted to) and still be gay. Sexuality is about attraction.
