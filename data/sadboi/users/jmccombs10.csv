mentalillness,fp7ftno,t1_fp7e963,1588369826.0,Good! I think deep down people like us have an amount of self hatred that‚Äôs only increased by comparisons to others. I think loving yourself and being accepting of your situation and of yourself helps a ton. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently trying to do. Doesn‚Äôt happen overnight but it‚Äôs possible
mentalillness,fp7ahh6,t3_gbjnvl,1588366985.0,"As a guy who recently ended my relationship with my gf, I was more jealous of things in her life than I thought I would be. That‚Äôs not why the relationship ended, but get what you‚Äôre saying with jealousy. When I was jealous, I would actively have to remind myself that I basically had nothing to do those parts of her life that I was jealous about. Being jealous only made the void in my heart deeper than it already was. I think that learning to be a little more independent emotionally helped me, because the jealously comes down to comparisons you‚Äôre making with her. And nobody deserves to make comparisons with other people, because everybody just has different circumstances and is dealt a different hand in life. I hope you find some solace."
