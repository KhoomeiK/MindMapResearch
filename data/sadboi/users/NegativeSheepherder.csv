Anxiety,fq2psis,t3_ggfhie,1589058452.0,Yes I had the same thing for a while during a period where I was extremely anxious. I have health anxiety so I thought it was something seriously wrong with me but as I got a little better it went away
Anxiety,fpu1h6f,t1_fpu0kri,1588902646.0,"He is in his late 60's and is generally very healthy/in good shape. A decent portion of the hospital stay wasn't on the ventilator, but that really does a number on you and it takes a long time before they can discharge you after you've been on it for a while. It takes a couple of tries to get someone off a ventilator, and even when that's done there's a long process of coming out of sedation and building up the physical strength to leave the hospital. It's also worth noting that his wife of the same age also had covid-19 but a much milder case, like no worse than a moderate cold."

Anxiety,fptq8f3,t3_fj2y1a,1588896079.0,"My uncle who had a really severe case of Covid-19 made it home today! He was in the hospital for over a month, on a ventilator for around 2 weeks, but after a really sudden improvement he was able to get off the ventilator and oxygen support! He was in rehab for around a week and a half just to build up his physical strength but he’s doing extraordinarily well now - he looked surprisingly good for someone who went through what he did. Today my extended family threw a little car parade to welcome him home, blasting his favorite songs from the stereo and driving by with signs. It really was a miraculous recovery and we’re all so glad to have him home"
Anxiety,fpmzur9,t3_fnz5n3,1588746109.0,"Today was a pretty rough day for me, not because anything specific happened but just like built up anxiety and anger and grief. I feel like so much was taken away from me so suddenly. I’m a senior in college and I left for spring break not realizing that I’d never come back and would never get to say goodbye to most of my friends there. My graduation was cancelled. I was accepted to grad school at Columbia University but I had to turn it down because it would be online and it wouldn’t really work for my program. I have no job prospects since the economy crashed and journalism jobs are probably gonna be some of the first to go. I’ve never been in a relationship and that’s not going to happen anymore.

On top of that I found a few activities that help me somewhat - language learning and reading - but I have zoom classes and a really crushing workload so I don’t even have time to do things to relax a little. My grades are going down the toilet bc of my mental health and now I have to reapply to grad school since Columbia isn’t allowing deferrals.

And then the anxiety kicks in. I’ve had really bad anxiety for most of my life but since a bad run-in with ecstasy (one time!) gave me persistent vision and neurological issues I’ve been constantly on edge for the past year about my health. I was finally starting to get over it as I got back to school after Christmas but then this all started obviously. I keep freaking out about the long term effects of the coronavirus since I keep seeing all of these horrible articles saying that you could have all sorts of terrifying permanent problems even after a mild case of it. I don’t know if I had it or not (I don’t think so since I haven’t had any of the major symptoms) but can’t know for sure and the thought of long term damage is so frightening to me. 

Plus all of this business about basically a multi year lockdown/“new normal” scares the shit out of me. It just seems like first it was “6 weeks of social distancing” then “6 months social distancing” then 12 months than 18 then five years. I even saw an article yesterday saying that the pandemic might never end and that there might be permanent social distancing and yearly 3-month lockdowns. 

I’m just so upset that this could be what the rest of my life looks like and my 20’s are completely ruined. I think about suicide sometimes but I’m scared of dying but honestly I’m not sure if any of this “new normal” is worth living for. I just have this feeling that because the government in the US is so dysfunctional nothing will ever get better and there won’t even be an opportunity to emigrate since no international travel ever again. Ugh I’m so sorry for ranting I’m just really in a bad place and I needed to vent"

Drugs,ez85cuz,t1_ez84ft1,1567734596.0,I've been drinking but haven't smoked weed since that night actually. I was with some friends at an apartment and was there when my one friend bought it from a guy he knew. I'm not sure of the exact dose but I don't think it was really high (I originally thought it was half a gram but there's no way I did that much). I think it will likely go away since it's decreased somewhat in intensity but still kinda puzzled why it's staying on so long. Thanks for the advice!
politics,eyg20ra,t1_eyfjnaj,1567059729.0,"Idk about Spanish but in Germany there’s a growing number of people - mostly younger people and academics - using gender neutral plural forms. There’s no one standard way to do it though so some use the “Gendersternchen” (Student*innen instead of Studenten for both male and female students) and others use a capital I (StudentInnen). In the singular sometimes people use a slash or parentheses (ein/e Student/in or ein(e) Student(in)). In terms of pronunciation people tend to pause slightly before adding the feminine ending or just say it as the feminine plural (which imo isn’t gender neutral). 
The gender neutral language movement in German is relatively new so it’s still kind of finding it’s footing, but I have a feeling in the next few years there will be some sort of commonly accepted form"

askgaybros,etas9gv,t3_capa6u,1562627854.0,"I went off of Lexapro around New Year's after taking it for about 2.5 years. I didn't notice any sexual side effects until a few months after my doctor upped the dosage to 20 mg. It's been a couple months and I still have a really low libido and difficulty with erections (a urologist here in Germany prescribed me cialis to take daily about 2 weeks ago but I haven't noticed much of a difference). Seeing a different urologist in the States in about 2 more weeks. Anyone else have a similar experience / have any tips for bringing libido back up after getting off SSRI?

Edit: Should I ask about wellbutrin? I'm wary about getting back on medication but I heard it can help increase libido"
berlin,et9n2nw,t3_cajbk8,1562600857.0,I worked as a translator for this local history app called BerlinHistory - it's basically an interactive map with historic before/after photos and informational texts (they appear on the map as little point markers you can click on as you're walking around the city).

gaybros,et6x0dx,t1_et6n2em,1562520758.0,"Basically it says:

Walter Weiss is diagnosed with HIV, has a wild night out in the gay bars to cope and then comes out to his wife and son, who then want nothing to do with him.

This leads him to decide to make his own crystal meth, which he sells with his former Student Johannes Rothstern. The two of them develop a sexual relationship, but Walter is treating his HIV and is relieved that he won't pass on the virus to his partner.

They then go on vacation in the mobile home and after talking with other gay men Walter decides to have a coming out and the two of them start a self help group. Years later they receive an award for best adapted screenplay from the state of North-Rhine-Westphalia

Edit: I forgot to mention he takes his own meth and that's how he develops his romantic/sexual relation with Johannes"

askgaybros,ery3kzy,t3_c4l23j,1561399629.0,"I live in Berlin (only for a few more weeks actually then moving back to the US) but been to Barcelona as well. I haven't had too many hoe-cation type of experiences in either haha but the nightlife in Berlin is a lot of fun and super diverse (bars, clubs, concerts, etc.). 

Berlin is relatively inexpensive compared to say London or Paris, don't know how Barcelona compares though. Berlin also feels a lot less crowded than Barcelona because it sprawls a lot more and is much less densely populated. 

I will say I don't find the people here as unfriendly as is commonly assumed - in general people can be more reserved than in the US/Canada/Spain (and don't get me wrong there are some assholes here like anywhere else) but I've met some local guys here. I do speak German but most younger people here speak pretty good to excellent English. 

Also a lot to do besides nightlife of course. There are a ton of world class museums here (my personal faves are the German Historical Museum and the Nationalgalerie; Hamburger Bahnhof can either be really cool or unbearably pretentious depending on the exhibit). 

Barcelona is also a lot of fun though. It feels a lot more 'touristy' in places than Berlin but it's a beautiful city with some really stunning views and great food. If you decide on Barcelona hiking up Montjuïc is a lot of fun and there's a cool castle on the top."

""Natural Law tells us what is true in nature. And when we recognize nature — when we realize what is real and true — we can create a society in which the most people experience maximum happiness. When we honor Natural Law, we maintain the ability to recognize right and wrong, good and bad.

It seems to me that our society’s ignoring Natural Law has resulted in the loss of our ability to recognize reality. As a result, we have lost our ability to confidently judge what is healthy and what is not."""
