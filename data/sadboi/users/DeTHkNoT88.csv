depression,f0dm1j1,t1_f0aqvhq,1568555845.0,"Sounds like you are a busy person. Here is an idea, you could always do volunteer stuff. Like make some blankets and donate them to charities that work with homeless shelters or orphanages or disaster relief. You could also volunteer your time at some places. You know just to be an extra pair of hands to help out. Like for instance at an orphanage you could help out just by helping in the kitchen or just being there to help entertain kids. You could possibly even help out with your photography skills. 

Just an idea. As long as your bills are paid then  it could be something you might enjoy. I've known a few people who have done stuff like that and a couple who have done mission work and traveled to other countries to do the same thing. 

Also, I may not respond immediately but feel free to message me on here and I'll do my best to respond üòÅ"

It's hard to find the right friends but I've learned that more I went through the easier it got to finding out which were fake and which ones are real. As for the family part, family doesn't always mean blood relation. Family for me covers the people I care about the most. Hopefully life gets better once the dust settles from the divorce."

depression,eyux0n6,t1_eyuw3e0,1567474415.0,"Well you still have a lot to live for. You're only 17 and my advice is find something that you love doing like graphic design, networking or automotive. Anything really. Friends will come and go. The ones that decide to stay will show it. Same for girls. They will come and go and if it's meant to be you will just know. If it is at all possible take this girl out on a date, even if it's just simply hanging out at the mall 1 on 1. Let her know how you feel. As for your parents, just do your best to make it and move out. Just make sure you can afford it. 

I know all this is easier said then done but I'm just speaking from experience. I've had rough patches and still do at times but where I'm at now (except financially) is probably the best place I have been ever. I finally have friends that don't ignore me until they need something. I have a good job (although I wouldn't mind a new boss) and everyone around me sees me for who I am. If it helps put things in perspective I'm almost twice your age."

depression,exn6fzi,t3_ctq0s9,1566447353.0,My biggest problem was having sex. Things just didn't function right and the drive just wasn't there. Other then that I felt like I was just on autopilot which in my opinion made things worse.
depression,exn43jy,t3_ctqa2b,1566445813.0,"Every situation is different but speaking from my own experience, a really close friend of mine has been depressed to this point many times. The only thing I ever did for her was show up at her house or job with her favorite candy. I would just pop up and say ""here you go ok bye"" and just let it be. Sometimes it was an instant pick me, sometimes a day would go by but she would normally text me and just rant and get back to being ""normal"". 

All in all I say you should go see her and just be there. Don't make it seem like you're only there to cheer her up because that can be turned around to make it seem you're only there for yourself. Just be there and hang out even if it's in silence.

Again everyone and every situation is different. I hope this helps."

Check out fetlife.com its basically a adult Facebook for every type of fetish there is. Everything from plan MF vanilla sex to hardcore master and slave settings.

But you also have to consider how fast you get limp after cumming. If you stay hard for awhile then try it her way."

As far as drinking, everyone's different, for me it's always made it harder for me to get hard. Once I get hard though it's not so much a performance things as it a finishing thing. I tend to enjoy whatever is going though whether or not I finish. If I'm out of breath then I know something went right."

Reason I'm asking is because to me it sounds like he is nervous. When it's just you two who have been together for years, he is comfortable and able to relax. When you add her to the mix he might be getting just enough uncomfortable to cause this problem. 

Another question, are you guys always drinking when it comes to threesomes?"
