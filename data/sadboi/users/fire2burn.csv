If you rock up at any of the 3 private hospitals in your city showing signs of deterioration and respiratory distress they're going to call an ambulance and simply blue light you to the nearest NHS A&E."
CoronavirusUK,fix6qup,t1_fiwdng9,1582813991.0,"Our consultants have been banging on about the dire provision of ITU beds for years now but it has largely fallen on deaf ears, Jeremy Hunt didn't care and his successor doesn't either. The government see empty beds and spare equipment stocks as wastage rather than valuable investments for a rainy day. We have just 23 ITU/Critical Care beds to cover the entire adult population of Northamptonshire across 2 hospitals. We've been running pretty much at 100% capacity for the last 18 months with no let up last summer. Suffice to say seeing Matt Hancock on the tv lying and saying the NHS is well prepared does nothing but make my blood boil."
CoronavirusUK,fiw04cc,t1_fivwm77,1582772000.0,"Not yet announced by the UK authorities. Probably didn't want the media and other interested parties descending on the place before they have time to prepare i.e. cordoning off the school, transporting the patient from their house to hospital, etc."
CoronavirusUK,fivw670,t1_fivtyd0,1582769423.0,Good find also! It'll be interesting to follow this up later in the day and see if it gets officially confirmed.
unitedkingdom,fiven6g,t1_fitrffq,1582758972.0,We were talking about this at work today (I'm a nurse). It's unbelievable that even after the complete shit show on the diamond princess cruise ship countries still aren't enforcing proper quarantine and segregation protocols. These guests at the hotel need to be physically separated and isolated from each other!
CoronavirusUK,fifkr1n,t1_fifdrf3,1582390779.0,"It's not doctors and nurses in the NHS saying we're well prepared, it's some Whitehall noddy repeating a one liner they were told to regurgitate by the government in an attempt to avert panic and unease. Not a chance the health secretary Matt Hancock is going to let those in the NHS speak openly and candidly. Myself and the other nurses I work with know full well our hospital would be completely overwhelmed should a sustained outbreak occur in the UK."
CoronavirusUK,fhn2kfa,t3_f3s21o,1581721265.0,Absolutely not. At my hospital all elective surgeries are cancelled until April due to the severe bed shortage. All of our escalation areas are full and it's currently an average 14 hour wait in A&E for a bed to become available. Last Sunday we had 23 patients being nursed in the corridor outside A&E because we had nowhere to put them. The situation is already dangerous without an additional crisis being thrown into the mix.
unitedkingdom,fh7rx24,t1_fh7rlir,1581343040.0,Yes Thursday the 6th February. Days after he visited the pub on Saturday 1st February.
unitedkingdom,fh7rq2y,t3_f1qfx2,1581342886.0,"Nowhere in the article does it state he visited the pub after being diagnosed, you have edited the title in order to mislead people and pursue your own agenda. 

In the other [article from the Argus](https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/18221431.coronavirus-timeline-hove-mans-movements-diagnosis/) it states he wasn't diagnosed until the day after visiting the pub."
China_Flu,fh7iurd,t1_fh7fx5o,1581333988.0,Some people can't be reasoned with. Perhaps they're an antivaxxer or they simply do not believe the virus exists? My cousin keeps sharing nonsense on facebook that the UK patients are just crisis actors and that it's actually just an excuse by the government to restrict citizens rights.
Coronavirus,fh7hst3,t1_fh7fjna,1581332546.0,"They're not allowed to tell you anything because it would likely be a violation of GDPR and patient confidentiality. In the UK we're not even permitted to tell a patients own family anything related to their medical care unless we have the individuals express permission, never mind disclosing information to the wider public. 

The hospitals treating these patients will have information governance clerks crawling all over. The punishment for staff that leak information (even accidentally) is severe. You're talking dismissal from your job and a likely being hauled before an NMC/GMC professional standards panel and possibly being struck off the register."
worldnews,fh0ilak,t1_fh06xmc,1581204211.0,"Even if it doesn't have a dramatically high death percentage it's the fact that large numbers of patients contracting it are requiring ICU input due to severe pneumonia that is the big worry. Here in the UK our healthcare systems are simply not geared up to provide that level of intensive care to so many people all at once. If we get a situation like China where hospitals are inundated with patients needing respiratory support then we're going to be in big trouble. I work in a hospital that has around 800 beds split across various different specialities, of those 800 beds only 18 of them are designated as ICU/HDU and these beds are already running at near 100% occupancy. We simply do not have the resources or capacity to deal with a mass influx of severely unwell pneumonia patients requiring things like intubation and advanced multi organ support."
unitedkingdom,fgputs7,t1_fgpgi19,1581012435.0,Bit late for that now. The article has since been updated to confirm that the patient did not catch the infection in China but elsewhere in Asia.
ukpolitics,fgoj8xr,t1_fgmv6ft,1580972021.0,"By shutting down direct routes you encourage people to take indirect routes. Rather than traveling from China to the UK they now travel China to Thailand, then Thailand to the UK. It makes it harder to track and you increase the numbers being exposed. People will also lie about their travel history and it's particularly problematic when you factor in dual nationals who may have more than one passport so you can't rely on passport stamps as an accurate record of travel if someone is lying."
worldnews,ffvh9yc,t3_ev7bq8,1580264082.0,"The whole northern Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Yunnan border area (Golden Triangle) is basically porous anyway it's riddled with corruption, smugglers and human trafficking gangs. If people want out of China trying to escape the quarantine they're going to have no issues finding criminal gangs happy to take their cash."
news,ffu6kpq,t1_ffu2cox,1580235565.0,"If you're young and healthy then the risk to you is probably minimal. If you're elderly or have existing medical conditions such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, etc then it's probably worth considering extra precautions to protect yourself."
worldnews,ffsxbzc,t1_ffsu9cv,1580196352.0,India is literally the worst place it could spread to. They can't even convince half their populace to use proper toilets and wash their hands. When I visited back in 2017 people would brazenly squat next to the road out in the open and shit right where people were walking.
unitedkingdom,fesjti4,t1_fes85kr,1579365952.0,It's a trade off. Previously when we had separate boxes and would have to sort waste into multiple different containers very few people engaged with it. Most residents in my area simply refused to recycle and would just cram everything into their black wheelie bins for landfill. The council recognised that the only practical way to get people to engage was to switch to a single collection system. You've got to be pragmatic with these sorts of things.
unitedkingdom,fes1icd,t3_eqf6eh,1579360480.0,"Here in Northampton I have one blue lid wheelie bin, all recyclables get mixed together (paper, glass, plastic, etc) and they just take it all away with no issues. I don't understand why other councils need to make it so difficult?"
unitedkingdom,ferz25f,t1_fer21ct,1579359835.0,"This I can confirm, it was frosty last night and I had the window in my study open because even with the heating off it was a toasty 23C."
britishproblems,fecam9l,t3_eo3cft,1578969663.0,They need to shake the format up a little and refresh it. Perhaps a celebrity edition featuring infamous German cannibal Armin Meiwes. Come dine on me.
GardeningUK,fe6gmd1,t1_fdxthh2,1578890292.0,"Get rid of the waste, are you mad!? Chip it and dump it around the garden. Excellent weed suppressant and helps to build your soil structure."
CasualUK,fds705s,t3_emgpwq,1578695777.0,My girlfriend says thanks for keeping her company in business. As an archaeology contractor much their work is builders finding random bones in the ground. Police then contact them to verify whether its human and whether it's modern or ancient. A few months ago a police officer left a bag of soil and bones on her desk that the builders had haphazardly shovelled into an old potato sack. I asked her if it was King Edward and she punched me in the ribs for making a terrible joke.
