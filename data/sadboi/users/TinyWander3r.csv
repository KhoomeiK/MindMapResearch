AskReddit,f2zi270,t1_f2z2kh8,1570523046.0,"I dated a guy in my final year of high school that did this. I broke up with him, and a day or two later messages me to tell me he's heart is too broken to carry on, he cant live with this pain, he's going to end it. I told him that it's unfair, because we weren't working, he was controlling, I wasn't happy, and it's unfair to manipulate me like this and guilt me into continuing this relationship. He flipped out and continued to threaten his suicide, so I blocked him. Next Monday, there he was at school, clearly risen from the dead."

My fiancé is the only one to survive with me, and has recently started studying BPD and ways to help me through it. Due to that, I've been pushing myself to be calmer for him and figured ""if I could act perfect in the beginning, why not just do that now too?"" Fake it til you make it!
