A lot of clients have diabetes or heart issues - it‚Äôs hard to get healthy food on a limited budget.  So healthy items are greatly appreciated.  And pet food is wonderful!  It will be a relief to our clients to not have to worry about feeding their pets for a while."

This is more of a grassroots effort to help our clients since our typical ways (food banks, etc.) are no longer as viable.  The comment below about donating to Food Bank of Central & Eastern NC would be my recommendation as well!  Most food banks get their food from that distributer.  they're great!"
relationships,fmh2gnt,t1_fmh184z,1586064620.0,"Some counties have mental health trained police officers that you can specifically request for situations like this.  In NC, they are called CIT (crisis intervention team) officers.  I‚Äôm a community mental health worker and I call this unit frequently.  They are calm and helpful, generally managing to get the person to leave voluntarily and peacefully.

This sounds like a horrible experience for both of you and your girlfriend desperately needs help right away.  It will scar her to have to leave her home; she won‚Äôt like it and she will be mad at you, at least initially.  However, if she gets the help she needs, she will be able to understand why you called and why she needs ongoing treatment.  Please call and get her the help she needs."

relationship_advice,f4t50tl,t3_dlprsx,1571784091.0,"Oh hon, you are absolutely right.  Your body and physical boundaries are your body and physical boundaries.  No one else‚Äôs.  No one gets to tell you that they are allowed to touch you whenever they want and you have to be okay with it.

Some people (and I don‚Äôt know if this guy and his mom fall into this category) believe that women should do whatever men say.  Women are supposed to be pretty and perfect and submissive and listen.  So, you setting boundaries means that he can‚Äôt have control and can no longer see you as a pretty object that he gets to do whatever he wants with.

Aside from that, his tactics are manipulative.  If you don‚Äôt do what he wants, he‚Äôll leave.  He‚Äôs hoping you‚Äôll just give in.  But I can promise you that if you, you‚Äôll be fighting this same battle in various forms the whole time you‚Äôre together.  Next time it will be that if you don‚Äôt want to go out when he does or have sex when he wants, he‚Äôll leave.  Don‚Äôt teach him that this tactic works on you.

Bottom line: you get to decide who touches you, on your terms, when you decide it‚Äôs okay."

I am posting here because we have gotten a lot of feedback from current clients that it‚Äôs difficult to find DBT therapists and groups.  Most DBT programs have year long waiting lists.  So, on the off chance that someone on Reddit was looking for DBT, I wanted to offer this as an option."

This is what we‚Äôre good at and we are adherent to the model of treatment so the therapy we provide is high quality.  That being said, we are offering sliding scale slots because we know that $75/week is cost prohibitive for many people."

bullcity,escmc1t,t1_escljwm,1561833090.0,"I appreciate the qualification that you‚Äôre not doubting it challenging!  These are my observations as a community mental health therapist working with this population for the past 6 years.  I‚Äôve worked with dozens of men and women who have lived at DRM and have slowly gleaned this information based on what I see when I go there, my interactions with the supervisors, and reports from clients.  All reports have been consistent and the information they give me is confirmed by DRM management.  I don‚Äôt have another source that I can reference - especially since I can‚Äôt break confidentiality of my clients.  I‚Äôd love to make changes to the status quo but my first priority in these situations is my client.  So I just can‚Äôt risk any punishment or negative consequences to them; this means that I focus on how to help my client change their status quo, figure out what they want in life, and help them find housing elsewhere.  I also have to maintain a relationship with DRM since so many of my clients wind up there.  I can‚Äôt afford to make DRM mad at me or I wouldn‚Äôt be able to help the people in my care."
bullcity,escir1w,t1_escdocd,1561830452.0,you are welcome!  I'm sure that the folks who live at the shelter would love to talk to you about it!
bullcity,escagot,t1_esbwfgn,1561824906.0,"Sure, some people are scamming; I totally believe that and see it!  And, many many people cycle in and out of shelters.  DRM normally puts people out for a set amount of time ‚Äî 7, 10, 30 days ‚Äî due to infractions.  And then people go back because they have no where else to go.  And the cycle starts again.  :/"
bullcity,esca1f0,t1_esbnz4k,1561824612.0,"They do not help people who do not live there.  The rescue mission does discriminate against LGBTQ.  They also do not really ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in mental health.  I am a community mental therapist and my clients who live at DRM often have to say that they are seeing a doctor in order to be able to meet with me because they would not be allowed to have session if the organization knew it was therapy.  Since I meet clients in the community, we often meet in my car around the corner because men ‚Äúare not allowed to fraternize with women.‚Äù  So driving away in my car is not okay.  Plus, there are no women there so everyone stares at my chest every time I arrive.  People who live there are also required to work 40 hours/week, attend church 3x/week, have to wake up at 4:30 am, can only take medications which are on the approved list, must memorize a scripture per week and report it to their ‚Äúmentor.‚Äù  They are only paid $25/WEEK for their 40 hours of work.  They are not allowed to leave campus for the first 7 days, not allowed to have a car, and not allowed to have an outside job for six months or so.  Also, DRM is considered ‚Äúpermanent faith based housing‚Äù so people who live there are not eligible for services otherwise available for people who are homeless.  I could go on and on but suffice to say that I‚Äôm not a fan of theirs."

Plus, people stay in relationships for a lot of reasons (desire to have a two parent home, financial needs, vows, stigma around divorce, etc) so I‚Äôm sure there are other reasons that people don‚Äôt leave."
BPD,er4n0yt,t1_eqt7igk,1560499403.0,"There‚Äôs a lot of stigma related to BPD and a lot of relief as well.  Once you get the diagnosis, it‚Äôs comforting to know that others are dealing with the same things and have had similar experiences.  And once you have insight into what‚Äôs going on, you‚Äôre better able to change it if you want to."
BPD,er4myvm,t1_eqtojqi,1560499319.0,"That makes sense to me!  Growing up in an invalidating environment teaches you to rely on others to tell you how you feel - so if someone else says that you need to apologize, a person with BPD may not trust their own instinct and will apologize even if it‚Äôs not warranted.  I‚Äôm glad you have a supportive sponsor who understands!!"
BPD,er4mw0b,t1_eqt2wss,1560499202.0,"Good for you!  You deserve to be happy and healthy!  And like OP was alluding to, I‚Äôd wonder if he actually accepts you or just knows what he can get away with.  
Just remember that the most dangerous time in an abusive relationship is when you leave!  It means that the abuser is losing power and they may freak out.  Please call a domestic violence hotline to get support on how to leave safely so you and your kids are protected.  (And domestic violence isn‚Äôt just physical!  It‚Äôs also verbal, emotional, financial, spiritual, and sexual.)"
BPD,er4mq24,t1_eqsi39s,1560498947.0,"Many of my clients tell me that they were never abused and had a perfectly normal childhood.  Then, they tell me about their childhood and it‚Äôs rife with abuse and neglect.  And so they wind up repeating maladaptive behaviors because they think it‚Äôs normal - they‚Äôve never been taught differently and so they simply don‚Äôt realize that these actions aren‚Äôt okay.  I know you weren‚Äôt doing it on purpose and it‚Äôs okay to take your time and be vulnerable and figure out what‚Äôs appropriate and what isn‚Äôt."
BPD,er4mle1,t1_eqswrm8,1560498749.0,"I have to spend a lot of time talking to my clients about professional stigma - especially in the medical community.  I hate that part of my job because I wish it wasn‚Äôt necessary.  People with BPD get a bad reputation, which is completely unfair :/"
BPD,eqsau25,t3_bzequr,1560280670.0,"As a therapist, I completely agree with this.  The vast majority of my clients with BPD (which is what I specialize in) have been in abusive relationships of all types. I think the fear of abandonment plays a big role in people with BPD not leaving a relationship.  And growing up in an invalidating environment means that clients often don‚Äôt know what is healthy and what is not healthy.  But they so often get accused of being manipulative - it makes it difficult to help clients realize what‚Äôs toxic and what‚Äôs normal."
