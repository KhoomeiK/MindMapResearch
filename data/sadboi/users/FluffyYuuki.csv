To be honest, I didn't think that message was serious. I thought I would joking reply to this supposed messaging bot, but now...

 *Attackers objective is to locate a bomb and defuse it.* 

I surveyed my surroundings. 

I spawned outside on the street with police cars scattered along the road. Just in front of myself lied a large tattered house with many wooden barricades with an X on the middle blocking doors and windows. I heard the sounds of shuffling and clicking behind me -- my teammates spawned behind me. They rushed towards the garage. 

Suddenly, gun fire erupted and a loud yelp rang.

Poor Ash main.

""Doc is peeking from tier 3!""

I dove behind a black SWAT van. My other teammates maneuvered towards the front door. One of them hooked on a rappel and climb towards the master bedroom of the house. I looked onward like a newbie figuring out what to do. My teammates beside me are shouting me to throw my utility on the hatch inside the main entrance hallway.

""What are you doing Thatcher? Clear the jammer on the hatch!""

I guess I'm playing support... again. I toss an EMP grenade on the hatch and the Hibana fires a set of X-Kairos. The hatch soon opened up and our IQ heads towards the stairs. I held an angle from the outside, watching the rotation from meeting hall. A firefight started in the basement. IQ was able to take out two defenders holding laundry closet and the connecting hall beside. However, a nitro cell exploded and the IQ was traded by a defender playing inside laundry. Unfortunately, that was defuser down in the open in the basement floor. I maneuvered inside the classroom, watching from the hatch. Hibana carefully threaded down the stairs. I gave the call that I was watching the rotation and Hibana mounted on the washing mashine and started the defuse plant. The Mute peeks from the corner and I was able to easily take care of the rotation.

Suddenly, my teammate was shouting on the radio, ""Interrogation! Run!""

*Your position has been compromised* flashed on the top of my HUD. Caveira took out the Jackal that disappeared earlier, roam clearing I assumed. Now, a Caveira and a Doc is out for blood, hoping to retake site and stop the defuser. Shots came from below and my last teammate was taken out. It was an MP5 sound--Doc is below and Caveira is above. With my position compromised, I took cover by the double doorway of meeting hall, still able to hear if the Doc goes to stop the defuser as well as catching Caveira coming down to flank.

*Bzzt... Bzzt*

Doc was starting to stop the defuser. I quickly peeked from the hatch and took off the head of the Doc. It's now a one versus one, but I have no intel on the Caveira's location. About 20 seconds left, so I moved towards the hatch to watch the defuser on site. However, a couple of pistol shots ranged as I dropped. Caveira's dead close behind me. I was dropped to 25 HP and I ducked inside the closet. 

I just need to hold for 10 more seconds. I heard a thud. She finally dropped. I aimed my sights towards the closet door. 

No time left.

*Bzzt. Bzzt.*

She's on the defuser. Does Caveira have enough time to stop it?

I peeked from the closet. It would've been an easy shot, but Caveira quickly turned and cleanly landed a headshot on me.

She went back to stopping the defuser.

It was such a close game. I guess I'll find out what happens when I lose

 *Mission successful, bomb defused.* 

Wait, what? We won? A wave of ecstasy comes over me and I was able to let out a sigh of relief. I then closed my eyes and soon blacked out."
