I‚Äôve tripped on 5g+ in my room alone with knifes and scissors around me and even picked them up and looked at them to say ‚Äúthis is a dangerous object and I know that‚Äù and set it back down just to test how logical I still can be.

Psychonaut,fckfixz,t1_fckc6u6,1577724184.0,"Idk bout other psychs but with shroomies you 100% can, just because it can happen to experienced users, doesn‚Äôt mean that it couldn‚Äôt be prevented.
Set and setting are important as fuck,
But even more important is you personally. Don‚Äôt take any substance you‚Äôre not fully 100% wanting to do. If you feel anxious or nervous (not excitement which is similar) about taking them, don‚Äôt take them and wait till you‚Äôre 100%. I‚Äôve had the anxiety feeling just overtake the first few hours of a trip before and it was awful. 
As well as don‚Äôt surround yourself with people you don‚Äôt fully trust or people who are indifferent about the fact that you‚Äôre tripping.
Even people you know you can trust sometimes you shouldn‚Äôt be around too tbh.
But most importantly, careful taking these guys hoping to resolve personal issues. It will almost indefinitely get emotional and those emotions can override a trip and cause it to be bad. (I personally love tackling my personal issues on these guys because I can be brutally honest with how I feel cause the emotions are right there and can‚Äôt be suppressed or hidden) any unresolved issues though on shrooms almost always come out for me. first time I tripped my friend was going through a shoebox of his old graffiti tags, drawings, collages, etc. And I said ‚Äúman I don‚Äôt even have a box‚Äù in such a depressed tone and he could tell something was up, spent the next 10 min reassuring him I was fine but I was totally hiding some stuff when I said that(I was 17 years old but had nothing to show for my memories or any objects tied to the past, no family photos, no baby pictures, not a single photo or anything) but how he just stopped the situation instantly and asked if I was okay stopped any bad thoughts. I was very thankful to have a friend that cognizant of how I was feeling and cared enough to ask if I was okay. 

I think just being ready and having no serious baggage that might fuck you up whiles you‚Äôre on it is the most important things, as well as set & setting. (In terms of baggage I have a horrible past, abused till the age of 16-17ish, no family bond, only one friend I truly connect with, but like im okay with my past and how things have turned out. By baggage I mean shit you haven‚Äôt dealt with or have been suppressing)

And I'm glad you are thankful for her! That's pleasing to hear because I've always wondered (since I'm not an actual therapist i don't know anything yet) how many people go for help but don't actually make any progress. And it takes a fear off my mind to hear something like that. 

It's also nice to hear there's other people who have the desire to help or take care of people and its not just me:)

Psychonaut,fb5gapt,t1_fb5d4yv,1576527080.0,"The original point of the trip was to test out how strong 4.3g of this particular batch would be to see if I could handle it before upping to 8g (4g makes no sense anyway wtf was I thinking) inevitably my ass was handed to me in 20 minutes. I never went into a trip ever looking for answers to my career path. I went in to trips usually looking to learn knowledge about myself and assess current relationships/things that were happening in my life, but this particular trip was solely to test out potency. 

Anyways I've known for a while all I've wanted to do is help people with whatever my career is whether it be building people houses or helping the homeless so I knew that much. As long as i help people I'm okay with it, but I recently realized before the trip I really enjoy talking to people. Especially one on one and I enjoy listening extremely as well. So with all this stored in the back of my head it came out kind of naturally. I could tell I was more emotionally aware than most people I knew and I was more cognizant of how people react to things. While tripping my brother put on a movie I knew my friend hated and I said to myself in my head, in about 10 seconds he's going to get pissed that this movie was put on. And sure enough 10 seconds later he got up and stormed off sayin ""fuck this""
So I could tell I was more intellectually aware than my peers and more understanding of peoples emotions. I don't think I'm an intellectual genius or god, far from it. But I'm just more aware of other peoples feelings and mindsets. So during the whole trip I was assessing how people were feeling and reacting to me during my bad trip whiles trying to save myself from the bad trip. I could tell nobody else really cared cause they were drinking, but I was trying not to freak out my friend on mushrooms on a very similar dose cause 2 people on shrooms freaking wouldn't be any fun. But it was the moment I went upstairs and was alone for just a second that everything fell into place. (Hilarious to me because recently I wrote a quote saying ""nothing falls into place, you just pick up the pieces and put them into place"") The second I was alone the first thought just popped out of my mouth almost instinctively ""I'm a therapist.""

I realized how much I was trying to care for everyone and make everyone have a good time whiles I was the one ultimately having the worst time. Even in a state of total mental chaos and hallucinations at my core, all I wanted was to care for the others and solve all the problems, while ending the bad trip of course. Once I was undressed in the shower dancing and singing ensued ""I'm a therapist, ahhhh, I'm a therapist ahhh"" it went on for about 10-20 mins in the shower before I got out feeling absolutely relieved and slightly embarrassed about what I had been saying. Got dressed and returned downstairs to tell everyone that I was a therapist. I told everyone, they all laughed at me and thought it was hilarious. And I didn't feel judged because I knew it was a ludicrous though. 

Anyways the evening ended eventually and the next day arrived and all I could think was ""I'm a therapist?"".
Passed it off as nothing and thought it was just a funny thing I was saying during the trip. But over the next few days I realized like no this is what I actually want to fucking do. I had an interest in psychology for a long ass time as well, it was my favorite subject. I was reluctant to tell anyone how I felt because to them it was just a shroomed up thought and was baseless, but to me it was who I was and wanted to be. So I spent the next few weeks looking into jobs related to psychology and I became absolutely certain that a counselling psychologist is what I want/need to be. It's me, who I am. I'm only 19 but I am deadset I know this is who I am. It's not a coincidence I blurted out those words without even thinking. 

I never went searching for my career path during the trip, it was a trip solely to test shroom potency to see how strong it was and watch movies and be giggly with friends. It catapulted me into horrifying hallucinations, after I got past that I was deeply unsettled but feeling better, I was still major mindfucked surrounded by drunk people. But i don't know, the moment I was alone in my room/bathroom, things fell into place. I realized who I was and what I am and stopped trying to fight it. I love people and I'm a helper, this is what I am and what I'll do. And I'm fortunate to be smart enough to be able to get the grades to go for a masters/doctorate, (PsyD). I don't know, it just happened, without me even looking for it. It could've been destiny or pure luck that the thought popped out of my mouth, it wasn't even something I was thinking it just came out randomly. To me it was fate. I've thought about going into trips and thinking about what I wanted to do for a career but I never actually have. I considered it a waste of time cause I'd never be sure if it was just drugs or what I really wanted to do. But this just happened, no searching for it, it just happened.

TL;DR - Took 4.3g to test potency, spiraled into bad trip with unsettling hallucinations, came back to my friends and tried to calm myself down, went into my bedroom alone and it just happened. It just all made sense. I'm a therapist."

I'm really empathetic and understanding towards other people and I've always had an innate feeling of love or desire to help people since my first shroom trip in 2017 which just made me appreciate human life more. I'm sure it'll be an extremely difficult path and far from easy, and incredibly long.

I was fucked, terrifying, surrounded by drunk friends gone off 7+ beers. Couldn't follow conversation cause they were drunk, just wanted to go upstairs and talk to my grandma but my brother wouldn't let me and kept me downstairs with all the drunk people. 

Didn't help they were occasionally talking about fucked stuff like car accidents and injuries. I could barely make out what they were saying but my subconcious kept picking it up and it was unsettling me deeply, I'd cry out ""please guys just stop talking about this stuff I know you guys don't mean to but its bothering me deeply"" and they'd apologize but end up talking about it like 5 mins later again. 

Only thing that saved me from 6+ hours of torture was after about 1hr-ish later when I let go of the thought of my friends helping me feel better cause they just wanted to hangout and weren't really interested in calming me down and telling me I was okay. I really wanted a hug so fucking bad the whole time but no one would when I'd ask, so I gave up and just forced a smile on my face cause I didn't know what else to do but remembered chemicals being released when you smile, 20 mins later the huge ass grin worked and I was feeling okay and laughing again. 
After that I went upstairs to my bedroom and accidentally pissed my self cause I didn't realize I had to pee. Took a shower, and during the shower realized finally what i wanted to for my career path. Applied to school and prepping for 8+ years of schooling to become a counselling psychologist. 

Terrifuckingfying trip, but arguably the best one ever. Also broke up with my girlfriend shortly after realizing our relationship had been stagnant for the last 6 months and we'd stopped growing as people with each other."

Psychonaut,f6vbgn3,t1_f6v7odh,1573181579.0,its my bad I should've fleshed out the post more and maybe given more of an idea of how many I've taken and my experience so far:/ <3
Psychonaut,f6v612p,t3_dt7wgz,1573177558.0,"Must‚Äôve been a moderate dose like 3-4g or something but my gf said earlier that day ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not making you do anything you don‚Äôt want to do.‚Äù 
Ended up thinking about that for hours in the second half of the trip and realized she was falling out of love with me cause I had been tripping every weekend in the month of August and sometimes on my days off midweek. Cut back on the shrooms heavily and adopted Terrence McKenna 2-3 trips a year on a high dose in silent darkness instead. She prefers this cause she worried about my excessive shroom use. we good now tho:)

Edit: definitely not as fun as my spiritual experiences but this trip had the most direct and visible effect."

Psychonaut,f6uwwyi,t1_f6uw2wd,1573170722.0,"I don‚Äôt have any friends good enough to sit me, but my older brother will be home if I need him I survived 6,5 alone too.

Edit: thank you though I will definitely be cautious and let my brother know. I think I‚Äôll be okay as well considering my 1st trip was 3.5g in the dark alone for 4hrs cause my friend went to bed on his shrooms and I thought I died on the beanbag chair I was sitting in, in a dark room absent of light. Also will be my 10th trip for a reference of how many experiences I‚Äôve had so far with shrooms."
Psychonaut,f6uvz5r,t1_f6unxuq,1573170051.0,"Most I‚Äôve done was 9g by accident and it was a horrible trip with anxiety like crazy induced by my older brother on his first time tripping. I think I can handle it I‚Äôm not sure tho, relatively speaking if it‚Äôs a good trip I should be okay considering I had 9g of anxiety filled horror for 12hrs cause I started 4g and redosed 5g after 2-3 hrs I don‚Äôt really remember.
9g wasn‚Äôt in silent darkness tho"
Psychonaut,f6uvkg4,t1_f6ugu9f,1573169766.0,"I have 17g total atm, I‚Äôve done both 5.5 and 6.5 before but the 6.5 felt infinitely better than the 5.5 but that may have just been because of what I seen:"
