Mattress,fox8732,t3_g5n7z3,1588136510.0,"I ordered mine on the 13 as well( a full size with frame, sheets, pillows and mattress), so far all I have received is the frame and the sheets tracking number stopped updating 5 days ago. No word on the mattress or pillows. No response to any emails and calls suck. I thought it would be here by the time I moved into my new place so I’ve been stuck sleeping on the floor..."

EatingDisorders,esub50s,t3_c90ab4,1562280742.0,"Help her find a therapist that she feels comfortable and safe with. No matter how many appointments that is, allow her to find that therapist. Finding a therapist is like finding the perfect pair of jeans. Let her know that she is loved and you are there for her, often. Reassurance is so helpful. Constant reminders and seeing that someone is concerned for her would help a bit. Try to see if you guys can go out and eat, but something healthy. If you expect her to eat a burger with you she will probably lose her shit, get upset, and obviously not eat that burger. Bring more healthy foods and snacks to the house to help her get a healthy relationship with food. If she’s surrounded by a lot of unhealthy and processed foods that she knows has a lot of calories she will not eat it. However if it’s healthy she may eat bits of it but please remember to be slow with her. Do not rush anything bc it may just make her feel worse. Please do not yell at her, be calm and try to be understanding. Go shopping with her maybe but only at a point you see her feeling a bit better and let her know that she looks okay. I am saying when she is better because the numbers and sizes are scary.  When it comes to food try to keep numbers off the table too. Also she probably does know that this isn’t healthy, but when you start to become anorexic nothing really matters. It’s so painful, you feel so alone, you never feel comfortable in your own body, you hate yourself, so much negativity it hurts so much. I’m still on and off and barely managing myself, but it’s so painful to see someone else struggling like me. I used to go to ediop and group therapy too and it helped. I’m stable now it’s just still difficult. I don’t want her to have permanent damage like me it just sucks.."
