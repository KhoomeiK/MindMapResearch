If you replace '\~Îßå' with '\~Ïù¥/Í∞Ä', it lessens the connotation of '""*only""* the design is pretty' in the sentence. But it doesn't get rid of it completely. The sentence remains negative compared to #2, similar to #3. Unlike #3, the first fact does not emphasize the second fact. The two facts remain separate, connected by the contrast '\~ÌïòÏßÄ/ÏßÄ'.

I would even venture to say that #4 sounds like a new sentence.

Korean,ffvhuhn,t3_evc4oh,1580264465.0,"Okay, let's use your example above. 

As you've mentioned '\~ÏßÄ' connects two contrasting statements. But there is a nuance between '\~ÏßÄ', '\~ÌïòÍ∏¥ ÌïòÏßÄÎßå', and '\~Ìïú Îç∞ÎèÑ' that makes them hard to use interchangeably. 

But all three sentences translate to ""This company's product has a pretty design but the product's quality is poor."" so let me go about this another way. 

1. ""Ïù¥ ÌöåÏÇ¨ Ï†úÌíàÏùÄ ÎîîÏûêÏù∏Îßå ÏòàÏÅò**ÏßÄ** ÏÑ±Îä•ÏùÄ Ï¢ãÏßÄ ÏïäÏïÑÏöî."" 

This is a negative sentence. As in it is nuanced in a very negative way. The speaker is saying that the only positive aspect about *this company's product* is its design. The accurate translation would be: ""The only good thing about this company's product is that it is pretty. Its quality is poor."". 

The two facts that are being contrasted can be separated. 

2. ""Ïù¥ ÌöåÏÇ¨ Ï†úÌíàÏùÄ ÎîîÏûêÏù∏Îßå ÏòàÏÅòÍ∏∞**Îäî ÌïòÏßÄÎßå** ÏÑ±Îä•ÏùÄ Ï¢ãÏßÄ ÏïäÏïÑÏöî.""

In this sentence, the two facts are weighed a little more equally. The first fact is used to introduce and contrast the second fact. ""Although this company's product is pretty, its quality is poor."" 

3. ""Ïù¥ ÌöåÏÇ¨ Ï†úÌíàÏùÄ ÎîîÏûêÏù∏**Ïù¥** Ïòà**ÏÅúÎç∞ÎèÑ** ÏÑ±Îä•ÏùÄ Ï¢ãÏßÄ ÏïäÏïÑÏöî."" 

This sentence is similar to sentence #2. The speaker is emphasizes the first fact to contrast with the second fact. ""Even though this company's product is pretty, its quality is poor."" 

Negativity meter:

1 > 3 > 2

The \~ÌïòÎã§ is normally used to show a state of a thing. Like ÌñâÎ≥µÌïòÎã§ (\~is happy) or ÌôîÎÇòÎã§ (\~is angry).

One day I come into work, the office is in an uproar because our two-story garage-type doors/gates to our loading dock was left open overnight, over a weekend. This was a big deal because my warehouse parked our trucks and vans in the enclosed area and I believe the keys were left inside the vehicle.

Anyway, as me and a couple of coworkers wound back the security footage, we saw two hookers and a couple of local homeless ducking in to claim territory. And around 2 AM we saw someone scaling the aforementioned two-story gates and land inside the loading dock area. The thief looked around, got in a van and apparently couldn't see well enough to find the keys. Fiddled around some more inside the van, tried to take some parts out of the van, failed, looked around to see if there was an opening into the building, failed, opened the gates, took two pallets (those wooden support things under stacks of items you see at Costco) and skedaddled. 

We had to call the cops on principle and the conversation went thus.

Cop: was there any property damage?

Me: He peed on the side of the building

Cop: was anything taken?

Me: 2 pallets

Cop: How much is that worth

Me: $3 each

Lucky for my warehouse but I feel like if I risked my neck to climb two-stories barehanded, alone, without help, I would have taken more than stacks of nailed wood.
