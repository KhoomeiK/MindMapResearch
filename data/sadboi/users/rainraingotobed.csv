Kevin Porter (of Gilmore Guys fame) raised money for the LA food bank by receiving stories about Ellen’s horrid behaviour. He’s previously found crappy stories about her antics on set etc and tweeted about them. Worth a read of the responses!"
bipolar,fo8jhhx,t1_fnxoih1,1587597761.0,That’s what mine was! You can do it!!
bipolar,fnxmlhj,t3_g4g2jb,1587341808.0,All the congrats! This is such a huge thing and I’m so happy for you. I recently tidied my room and can see the floor again!
homeland,flugzqc,t1_fltukri,1585502413.0,Same re: #1. That was a very intense visual “goodbye”
homeland,flugmj4,t1_flu9evk,1585502204.0,"100%. Wanted to get rid of that smarmy grin, the bastard"
shameless,fjz4ek8,t3_ffie9g,1583711133.0,I’m rewatching (again) and I keep thinking about this. I haven’t reached him in college yet but everything up to this just shows what a wiz he is. So sad to see his character go down the drain!

greysanatomy,fib2mh0,t1_fia9kek,1582313350.0,I honestly didn’t put the two and two together until recently when I realised just how much I’ve disliked the newer seasons.

bipolar,fgjedpy,t3_eyqkbs,1580842286.0,Absolutely always. Nightmare. Especially when it’s combined with my obsessive need to tap toes and fingers constantly along with the rhythm. And even worse when it’s some useless jingle that won’t. Go. Away!
