(The girl was also not in the wrong, actually).  I forced him to do it regardless of what his parents told him his cultural/religious beliefs should be regarding shaking the hand of a brown girl. Different beliefs can be dead wrong."

BPD,fpm85vj,t1_fpm7ehe,1588727529.0,"Well, I think using it (sex) as coping or as healing or as rewriting a narrative isn’t (all) bad.

BPD,fplen15,t3_gdvigh,1588711344.0,"The part that I find extraordinarily irritating about this (illness/disorder/adaptation) is that after years of therapy (some of it good quality), knowing the why doesn’t help all that much with fixing it. The treatments leading to knowledge and awareness of patterns and triggers, distress tolerance, etc are not really a solution either. Learning to cope in less destructive ways doesn’t delete that garbage from the hard drive.

PublicFreakout,fop3v1x,t1_fop2xai,1587952491.0,"Sensing there might be little experience here with how protests work at slaughterhouses, trucks arrive and approach gates, usually having to wait depending upon how many are arriving at a given time. Protests happen during this waiting time/ near the gate. Often, it is a time to bear witness to the animals bc the time to stop the process has passed. The animals are stamping, standing in inches of urine and feces, and very afraid. They haven’t had water or rest sometimes for days. There would be no urgency for a truck driver at this point to plow through the entry area like this. We recognize that this work of transportation and slaughter itself is not work of choice, highly stressful with high turnover."

Getting help, even with good insurance, is a marathon; or rather like back to back marathons. The mental health system and its processes - a literal labyrinth- takes years to navigate. That, in itself, can be a cause - or the proverbial straw- that leads to suicide. 
Some illnesses are themselves barriers to getting help by definition and nature of their symptoms. 
A large part of success around this will be getting the general public psycho educated."

Getting sidelined by injury in running is par for course but it seems there’s a point at which the body says I’ve had enough. Lots of people keep pushing past that point - past interventions, surgeries, etc. Everyone has to make their own physical and mental call. 
Hope you can make it to the next milestone."
