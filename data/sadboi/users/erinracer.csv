Protests happen during this waiting time/ near the gate. Often, it is a time to bear witness to the animals bc the time to stop the process has passed. The animals are stamping, standing in inches of urine and feces, and very afraid. They haven‚Äôt had water or rest sometimes for days. There would be no urgency for a truck driver at this point to plow through the entry area like this.

Getting help, even with good insurance, is a marathon; or rather like back to back marathons. The mental health system and its processes - a literal labyrinth- takes years to navigate. That, in itself, can be a cause - or the proverbial straw- that leads to suicide. 
Some illnesses are themselves barriers to getting help by definition and nature of their symptoms.
