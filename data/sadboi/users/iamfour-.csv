emetophobia,fhgenag,t3_ezlbf2,1581565177.0,"For me it has been 12 years now- the last time was when I was in about the first or second grade. I feel like it has made it a bit better for me because Iâ€™ve forgotten what It feels like (which is what I used to inevitably start thinking about whenever I felt n*) 
However it also makes me more scared because I keep thinking that since itâ€™s been 12 years surely it has to happen again soon and I donâ€™t know when which really terrifies me"
Anxiety,fhgbmze,t3_f2zn0l,1581563089.0,I go around my room in a circle kind of and I try to make t a nice part of my routine like before bed each day I put my headphones on listen to my favourite music and try to make it really enjoyable just making my space nice for myself

AskLesbians,fhfnz24,t1_fhf0pq1,1581547360.0,"I feel like a resonate a lot with this- both of my parents I know are fine with gay people and I donâ€™t want to have to say it so it becomes this big thing, like everything is going fine right now in our relationship. I do worry that when I tell my mum sheâ€™s going to feel like Iâ€™ve been lying to her or that thereâ€™s some whole other side to me when really I consider this only a tiny part of who I am. 
I also am dreading the awkwardness thatâ€™s going to follow telling them, especially my mum. I hope for you things get less awkward in the next few months and go back to normal!"

AskLesbians,fhfloqc,t1_fhe1a3m,1581545948.0,thatâ€™s definitely how I see it with my extended family because I donâ€™t have a very close relationship with them therefore I donâ€™t think itâ€™s their right to know until Iâ€™m actually in a relationship. Thanks for your response I appreciate it ðŸ˜‡
