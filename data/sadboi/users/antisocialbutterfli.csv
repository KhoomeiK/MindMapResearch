AskReddit,fm6surj,t3_fsy0kx,1585802283.0,I wanted to be friends with the ‚Äòpopular girl‚Äô so bad in third grade but she had her own best friend. I found a doll that resembled her and named my doll after her. I would ‚Äúhangout‚Äù with her as if it was the real girl. We‚Äôd have sleepovers and do fun girl stuff. I feel pathetic thinking back to it. Strange times!
relationships,flfe93z,t3_foewvj,1585104376.0,"He‚Äôs obviously still in love with his ex. I‚Äôm so sorry. This isn‚Äôt a girlfriend from a month or year ago, this has been SIX YEARS and he‚Äôs still just as hurt. He hasn‚Äôt let go of it. OP, you don‚Äôt deserve to be somebody‚Äôs backup plan. If his ex girlfriend asked him for a redo, he‚Äôd drop you like a hot potato. The first red flag is that he even still talks about his ex girlfriend as much as you‚Äôre describing but to want to send her a PHOTO to ‚Äúmake her jealous‚Äù. OP, use your head. Best wishes."
medical,fjj8x0g,t3_fdpoj1,1583386810.0,"I was in the same situation a couple months ago. Literally thought I was going to have to have it surgically removed. I sat on the toilet for two days. The hospital was not an option and I didn‚Äôt want to use an enema as it would be too painful to force something this big out of me. I completely understand! I tried stool softened, removing it myself, hot baths and I found the only thing that worked was lots of Miralax. Miralax does NOT make you have to poop, it softens everything up making it easier to come out. Take lots of Miralax, sit in a hot bath and push as hard as you can to get it out while in a hot bath. It will be painful but worth it. Good luck. I‚Äôm so sorry."
AmItheAsshole,fim50ak,t3_f8lblq,1582518330.0,"NTA. What I understood from it, your love won‚Äôt change. Okay, she‚Äôs bisexual, so what? You love her anyway, that‚Äôs great! I think it was a little bit of an inappropriate time for her to casually tell you while watching TV and expect a huge reaction out of it. Sounds like she was just looking for a reaction."
TLCUnexpected,fhd9ilj,t1_fhd33ot,1581480348.0,"Um I dunno... just strange to me. They hated each other and he disrespected her a lot (The Unexpected Tellall for example.) when him and Hailey 2 were together, they were enemies and had no social media connection. Now they like each other‚Äôs pictures (selfies) and she was shouting him out. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

AmItheAsshole,ffvf0nq,t3_ev1vxr,1580262583.0,I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre an asshole because you have good intentions but I think it would ruin his birthday party and he would feel embarrassed. I would wait until he tells you himself or there could end up being some resentment there.
AmItheAsshole,fecyok7,t3_eoeslw,1578990107.0,"Am I the only one that believes OP is NOT TA?
Everybody is hurt in this situation. Both women just lost somebody they love dearly. I think I can understand both sides.
OP wants the last part of her brother that is left on earth and SIL is heartbroken and has her mind in a difficult place right now.
Does anybody else believe that things happen for a reason? She‚Äôs carrying this child after losing her husband for a reason. This is the last left of him. 
I think you redditers are being a bit harsh..."
