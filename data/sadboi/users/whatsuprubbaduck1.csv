I dont mean never help a stranger , of course we should all offer a hand to those in need. However, feeling morally obliged and empathetic to a fault can harm us more than help the other person. Realise that they likley do have someone in their patch of the world to turn to, even just charities. It doesnt mean they will, but you know that there are other people willing to help them out there. It's okay to let go of a strangers problems when you have shown you care. To know any random cared about me in my darkest days actually really helped, even though I couldn't see that at the time. When I look back, I remember those who were there.
