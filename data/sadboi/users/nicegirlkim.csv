AskWomen,fbz18ji,t3_ef1v0w,1577232041.0,"I've battled with depression and social anxiety for my childhood years, not getting any help. After car accidents, rape, and abuse I finally started getting help and was put on the appropriate medications. When I became pregnant I was genuinely happy and excited to become a mother. It all came crashing down when I was 25 weeks pregnant and I was put into the hospital on account of premature labor. My depression and anxiety were through the roof and I thought I was going to die. My son was born at 26 weeks weighing 1 lb. and eleven oz. HE MADE IT!! 

Yet my mental health was at an all-time low. I was angry at my partner and family. I even resented my son. I would yell at my partner saying things like "" I don't want our bastard son!"" Just horrible things. I was in a very sad and angry state BUT with the help of therapy and being back on medication, I finally felt like I could handle things. My partner and I are no longer together but we co-parent nicely. I'm dearly in love with my son and he's happy and healthy. Don't ever give up."

Something that worked for me was doing the smallest acts of kindness. Picking up a piece of trash, challenging myself to smile at someone random. Any little tiny pick me up of serotonin for the brain. It's hard to get out of bed with depression/anxiety..
