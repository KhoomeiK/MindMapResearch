I play split screen with my 5 year old son and the first 2 weeks of play were amazing.  We didn't get a lot of wins, but we got a few and were learning the logistics of the game as well.  All of the sudden, we were getting absolutely destroyed, and facing people with building skills comparable to pro players.  We haven't had a win since.  I fully understand that you will not win all of the time, but when we get paired with players that are far superior to us, it becomes very frustrating.  This was a game that my son and I could bond over.  Now, neither of us want to play it at all.  Simply because every game is the same outcome.  It ends with us trying to defend ourselves, but we always end up being out built and killed by far superior players.  Or we get an achievement mid fight, and the award blocks our view of the players we are fighting(not as frequent but still aggravating).

45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.

OrthodoxChristianity,f3j6jf6,t1_f3iyapw,1570947740.0,"When you insist that you can spot a true believer and a non believer, that is pride.  You have no authority to do so.  When you claim to know the truth, without even being present for what happened 2000+ years ago, that is pride.  All you have to do is say you believe Jesus is the truth.   When you insist that you are right, and everyone is wrong, that is pride.  When you tell people they don't believe, even though they verbally admit that Jesus is their savior, that is pride."
Bible,f329qsu,t1_f31uo9g,1570598740.0,"Yes!  I absolutely do appreciate these words.  

Here is something you may like...

The universes you speak of are housed by space.  Space is a vacuum.  In order for a vacuum to exist, it must have an outside force to contain it.  Take a glass bottle for example, remove the oxygen and now you have a vacuum.  Space is said to be a near perfect vacuum.  Near perfect because there are planets that house oxygen, take Earth for example.  In order for a perfect vacuum to exist, all oxygen must be removed.  Point being, scientists' say that space is infinite in size and infinitely growing.  How can a near perfect vacuum be infinitely growing?  Isnt this a contradiction?  Or is there an end that we cannot see?  Much like the Bible, space and distance cannot be measured by man.  Does that mean it doesn't exist?  No.  Does it mean we have more to learn, absolutely..."
Bible,f31tmrd,t1_f31sqor,1570584468.0,I like the way you worded that.  Nicely put.
Bible,f31skzd,t1_f31sgmj,1570583657.0,"To be a recipient of the gift, you must accept it.  If you deny the gift, you cannot recieve it"
Bible,f31scig,t1_f31sa25,1570583469.0,Like those who admit with their mouth that Jesus is Lord and savior
Bible,f31s7km,t1_f31rssd,1570583362.0,In the past week you have condemned multiple people to hell.  That is not your place.  You do not know what God has in store for those sinners
Bible,f31ry43,t1_f31rssd,1570583160.0,Because you tell people to pray to the devil to find Jesus
Bible,f31dzg9,t1_f31bzu7,1570573318.0,"You contradict yourself quite frequently.  You say there is no hidden meaning in the bible, yet you tell people to pray to the devil to find Jesus.  Nowhere in the Bible does it tell you to pray to the devil.  Its actually the opposite.  You are told to resist the devil.  Somehow you have found a hidden message and preach it all the time.  

Pot, meet kettle...."

Bible,f2ucz0z,t1_f2ucy05,1570413363.0,Exactly
Bible,f2ucvw1,t1_f2uc8f3,1570413300.0,"I am his blood brother.  He does this to everyone.  Read through his posts and comments.  For some reason he believes that he is a true Christian and that everyone who challenges his beliefs are not.  For instance, he believes you must pray to the devil to find Jesus.  When you challenge this thought, you become a non believer in his eyes."
