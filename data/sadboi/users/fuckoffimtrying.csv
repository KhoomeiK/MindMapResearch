AnalogCommunity,fppurzv,t1_fpph8a6,1588809562.0,">Then on the other hand I see people (especially Leica users) sending their gear off for CLAs far too often than needed because some are under the assumption that cameras have to be serviced as soon as they change hands. I only get my cameras serviced if there is something faulty that I notice myself. In OP‚Äôs case, he definitely should send his camera in for a repair (and $270 is a great price considering it required replacement parts; I spent about that much on a CLA without replacement parts on a rangefinder and lens combo recently for example).

True. I may save up or sell it for parts. I was able to shoot three rolls by zone focusing, but it's just not the best shooting experience especially coming from a Pentax 67. I'll have to get some quotes for the repair."

Idk I think it‚Äôs a journey. For me, at times, I accept that I may never get better, but I just want my family to know that I tried one last time.

I also felt like I wasn't fit for college (I'm 21). I spent three years at a community college and transfered to a four year university, but I've honestly been miserable here. I now have realized that I am capable of more than I ever imagined, but I was living my family's dream and not mine. I feel pretty shitty too when I compare myself to my peers/old friends that have graduated from college already and/or are doing research. I'm here just doing the bare minimum all the time because I'm not passionate about school. I just realized that I felt bad because I thought that I was supposed to be like them, but I can never focus for long periods of time (I'm a procrastinator) and I'm not really fit for anything more than a bachelor's degree. I want to be a professional athlete or a coach for one at the very least. I've been practicing again and trying to be positive by 'speaking things into existence', but my sister puts me down everytime. So I can't listen to her anymore.

I've been very lucky to have supportive parents, but they told me they wouldn't help support me if I didn't go to college. Which I respect and understand, but college has made me miserable. I was the happiest when I was training and competing. During my first year of college, I still was competing and even turned pro in my sport at the end of my first year, but like I said in my original post, I started to doubt myself. I listened to my family's advice in taking the safe route for a 'stable future'. Which ironically has made me mentally unstable.

What do you dream of doing? And what can put a smile on your face? For me it's stuff like comic books, video games, stand up comedy, and competing."

Sports really got me through high school. I was never the best, but I always worked super hard to prove everyone wrong. It was always nice being the underdog. No one had expectations of me. Then I started college, and I didn't really care for it at first. After my first year in college, I started seeing the importance of education, and I quit pursuing a career as an athlete to focus on school. Then that's were my mental health went downhill, although I think the fact that I lost interest in being an athlete may have been an early sign of depression.

Nonetheless, I just started working out again. I decided that being an athlete or coach is what I want to do. I have the ability to get my masters of Ph.D., but that's what my parents want me to do. I don't want to do that. School drives me crazy. It's going to be a tough road back to fitness, but it's the only thing that puts a smile on my face even when I'm down.

Have you found something that puts a smile on your face? Or makes you happy even a little bit? Some other things that help me are comics, movies, video games, etc., And reminding myself to not care what others think. I live with a family member so when they see me not doing school work, I get anxious. But I just remind myself to try and not give a fuck because it makes me happy to indulge sometimes. Of course, I indulge too much sometimes lmao, but that's part of this life (hell)... To find a balance I guess.

I don't know your situation, but try to not blame everything on yourself. Dominant culture would lead a lot of us to believe that we are fully responsible for our lives, but a lot of things are set in place before we are born. We still have to have accountability, but try to be a little easier on yourself. I know it's easier said than done though because I'm the same way."
