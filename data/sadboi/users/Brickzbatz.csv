NMother

My oldest sister was diagnosed manic depressive schizophrenic; when I (the youngest) started manifesting symptoms of depression (and eventually, PTSD), she refused to let me seek help. I was in the guidance counselor's office at school every single day crying my eyes out, they sent notes home - hell, they even offered to get me help at no charge to us because they could tell, but nooooooo. Nmom  refused. Because it made her look bad to admit that another one of her kids was ""crazy"". Esp because of her bullshit (and abuse from her and members of her incestuous family).

She let me suffer, let me attempt suicide multiple times, punished me for being depressed (not playing that happy families bullshit), had my other siblings believing I was the one making *her* suffer, and I had to wait until I was 18 and had a say in my own health before I could get the help I needed. 

My Nex

He seriously needs therapy (this is before it hit me that he was yet another N POS in my life) and I'd try to get him to go - he'd told me some pretty harrowing things about how one of his older brothers had treated him growing up. He wouldn't, but he was more than happy to tell me what I needed  to do and that I needed therapy. He was more than happy to give his unqualified diagnoses and tell me that there was something wrong with me (esp when I would tell him things he didn't want to hear - when I'd started to see through him, for example).

&#x200B;

For narcs, it's always someone else who needs the help - esp when they are the reason that someone else needs help. I came to a conclusion a long time ago that not only are Ns aware of what they do to other people, they really don't care as long as they get their needs met and they don't care who or what they destroy. It really is all about them. Once I realized that, that helped me to walk away and not let myself be sucked back in. They're parasites, and like tics, should be burned off."

So, I agree - take your stuff sooner rather than later. The nparent will just take it and do whatever because ""you left it in their house"" and the epararent will just go along with it (like they did over their *children*).

That is one of the most enduring themes of my childhood - nothing that was mine was truly mine, even things I paid for myself with money I worked for myself. It was under their roof, it was theirs. Including my first car that I bought and paid for on my own - if nmom decided that whatever bs she and edad had to do was more important than my only form of transportation back-and-forth to work, school, or whatever else I had to do (which, of course it was - narc) I got used to being demanded my keys or them just taking the car, and I'm left wondering where the hell they took it. They didn't pay for a damn thing (maintenance, insurance, registration - all me), yet under their roof, so it was *theirs*.

The kicker was - they had their own car. ""But"" mine ""was newer"". Which still makes zero sense to me to this day."

Be strong, you have us here if no one else to talk/vent to. Resist their attempts to hoover you - remember what they said to you to make you go NC in the first place. Don't let them suck you back in.

You are NOT the bad guy. You know that now, but when you have doubts in the future or start to second-guess yourself (like we were all raised to do), remember. You walked away. You can walk away. If they want to wallow in their mire, let 'em. Don't get dragged back down with them."

Even before we know what is right and what is wrong, we know good touch from bad touch. Our bodies remember.

adultsurvivors,flq1nuq,t3_fq4ccc,1585375727.0,"One thing I've learned is that abusers do not love their victims. They are not capable of love. You are not a loved one to them, you are a thing/supply/host/substrate. They are parasites to be picked/burned off. 

It hurts to realize that someone you may have loved didn't really love you. They just saw you as prey and convenient. It's a sick game. It's insidious because even after you've walked away and distanced yourself, you are still left with the damage they did. You have to pick up the pieces they put on the floor.

This may sound harsh, but it needs to be said. Predators seek out people to manipulate and force attachments. They are not worth you, they know it, and they dedicate themselves to bringing you down to their levels. 

However, you know more now that what you want is NOT what that horrible person/experience was. You will realize that you deserve better than that was. You may stumble a few times, but don't beat yourself up. 

Love consists of giving and taking; however, the giving part should not consist of pain, suffering, and anguish, and the taking should not be the love and life force of the person you claim to cherish."

I still feel that way - though I survived an nMom and 2 nexes, among other wonderful people - to this day. I feel like I'm just living and interacting with others by my teeth. I do feel like an alien a great deal of the time and I still am suspicious of people who claim to love their children. I wait for that other shoe to drop, you know? So I can go blazing in to save a child from becoming the adult I've become - untrusting, insecure, yet heavily armored. 

My nMom is the reason I don't particularly like nor trust other women. I struggle with that all the time because I'd like to make friends with more women, but I get to a certain point and just think, ""all right, when are you going to hurt me just like she did"". Same with anyone showing interest in me at all, but esp romantically - ""okay, buddy - drop the act"". 

All I can do is keep working on it - I wasn't born this way and I didn't become this way overnight. Hard to do in those moments of self-doubt and feeling like an actual alien, I know but something about steps forwards and backwards."

You don't celebrate your birthdays. You don't make a big production of them. Fine. Lots of people are like that. And frankly, if that's the way you are, then that's it. 

Your wife who has supposedly known you for so long knows this. Yet she took it upon herself to try to force you to go along with something she would do.

That is not ""cute"". It is not ""sweet"". It is not ""loving"". Whatever else the Pollyannas in the rest of the comments would say about this. 

If you don't want a fuss, she should respect that and not. cause. a. fuss. She could have save herself an argument because she did not show you the consideration of letting you celebrate or not celebrate in your own way.

It doesn't matter what others think is ""normal"" and there's nothing wrong with you for not wanting a hullabaloo."

No - the assholes here are the people who are undermining you whether they intend to or not, whether they claim they're trying to help or not. You don't need to feel guilty at all for being upset with two people who are treating you like crap while pretending they're caring for you and your baby."

I have OCD - it is an anxiety disorder, which drives a lot of the behavior associated with it. We must control our environment so that whatever we're afraid will happen, doesn't. That's the reasoning behind it.

That said...

Too many people treat OCD like a joke (it certainly isn't) and were never actually diagnosed with it - they use it as an excuse to control other people and their spaces.

OCD is NEVER an excuse to put your hands on other people's possessions, interfere in their setups/decorations/systems of organizing/etc, mess with their kids/pets/habitats, nor make others miserable because \*you\* ""need"" things a certain way.

She needs to learn how to manage it better and esp in the context of sharing spaces with others. Employers and coworkers only have so much patience with the excuse, diagnosis or not. Privacy MUST be respected, OCD or not.

If she refuses to do that and she ends up fired, it's her own fault. She can't just expect everyone else to put up with her and not make an effort herself. She can explore options for working from home, she can talk to HR about ADA protections (though employers can be assholes about not allowing accommodations in my experience) if her OCD is interfering with her job to such an extent, etc."
