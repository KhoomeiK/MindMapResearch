SuicideWatch,fqjktzf,t1_fqjkohs,1589411374.0,Yess same I need a break so badly. I feel as though we all do it’s just too much going on and of course the world doesn’t care.😞
SuicideWatch,fqi0pah,t3_giju3t,1589387838.0,Same exact way I feel. I just wish I could escape and not have to have all this stress and problems that I’m dealing with on my back 24/7. I honestly hate this world so much. It’s just too much bull shxt
SuicideWatch,fqhvydc,t3_gif6rj,1589385543.0,Are you still with us?? 😞 please give an update Im Worried about you
SuicideWatch,fqfhpqo,t1_fqfhn74,1589325090.0,Right!! If you’re rich or have everything you want then that’s the only way
SuicideWatch,fqdyxxq,t1_fqdubty,1589298994.0,Yessss we are already living in hell!!!
SuicideWatch,fqdyo0a,t1_fqdyiqj,1589298863.0,It really does just waiting to escape. I don’t understand how somebody could be happy and love this world. That whole “life is beautiful “ and “ you can achieve anything you want” is such bs life is boring and miserable. It feels good to find others who think the same
SuicideWatch,fqdyhgs,t3_ghu6g8,1589298777.0,The reason why I’m so depressed and just so over this life all we do is work work work. I’m sick of this BS!! This is not a free country we must slave our life away for money and I’m tired of it
SuicideWatch,fqdyddc,t3_gicggo,1589298722.0,It really does feel like we just repeat the same thing over and over again it’s very draining. I hate it so much
SuicideWatch,fqdu5oy,t3_gi5dkh,1589296649.0,Wow that’s so sad I don’t know what I would do without my friends that I’m closed too. I feel so sorry for your lost 😞
lonely,fq8g8pg,t3_gh49rl,1589165503.0,Same it’s unfair I always get treated badly while others are happy in love or have good friendships.
SuicideWatch,fq8g6kr,t1_fq8fs75,1589165466.0,I felt this to my soul!! I hate that to kill yourself it will be painful and we don’t really know what’s to come after it’s very scary like we are just stuck
SuicideWatch,fq8g0c5,t3_gh8074,1589165354.0,I sooo feel this I always wonder too. I hate slaving for money everyday I feel as if I’m getting no where and I never will it’s so draining I understand now why people end their lives. Life is too much to handle they make everything so hard for us to survive in always tired too I just want to sleep through my life
SuicideWatch,fq7jt9t,t1_fq6sr25,1589147332.0,Yess soo true!!! I hate having to slave for money and we don’t get the choice either we must slave for it. I don’t understand why we have to do this it’s sooo pointless we can’t take it with us when we die. And it’s sad some people get paid less then others. It’s a terrible system there needs to be a new currency system where it doesn’t put so much pressure on people to make money just to live. I don’t think I can work forever either I hate it sooo much it’s hard to find people who think the same
SuicideWatch,fpveo3g,t1_fpv4pi4,1588943070.0,Yea I have a YouTube channel already and I make a little bit of money and I just got my PlayStation Recently so I might start a second channel soon and do it I just been slacking a lot lately lost a lot of motivation to even upload anything
SuicideWatch,fpthak7,t1_fptd3zk,1588891235.0,It’s not easy to keep it though I’ve had a lot of jobs where they have let me go
SuicideWatch,fpsf9a3,t3_gf8ald,1588872482.0,"Awww I’m so sorry. Breakups are sooo hard I’ve been through them I almost killed myself twice over two guys when they left me. Both of them irritate me now like I don’t even miss them and it’s funny because one of them keeps trying to come back. I even was about to write a suicide note when I was going through my breakups . How did you Fuck it up though? Did you think that you did something to cause this to happen?

In due time you will find somebody else or maybe you two will get back together if you guys could just talk things out. This is a bad time for someone to just break things off. You don’t deserve this and please don’t blame yourself for this. This is his doings. I’m sure you did a lot for him in this relationship so don’t be so hard on yourself and don’t kill yourself. You can message me if you would love to talk I’m a girl and I’m 23 years old . Just know you’re not alone♥️🙏🏾"
SuicideWatch,fpsdsfk,t3_gf8fyq,1588871770.0,Same here my anxiety is horrible and I’m always overthinking. I just got a position at my job that I was contracting for. But I know in due time I’ll just mess up and that they will fire me and let me go because I have horrible communication skills. Don’t be so hard on yourself though you’re not alone.
SuicideWatch,fpsdhwx,t3_gf8fgf,1588871632.0,Same for me too all I do is play video games that’s probably the only thing that I love. Maybe you could play video games and stream it onto a streaming site for income. That way you can do something that you live and may generate an income so that you don’t feel like you’re force to do something it’s out of love. This world sucks they force you and control you to do everything it’s not fun at all. This is why millions of people are under high stress because we are always working and never have time to rest and think.
SuicideWatch,fprv13m,t3_gewx4h,1588862576.0,I definitely feel you. I’m stuck inside my small apartment with my crazy drug and acholic brother. My mom I was just told has pneumonia and is sick. I definitely no longer want to live anymore either they say that life will get better. But when will it😞 just know you’re not alone I hope things get better for you soon🙏🏾
SuicideWatch,fpqlc3b,t3_gezgcx,1588825513.0,"Omg I hope you’re still here with us. Please message me if you need to talk to someone. I see that you have kids and that has got
To be a reason to live!! If you leave you’re not going to be there to experience life with them and be able to
Guide them through this hell. Please please don’t do it, you’re kids need you more then anything. You’re more then what you think of yourself don’t be so hard yourself. You didn’t fail at all, and you’re not a failure♥️ you’re kids love you and you’re family. Please give an update I’m worried about you you’re not alone ever in this. Please just still be here with us. Take it day by day you don’t have to kill yourself. You’re doing the best that you can do. Of course you’re not perfect nobody is. You’re more than enough!"
SuicideWatch,fpqki2d,t3_gewbiw,1588824939.0,I don’t know what to really say because I feel the same way as you. Especially being a burden. You just have to try to keep holding on I don’t want this to be your last post.
SuicideWatch,fpqiac6,t1_fpp13ml,1588823436.0,I felt this!!. Working is not fun at all work till we are 60 years old is highly depressing. I don’t think I’ll be able to make it
SuicideWatch,fpqetdr,t1_fpp0172,1588821185.0,"Exactly!! Like what’s the point anymore , most of my money has been wasted on bills and rent! That’s how they get you this world was designed to leave you broke. Unless you figure out how to invent something or you have good connections if not you’re screwed. I hate that and then it’s extremely hard to get help when you don’t have any money. It’s like a loop hole after another"
SuicideWatch,fpqel7e,t1_fpplogs,1588821040.0,"I’m going to look up Ted. That’s exactly how I see it as well, I’ve been saving too but I end up having to use it for bills. I can’t save my check because it’s not even enough. We were all taught this life. Money is always something that we will need to survive it’s insane I really wish there was a way to escape this enslavement"
SuicideWatch,fpp4qmz,t1_fpp40v5,1588795938.0,Right I’ve been thinking about moving to a different country. That’s my goal I have to get away
SuicideWatch,fpoh478,t3_gectrb,1588784397.0,That project that you have done could you share it? You could maybe even share it to YouTube or something. Don’t let your work go unnoticed it could I hope open doors for some good opportunities for you to create even more projects. You never know who you might touch or inspire with your art🙏🏾
SuicideWatch,fpogrnq,t1_fpognlb,1588784228.0,I have a job... you don’t understand where I’m coming from
SuicideWatch,fpoard0,t3_gemkdd,1588781314.0,No please don’t. I’m not sure how old you’re I’m 23 though.  What’s the reason for you to want to die? Is it due to your abusive parents or is there other things on top of that. I know life is horrible right now it’s hell everyday and believe me there is plenty of times where I just want to die as well but I don’t have the courage to do it. I just don’t think that now is the time for you to go. You can message me anytime. Please remeber that you’re never alone and I’m here for you🙏🏾
SuicideWatch,fpo877k,t3_gegu73,1588780060.0,"Hey, I’m sorry you’re going through this. But don’t be so hard on yourself. Life is hell and it isn’t easy no wonder why so many people are suffering and are homeless. You’re not the only one in this situation and you’re definitely not pathetic you’re human and you’re strong. I don’t know what tommrow May bring but I hope that you will still be here with us. I’m here for you if you need to talk I’m only 23 and I feel you’re pain.🙏🏾"
SuicideWatch,fpo5kyg,t3_geinfq,1588778768.0,That’s pretty much me right now all I play is video games as well. You can message me if you want to talk more about what’s going on I’m here for you🙏🏾
SuicideWatch,fpo44n0,t3_gejiel,1588778034.0,So true nobody really knows if someone’s life will get better or not. Sometimes we really just don’t have control over our life. Pretty much for me the only way I’ll see it getting better is when I have escaped from this world and what it has to offer then I’ll be at peace
SuicideWatch,fpo272v,t1_fpnvx0w,1588777039.0,Yesss!! Everything you said is so true!! All we are doing is slaving and making the CEO’s rich while we get paid little to nothing. All the hard work we do goes to them and their business and more money into their pockets. People don’t see this. They’re totally brainwashed this is why nothing is happening and we will forever be stuck this way. People are suffering and just trying to get by. Life was wayyy more easier back then everything was cheaper now everything is so dang expensive for no reason!!!
SuicideWatch,fpnrlle,t3_geivso,1588771058.0,Soo trueee I don’t really like the hot line either they don’t really help it’s always some generic script they give me . “ oh just go lay down” “ go do one of your hobbies” “go call a friend” . But on this site people genuinely care about you cause we all are going through the same mess. Stay strong ♥️
SuicideWatch,fpnrecq,t3_gefd3w,1588770928.0,"Wow I hope you’re safe right now, I feel so bad for you this has got to be very stressful right now. I’m sure there are a lot of people you have saved as well too. Think about those moments. Doctors are definitely super hero’s you’re one too. I seriously hope that at the end of all of this they will give you guys a break and more appreciation will be done. Maybe you could seek a therapist to talk about what you have been through. 

I wish I could give you a big hug right now. Please don’t go though you’re needed in this world. I’m here for you if you would like to talk. Remeber that this too shall pass and it’s only temporary stay safe and strong ♥️"
SuicideWatch,fpnqnse,t1_fpnikae,1588770448.0,So true!! It’s all about the image as well
SuicideWatch,fpnqb0l,t1_fpmmpbj,1588770209.0,Thank you for this♥️
death,fpnq8ak,t1_fpmp0l3,1588770158.0,I’m not going too. I just have to keep holding on
SuicideWatch,fpnq72g,t1_fpmtncb,1588770134.0,You’re so right!! We slave for the money.
SuicideWatch,fpnq37z,t1_fpn2swr,1588770062.0,Lmaoo
SuicideWatch,fpnq16m,t1_fpndtsb,1588770024.0,Thank you 🙏🏾
SuicideWatch,fpnpv53,t1_fpnk8rd,1588769908.0,Same I don’t think we will ever be free either especially the way the world is headed right now😞
SuicideWatch,fpmmkca,t1_fpmmd98,1588736422.0,"Right!! It’s just always going to be that way the rich get treated better while the poor get treated horribly. I just can’t wait till
The day I’m
Gone and never have to worry about “money” again. It’s going to be the best feeling ever no more worries and no more feeling like I’m controlled by the government. No more billion dollar companies just me at peace"
SuicideWatch,fpmmcjo,t3_gea1mw,1588736277.0,"I’ve had two therapists do the same to me too. But to be honest I didn’t really like them anyways because they didn’t really help me. You deserve better and a way more qualified therapist if you do decide to seek help. I do recommend looking for another therapist. 

You deserve to get help and to not be let go of♥️"
SuicideWatch,fpmlq7n,t1_fpmlihb,1588735875.0,Right!! It’s sad how famous people and top ceos can get paid millions but yet people who work just normal jobs don’t get paid as much. Why does it matter your job title how much you get paid. The world has to do better I believe we should get paid enough to survive but also enough to not have to wait till we are old to retire. We have done enough suffering. Work so much can’t even spend tome with family
SuicideWatch,fpml782,t1_fpmkzcb,1588735536.0,It’s sad man the world doesn’t care about the bills we must pay they give us these shitty paychecks that we can barely do anything with. It’s horrible if they want us to slave for this paper then give us more so that we can atleast live and not be in poverty and have to work multiple jobs. And that’s sad about the dogs thing they should leave and stop bothering you and your family
SuicideWatch,fpmktts,t1_fpmghzj,1588735299.0,So true! I’m tired of this money thing
SuicideWatch,fpmkmrl,t1_fpmjwld,1588735171.0,Same!! Sometimes I wish I just born a animal or something maybe even an object I’m tired of having these responsibilities and bills just in the back of my head that I have to pay and deal with forever it sucks. This is no way to be living
SuicideWatch,fpmkiwj,t1_fpmkdlk,1588735102.0,Same probably the biggest factor in why I’m so depressed and miserable. All of my stress comes from money and financial problems and having to work and work just to stay a float. I’m sick of this world
SuicideWatch,fpmjh7h,t1_fpmipat,1588734424.0,Same I wish I could escape this. Tired of it
SuicideWatch,fpmemlc,t1_fpmehi1,1588731400.0,Wow that does sound so freeing I honestly might just do it. It would definitely help me save because rent is another issue it’s too much money just to stay in a building. Why is rent so high. Smh
SuicideWatch,fpmedq8,t1_fpmea8n,1588731248.0,Same😞 I wish I could do something about it too. I hope eventually we can all come together and make a change! It shouldn’t be an priority to have to suffer to make money
SuicideWatch,fpmdovg,t1_fpmd3hc,1588730817.0,Yooo I’ve recently thought about just buying a van and just living in it! That would probably make me happier atleast I wouldn’t have to worry about rent. That would save me a lotta money. Sometimes life is just not all about appearances it’s just about being genuinely happy!
SuicideWatch,fpmbkdy,t1_fpmbczm,1588729540.0,Bro same here. Yesterday I kind of realized that I’ve given up at this point I’ll just have to continue to suffer and be miserable and slave for this paper till I’m 70 cause I’m sure by then the retirement age will have gone up. I might not even be able to retire who knows.! No money either all just goes to these bills that I’m force to pay
SuicideWatch,fpmav7e,t3_ge4tw1,1588729126.0,Yess everything you said hit me!! That’s exactly how I feel. The reason why we go to school is to keep us from Being creative. Why don’t they teach kids how to start their own business or important life skills like saving that green paper and emotional help many kids have depression why don’t they have classes to help with that. Nah everything is about getting that Job. They brainwash you to work and slave forever till you’re 65. Why can’t we retire before that. The paycheck we get is just enough to bring us right back for more they never pay us enough. Unless you’re some top employee or a famous person.

SuicideWatch,fpm9zmu,t1_fpm3qyn,1588728602.0,Facts!!! I can’t talk to my family about this because they tell me to just go find a better job or go be a bum. Why are people okay with slaving for a boss. Someone has control over your life and schedule you have to ask for time off. If money wasn’t in this world things would probably be better. Or if money wasn’t so hard to get.
SuicideWatch,fpm9sgh,t1_fpm5nm6,1588728484.0,"I’m
Happy too it’s sooo hard to find people like this. You should look up spirtual so on YouTube if you get the chance. He talks a lot about this and how the world is messed up and how we are controlled. I wish more people would wake up we could really change the world here. This is our world not the government!! We need to take back our power"
SuicideWatch,fpm9nh7,t1_fpm6api,1588728401.0,Yesss exactly!! Even water cost money lmao!!! Like water should be free but that cost paper. I feel so bad for the homeless people. Money is just in the way of everything.
SuicideWatch,fpm9hsp,t1_fpm7c7e,1588728308.0,It’s very corrupted it’s hard to get a job. You have to have so many years of experience and all these degrees. How can you have experience when nobody will give it to you. And how can you get the degrees when you’re broke. I agree jobs should should cut some slack.
SuicideWatch,fpm9d7y,t1_fpm81s7,1588728234.0,I will love to see this day but more people have got to wake up first before anything can be done. People are brainwashed since kindergarten.
SuicideWatch,fpm9a0a,t1_fpm8hus,1588728182.0,You’re the chosen one and woke! Something has got to be done about this. Why is green paper so important!! Why must we suffer if we don’t make a lot of it. Look at how they treat people who work in retail and fast food their income is bad but yet America and the world doesn’t care. Life should be about spending time with family not slaving for paper
SuicideWatch,fpm93qh,t1_fpm8xql,1588728078.0,That’s sad. College should be free. I don’t understand the need to make people pay to learn it’s ridiculous. That causes a lot of stress on people to have to worry about how they will pay some loan off.
SuicideWatch,fpm909p,t1_fpm8nas,1588728022.0,So beautifully said!!! And I too don’t hate money. But it’s just greed people rob and kill over money. It’s sad. Money should not be a thing that we all need just to survive and live. I just hope one day we can just live as one and not be so worried about some paper
SuicideWatch,fpm2pzj,t1_fpm2lyo,1588724356.0,Right it’s just sometimes when I express this people call  me or see this as being ungrateful or lazy perhaps. But it’s all just how I feel life really does blow that’s why I sleep mostly and getting High really does help
SuicideWatch,fpm0n57,t1_fpm01qv,1588723150.0,Sure I’d love too mesg me
SuicideWatch,fply8ux,t1_fplxgb6,1588721794.0,Food should be free. I mean come on we have to eat it should at-least be free in those countries. Everything is about money if you don’t have the paper you don’t get anything
SuicideWatch,fplstwu,t1_fplsrq9,1588718803.0,That’s just the way it is sadly
SuicideWatch,fplr6dw,t1_fplqs60,1588717905.0,I so can relate to this I’m only 23 and I’m scared that I’ll be working till I die. I had dreams of owning my own business but lately I’ve been so unmotivated and sad. I have to get that motivation back because I cannot spend my life working for someone else. I need to have my own schedule and my own rules. Working too has caused me to be lonely I can’t spend time with friends or family because I’m always slaving. I hope things get better for you🙏🏾🙏🏾
SuicideWatch,fplpw0l,t1_fplppa9,1588717210.0,"I love this🙏🏾 thank you for this I’m
Happy to hear you understand me. I’ve kind of come to conclusion that this will just be life. But there is still
Hope"
SuicideWatch,fplpmqo,t1_fplooj6,1588717072.0,That’s exactly what it is! They train you at a young age make you go to school and learn stuff you don’t really need and tell you to go to college so you can be on more debt and take out loans. College should be free by now you shouldn’t be paying to learn. Such bs
SuicideWatch,fplp7rw,t1_fplos2u,1588716854.0,I’ve realized this when I was about 17 or so I was working three jobs and that was my breaking point. I realized I was working too much and didn’t have enough time. All my time and energy was spent making another man rich( the boss) while I was making minimum wage. I wish people would wake up though and see what I’m seeing. If more people wake up then maybe a change could happen
SuicideWatch,fploy3x,t1_fploq9i,1588716707.0,Yess!!! I don’t understand it either. We are literally forced to work for money or else we will be out on the streets. Those people are brainwashed and by the time they realize it they will have gave their all to a company and they will be old and have wasted their time. Life shouldn’t be about gathering money all the tike 40 hours a week and only get the weekend off. It’s so painful
SuicideWatch,fplnxrn,t1_fplnkuk,1588716163.0,Yess I love people who are woke. I can’t talk to sleep people. They’re okay with slaving for some green paper. It’s just paper. We cannot take this with us when we die why are we slaving for it? Money is the root of all evil. People go crazy over some money. I think ima just save all of my money at this point and just start looking at other countries to live in that’s not so costly cause i seriously cannot do this anymore. I don’t want to waste my life working.
SuicideWatch,fpln6nw,t1_fplmpq4,1588715761.0,That’s another thing why are we paying for insurance and health bills. That honestly should be free they make us suffer but still make us pay to see a therapist and other health issues. It’s just crazy. We need a change
SuicideWatch,fplmuzv,t1_fplml4h,1588715588.0,So true thanks for this🙏🏾
SuicideWatch,fplmlb8,t1_fplm842,1588715445.0,Love this!! I think more people are waking up now and see what this life really is. People are out of work and have no money. This world is terrible
SuicideWatch,fplmcql,t1_fpllzjs,1588715319.0,Same here!! I’m 23 and I used to work 3 jobs at one point it was so draining. I too don’t want to bring someone into this world and make them suffer they didn’t ask for this. The only way I would do that is if things got easier to live or if I was more finically stable to support them. Also in this world it’s hard to get help and support your pretty much on your own.
SuicideWatch,fplm4zn,t1_fpllwp9,1588715205.0,It probably would be
SuicideWatch,fplm3g3,t1_fpllpd8,1588715183.0,"More money more problems. I don’t want to be rich. All I want is to be free I mean free from everything debt this society, being free from working for someone. I could do that but I’d be homeless so I’ll have to work I’m force to work."
SuicideWatch,fplltv8,t1_fpllffu,1588715042.0,"Yes!! Everything is about paper, we are controlled and we slave for paper. It’s funny and sad when you think about it. You cannot take this with you when you die so why make it so hard to live and to make money. I feel bad for the people who don’t have money but just want to make it in this money hungry world. It’s not fair at all"
SuicideWatch,fpllgnu,t1_fpll8x2,1588714849.0,Omg yesss!! You see what I see🙏🏾 I don’t understand how people are okay with this life. Like it makes no sense why are we Slaving for paper till we are dead. By the time we are 65 we will retire if lucky but why wait to be free why can’t we be free now. Everything shouldn’t be so expensive life shouldn’t be this hard it’s insane.
SuicideWatch,fplla2m,t3_ge54nb,1588714753.0,I feel you I got so frustrated earlier I tryed to call and get help too. But just got put down. It’s like people don’t want to help others anymore it’s sad really. Nobody really understands what you’re going through unless they been through it.😞
SuicideWatch,fplklp0,t1_fplka0p,1588714400.0,"I’m not really okay with this life, I’ve been following everyone else for years and it doesn’t make me happy at all. But I do understand why we have to work for money and  this is just the way the world was made.."
death,fpljo25,t3_gduk27,1588713912.0,"I definitely feel you I’m ready to go too. That’s why I mostly just sleep my pain away living here is so draining. I never asked to be here but now I have to suffer and slave and pay bills. It’s so miserable I don’t understand how someone could enjoy living here. All I can hope for is that you keep holding on and just remeber even though I don’t really know you, I definitely feel what you’re going through and you’re never alone🙏🏾"
SuicideWatch,fplixqw,t1_fplitbp,1588713540.0,"Perfectly said🙏🏾, some people notice this too then there are others who are okay with this. It’s just tiring I wish there was more then just paying bills working. It’s not easy when you don’t have enough money or time to just do what you really want to do."
SuicideWatch,fplis8z,t1_fpliq8r,1588713461.0,I did not say I want to kill my self thought I’m just saying how I feel about living here. Thanks though
SuicideWatch,fpjznde,t3_gdryi5,1588684919.0,So true exactly how I feel. And people love to say that this is a free country and you can achieve anything that’s such bs!! they make it so hard for you to even do stuff
SuicideWatch,fp61dub,t1_fp61a5v,1588344222.0,So true!!! They call you lazy if you complain about working
SuicideWatch,fp4lnrq,t3_gb5skq,1588301779.0,This is why I’m trying to start my own business but it’s not easy when you’re drained from your slave ship job. I strongly hateeee with a passion having somebody over my life like it just sounds silly and stupid why do I have to answer to a boss!! I seriously hope one day working isn’t mandatory but still be able to make money or live freely. Life shouldn’t be all about working especially right now why are we relying on jobs when they can shut down at anytime. 😞
SuicideWatch,fp22dqt,t3_gap11g,1588253714.0,You don’t deserve to go through any pain. You said that you’re a burden and that you make people miserable that’s not a crime. Also that may not even be the case. A lot of the times I feel like I’m a burden on people and that I make them miserable. But even if I do I’m only human and that’s how they feel and if that’s how they feel then who cares really. I am not perfect and neither are you. Don’t be soo hard on yourself. You’re doing the best that you can. Everyday you wake up you’re strong because you’re still here. And hey that has got to be an accomplishment!! We are living in hell I believe this is hell. And you’re still fighting it you’re a survivor honestly through all the pain you face through the negative thoughts that play in your head you keep going. For me all I do is play video games and listen to music I got criticized for playing video games and buying a new system during this pandemic people told me I should be saving for a car lmao. But that makes me happy so I say do what makes you happy and helps you escape and forget about the negatives. Also this life is only temporary it’s not forever one day you will be free!! Just keep holding on though I’m always here for you stay safe and stay here🙏🏾♥️
SuicideWatch,fp21o2u,t3_gaspr5,1588253257.0,I feel the same way. I feel stupid and that I make a lot of mistakes really surprised I havnt been locked up or fired yet from my job because of all the stupid mistakes I’ve made. But hey atleast you’re not alone! You can do this!! And none of this is your fault just another thing we can’t really control the whole lockdown thing. A lot of people are feeling the same way right now.it sucks to just be trapped in a house while chaos is going on outside. This life is only temporary though. One day we will escape and be free from this hell prison. Just keep hanging on!! If there’s something in life even if it’s just a small thing that makes you happy think of it when you feel down at times. And you can message me anytime if you like I’m here for you! Stay safe and you got this🙏🏾♥️
SuicideWatch,fp211y8,t3_gaun4x,1588252864.0,"Life is really hard it’s a mess isn’t it? But it’s not your fault, you’re never alone a lot of people are going through this too I’m 23 and everyday does feel the same wake up and slave for a boss and repeat pay bills till you die it’s sooo boring. Sometimes I feel like a caged animal really I just be ready to go. It’s worst when you don’t have money to travel or do fun things. Life is hell. That’s why I just listen to music and play video games mostly it’s kind of my only escape really. Do you have any thing that helps you escape or gives you a little bit of joy? Just remeber though this life is only temporary and this isn’t forever it’s not going to always be like this♥️ I’m here for you stay safe 🙏🏾"
SuicideWatch,forjaqy,t3_g93cz5,1588013185.0,Don’t we all 😭 sleeping is so peaceful till you have to get up and go slave for a boss or go to school. 😞
SuicideWatch,forj3hs,t3_g8xn1u,1588013090.0,I wish there was something that I could say that would make you feel better. But honestly I feel the same way the best thing I can tell you is that this life this shit hole of a hell we are in right now is not forever! This will not last forever and that pain that you’re feeling it’s not a forever thing. Use your pain and make champagne with it. One day we all escape but don’t kill yourself if it fails then you may end up messing your body up even more. You do sound a lot like me and I just can’t see anymore people that I can relate too dying😞 please don’t go we have to stick together to fight this war. You can message me anytime stay strong and b safe 🙏🏾
SuicideWatch,foqvptd,t1_foqvmsq,1588001669.0,Thank you for that 🙏🏾 I try to everyday
SuicideWatch,foqtxme,t1_foqturr,1588000768.0,That’s why I love sleeping soo much. Atleast I can dream of a better life and just escape for a few hours but it sucks waking back up to this shit hope of a mess
SuicideWatch,foqtq27,t1_foqtnbi,1588000659.0,I wanna die too man! I don’t understand how someone could enjoy life it’s so miserable and it feels like we have no power we are just controlled 😞
