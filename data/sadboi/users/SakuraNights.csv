1. [UP5097](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/5097?nav) \- This one fits the age range and date of death, but is estimated to be an inch taller, and weighed more than Dwayne. Still possible.
2. [UP2831](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/2831?nav)\- Fits all but the age range, he's a couple of years older than Dwayne was. I think this John Doe would be the closest to our guy. 
3. [UP5134](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/5134?nav)\- It's only one bone, but the possibility is there.

Anything he has or may send you in the future that shows his abusive behavior, save and document. If you live with him, make sure you have a safe place to move to. Don’t be afraid to have the police escort you to get your things. And if he verbally starts abusing you and you are in a one-party consent state (assuming you’re in the states, I’m not quite sure how other countries handle recording) record his ass. Anything that can be used against him if he tries to retaliate against you, do it.
