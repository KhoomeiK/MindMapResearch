BipolarReddit,fplrrvd,t3_gdo88z,1588718226.0,"This one can be tricky, but don't overthink it.  Remember,  bipolar disorder only defines how you take care of yourself, it doesn't define who you are.  I would keep it brief, but give your potential partner the opportunity to ask questions.  Speak about your triumphs and treatment.  I'd suggest acknowledging the darkness but not dwelling in it.  Be as clear as possible, for there are plenty of misconceptions about bipolar disorder.

I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 2 years, and she has been a loving partner, but she doesn't let me use my disorder as a cop out.  I would say what has kept us strong has been our willingness to communicate clearly and honestly.  I would agree that it's best to bring it up as soon as you're comfortable.   Best of luck!"

BipolarReddit,fmrq3vh,t3_fwsx3u,1586331378.0,I haven't read that book since college 20 years ago. My parents read it 1st and basically force me to as if it were an assignment. I should give it a revisit though!
BipolarReddit,f399zwj,t3_d9xr11,1570745501.0,"Update: I got not 1 but 2 notes from my PDOC and met with my employer the next morning. I determined long before the meeting that there was no reason for me to go back to work there, but I did follow through with his requests. He offered to write a letter of recommendation, but I already had a job offer at the time.  I was given another job offer which I accepted later that morning, I started on Monday. 

Thank you all so much for your advice, and I will certainly NEVER disclose my diagnosis to an employer again."
BipolarReddit,f1pga0m,t3_dacoqo,1569679816.0,"If your mind is telling you things that arent real, that's one thing.  If this information is causing you to do things you wouldnt normally do, that is another.  Both are abnormal,  but the actions you are taking to deal with it could be perceived by others to be abnormal."
BipolarReddit,f1okbr6,t1_f1ohtb1,1569648996.0,"Thank you, I feel discriminated against.  I haven't worked for 6 weeks, the power is about to get shut off, I could get evicted, and I'm exhausted from trying to figure this out.  I certainly NEVER plan to disclose ever again.  

I very well might have a case, I am hoping to explore this.  Fortunately I had a really good interview Thursday and another on Tuesday.   But in the grand scheme I also still work for this company.   It's a real mindfuck.  I will certainly update as I learn more."
BipolarReddit,f1ohm30,t1_f1ohiha,1569645899.0,"Thank you.  I genuinely appreciate that.  This is certainly a weird one, not one many ""civillians"" would understand."

Unfortunately, I disclosed my diagnosis to my employer after a day when I got completely dehydrated and had an unrelated medical issue.  I had to explain that I take lithium which means I have to drink even more water in the summer than the average person."

BipolarReddit,f1ohapv,t1_f1lyrct,1569645550.0,"I dont know if it is or not. Based off what the EEOC said, the note my employer provided wasnt illegal.  We will see how it all plays out."

BipolarReddit,f1oh4r2,t1_f1nxocy,1569645370.0,"This is 100% correct about HIPPA. I know this because I followed up at the local EEOC office.  I was told that ""my employer is being kind, and most employers would have fired me for cause.""

 You may be correct about the ADA, and I might follow up later.  Fortunately I got some of his requests in writing.  I will discuss this all on Tuesday the 1st with my PDOC.  And no worries, I appreciate the nitpicking with this dicey issue."

BipolarReddit,ey6euto,t3_cvrx13,1566853956.0,Same.  My current employer is requiring the results of my bloodwork so that I can return to work.  Is that legal?

BipolarReddit,erx0y8p,t1_erwkhw9,1561366059.0,"I will always be the same person and I will always have the same disease, I realized that I won't escape that. I have gotten better by growing weary and tired of being alone because I push everyone away with my words and actions. What I have gained through bipolar disorder is character, compassion, and the ability to clearly communicate while extremely emotional."
