Still, even with my current boyfriend who i have amazing sexual chemistry with, i usually just help. It's less pressure for both of us. So while it feels great to just lay back, do nothing and finish, it's stressful and on average takes like 20 minutes. Fuck that noise."

That's not to say everyone will, though. It's obviously a very intense thing. Also tricky. There was one point where i thought the trip was done, looked at my phone, and it was like looking at a hologram. That sent me into another peak. 

The friend that made it for me thought it was over one of his first times and decided to have himself a burger at ruby tuesday. He worked there. His trip was not over. He had a bad time. So, as with any psychadelic, you gotta just be prepared for the unknown."

unpopularopinion,fi7hn49,t1_fi7br2b,1582221564.0,"How is getting a better job and working on a mental illness comparable? Your generalization implies that the problem for men is not living up to society's standards for success, and the problem for women is they're just crazy and refuse to acknowledge or work on it. I understand you're trying to exemplify that men are shat on for the littlest things while women get away with pretty much anything. That is just not true though. Most of the women I know, including myself, have never been unwilling to be with a man because of social status or finances. In fact, most of the women I know started dating a man who was entirely unsuccessful and had no prospects, and they were simply okay with that because they loved them, including myself. A big problem in those relationships ended up being the mental health issues the men refused to acknowledge or work on. A lot of women know they have issues, admit that, and accept when there is a problem in their relationship that could be attributed to their mental health. This isn't to say that there aren't men who also do this, or that this is the case 100% of the time. I just feel your generalization was unfair."
