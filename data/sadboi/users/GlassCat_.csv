There currently isn't logic to determine how to handle a white wood fence from a standard wood fence. There's just Simple Wooden Fence that can be one to fifty pieces. They could set a variation property per fencing item, but they'd then need to update the ui to support either a new name and or image (Simple Wooden Fence - White). Each variation would then need to be its own stack. They also don't have logic to change how many customization kits are used based on what's changing or based on stack total- each item has a static amount. How many kits are used to customize one, ten, or fifty fence pieces? Since I can only buy stacks of five customization kits at a time (MORE PLEASE), they couldn't realistically make it a 1-to-1 requirement. Let's say it's one kit per ten fence pieces. If I customize eleven pieces will I be required to use two kits even though I'm only one over the ten max? There's many ways they can handle this request/feature/enhancement.

I have a hard time adjusting to any type of change in my life so seeing her less and not getting the same opportunity to share activities was really hard on me. It's a personal flaw that I've been spending a lot of time working on. Life throws obstacles at you from left and right, and instead of figuring things out and doing some internal reflection, I was taking it personally and letting it distract me from the time I did have with her. Being bipolar and a smidge on the spectrum makes any change ten times more impactful. 

I have placed her on a pedestal and have realized that her mind was thing I was most in love with; I just appreciate how she thinks and how motivated she is when accomplishing her goals. I've tried to talk to other women to see if I can shake my feelings, but they don't process things the same, and I don't feel the same comfort that I initially felt with her.

My physical self wasn't an issue (granted I was a stick that only ate once a day), but not actively taking care of your physical self has big impacts on your mental state.

AskReddit,fj82n5n,t3_fbunwo,1583103762.0,"It was originally a poem by Marianne Williamson called *Our Deepest Fear* and was adapted in the movie Coach Carter. I'm not religious, but I appreciate the intent and meaning:


Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.

It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.

We ask ourselves

Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?

Actually, who are you not to be?
You are a child of God.

Your playing small does not serve the world.

There's nothing enlightened about shrinking

So that other people won't feel insecure around you.

We are all meant to shine, as children do.

We were born to make manifest

The glory of God that is within us.

It's not just in some of us;
It's in everyone.

And as we let our own light shine,
we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.

As we're liberated from our own fear,

Our presence automatically liberates others.

borderlands3,fg0c3hc,t3_ew764z,1580404662.0,"Meh. I played MMOs for years - from RO (talk about a grind) to WoW to all the others that lasted a couple years and then died. The difference is that there's various ways to obtain gear - yes, dungeons and raids had some of the best gear and were extremely hit and miss; however, you could also get gear through PvP/battlegrounds, faction reputation, auction houses, various events/token systems, world events, etc. We're talking varied game play. Yes, all of it required grinding in some shape or form, but the activities were different enough that it was fun. You're also doing these tedious activities with friends and guild/clan members. Remove the other people and limit the activities to a single pattern (kill enemy, reset the game, repeat), and you're left with something that is drastically different than an MMO. Running a dungeon or raid will be two fold more fun than killing The Unstoppable for 4 hours. Even when you didn't get the gear you needed and lost your need rolls, it could still be fun and you could log off satisfied. With BL if you don't get the gear you need doing the same thing for a whole day you leave feeling gross and annoyed.

BL is not an MMO. If they added 5 more end games activities, meaningful manufacturer rep and quests, some sort of PvP system, various level instances that weren't just Slaughter Shaft clones, faction vendors to buy actual end-game gear, etc then maybe I'd agree."

It's cool seeing all the anointed gear (even though most of them aren't what I'm looking for), but certain drops just aren't showing up, and it's become extremely disheartening spending hours farming for something that won't drop. It'd be neat if we could at least get mail after 20 or so kills of a named enemy/boss that rolled with one of their dedicated drops. Say I farm Agonizer for The Dictator all day, Tannis could mail me something snarky with one of his dedicated drops as a reward."

borderlands3,ff3x9nb,t1_ff34m00,1579550859.0,"This. I almost feel like I'm not cut out for BL3. I've played every game in the series and am a huge fan, but right now having almost prefect gear is required for M4, and I'm just not on the good side of rng. Even with the increased spawns and ""increased drop rates"" I'm still barely getting the drops I need, and I've yet to get any with the right anoints. I'm just not having that much fun killing the same spawns for days on end - remove the increased spawn rates and I know I'll never see the gear I'd like to get. Not sure why I can't take parts from the ten versions of the same weapon and combine them into the variation/configuration I'd like to use. Hell, give us a chance to reroll anoints on gear, doesn't matter if the chance is low, it at least provides another method outside farming the same spawn for days on end."

HumansBeingBros,fcvr5qb,t1_fcv4iyr,1578008236.0,"I hate the ""he's old"" logic. Having attended powerlifting meets, training at a powerlifting gym, and with a coach who specializes in powerlifting, I've seen many people in their late 40s and 50s easily moving heavy weights. The last meet I attended a 60yo+ guy set a bench record for his age and class. 225 is definitely impressive for most people, but for people in the sport, you only do yourself a disservice training at half your ROM. In terms of size and strength, you'll get more out of a movement lowering the weight and doing a full rep. All that said, maybe it was his intention to do half reps as there is definitely training techniques which call for limited ROM as you can't get the full spring/explosiveness when going all the way down.

But whatever. I'm always happy to see people past their prime still grinding in the gym - just gotta drop a bit of that ego as older bodies are less forgiving."
assholedesign,fcullxo,t1_fcuf3p4,1577983685.0,Exactly what I was thinking. We had our junior dev spend most of last year updating all our public facing sites to be ADA compliant. That shit won't fly in the least bit.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fcaqzt3,t1_fc9btod,1577574878.0,"I'm not sure I agree with this. I've bought many thin condoms which are appropriately sized and they definitely feel very different. The first time I had a condom break my mind was absolutely blown at the sensation difference; however, I definitely wouldn't put my pleasure in front of a partner's health and physical and emotional well-being. Men have birth control options as well, and I've never been too sure why it always falls on women to endure the potential burden that comes with birth control."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fcaq29e,t1_fc928gt,1577574319.0,"I'll be honest. I hate wearing condoms. It's sort of like being bipolar or depressed and being put on medication which treats you by numbing you out (I have plenty of experience here). Are you functioning and alive? Yes. Do you feel happy and have joy in your life. Not really, you kind of just are. I've tried many condoms and have some that I like more than others, but I'd much rather not use one. All that being said, I don't want kids, ever, and if I was with a partner who was having a problem on birth control I'd easily opt to get snipped. I'll probably do this anyway in the next few years even though I'm not sure I'll be entering a relationship any time soon. I take test and steroids for bodybuilding so I know exactly how fucked up you can feel when taking something that messes with hormones, and I would never guilt trip someone for their decision to avoid birth control."
photoshopbattles,fc3vcfv,t1_fc3eq18,1577399574.0,"Ya, screw companies like this. They're the reason devs like myself have to support legacy software that not even 1% of people still use. You end up with hundreds of lines of spaghetti code just to handle legacy software. I had a mini party in my cube corral when my company finally said ""enough is enough, we're not supporting any clients in IE8 - that's it, we're done.""

Don't try to be special and reinvent the wheel if you aren't going to keep your software up to date with the rest of the world. Absolutely absurd.

Edit- I still find subversion comments with previous devs cursing their hacks to make things work in IE 6 and 7."

pcmasterrace,fa7u1ab,t1_fa7e2dv,1575838183.0,"I've owned 3 Nagas... The middle mouse button/scroll is what broke on the two previous ones. They use some cheap plastic dowel instead of a piece of metal. The dowel always snaps. Everytime I look for a different brand mouse with better construction, I end up going back to the Naga because it's still the only one that offers a full numpad.

Edit: I did buy the g600 before my third Naga, but mine broke within a couple weeks. Not sure what happened, but certain keys on the numpad just quit working. I returned it and ended up picking up my current Naga which has lasted longer than the other 2. I like the feel of the Nagas over the g600 anyway."

relationship_advice,f9ebavt,t1_f9bd5ta,1575241829.0,"Fucking thank you. I hate when people discredit a medication based off their own research and experiences. All our brains are wired differently and we all respond to medications differently. I'm Bipolar 2 and it's a fucking pain. I've been prescribed every medication under the sun, from atypical antipsychotics to mood stabilizers to antidepressants and often a combination of a few. It took a few psychs and years of trial and error before finding the right cocktail for myself. As I aged I also became more aware of my cycles, incorrect patterns of thinking, and found healthy coping mechanisms. Do I love life and look forward to each new day? Fuck no, but I get by and have held my current job as a web engineer for 7 years, took up healthy-ish hobbies like photography and bodybuilding, and fixed my poor eating habits which contributed to many of my symptoms.

When I was younger I had to live in a homeless shelter for people with mental illness. We obviously compared which medications we were on and it was truly mind blowing seeing some of these people function on medications and dosages which would personally debilitate me. There were individuals on quadruple the Seroquel dosages that I had been on, and my dosages absolutely drained me of all energy... Meanwhile they're barely brought back down to earth with energy to spare.

Depakote works amazing for me and it pisses me off seeing someone, who probably just Googled it, tell someone it's worthless because it's used for something else. News flash - most psych medications have a variety of uses. Mental illness is drastically different than most physical illnesses. You often have to try and change medications to find what works for you. It's absolutely discouraging seeing progress and then slipping or having a side effect cause you to switch...but that's just part of the stupid journey we have to deal with. One thing is very clear to me though. I'll NEVER have kids because all this is very likely genetic and I'd never want someone else dealing with this shit."
trees,f8308mo,t1_f82lqw7,1574201657.0,"Ya, I always hear that too. Most people don't realize a dependency can be developed with just about anything you do often enough. It's like getting super into the gym or a person you like - will skipping the gym or not seeing that person physically kill you like an opiate withdrawal - nope. It can cause you severe mental distress, sleep disruption, irritability, sweats, etc. Anyone who's gone on a tolerance break after a long period of heavy use knows the first few days can be frustrating to deal with - that's a dependency."
trees,f82gb3z,t1_f81qgag,1574190654.0,"This. Like alcohol, I've found the more dependent on cannabis a person becomes, the more hostile they are when not under the influence. Some people are grumpy because it brings them medical relief and they don't like being in pain, but I've came across a fair amount of people who use it recreationaly who are real jerks until they can get high again. I used to dab every hour from the moment I woke up, and it made me a super intolerable person when I couldn't. I became short, uncomfortable, anxious, and everything else you become when mentally withdrawing from something. I took a 6 month break and decided to stick with vaping flower - life has been much less cloudy and stress inducing."

There's plenty of user experiences and some decent logs here if you search for them.

Hair shedding is really only a problem if you're predisposed to it. Everyone is different though, as you know. I'm not predisposed to balding, but I did have some extremely minor shedding that went away once my cycle finished. Some people run with an AI; I'd say most users don't though. I'd honestly recommend against using an AI if this is your first cycle. Have one on hand for sure. Did you get your bloods done?"
PEDs,f79qjxk,t1_f75kdtm,1573513078.0,Yup yup! Don't be afraid to get some more calories in as your strength gains go up. Always good to have more nutrients for recovery than less.

You'll be putting on that extra muscle which will help keep the fat gains in check and most likely burn through some. Obviously make sure to eat enough protein (.8 - 1 grams of your goal bodyweight). You'll be able to feel and see your body changing so you can make adjustments for bf% while still gaining strength and lean muscle. I'd sooner add a few light 10-20 minute cardio sessions in a week than take a calorie intake hit - you'll be able to push yourself more and will want that energy. We're all different so just weigh yourself a few times a week, check the mirror, and calibrate from there!"
PEDs,f74z1l3,t3_duez2d,1573410060.0,"Pretty much depends on your goals. Not sure how tall you are but 165 could be extremely small (can be very advantageous if you compete in powerlifting though). I'm also not sure what your bf% was when you were 200 - if you were 200@12%bf, I'm sure you feel small af right now. I'm 5'11 at around 10%bf and 208ish pounds. A year ago I was 158 and was a fucking stick so that's my measure.

It's winter time and you want to add size so I'd say bulk and get your size/strength back - as long as you approach things smart and don't re-injure yourself, your size and strength should bounce back quick af. 

Also, if you're looking to compete, you could try to find a coach (not a trainer). Seems like you're focusing on strength and a coach will keep you from over committing and injuring yourself as well as getting you to where you want to be as efficiently as possible."
