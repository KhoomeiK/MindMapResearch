And you're right, the standards are very different for research and industrial production, the psilocybin that was originally used was produced in Dave Nichols' lab and you'd **never** get away with marketing a medication made in a university laboratory using non-GMP reagents, not to mention the production costs (expertise, time, material) to produce sufficient amounts in sufficient purity to supply what will be an enormous demand for the drug (given worldwide rates of depression) - you can't just make a bunch of psilocybin, stick it in an LCMS and say ""99% purity, job done"" and throw around the high-fives, the origin of every reagent must be traceable and accountable and of pharmaceutical grade.

Behavioral effects can be inferred first by rodent head-twitch response, following up with trained animal discrimination studies all the way up to primates if one wishes for clinical success. 

To get an idea of oral activity and persistence in the body you must study incubation with gastric secretions, incubation with blood serum, whole blood, incubation with liver microsomes, etc. PLUS metabolomic studies with animals (and previous fluids) using varying ROAs (typically necessitating development of a GC- or LC/MS protocol to identify drug and metabolites, and their fate in the body), also ideally radiotracer studies with animals (all the way up to primates) followed by sectioning and autoradiography at various time periods to show distribution, elimination, accumulation in various tissues (much easier if your drug has a fluorine as you can use 18F tag for PET, or 11C or 15O if you're really fancy, or 125I for gamma emission imaging if your drug has an iodine that is non-labile, otherwise you're stuck with autoradiography of tritiated drugs).

Small-molecules wise most of the morphinans, morphans and benzomorphans, tramadol and its derivatives, mitragynine alkaloids, Trevena's compounds (e.g. TRV130/Oliceridine, though the O is on a thiophene not benzene), the only *major* class I can think of that doesn't typically include a phenolic hydroxy would be fentanyl derivatives."

So yeah, the molecule might not be great (especially as IME computational models are only just now becoming useful - my computational collaborations have typically yielded little) but the intramolecular distance between phenolic hydroxy and the basic amine isn't a bad place to look WRT opioid drug function - both are important to the ""message"" (following the message/address model often used to describe opioid binding) - the basic amine forms a salt bridge with D3.32 and disrupts its intramolecular interaction with Y7.43, facilitating the phenolic hydroxy's water-mediated interaction with H6.52 causing TM6 to kink outwards and allow G-protein activation and dissociation."

*More detail if you're interested - paracetamol toxicity is activated in the liver by oxidation to a toxic metabolite (NAPQI) which can easily be reduced itself and thus oxidize and conjugate to other things in your liver causing damage. NAC is a bioavailable precursor to glutathione (GSH), which is around in the liver to mop up such reactive species by conjugation; sufficiently high doses of paracetamol can use up all of the available GSH leaving free reactive species to do damage to your liver in various ways by conjugating or oxidizing proteins, DNA/RNA etc. Introducing an excess of GSH via NAC prevents this. Interestingly CYP3A4 is not only involved in the deactivation of codeine (to mostly inactive norcodeine) but also in the activation of paracetamol to NAPQI, so I wonder if the specific presence of codeine may help mitigate any damage by paracetamol (by competitively inhibiting paracetamol oxidation to NAPQI). Grapefruit juice also inhibits CYP3A4 so is a good adjunct to any attempts at codeine intoxication if you wish to minimize paracetamol damage (bearing in mind that the required codeine dose is lowered, so overdose is a risk).*"

Other than as a software engineer there are many other options, I'll try and list and elaborate on a few:

A pharmacologist working on understanding how psychedelics work? Yeah definitely, there's a fair few professors across the world trying to figure that out (Robin Carhart-Harris and David Nutt at Imperial, Chuck Nichols at LSU, Bryan Roth at UNCCH to name a few) and I expect the academia around psychedelics will only continue to grow for the foreseeable future as it continues to be legitimized by the media (maybe the one and only thing I like them for...) and the clinical trials continue to go well. 

A clinician conducting human research/clinical trials for therapeutic applications? It's already happening right now, in fact by some of those names listed above. How much the industry blows up depends on trial success, but there will be a steady stream of need to test each psychedelic (for the time being those being psilocybin and LSD) for different indications, which will be much easier once ONE indication is approved and they move each drug from schedule I to schedule II (assuming trials continue to be as successful as they have been, I'd estimate this will be in 2-5 years for psilocybin, and say 4-8 years for LSD - MDMA even sooner but it's not *really* a psychedelic, depending on preferred definition). 

A chemist developing novel psychedelic molecules? That all depends on how well clinical trials and basic research go; if there is a need to find new structures (say, to optimize therapeutic effects and minimize issues by taking advantage of a previous *unknown*) then jobs for that will open up in pharmaceutical companies, and the success of said efforts will be dependent on what we learn from the basic science. Many labs working on the structural nature of drug-receptor-cell-tissue-organ-body-mind relationships of psychedelics often have collaborators who synthesize new molecules for them in order to test their ideas/differentially probe receptors, though some have (or had) their own chemists. 

These positions do however tend to be very sought after amongst the ""community"", in fact any position related to working on psychedelics can be extremely competitive right now but the field *should* open up soon given the positive track of clinical trials and recent scientific advancements.

Being female will likely help her avoid the suspicion of being a ""groupie"" (a term borrowed by some more elitist psychedelic researchers to describe non-professional scientists who covet their work) which would hold in her favor to find positions with them."

Either way in terms of your specific question of optimizing kappa antagonism, that would still seem to be achieved by operating at higher levels of the metabolite and lower levels of NTX itself, and the metabolite should be capable of accumulating with steady, low doses of NTX due to their drastic differences in half-life."
AskDrugNerds,fjms4lk,t3_fe685m,1583481508.0,"Almost certainly by maximizing the AUC of naltrexone's metabolite 6β-Naltrexol while keeping naltrexone itself at a lower level. 

There is likely an optimal dose-over-time which would vary a fair amount between people - continuous infusion at that rate would probably be the optimal way to achieve this (if you were doing it yourself that'd mean dosing little, and often). 

Naltrexone's half-life is only around 4 hours compared to 6β-Naltrexol's 11 hours, so 6β-Naltrexol should build up even at sub-saturating naltrexone doses, which might explain how ULDN works. 

6β-Naltrexol allegedly has higher intrinsic activity at Mu (lower antagonistic activity); unfortunately I got distracted for a couple hours in between writing this response and I can't find the relative mu/delta/kappa activities for 6β-Naltrexol vs. Naltrexone, but that might indicate higher relative affinity for kappa > mu if it is to answer why ULDN seems to work.

TheeHive,fjamq4u,t1_fjajk58,1583176525.0,"Imo the most compelling current hypothesis (following the inability to reproduce Bohn's linking of respiratory depression to BArr2) is suggested by von Zastrow, in that it is related to the activation of mu opioid receptors which have not been trafficked to the CSM (cell surface membrane), something that we call the receptor reserve.

Extremely lipophilic opioid drugs can more easily cross the CSM and activate receptors that are within different parts of mu-expressing neurons (e.g. the ER) and from there elicit deleterious effects.

To corroborate the observed differences in therapeutic indices, we see that fentanyl is far more lipophilic than carfentanil (lacking carfentanil's enormous ester side-chain) so despite carfentanil's higher mu affinity and therapeutic efficacy, its toxicity does not increase by the same extent, perhaps because it has less propensity towards activating these internal receptors and causing respiratory depression.

This might suggest that many of the mu receptors within the PreBötzinger complex which depress breathing are not as heavily trafficked to the cell surface membrane, so less likely to be activated by less lipophilic drugs, though afaik that specific idea has not been the subject of any studies (I'm just thinking aloud, maybe someone will steal my idea and make a paper out of it)."

Drug-drug interactions or even certain foods can also cause induction of certain enzymes beyond their typical levels, or Inhibition (as is more widely discussed), and so result in a change in the predominant metabolites.

How old are you? It takes time to learn about these things and I hate to feel like I could be helping spoil a good relationship, but in my experience if somebody doesn't ""get"" your humor it makes being truthful and de-escalating situations far more difficult, in fact it makes communication more difficult in general.

Also, this will probably get me a ton of shit from others but people's ability to ""get"" humor is correlated with their intelligence ([in particular dark humor](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10339-016-0789-y), which I expect you have if you're ENTP), likely due to the processing/rectification of different concepts or pieces of information involved, something which is not likely to change over time. 

Humor processing also seems to play a [large role in relationship compatibility](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704915598918) so take that however you will. 

With that being said, I don't understand why you are worrying about this *now* and seeking the advice of strangers on the internet; all of the interesting stories are the ones that were different to the others so why not give it a go?

My advice would be to just see how it goes, assuming that being in this relationship isn't exploitative or wasting either of your time in a negative way? That way if you DO grow to love her then you will be happy, end of, and if you don't love her then you won't ever truly commit meaning that if you meet someone who really tickles your funny bone then you can break things off with this girl (HONESTLY and tactfully) and be with someone who really matches your speed.

Simple."

Speaking strictly from personal experience I would say the way he might see you as different is that you have an innocence and/or a sensitivity about you that he wants to support and protect. 

He wouldn't want to treat you like a hit-it-and-quit-it person which is a good thing (and probably why he hasn't tried), and I expect that he wouldn't make a direct move for fear of how you might feel (as we ENTPs live in uncertainty [Ne] and draw our feelings from our environment [Fe]).

I don't know with what regularity you see each other in person, or whether you socialize as a pair or in a group, so that makes your next precise move unknown. You can do things slow or you can try and do things fast and direct - If you usually hang out in a group ask him to something with just the two of you, if you already usually hang out as a pair then you can either joke with him about your next interaction being a date and keep the joke going (what a nice date, etc. - if that is your type of humor relationship, don't force it) and *eventually* progress from there, **or** you can ask him direct and straight up if he would be interested in giving dating between the two of you a try.

It's a *really* hard gap to bridge between humor and seriousness with us ENTPs, as in to force us to be serious about a situation, I expect because we associate seriousness negatively (often because we always feel taken *too* seriously by people), so just try your best to keep things slow, casual and fun before cranking up the emotional side of things with him, but also don't hide your affection or seem like you're after something or playing games either.

One thing I cannot stress enough is don't push him too hard and don't try to let out your 5 years of built-up affection at once, just be straight up, try not to be nervous and ask him if he'd be interested in giving dating between you two a go.
