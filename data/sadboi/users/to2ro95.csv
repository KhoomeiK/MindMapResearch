We could never really know for sure, as the government's lackluster response and testing won't ever be able to check for it now which makes contact tracing pretty much impossible.. I personally thought Mardi gras was a major contributor to Italy's amount of cases, but a huge number of other factors went into it as well (lifestyle hygiene, smoking habits, etc).

But we are legitimately going to be making things worse by not sticking with restrictions. NOW is the time to double down. Not ease up. Without social distancing all those projected numbers we heard about in Jan/Feb/March about millions infected and hundreds of thousands of dying will be true. We all have shit to worry about and im sorry thats happened to you and your close ones.

My family's friend was one of the first ones to die in Contra Costa up north. Of covid19. My friends and family are constantly putting themselves in dnager as they work in the med field or even for a frickin grocery store. My dad could literally die from the regular flu, imagine if he got covid19. 

You're forgetting that hospitals don't take in just covid19 patients, they take in the regular amount as well. Which is a huge number. Did you know my emt friend waited with a patient in the er last year for four hours? Imagine if that happened now. 

Keep the larger perspective in mind. I don't even have a good home situation, but we all have to stick it out. If we had voted for competent people handling this, we woulda been in a much better place we're in than now. We might have even had a realistic date to end stay at home orders. But it's too late now.

Stay busy to keep as sane as possible. But stay busy inside or away from people. Go for a walk if you need to with a mask on during times when no one's out. Hell, Take a drive on an empty stretch of road roll the windows down, park and look up at rhe sky or the view. I haven't been able to get out at all since before March. Not even for a drive or a walk. Because if I come back with germs someone else left I could literally kill my family. That means I can't work or go out to school or see my boyfriend or friends or hang out anywhere.

All for the sake of someone wanting to go to the beach.

My family and I began preparations around February so i understand. But it's gotten worse since then so we have to act accordingly. 

I may just be cynical but I don't think anyone would social distance at the beaches and parks if theyre opened. Theres the forbidden fruit thing where people will go out when they regularly dont just because they can't. There's the fact that stupid people do stupid shit. There's the fact that we all may have been infected by the time we were in quarantine and opening things up slowly is all well ans good. It's what everyone wants. They're not saying it's forever. 

It's for now. When we're about to hit the peak. CA has done a fine job thus far flattening the curve. But you can't expect things to get any better when you ease up on these restrictions. Those people shouldn't even be out in the first place.

There is always a second wave. It is proven historically and scientifically and mathematically so I'm not gonna waste time, as much as we all have, talking about that. 

We aren't trying to eliminate anything, rather mitigate. So my bad if that was the confusion. I understand it's not possible to completely go to 0%. But you have to have things closed for at least a period of time so everyone can be safe. Better now and for a month than later when things get so bad we have to stock up for more than half a year. 

Be proactive and quarantine now and test now to ensure infection doesn't spread continuously since we don't know who's infected. Don't be reactive and have things open up and reinfect people. Parks and state beaches would have to have capacity limits. And then that becomes a debate with someone about rights and how they have the right to be there any time cause they live near the land or so on and so forth.

Everyone has a right to do what they want, so long as it doesn't impede on others rights. But rn you wanting the park open isn't right for everyone."

Open it up, then what? Everyone lets their guard down, everyone goes out now, everyone experiences the second wave now. 

And just because you've never seen these places crowded pre-shutdown it doesn't mean it wasn't crowded ever. That's like just because you're not hungry it means there's no world hunger. Everything opening up leaves more chance of bacteria being left in these places and spreading when everyone is out. You're also putting risk on people who have to work to take care of these places and resources can be put to helping the actual pandemic. 

It confuses the average citizen into thinking things are safe when that's not the case at the moment. The president isn't using a mask, makes it voluntary when the CDC and Fauci say to wear one. The president says that he's got things under control, we see more deaths every day. 

Opening up some of the most popular beaches and parks in the country? That gives the impression that things are dying down.

And social distancing 6 feet away lessens the risk of infection. It doesn't eliminate the risk altogether. You have no idea who has it or not. And now you've exposed others to your air and your germs that you've left wherever you went and they go home and someone dies. Multiplying that by millions means you're essentially telling everyone who's sick and immunocompromised to fuck it and see if you're alive after spending two weeks straight at home self isolating cause I want to lie down on sand for twenty minutes.

Also you can get the damn thing AGAIN even if you've recovered cause theres no vaccine yet. And now you're compromised further and have a higher chance of dying."

I usually also try to recommend group therapy but obviously now thats not an option.

 So I have to remain absolutely clean for my father who is sick and his immune system is weakened. But practically everyone in my University has a cough and more than two thirds in my brothers University is wearing masks. People are still going to work and school while sick and ignoring the fact that the average person has terrible hygiene practice.

And thank you for sharing that, especially on a public forum. My own parents have been through the worst of it with medications and treatment as well, and I agree that educating oneself is essential and questioning a medical issue is always beneficial. But on this type of platform it just seems that your post came off too anti med for some reason? I think my own comment can came off heavily pro medication as well. I just think it's hard to tell people that you're going no medication knowing full well that you'll be on a mood stabilizer for the rest of your future life. And it doesn't sound healthy to WAIT for an episode to come before getting help. It seems more reactive than proactive. 

Sure, the holistic thing is being proactive, but if you know your disorder is bad enough that you may need them in the future to cope then wouldn't it be better to be on a low, steady dose so when you do feel an episode coming you can better handle it with that plus the holistic approaches?

You need to take your meds even if you're feeling better and don't need them. That's the illness!!

Lifestyle changes are a massive help but not the end all be all. Medications work the same way and it's the balance of both that we need therapists and psychiatrists for. That's why we need to communicate to them openly, honestly, and constantly. (I myself am only on two different medications, and both therapist and psydoc know I smoke weed to alleviate irritability and anxiety on top of it so they know to adjust accordingly or advise me when I may be overusing in an upswing, but I'm lucky that that's all I need to manage! Others need heavier medications and dosages and others can't smoke at all)

Taking medication for a diagnosed mental illness is a necessary way to manage so that episodes aren't as bad and moods aren't as bad of an upswing or downswing WITHOUT it. It's not a bandaid that makes the illness automatically go away, external factors will always keep us on the edge of an episode - that's why we have medication to manage so the illness doesn't act out. 

By all means, I agree with OP - I believe big pharma pushes drugs unnecessarily. But I don't believe mental illnesses such as ours are diagnosed and prescribed medications enough/as much as is actually necessary. Sure, it sucks having to proverbially throw darts at a board till you get a bullseye, in terms of medication. It happens with an illness that's not as thoroughly researched or accepted BUT:

If you're taking prescribed medication and you're feeling better and in charge of your life don't go off of it!! Unless a professional says so you shouldn't.

Edit to add: holistic approaches are well and good, and can help when you feel medication isn't sufficient, that's the point of the holistic approach. The point of therapists is to learn new ways to cope with the disease, the point of psychiatrists are to give you the chemical adjustment needed - to get you to where you need to be to function at the minimum dose necessary. If you feel your psych is pushing too many meds consult with another for a second opinion if they don't listen.

Long term illness equals long-term lifestyle changes and in this day and age not everyone can afford or manage the dedication needed for that. Because like I said external factors affect us so greatly as well, and life happens. We need to take care of ourselves so that when it comes time that an episode is really bad, we don't have to be in the adjustment stage of new medications, we're in the coping stage."

And I mean yes everyone can see thats what it is but it bugs me that it took a flyer incident for the black orgs to get what they've been requesting for years, and that they think two emails about a rape covers it all and then the flyer incident can cover all diversity and claim inclusive and safe spaces. Without actually giving any info about the rape, etc.

They just want to look good. And I say that because I'm also fucking pissed off at the fact that the second eastwood parking structure is being built during a peak sem when they should've been doing that instead of the fucking million dollar walkway and fucking courtyard in front of the library.

I have such a problem with that walkway. It's all for show and making the school look good, but when it comes time for other classrooms or updating old buildings it doesn't seem like they lift a fucking finger (oh except renaming university hall to Gordon hall.)

PMDD,f6v86p1,t3_dt4sx2,1573179163.0,"Honestly, I took a year and a half off of school so I'm a fifth year but it's technically been six years since I first started college. My family hated it but the most important thing to remember is that YOU are the one graduating and YOU are the one experiencing the course load on top of PMDD symptoms so only YOU should dictate when you graduate. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, and hopefully your mom will understand that in order for you to graduate SUCCESSFULLY and not barely passing you have to be in your best condition. Now that I've got this somewhat under control (amongst other issues) I'm realizing that it doesn't matter when you graduate. Now I'm on the path to graduating within a year but I may take longer because I may be able to do a minor if I stay another half year or so. It works out in the end!

Have you signed up for your schools disability services? This definitely counts as a disability and my DSS has been amazing at helping me out. They have notetaking services for weeks I may miss, teachers are so much more understanding about the situation if you tell them you're with DSS (no guilt over self destructing and trying to make it better by asking for a second chance!!!) they are usually very good about makeups.

It's in the same line of thinking as a woman requesting a woman therapist because of past traumas with men.

What an eyeroll. We're all mad at the same system, but being tolerant of a monster is a line none of us should cross. 

He wasn't given a proper sentence. The woman wasn't doing anything wrong in voicing that people were letting him walk around like a free man (cause let's be honest, a man as rich and influential as him with an ankle monitor? we may as well slap a sticker that says ""paid his dues"" on his forehead) and if he felt even an ounce of guilt in that moment then all the better. being outraged let's the people know the system isn't working, that it's NOT okay to keep doing this just because someone's got enough cash on hand to post million dollar bail.

Why is everyone acting like a rapist walking free is normal and okay?"" 

It invalidates the feelings of the victims because it shows us that society views this crime committed against us as nowhere near as serious as we are taking it.

At least...that's how I took it. I know being anywhere near someone who's a rapist would put me out. Both ptsd wise and in the sense of I don't want to be near anyone who would willingly consent to be around this fucker.

Sorry if this sounds like I'm projecting, but to think that if I wanted to go and support friends and family at a comedy or actors club and I'd see a well known rapist in the same place would make me feel unsafe. Not even from the rapist but from the fact that it implies that the establishment and people inside would literally not care if a rape were to happen."

""If you don't want it then what in the hell makes you think I'D want it?""

The devil had a point, DTJ thought, the man pocketed his hands in his suit pants while thinking of what to reply with. It was hard for him, since he could practically feel the annoyance emitting from the Lord of the dead, and he was tired from the constant abuse from the populace. He just wanted to do this exchange so things could be easier for him.

""Okay, so what CAN I get for my soul?""

Did anyone ever paint the devil with a monocle? Where was the god even hiding it? While DTJ thought about it, the devil was flipping through a handbook he'd had Beelzebub make centuries ago, for the lower level demons to reference so they'd get the hang of how to operate things in hell. It made the devil's work so much easier and left him with more time to do with as he pleases. However, that ease with which to operate meant that it was making it easier for him to recruit souls for the deepest parts of hell, and the abundance of souls meant that they were worth far less now than they were before.

It was just too easy to make someone do something so bad.

""Adjusting for inflation...""

""What? What is hell's equivalent for inflation?!""

""Another question like that and I'll skip the soul exchange and send you straight down to give Prometheus' eagle a second meal.""

That shut DJ up quickly, and the devil continued his calculations. 

""So a soul of your caliber, to get it equal to an exchange for immortality and power... I would need..."" The devil shrugged, ""Well, your family is guaranteed down here anyway, but with your connections- let's say... Convince your father to pull out of Syria, and we can call it even.""

""That it? Alright, sounds good to me!""

DTJ knew it'd be easy, but to ensure it'd work maybe he'd ask for Ivanka's help too.

Meanwhile, the devil was making a note to himself: tell Beelzebub to direct summonings to lower level demons, even when it concerned future VIPs. He didn't wanna waste his time on a guaranteed soul any longer."
