funny,foi6ixf,t1_fog64rn,1587779744.0,"Agree with everything you said— except the price. My reduction cost $12k. Still a shit ton (and the best money I ever spent) but not quite 25k! 
Also, definitely should’ve been covered via insurance. But of course it wasn’t ‘medicallly necessary’ despite the obvious physical/mental/emotional strain."
MakeupAddiction,fofxja2,t3_g6tzlo,1587744556.0,Truly gorgeous. Definitely do a stormy weather one as well !
television,foexpjg,t3_g6vp17,1587718491.0,Why only on U.S. Netflix?!? *crying*
LifeProTips,fm3taq4,t3_fsued5,1585736195.0,I love you
politics,fm0rypa,t1_fm0k9f4,1585664983.0,"As if referencing blood quotas is ever a good argument. Blood does not equal culture. Idk about other tribes nearby protesting, but saying a tribe or person isn’t of their culture (“1/64th heritage”) because they’re not ‘pure’ native is racist, ignorant, and just so dated. Let’s move beyond this ‘purity’ obsession please, less we devolve further into nazism."
aww,flrl9f9,t1_flrkdiu,1585422527.0,Can’t believe people are downvoting this. Lots of dog breeder supporters here huh

MakeupAddiction,fla7srt,t3_fne6zk,1584978450.0,Soooo cool
technology,fl9j5kl,t1_fl8y952,1584958116.0,"I understand the dilemma. I live in a country without amazon (& without reliable delivery) so we can very rarely order things online. It makes things so much more difficult, especially during a global pandemic, but is the alternative to blindly support a horrible industry (Amazon) that treats its workers unfairly? I feel like as long as our individual convenience is the ultimate priority, Amazon will continue to deny their workers basic rights. I don’t begrudge you for using Amazon, especially for necessities like pet supplies. I just wish they didn’t have such a strong hold on the market, and therefore face no pressure to improve their workers rights. That’s all I meant. 

Also! Idk if it’ll help in your region (whatever that is), but we called our local pet store to place an order for pick up. They gathered everything we asked for and kept it at the counter for a quick pick up. Obviously it still requires breaking quarantine, but it was a compromise- and we still kept far away from people thankfully :)"
technology,fl70bky,t3_fmrvtn,1584890092.0,What if people stopped buying so much useless shit online that they don’t actually need.
television,fl584zb,t3_fmhhms,1584830672.0,Why isn’t it on Netflix worldwide why
obgyn,fkvdd2o,t3_fkr8g3,1584566932.0,"Sorry for your chronic pain- I know it’s so much worse than people (often even doctors) imagine. I’m not a medical professional so I can’t help diagnose, but wanted to express my sympathies. Hope you find the help you need <3"

AskReddit,fk7117p,t3_fgi5bd,1583924284.0,Kept scrolling but didn’t see any DragRace noms. Definitely give RuPaul’s drag race a try- it’s pure and insane and lovely. And it’s on Netflix
BoJackHorseman,fjxb6jq,t1_fjx1zzn,1583665764.0,Thank you I came here for this- though I definitely thought Bimothy like Jimothy ala the office

EatingDisorders,fiuljdt,t3_exc7dt,1582743693.0,Chiming in to say thanku for sharing<3 Just hearing (reading) that I’m not the only ‘crazy’ person consumed by these thoughts is honestly beyond validating. My entire family has a history with disordered eating (tho unacknowledged). They tried to sweep my ED under the carpet too— if I had access to this sub (& actual therapy) maybe my ED wouldn’t have consumed a decade of my life.
EatingDisorders,fiul68b,t1_fg8c50u,1582743492.0,"Literally same.
Finding some serious comfort in this sub, thanku<3"
