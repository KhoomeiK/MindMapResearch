NintendoSwitchDeals,flhzzai,t1_flgd9c9,1585172682.0,"It is, but I think the Nintendo ones are better in that they look 'and' feel more like the classic SNES controller (for those who are looking for that, and I imagine that's one of the appeals of this controller). While these ones do have analog sticks, the d-pad and button placements make it ergonomically different from the controller it is trying to imitate, so it may look like the SNES controller, but I don't think it will feel like it when it is in your hands, at least not at the level I'd want it to be personally for a product that's meant to appeal as a classic SNES controller with extra functions."

borderlands3,fk5i5h5,t3_fgi0fe,1583880983.0,Just started doing research to see if I should get it and found out there won't be DLC characters. :( Gaige was the only reason I played BL2 as much as I did. BL3's playable characters don't seem all that interesting just by their design.
borderlands3,fk5h9ht,t3_d6z1vk,1583880462.0,"Very. Gaige was the reason I played BL2 as much as I did. In fact, once I picked up Gaige I stopped playing any of the other characters. If the BL3 characters were better designed aesthetically then it'd be a different story, but other than FL4K the rest just kind of look like background characters to me. BL3 on Steam is coming out soon so I am finally doing my research to see if I should get it- it's not looking good."

depression,f603mip,t3_dpl4bu,1572603686.0,"That's almost exactly how it was for me a few years ago, until an opportunity came up for me to move to a different State. I decided to use it as a fresh start to take back control of my life and just be myself, even if it meant being transparently depressed and awkward in front of everyone I talked to. It was uncomfortable and difficult at first, but it got easier as time passed. I am still depressed, but I am also vastly more at peace with myself, and I got to know myself better in the process."

anime,exqrm0q,t1_exqodbb,1566506454.0,"Yeah, there's definitely a fair amount of overlay used here, but only for the fire and floating particles.

I am hoping to get it down to a single day by the end of the year. üòÖ But yeah, I did go to school for Animation, but drawing/illustration wise it's just been trial and error.
