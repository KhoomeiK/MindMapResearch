A family of four, definitely use your membership for toilet paper, paper towels, paper plates, napkins, spices, things of those sort. When it comes to food it just depends on what you are getting, if you like the name brand pizza rolls or snack cakes, it is useful for those, but making entire meals out of ingredients there gets expensive because when you just need one, you get one dozen. We live in a family of six and use Aldi and sometimes Walmart for food, and then I bring home the stuff mentioned above from my job, it is mainly playing the dollars and cents game on where has what cheaper, but it has worked for us thus far!
