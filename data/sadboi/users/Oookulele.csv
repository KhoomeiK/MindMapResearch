These days, while the competition for medicine continues to be super high, law has in some cities become a subject you can study with a pretty normal average. I was confused by this initially but now I realise that out of eight people I knew studying law,6 have dropped out. It seems really stressful and competitive. (At least money isn't quite as much of a problem with studies here. Public unis usually costs 300 bucks at most per semester and you can receive  financial state support )

Still, it wasn't until relatively recently when I was already in university that I finally realised that English speakers don't pronounce stuff like the w in wrapper or the p in pterodactyl or psychopath etc etc etc. In German, we pronounce a lot of these silent sounds just fine and somehow that made me overhear the differences.

Here you typically learn how to drive stick. If you choose to learn how to drive in an automatic car at your driver's school that means that you aren't allowed to drive a manual car until you took separate manual driving lessons (and possibly another test but someone more knowledgeable may know better) whereas you may drive automatic with no additional troubles if you take your lessons in a manual car.

She left me money and instructions on what to do if she died or got seriously ill and had to be put down. I was scared that it might happen but she never once made me doubt that she wouldn't blame me if it did and that she knew I loved her dog.

We cried together for a few days.

Now, everybody reacts differently to grieve and what's done is done but I think your friend handled the situation very badly from start to finish.

Admittedly the other two girls look similar but seeing the pictures next to each other I wouldn't have thought that they are the same person. This seems more like one of these situations where I can't tell two characters in a movie apart because they casted two very similar actresses/actors but still know that they are separate people...that happens to everyone,right?"

Gameboy,fp5q71c,t3_gb3ir0,1588337275.0,"A little piece of history. I wish I still had my brother's gameboy he left me when he moved out (for context: I was about three when he moved out and only started really playing with it about two years later. I don't exactly remember when I got my first gameboy of my own, but I must have been in school already and quickly discarded the old gameboy afterwards because I was a stupid kid)"

tumblr,fp5llgu,t1_fp5gczl,1588333582.0,"Sorry,I deleted because I realised that I was rude af and didn't have a great intro to Scottish food due to my work circumstances and that I chose to spend my admittedly small budget on something else usually. 

Though I feel like bread elsewhere is really different from bread here. I think it's this thing that uniquely made me miss home because our bread is typically very different in texture, taste and look to what I could get there. I shouldn't shit all over it though because different is not worse."
tumblr,fp5lc3b,t1_fp5hqdz,1588333352.0,"Deleted because I realised that it was disprespectful to someone else's cuisine. I probably didn't receive the best introduction to Scottish cooking because I worked in a care home. The deal was that we work 14 hours a day and get free lodging and food and pocket money (not a salary because it would have translated to about 70 pennies an hour but we could basically spend it entirely on frivolous stuff because we didn't have to buy food or pay rent so that was very generous). So I should be more grateful that we got the food because they cooked on a very small budget for lots of people but it was basically shepherd's pie twice a week,potatoes and some sort of meat the other two days and then soup the other day for the 5 days/week I worked,with maybe pasta every other week. After leaving I didn't eat potatoes for two years. 

Sorry,that was really rude of me overall. I liked Mac'n'Cheese and was surprisingly okay with Haggis but it was probably my own priorities that made me not try out many more foods on my days off because I usually tried to either save my money or use some on train fare to visit my best friend (at fifty bucks a week the 25 bucks I would spend to visit her in Glasgow would leave me with just enough to be able to decide between going out to eat on a budget or doing another activity- usually we chose the latter to see the country with our limited resources).

Edit:also wanna point out that I did actually have a good time there,food just wasn't my favourite. I think it was mostly from  being homesick"
menwritingwomen,fp57vfg,t3_gb96az,1588319375.0,"Also I know this is a poor point int this conversation maybe but I am a person who had worry about her fertility before and I wish the media would stop telling me that it will be this life-ending tragedy if that ends up being the case. Like my partner and I really want children (not right now but in like a couple of years' time) it's something I wished for all my life and it's something giving me lots of anxiety as is. But being told that it would make me less of a person? That I will be ""a monster"" if that happens to be the case? It's untrue, disrespectful and really triggering all in one. Like I have so many more things that enrichen my life and could be a great source of big-screen drama that I don't want to switch on Netflix for it to tell me that that would be all for nothing if I were to be infertile."
AskReddit,fp56nlq,t3_gb33ag,1588318132.0,"""It's Kind of a Funny Story"". Saw the movie and liked it well enough so I decided to buy the book. I try to think that since it's written from the perspective of a 15 y/o it's realistic to depict him as a bit of a dick but things like referring to a trans woman as ""he/she/it"" (which didn't make it to the movie I would guess because they didn't want to spark a controversy?) really put me off of liking him as a narrator. I was a bit disappointed because I thought it could fall in line (for me personally) with great books like The Perks of Being a Wallflower but alas."

insanepeoplefacebook,fp1ycsa,t1_fp19zdl,1588251072.0,"Yup. I'm German, just about to wrap up my BA in special needs ed and English so my familiarity with the American education system is...limited. 

What I found especially frustrating was these four or five theories arguing what develops first about number awareness and it was like this really miniscule stuff. E.g. one of them said counting backwards is really hard so children learn it last or second-to last and another said no, they can learn it really early on. Also,some of them have five stages and the other has four levels and the other three steps to explain their model and I tried to remember it for my oral exam (quite possibly in different configurations and quantities, just illustrating what my problem was here). Drove me insane."

insanepeoplefacebook,fp19235,t1_fp0wbje,1588227940.0,"I had a seminar in uni last semester where we discussed when researchers think children develop certain prerequisites to later acquiring competencies for maths. Object permanence and whether they can register change in quantities are part of the acquisition process and they tried that even with very small children (toddlers, infants). 

So, with very small children they would show them a certain number of new objects and let them look at it until they got used to it and didn't stare at it very intensely anymore. Then, they covered the objects,added one and showed the children again and apparently they would look with renewed interest which the researchers took to prove that they could perceive the change in quantities. Though there seems to be a lot of back and forth what develops when in children. It was frustrating to memorize a lot of different theories at what age they can do what."
