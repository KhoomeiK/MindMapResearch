Your choice to hunt was an ethical one. Your choice to terrorize and kill the animals yourself is a direct reflection of just how self aware you really are and how far you're willing to go to take matters into your own hands to be fed and satiated.

The tragedy is meat as a consumer product. And artificial insemination as some poor schmuck's day job. It's out of sight and clouded in mythology."

If the millennials were graduating with no debt but all else held constant, the US would be in middle of a quiet, bourgeois type revolution. Millenials would be buying out politicians to compete with the status quo. Their disposable income would be the new fuel of our capitalist society's soul.
