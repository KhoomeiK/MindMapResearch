unpopularkpopopinions,fr4odn0,t3_gminsw,1589893452.0,And I really fucking hate the Korean government for that reason...If they actually drop the names which I doubt they will and someone I actually respect is on there I'm dropping kpop as a whole.
MadeMeSmile,fqqjgom,t3_gk8bk4,1589566587.0,"I actually did something like this once. I was at a Palestinian/Muslim rally and these Zionist protesters were there so I took a selfie of myself behind them w/ the middle finger, LMAO."
kpopthoughts,fqmv1nb,t3_gjs22l,1589484000.0,"There were people saying he meant to say a word that means ""omnipresent"" or something, but did it seem very sarcastic to anyone else? The fact one of them said ""Don't cry"" and the way Haechan reacted...yeah no. Even if it was really a ""mistake"" why did they find it SO funny that he said a slur?"
kpoprants,fqmu540,t3_gjq2lz,1589483571.0,I think the lighthearted jokes about them being married or whatever is fine but...yeah people really take it too far to the point where it's basically sexual harassment.
kpoprants,fqlknyi,t3_gjjwyv,1589460516.0,"As an autistic person, I agree 100%. If it was just a mispronunciation he and the rest of them shouldn't have laughed. With the way he hesitated you can tell he was probably intending to say that word. And the fact Haechan looks so uncomfortable with it says a lot. He's a grown man, Korea isn't some isolated island in the middle of nowhere...he would know it's wrong."
unpopularkpopopinions,fqjju11,t3_gj87up,1589410962.0,"HOLY SHIT I am SO GLAD someone has the exact same opinion as me on this. Psycho is probably their most basic and boring song to date, which is also probably why it became so popular. Rookie is one of my favorite title tracks by them if not my favorite. It's so fun and funky, I have no idea why people hate it."

unpopularkpopopinions,fqfl8p1,t3_giht6o,1589326918.0,Upvoted because WOW this is unpopular. Is it weird that I never thought of this song as a ballad? I feel like ballads are mostly instrumental and etc. Either way it's probably one of my favorite BTS title tracks.
kpopthoughts,fqdj2sy,t1_fqbu0cy,1589290749.0,"I saw a large amount of the things you're describing. I'm so sorry that had to go down. I don't believe we should make death threats over pop music of all fucking things, it's immature. All I said regarding them was that I hoped BigHit would see this and they would get sued, rightfully so. And yeah, the double standard for female idols is insane. When big boy groups like EXO or BTS fuck up, it's always like, ""Why don't we just educate them?"", but when it comes to female idols people want to sl/tshame them, call them ugly, harass them and their fans despite the fact they've apologized/grown and etc. If you want to delete your account, you probably should. Stan twitter isn't good for anyone's mental health."
kpopthoughts,fqdipvb,t1_fqc85wt,1589290536.0,"Seriously, one of their pieces of ""evidence"" for believing this was literally just him flirting with a black woman as if that means anything."
kpopthoughts,fqam8hk,t1_fqa6f25,1589221454.0,And those are probably the same people who made THOSE theories about IU and Yoongi's song for the sad clout
kpopthoughts,fqam2lp,t1_fqabb74,1589221374.0,"Wait, what was the Eunwoo situation?"
unpopularkpopopinions,fq3atd3,t3_gfx7v5,1589064613.0,"I'm going to be honest, I do like some of their songs. Their discography is good, but in my opinion, not memorable. Probably the least memorable out of all SM groups in general."
unpopularkpopopinions,fq3ad31,t3_gg4un0,1589064493.0,"I'm gonna have to go with what other people are saying. In BTS's case, we have no idea if they had the ultimate decision in performing there or not. All we know is that Namjoon (I think?) said it was a ""hard decision"" and that Jimin said they would go wherever fans want them to perform (something along of the lines of that). I think it does have a lot to do with KSA/SK relations, since BTS are pretty much the biggest soft power for Korea right now, and it might've been encouraged by the Korean government. I'm not saying I support them 100% on this, because it's very iffy and questionable."
unpopularkpopopinions,fpxs00h,t3_gfpd8l,1588988385.0,"People will yell 'Don't assume their sexualities!' and then aggressively label them as straight, it's funny LMAO"

unpopularkpopopinions,fp6zq6i,t3_gb61o6,1588361438.0,I'm sorry but it sounded like it was made in maybe an hour on Garageband.

depression,foglsif,t3_g76n13,1587754230.0,I think about this all the time. I genuinely wish I had some sort of fucked up trauma to explain why I'm like this.
