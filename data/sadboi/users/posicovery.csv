Food should be neutral as long as you’re eating a mindful amount of it. If you classify foods as “bad” or “junk” you end up restricting them, which makes them forbidden fruit, which makes you crave them so much more than if you just gave yourself permission to eat it mindfully every so often."
EatingDisorderHope,f88tdzk,t3_dzakrj,1574360770.0,"You have to work through that discomfort. The only way you can stop yourself from binging is to eat periodically throughout the day. That binge is your body crying for nutrients because it’s not getting what it needs. When I started eating 3 smaller meals a day with snacks in between it was AMAZING how much less I was obsessed with food. I was keeping myself at a stable level of satiety throughout the day. It’s not easy, but the only real solution is to start eating a satisfying breakfast and lunch"

EatingDisorderHope,f6qarau,t1_f6qakj5,1573073897.0,"I’m a recovering bulimic, and I’m asking if anyone has experience healthily trying to lose weight after recovering from an eating disorder, as opposed to obsessing about it"
EatingDisorderHope,f5r8lar,t1_f5r7wka,1572390025.0,"This person is absolutely right. If possible you should tell your doctor about your eating disorder and ask him to refer you to an eating disorder recovery clinic. I know it’s SO scary, but it’s honestly the best thing you can do for yourself. Eating disorders are one of the most challenging things to kick all on your own and having a community to support you is so helpful. 

Without the proper nutrients your body is breaking down not only your muscles, but also your organs to supply energy to your brain and heart. This can cause a whole host of medical problems. 

It’s so scary to have an ED, but you’re young, and if you work now to start your recovery your body is still at the point in its life where it can bounce back and you’ll probably have no lasting repercussions! I really hope u decide to do the best thing for yourself, and know you have people here supporting you!"
fuckeatingdisorders,f5mh7w2,t1_f57ruqe,1572289858.0,Luckily they’re setting me up with a post recovery team which I’m very grateful for. It’s so hard it’s crazy.
