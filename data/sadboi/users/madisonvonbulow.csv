shameless,fr4dlim,t3_gmfztp,1589884783.0,"I agree. Also Ian went and got himself in jail without Mickey. I like that Ian has shown that bipolar disorder can truly derail your life but wit that being said. She may have been worried that Ian wanting to run away with Mickey was similar to Monica wanting to run away when she was manic. Fiona probably saw that a disruption in Ian's life would become problematic for him and I can understand that being bipolar my self. I love that you posted about this moment because I think about that scene often. The part where she says ""set match to it"" alway sends me chills. The scene forshadows a hurdle ahead and I love it.

On me TV always smelled like actual sweet pipe tobacco, spices vanilla lattes, and a leather chair. It used to be so good but since becoming so popular, I have decided to not repurchase. For days I want that same feel, I use MAC Velvet Teddy. Its TV but with a honey note. It tends to get more compliments and smell a bit yonger."

... But I have a lot of them. I have the Comme Des Garçon Daphne after Daphne Guinness and it reminds me of her and her music including Evening In Space. When I first tried it on I walked into a department store and Rhiannon by Fleetwood Mac was playing and that’s the perfect scent/song combo. 

My Classic Miss Dior reminds me of Ella Fitzgerald. Chanel No5 reminds me of jazz music. Each fragrance for me sets a personality and there’s a story and music behind each one.  I’m also one of those people that associates music and moods with scents so very scent I smell I hear music for."

I wonder if this is actually a bipolar thing and if it is considered a manic or depressed or mixed symptom. 

I can say that I always think about my child hood pre 5th grade when I had my first major depressive episode. I also look back and miss the times when I was more manic as they were little bits of bliss.

I also love CH Price, its more boozy and usually something I would never gravitate to as it is a little too masculine for me but I always get loads of compliments (even the morning after). 

Another one I really like is Frederic Malle's Dries Van Noten. My best friend wears it as well as I had its sorta a powdery sweet vanilla but smells so yummy.

Right now my fav fragrance hiuse is Diptyque and they’re EDPs are around $180USD and while I still think that’s too much, I’m a sucker for them. 

For some reason I’ve found that the most expensive

The Margiela Lipstick On fragrance will probably smell like her entire cosmetics bag but with a sweetness that might be subtle enough for the office yet attractive. I love to wear Lazy Sunday Morning on days where I’m just sitting around the house or hanging out with a few friends. But I originally bought it for school for days when I wanted to smell clean but cozy. 

I personally have had a bunch of Le Labo fragrances and don’t really get the hype for all of them but she might like Another 13. I wanted to like the Baie Rose but it smells like onions to me and Santal 33 has become a fragrance I smell in clubs. I wear the Iris 39 sometimes but it is definitely a mature scent. 

I really like Frederic Malle fragrances. They’re a little up there in price but I think she might like Rose & Cuir. I have a bunch of them and I love them for work/professional settings. I have Bogarde, Dries Van Noten, Eau de Magnolia, French Lover, Geranium Pour Monsieur, Lipstick Rose, Lus Mediterranee, and Portrait ofna Lady and I feel that I can wear all of these from work to the bar or to family events. 

At the end of the day, fragrance is personal and you should get her something you both love together so that it has meaning. My ex and I had our own signature fragrance that we would both wear and spray around the house together. It was Encre Noir."

We went back to his very chic place and drank and talked and I was too embarrassed to ask him so I woke up in the middle of the night, smelling his cologne on me and the sheets, and rifled through his bathroom and went through his Dopp kit and found a bottle of Keihl’s Musk. I immediately pulled the cap off and smelled it and was in heaven. The next day the date ended very bad and I saw him a year later but I smelled him in the restaurant before seeing him. We’re still friends but he moved to LA and Keihl’s reformulated Musk and made it weaker. I still love the fragrance and it still reminds me of him and that silly night.

I got the book back a couple days later with a big ""SEE ME"" on it. Confused but deep inside knowing exactly what must have been the problem, I approached my teacher after class and she told me I was a fabulous writer but then asked me what had happened shaking her head in utter shock.   


I told her that I have a mental illness that sometimes causes me to make mistakes in life and she then asked ""well does this mental illness have a name?"" and I told her, ""I'm bipolar.""  


In shock she exclaimed, ""Really?!?"" and then she asked me if it was a good idea to have told her sooner. I explained that I was nervous and unsure and she began to explain to me that she has asthma which caused a huge problem when she was stuck on a top floor of an office building when a fire broke out. She told me that when people have special accommodations that are needed, they should always speak up. And while I truly feel that that is true, there is still a stigma for us as bipolar people.   


But now that there are resources out there. Is it possible to get special accommodations through the student needs department? I hope school starts to get a little more manageable for you. I became a monster in school because that's when my bipolar really manifested into what it is today."

I usually don’t like celeb men’s fragrances but I was super surprised. It was months ago when I sprayed it and it was cold here in Chicago but it lingered on my sweater and I really thought it smelled way more expensive than it is.  It didn’t stay on my ski though.
fragrance,fnrsu8s,t3_g3cl4v,1587200242.0,"Great collection.... you have two favs of mine!

L’Occitane and the Tobacco Vanille!"
USPS,fnpa6v6,t3_fw5upf,1587141934.0,This happened to me as well. My package has been “in transit” from the LA Distribution center for 5 days now. I’m hoping everything is ok. I ordered an item on eBay that I need to work from home on the 8th and I’m just very antsy over it. Hope everything gets sorted out soon. I ordered two other items from the same area and they were here in no time.
fragrance,fno48lb,t3_g2iefh,1587111475.0,Also... a discontinued one but you might still find it on EBay or something ....   I Love and always get compliments on Juicy Couture Dirty English for men. It smells like booze and a leather jacket.
fragrance,fno4698,t3_g2iefh,1587111406.0,I get so many compliments on it and honestly I would have never thought I’d buy a fragrance like this but I love Carolina Herrera CH Prive for men. It’s a boozy leather fragrance but the dry down can be smelled the next day and i bring out the really booze was of it. Guys and girls always compliment me. I wear it out to the bars with a leather jacket and it smells great.  I also wear MAC cosmetics’ Velvet Teddy which smells just like Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille but with honey and to me has more of a boozy note.
fragrance,fno3wsc,t3_g2hxfo,1587111128.0,"I really like chloe EDP or Roses de chloe. I’m a guy but these smell really nice.

I also like Burberry Brit for men or Lazy Sunday morning by Replica."

fragrance,fno2dw1,t3_g2w4jw,1587109558.0,Also... I’m always looking for slutty fragrance recommendations as not a lot of my fragrances are “slutty”. They tend to be more cozy or elegant.
fragrance,fno2988,t3_g2w4jw,1587109427.0,"Britney Spears Fantasy. It’s super cheap but both men and women say I smell so good and so sexy when I wear it.  I’m a guy but I looove this fragrance.

Also I’ve been told I smell rich and sexy when I wear Tom Ford Black Orchid.

Also I find YSL Black Opium a sexy “club” fragrance.



Spraying Fantasy and ...Cue Britney Spears- Breathe On Me ¸.•*¨*• ♪♫"
USPS,fnnc3h7,t3_g2rzq1,1587088992.0,The same thing happened to me. The package was shipped from San Fransisco (on the 9th)  area to Chicago and it was supposed to be here today (the 16th).  On the 13th it said it was at the LA facility and it was in transit and arriving late. It never arrived and it hasn’t updated. I hope it gets here tomorrow as I need the item to work from home.

fragrance,fn2nx2e,t3_fv11sp,1586596200.0,"I have bottles all over the house. Mainly I keep my favorites on my dresser (as pictured in my profile) buy I keep a lot on my bathroom vanity, the back of my toilet, in bathrooms all over the house, a couple by the door... I’m kinda neurotic and I have so many I want my whole family to use them. 

I do however want these really cool metal cabins yes from ikea. They look like old medical or naval cabinets.

fragrance,fn2n8ik,t3_futmfj,1586595420.0,Wow! Nice collection for being 14! I would say these are mature for you but they’re not 🤣. At least you will smell way more sophisticated than your classmates. Keep up the collection!
fragrance,fn2n5bz,t3_fv7d6c,1586595320.0,Nice collection! These are all pretty solid choices for a college guy. They’re masculine and fresh but have good reputations.

fragrance,fn2mcnv,t3_fveenj,1586594417.0,"Yes! L’Occitane Baux is the best! One of my favorite fragrances of all time. My aunt wears it a lot and it reminds me of her and I worked for L’Occitane for a while and all the people that sprayed Eau de Baux on the tester would say it was too strong and not like it right away and not give
It a change. I love it from wet to dry down."
fragrance,fn2m8f5,t3_fvgrzx,1586594286.0,"Haha yes! I have some pretty pricey ones and I die a little very this they spray them.

I put the cheapies and the ones that I like but can’t wear in all the bathrooms of my house so people spray those. That way they smell nice, the bathroom smells nice, and I can smell that it all smells nice without seeing my paycheck go toward more of the same fragrances."
fragrance,fn2m5gd,t3_fvjmza,1586594194.0,I love budget fragrances!! The Dunhill I’ve heard is super nice and I really like CL Shock. I can’t wear it so I use it as a room spray whenever my straight guy friends come over and they always say my house smells so good!

fragrance,fn2kgqk,t3_fxuz5r,1586592337.0,I wear it all the time. I originally bought it when I went back to college. I was depressed and not a morning person and wanted a fragrance that would make feel clean and comfortable for my 8am photoshop class so I bought this and would spray my clothes and people always complimented me on it. It’s very comforting. I’m a guy and no one ever told me it was feminine as it smells like fresh air and sun kissed skin and sheets.
