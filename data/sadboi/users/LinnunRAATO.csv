We grabbed drinks and carrot cupcakes at a cafe and chatted some small things, whatever came to mind, mostly just enjoying the treats. Afterwards we walked around the mall and held hands! Oh, she was also wearing my scarf because she got cold. Then we went to sit down to rest our poor feet and asked each other some random questions we found online, lol.

After enough rest we went to one last store and found this gosh darn cutest decorative corner with dinosaur plushies and other things- I LOVE dinosaurs! Had to buy one ([pic of it here](https://imgur.com/Imc3PRc)) She also had her eyes on one slightly bigger bear plushie, but couldn't get it. Might have to get it for her if we continue going on dates and stuff! :D

We were getting pretty tired and decided to head home. We took the same train and her stop is just two stations before mine. Hugged and booped each others' noses and she left. Awkward cutenessss!! <3"
