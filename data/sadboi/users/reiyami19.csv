Anxiety,eyn06g1,t1_eymw455,1567226045.0,Thank you and good luck to you too! :)
Anxiety,eymvipc,t1_eymiwvo,1567221321.0,"Aww thank you for letting me know this! Life is hard with this kind of anxiety. I'm really glad that there are people like you who has this kind of fear. 

To answer your questions, I'm not shy haha. More likely, I would prefer to deal things with people to me in perso because I have this content feeling of seeing their true emotions rather than figuring out what's their feeling while doing the message they had sent me. I do over thinking too much and it sucks :( 

Second is yes your correct, I graduated college 1 year ago and I got my first job before even graduating. I've really worked to obtain that position and it's sad that I've lost it.

You're correct, life has been tough and I'm really doing my best to get through with my situation right now. And yours too, let take things slow and reassure to ourselves that we can do this! :)"
Anxiety,eymut3d,t1_eym9t0p,1567220661.0,"Yes that also! And it sucks if you have to respond in a very long message and all you got was 2 words like ""okay"" and ""oh really?"" That's sad :("
Anxiety,eym2xol,t3_cxmibg,1567198154.0,"Maybe if everything is settled down, I suggest you may want to ask him to have a heart-to-heart talk with you . Ask him why does he do that and what makes him think of that or annoyed. Hear his side first and both of you do some adjustments on how to deal with each other when having problems. I understand that they should be the very first person to understand your emotions since he's your partner, but maybe there are some areas he really can't understand that's why it's not of a big deal for him.  Otherwise, if he's just being an asshole of brushing of the issue of his gf having problems then leave him already. Atleast you got the sign that you need there that he don't deserve you."
Anxiety,eym1xle,t3_cxmczs,1567197451.0,I can't sleep right now also
Anxiety,eym1vdx,t3_cxmibg,1567197408.0,Did you tried talking with him on how can he deal with your anxiety?
depression,eylv030,t3_cxbnat,1567192646.0,"Yes. I experience anxiety attacks and thinking ""I should be better of dead"" at random times while doing something normal like working, eating and so on."
