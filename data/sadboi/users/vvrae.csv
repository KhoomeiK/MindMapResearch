SkincareAddiction,fnlbqfp,t3_g1yaqd,1587050714.0,"Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice - seriously I truly appreciate it! I've made a daily log to track the state of my skin AM and PM and how much water I drink. I'm taking bits from all of your comments combined with my own research findings and I'm so excited to experiment. What better time than during quarantine when I can avoid makeup completely and address this issue that's been bothering me for far too long? 

I'm going to follow a new routine for two weeks as an experiment: going to eliminate exfoliators completely, hear me out - I'm going to avoid cleansers for at least 3 days intermittently because I swear my skin was at its best in the past when I wasn't assaulting it with layers of products and constant scrubbing, eliminating my toner completely, drinking appropriate amounts of water and moisturizing lightly with an SPF and HA infused cream. We'll see how I'm looking in 2 weeks and if you guys don't mind I'll share my results! Thank you again! This community is so kind and knowledgeable and I appreciate that immensely."
SkincareAddiction,fnla9r4,t1_fnjzjap,1587049951.0,"I think you're totally right about the toner and I can't believe I'm realizing just now how little water I have been drinking since quarantine began in my state. I used to carry an obnoxious 2.5 liter water bottle with me everywhere and especially at work. I was constantly taking in water. Now that I'm unemployed and spending so much time indoors and eating more than normal (but healthy foods at least lol), I'm drinking almost no water at all. It's one of those super simple things that I should have thought of immediately when addressing my skin and I'm so glad you mentioned it because for some reason I completely overlooked it. Maybe because water is usually something I don't have to think about - I just constantly consumed it so I didn't consider it as a factor until I realized I've been slacking so hard. Thank you for your advice!!!"

Detroit,fkpbfp3,t1_fkncrmr,1584406147.0,"Closing bars and restaurants is a crucial move in our efforts to contain COVID-19. I understand that waking up to find you are now unemployed is absolutely terrifying. I can't imagine what bartenders/servers with children are facing during this time. It's not like we can all sell valuables online because everyone is struggling and I doubt many are shopping for non-essentials. To make matters worse, industry folk with secondary trades are unable to use their fall back skills to bail themselves out because many of those jobs operate in facilities that have also been closed (salons, spas, etc.). 

Please don't misinterpret this as casual disregard for the hardship of others, but you must understand that restaurants are a literal breeding ground for this virus to spread. Large gatherings were banned for a reason, how is it any less damaging to cycle thousands of people through the same dining area? Touching the same surfaces - and I know most establishments are not prepared to properly sanitize against cross contamination.

Yes, this is going to get very stressful and we are all going to learn a new way of survival. It's going to be uncomfortable and bleak, and it's perfectly valid to be upset and scared. I'm not discounting that. But we cannot deny that we are doing what is best for the longterm. Many bars in Detroit had every intention of running regular service for St. Patrick's Day tomorrow. That would have meant hundreds of people getting belligerently drunk in extremely close proximity. Blacking out, slacking on hygiene, vomiting in the streets - all people who are operating under the impression that they are healthy. Someone could easily carry the virus and transmit it to someone else unknowingly. This is why the number of cases are doubling every two days.

I can tell you that I used a public restroom in a Detroit bar two days ago. A woman entered the stall next to me, began muttering to herself because I don't think she knew there was someone else in the bathroom. She finished her business, checked herself out in the mirror and walked out. No washing of hands. I've seen cooks eat with their bare hands and immediately turn around to start preparing food on the line to send out to customers. Obviously most humans care more about their health than these individuals, but the fact is these places are not sterile. This is not business as usual, and we will learn this as the number of cases skyrocket. 

I would urge industry workers to explore employment opportunites such as Shipt, Postmates, Door Dash, grocery stores - but if you are able, maybe take this week off to confirm you are not showing symptoms after spending this last week in our busy restaurants where you may have picked it up. Our relief comes when this ends. It won't come to head if we don't do our part, no matter how uncomfortable.

We must suffer to survive."
Whatcouldgowrong,fk6brzw,t3_fggj8p,1583898080.0,"And this right here folks is a pristine example of the rampant misuse of this sub.

Accidentally opening your sunroof in the winter after heavy snowfall would most definitely warrant a reaction of ""Well, that sucks.""

""What could go wrong"" implies an intent to commit a reckless act or perform a senseless stunt. And that's the entertainment I think most of us get from this sub - watching foolishness take place and the obvious outcomes we all saw coming.

TrueCrime,fk1xxae,t3_ffz3nn,1583789080.0,"I think this photo is bizarre...to say the least.

However, I will say that I worry more about the people who’s idea of justice is praying for someone’s eternal suffering. Reminds me of John Mark Byers practicing his target shots and proudly sharing with the cameraman that he wished the alleged murderers of his child were standing in front of him so he could methodically execute them himself, and the pure joy on his face as he fantasized about their pain.
There’s an episode of Killer Women With Piers Morgan where the parents of a murdered child are interviewed and asked something along the lines of “can you forgive the murderers of your son?”.  The mother essentially says that should could/can (I don’t recall if she’d claimed she’d reached a place of peace yet)...but her husband turns to her with a look on his face that could burn holes in her. He snaps and openly scoffs at her for being able to put her emotions aside. He says he’d like to kill them himself.
I get it. I would never discount anyone for harboring anger toward the person/people who robbed them of a loved one. But I will never be convinced that more death on top of an unjust murder will somehow result in balance. 
Forgiveness is not acceptance of the behavior, it’s making peace with the aftermath."

BipolarReddit,fiuzft1,t3_f9yfxz,1582751036.0,"I live in a city where the go-to hobby is drinking. It’s a city full of bars and people literally spend their days bar hopping. And I’m telling you, they do this every day. I’m Bipolar and although I’m able to drink occasionally when I’m not manic or depressed, I find alcohol induces a weird sort of fake euphoria that feels a lot like my manic episodes. Plus being that alcohol is a depressant, I usually wake up feeling very negative. 

It sucks, because it’s lonely, but I’ve been working to cultivate other hobbies on my own since I no longer desire to spend my time getting intoxicated simply to pass the days. Video games are great because they hold my attention and give me something to work on. I read books but I understand that not everyone enjoys them. I lean toward fiction (a lot of Stephen King) because it’s tantalizing enough that I don’t get distracted. There's also a great sense of accomplishment when you turn that final page and finish a whole ass book. I often start projects and rarely finish them, so activities with a clear conclusion are awesome and great mood booster. Hear me out: jigsaw puzzles are incredible. Didn't think I'd being saying that in 2020 as a 28 year old. 

On my bad days, I come home from work and sit on my phone or watch YouTube videos on my TV until the sun goes down. I've been working on avoiding this behavior because it begins to get so depressing that it honestly triggers a low feeling the next day."

BipolarReddit,fhtvzqs,t1_fhsr640,1581878916.0,"I'm 28 now and I certainly find myself facing both manic and depressive episodes that are downright scary. My current solution is to call my mom haha even if it's just to cry and hear her words of encouragement. I also find it's key to avoid alcohol and weed. Don't get me wrong, I dabble, but substances can be triggering and I like to do whatever I can to cushion the blow of my mood swings. I've heard Lithium provides a great stability, and I've never given that one a shot. Unfortunately, I went through a recent job change, and was given the chance to keep my health insurance I was receiving through work - but at double the rate. I chose to keep only the dental coverage, because I'm going back to school this spring and couldn't factor in the cost of health insurance. So regularly seeing a physician and filling prescriptions is not really an option for me. Isn't it unfortunate that some people have to budget their health? I know some diabetics who struggle to afford their test strips. But I'm open to medicating one day maybe after I finish school and have health insurance again, if I feel the need to."

One day I was rewatching some Seinfeld and noticed that they have the exact same comforter in one of the episodes! Very 80s and it’s reversible!
