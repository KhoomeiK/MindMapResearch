orangetheory,fkm8u61,t1_fkbgjiy,1584323438.0,"Dang why the hate on us short people rowing ? For a fact , I give my all on the rower as a shorty and it‚Äôll never be close to what a 6 foot man next to me can row . When you‚Äôre taller you have more coverage to pull back . Height plays a part of a factor too in running but not as much as rowing does"

orangetheory,fh2j3dl,t3_f16jg2,1581254644.0,"That‚Äôs crappy but I‚Äôm sure my studio would do the same . I will say though that I‚Äôm sure you will keep some of the friends that you had . We have members who quit all the time for awhile and we all keep in touch with them - because you know , sometimes people just can‚Äôt afford to keep going to otf or they have medical issues . Our main head coach is super clicky as well but I‚Äôve done my best to avoid and not get involved with his politics. I will say , do your best to not take it personal and don‚Äôt feel defeated from it ."

After that, my anxiety kicked in and I felt like I couldnt complete a class. Newsflash, I have completed almost 400 classes and never passed out and injured myself (thats the anxiety when it kicks in)."
orangetheory,er22qpe,t1_elcl1td,1560439535.0,"I need to practice this too. I usually go in there as hard as I can , but with going 4-5 days a week it is pretty taxing on my body !"
