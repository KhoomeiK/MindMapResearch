asktransgender,fbcj764,t1_fbchlf8,1576725185.0,Of course! Its amazing seeing you ask for hell so that Ben can be more comfortable at home and in public. It definitely isnt easy without backing from a family and/or friends.
asktransgender,fbcgak3,t3_ecmr1m,1576723201.0,"So most doctors follow the practice of a few months to a year of counseling/therapy with a letter before hormones are started. But in that time being will prescribe the blockers. As for surgery, I've read where some doctors will do surgery on 15 year olds and others wait until the body is a little more mature, science wise, so they're doing the surgery to the body shape that your son will have later in adulthood."
