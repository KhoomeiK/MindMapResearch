The thing that you're trying to feel is basically the accents of each rythym.

Just remember one of those numbers is accented and the other is downbeat and if it is atonal then all you have to learn is how the rythym itself sounds and not the accented notes."

I don't understand, do you not understand that something that requires more people usually means its harder, harder things require more reward.

Actually fuck it, if you can solo a 10 man boss or whatever, without fucking buffs, then sure your greedy fucking ass can have all the loot.

You get buffed and less loot because you need someone to hold your fucking hand.

Diablo,fr2680f,t1_fr25cqv,1589831847.0,"That's why there should be scaling, you just take the mechanics from grs, torments and groups, people still play solo on d3 in fact a good chunk do, but there's more reward for grouping up.

I don't think world bosses should be harder, but should also be a challenge where x amount of people need to do it to be able to kill the world boss.

If your thinking about the how the player might think diablo is weaker than a world boss because you can solo diablo, that's simple, you scale the player up to an x man party and restrict their loot gain.

And you don't restrict it by being locked behind x man party loop drops, you just get less of it, meaning you have to run it more times."

Games can be great for living through historical accuracies such as battles, the way life was, even the geography
.
And really the only other thing would be puzzle games for mathematics, which you wouldn't be analysing them, more just playing but I can also ell you that this already happens to some extent, well it was like that for me before I left school 13 years ago.

The rest of the games as far as I can tell wouldn't have much impact on education unless the game has some unique perspective you cm learn from.

Like you wouldn't teach the horrors of war with call of duty, the game just looks exciting and will send the wrong message"

The insanely rich have multiple large companies, properties, and shit tons in Investments, these investments also pay dividends for being being in part ownership of other companies, dividends for the those who do not know is the company giving you money for partly owning them because of an excess in profits for that dividend period, if people stopped investing the entire world's economy will collapse and go to shit, you won't be able to eat, you won't be able to a home, you won't be able to do shit, this is capitalism, this is the world you have to subscribe to, even if you don't like it.

Just a friendly reminder, you're not alive to work, you work to live, if you want to stop working and persue your passions, you need a pension, you need savings nd most of all, you need a passive income.

There was this artist, I forget her name who put on a exhibition, she had laid out several objects on a table including knives and a gun with one loaded bullet and sign that said ""do what you will with me, if you kill me I will take them blame"" or something similar along those lines, at first it was okay, people did nice things to her but it wasn't long before people tore off her clothes, it wasn't long before people inserted things into het, if I remember correctly she almost had a knife inserted into her vagina, she was cut, beaten, her hair was cut, the whole exhibition broke into a fight not long after someone decided to use the gun, she wasn't killed but she almost was, this is just one example.

Another would be a Derren Brown video on anonymity, he had an audience control this guys life for a day and they could vote on what could happen to him, everyone was laughing it was all nice, but towards they end, they were all voting and laughing at getting the man get hit by a car, he was okay in the end as that scene was staged but all of this was done to prove a point in mob mentality and human depravity.

I could also go on to talk about big companies and governments and how they're deliberatly systematically screwing the people over, but this would be a very long comment.

I could also go on about people filming themselves doing charity for Internet points, there are some that don't but my points still stands. 

I could also go onto talk about how everyone in the UK is clapping for the NHS  to show their support for them instead actually helping them by tactically voting against the tories government instead Bob and Linda didn't like hearing the funny accents from the refugees who live across the road. 

I could also mention how were applauding the fact that a 100 year old world war 2 veteran had to raise 30 million pounds for the NHS because our government wasn't going to do that and how the NHS isn't even going to get that after some companies have taken their share. 

I could also talk bout how selfish everyone is acting during these trying times. 

Humans are inherently evil and will inevitably do evil things if given the option.

There is some good in the world, but that good pales in comparison to all that's evil."

unpopularopinion,fqnanzx,t1_fqlcdeq,1589491519.0,"Those aren't the questions for our fear, our fear stems from the actual fact that some evil woman have lied about being raped, and us men get the rest of entire lives fucking ruined for it and barely any comeuppance for the false accuser.

Some of us men, including myself are shit scared that some woman might regret having sex with us and decide to fucking lie about being raped so we don't pull, or even try to when we go out"
unpopularopinion,fqn9wv4,t1_fqlchmd,1589491150.0,Do we also chip the women who rape too?
unpopularopinion,fqn9pij,t1_fqn8rxs,1589491050.0,"No, you take away your right to have guns for less school shootings.
I appreciate the sarcasm, but you just analogised a victim wearing a condom to prevent rape.

But you also didn't answer my question, do you not think having less victims is a good thing?"
