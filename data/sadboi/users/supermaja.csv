ChronicPain,fr1zq1e,t3_gm15ly,1589828689.0,"Nice to see other researchers here. I would like to offer a few comments.

I have more than one diagnosis that cause chronic pain, and I would have answered some questions differently based on which diagnosis is responsible for it. 

For example, I have chronic migraine, a source of both acute and chronic pain. I also have Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, which can also cause acute and chronic pain. And I have a third diagnosis of lupus, which can also cause acute and chronic pain. 

I’m supposed to treat migraines ASAP to decrease pain severity and duration. So I take meds and lie down ASAP. 

For HEDS, I have pain every day, plus occasional exacerbations and new subluxations. I usually just push through it and only lie down if the pain level is higher, and I don’t medicate unless the pain becomes more severe. 

And for lupus, pain comes with flares, and that pain is severe and tends to last a few days or weeks, along with tremendous fatigue. I might medicate around the clock for this pain.

Many chronic pain patients have comorbidities that complicate pain management, both preventive and acute. E.g., I take preventive meds for chronic pain in general, and I take acute meds for acute exacerbations. So asking us about medicating for pain can actually be a complicated question with different responses in the same patient, and different pain management tactics depending on the etiology of the pain. I would like to see these teased out to break down the differences. 

Also, depression and anxiety are often found in chronic pain patients, but may have existed prior to chronic pain. So the pain isn’t necessarily the cause of depression and anxiety, but pain does increase the length, duration, and severity of depression and anxiety. While it’s sort of chicken-and-egg question, a strong genetic component to depression and anxiety also complicates chronic pain matters.

Also, I’m a former heath communication researcher, and i have found that qualitative items yield greater understanding of health phenomena than quantitative items because you can get some elucidation of why they responded the way they did. Not to say quantitative items are not useful of course, but they provide different insights. For example, quantitative items can tell you how frequent and severe the pain may be, but only qualitative items will find new variables you may not have identified. I find mixed quant + qual methods to be most helpful.

As for disability, while I am disabled, I did not file for disability due to the likelihood they will turn down my application several times before I would get any benefits. In this case, respondents may be equating functional disability with disability benefit status. 

Can you tell I miss my work?"

TrueOffMyChest,fr07j6k,t1_fr03uid,1589786146.0,"Oh yes, it can. I’m sorry your dad behaves that way. When I was 15, my mom married my stepdad, who was quiet but intense with a resting bitch face. 

Out of nowhere he’s shouting in my face because I used his brush (my family had one brush for six kids to use, a “community” brush, so I figured if it’s in the bathroom drawer, I can use it). You would have thought I stole it or something. He shouted, “Don’t use my got-damn brush! It is not your got-damn brush! Get your own got-damn brush!” He was a big guy and it scared the living hell out of me, and for something so minor. I totally understood him not wanting me to use it—no prob—but was that intense blast in my face necessary? A simple “Don’t use my brush” would have sufficed.

These occasional outbursts of his meant I was always wary and never fully comfortable around him. That was really too bad, too. He was hard to figure out, but he was mostly a nice enough man, kind, and good to talk to, as long as we never talked politics. Yikes."
TrueOffMyChest,fr0654a,t1_fr03u28,1589784914.0,"It’s baggage behind the word “fuck” that can mess a kid up. Had she used a different curse word, like “shit,” it wouldn’t be a big deal. Kids know all about poop!

When a person says “fuck” in front of a kid hearing it for the first time, the first question will be something like, “Dad, what does ‘fuck’ mean?”

And now you are put in the situation of either refusing to tell the kid, in which case the kid knows it’s something bad and asks his friends at school, or introducing the idea of sex to a kid who might not be ready for it.

I am not a Puritan by any means. I believe a kid’s first exposure to sex should be entirely educational, using the proper words for body parts and giving an appropriate level of content for their developmental stage. 

My mom was a nurse, and I received her very clinical presentation including anatomically correct illustrations. I was eight years old. I remember being grossed out lol, and I didn’t want to say those words, but I knew my mom was doing it properly, and I really appreciated having that information. Then I tried not to think about it.

I’m also not puritanical about swearing; in fact I love it. I consider myself a connoisseur of cursing. We did our best to not swear in front of the kids, and I know they heard a few curses over the years. My adult kids all swear freely around us, and since they’re adults now, so do we. I guess you could say our family has a fine appreciation for just the right curse word for a given situation. 

But I have been around children all my life, and I think it’s really shitty to force grown-up issues on children. I’m not saying they should never be exposed to these matters; I’m saying let it happen as it happens. Don’t be the asshole who introduces a kid to the sexual world when they’re not ready to learn about it and they could enjoy their innocence just a little longer. They learn it soon enough on the playground anyway. 

The other thing is that swear words really scare some kids. My son would cry if I said “damn it,” and he asked me to please not say bad words. Probably because he knew he wasn’t supposed to say them. Maybe he was worried I would get in trouble myself. Idk. 

But for an adult to drop F-bombs in front of them robs the kid of any innocence that might remain. Sex is a reality that many kids are disturbed by, especially when they’re younger kids. Let’s just let them be kids and keep adult problems for the adults."

AskReddit,fqzyngx,t1_fqzjhif,1589778766.0,No. She shouldn’t be invisible.
TrueOffMyChest,fqyzmh8,t1_fqxda0h,1589757296.0,"So she:

1. Swore in front of his kid. Some people don’t mind this, but as a rule, it’s considered very bad behavior. Yes, they’ve probably heard it already, but how bout we assume they haven’t. Then she becomes the person who exposes this word and all the baggage behind it. Just no. Don’t be an ass.

2. Involved his child in her adult relationship problems. No one should do this to a child, or even an adult. Handle your own damn drama and protect the child from your dysfunction. It’s very stressful and scary to kids to see kind of ugliness. Shame on her. 

3. Violated her boyfriend’s trust. If she goes off like this in such a way, she’s demonstrating her view that her petty issues are more important than the child’s relationship with their father. No. If she can’t trust him to handle such a petty problem, there’s more wrong with the relationship than a misunderstanding over custody arrangements. These things happen. Geez.

4. Did not understand how and why she was wrong. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of how to interact with a child. I wouldn’t want her around my kids for sure. That was a vicious thing to say.

5. Had an outburst over nothing, which suggests she’s pretty immature. Who knows what else she might say or do in front of this kid? She clearly is not considering the needs of the child, only her own needs. Fine. But she shouldn’t be surprised when the BF considers his own need to protect his child from such behavior. 

As the child of divorced parents, a stepchild, and a person whose been married to the same dude for 30 years, I can attest to the awfulness of parents strife. And my parents only raised their voices! They did not engage in arguments in front of us kids, and they did not insult each other. They only argued about behavior, never getting ugly with name calling or anything like that.  But raised voices alone were enough to really scare me at eight years old.

And step relationships are weird. I liked my stepmom, but she treated me far better than she treated her own kids. It was confusing. She would take me to get a cake for dessert almost every time I went there for dinner, but she never did that for her own kids. And she treated her own kids pretty shitty, insulting them in front of me. I felt horrible about it. 

When my stepmom started insulting my dad in front of us, telling jokes at his expense, laughing at him in a taunting way, I felt so bad for my dad. I also stopped liking her at all. You don’t get to do that to my dad and expect me to go along with it. This all happened when I was 12 and it was a terrible thing to be in the middle of.

So while it may seem a little extreme to end the relationship as a response, the comment she made says a lot about the way she behaves under stress. Would you want THAT in your corner? NO WAY. It’s maddening to deal with such behavior when you’re stressed yourself, especially over basically nothing. A lifetime of that would be hell.

I’d rather find someone who may perhaps be upset at such a misunderstanding, but would recognize that it was an irrational feeling over something that was no big deal. No harm, no foul. Mistakes happen!"

What I do that works great for me is an approach similar to exposure therapy for phobias.

When I’m alone and have time to think and something from the past is bugging me, I will let it come to mind and try to recall everything that happened including every detail. (Yes, it sucks to do this.) I have found that sometimes I jumped to a conclusion that wasn’t correct, or was fuzzy on details I thought I was sure of, or that what I said was not so crazy given my age and experience at the time.

Then every time I recall that incident, I again go through all the details. Over time, my horror-cringe decreases a little more. 

I tell myself that everyone makes mistakes, including me. This helps me realize I’m not alone in my mistakes, and I’m comforted that I’m probably not deficient compared to the norm.

I tell myself that what makes me cringe may have made others who were there when it happened respond differently than I did. I have found that to be true of many such cringeworthy incidents. Maybe they felt sympathy for me. Maybe they empathized with me. Maybe they forgot it and never thought of it after it happened. These possible responses from others make me realize I could be torturing myself over something no one else remembers, especially since I can’t change the past.

At this point the only thing left to deal with is how I feel about these past cringe events. Yes, I wiped out in the hallway at school in sixth grade wearing a dress and heels. I felt like a fool. This one was easy to chalk up to childhood experiences. 

The hardest thing for me to put to rest was having a child at age 17. I was a virgin who had sex once, with a condom and only one ovary, and got pregnant. That was really rough. My mistake was right out there in full view. Everyone and their brother had opinions they gave me. Old ladies gave me the stink eye. My favorite teacher told me, “You could have been somebody.”

I got great advice from my mom. She told me to deal with the practical stuff now and when you have the luxury of time and energy to deal with it, you can examine how you feel and process it fully. Great advice! 

By the time I could handle revisiting those awful months of high school while pregnant and motherhood before my high school diploma, I realized I didn’t really care about who thought what anymore. So I had a kid. BFD. I went to college with my kid, so it didn’t hold me back much. And I loved my kid dearly, so I had no regrets there. And I moved to a different city so I never saw those people anymore anyway.

So I protected myself from the cringe by trying not to think about it until I could deconstruct what happened and find out how and where it all went wrong. 

Then I looked for the lessons to be learned from these mistakes, and then I was done with those memories. Yes, they are still there, but over time the emotions fade, and one day you think about it and it no longer has the power to hurt you. Even better, that horrible, humiliating experience becomes a great story that can make you smile when you retell it. And if it never is funny in any way, then just be very glad it’s over with.

During it all, I tried my best to see the humor in these memories. It took me several years before I felt comfortable joking about my teen pregnancy, which I now do all the time. And when your own escapades can make you laugh—even if you’re laughing through pain—then you’ve conquered your demons."

This is different because people’s lives are at stake. I have a PHD in health communication and have studied it extensively. 

When discussing matters involving health communication, we often come across information that is erroneous, exaggerated, incomplete, unverifiable, and/or based on the personal beliefs of people who have little or no experience in the topic they’re discussing.

In general, when people encounter information for the first time, some will believe it and some won’t, whether it’s true or not. This is usually fine and to be expected. 

However when people put out dangerous information that includes serious errors and demonstrably false statements (see Trump, D.), it can cause injury and death. People who lack education and/or knowledge may believe that the source of that info is credible and may use that info in a way that results in harm and/death. This is why health officials are extremely careful about how they present info and what words they use. 

When laypeople venture into professional information and knowledge, without the background to understand the complete picture, they often make mistakes. (See arguments of anti-vaxxers re: Mercury in vaccines.)

We all know examples of this. 

Maybe a patient wanting to learn about their condition ventures into medical research papers misunderstands some information and accepts their personal version rather than delving more deeply into its contextualized meaning to a professional in that field. 

Maybe a car owner reads a manual and a few books and watches YouTube videos and thinks they can build their own car properly, rather than consulting with mechanics and mechanical engineers to do it correctly.

Maybe a banker who is motivated by money decides they don’t like not making money, so he asks his banker friends what they think of the pandemic disease that is currently ravaging their nation. They say doctors are exaggerating the threat (though they themselves may have not seen anyone who is seriously ill from it). They may erroneously decide that if they don’t like the answers they get from actual experts, their own opinion and the opinions of their friends are an appropriate substitution for the professional judgments. 

They are wrong.

All the Googling in the world doesn’t replace in-person formal instruction and professional experience. You have a PHD in another field outside medical science? Good for you! But you’re still not a medical doctor.

I have researched how patients and caregivers  determine the credibility of health information and its sources. Have you?

If you had, you would know that some people do accept disinformation and misinformation from less-than-credible sources, especially if it has face validity (looks or seems at first glance to be “common sense” or “true”). And that erroneous information can cause harm or death if followed.

This is how we get two people who consumed bleach due to Trump’s extremely careless language. You might say, “But they’re idiots if they don’t know better!” So does that mean they deserve to be injured or killed? If so, and we extend the assumption of a lack of knowledge, does that mean kids or less intelligent people who drink bleach deserve to be injured or die? 

You can see that this gets problematic very quickly. 

There are so many things to know in the medical sciences! Facts and understandings of thousands of doctors who performed the past research and laid the groundwork for today’s scientists. And it’s so easy to get it wrong!

So it does truly matter when false and/or erroneous information is presented. 

If you want to get into a discussion about health issues, as an amateur, that’s fine. But don’t be surprised if you get shut down because you lack the necessary knowledge to understand it properly or if you’re talking nonsense or passing on erroneous info that can harm another person’s health and/or life.

If you’re truly interested in a good discussion about the Coronavirus, read what virologists have to say—they’ve been studying viruses all their professional lives. 

If you want to discuss social distancing and other public health tactics and strategies, read what public health professionals have to say—they’ve quietly, successfully prevented disease outbreaks all over the world.

If you want to discuss disease transmission, disease outcomes, read what infectious disease doctors and nurses have to say— they’ve been on the frontlines and have saved lives, while watching others they couldn’t save die.

This is how responsible people discuss health science, issues, and policy. They don’t challenge the knowledge and experience of physicians and researchers who perform the research and treat patients, unless they also have that knowledge and experience themselves. If you do seriously question their research and/or practice, you’d better damn well know all the current science, research literature and evidence, or you will be dismissed from the discussion—as you should be.

If you wanted to invest your money well, would you give it to a prince who is your brother and wants you to reclaim your place as next king?

If you wanted to build a home, would your experience with building a doghouse result in a structurally sound home?

If you are that set on discussing all things Covid, do it responsibly. If you want to spread accurate, verifiable information that has been put out by people who actually understand the science and history behind it and have the credentials to prove it, great! 

But if your idea of credibility includes Trump’s literal disinformation, info that is demonstrably false, or info that can harm or kill others, yeah, it is worse than useless—it can be deadly."

For prevention: wear ONLY cotton underwear. Polyester does not breathe at all, so any sweat just stays there. This creates the perfect place for infections, including yeast, to grow: it’s dark, wet, and warm. And the polyester is a barrier that keeps it all that way. And the little cotton crotch they put in makes things worse because it holds water.

If you get all sweaty, then cool down, and change your clothes. Anything that’s wet. Fungi need wet conditions to grow. Cotton clothing breathes, but it also holds water. So changing into dry clothes is important. 

Also, wash yourself carefully every day. Especially focus on all and any skin folds. Infections often begin in skin folds.

If you’re not bathing daily, use a clean washcloth to wash every day. And make sure you dry yourself completely after washing."

So I use what the vet said: if put a hand flat in their ribcage and you can’t feel the ribs, they’re overweight. If you can feel the ribs but not see them, they’re at a good weight. If you can see the ribs, they’re underweight. This is easy to remember, and our pups are never more than 5 pounds over, if even that. 

Ours never got underweight and, like most labs, will (almost) always eat food if it’s offered."

One is about an individual having attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, and the other is about identification with a group.

Absolutely a person can believe Christian beliefs and still disagree with parts of it. And that person can call themself a Christian. Doesn’t mean she is associated with organized religion. 

I think it’s bad to kill, rape, lie, cheat, take the neighbors wife, and all that stuff. And I have nothing to do with organized religion. I also agree with some parts of the Torah, with some parts of Koran, with some of pagan traditions, with some of the writings of famous and not famous philosophers, and with atheist and free thinkers.

To me, religion is a private matter that I discuss with very few others. So I usually feel it’s none of your beeswax how I feel or what I believe, as long as it doesn’t harm others.

internetparents,fpe489u,t1_fpd5pbl,1588540022.0,"Depression runs in my family, and my grandmother, mother, father, brother, sisters, and children have all been diagnosed with moderate to severe depression. We all now take antidepressants, and we all benefit from them.

My mother, an ER RN, said this: Depression is a well-recognized clinical illness, and it’s not something you can think or wish away. 

It is called a “mental” illness because it affects the mind, but it has other symptoms that are sometimes hard to see. These symptoms include weight gain or loss without trying to gain or lose; insomnia or sleeping too much; mental and physical slowness; headaches; hopelessness; suicidal thoughts or plans; apathy about things you normally care about; lack of personal hygiene care; lack of appetite, or overeating; withdrawal from normal activities, and more.

It is now know that depression is related to inflammation, anxiety, chronic pain, the gut, and the brain. It’s a complex disease, but it’s treatable. 

If you don’t know what to say to your parents, you can try something like this:

“[Parental unit], I don’t feel well. I think I need to see the doctor.”

Oh, what’s wrong honey?

“I have no energy, no appetite/eating too much, can’t sleep/sleeping too much...”

OR

“[Parental unit], I don’t feel well.”

How so, honey?

“I don’t really know. But something is wrong. I can feel it.”

Tell me more about it...

“I don’t feel well, and I don’t know why.”

You don’t have to say, “I’m depressed.” As we all know, sometimes people minimize it. But doctors and nurses tend to take it seriously because it can lead to suicide, especially when left untreated. 

When people understand that it’s not just the patient saying, “I’m depressed” meaning “I’m feeling down”, they are more likely to respond like they would to any illness.

If you don’t feel your parents will respond well, you can always call depression/suicide hotlines. Planned Parenthood provides care aside from reproductive services. 

But maybe give your parents a chance. People surprise me all the time with how cool they actually are versus what I expected. 

Hang in there, honey. There’s always something else you can try to deal with this. I’ve been there, and I return there periodically. As bad as it feels now, it can be treated and you can feel more yourself. Keep reaching out—it’s going to be ok."

AskReddit,fpdwmhg,t1_fpduhrx,1588535707.0,"You’re just starting your adult life, sweetie. Look around at people you admire and ask yourself, what are they doing that I could do too? 

I took this approach when I decided I wanted to be more gracious in social interactions. I knew a few people who were well liked and seemed comfortable with themselves, and I observed them in social interactions to see what people seemed to respond to well. 

Then I tried to do what they did to a certain point. I didn’t do things that I was uncomfortable doing, but I did do things like wearing clothes I feel good and confident in, trying not to interrupt in conversations, expressing interest in others’ interests, getting a great haircut, and being kind to all.

I don’t know that any of this was noticed by anyone, but I noticed that I felt better and more sure of myself the more I tried to emulate my personal “heroes” and their behavior. 

Now I try to include people on the outskirts of the crowd, to encourage them to join the conversation. I look for people like me, who are so concerned about making a good impression that they think way too much about it. I try to make it easy for them to join in. 

I still feel uncomfortable at social gatherings, but now I have a direction to go in. I have an idea of what to say, when, and I can always find others who feel the same. 

There are truly kind people all over the world. I hope to be considered one of them. 😌"
ChronicPain,fpdunak,t3_gcq3hm,1588534576.0,"Like you guys, I’m also a recluse. My family is very good at finding things we can do during quarantine and being productive. I’m good at it too—I just can’t participate the way I would like to. 

I saw this today, and it reflects my philosophy of coping with this life by focusing not on what I feel, but on the reality of what I’m experiencing. I figure I can only do so much to change my reality. But I can definitely change my emotional reaction to these limitations. So I try to think of these limitations realistically and not emotionally. 

I like to think of the feelings of pain and isolation in terms of the weather. Like the weather, any negative feelings about my issues come and go, and I don’t dwell on them. I just let them come, see them for what they are (an emotional response to something that cannot be changed), and let them go. Just like I would not hold on to any negative feelings about the weather. 

This is a core Buddhist philosophy, and it makes a lot of sense. Western researchers also advise us to separate thinking from feeling (rational vs emotional) and focus on accepting reality for what it is and to allow our emotional responses to come, be recognized for what they are, and pass without holding on to them. Easier said than done in my experience, but this is the only thing that has really improved my well being.

unpopularopinion,fpc4ig5,t1_fpbmhqw,1588487339.0,"As a woman who got knocked up as a teen, I was most terrified of my parents kicking me out when I told them I was pregnant. When they didn’t, I felt incredibly relieved because I had just found out and the father took little responsibility. I had had sex once and i was pregnant. I was stunned and terrified. I will never forget that my stepfather was super kind about it. Completely blew me away.

I stayed with my parents and finished high school, got into my first choice university, and graduated with honors. After working the summer while his parents watched the baby, the baby and I moved two hours away from my parents, and I started school. 

My parents made it clear that they were not going to parent my child, which was great bc I didn’t want them to. So I had to go in welfare, something I never imagined would happen. I got a one-bedroom apartment and slept on the floor.

It doesn’t have to be a tragedy for a teen to have a child. I’m 100% in favor of family planning and birth control and sex ed. All that. Go Planned Parenthood! But if a girl does have a baby, she’s going to need help—just like anyone would in such a difficult situation. But that doesn’t automatically mean you’re going to raise the baby. 

The most important thing parents can do to help their kids in this situation is to provide the usual unconditional positive regard (you always love your child) AND straight talk about what it means to be a parent with no job and no money. 

Being a single teen parent is incredibly difficult. I would never choose it. I’m the example: It only too one time for me to get pregnant, the condom broke, I have only one ovary. 

I knew I deserved it. The odds were in my favor, but I played and lost. I knew I was in big trouble. It was the scariest time of my life when I had to figure out how to make it work.

The help I got was fundamental to my success. My parents took the baby for the weekend sometimes, so I could study and do homework. The sperm donor’s parents did the same. 

I completely fail to see the logic of kicking a kid out when they fuck up. I’m coming at this not only as a child who fucked up, but as the mother of a son who was a handful to say the least. 

My son fucked up repeatedly. He has untreated ADHD, and it is a huge challenge for him to keep track of his schedule, manage money, and manage his time. 

But never did I say “get out” when he had no alternative. I did give him deadlines and lectures (didn’t work) and tasks to do, but being homeless is not an option I’m willing to impose.

Why don’t you try not assuming it’s a tragedy. It’s not. Teens get pregnant all the time. Sometimes they even plan it (what are they thinking?). But teens have been having babies for time immemorial. They’re quite capable of providing high quality care to a baby. 

What they don’t have is much life experience. They need your knowledge and guidance and love. They’ll be ok. (I finished my degree in 4.5 years and got my first professional job at 23. And my son has his own kids now and he’s a very good father. Having kids is what forced him to grow up. And he did."
