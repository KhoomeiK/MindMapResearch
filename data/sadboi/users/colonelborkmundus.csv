Your mom and your sister (but mostly your mom) have this super sentimental cake recipe that they shared and developed with your grandma while she was sick. There’s understandably a lot of memories and feelings there, and I can see your mom wanting to keep those memories intact. That’s probably why she shut your wife down when your wife asked for the recipe. 

Sometimes a recipe is just a fucking recipe, and the whole family secret recipe business is just hate keeping bullshit. But in this instance, it sounds like it’s emotional baggage and how your mom has continued to carry on mourning the loss of your grandmother. We all grieve in our own ways. It’s rough business losing a loved one to a degenerative brain disease. Would it be healthier for your mother to share the recipe and pass it along? Yeah, but how she chooses to mourn is her business. Maybe she’ll carry the recipe to her own grave. Maybe not. In her own time, dude.

Cooking,fp6zpx8,t3_gamx78,1588361435.0,"I'm not from the south, but I was thinking about this while I was cooking up a basic and somewhat Asian-influenced variant dirty rice earlier this week -- I found a tub of turkey liver that I picked up at the supermarket however long ago sitting in our freezer, and there was no money in our bank account cuz, y'know, hard pandemic times, and not a whole lot to eat in our house. I keep a tub of birds eye peppers in my freezer, used my last shallot and some very questionable garlic cloves, used Knorr chicken bouillon because that shit is amazing and lasts forever, and added some lime juice towards the end from a sad lime juice bottle. It fed me until I got paid. If this rustles your jimmies because MEH MEH MEH AUTHENTICITY, you adapt and do what you can so you don't starve. *That's the entire point of poverty foods*. 

Dirty rice (or rice dressing, or whatever you want to call it) at its core is a struggle food. At its very basic form, it's offal (chicken liver and/or giblets), rice, pepper, onions. If you're lucky, the holy trinity. Now it's evolved to where there's ground meat, maybe sausage, more seasoning, you can buy a mix in the box, etc.

Poverty foods across different regions and cultures and their evolution have always been fascinating to me. I think they're useful to learn about and keep in your back pocket, especially in times like these, or when you personally fall on hard times. It's good to know how to adapt, feed yourself, and do so in a way that's sustainable and cheap and won't give you like, scurvy.

My mom is from the Philippines (from Bicol specifically), and when my lolo passed away, she made this dish that was basically diced sweet potato mixed in with plain white rice. Might have been salted. She said that he would make it sometime when she was a kid, and it turned into a bit of a comfort food. When I make it, I like to saute the sweet potato in coconut oil until they get a little crispy, then mix it in with the rice, salt liberally, add a splash of coconut vinegar, and add green onion if I have some just to make things fancy. I suspect that the dish the way he made it might have been a holdover from WWII. I know that kamote is stupidly easy to grow and became a survival food during the war. 

Rice porridge can be a poor man's food... or it can be a blank slate and be totally awesome. You can go either way with that one.

I'm guilty of frying up hot dogs, slicing them up, and mixing them up with rice. You can stretch out a package of cheap hot dogs that way. 

My husband and I briefly lived with his family before we got our place. We're in the Midwest. His mother cooks big batches of American goulash, tater tot hot dish (which I just started making at home -- *it is crack*), beef stroganoff from the box. Lots of starches to help stretch out ground beef, and very filling -- what they call ""stick to your ribs"" food."

Where I’m at, there’s a shortage of tests and they’re only testing healthcare workers and their families, plus suspected cases only if you have an exceptionally high fever along with shortness of breath, which I did not have.

JoeBiden,fjiiqh6,t1_fjhd1zq,1583368524.0,"He also proposes a renters tax credit for low income families who make too much money to qualify for Section 8 housing. Similarly, no more than 30% of their income would go towards housing and utilities. That really stood out to me, someone who is absolutely struggling and makes slightly too much to qualify for Section 8 and other assistance programs."
JoeBiden,fjiidhq,t1_fjhd5wr,1583368295.0,"> To get progressive policies passed, you need to reach the magic number of 51.

I think I’m going to steal this from you. It’s a great way to put it for people."

Pete_Buttigieg,fjdxwzr,t3_fcrliq,1583261376.0,"I came across an [interesting comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enough_Sanders_Spam/comments/fcv2vl/sanders_fans_yesterday_were_gonna_burn_your/fjd7v4c/) today in r/Enough_Sanders_Spam about the group psychology of Bernie Bros:

> Has anyone ever psychologically profiled the average Sandernista in terms of splitting--as in, capable only of seeing things in black and white, usually driven by a lack of object constancy/permanency (the idea of other people existing as concrete entities with nuance and depth, who continue to exist with nuance and depth even when not in your presence, and whose image remains fairly stable even with new instances or changes in your mood and perception because you have a grounded concept of them as an individual vs. a projected extension of yourself and your needs).
> 
> Splitting is highly characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder, and of those who adhere to a controlling manipulator with narcissistic personality disorder (cult leader), particularly younger people who are still emotionally developing and have a tendency to see things in black or white absolutes anyway. And Bernouts tend to exhibit all the hallmarks:
> 
> 1.) Issues, people, groups, etc. are 100% good, 100% bad; there is no nuance in between. If you align with all their values but pick a different candidate than theirs despite said candidate having those same values, you are 100% bad because you didn't do what they wanted. If Dear Leader says Actually, Fidel Castro Did Good Things, they're going to rush to completely redefine the Castro regime to be 100% good and you're just an idiot if you don't get why.
> 
> 2.) Everything occurs in a singular moment with no past record. An entire history of bullying, gaslighting behavior stops existing in the now when they want to be aggrieved over said behavior turning back on them, or people flocking away from them in droves. Every incident of bad behavior in their past is a single isolated incident that ignores the cumulative effects of multiple incidents as a whole, minimizing them as one-time things vs. a pattern of behavior. ""Why are they so mad at me/us? We only...""
> 
> 3.) People have no value unless they serve Bernie supporters' immediate needs for gratification.
> 
> 4.) They are never at fault. It's always someone else.
> 
> 5.) Denial of agency to people outside of the in-group, because those people aren't actually people; just figurehead projections to assign traits to and lambast toward a purpose. You see it constantly when someone makes a neutral statement or simply states an opinion or preference, and the ""Oh, then you [entire aggressive list of negative traits, beliefs, and desires that the original speaker neither said nor implied, but is now expected to defend against or be branded as terrible]."" When you lack object constancy it's easy to devalue others because they are literally paper dolls populating a world with you at the center of it, not real people. It's also usually linked to a fragile ego, so you need to reduce anyone and anything that challenges you to a paper doll you can easily rip apart without contest in order to prevent ego collapse once the cognitive dissonance breaks and the challenge to belief-as-identity strikes at the core tenets propping you up.
> 
> 6.) Changing on a dime, and to absolute extremes. From good to bad, from bad to good, 100% of either with nothing in between; if you don't fall in line you are immediately 100% bad even if you had a positive relationship with the Berner before, but if you agree and support you're 100% good with no evaluation of other pertinent matters (*coughJoeRogancough*)--and sometimes they will even graciously offer you the chance to reverse your status from bad to good, if you just obey and do as you're told (demanding Warren's endorsement, Pete's supporters, etc.).
> 
> (and of course I mean figurative you in all instances, whether referring to Berners or anti-Bernie, not op)
> 
> I don't know. Just a thought. One thing that drove me to this sub was watching the aggressively abusive, gaslighting, disturbing Twitter behavior and noting common trends in group psychology, and I guess that tweet brought some of those thoughts to the fore.
