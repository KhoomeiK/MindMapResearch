I was dealing with multiple challenges on many fronts. Also was down with high-grade fever and other symptoms of COVID-19, but I thankfully turned out to be a negative, so it was a pretty terrifying experience (this is my second test for COVID-19 in two months).


Now, I hope you enjoy reading this 'long read' article from the Guardian. It's not the most 'leftist' of newspapers, but I found this article super interesting. It basically talks about the thing we've known all along -- that mutual aid and support IS the way to go and cooperation is more natural to us humans than competition and capitalism.



Lots of love, hugs and solidarity to the comrade reading this right now. I hope to make a longer post soon.

Love, Nat! ❤️"

Cannot agree more with you. Neolibs, right libertarians and the like have hijacked the term 'technology' to their advantage in order to serve their ulterior motives of keeping the status quo alive and going, but as anarchist and leftists, we must realize that true technology needs to be democratic and something that benefits everyone collectively, instead of it helping the ruling class and (to use your beautifully constructed term) capitalistic superstructure make us subservient to them.
