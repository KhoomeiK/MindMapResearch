My dad has quite the same impact towards the people around him. Our family dynamic is fucked up and hell I'm fucked up from it. Im not going to lie that there has been many moments that i thought about his death and how much more peaceful life would be without him around. But it's not our place to wish such things, let the world and nature take over. Focus on yourself and getting better with your life and your future. Take the high road. Do better for yourself and the people around you."
LifeAdvice,fqc89l2,t3_ghgf84,1589252213.0,"in times when i feel stuck, confused and cant figure things out i always try to branch out - taking three steps back to look at things from a different perspective. Things that has worked for me - journalling. Journal when you are feeling weird and try doing that for a week and re read them after - do you see any pattern? Try noting down your activities, food and health intake, your thoughts. what are the patterns there? 

if youre not into journalling, try voice or video journalling. Recently i got into video journalling and rewatched myself (ngl it was a bit weird in the beginning) but i can really see the state i was in clearly through a diff perspective. 

I hope this helps and hope you feel better and figure things out OP :)"
