depression,fbceliz,t1_fbc36py,1576722107.0,"For me, the first 4-6 months were the change. Are you taking care of yourself in other ways too? I started hitting the gym at about the same time as I started the meds. Obviously there's the health benefits, and it's helped to undo years of depression gnawing on me. And after a while, when I started feeling better it gave me something to be proud of when I looked in the mirror.

A lot of life isn't really measurable, or measured in just fuzzy subjective ways. Makes it easy for depression to whisper in your ear that you're useless, that you're a disappointment. All lies of course. So the gym helps because it gives you a metric you can measure: you *know* how much weight you can lift, and if you're pushing yourself to go that weight *will* increase, even if just a little bit. You *know* how far you can run, and if you're pushing yourself to get out and do it the distance - or the speed - *will* increase.

What I did was this: I set up a schedule, I said I was going to go Sat, Sun, Wed, and I figured out a plan that had a mix of cardio, some big core exercises, and some smaller targeted exercises. I committed to go every day I had scheduled without fail for at least 6 weeks. I gave myself permission to cut things from my programme, so long as I did one cardio, one big, one small every single time. I gave myself permission to reschedule after 6 weeks, once the habit was ingrained. I gave myself permission to skip sometimes when I got to 3 months. 

It didn't so much make me happier as it gave me concrete facts that depression couldn't twist or lie about. 

Depression would whisper ""you're useless"" and I could answer ""yeah? I can farmers carry dumbells with the combined weight of my kids, which is enough to carry them out of danger if I need to.""

Depression would snarl ""you're weak"" and I could answer ""I squatted a total of a ton yesterday - if that's still weak I'll add 10kg next time""

Find something concrete - something where the outcomes are undeniable - and use it to beat depression senseless."

depression,fb9v95r,t3_ec8d0r,1576651220.0,"You mean the experience of it, or what the thing itself is?

As for experience, this is something I wrote some time ago to try to express what it feels like when the darkness presses very close:

I'm in a room.

The walls are pitted steel, rust-smeared rivets.

And I fumble through the gloom, searching for the way out. I know it's there - it has to be - but no matter how hard I look it's never there. The walls are unbroken.
 
Sometimes, the gloom deepens‎. The black is crushing. I shiver in the dark, suffocating on my own thoughts.


Sometimes, the room is filled with a searing light. It's blinding, seems to see through me. There is no escape in the confines of the room. I curl into myself, squeeze my eyes tight. Still the light burns me, and I shiver and weep with the shame of my nakedness.

Sometimes, the air is so thick with the reek of my unwashed body, ‎so heavy with exhalation that my chest hurts with the effort to take a breath. My head spins. I stumble, gasping.

Sometimes, the water sluices down: dark, fetid, scummed with evil things that cling and reek.‎ It washes around my ankles, my knees, as I search ever more frantically for the exit. And then it's at my neck and it's everything I can do to keep my head up. It stings my eyes, fills my nose until I choke. And just when I know I just can't, just when my strength is failing and I think it might be easier if I just...

Just then the water pours away somewhere and leaves me gasping and flopping, limbs rubbery and useless. The wet, ragged coughs exhaust me, but in time I rise and begin my search again.

I know some of the rules: I know some of the things that will trigger the punishment‎. I have rituals and rites. I am obsessed. But there is always something else, and I am paralysed by fear of unknowable sins.

In the dark, I am alone. But at times I think I can hear a voice - someone else in this place. A shout, a scream. And then it's gone. And then I find that spot, that perfect hollow in the world that brings me echoes from another cell, and I hear someone whispering in the dark, and I know I am not alone.

It seems I've been here forever, like this is the whole of Creation: nothing forever but me searching for escape from this room.

‎But sometimes - just sometimes - I remember: a warm, pink sun, the wind on my face, dew cold on my bare feet as I run into the dawn.

And then it's gone, and I wonder if it was just a dream."

I really like my counsellor - first one I clicked with ever. We worked up an emergency plan a few sessions ago, so I think I'll be OK, it's just so tiring. Esp as I'm screwing the mask on every day to go to work, and for that matter at home: young kids, wife has no understanding and thinks depression etc is all about wanting attention.

I haven't cut in a long time, but I've hurt myself in other ways. I'm doing pretty well keeping that urge on a leash. But the urge still comes, and so do the thoughts of dying.

Damn. 2 years ago I finally started getting better, and by this time last year I was suddenly aware that there had been something *wrong* basically since I was 19. Years and years and years of being draped in a sticky film of depression just thin enough I didn't realise most of the time.

In theory I'm a successful professional in a high status outward-facing job, no financial worries, married, kids, no physical health issues in the family, etc. But I struggle with self-hate, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and waves of dark, dark depression nearly every day when things are worst. Every day sometimes. I'm on max dose of SSRIs, supplemented with a small dose of anti-psychotics to take if I think the urge to hurt myself is getting beyond my ability to cope. I got a promotion in August, and am looking at another promotion in the next month or two if I make the grade - which everyone seems to think I will, absent a really good external candidate. Kids are happy, healthy, doing well in school and sports. 


No one, but no one I have ever confided in had any clue. I'm just too good at screwing on the mask every day. No one has ever seen me break down in the shower, and if anyone ever heard the things I say to myself when it gets really bad...well, lets say if I said those things to my wife or my kids not only would I feel like a total shitheel but I might actually go to jail.


And yet: everything seems great on the outside, and the only place where things suffer is with my relationship with my wife, since she doesn't understand what's happening, won't listen to my explanations, won't go see my doctor with me to get professional explanations, and thinks me taking pills is just attention whoring.

depression,faizmh1,t3_e9hn93,1576120494.0,"I've tried a few things. Some worked for me, some didn't work that well, some worked for a while but I needed to move on to something else eventually. These are things I've done in my worst periods since 1989:


1. Writing: doggerel poetry, diary, creative descriptions of what it feels like when I feel worst, conversations I wish I'd had, heck even just fiction, fantasies, that sort of thing. I'd carry a small notebook with me everywhere and just write when I needed to.


2. Create: I found a stack of small origami paper (500 sheets of 5cmx5cm I think), and started memorizing patterns. I'd practice a bit with a book, then carry some paper with me everywhere and when I needed to check out because the voices in my head were getting too dark I'd fold, either with some of the origami paper or with squares I tore or cut from paper that was available. At one point my office was littered with cranes and frogs. I've also done filling a page with intricate geometric shapes, knotting string into patterns, etc.


3. Physical sensation: at home, when the pain inside is really intense I'll sometimes take a couple of ice cubes and just squeeze them, crush them in my fist until they start to meld together. The intense cold and the concentration I need to squeeze my absolute hardest pulls me out of my head and refocuses me on the physical sensations.  I've done hand washing (hot water) and hair brushing (slow) as well.

4. Exercise: The whole ""get some exercise, you'll feel better"" got very tired, but I've found treating it as a project or an experiment really helped me. I weight lift, and the process of studying my performance goals and working out my programme, then the physical and mental concentration and coordination needed in the gym, plus the sense of accomplishment when I actually achieved concrete, objective goals that the depression voice couldn't question or explain away - all good for me."
depression,faixb56,t3_e9fu8x,1576118847.0,"I know where you are because I go there too. I've been struggling for a while, and have fought depressive episodes on and off since I was 19.

One thing I learned after my last major crisis, thinking about exactly why I ended up seeking help instead of just dying as I wanted to I realised that for me it was all about control and escape.

I feel trapped by the thoughts, by the self-hate, by the grinding darkness that fills my days when I feel worse. And I feel trapped by my life situation. I feel out of control and powerless. 

The urge to kill myself was a last-ditch desperate attempt to seize some power, to assert some control, and to escape. 

Your diary is a good start, but I found that while writing about what I was feeling helped a lot it also kept me inside my head. What's been helping me more recently is things to help me refocus on my body and physical feelings. For example, I might take a couple of ice cubes and squeeze them as hard as I can in my hand, trying to make them stick together. Or something really complex and physical that requires concentration, like sketching complex geometric doodles or making patterns by tying knots in string, or practicing an origami pattern. 

I also confront the thought ""I want to die"" and reframe it: ""I want to take back power"" or ""I want to make a radical change""

All these things help me to come out of the spiral of depression and get more stable, and they make the voices quieter. I hope these things, or something similar can help you too."
depression,fafdi8q,t3_e6a5qi,1576020068.0,"Hey, you're not a coward. Know how I know? Because I've been right there and I knkw how much courage it takes to even get up everyday when you're feeling that blackness closing in.


I get to the point where I just want it to end, too. In 2017 I had a concrete plan, even. Knew exactly how it would go, figured out how to arrange things so that my family would be provided for. There's no good way, no way that will be easy on people who care about you, but I figured I could do this one last thing for them. But then just a couple of weeks before the date I'd chosen some things happened that pushed me into a vortex that just sucked me so far down that instead of my careful plan I was so desperate to end the pain I was looking at everyday things and getting the urge to just do it. It didn't feel like me, I was so far gone. I was dissociating, and I could tell that there was a chance I'd throw my plan away and just make it all a catastrophe. That's when I went to get emergency help.


I'm still struggling, but I've thought a lot about that time 2 years ago (literally this week 2 years ago) and I've wondered why, since I already planned to die, I was so averse to the idea it might happen in one sudden, disastrous, unplanned mess. I figured it out.


I didn't want that because it meant I wasn't in control. The core problem was control. It's not so much that I wanted to die, but that I wanted to make radical changes - among which was getrimg rid of the pain - but I felt impotent and out of control and because I was so sick and my brain was stuck in the fog of depression literally the only way I could see to take control and make that radical change was to die. 


Right now, that's all you can see. You're in pain, and you want out of the pain. You need change, but you can't see a good way to do it so your mind automatically goes to the desperate options you wouldn't otherwise consider.


To be honest, my counsellor hasn't been that much help directly. But she's been a useful wall to bounce my own thoughts off, and to help me with an outside perspective that highlights when depression is lying to me and distorting my view. Is counselling an option where you are? I had always been sceptical of meds as well, since my first experience long ago was a disaster, but this time around I've found the pills a useful buffer against the worst. It sort of shores me up so my strength is enough to pull myself out of the hole. Have you ever spoken to anyone about medication? Is it an option for you?


I hope you have some kind of help nearby, even if it's just a crisis line. Meanwhile, just remember: you're not a coward and you're not weak. That's depression whispering lies in your ear. You're actually stronger and braver than many healthy just for considering facing this again and again every day. You've been fighting this with your bare hands, but I hope someone can hand you something - even just a stick - and you do much, much better."
depression,f9iu4v6,t1_f9iqjig,1575346057.0,"Thanks - I really needed to hear that today. Funny (/s) story: my counsellor suggested a session with my wife to talk about depression, explain what it's like, what it really is (hint: not your husband being a whiny bitch who needs to man up) and how she might be able to support my recovery at home. They reached out to her at the contact email I gave them when I was in a very risky place. My wife's reaction: delete the email and give me a lecture about wasting money on witchdoctors. That was last weekend, and I have been on the edge since. (in her defence, it seems like she has really serious unmanaged anxiety, and she reacts very badly when things are out of her control or scary - and was brought up in a place where you didn't admit to depression, you just slogged through or maybe jumped in front of a train if it was too much, because hey: going to a doctor and getting help will humiliate your family but suicide? Walk in the park!)

It's hard to say where my depression comes from, but it's been plaguing me for 30 years (actually I suspect it goes back further, but harder to identify the symptoms that far back). Getting a counsellor will help a lot, I'm sure. I had some bad experiences when I had my first serious episode when I was 19 - I was self harming and actively suicidal more than half the days of the week. They put me on something - don't remember what now - but it made me feel like my head was filled with sawdust. The counsellor and I didn't click at all. I skipped out and started working on self-management. It's had ups and downs, but I did OK for a long time. But about 4 years ago I started sliding into that worst place again. Self-harm, suicidal thoughts. Had a plan for Dec 2017, but long story short it got derailed by events that had me actively seeking something UNplanned, which I couldn't bear doing to my family. Finally got on meds and got a counsellor, and it's really helped up until Aug this year. But the biggest thing that helped was definitely looking at myself as a project to get better.

My advice: don't worry about being the best self, just work on being a better self every day. You might not make it to best, but just getting better is huge and something to be proud of by itself."

We started on 5mg and as quickly as possible went up to 10mg. I didn't feel zombie-like at all, and actually once the meds really started working I was feeling a lot more like myself than I had in many years. I was on it for a year , by which time my psychiatric team agreed I was in a good place to resume self-management with counselling for support/monitoring and I tapered off about this time last year. I felt great for ages, and actually had my best year ever at work - but started to crash again in August. I went back on in October, and last week my psychiatrist prescribed aripiprazole liquid as an emergency dose as the negative self-talk, urge to self-harm, and suicidal thoughts were getting very intrusive and hard to defuse. But the Lexapro still doesn't make me groggy or fuzz-headed - my previous experience with meds was back in the early 90s, and omg that was awful. It's why I've been self-managing through my episodes until 2 years ago.

I have suffered from episodes of depression for many years, since my first serious episode when I was 19, but have usually been able to manage it and push through until it passes. About 5 years ago I started sliding into a place I haven't seen since I was 19 and I can't seem to get out.

I'm middle-aged, married, kids, successful educated professional in a high status (locally anyway) job. No financial problems, very little debt at this stage. Own my home. Nothing from the outside looks bad.

But inside I'm hollowed out. It's all rusted gears and rot, like the guts of an antique clock you keep around just fpr show. 

At work, I continue to perform. I still take on the big projects that they think they need me for. I still get results, get compliments, win promotions. At home I screw on the mask for my children. I've tried to tell my wife what's really going on inside me but she doesn't/can't/won't understand. She just tells me I need to go out with friends more and find a fun hobby. Thing is: I do go out with friends, but it exhausts me trying to be sociable when all I want to do some days is die. I *have* hobbies, but I can't enjoy them because they just frustrate me when things are bad and I end up feeling worse.

Not every day is completely bad. Sometimes I can fake it long enough to push through and actually experience some fun, some happiness, but then I need to deal with the crash I know will come after.

But the bad days are really bad. Yesterday I faked it through an important meeting and then locked myself in a meeting room and fought down the sobs for half an hour. Lately self-harm has been back on the table. Sometimes I'll move through hours feeling like I'm trapped in amber or it's all unreal. Totally dissociating, I know.
