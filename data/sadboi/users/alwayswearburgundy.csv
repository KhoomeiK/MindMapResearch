explainlikeimfive,fpgpbt4,t1_fpgip4o,1588607067.0,Okay so they metabolise part of the seminal fluid or protective layer and I would imagine CO2 and water are produced so it makes it less viscous.

explainlikeimfive,fpgghmb,t1_fpgg94g,1588602229.0,So if I get you right the sperm separates from the seminal fluid? It's then the fact it's separated that means it's runnier?
explainlikeimfive,fpgfqao,t1_fpgcz09,1588601790.0,But it's not the fluid being ejaculated that changes the consistency but what has been ejaculated then itself becomes less viscous. I hope that makes sense?
