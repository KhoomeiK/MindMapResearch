Unemployment,fr3micl,t1_fr34g4h,1589860721.0,"A contractor gets to control how and when they work. As an as you set hours needed for someone to complete the work they are an employee and taxes are needed. I managed a nonprofit thing for a bit where I was required to bend some of those rules a bit. But the biggest rule I was told was I couldn't tell my crew when they needed to work. Only what days they couldn't work. Which was 1 day a week. Other than that, they could do their work whenever they wanted and I paid them piecemeal for what they did. I gave 1099s to all my folks. I cut them a check every Friday for what they did the previous 7 days. But I never said the had to meet certain production goals or work between certain hours because that would make them employees. I could only tell them that if they didn't meet certain production goals, the company could choose to go with different contractors. Kind of scummy but unfortunately legal, I think."

I hired just a general criminal defense lawyer and it was 3k unless I went to trial. I told him I needed everything to be completed by April of 2019 so I could deploy with my guard unit. I was offered a few different pleas. One of which would have reduced my Class A DWI to obstruction of highway. That unfortunately took way longer than I had. I went to the MADD panel and a 12 hour class. And plead guilty to Class B DWI. And was sentenced to 8 days confinement with credit for one. My county jail gives almost everyone 2 for 1 credit. I only spent about 30 hours on jail prior to my release. I paid $450 in court costs and my license was only suspended  90 days which was to run concurrent to the DMV suspension and that had already finished up prior to my confinement.
