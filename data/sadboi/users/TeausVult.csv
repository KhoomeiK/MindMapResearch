It's understandable regardless of one's views on homosexuality. The strife accompanying it makes orientation significant to their identities. Top that with modern secular ideologies.

schizophrenia,flmurpi,t3_fpniu8,1585297518.0,"The efforts of my mother to refute it come across as more schizophrenic than I am. Religion helped with the delusions a great deal. My mother believes the disorder was but a temporary case because of this despite continued experiences of paranoia and hallucinations.

She was also the one to give me hell throughout my teenage years for the schizo, as though psychosis wasn't enough. Funny how that works. Neither does she have qualms using MI as gaslighting material or to otherwise point out my nuttiness in comparision to her own.

Stay strong. Trust those with experience in the field."

Christianity,fdqr6rr,t3_emk458,1578673127.0,"19 here, similar situation. Forced out of school in childhood for legal reasons. Treated differently from fellow humans due to communicational difficulties (regardless of perception). Throw bullying and familial abuse in there. Chewed out for inability to comprehend simple concepts. Viewed as the family moron. Feelings of isolation due to not understanding people, nor do they understand me: I don't think like them, process situations like them, talk or even walk like them. Too unstable to work, let alone live alone. Lousy Christian on top of that. Stating these in case you can relate. Learnt to trust God and His promises over time.

Bottom line: You are no less human or undeserving of human rights, regardless of what buttholes tell you. You are worth this life because Jesus died for you, not based on flawed human perception. God won't leave you hanging so long as you trust in His promises and love, nor will you will not fail Him so long as you continue to follow His Way. You are not alone in the world, yourself, or your thoughts: God, Jesus, we, I love you. Doesn't matter whether other people know how to love you correctly compared to those of worthy opinion. God bless, for you were given worth of His blessings. Here should you need to talk."

I grew up Catholic, becoming agnostic around the preteen years. My love for Jesus remained. Developed paranoid schizophrenia within said paranoid, diagnosed at fourteen, overall wreck up to age eighteen. There were goals for sure, just no will to put in the effort. Took quite possibly the most annoying delusion to fess up and say: ""God, I need your help with this."" Poof. Delusion gone. I believed because he was here. There had been prior attempts to convert to no avail. There was always some ulterior motive or unwillingness to commit. Let's chalk it up to not being ready. Fell in and out of it multiple times, but God wasn't finished. 'Twas at that time I became aware of how rotten my flesh was.

Put short: Always believed, couldn't find any reason to commit. Goals have changed along with continued issues with mental health. There natheless is one thing I've learnt: The world is worth as much as you give it.

God bless, my friend."
