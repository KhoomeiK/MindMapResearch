bipolar,f85gjjy,t3_dz5168,1574274772.0,"When i work i can tell it quite good.  
If I'm managing stress well and not overdoing everything then i'm usually in a pretty good place."
bipolar,f82h4na,t3_dymxlr,1574191124.0,I had the same issue and boiled it down to me not being honest with my friends. If you let them know how you work once you get to know them a bit they tend to tolerate the manic or depressive periods more. The true friends will stay no matter what once you are honest with them.
bipolar,f817fc4,t1_f80vqfh,1574153949.0,Thanks for the reply. I now feel more confident that im BP2 and can talk about it and get proper help.
bipolar,f7ypafw,t1_f7y81ja,1574098689.0,"Yeah mixed episode might be what that is, thanks for helping me understand. Need to discuss more with my psychiatrist."
bipolar,f7y2gn9,t3_dy01rj,1574084512.0,"My friend is exactly the same, he has the ability to stop anything he is addicted to. To some extent of course.

While me and my friends struggled with cocaine addiction he simply quit."
bipolar,f7xzra0,t3_dy19f0,1574081993.0,Noodles are pretty cheap and tasty. Can recommend
bipolar,f7xzokh,t3_dxzpi0,1574081918.0,"One of the only things i can enjoy while in the state you describe is listening to some really really sad music. I often say, you gotta get to the bottom to start the climb again."
bipolar,f7xr22h,t1_f7xp2jb,1574070864.0,"Okey, but usually it's a state of a lot of energy. But that energy can be directed towards negative thoughts for example?  

It's been a while since i had a happy state in mania."
bipolar,f7ml4ff,t1_f7mcds5,1573866292.0,Thanks for the encouragement. I have never been able to receive help like this before over the web. But i can actually feel it a bit now
bipolar,f7m3kv7,t1_f7m2yrg,1573853867.0,"I'll add you in my chat list if thats ok. Maybe we can chat more in the future?

I talked to a friend here on reddit that said you can't fail as long as you don't give up and i don't know. Just the way he said it made me less anxious.

Thank you, i now understand you more Adam and can believe what your saying."
bipolar,f7m1zf6,t1_f7m1dj8,1573852799.0,"Well my logical brain can understand and appreciate what you are saying. But to be honest, there is no way you can believe in me more than you just wanting to cheer me up.

But then again, why did i post this in the first place. I ask for help.
And just me realising this makes me cringe a bit but, yeah you are right eventually i will make it probably.

Thanks, hope you can understand what im saying and that im not just asking for attention here even tho... i don't know what im saying..."
bipolar,f7m1j8q,t1_f7m0wdj,1573852501.0,"Sure, but i keep falling into the same patterns. ""ahh yeah, let's just drink a few beers"" ""sure let's just do some cocain"" I don't know what more i can do to get sober? 

whatever, thanks for the support. Hope this anxiety disappears by tomrrow when i wake up."
bipolar,f7il0xr,t1_f7ikqtv,1573761298.0,"Dang that sucks! I'm more of a rapid cycler. Can't imagine being depressed for that long.

Don't know what to tell you, you have probably heard it all. But keep fighting, send me a chat if you want to get anything of your chest, i love to help!"
bipolar,f7hpdam,t3_dw3sth,1573745091.0,"Mixed episodes are the worst and the best at the same time. I feel like i can do a lot of deep thinking during these phases. Perhaps even single out some issues i have with my mental health.  
I also enjoy writing journals when i'm mixed.  
Other than that i usually say a lot of stupid, embarrassing stuff to people when mixed. It's like there's no filter on all of the worst thoughts i have about people, politics etc, it just comes out.

Currently in a mixed phase, i prefer it over depression for sure, i like being hypomanic but i know it's not good for me, so mixed is best of both worlds."
bipolar,f7hoxrp,t3_dw5yth,1573744845.0,Deleted? Send me a PM if you wanna vent with me.

How are you doing right now?"

I have never myself experienced a psychotic episode but i do feel paranoid at times, it sucks. I hope you can find someone you can trust!"
bipolar,f7hnzm6,t3_dw6dfz,1573744345.0,"Addicted to the pain, or perhaps identifying with it?  
I can relate to this, but i'm pretty sure it's the exact same thing that happens when i go back to drugs or alcohol.

For some reason it's that feeling of familiarity and comfort. I think the same applies for your example.

I can get a feeling of arousal when these self harm thoughts comes to mind, thinking of it now it doesn't sound like me at all. But when i'm there it's very real!

Stay strong and try to break these bad habits, it's hard in in the beginning and couldn't say if it's hard after that because the longest i've went without any self harm in 4 years is 2 months.

Some day i will make it all the way tho, and so will you <3
Lots of hugs to you."
bipolar,f7fk0z4,t1_f7ekd98,1573681061.0,"Sounds like you are doing good, i guess you know your signs of mania better than i. From what i read you sound healty! :)"

bipolar,f7ef0kl,t3_dvpvs9,1573655898.0,I haven't had a period for 4 years that i have been productive and not been manic. So every time i'm productive i start taking measures to not trigger it further.
bipolar,f7edp3u,t3_dvjot9,1573654911.0,"Thank you for sharing this, i was not sure this was a bipolar thing, now i feel like at some point in my life i might be able to find something im passionate about.

Hopefully not to long away."
bipolar,f7duw90,t3_dv26jn,1573631156.0,"Yeah I figured. I like it, it feels very personal 2ith your own writing. I think that's why I like it so much. Not that I don't like the other one, but it did not speak so much to me"
bipolar,f7ck07b,t3_dvb29o,1573593922.0,"I'm like this right now, I have been hypomanic for a few days and now it's at the peak and also the worst in terms of tolerating people. It's probably more like a mixed episode now that I think of it.

I try to communicate with the people that I like what's going on or try to say sorry after ive done or said something bad to them."
bipolar,f7cj27q,t3_dvdb64,1573593338.0,"Happens for me on depression episodes and also mixed. It's much worse on mixed episodes for me.

Did not have them 2 months ago, after going to a psychologist it started happening for me. Probably a effect of feelings that I can't handle. Sadness shame etc"
bipolar,f7bqjmi,t3_dv26jn,1573575336.0,I like the say something for some reason.
bipolar,f6sptfn,t1_f6sbbsj,1573138034.0,"Nice to hear that others can relate.  
I also have tried battling it with some unhealthy methods but i will try to put that aside as it might make the fall down to depression a bit lower.  

For me in Hypomania my biggest issues tend to be the bad habbits i have when im manic. Eating, drugs, alcohol, sex etc. It has gone quite some time since i bought something expensive i couldn't afford. But thats probably since i had to manage my drug use.

Thanks for sharing your story it gave some good insights!"
bipolar,f6sp7l8,t1_f6s3z69,1573137784.0,"Sorry, i was unclear in my original text, im also bp2.
I used to enjoy the Hypomania, but now im 4-5 years in and it's starting to get old and pretty exhausting. The main problems for me is that i tend to do drugs and take other decisions that ruin my health in short & long term

I try not to look at bipolar as something i will have to medicate all my life, my goal is to get rid of the underlying problems, let's call them the triggers, and then work from there.

I'm currently visiting both a psychologist and a doctor of psychiatry. They have different views on how to solve it or coop with it, and i like that. It's a sort of experiment on what way will work better for me."
bipolar,f5vvnng,t1_f5v0qjo,1572502258.0,"Well now you are assuming that I could stop smoking the first try or even the seventh. I had real issues with it before I managed to stop.

I also experienced physical issues like body temperature changing, sweating.


Anyways, sorry for calling you a douche. I don't believe that anymore after what you said. But still sounded very easy for you."
bipolar,f5ui6jr,t1_f5uhkqr,1572473774.0,"Great job, I also had tro drop contact with friends. Unfortunately that is probably necessary for most people."
bipolar,f5ui2la,t1_f5u0qy6,1572473703.0,"It's not always that easy. You come across as a douch when you say it like that. I was stuck for 2 years smoking. Only reason I could stop was that I saw my own addicted behavior and also came in contact with police.

Completely dropped all friends that had to do with weed. It's not easy for everyone."
bipolar,f5qmim4,t1_f5qkyd1,1572379487.0,"Yeah, hopefully one day i will be there!

Well best of luck to you, feel free to PM me if you wanna keep talking."
bipolar,f5qgath,t1_f5qc7p8,1572376785.0,"Yeah it's good to have people that care around you, also important that you can trust them. I can't say the same for me right now but im getting there."

bipolar,f5pqamx,t1_f5pos4k,1572365377.0,"Now that you say that, lately i have actually started to experience these feelings of disgust when looking at or thinking about certain food. Also happens when i think about other stuff, like spiders or things i just feel are disgusting in general.

Good that you came to terms that you are bipolar, hope you can find som stability in life to avoid any extreme highs or lows."
bipolar,f5pnwrn,t1_f5pnk85,1572363840.0,"Terminology is fine!

Isn't weight loss one of the symtoms of Mania? Could that maybe be due to some nausea? Im just speculating here :)

Hopefully someone that has had the same experience can give you some more insight hehe"
bipolar,f5pnddj,t1_f5ihdi3,1572363482.0,"I'm the same but can still experience tiredness when i wake up, but after the first cup of coffee it all starts speeding up and there is not stopping it until after midnight."
bipolar,f5pk3ju,t3_donk5j,1572361273.0,"I experienced nausea in my latest hypomanic episode.  
Talked to my mom about it and we realized it was probably gastric catarrh. Got Omeprazol to treat it and it was gone after just 2 days.

Likely not what you experienced but maybe?"
bipolar,f5p1lvt,t3_dom089,1572344533.0,"Thanks, just came out of a mixed episode and this helps me go thorough everything that happened during that period.

Now it's depression time..."
bipolar,f4x1lpw,t3_dlqjyx,1571861653.0,"Awesome!

At a first glance it looks like it's made on a computer. Looking a bit longer and focusing on details you can see the strokes of a human.

This was truly a good time to look at."
depression,f4rh7qm,t1_f4rh1dg,1571767466.0,Thanks for the guidance :) I feel a bit better as well.
depression,f4rh64u,t1_f4rh1dg,1571767449.0,It's inspiring to read this and how you tackle your issues. I can only hope this is where i will be in a few months.
depression,f4rfq7k,t1_f4rf8nr,1571766924.0,"Yeah, i have tried that a few times. I just need to have the discipline to keep doing it. I think i get scared of whats under this feeling of nothing.

I will for sure give it a shot again, just go out in the woods and think. I have at least started this journey and i want to get better."
depression,f4rcs9p,t1_f4rcaid,1571765841.0,"I hope you know as well as me that ""just let it go"" is way way easier to say than apply?

My logical self say that all the time, my emotional self just can't understand that. I have almost no connection with my feelings right now. Sometimes i manage to cry but it's very rare. Real feeling of being happy was a few years ago i felt. Now it's just some fake shit i put on everyday.

I try to work on my self, but just let go will not work right now.
(ps. im not angry, might come across as that)"
depression,f4rb9ay,t1_f4rb1y3,1571765279.0,"You are probably right, unfortunately this was 2 years ago and most of the discussion is gone. I'm not sure how i can move on from it, i realised today that this is very much still in my head and making me feel bad."
depression,f4rae0t,t1_f4r9w9i,1571764964.0,"I brought up a girl issue that i had spoken about a couple of times before. I got heart broken pretty much (This girl was in the same group of frames and was my other best friend). This friend i opened up about this to had a lot of issues himself so probably just became to much. We argued for 2 hours, he yelled i cried and the 3 friend that was there was on my side trying to calm him down.

All and all, we talked about it and ""solved it"" (i put most of the blame on me and apologized) Then we stopped talking, lost my 2 best friends and 10 of my other good friends."
