Hubby was supposed to come home today but now is not coming home until tomorrow. He is helping a friend with kitchen cabinets. They are nice people so I am glad he's doing something good for them.

Of course I freaked out thinking that you know he's out drinking or avoiding me la blah blah. My brain goes from 1 to 100 in like 10 seconds. The more details he shares with me, the less my brain feels in the wrong ones.

He texted me and I was able to calm down after we had a brief discussion. I ate a little took a Xanax and drank a glass of wine."

Anxiety,fodwk2m,t3_g6lnuw,1587691484.0,"You know what, I just lost my job on Monday. My boss was a very hands-off not people person type of manager. He had very little to zero human skills. He never gave me feedback, criticism, nothing. Even though I only worked for him for a year, I really liked my job. I just didn't feel comfortable working for him because I never knew where I stood. Unless you were in trouble for something! But it was a terrible way to be all the time because I was always scared of getting fired.

 Monday they eliminated my position because they have to cut down labor, and as a manager I was a pretty big dollar person. I had no say in the matter, no choice at all, it was a pretty big shock. They sent me an e-mail  because they didn't want me to  wait on coming back when we reopen only to let me go then. So I can understand . 

I can rely on my unemployment for the next few months to help me find a better job, and I'm going to make sure that I work for a manager who actually cares about my growth.

Yes, I only work in retail, nothing really super special at age 41. But I do what I can to support myself and my husband."

It is super annoying that there is no full understanding of uveitis. It is not always tied to something else going on. If you read through the uveitis Reddit board, you will hear some people talking about how they've had it for over 25 years but no actual diagnosis for anything else.

Just talked to your doctor, take eyedrops, everything will be fine."

He just put out a video on the virus and our anxiety and it was extremely helpful. I even wrote down his five recommendations that have been helping him through this.  Here they are in case you don't get a chance to listen...

1. Avoid the statistics oh, those numbers aren't helping you 
2. Avoid the conspiracy theories, it's a waste of your already depleted energy and resources 
3. Stop yourself from falling back into a suffering mindset, you deserve to have a pleasant life and be happy
4. Use this time at home as a personal opportunity to work on things that you haven't made time for, like exercise, nutrition, crafts whatever you have been putting off
5. Make yourself your #1 priority, not saying to NOT take care of your friends and family, make sure you are reaching out via text call video call Etc but take care of yourself right now.

I also texted the text Crisis Line yesterday and they were quite helpful, the text number is #741741 and you put your state in the message."
