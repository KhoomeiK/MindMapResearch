And yeah, I didn't realize that it was a completely new CL ft Doves track until recently. I thought they just put the Cremation Lily song that featured Doves off of his new EP and just threw it on here.

The Reno Z has reviews out and the A91, being new, doesn't and the Reno Z also seems to be a pretty respected device so I just put my order in for it. If I'm missing something, it's probably not anything important and I'm saving $100 so it's no big deal I guess."

I'm pretty sure I heard that Wicca Phase was in Tigers Jaw at one point so I got interested based on that. I listened to the first Tigers Jaw album (not the self titled, 'Belongs to the Dead') a lot during 2016 because Run for Cover had a sale during the middle of the year so I was interested in the sudden change of genre I guess lol.

This happened very late into 2018 and since then I got more into that sound (Bones, etc). I'm not in love with everything the scene puts out (most, really), but I still fucking love Wicca Phase and Doves.

Not saying that the song didn't have an influence, but it is far from the first emo trap track ever conceived or whatever. I think it just elucidates the fact that Fish Narc and Nedarb weren't really influenced by Sesh that much (in Fish Narc's case, he has verbatim said that). In the case of Nedarb though, I do find it more strange that he seemingly wasn't aware of what Bones was doing in 2013 given that I've seen him comment on pretty underground shit on YouTube every now and then but whatever."
