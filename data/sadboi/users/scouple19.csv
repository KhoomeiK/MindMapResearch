stopdrinking,fq8dywo,t3_ghe6vv,1589164040.0,"Sounds like your mom wouldn't have said it of course sober obviously. I think we all can admit weve said things we didn't mean while drinking , you would have to be the judge of that with your mother. As far as drinking again and is it the ""same"" ? No, absolutely not, I was sober along, long time and started back, to me it was much worse as far as the overwhelming cravings and sheer addiction to booze. The effects,the ""buzz"" part of  drinking again ,the release it used to give,the ""warmth"" a shot would give your body so to speak, wasn't there. It was just not mentally satisfying the way it was previously. All aspects were much worse. I do though want to say that  what to were the same, or worse, were the lies, the manipulations, the addicton, cravings and then we say the many things you wouldn't/didn't mean or say sober, to anyone, much less your daughter .
  I hope this makes a little sense and maybe helps. Anyway you slice alcohol, it's a demon we all have faced in our own hell. I hope your going to be ok, and ok with your mom, life's to short,take care , good luck to yall and happy Mother's Day !"
