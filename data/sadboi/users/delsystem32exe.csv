Right now HS senior. Went to a medical high school where we interned at hospitals, Anatomy and Physiology college dual enrollement, like 20% of our class is going to med school programs 7year and i just didn't like it not my thing, so i am not doing medicine....

The only thing you have to think of is the time value of money and student debt.

I am currently working on getting a CCNA so i can work full time 2nd shift in a server/data center for probably 60-70k a year start... Rather spend 400 hours studying for a cert for atodays $ than MCAT for 8 year  time delay of $$$, but this is just personal preference. There is no wrong answer and it depends on you......

i picked a ccna due to bls stats and stuff. This way i can do class in the morning and work the late shift, most jobs dont allow this flexibility cause in network ops are a 24 hour operation... Like imagine if amazon went down at night..... The way i view it the 70k x 4 years is 300k, and thats well worth the extra stress... Rather spent doing whatever college kids do from 3 to 11pm....

Med school is 8 years..... So you have to ""make up"" 70k x 8 = 560k + 10% interest compounded in the S/P index right before you get out the door + an extra 4 years of debt/school maybe 100k-150k so you gotta to make up 700k before you break even...... This applies especially to some trade folks who start making like 60k right out of HS working in an oil rig or something..... Med school will earn more money in the long long run, but the first 10 years of your career you will just be breaking even with the rest of us less ""educated and stressed out folks in med school"" , due to the time value of money, but then hit exponential growth and out take us after that part.... But if you somehow find out you dont want to do medicine, man you are royally screwed cause of the opportunity cost."

Quantum Stuff can relate to free will, as is their uncertainty in all measurements????

Use said laws of physics and science to help give you a very very very macroscopic understanding of the world as opposed to many philosophies which can be more local and microscopic / provincial.

Ok center a 3"" gear hole on a 3/4"" shaft, grab the first ring of 3/4"" size and stack the 4 other rings around it and it will center it out. Now clamp to a table and tack weld then do a complete weld. This system will allow for infinite sizes of rods and gears, as the tapered ends of the rings form a cone and automatically center things....

You can reuse the rings many many times before you might have to print new ones as they might melt or lose tolerance. from welding.... Now if someone sold a ring set made in aluminum, then that would be a business idea to patent...

depression,fpydg3x,t1_fpx41zr,1589001878.0,"Hi.

For me, 17M, I basically haven't had a childhood or any friends or went to any parties or had any typical teenage experiences. It was like i was living on a different planet. I am alone, and always have been, and probably will be for  a long long time

It wasn't my fault actually, its a long story, but basically comes down to environmental factors....

What i try to do is realize that life is suffering.... Look around you, everything is fighting to stay alive. The planet will be engulfed in a billion years by the sun. The heat death of the universe will happen and not even atoms will exist, it will be completely empty.

Whats been killing me lately is regret of my past. I try to remove that regret by taking blame of my self and saying its cause and effect, and i never had any free will, its just determinism. This helps me a little bit. I also try to do is i have learned over a year not to get emotional. I am basically emotionally dull. I do not feel sadness or happiness. I feel just comfortably numb, indifferent. I think its a healthy place to be at, as i would rather be indifferent to emotions than be sad. But i have to pay for that privilege by giving up happiness. So be it for now.... I dont try to force anything like optimism or stuff because you cant force something. It won't work. It has to come about spontaneously and it has to agree with your ideology. What i found liberating is emotional detachment. I basically think that everything is meaningless so i have nothing to lose. We are just people on a big ass space rock in the midst of billions of stars and such... The cosmos doesn;t care and neither will I. I will live my life and if its empty that so be it, if its happy then so be it, if its sad so be it. I will just flow wherever this river takes me. I hope i can be happy, but if it doesnt go there, then so be it."

But in the end, grades are like money. They are material values.... Numbers on a paper, and at least with money you can exchange it in for something..... I just wish parents and kids realized that. The thing is i missed out on friendships mainly i guess because of 50% different school. Like i said, this school is collects kids from the county, so we all live in different towns many miles away. Plus i didn't really fit in with the kids there. The other 20% is grades that i worked hard on but sometimes the juice is not worth the squeeze. And the 30% is probably emotional baggage and miscellaneous. I will also say that you should not forget being a kid, being mature is one thing and helps, but we cannot lose our roots, and intrinsic things and our roots. Consider a work-aholic. Yes they are dedicated to one task, but they lose sight of life and it creates an imbalance and is unhealthy. At the end grades dont even measure intelligence exactly, as intelligence is highly subjective and is hard to measure.... No employer asks to see your HS grades. I just wish i could go back in time and get the experiences of a typical teenager...

I currently am working towards getting myself philosophically set and trying to make sure i understand my past and can accept it and move on, but its tough.... Like i said, your childhood acts kinda as a gateway to the past, something nice to remember and experience, and if its missing, it can be hard to function just like an operating system cant function if you delete part of its system folder. Yes I understand that i have 50 years or whatever and lots of time, but i worry that the past will repeat and that maybe it wont work out... When you are an adult, i think it gets way harder to find friends and its different than childhood friends, because as an adult you have responsibilities and things get in the way....

I dont really know if i will have this opportunity again, but i think the best thing i can do is to just accept it and move forward which is exponentially easier to be said than done.... Regarding the scars. Yes, you are correct, but in the end, things are complicated... It would be nice if it was as simple as that.  I know people in the burn center who were burnt 60% of their entire body, I was burn 10%... Life will be way harder for them. There eyes were sewn shut so that the skin would not scar over.... They will be judged, i am sure its hard to get relationships in their shoes, not to mention the emotional baggage it carries.... Attraction is largely based on appearance, you cant deny that.  Life is not as rosy sometimes but it would be nice if it was.... But overall, you are right that i should be more open and look at the future with more optimism.... The frame of reference thing you said is a good point.

Best luck with your parenting"

teenagers,fpy7rkz,t3_gfu7tw,1588997886.0,"Question: u/Domesticated_dad

I am curious about your thoughts on something.....

Now, here it goes. 17 M  Senior

I have basically sacrificed a lot of my time as a kid and i regret i kinda have messed things up.

See, I had an ok childhood, but the thing is when i went to HS, i tested out of my regular school and went to an elite state run gifted talented magnet school, that has 70 kids / grade. I lost contact with all of them and just began doing the daily grind....

I worked my ass of there for 4 years doing lots of work, 1470 SAT, 92% unweighted gpa, 24 college credits. All honors. Never had a final grade in a class less than an 87, and that was like 3 classes out of my 4 years.  Parents still think i did bad on my SAT and grades (Asian). And i feel i missed out on the teenage experience. Since the school was so small and the environment is way different than a regular high school, I never went to ANY, zero parties. Never went to anyone's house or was invited to anything. I had 0 friends in HS. Most other kids had friends from middle school and stayed in touch or whatever or had their own cliche but in the 70 kids in my grade, i was dealt a bad hand. I have 0 social experiences and stuff that most other teenage kids have and i feel left behind, 0 relationships, 0 friends, etc. Like kids would talk to me and i was well respected and stuff in school, and they enjoyed me i guess, but nothing happened outside of school ever. I ate alone at lunch and mainly did HW or studied for the past 4 years just to attain a number on a sheet of paper which is entirely meaningless. I would trade those grades and numbers and the gifted school i changed into back in for what i gave up in a heart beat. All that stuff is just numbers on a paper and doesn't mean jack...

This has been the cause of a slight existential crisis, along with a few other things, including the fact that one of my hobbies, welding, lead to me being burnt in an accident where my jacket caught on fire, and hospitalized and now i have 3rd degree burns on my chest which are kinda ""ugly"" and i am insecure about them...

Also, yeah in middle and elementary things were okay but not great.

Right now i am going to college, but i am just behind the curve socially, and i am changed emotionally and stuff. I dont really care at this point and embrace the face that life is not fair and can be a drag, and now i dont care about getting friends or relationships, i have given up. But worst is the regret that my high school years just went by and i have no experiences, I am just an empty shell with little on the inside. I sacrificed way too much and was dealt a bad hand of cards and its kinda changed my ideology..... I will never be the same, I will never have experiences that others had but it is what it is.

Regarding therapy. It is an over-used term and frankly, they are expensive and not really that worth while. A good friend or philosophical shift is worth more than a good therapist, and cheaper. I have currently been able to overcome my past by embracing a few different philosophies like nihilism and determinism which basically say that we dont have free will, its cause and effect, and some aspects of life are meaningless, which helps me negate my troubled past. The trouble is that, I am human, and i can't completely let go, and embrace the present with open arms, as hard as i try.... And i know nothing will change that as its like a soldier that came back from war. I am ok, like i am not suicidal, but i am just very pessimistic about things in general, accept for a few things which i enjoy like when i built an electric bicycle that goes 30 mph. Its been hard lately as i am just too serious and i just think i am missing the tools i need to have a happy future.... I can't really live in the present, and i dont know how to enjoy life.... I have a happy mask and stuff and i look normal from an outsiders view, but sometimes its tough on the inside... Usually though it only last a few minutes and i get back to doing what i got to do, but the burden and weight exists in the background. Its just hard to embrace the present when you carry around the past. I recognize it but its not something you can change overnight, and even in the past year, i haven't been able to fix it quite completely yet.

Thanks...."

changemyview,fpxm45w,t1_fpxk2qp,1588985163.0,"Yes i understand compatibility. I think the only good it has is that it upholds society/justice in courts. But because i dont really care much about order and justice, i am strictly determinism.

The large scale of the universe helps me. M 17. I have been through a lot, and i always like to view things from a different lense. Consider a train traveling at 40mph. To the person in the train who throws a ball upwards with 0mph horizontal velocity, but to the observer on the platform it is going 40mph. If i am feeling 0 in the duldrums, i can shift my perspective and level up to 40...

I think the cosmic scale can help put things in check and acts as a buffer to all emotions both good and bad, and allows you to simply end the chemical reaction or thought cascade and just nullify it and allows inner peace... IF the heat death will happen and there is nothing we can do, why am i worrying about xyz, when the heat death is like 100000000000000x more powerful or ""worse"".

&#x200B;

Morality is subjective because the  only objective things are physical laws like the speed of light and f = ma. Morality depends on your frame of reference, and its equations do not hold true in all frames. Physics equations always hold true but morality is not concrete and it is very open to interpretation and very cloudy. We do not know if morality serves the best interests of some special group or its because its always been that way or even if its correct. Therefore, i chose to practice a set of morals just because of my own determinist path and environment....

What makes them special is part of the human condition. I consciously know i am just atoms floating around in a special arrangement and i still chose to assign value and enjoy stuff even though i am just a hunk of matter. I have a lot of emotional baggage and i was able to eliminate most of it through nilhism and stuff, but i still have a lot to work on.... I dont have much friends and didn't really party although i would want to, (caused by environmental factors and deterministm cause and affect not necessarily me) so i spend my free time and value building stuff like i build electric bikes, do stick welding, have a garage workshop, and spend a lot of time learning, i enjoy learning stuff, and am right now working towards a CCNA so i can maybe work full time as a network admin during college making 60k/year and invest that....."
changemyview,fpxikgv,t1_fpxi0c5,1588983292.0,"I dont want to go on and on but here i go again:

I dont believe in free will. I believe everything is the result of cause and effect, aka determinism. Therefore good and evil dont really exist as a criminal or bad thing or etc, you never really had a choice in the matter.... I cant go into extreme detail but consider 500 years ago. We did not have the math to predict E=mc\^2 or the position of planets or financial models for the stocks. Given a million years, we could predict the outcomes of our lives with near certainty given enough information. Therefore, everything in a sense is already pre-disposed, and i cant really fault criminals or heros or stuff...

I believe that nothing matters because of entropy and the universe. Everyday millions of planets die and get engulfed by dying stars. Our planet will die too in a billion years when the sun engulfs it. The atoms will eventually decay into energy too and nothing will be left...

I believe that life has no intrinsic value, and that our lives are organic computers, similar to electrical computers, and that in the future we can simulate our lives given enough data...... But you can give it value if you chose too.

I obviously dont believe in gods or afterlives or anything like that. I think morality is very subjective.... And i dont really despise bad things or like good things or etc, i am kinda indifferent towards most things, except a few genuine interest of mine that i assign value to. but everything else, i assign null value."
changemyview,fpxha7i,t3_gezl7t,1588982625.0,"By definition inflation is caused by quantative easing, in which governments print money, or lower interest rates....

Stimulus checks would not necessarily cause inflation, especially since it was very small..."
changemyview,fpxgk28,t1_fptz82s,1588982256.0,"i would have to disagree. all data follows a normal distribution. One standard deviation is 68%, 2 is 95%, 3 is 99.75%, etc....

Most people arent nilhist because its kind of a very extreme philosophy that rejects a lot of conventional truths. Most people are Christian etc because of the strong influence of church in our society. It doesnt mean that nilhists are wrong or etc..., just they have less public relation campaigns...

I would say nihlists like myself fall into the 2 or 3 standard deviation range..... which means we only make up like .25% or 5% of the population. I will say there will always be people who are ""disaffected"" and others who are well off. You cannot garuntee happiness or success or anything in 100% of the population. I have to say that most people find out about nihlism and such during existential crises, and i think its a valid belief system, and if it works for the individual so be it....."
Life,fpx8kxx,t1_fpilf85,1588977755.0,"quite right. Now its interesting if you examine evil on the basis of free will. If we have free will, then its like, you chose to be evil and the fact that you are not changing that or etc proves that you are evil. Now if free will does not exist, and everything is deterministic, then its harder to tell..... As in deterministic, like an asteroid. Its governed by the laws of cause and effect, and its not really its fault that it smashed into a planet and wiped out the dinosaurs as it has no free will, it can not chose to not do that. Its trajectory was governed by mathematics.... If humans dont have free will, then evil and good gets thrown out the window. Some argue that because humans are basically organic computers as you said, we are also governed by mathematics and simple laws similar to asteroids, but the complexity of those equations and data sets are too  large to analyze and make conjectures about only an advanced civilization would be able to model that. In other words, an advanced civilization would be able to predict our life to an extreme certainty given the equations and data and compute power, similar to how we can predict whether an asteroid will hit out planet with our equations....."

Who is to say that u are making a mistake, what even defines a mistake, its really subjective isn't it. I would say take it easy. I think the hardest mistakes are the ones that are not academic but like ideological mistakes where you regret the past or your personality or your experiences.... I 17M am still working on accepting those mistakes i made and moving forward... But you know, as they say, try not to worry about these academic mistakes, as they only yeild a number at the end of the day or a red letter stamped on a 2 cent sheet of copy paper. Ideological mistakes are the hardest that exist, as they effect your inner self and are very low level...... Good luck."

nihilism,fpuh073,t1_fpo82ms,1588912668.0,"yes thats true but in the end, nothing is really alive... If everything is just matter, and atoms, we can say yes, when the electron transport chain does this and stuff, it can relate some sort of emotion if you have like a billion of these cells, but its still just matter.... Yeah we have consciousness but really who cares. Consider evolution. Yes a snail has some sort of response to stimuli. We are smarter than a snail as we dont only respond to stimuli but have complex thoughts. Now consider, an alien species with like 1000000IQ due to evolutionary selection, there consciouness would be unfathonable and to them, we would be the snail, and the would not care about us at all, they would just step on us like we were snail or insect.... So yeah, conciousness kinda is subjective. To an alien, we are just you know, a snail, and to us, we got like high intelligence and consciouness. So there is so much uncertainty here that you know, you cant make any conjecture that things matter or that caring is some sort of important thing related to conciousness.... 

i think the key idea here from this post is the concept of frame of reference.... not necessarily, showing insecurity of people around you...

Consider a train traveling at 40mph. if you are sitting in the train, you are at 0 mph, but to the observer you are doing 40mph.

Similarly, yes nothing really matters in the scheme of the universe due to its age. The time scales are cosmic, where minuscule day to day stuff that may seem like an eternity and have a lot of importance does not mean much to the universe who acts on scales of billions of years in terms of stars forming and stuff....

I think this post is accurate."

stevens,fpt4i39,t1_fpt3t0d,1588884717.0,"what i am saying is you have to do research....

I am doing CCNA because i might go into networking, example: ip address, routing, switching, ISP route rather than the developer route like coding applications, or web stacks, or databases.... So i reasearched and CCNA is the industry standard for this as on job listings on monster, indeed all want a CCNA. I dont have any experience and most jobs want that which is why u need to apply to a junior role not a senior or your resume will get thrown out. Since u are going to stevens, you have NYC to find a job which is easy. I am going to RU so i might have to task the 1 hour + commute.... On indeed i see listings that say 1 year experience junior engineer, CCNA preferred not required. I will say i have 0 experience, but a CCNA i have. So they might accept me, and on the listing it says 60-70k salary full time.....

I really dont know much about programming certs or their worth, so use the power of google in this information age. I do know that a lot of ppl go to coding bootcamps and find jobs after so i will say maybe spend 100 hours learning a language and then get a cert on it... IE redhat linux certs or Microsoft Server Certs for server managers, idk programmer certs but they do exist. Or you can just get a server or network cert and do that instead of programming, up 2 u.

&#x200B;

Want basic IT at like 20 dollars an hour. Get a COMPTIA A+ cert... Example and maybe get a security + for extra measure. Each cert costs 300 dollars to take the test, and 1000 for a class. Save the 1000 and just study yourself. You take the tests at a testing center like prometric in an office building....

If you work, you will have no social life, which i never had so meh. But you will have a money advantage. 60 grand x 4 years = 240k head start. Consider u working at 60k/year start, versus your peers at school. Lets say you consistently make 10 grand less than them over the average of your career, because you didnt do well in school do to working and had a bad internship. It would take 24 years for them to break even and make more than you.....

At 24k less that would take 10 years.... Unlikely that you would be at a disadvantage even if u had lower gpa because you would have 4 years experience, meaning you would even start higher then them. So now they are 10 grand or 20 grand start salary below you.... So now it would take 48 years for them to break even to your net worth etc... Now money has a time value, so if you invest those earnings early, you would even have a much higher $$$ because of exponential compounding. plus nobody cares about your school after a few years of working unless u do finance because they are snobbish people, and then get angry at a bunch of retarts on r/wall street bets or r/investing who beat their ass, and when these financiers can barely beat the god dam index... I got into stevens cs but idk i chose rutgers cs. maybe i screwed up idk.

Look at Beurou labor stats for these jobs. I chose CS and stuff eventhough i love engineering because engineering is a slow growth field. The number of engineering jobs are shrinking, and many electricans pipefitters and plumbers make more than civil engineers. The construction workers building the bridge make more $ than the civil engineer bossing them around.... You can look at it yourself, The newyork iron workers union pays 50/hr for an ironworker, garunteed..... To get that 50/hr you need to do a 4 year apprenticeship in which you are paid money to show up and learn.... Its in the dam union contract.... Good luck making 50 an hour as a recent civil engineer grad, in addition to the student debt.... Even if you are a CS student, the local electrician or whatever may be earning more than you. But if you get a CCNA or work during school, which i know is rough, you will earn more then them, due to the time advantage and stuff.... I was gonna apply for this stuff but i missed the deadline and forgot and stuff.....LOL I cant believe corporate america is too cheap to hire a coding intern and pay them pennies to do a complex application,  when they pay the electrician 50 an hour, just to wire outlets when that stuff is so easy and anyone could do it in their sleep.
