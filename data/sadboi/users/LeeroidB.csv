bipolar,fjq0w6h,t1_fjpla6z,1583564947.0,My work knows. Now I don't have to worry about hiding it. They haven't used it against me so far. Only the managers. I find now that they know I don't have waste energy trying to hide it. Now I'm not paranoid about them finding out.

bipolar,fej1wud,t3_epdql9,1579153905.0,"It's a way of life. If you don't know any other lifestyle to compare it to it becomes your way. Up down all around meds madness it's all part of the ride.
