nintendo,fom5ih0,t3_g7vuf0,1587878911.0,I can’t wait to make strangers laugh again and actually be able to see their face light up. Truly something I loved to do for people before this whole thing. I can’t wait 😊
santacruz,fm9fund,t3_ftw04l,1585867877.0,"Realtor here in SF Bay Area, it is. If you pass on his info, I can report him to the association for you, I’m on the committee there."
basketballcards,f6pgi28,t1_f6oxmr7,1573055829.0,What’re those? I’m so ignorant when it comes to cards haha
basketballcards,f6jhlza,t3_drl2kp,1572894845.0,"Dude, thank you so much! I’ve been researching like crazy. We could liquidate the whole chest and make a pretty penny, but now I’m kind of getting into the card culture with all this research. What’s happening to me 😜"
basketballcards,f6jhadm,t1_f6jgblh,1572894704.0,"PM your email. I’ll shoot you some when I get them. We have all of the Johnson’s, Birds, etc from 80-90 as well. I’m trying to see how much they’re all going for. I’m going to sell all of the cards :)"
basketballcards,f6j6hiy,t1_f6j5lbs,1572889912.0,"Okay, I’ll have to check it out. We have a few that are worth some according to eBay."
realtors,f2459my,t1_f2457ga,1569945133.0,That clarifies a lot. Thank you :)
realtors,f244wzk,t1_f244snt,1569944952.0,"Yeah, and the woman I had a meeting with yesterday serves on the state board. So, I think it’d work out. Do you find that clients take you a little more seriously with the title?"
realtors,f244mer,t1_f244f2b,1569944794.0,"No, I won’t. I guess it’d be good for title and such, and that may eventually lead to future business. I’m already on the committee, so it’s not a huge loss because I’m already involved."
bipolar,f1ynca4,t1_f1d665y,1569820133.0,"Agreed! Things are looking up now. Just passed some extremely important certifications that’ll advance my career. Funny how the depression doesn’t always lift, but we learn to fight it more effectively."
bipolar,f1cxjhi,t1_f1csk44,1569368432.0,Same here! Going through a rough patch and this cracked me up 😂
SanJose,ezuc8uj,t3_d1xbbo,1568149359.0,"I have a lot of film experience in LA, NYC, and the like. I want in! Shoot me a DM."
bipolar,ezkzgs9,t3_d1cg18,1567969191.0,"I always had this weird connection to windows. In fact, I always ensure that I have large windows in the places I live, they always reminded me of a world out there I could enjoy, a portal to a LITERAL world. I say that, because I hope you find hope like I did when I looked out a similar window. Many pills, suicide attempts, and you know all the other jazz, and now I’m writing this by my window in a place I never thought I’d live. I’m just now finishing withdrawal from a psych drug I never thought I’d be able to stop. I have my dream job, and the life psychs told me I couldn’t have. I feel happier, healthier, and more able to be me than ever before. It took many windows, and a lot of hope, but I made it here. You can, too. I never thought I’d be here.

Recover well, and remember that the sun setting is a gentle nod toward a new day that’s entirely different ❤️"
bipolar,ezc1igu,t3_czwi04,1567828493.0,"My god, you’re a lifesaver. Why do you want to come off of lamictal?"
bipolar,ez9y939,t1_ez9gxgj,1567791688.0,"So, this is Day 2. 150mg daily for over a year. I just feel a kind of nervous energy but nothing too insane. My fuse is a little shorter, but that’s hard to identify in terms of medical stuff, because I’m a fairly high stress person. When did you start feeling that way? 

I’ve read some accounts that people feel a lot better after a week."
bipolar,ez3cbko,t1_ez3c36i,1567664657.0,"I was able to take a 75mg tab earlier, but I generally take 150mg daily. I feel kind of foggy, and my head feels slightly pressurized. It isn’t too much, but it’s uncomfortable, if that makes sense. I’m worried about how I’ll feel tomorrow."
bipolar,ez3bul2,t1_ez3b8xy,1567664422.0,"No, I moved states, and I decided I wanted to quit. I failed to do so, but now my pharmacy hasn’t been able to supply it to me. The reason is due to my psychiatric care in another state. It was truly dismal. For example, they’ve faxed my psych 3 times and haven’t received a response."
bipolar,ez34wnm,t3_czlj0g,1567660971.0,Wow. That’s amazing. Bravo.
bipolar,eyrp3as,t3_cyaiaa,1567374444.0,"You felt like a zombie, I felt mummified. I think that’s more accurate on all of our fronts, either description is horrendous."
bipolar,extna9u,t1_extms8p,1566571687.0,"See, that’s what I’m still worried about. I don’t want the depression to come back. Honestly, I don’t want any episodes to come back, but I truly think it could work for me. Maybe I’ll just try a lower dose for a month, and then I’ll see how I feel since it seems to be a new issue. Thanks, I never thought that I would be, so if I can do it, anyone can. Live those dreams despite this bitch of an illness 💪"
SanJose,evz2n5q,t3_clkooa,1564947445.0,"You’re a little rude for my taste and clearly have no cognizance in relation to how this industry works. Since you wanna insult me, how about this: stop picking on 25 year olds who worked their asses off to get where they are, and because of that, make more money than you do in two years in one. Sorry that makes you bitter. Maybe you should have worked a little harder rather than partying. Oh, how would I know that? I don’t, which is exactly why you shouldn’t call someone you’ve never met ‘scum.’ Truly, people who live to bring other people down are the true scum of society. I work 90+ hours a week, so I have no time for people to say we don’t work hard. You’re just embarrassing yourself with your obstinate ignorance."
SanJose,evwiuhp,t1_evwirta,1564865207.0,Just a polite gesture ;)
realtors,evt2gs3,t1_evskoye,1564761408.0,"Same here, man. Haha I bet your memory serves you extremely well in the field."
realtors,evrvbbs,t1_evrqrpn,1564719640.0,"Okay, did you pay extra for the exam prep materials?"
realtors,evrva0s,t1_evru1ia,1564719608.0,"Okay, that sounds awesome. Yeah, it’s been truly exhilarating. I got to see a property that looked like something out of Narcos. It was so gorgeous. I even made a YouTube video about it. Needless to say, I’m eager to take this crash course and get my license. I’m ready to be in the field. Thanks for your recommendations :)"
realtors,evrmn7q,t1_evrkp0i,1564712398.0,"Thanks so much! Would you recommend that over the Chamberlain Course? It’s 2 days, but I was going to take it soon. 

Luckily, I’m an intern at a fantastic brokerage right now(just placing signs, helping with social media, and the like), so I don’t have to worry about that step."
realtors,evrmhqm,t1_evr6dlx,1564712281.0,Sweet :) I love discussing homes.
realtors,euwjp56,t1_eutvxg5,1564076016.0,"Yeah, there’s a cram course I can take near me, but it may be hard because our budget is strict right now due to investments we’re going to make in the near future."
realtors,eutuost,t3_chfzwt,1564032062.0,"Okay, thank you for your reply. Maybe I’m just overthinking the whole thing. How much is the course?"
realtors,eust1u1,t1_eussljy,1564013295.0,"Haha that’s true. The broker won realtor of the year, and is the president-elect for the Board of Realtors, so I feel extremely blessed :)"
SanJose,etyb9u9,t1_et3x3ys,1563315749.0,All good! Send me your insta in a PM
SanJose,esrfjhu,t1_emybr6u,1562224040.0,"Fashion photographer here. Just moved to SJ for my girlfriend’s job. My friends are in LA & NYC where I generally shoot, so I don’t really know anyone here. I’d be down to hang and chat. I shoot mainly on film as well."
