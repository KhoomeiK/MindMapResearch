It's nice to have something between your fingers when you're out in a club or a bar or drinking or waiting for something/someone or drinking coffee or sitting at beach or being nervous for your first date or listening music or being on a diet or doing your homework, working, having a break, after a heavy meal, after sex... 


The idea of ""A cigarette would be nice right now"" will always be with you. You should be able to admit it. If you want a future where you never have these feelings, I'm afraid nobody can be able to give it to you.


But after some time, I finally can appreciate how amazing for me to stop smoking. I might still have carvings now and then, but I'm proud of myself for stopping it and if someone smokes next to me, the smell of it disgusts me. 


And I feel so powerful. I feel one step ahead from all the smokers. It's just this weird feeling...I don't know how to describe it. You'll understand me soon. Just keep going.

Did you notice that you're not really afraid of any kind of contentment or serious relationship or any kind of positive outcomes? 

You're only afraid of the negative outcomes. For you. Like if things doesn't work out for you and you just leave, it's fine. But you're afraid of the outcome where you're in love and then left heartbroken. 


So you're only considering one of the possible outcomes out of tens of them. You're 18 years old and you should be figured out that it's not how you live your life. Since you're not a time traveller who has options to see different outcomes, you have to choose one and see it till the end, or till whenever you want. 

We always think ""love"" is something we should be able to control. Just because...we choose who we love? Well yes but you also choose where to study and you go to school every day. You might have an accident on your way to school and die, that's a possible outcome but it doesn't keep you away from going to school, right? Cuz you know that positive outcome where you graduate and do something you're deeply passionate about. 

So, so what if things doesn't work out? Should it really keep you away from going for it? Should it really keep you away from giving it a try?"
