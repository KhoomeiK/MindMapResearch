Im no esthetician but perhaps I would see how the spray works for like a month, and maybe after that you can consider a salicylic cleanser - just because im not sure if too much chemical exfoliating will be good for your skin. I‚Äôve heard it a lot from estheticians online that you should be using 1 active product at a time (some exceptions) BUT, that was for face skin, not body. Body skin is a bit more tough I believe, so it‚Äôs harder to damage it as compared to the face (in my opinion, might be wrong but it‚Äôs better to be careful anyway). So yeah, up to you ofcourse but maybe just see how the spray goes. I have more faith in the spray because its leave - on as compared to a wash, because of that it would work better 

But I believe salicylic acid might dry you out so a basic body lotion will be good to use too. Preferably one thats not scented so that you dont have to worry about whether ‚Äúfragrance ‚Äú is causing you problems.

If the link doesn‚Äôt work, the product is called Paula‚Äôs Choice Acne Body Spray. It‚Äôs nice because it‚Äôs so much easier to use than a wash, it‚Äôs the right strength of salicylic acid to get rid of acne, AND unlike a wash it‚Äôs LEAVE-ON, so it will really do its job instead of Washing it off.

Edit: since some are confused about what introversion is. Some people say socializing drains them. I guess the definition is loose. But for me, socializing doesn‚Äôt drain me. But I just do not feel the need to socialize very much. When I think of doing anything, I rarely think of doing it with someone (ex. Going to a museum, going for a walk, grabbing a bite). If I have to socialize i will. But if I don‚Äôt have to, I may not. This doesn‚Äôt translate to rudeness tho, I definitely treat guests in our house with attention even if they‚Äôre not mine for example. I know when it‚Äôs expected to socialize and i will, so not only because i HAVE have to. It takes me a long time to feel lonely, because im happy with being alone for long period of time. One more thing is that i do not share personal details about myself with people who are ‚Äúclose‚Äù to me. Im rarely the friend who ‚Äúneeds to open up‚Äù‚Ä¶ im always the one listening tho.

Dependancy has increased substantially over the past decades, because of how society has unfolded. Your husband will only make things way harder for your son. If your son stays, he can save A LOT for himself and his late 20s may not be so bad. Its far more COMPETITIVE out here in 2020 too as compared to 1998. Tell your husband that 17 year old him could probably get a job without a list of extracurriculars but 17 year old son here has way more job requirements!!

I wish I could help you more but since I don‚Äôt have this problem (i was very timid growing up) i cant guarantee what things will help actually solve this issue, but it has been shown that things like meditation and mindfulness do help with gaining control over oneself. I wish I could meditate but I‚Äôm just so exhausted all the time.
