AskTeens,ev8wrh4,t3_ciamu4,1564294742.0,"Join a club or a team my biggest regret of high school. you'll always have a community, shop classes are good too, even if you don't like shop classes the people are normally the most laid back  and very non judgmental space, decide what your into  and go along with that, during your teenage years its best to conform a little bit but always be an individual  because thats what makes people know you from just another kid. The most ""popular"" kids are always low key weird. but they own it so everyone  else accepts it.  i just graduated and they aren't lying when they say the word popular means nothing after high school. The most popular  girls in my high school like right out of a  fucking movie friend group  were crying admitting high school was their peak."
AskTeens,ev8w9vh,t3_cidabp,1564294141.0,"best parties if you can open up!!   i was always semi popular but never partied, so when i did go i was super awkward but the ones where i said fuck it got wasted and talked to everyone were a blast, if i sat there awkwardly i felt out of place and awkward. but in reality no one cares your there, and the only reason anyone will notice you is if your sitting there awkwardly or you that one drunk person.

  1. ALWAYS HAVE A DRINK IN YOUR HAND 

2. IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO STAND BY THE PONG TABLE 

3. EASIEST PEOPLE TO TALK TO ARE THE ONES FOLLOWING GF OR BF AROUND"
