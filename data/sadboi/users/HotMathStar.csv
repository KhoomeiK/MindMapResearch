I hit something in the road and my car started giving the tell-tale thumping sound of a flat tire.  Thankfully there was an exit that I could immediately take and slowly cruise into a gas station parking lot.  Being sort-of young and exhausted from a long weekend of visiting high school friends and the drama that entails, I pulled out my cell phone to call my dad but instead just started sobbing in my car.

A kind lady gently knocked on my car window.  She had apparently been behind my car at the exit and noticed it gushing air.  She comforted me and committed to finding help.  I told her that my dad had taught me to change the tire, but she just said ""You sit tight and relax!""  She proceeded to recruit two gentlemen at the gas station to help her in changing my tired while I just sat there in my misery.  The three of them worked together, in the still-pouring rain, to switch out the tire.  In the end she gave me her road-side assistance kit, which I imagine must be really pricey -- it had every tool you can imagine for fixing common vehicle issues. I tried to refuse, but she just said, ""My husband gave this to me, and right now I want you to have it.   
 I can get another one easily.  You just get safely back to wherever you are going.""

I thanked her profusely and I hope she and the gentlemen who helped me that day know that they did a \*huge thing\* for a scared, young college freshman."

I have done this before and it works, but it is not quite as good as putting a tiny bit more effort into it, primarily because different veggies cook at different rates so some may end up soggy/obliterated.

Ahem, the better method:

* Chop all veggies that you plan to use. Onion, garlic, carrots, and celery is a solid base for most soups, but beyond that go crazy with what you have on hand!
* Heat oil in a soup/stock pot
* Saute the onion first for a few minutes (4 or 5) until translucent
* Add garlic and cook, stirring pretty constantly for about a minute
* Add celery and carrots and cook for a few minutes more (another 5).  If you are using potatoes, throw those in at this point to pre-cook too.
* Add the rest of your veggies and enough water/stock to just cover the top of the veggies.  If you are using lentils throw those in now, too, and add a tiny bit more liquid than to just cover.
* Bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer and cover.  Stir occasionally. Simmer a total of 15-20 minutes, or until the densest veggies seem fork-tender.
* If you are using delicate greens (like spinach or chard), throw those in within the last 3 minutes. (Cabbage is hearty so it goes in earlier)
* If using pre-cooked beans, throw those in within the last 3 minutes too.

(1) Remind yourself that you are likely \*the expert\* (or among a very small few experts) in the room on what you are talking about.  

(2) Nervousness is always the worst in the first minute or two, and then you sort of get into the research that you're passionate about and it fades away.  So, I remember that the worst will be over after a minute (usually even just 30 seconds), take a deep breath, and make sure I pace myself for the first few sentences...when I get nervous I tend to talk too fast, and that makes me sound more nervous, which is a negative feedback loop for overcoming the initial period of nerves.

(3) Think of the presentation as not just a time for you to share your work, but to also receive insight and feedback that can move your research forward and improve it in a way that you wouldn't experience if you are only ever talking to people in the same lab!

Since each element in S is in exactly 10 A\_i's, then if we add up the (not all distinct) elements in A\_i's then each element in S will have been counted 10 times.

The next equality just replaces the sum of n(A\_i), which is the number of (again, not all distinct) total elements in A\_i's, with 5x30, since we are told that each of the 30 sets has 5 elements.

For P2 and P3, your right-hand side of the DE is the same form as one of the solutions to the homogeneous problem, which means that using a particular solution of the same type will just differentiate to zero (which you saw in your work).  To get around this, we find a linearly independent solution by multiplying by the lowest power of the independent variable that will give us a unique solution type.

Identify some personal optimal\* values for Run Time, Distance, and Pace.  Use these in the formula to essentially capture how close you are to some sort of ""goal.""  This might mean that your formula changes after you've been training for a while, but that seems to me like a reasonable thing to do anyway.

(\* Optimal will mean slowest pace for this formula to work nicely, even though a slow pace isn't considered ideal).

So, for example, if you are pretty sure that the furthest you are going to run in a single session (based on your current goals) is 5 miles, and that you think that the longest you would ever choose to run in a single session is one hour, and then that the slowest\* pace you will have is 10 min/mile. 

Score = (Run Time/ Max Run Time) + (Distance / Max Distance) + \[(Slowest Pace - Pace) / Slowest Pace\]

Notice that each term is similar to a percentage of the optimal\* values, so that as you get closer to these values (or further in the case of slowest pace), the terms contribute more to the score.  Multiply by either 10 or 100 if you want to see whole numbers.

DecidingToBeBetter,eq0kp78,t3_bw9pmf,1559687094.0,"Great post!  However, I disagree slightly with something you wrote in #4:

""Ignore what the haters have to say.""

If they are truly ""haters,"" then sure.  When we receive negative or critical feedback, it can be easy to dismiss it as being from a ""hater"" and thus not worth considering.  But oftentimes the feedback that is hardest to hear or act upon can ultimately lead us to greater success or achievement. We simply need to be open to reflect upon it!"
MathHelp,epzonjx,t3_bwr2sf,1559669710.0,"Both of the solutions come from rationalizing the denominator (i.e., moving the radical out of the denominator by multiplying by a convenient form of 1).  For example:

4/( 2\\sqrt{5} ) \* ( \\sqrt{5} / \\sqrt{5} ) = ( 4 \\sqrt{5} / 2\*5 ) = (2 \\sqrt{5} / 5).

As far as why one would bother...it's sort of pedantic, in my opinion.  Rationalizing the denominator is the ""proper"" way to simplify the answer, but what you arrived at is equivalent.  So for almost all purposes your solution will suffice."

MathHelp,epcx8n4,t3_buizkg,1559159490.0,"Since your original limit takes on a form of ""constant / zero,"" you can immediately deduce that the limit goes to infinity without doing further computation (like factoring).  

To see why, recall that while the numerator is gradually approaching 5, the denominator is approaching zero.  As the denominator gets closer to zero, you are dividing a number close to 5 by a number that is getting smaller and smaller.  5/1 = 5, 5/0.1 = 50, 5/0.01 = 500, and so on.  The smaller the denominator gets, the larger the overall result...and there is no upper bound to this."
