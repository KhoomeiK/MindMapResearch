The man who picked me up was protecting me from being crushed. I couldn't take my eyes off him. I'd never seen anyone so attractive in my life. Sweaty and dusty and saving my life. We had only spoken a few words between songs. We were pressed against eachother and lost in the music. I stayed with him until the end of the show. As the last song ended he kissed me. It was probably the most epic moment of my life. When I came back to reality and remembered my friends were probably worried he picked me up and carried me through the crowed as if I was hurt. People make a path pretty quicky that way...  we wrote our numbers down on some scrap flyers we found laying around. 
As we parted I said ""today was amazing... I waited all month for this""
He replied with ""I've waited my whole life for this"".

Our entire relationship was pretty perfect. Had to be kept in secret because of my family's religious beliefs. Which only made the story more romeo and juliet. I was always sneaking off to find him. So many adventures. 

I'd love to say it was happily ever after but we were ripped apart with no fault of our own.

But I can honestly stay that I saw him and fell immediately.  And wherever he is... I still have love in my heart for him. Life just had other plans. 
I still have the flyer he wrote his number on 15 years later."

1. Don't drink the water. Use bottled water only. Call the front desk and request more water bottles. There is never enough.
2. Stay together. Always. 
3. Don't swim in the ocean at dusk/night
4. There will be random men (esp. At the airport) who slip you their cards with a name and number saying ""if you need anything"". Do not use these. Super dangerous and illegal.
5. Bring tip money. The place is all inclusive but tips will get you faster service, stronger drinks. Esp. if you go to to the same bartender repeatedly. 
6. Towel cards are a thing. Make sure you get them upon check in. You will not get your beach towel with out one. Also if you find abandoned beach towels..scoop em up and trade them in for fresh ones. You only get one per person and if you lose it or fail to turn it in at the end of your stay, you're charged. 
7. If the cleaning staff fails to change your sheets. Pull them off the bed and leave them on the floor.
8. SUNSCREEN! All the time. I never burn but a 10 minute walk with out it and I was pink.
9. Bring your own soap/shampoo/conditioner 
10. Drink mama Juana. But be careful, its potent!"
