mentalhealth,f8yv0ro,t1_f8wavs3,1574953229.0,I'm susposed to be going to a psychologist for my depression but I never mentioned this issue to my doctor because I don't know what's wrong with me and what if they don't understand or it's not a thing. I've done counselling and therapy in the past and even they wouldn't do much or understand anything.
