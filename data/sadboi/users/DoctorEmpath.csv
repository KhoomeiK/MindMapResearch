It looks like you are still in the early stages, so that's good. Just don't let it cross the threshold and become ""necessary"" for you otherwise you will later on have a problem in paying attention when doing self-study, tbh it's not so difficult to pay attention in class in comparison to self study. And if this gets out of hands, then you will start wasting a lot of your waking hours on this which will take a toll on your academic, social and personal life."

MaladaptiveDreaming,fnw7yol,t1_fnw5ukb,1587313236.0,"> Don't we have a strong personality?

I wouldn't exactly say that we have a strong personality, we have a more of a flexible/malleable personality. We can adapt to the environment. We can cushion the sufferings of people depending upon the kind of assistance they need at the moment and step up in the face of a situation IF, and that's a big if, one gets rid of the self-loathing or self-pity, if there is any. I don't have it but I have seen many members suffering from it. They like to label themselves as victims hoping that others will come to their rescue.

> Do you give different reaction to something depending on your personality that day?

Not really, as I mentioned in a previous comment of mine. I overdosed on the James Bond franchise and that is what I stay in most of the time and it is much stronger and denser in the offline world. In the online world, I am just trying to help people, like Bay Max from Big Hero 6!"

But what really helped me was getting Red Pilled and also going again and again through cycles of failures due to MDD. Now, I know what will happen in the future if I participate in daydreaming at a specific time, like, I know what it's going to take away from me. 

So, I can ""probably"" stop it at will but then again I don't have anything better to do in my spare time, so I wouldn't stop it right now.

Red Pilling is the short route. Like understanding the world, finding a purpose and then realising what will happen if you keep wasting your time in MDD. 

Most people hate Red Pill so I might get down voted for this but I stand out from the crowd for something I believe in.

All the best!! DM me anytime for help or if you need someone to talk to."
