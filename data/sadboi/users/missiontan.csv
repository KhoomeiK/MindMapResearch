I'm sure she was shocked to hear her son say he didn't want her to visit or say hello to her on Mother's Day or allow her to see her granddaughter. It's not because he doesn't have the capacity to it's only because his wife doesn't want to be bothered with her."
AmItheAsshole,fq806pu,t1_fq66ad1,1589155817.0,"Her family literally wouldn't exist if it wasn't for her mother-in-law though. After all, the mother-in-law gave birth to son or chose to mother (if he's adopted). I think a lot of these women in this new generation seem very entitled and selfish. I could see if her MIL was a bad woman, but she's simply excited to be a grandmother. If she was a less involved grandmother... then would the op be complaining about that?"
AmItheAsshole,fq7w6a6,t1_fq6rpi0,1589153452.0,"YES, we did see both grandmothers on Mother's Day and I'm an ""actively parenting mother"" LOL to a 2 year old and a 4 year old. It seems particularly cruel and unusual punishment for simply being an overzealous grandmother. I could see if she were evil, but being annoying isn't reason enough to  withhold access to grandchildren. We did a simple drive by today and they said hi to their grandmothers with the windows closed."
AmItheAsshole,fq7uvuh,t1_fq6ozuy,1589152696.0,"I disagree... it's a day to pay homage to mothers regardless of whatever type of mother they are. Frankly, when you become a mother you are always actively a mother for the rest of your life."
AmItheAsshole,fq7u0ki,t3_ggyqwz,1589152185.0,"I honestly think it's harsh. I get you want to spend time with your baby and not be annoyed with MIL, but it seems cruel to do it on Mother's Day. You could carve out a small amount of time to do a drive by or something, but to flat out tell your mil that you don't want her to see her grandchild on Mother's Day seems particularly mean.

I have a mother in law who is evil, but seeing all of these women treat their mother-in-law's awful for simply being overzealous grandmothers is weird and quite honestly it seems overly mean in my opinion."

I agree with that to a certain respect. I think this is a bad season to address it though because in previous seasons it's been a little more obvious. I actually think Ariana has been more forthcoming this season more than any other and she actually seems more enjoyable this season too.

Tom always says they never fight, but we've seen them fight before in the past and quickly resolve it and refuse to address it again. I think they fight, but they're good about keeping things off camera. I think it bothers everyone that they can maintain that sort of self-control. 

I also find it annoying that Tom lies about it though... every couple has issues and he makes it sound like none exist. I think he's not being fully honest. No one has a perfect relationship and if they claim to, they're either not being honest with themselves or they're in a deeply troubled relationship."
