Abortion is illegal here, and for any type of sterilization you'd have to ask for your spouse's approval and have at least 1 child. Legally. OP's point is really Western, and poverty is a legitimate reason in third world countries like ours.

Have a good day!"
childfree,fmsfmgo,t3_fwvfxi,1586354456.0,"I'd like to offer a bit of an opposition? I guess.

Perhaps we shouldn't always quite blame breeders (especially poor ones), for, well, breeding.  My sister and I had a conversation awhile ago about how annoyed I am that mothers on twitter are basically begging for diapers and medicine donations for their children- I was suddenly tagged as a bit classist. While a part of me believes that those in poverty shouldn't be having kids, I might as well consider the other factors such as:

1. Lack of government funding for reproductive health which results to poor families having little to no access to birth control, and the general lack of funding for sex ed in general
2. The view of children as possible workers for parents (well, this is selfish as fuck but I'll consider), as poor parents need extra income from their kids when they can work
3. The unfortunate reality of families that can get by on a normal month by month basis, but are suddenly reduced to poverty because of emergencies (such as COVID-19, where normal wage workers are suddenly scraping their savings just to get by)

Maybe OP's opinion could be limited to a small group of people, but not all. Maybe it'd be better to limit this view to mindless breeders who knowingly go into poverty and drag their children along with them, not those who are poor without the resources to plan or space their children accordingly. Some people can support their kids on average, but suddenly lose all their funds and be on the brink of poverty within months. *We'd never really know.* I would say that **family planning should be a major responsibility of the government,** and the outliers would be the poor breeders who decide to bear semen demons for the joy of it.

Well, at least it's that way in my country. It's a third world, peasant-dominated economy, and OP and a lot of other people's views are puritan and very Western. I still am definitely childfree (fuck babies, thanks), but I wouldn't limit the conversation to poor people being stupid. It may just be an issue of the lack of resources, sudden economic downturns, and shitty government plans in general."

SafeSexPH,fk6uuo9,t1_fk6r9y2,1583917171.0,Plus it doesn't break the bank! Our helper at home used those pills before for 2 years and not one scare daw so I followed suit! Lol. Idk why American pill brands cost upwards of 2k per month pero you can get them here for 50!
SafeSexPH,fk6qpcq,t3_feysif,1583911959.0,Copper IUD is effective by 99.9% when you have it put in within 5 days of sex! Then 99.2% effective as birth control for the next 12 years. Just sharing another option :)
SafeSexPH,fk6qmex,t3_fgazu4,1583911853.0,"I took Lady pills for a total of 3 months! They're by the same brand as Trust. 

Pros: 
-No spotting at all when I took it (as compared to trust, where I'd spot everyday). 
-BF came inside me! So pretty good as birth control (and that was near the date of my ovulation- I understand that you don't ovulate on birth control but I kept tabs just in case)
-I bleed right on time, that is, 5 days after the 5th placebo pill
-No changes in skin or hair; maybe they just dried a bit. The formulation in lady and trust pills isnt designed for acne like Althea (yung Althea, testosterone inhibitor, kaya good for acne).
-Totally effective!!! Well for the 3 months I took them :) 

Cons:
-Shitty depression. Seriously. Whenever I stopped taking these pills (like when I went off of them), I would have days with suicidal thoughts. Yikes. Pero I never had mood changes when I was on it, only when I went off it, and only for a few days lang naman. 
-I had to take it everyday. This one isn't so bad because I'm obsessive with not missing a dose, but I switched to the copper IUD so I don't have to think about it anymore.
-Hard to hide from parents LOL! 
-Lady pill formulation is the same as Microgynon 30. In the UK, most forum posts I read had women get pregnant on that formulation. Sooo that totally scared me. Lol"

birthcontrol,fjwbtpd,t1_fjuan8g,1583637488.0,What harsh reactions are we talking about here?
birthcontrol,fjq5vex,t3_feqqq4,1583568181.0,"There's no info on it but if you're that worried go to Watson's. It seems also by your post history that you've already experienced pregnancy scares before, so its also nice to get on some form of reliable birth control"
sex,fj5qrm8,t1_fhj74nk,1583040030.0,"If you're posting on r/statistics I think you'd get critiqued for confirmation bias. All you wanted was a single poster (of all the dozens that commented on here that it /doesn't/ work as effectively) to confirm what you already believe about the pull out method. 

I'd suggest for your gf to go on the implant instead as it has a 0.05% failure rate or basically 1 in 10,000. Pulling out is playing with fire if you definitely DON'T want kids"
bipolar,fj52u5w,t3_fapjg3,1583022872.0,"I was diagnosed with BP2 just over a few months ago. Went on mood stabilizers and I gained some weight andd hated it at first. Soon enough my moods started going good- I don't know why I decided to drop meds last month, maybe in the hopes of triggering a hypo state. It didn't work, got depressed and wanted to kill myself. But this Feb I started again and it's looking up. It ain't too late to start taking your meds again! I'm doing much better now so I hope this keeps up."
birthcontrol,fj1x9z2,t1_fj0bf5b,1582929869.0,Wish I were your friend with the cramp-free experience :( how many mg ibuprofen do you take? My cramps are getting worse and worse!
SafeSexPH,fhyw664,t1_fhyfymj,1581985149.0,"Not dumb at all! IUDs are generally given out to ajust about anyone (that's from the WHO Family Planning Guide), unless there's reason to believe that you shouldn't get it (high risk for STIs, unmitigated HIV+ status, etc.) A caveat though, since you're a virgin you might experience some pain from the Speculum and the cervix action, a bit more than a regular sexually active woman would. They will measure your uterus anyway to find out if you're a good candidate for insertion. There are articles online about virgins who got IUDs as a form of protection and I suggest you look into it. Good luck!"
SafeSexPH,fhxfm4d,t1_fhxbu28,1581953235.0,"....they didn't say they were gonna answer the question, though üòÖ


Well since it's next week and you did it yesterday then baka hindi ka naman mabubuntis. But stop leaving it to chance... no pregnancy test will detect at 7 days, unless it's one of the fancy US brands na 6 days before your period malalaman mo na. Still, you can test 2 then 3 weeks from now if you haven't gotten your period... safe sex please. Alam mo na ngang magwoworry kayo, wala pa kayong ginawa in advance."
birthcontrol,fhx439u,t1_fhu5vgu,1581943866.0,:( That's unfortunate! How did you know it had fallen into your cervix?
SafeSexPH,fh6sjv1,t1_fh6phgp,1581305060.0,"The copper IUD is safe for breastfeeding moms! I did spot when it was first inserted (syempre it irritated my cervix), but no more irregular spotting after. Its safe for anyone basically- except women with copper toxicity issues (in the genes yan). I saw in your post history na kinakabahan ka- it is effective as emergency contraception for up to a week after sex (accdg to the nurse) at 99.9%- then the rest of the time, 99.2%.

If you do consider, it'll be much much easier for you because your cervix is already partly more open since you already gave birth. It won't hurt as much:) good luck."
SafeSexPH,fh6nb55,t1_fh5zpfj,1581301868.0,"Hi! I'm on my third period now. So far, no issues. :) However, my first period lasted almost 2 weeks and my second one lasted 6-9 days. This one seems to be ending at 5 days. Cramps seem to be the warning sign of my period, so they appear suddenly and can cause me to wince in pain- it's like a deep sensation of getting pinched from the inside. Just yesterday my cramps were so intense that I felt like vomitting.

My periods are spotting-light-heavy-medium-light, and there is a LOT of blood during the heaviest days. Murder scene looking energy!! Lol. I've been taking iron and folic acid tablets to help and I can't be sure to make a correlation yet. Spacing of my period was 33 days and now back to 28 days- hope it stays the same, but di mo talaga matatancha period mo for the first few months. Good luck!!"
SafeSexPH,fh27p2m,t3_f12dyc,1581239158.0,"How irregular? Shorter or longer? Pag shorter, it's better to wait 7 days. If longer, first day of the period is okay, since you're not likely to be ovulating early"
SafeSexPH,fh1qpjg,t3_f12dyc,1581221431.0,"as long as you keep taking your pill at the same time, you're good to go! Your period is 1-2 weeks away from ovulation (assuming you're regular), and by then, the pills will have already worked long enough for your body not to ovulate/thicken cervical mucus"
SafeSexPH,fgxcqgv,t3_f0qza9,1581171373.0,"I doubt it. And if you were part of that 0.0001% chance, name your baby Jesus! Just wait for your period"
