TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fmycpm8,t3_fxpq0c,1586483121.0,"If there's ever been an appointment time to feel anxious and emotional it's now. 
I cried to my boss for an hour a few weeks ago. Sometimes you just need to cry. People may not always understand but they're usually willing to accept things if you come to them with a need for compassion. 

If there are specific things you know are causing work related stress maybe you can create a list to review with your boss. Make a plan or create phases so you're not focused on EVERYTHING that needs doing. 

I've also found that during this time of working from home having hard boundaries of set work hours and breaks with moving around is helpful. 

And laughing. I know it sounds stupid but I watch TikTok for an hour and laugh out loud like an idiot and just making my face muscles smile helps a bit. 
I hope some of this helps because you are not alone in this."

I'm general, BC can cause different side effects like longer heavier periods, lighter shorter periods, make periods stop all together. You need to take the pill for 7 days before it is effective."

This is the mat I practice on to do hot yoga and I don't have to use a yoga sweat towel it grips so we'll. It's about 5 pounds and stay in place. The grip is much better than the manduka Pro series in my opinion. 

You can find it on Amazon for under $80. During manduka sales the more unusual colors get discounted to nearly $50.

If you're looking to connect maybe ask about something they're really into. Favorite book, movie, album. Something you can experience for yourself and then talk with them about.

A relationship should be the cherry on top of everything else in your life. It's shouldn't be the bedrock you build everything else on. I think our society encourages us to think that we are not whole until we have: a partner... Or maybe a kid...and then maybe another kid. Or whatever specific attachment society tells us we should have. Same thing with owning a house or college degree. Whatever. 


It's a fucked up methodology to think a boy/girlfriend is going to make everything in our lives better. We should work towards being a stronger individual regardless of relationship status. Knowing ourselves and what works for us.


People need to be challenged in order to grow. YOU will grow from the shit your ex put you through. You will grow from going to meetings. You will grow because you will randomly realize that that one thing you learned from a meeting is a solution to a problem that isn't even dealing with addiction. Your ex and your friend will make the same stupid mistakes over and over and put others through the same shitty situations they put you through. They will either refuse to see the obvious or they will learn from it. That's their problem. 


There's is peace of mind in knowing YOU will find joy in your relationships because you now know what does and does not work for you. You won't make the same mistake and emotionally harm others in the ways your ex has and probably will continue to do."

infj,er43v4j,t3_c0dk0s,1560480394.0,"Step into what you enjoy. If it makes you feel crappy then redirect your focus to something you really love and that action will attract friends and people interested in what you're doing in a more genuine way. Hobbies are where it's at. 
It is good to put yourself into slightly uncomfortable but safe situations to practice being around people and manage situations but it's not a requirement especially if it isn't making you happy.

It might be time to evaluate your friendships if you're always feeling drained after being with these people... Maybe make plans with smaller groups or go out to lunch with just one person. If you're looking to move past the acquaintance phase and also feel better contributing to a friendship as a listener then ask people about their hobbies. ""I'm really interested in learning more about this thing you do, can I pick your brain about it next week?"" Maybe it feels awkward. Maybe it IS awkward. Create the opportunity for yourself and see what comes from it. Also, a shared comfortable silence is highly underrated.

I often feel like I want human interaction - not necessarily social interaction. Go out to places that attract you. I go to museums, art shows, local breweries, free community events, live music, volunteer, libraries, coffee shops. I go alone. I interact with people when I want to. I usually ask a friend or two but I've become much more comfortable and confident existing and going about things at my own pace by just chosing to explore things on my own. I hope this helps ðŸ˜Š"

The way I've head it explained: alcoholism is categorized as a disease so rehab may be covered by health insurance. This is to help the individual. Sure a lot of other people may benefit from the person's recovery but it's only there to help the addict.


If the person in question is suffering from other issues caused by drinking like liver failure or mental illness then medical care may be covered by their insurance plan. Not necessarily because ""alcoholism"" but because ""liver failure""."
