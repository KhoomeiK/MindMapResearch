BPD,foxiwpz,t3_g9smkr,1588145414.0,"Your emotions are always valid.



""Upset"" doesn't mean ""to hurt"". We can feel emotions and expressing them well.




""Emotional"" doesn't mean to give your center up. Try to be centered the most of the time. Try to shut the others' mouth by with your calm. 




Here you have a community. We are never alone but it seems that. Some people feel alone in a ""good family"" or in a party.




Be the loving self for your other selfs frequently."
