BPD,fqaz8bk,t1_fqacpkn,1589227828.0,"Iâ€™ve touched a bit on boundaries, patience, and support  but I will include a mention of empathy because I think itâ€™s seriously lacking from many. I also want to touch on how people really only think in the context of them and never think about how our disorder affects US first and foremost. Thank you!!!"
BPD,fqayyr2,t1_fqawwal,1589227697.0,I planned to cover PTSD but havenâ€™t done so yet so I will be sure to include this and look up more. Thank you so much!!
BPD,fqayuor,t1_fq91rip,1589227641.0,yes! iâ€™ve definitely talked about this and stated that while it is chronic it does definitely get better. I also plan on wrapping up the end of the thread with more of that sentiment. Thank you!
BPD,fnnx6cs,t1_fnm7qs4,1587104521.0,Thank you so much!! And Iâ€™m honored to motivate your first comment! :)
BPD,fnm78pu,t1_fnl0wfw,1587066311.0,"Ah while I canâ€™t fully relate, I do understand the feelings that come with a new diagnosis (last month was 1 year since iâ€™ve been diagnosed) and how that makes you rethink absolutely everything about your life. Itâ€™s amazing that youâ€™re in therapy to work it out and totally understandable that this new information and understanding of yourself has you questioning if you made the right choice for you. I hope youâ€™re able to find the info you need. Learning to trust yourself is one of the biggest issues with BPD, so make sure that with whatever actions you take, you do what makes you truly happy! Sending lots of support your way!"
BPD,fnk75ld,t1_fnk659i,1587017010.0,Thank you. It definitely comes and goes depending on how bad my loneliness gets but Iâ€™m pushing through
BPD,fnk74do,t1_fnk6t4u,1587016979.0,Yes yes this is exactly what I mean. Like letâ€™s just jump in this thing but set up some windfalls and boundaries so we can manage it as we go. I feel like Iâ€™ve worked on myself enough to at least recognize bad patterns and mostly avoid them that I could but I feel like there arenâ€™t many people open to it
aromantic,fh8jht1,t1_fh77ceu,1581361051.0,open to interpretation ðŸ˜‚
aromantic,fh5vevn,t1_fh5pi7i,1581292649.0,I hadnâ€™t even noticed. Love when that happens ðŸ˜‚
BPDmemes,fg5jtdh,t3_ewwbve,1580529413.0,ppl always think iâ€™m a slytherin Iâ€™m a hufflepuff but honestly theyâ€™re two sides of the same coin if you really think about it.
BPD,ff85uql,t3_es4b8r,1579666832.0,I like to imagine a roundtable of multiple mes when I talk to myself cause then itâ€™s like a discussion :)
