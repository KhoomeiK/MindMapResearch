Christian,fpfju3d,t3_gd2req,1588573455.0,"Hey. I just wanna tell you that i felt the way you feel, a while back. Almost four years ago, to be exact. I grew up believing my parents's beliefs regarding God and let's just say it didn't lead me far. It fizzled out pretty quickly when i learned of an outside world, filled with so many tempting things. God let me wander for all these years but He eventually brought me back to Him. I lived through some stuff and i came out broken as a result. I was a shadow of the empty shell i had become straying from God. At my lowest point, i remembered my parents's teachings and i cried out to God. I didnt know what i wanted. I didnt know what i believed. But in that moment, i knew i had nothing or no one to turn to. And God listened. He has been with me ever since. He speaks to me every day. But let me tell you that it did not come without its fair share of sacrifices. I had to sacrifice so many things that were keeping me far from Him. But in the end, it was so worth it.

My advice to you is this. Pray to God with sincerity. Ask Him to show you what you must change or get rid of in your life. If something comes to mind, cast it away. God listens to those who call to Him, and He speaks to those who listen. 

Ill keep you in my prayers, brother."
Christian,fpfj267,t3_gbe0i7,1588572765.0,"I hate condemning people. I hate calling certain actions ""wrong"". Yes, homosexuality as well as pre-marital sex are considered sins by God, and they are, but not because they are evil action. I like to view God's rules as guidelines to live a healthy life through Him. Most of said rules will make sense when you think about it, like why you shouldnt steal, lie or even commit murder. The rules set regarding sexuality are, however, a little more ambiguous. Unbridled lust is a powerful tool at the hands of the enemy. Lust can corrupt you in ways unseen, reach far down your soul.  Even just fantasizing about another's partner leads your mind down paths where you don't belong as a christian. 

Homosexuality and premarital sex are considered as sins because God created sex to be something held up high, regarded as sacred. Something a man and a woman who love Him could share. It is the highest form of intimacy and even creates spiritual ties, as it is written that those who sleep together ""become one flesh"". It unites two lovers in a highly spiritual way. And God wants us to reserve that for after we solemnly commit to our lover before mankind as well as God Himself. 

One thing i'd like to add is that homosexuality is NOT the worst sin. There is NO worst sin. ALL sin is equally deserving of death before God. We are all, by our very nature and from the begining of our existence in the womb, damned by the sin of the first humans Adam and Eve. But by Jesus's life, death and resurection, we are saved. But only if we believe in Him and give up everything to follow Him."

I finally understand the magnitude of what Jesus has done for us, His love so incomprehensible that He chose to be betrayed, to suffer like no other, die in agony and then go to hell for three days for us. I know He chose to do so because Jesus said Himself that He has legions of angels waiting to follow His every commande yet He still died, and because He stayed in hell for three days but then He killed death itself and came back to life. He could have done it at any moment, He could even NOT have gone to hell. But He chose to take all of the punishment we deserve, every single bit of it and suffer through it so we didn’t have to. 
God has truly opened my eyes and He speaks to me every day through His scripture. That’s not a metaphor or a pretty way to say it. God speaks to me directly. He is alive and true.

This is the power and the love of our God. That is why I believe that whoever trusts in Him is placing themselves behind the protection of a loving king, who has power over the world. He will be your shield as well as your sword, as He is mine. That is our God, brother."

He sacrificed His own life for us sinners, so that not only our sinful nature but our past sins, whatever they may be, may be forgiven and forgotten through Him. I have never done any of the things you mentioned, aside from watching porn. And yet, I am still as worthy of death and of being cast away from God’s presence as you are. But God so loved the world that I gave His only son to be used as the ultimate sacrifice so that ANYONE who would believe in Him and what He did for us humans may be saved and have eternal life in His presence. I suggest you start reading your bible again. Specifically the new testament, starting at the beginning. 

Jesus has already paid the price for your sins. Saying that your soul is unsalvageable is calling Jesus’s death useless. 
God does indeed speak to those who listen. He has been talking to me for the past month, after I turned around and gave my life to Him. 

But remember that following the path that God set out for us has its price. You will be called to abandon your life of sins, to give up your way of living all for the glory of our God. It might not be easy at first but remember this: the bible says that with Jesus on the cross, so too have we died and resurrected, but our sinful selfs have stayed behind in the grave. Through Jesus’s death, the ties that sin had on us have been severed. We are free, brother. 

I will pray for you. Please stay strong and trust in God, our maker. He made the earth, the sky, the planets, the stars and He made you. He knows you by name. Trust that He is powerful enough to save you. Glory be to His Holy Name."

nihilism,fp174mv,t1_fp14rta,1588226295.0,"So glad you asked. Hers is my life story, stranger.

I grew up in a religious household. Nothing crazy, my parents believed in God but weren't sawing heads off about it. They taught me about God and the bible and i read it through and through a number of times. When i was 20 years old i met this non-christian girl and we started going out. At that point I had just come out of a 2 year long relationship with an ultra-radical christian girl and it really fucked me up. It lead me to despise anything related to religion and the like. As i went out with my second girlfriend, i grew further and further from my parents' teaching. I was happy. But i had this pit in my stomach, this empiness that nothing could fill. It got worse with time and 3 years later i had gone fully nihilistic. I still believed in God in the back of my mind but my entire soul was screaming emptiness. I found only relief in alcohol and weed. And even then it wouldnt stop. I felt like nothing meant anything, like life itself was a sick joke. Then, my girlfriend slept with one of my friends from work. What little was left of me was broken. My dignity and trust were shattered and i felt hopelesness and utter pain crash over my entire existence. I was in agony. I had lost everything. But then I remembered what my parents' had taught me. Their own beliefs. The knowledge they had past onto me. So, with nowhere else to turn, i prayed God. I cried out to him, told him i wasn't sure of anything anymore, that i wasnt sure what i even wanted regarding him, that i was confused and hurt. But never the less, i asked him to come help me because i was broken and didnt know how to go on. I remember the moment exactly: I was lying on a sofa during my lunch break at work (i worked nights, it was 3am) and i couldnt sleep. The very moment i gave up and cried out for God's help, I felt a wave of comfort take over me and i felt a presence with me. The morning after, i decided to start reading the bible again, just for the sake of it. And God spoke to me for the first time. He told me through his word that he knew i was hurt, that he knew how i felt and that he was there for me. And he was. I literally felt his presence. A month passed by and i read my bible more and more. I asked God to show me who he was, to teach me his ways, so he did. He talked to me every day since then through his scripture. Whenever i had a question about something, i would read a part of my bible and God would answer me in crazy accurate detail. God speaks to me to this day. He did so this morning and this afternoon. it would be even longer a comment to explain how, exactly, although im willing to share it with you if you'd like. 

&#x200B;

As for proof that God exists or not, he says himself in the bible that there will be no definitive proof of his existence, if not for the beauty of nature and life as well as the life, death and resurrection of his son, Jesus Christ. 

&#x200B;

And as a quick side-note, heaven and hell arent what you think. Heaven isnt the place where you go when youve been a good person, nor is hell where bad people are sent off to be tortured forever. These two places exist, yes. But heaven is where those who want to live with God will go. They will spend eternity in the presence of the creator there. It's not a place of happiness and fulfillment, other than through God. As opposed to that, hell is where you go when you dont want to be with God. You wont get tortured there. Instead, the bible describes hell as a place filled with weeping and gnashing of teeth. It's a place of regret. Because, as the bible also says, everything was made by, through and for God. We all yearn for him, but some will only realise so when it's too late.

&#x200B;

Christian,foz8ujb,t1_foz4edb,1588186613.0,"Here’s the rest of the passage from hebrews:

“He didn’t enter to offer himself over and over again, like the high priest enters the earthly holy place every year with blood that isn’t his. If that were so, then Jesus would have to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. Instead, he has now appeared once at the end of the ages to get rid of sin by sacrificing himself. People are destined to die once and then face judgment. In the same way, Christ was also offered once to take on himself the sins of many people. He will appear a second time, not to take away sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭9:25-28‬ ‭

Jesus lived once, died once, then was resurrected. We are to live the same thing through him. 

Here’s food for thought as well:

“Therefore, if you were raised with Christ, look for the things that are above where Christ is sitting at God’s right side. Think about the things above and not things on earth.”
‭‭Colossians‬ ‭3:1-2‬ ‭

My bible is in french and I think it says it better: “Your goal is to be in the sky, not on the earth.”

What Paul says through this is that our ultimate goal is to be with Christ in the afterlife. Knowing that, I don’t think we would be sent back in this life, regardless of our allegiance, since there is such an emphasis on the afterlife being the true goal of our lives on earth."

Rule 7 of this sub states that he who posts memes about their own cake day as a form of metabaiting shall be punished. 
Take this as a warning. I suggest you refrain from making use of such nefarious karma farming tactics in the future, lest judgement befalls you as a sword to your neck.

As for your parents.. well, mine still don’t get it. They’ve known about my SH pretty much the entire time (they inevitably noticed) and they never understood. It’s a feeling only a select few are given to feel so outsiders will almost always have a hard time getting it. But my parents have supported me regardless and I would venture to say that I think your parents will as well. 

Stay strong, bro. Come back if you need to talk. ❤️"
