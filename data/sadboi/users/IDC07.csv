It might only be your anxiety as well, before I had HA I never took much notice of my heart, now I feel like somethings always going wrong in that area. 

The best advice I can offer is try sitting in a cold room, like a bathroom, and just focus on the feeling of your breathing. Do 4 second inhale through nose, 6 seconds holding in, 4 second exhale. Keep trying until you feel calm, not just your breathing and/or heart rate.

Devour requires you to get hooks and rewards you for it, noed gives you a 1 hit ability for letting all the gens get popped. It’s appealing to newer and lower skilled players understandably, but people who play killers at higher ranks should be able to win games without it and make use of better and more game changing perks. 

While I agree that yes, you can just do all the totems and such it’s more that there’s no real skill involved in using it and it can totally flip the way a games going based on that one perk. The game should be affected equally by all 4 (or however many perks depending on your killers level) and killers shouldn’t be able to receive all (or most) their kills from one perk."

I feel like I’ve wasted Frenzy’s whilst using those addons that I’ve never used them since. 

Other than that, if the oblivious status effect one was on another addon I’d love that idea, as I use the legion pin quite a lot. I think having them oblivious instead would bring about quite a different play-style and it sounds pretty fun. 

Also I like the idea of giving him more speed with things like Joey’s mixtape, however again with a similar point with the cold dirt, I feel like legion deserves a way to decrease his cool down. Especially seeing as basic attacks decrease the cool down when you’re not in frenzy. 

Lastly, I would’ve liked to see your thoughts on a change for the red mixtape (fuming or furious mixtape or something?) because I feel like it’s not even worth being an iridescent addon especially when you compare it to the iri button.

If he sees a person with a key he mildly tunnels them but he never camps, and he usually downs the original person and chases the unhooker or tanks the ds and goes for another chase. Although I’ve seen him leave the unhooked person altogether and go for the unhooker. It’s a legit way to get more hooks without tunnelling."
deadbydaylight,fo30uvr,t1_fo2mcuo,1587478378.0,"I can’t play as one of the girls when I play legion. That scream when you end feral just annoys me, the guys scream is a bit more manageable lol."
deadbydaylight,fo30jdp,t3_g5crjq,1587478193.0,"The dlc’s with Yui, Feng (if your pc, she’s free on console) and Jeff are pretty good, Jeff has some perks which aren’t inherently sneaky, but his distortion perk lets you hide you aura from the killer 3 times. Those characters and their counterpart killers are also pretty balanced and enjoyable."
deadbydaylight,fo2zvlu,t3_g5dl0n,1587477803.0,I’m not gonna reiterate what most people are saying but there’s also a Myers trophy called evil incarnate which requires you to use the Judith’s tombstone or a mori to achieve it. It’s possible he was going for that.
deadbydaylight,fo0i9lf,t1_fnyxl83,1587413626.0,I disagree with your worst killer but I understand why you chose legion.
deadbydaylight,fo0ha0x,t1_fo0gux6,1587413116.0,"Yeah, I always worry that I look toxic but I just do two quick taps if I’m saying thank you, to both killers and survivors"
deadbydaylight,fo0c78b,t1_fo0bgv5,1587410125.0,"I’ll have to find a couple videos on how to do it then, I’ve had many rage-inducing moments where I think I’ve avoided the cone and it just hits me and my plan is foiled lol."
deadbydaylight,fo080kg,t3_g4y37d,1587407683.0,"No rift currently, the tomes are still available from both rifts though which will still award blood points and charms I believe. Also lore."
deadbydaylight,fo07uoy,t3_g4yaxo,1587407601.0,"I won’t lie but when I see someone running urban evasion, no matter if I’m killer or survivor, I assume they’re low rank. It might just be a stereotype I’ve built up but people who tend to hide are usually weaker in chases in my experience. 

I’ve seen good players use urban as well tho, so obviously not everyone fits the bill."
deadbydaylight,fo071hy,t1_fnzpxuv,1587407203.0,I was thinking more how to play around his shock whilst in a chase. I’ve done the locker thing before but during a chase when he shocks you it really throws me off cos I’m unsure of my options at that point cos of the stun effect.
deadbydaylight,fnzpc0o,t1_fnz8nwn,1587398352.0,I’ve had games where I waited longer to queue than I did actually playing.
deadbydaylight,fnzp4f0,t3_g4spwt,1587398245.0,"Myers definitely, jump-scare Myers is my favourite killer to play against ever but Myers in general is a well balanced and fun opponent. The way he creepily comes outta nowhere always gets me."
deadbydaylight,fnzorhj,t1_fnzoh34,1587398060.0,"All of Nancy’s perks are pretty decent, not for everyone but you can mix them with other perks for some fun combos."
deadbydaylight,fnzoixm,t3_g4tc6s,1587397936.0,"I will teabag the killer twice in a row if I’m saying thank you, purely because I don’t know any other way to do it and I’m on ps4, so no post game talk. Other than that I’d say teabagging in any scenario is toxic."
deadbydaylight,fnzo93r,t1_fnznp6i,1587397794.0,How does calm spirit counter him? I thought that only worked on the crows?
