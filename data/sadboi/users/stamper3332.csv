Find someone close you can trust and RELY on (you have to tell someone, this will be almost impossible to do on your own).  Then ask that person to help you with your taper.  Once you figure out what your taper is going to be have that person supply your taper...  get rid of ALL the alcohol in your house, including mouthwash, hand sanitizer... you know the drill.  Then have your trusted friend deliver to you exactly how much alcohol you are allowed per your taper for THAT DAY ONLY.  This way you will not be able to just blow right through a 7 day supply in 1 night.

You can do this.  For real, you can.  Others have done it.

I would recommend getting in touch with your local AA meetings via Zoom (make it local, because those people will be more regular and more connected to you than if you get on some big national meeting).  The folks at AA have gone through this before... in some way, shape or form, each of those alcoholics has sobered up.   They can and will help you (they did for me).

Finally, you are scared and feeling all these horrible feelings in a large part because your brain chemistry is truly broken right now.  More than anything else, you need to remember that you cannot rely on your own thoughts/feelings right now because they are broken.  They are not ‘the adult in the room’.  You need to find others to stand in the breach for you until your mind heals enough to clear a bit.  Right now there is only terror in your mind, but that will change so quickly... 

I will not drink with you today."

ptsd,fr52hwp,t3_glupw9,1589901333.0,"So trauma therapy is an overarching concept, under which there are different techniques such as EMDR, etc.

According to my trauma therapist: 

The main difference between talk therapy and trauma therapy is that in trauma therapy we work from a ‘processing trauma’ perspective more than a ‘telling the story of trauma’, which means we work on staying in the present and integrating the experience.  A therapist with trauma training takes into account that the mind and body of a person with unsealed trauma is functioning in an altered state (e.g. Hyperarousal or hypoarousal).  

A big piece of trauma therapy is helping the nervous system begin to regulate itself properly again: for example, when remembering the trauma, we work on staying in the present (this is not happening to me right now, I am safe) and bringing the CNS into a calmer, more regulated state (using grounding, breathing, etc).  

My therapist employs somatic therapy techniques and gestalt as her basis.  The somatic work really takes into account the mind-body connection.  There are other techniques which include EMDR, CBT, etc which can all be integrated.  

But fundamentally, trauma therapy is about integrating the trauma back into you mind/body, because when it originally occurred it was too much for your mind/body to cope with and therefore, it was not properly integrated.  A way of thinking about this that the trauma is like shrapnel: pieces of the trauma are buried all over your mind and body creating problems.  As the are re-integrated they are put back together in the proper place and context, so they can stop wreaking havoc on the rest of your systems.

Good luck, my friend.  I can tell you personally, there is hope, there is a light at the end of the tunnel."

stopdrinking,fr4qg0s,t1_fr4krgf,1589894761.0,"Heavy drinkers tend to find each other.  Their problem drinking would be shocking to ‘normal drinkers’...

Exactly my point.  Behavior like falling into potted plants or taking a ‘nap’ on your friend’s shoulder in the middle of a party or <insert drunken behavior here> is not actually normal.  It took me some time in sobriety to start realizing that these behaviours are not normal, because all my heavy drinking friends did this kind of stuff too.

Normal drinkers can take alcohol or leave it.  They don’t think that passing out in public (read: taking a nap on a friend’s shoulder) is normal, they don’t think that being tipsy and falling into plants or falling down the steps or peeing in your host’s front flower beds is normal.... they have not normalized these types of excessive drinking behaviours.  

And they are not uncomfortable with another friend’s sobriety, esp to the point of pushing a friend with an admitted problem to keep drinking.

I have spent the entirety of my adult life feeling like I was going crazy, leaving wreckage in my wake, thinking it must be me.

CPTSD,fr1x0bw,t3_gltow0,1589827354.0,"It is dissociation.  

I have a 10 yr period where I have almost zero recollection.  I had my close friend from university come to visit me for 10 days in Paris and even when she told me about it 10 years later along with showing me pictures of the two of us together in front of the Eiffel Tower, etc, I have zero recollection.  

It is part of your trauma. Your anger is your wish that it was not this way.  It is resistance to that which makes you feel abnormal.  But it is there.  It is real.  Perhaps gentleness and compassion toward yourself would be a better response.  Perhaps if you put it in a different context: if you lost your foot in a car accident, you may feel terrible grief and anger that you can no longer run without a prosthetic leg, but you would not blame or hate yourself personally for your inability to run.  It would be obvious that there is damage that is outside of your control.  The same is true with your lack of memories.

To put this a different way: trauma occurs when something happens that is beyond the individual’s ability to cope.  What happens then in the mind uses different ‘emergency measures’ to cope, such as not processing experiences into memory in a way that is generalized beyond the immediate, traumatic incident.  You have been wounded in a serious, though invisible, way.  Anger and self-loathing will not help you recover.

You CAN recover your working memory going forward - although you may never get back all the memories from the past.  Working with a trauma-informed therapist is an important part of the recovery.

CPTSD,fr1vj4s,t1_fr1hv2c,1589826655.0,"One of the techniques that is commonly used in trauma therapy is ‘reparenting’.  In reparenting, when the person engages disturbing thoughts/memories, the person role plays two different people: the child who was harmed (experiencing the feelings, the pain, the fear, the memories, etc) and the parent that the person would be to that child today (telling the child (s)he is safe, holding them, consoling them, explaining to them that what happened was not their fault, that any child would seek validation and I can give you the validation (love, comfort, security) you need now).

This is very powerful, because it brings what the adult person knows to be cognitively true into accessibility to that little child that is still hurt and needy inside of you.  It brings safety, reassurance, peace..."
CPTSD,fr1ur5c,t3_glw10f,1589826290.0,"What you experienced (almost looking forward to the abuse) is a common experience with victims of chronic sexual abuse. 

In a similar vein, but not the exact same, is the common behavior of adult rape victims going out again with their rapist or starting relationships with them.  I was violently raped on a first date and went out on a second date with the man.  I did not understand at the time that victims often do this type of thing to normalize the experience (‘it wasn’t rape if I continue to date him’ type of thinking).  

The reason I share that is because the single hardest detail I have to share when I tell close friends/family about my experience was that I went out on a second date with the man.  It shocks them and they do not understand it.  It muddies the waters for them.  In my case, I needed to hear repeatedly from my trauma therapist that this was a normal reaction, so that I could share it and not feel shame and guilt.

People really struggle with hearing about sexual assault, especially against a child.  It is so heinous and outside of their comprehension, and then layer on top of it that it happened to someone they LOVE....  the feelings are hard to sort out.  

My advice would be to encourage your BF to do his own research into child sexual assault - into the victim experience, into how he can support you.  Trauma, esp prolonged sexual trauma at an early age, comes out in ways that make no sense at all to others (save the trauma informed therapist). I would not throw the baby out with the bath water - if you BF is a good man and is just struggling with his own reactions to your disclosure, then hang on to him and try to work with him to discover new ways for both of you to understand and deal with this horror."

And then I started *trauma informed* therapy.  

Trauma therapy is completely different than talk therapy.  It is addressing the trauma at the level of your body, your central nervous system.  It is helping your CNS learn to regulate itself again.  It is not easy, but you make significant progress quickly.

If it is an option, consider a 45 day treatment before trying to leave your parent’s house and getting a job. 

If that is not an option, then go w the biweekly Friday afternoons. 

Trauma therapy can make enormous changes in a very short period of time. One of the early goals of the work is to help your CNS start to regulate itself again.  Once your CNS is no longer reacting like the trauma is actually happening at that moment, the therapy work becomes easier, softer, less dysregulating. Even so, when big changes occur, you will get rocked pretty hard... but you will have far more tools in our toolbox for coping w the big moments. 

Long story short, if you can make it through the first little while, the trauma exposure stuff, it is going to get more manageable.

I am at 92 days sober and just hit an incredibly rough patch....  I have PTSD from a violent rape and 4 days ago had several flashbacks and all the messy emotional/physical aftermath of those flashbacks.  I TRULY wanted to drink, smoke weed... anything to numb the pain!  And I reached out to literally every person I knew from AA over those 3 days of hell... those people held me up through the entire thing.  I stayed sober!  I could NOT have made it through without the people, most of whom know me only through Zoom, who held the space between me and relapse until I could stand on my own again.  

Thank you A.A.  There are a million reasons to thank you, but today I thank you for helping me get through - for the first time in my life - flashbacks to serious trauma WITHOUT picking up!  Thank you, Higher Power.  Thank you all.

EDIT: Sorry, I did not mean to steal the spotlight.  I got carried away with the joy of being part of this fellowship.  I am so excited for OP bc he KNOWS the power of being part of this fellowship.  Thanks for your post, OP!"
ptsd,fqhg1n3,t3_gihlkp,1589376228.0,"It is hard to explain, and I am not sure I am qualified to explain it. But,  the essence of it is that talk therapy is based in the cognitive (thinking) level of therapeutic intervention - you have to be able to think about it in the conscious level of your mind.  Trauma therapy acknowledges that the event(s) create impacts that are subconscious as well as physical in nature - therefore, the therapy is aimed more at unearthing the trauma and learning how to re-regulate the nervous system.  

Most people I know that have trauma in their backgrounds employ both a trauma therapist and a talk therapist."
ptsd,fqfi92z,t3_gi6f3d,1589325369.0,"Yup.  Totally. 

I have a sexual assault that I remember ZERO details of, but I know it happened bc I can remember all the details of being at the hospital the next day getting a rape kit done on me.  But the actual event is a total blank.

Trauma does that to you in defence of self: if a trauma is too severe for your mind/nervous system to cope with, one way it handles it is to just blank it out.  But it only blanks out the memory, it is still there, along with all the after effects and symptoms of trying to cope with that trauma."
ptsd,fqfhvdy,t3_gihlkp,1589325172.0,"I feel you!  Getting the proper diagnosis feels like all the pieces falling into the right place suddenly.  Things start to make sense in a way they could not before.

If your therapist is not a ‘trauma-informed’ therapist, I highly recommend you find one to augment the talk therapy you do with the first.  Trauma therapy is fundamentally different from other types of therapy.  It is where you will start making progress extremely fast!"
news,fqfgvhi,t1_fqe4r1l,1589324655.0,"As an American living long term in Canada, I can tell you that the incentive to remain an American citizen has gone down substantially.  I have lived in Canada for 15 years, married a Canadian man, been raising children in Canada, but I have always identified strongly as an American.  I have taught my children that they were American as well as Canadian, raised the American flag every 4th of July, etc.  Even as Trump made a complete shit show of the country for 3 years, I have continued to be proud to be an American.

However, I am so appalled by what I see on the news from the states now (and I make a point to read FoxNews.com in addition to my beloved NYTIMES.com), that I am finally saying ‘thank God I live in Canada.’  The country is being torn apart by lack of trust, divisiveness, us-vs-them.... 

And then you put that dipshit Trump at the helm.  His wholesale lack of leadership in this time of crisis is bringing the US to its knees.

The US is no longer a bastion of sanity and moral courage, of leadership and authority EARNED.

It is rapidly becoming not only the laughing stock of the global community, but also a source of danger due to its inept COVID response.

I am personally grateful to be in Canada now.  I have friends and family that I love in the US, but if the US can’t get its head out of its ass and stop destroying itself, then I say: let it burn!"

I do have a trauma therapist, and talked to her today, which helped tremendously.

I think I was just so surprised (taken unaware) by my ongoing  and outsized response to saying just a few sentences.  I did not handle the aftermath as skillfully as I could have, but I am just a ‘baby’ in learning how to deal with my trauma skillfully (and without substances).
