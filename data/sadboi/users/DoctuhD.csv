Our Iceland was discovered by norsemen who had intended to travel to the Faroes in that direction but went past them. That's not really something that would happen with someone in Portugal or Spain though. But supposedly Iceland was also discovered by Irish monks so it's possible. 

Another factor is the Atlantic current that pushes warm water northeast from the Caribbean to northern Europe.
