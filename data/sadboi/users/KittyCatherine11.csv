My partner and I live in a 2 bedroom 3rd floor apartment in Colorado. I’ve been the one prepping for the pandemic and staying abreast of all the news. 

He’s said no to a gun. We’re not trained and getting a gun without training isn’t appealing to him. I feel like we are ok. I don’t want to be in a situation where I wish we had it, but for now I can wait. 

Now he’s saying no to a freezer chest. The issue is the size of the only one I can find. It’s large given our apartment space. Everywhere, as you know, is totally sold out. And might be for months. 

We’ve got a fridge/freezer in the kitchen. The freezer is small and just the top portion. I fit in what I can, but I feel anxious with predictions of meat shortages, as well as what can happen next. More plants closing down = less access to everything. 

I just don’t know what to do. It is larger than what I want, but it’s $200 and close by. Do I just wait until somewhere like Home Depot gets them in again at a size we want? Or at least HOPE I can be one of the lucky ones? 
He doesn’t think we’ll need it. That we can reevaluate as needed. I just feel food insecure for the future if that makes sense. 

I’m sure there were several people during the Great Depression who said “we won’t need it” and regretted it. But I also understand we’re in different times.

I(F) was about 9 years old? And two girls came up to me and started trying to make me argue with them. Now, I’d recently learned what “reverse psychology was” and thought it applied to this situation: they started telling me “ooooh you better not call her a Paki!” I had no idea what it meant, but the way they said it to me made me think it wasn’t a bad thing and they were trying to trick me?

AmItheAsshole,fjcdlz8,t3_fcl14r,1583216157.0,"A gentle YTA.  I understand why people are reacting so cruelly to you. 

But for just a moment, I want to give you some grace. The man you love has struggled for years and you’ve stayed by his side. You’ve loved him during one of the toughest things to get through — addiction. It’s a lot easier to leave someone who physically hurts you, but when he’s just unhappy and distant, you want to stay there to be there for when he’s finally free of this terrible thing. He isn’t hurting you on purpose; he’s trapped and you promised to stay by his side in sickness, not just health. 

And it has happened. Finally. Something you have dreamed of for years — your husband is back, safe, focused, and free of the shackles that kept him from you for so long. That have taken so much of your focus. You’ve been in protector and caregiver mode for a long time. 

Now also, she is your daughter. You brought her into this world, but she never got to be your world entirely because of his addiction. I imagine she must have suffered a lot to not want to accommodate her dad’s needs. She hasn’t forgiven him for being so absent, nor you for being absent and choosing him. 

But she also doesn’t understand the power of addiction. It isn’t just some mindset thing you get over. That’s why people keep track of just how long they have been sober, because one sip is all it takes to slip and lose yourself entirely again. It doesn’t go away. You’re not “addiction free” because it’s a piece of you forever. You just learn to control it. 

I don’t blame your daughter for being hurt. But she didn’t make it easy for your husband. She knows he’s a recovering addict but doesn’t have compassion for him. There’s a lot of pain there that I hope you all get to work out together as a family. 

It sucks, but this moment — this massive moment in her life, needs to be a reminder to you and your husband that this recovery is about ALL of you. It’s about you living your life with those you’ve likely neglected in exchange for helping your husband. It’s about your husband knowing his limits and sticking to them because of everything you’ve done for him and so he can live a much more fulfilling life. And it’s about creating new memories with your daughter — ones that don’t require the focus always being shifted onto her dad. It is a real shame that the wedding wasn’t the right moment, but it just wasn’t. 

This was a pivotal moment, but forgiveness provides more moments in time. Sometimes forgiveness comes from the person you’ve hurt, and sometimes it’s from ourselves for an unintended consequence. I hope it’s the former and your daughter can move past her pain, but just like you made your choices, she needs to make her own too for what is best for her own mental health and life. 

You might have lost your chance. The pain might be too much for her. But you can’t blame her. Alcoholism has many consequences. I hope you and your husband find a way to navigate those consequences together like you’ve shown you will always do."
AmItheAsshole,fjaie69,t3_fcddkb,1583174125.0,"NTA. the daughter is NOT separate from
his choices. She will live with a single mom because he chose to be unfaithful instead of a husband. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with being a single mom, but he took away her family before she was even born. 

Good luck OP. So glad you are brave and will stand up for yourself."

AmItheAsshole,fj3y2yc,t3_fba0io,1582995841.0,"Urgh. I’m a teacher and the way she spoke to you was wrong. 

We moved to America from England, and found out my youngest sister was pulled out of class to learn how to speak with an American accent instead of British. 

Like, what the fuck?

There are some shit teachers out there. Not because of their ability to teach, but because of their beliefs."

I’ve got beans, rice, and my next step is bottled water. I’m in Colorado and I’m a teacher, so my funds aren’t exactly great but I’d rather put a little extra on a credit card and be safer. Any suggestions you might have would be really appreciated. Things feel...foreboding."

But it won’t be as big of a turn out as it was to stop Hillary. That’s why I think Sanders can win. People hate socialism, but it’s not as tangible as a person. It’s not as threatening. Complacency from Trump supporters is his biggest weakness."

relationships,fiom7xp,t3_f8vj7k,1582585976.0,"Maybe have him watch a video of a woman giving birth so he can understand the trauma that a woman’s body goes through. 

Be absolutely over the top complimentary about her next time. “She’s a fucking goddess warrior for giving birth. Her body produced life and did what it needed to do to make sure that life was as healthy and viable as possible. And now her body provides life’s sustenance to that baby. What a fucking queen.”

He sounds oblivious to what it really means (which makes sense since he’s never going to give birth — also another reason why men shouldn’t have a say what we do to our bodies)

Educate him. If he can’t understand ...perhaps reconsider him? He’s being mean and hateful with his comments without understanding what it truly means to give birth. If he gets educated and still feels that way...eh. He wouldn’t be the one for me."

AmItheAsshole,fijgfmx,t3_f81asf,1582446787.0,"Did you tell her that you were still hungry and that’s why you’re eating something extra? She probably sees it as you “making it not-vegan” which is totally different and I could see how she’d be upset from that perspective. 

Best compromise would be for her to make more of the food or for you to make some vegan sides you can both enjoy on the days where it is less food. 

If it’s a matter of miscommunication, NAH."
Teachers,fhzohf8,t3_f5g9so,1582005624.0,"I just did a couple hours of work because I wanted to. I don’t work on weekends. 

To accomplish this, i get to work a little earlier and use that time, use any planning time I have effectively, have 20mins a week where students are on Moby max and I can do a little extra grading for them and return some work for them to view feedback. (Of course I will circulate too and check for understanding, but it’s meant to be self-guided). 

I also reduced the amount I grade. Some formative quizzes are for me to glance at. Submitted online through google forms instead of on paper. 

I check daily openers once every two weeks. If you don’t have one of the 2 I look at, you don’t get credit. 

I do stop and eat a lunch and pee so I can keep going when I return. Sometimes I stretch for a few minutes too to get my head out of the work. 

Our school has student aids. I use them for all the other things I would be doing. Highly suggest them for your school. They have to have a certain grade to be one. 

I stopped feeling guilty for having my weekend. I love my kiddos and do my best. But I love my weekend and don’t get paid enough to work extra. I’m a human with chores and desires to go outdoors and have fun. 

Don’t take the bag of grading home, you won’t do it. I never did. All it did to me was make me feel guilty."
Teachers,fhtjbav,t3_f4qq1c,1581874937.0,"Not a battle worth your energy. Keep teaching and focusing on the kids who are there, otherwise you’ll lose your love for the job and find that you only make time for the negative. 

If they’re honors kids, they’ll do fine on state tests. Those tests don’t actually test what a kid learned from us, but whether the district as a whole produces kids on grade level. 

You can only do so much, so go ahead and do great things in your classroom and love the kids who are there."
