AskReddit,fn9sto8,t3_g02lat,1586783680.0,"This happened last week. I was driving to my new house with my dog to drop off some boxes when my transmission blew in the middle of an intersection. Some strangers helped me push it to the shoulder and, after calling the police and my family, i sat and waited with my dog for the tow truck to arrive and my family
to come pick me up. we were out there for about 2 hours. leo was terrified of all the traffic and the loud trucks driving by. i had to tie him to the speed limit sign. a very kind police officer stopped by and gave me water for leo which i greatly appreciated. 

many mechanics stopped to help me figure out what was wrong with my car. many other people stopped by to check if i was okay and needed any help. i thanked all of them and told them i’m just waiting on the tow truck and my family at this point. 

after about an hour, this man drove up and told me how he’s driven by a couple times and saw me out here and figured i was hungry and thirsty. he bought me a chicken sandwich and fries from burger king and a bottle of water.

his act of kindness was the final one and i cried thinking of the dozen people who stopped to help a stranger on the side of the road. that day, though stressful, helped me regain faith in humanity."

natural action is something i’m starting to embrace more. for example, i’m in the process of moving out of my parents’ house and in with some friends. i was job searching in order to pay rent after losing my last one to the rona, but my car died while i was moving some boxes up. now i’m car searching. while this situation is a definite challenge for me, the stress isn’t as high as it normally would have been because of this understanding i now have that this is the natural way things have happened. rather than worrying too much about it because of the challenge, i’m taking it one small step at a time knowing that whatever happens will be the natural way of things. i’m doing my part and not focusing on what i can’t control in the situation. 

I love what you said about strategies over goals. i will definitely implement that into my life. it rids us of that extra worry and stress of not attaining our goals. and don’t worry about the wordy responses, you’ve been very helpful! i’ve learned a lot. thank you"
