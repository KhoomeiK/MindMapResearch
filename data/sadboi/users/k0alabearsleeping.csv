In general he‚Äôs a bad texter, people we know have said that and he admitted that he just doesn‚Äôt stick to his phone like glue or respond fast at all. Last time we talked he told me and didn‚Äôt reply fast was due to phone damage (he‚Äôs got the OG brick of an iPhone)."
Crushes,fmaf1eh,t3_ftyhiv,1585892028.0,Nope!! It‚Äôs an exclamation really. Guys I‚Äôve liked or dated use that. It‚Äôs a sign they are comfortable around you. I use it as well and I‚Äôm a girl lol. Have fun with it.
Anxiety,fl6dpmu,t1_fl6cetz,1584864184.0,"Exactly! Reading the symptoms of anything also don‚Äôt help, it‚Äôs like my mind projects it on my body. 

I‚Äôm been having to work harder then before to curb my anxiety. But I just have to distract myself even more now. Luckily my friends called and we did a video call and watch a movie. When I got up to get a snack, I realized everything I was feeling went away. 

So definitely distract yourself. Even if that bingeing Netflix or YouTube. Calling someone and just having a mundane convo. It will make a big difference."

Anxiety,fl30txz,t3_flvow6,1584765258.0,"Same here. I‚Äôve been really anxious the past few days and it finally hit me full force today. Heart palpitations, jitteriness, feeling like I‚Äôm doomed and upset stomach. 

I‚Äôve been drinking more water the past few days, plus orange smoothies and taking vitamins. But today I had some pizza and it just set my stomach off. Now I‚Äôm more anxious cause I have to keep going to the bathroom. I just want to calm down. I keep feeling like I have an on set of covid 19 symptoms, but I know that‚Äôs not the case. My breathing is good, no fever (even tho I‚Äôm paranoid and check every so often), no sore throat, no cough. If I feel a tingle in my throat I freak out. But I also suffer for allergies, and it‚Äôs been raining like hell where I am. So I‚Äôve mainly been sneezing.

Either way, I just want the anxiousness and this covid 19 to go away."

dating_advice,fio5i4i,t3_f8wss3,1582576687.0,"Hey, 

I (23F) totally get what your feeling. I went through something like this before and currently am . The first time was a guy friend who had a hard time getting over his ex back in is country. It had been 5 years since he seen her, but he felt shitty for leaving her. I began to have feelings for him, yet I noticed he dropped random info about her, or say that she was so pretty... etc. Now looking back I still pursued him when I should have stopped.

Even now with a new guy I like. He‚Äôs dropped two random comments about his ex and even showed me the apartment they used to live in together. So now I‚Äôm just paying attention to see what he brings up about her, at random.

My advice is to precede with caution. Pay attention to how often he talks or mentions her, or if something prompts him to talk about her. It will help you gage where he‚Äôs at emotionally. Six years is a long time and a lot of someone‚Äôs life you were connected to.

But also keep this in mind. Us girls have done the same thing too. I know I have. The guy I like right now, I used to talk about the previous guy I mentioned first to him a lot. I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôm over that guy and I‚Äôm moving on and that I have no time for games. But I‚Äôd still talk about him. Now it‚Äôs been 2/3 months since I last mentioned that guy to the guy I like now, because were are no longer in each other‚Äôs lives as friends.

When the new guy I liked started bringing up his ex, a red flag went off in my head, but I realized I spent weeks telling this new guy about my ex guy. So now I understand his pain, and process in trying to move on. 

Have empathy for him, regardless. Procede with caution. Pay attention to what he says and how. Give him room to breathe. Yet understand what you what and need right now. If he can‚Äôt give you that it‚Äôs ok. You don‚Äôt want to be his rebound. Let him find someone else for that. And if you really like him, He‚Äôs not going to fall for the rebound at the end of the day, trust me. I‚Äôve been the rebound for three years.

At best take a step back and be his friend at the end of the day. He will remember that more then anything and one day he‚Äôll realize you didn‚Äôt pressure him to move on, and you respect yourself to not throw yourself in his path. He will come around one way or another, as a great friend or more then a friend.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing with the new guy I like right now. It‚Äôs tough cause I like him, and he‚Äôs probably seeing some other girl. But I know I don‚Äôt want to be that rebound, and I hold myself to that. He‚Äôs still worthy of a friend and I can offer him that. Let‚Äôs see what happens."
dating_advice,finyh4p,t1_finu3tk,1582572733.0,"Omg! I‚Äôm going through the same thing. My co worker and I have that kind of relationship. We always banter back and forth, joke around and kinda flirt. He‚Äôs a really cool guy and I‚Äôve gotten to spend time with him and have gotten to know him better. He dropped the ‚Äú I love you bomb‚Äù, I feel kind of jokingly in the moment. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and I jokingly flipped him off, but it still sticks with me, cause he does things that really make him seem to care about me. 

Idk if he‚Äôs seeing someone else. Part of me hopes he is just so I can move on with that part of my life, but part of me just wants a chance with him. And he‚Äôs knows I like him lol, as I told him a few months back, idk if he just being nice. But there are so many moments that get me riled up. Ugh. It‚Äôs stuff like this that comes out of nowhere in life, and hits you and now I think about it all the time."
Crushes,fgnmcik,t1_fgmlpbo,1580947974.0,"I thought about it. But I already told him I liked him back in August. Things were awkward for about two weeks. But then we started talking and texting more and he‚Äôd take me out to eat. 

Nothings been said since then. I kinda feel like he should step up and say something."
dating_advice,fgd9hfc,t1_fgczn06,1580680198.0,"Thank you for **explaining your comment**. This makes a lot more sense, then the comment you made initially. 

I've been trying to get the courage to speak to him, just lately timing hasn't been well to bring it up to him on my behalf. I've been in a similar situation, but different variables, yet still lost a friend. Granted we gained a lot of respect for each other. 

I'm ok with talking to him, but again afraid to just loose enjoying the moment, which I never took the time to do in the past. 

Eventually, neither of us will be working there, and we won't be co-workers. Def, we would be friends outside of this workplace and already are.  My career is going to change paths come another 6months, possibly his too. Either way, I guess that's why I'm not so wrapped up in the environment."

dating_advice,fgcwbwo,t1_fgci4s0,1580676811.0,"Personally, I get it. But I'm not really concerned with the environment. Shit, people meet and date people all the time where they work. It's part of socializing. Id bee more worried if this were some corporate, high-end position I was in, but it's not.  We legit live in the same damn building, in case you didn't read the first part of my post."
