There is nothing of your list that makes you an incel. But maybe we can debate about hating when seeing girls enjoying their life. If you’re aware of this AND you’re fully convinced it isn’t justified to feel in a such way then this doesn’t make an incel either. 

Of course, let me remind you that the first thought doesn’t define someone, it’s the second thought that does. A lot of single people get jealous or angry when they see someone of the opposite sexe or a couple, it means nothing about them, these are involuntary thoughts...it’s only when they voluntarily start believing in such ideas that they become bad people (or incels if you want)

Something about this is telling me that this guy is trying to put the blame on you for losing his interest in you.

I know myself I might cancel a third date because the girl doesn’t seem interest, but if she texted me what you texted him then everything will be fine again for me."

Manliness is one of the important reasons of my depression if not the most important one, it’s all what plays in my mind, I always wanted to make a post about it but I’m always too scared to post anything about mental health or my life here. 

There has been events in my life that made me so aware about the inadequacy of the man I’m...I always say in my mind that I’m not man enough, I firmly believe that I deserve my depression and my self-hatred because I’m not man enough, that because of it : I deserve not to be loved by a woman, I deserve not to have friends who really care about me, I deserve to be viewed as less.

I do efforts to become the man I want to become, it’s been years...but when certains situations come I realize these efforts were for nothing, and I only sink deeper in my depression (makes sense). 

I can talk about anxiety...men shouldn’t be anxious, but here I am constantly one of the most anxious persons in the rooms I step in..my efforts consist of stepping in any anxious situation and never avoid them (I beg you not to call it courage, it’s not courage, not at all...it is simply not caring about 99.5% of things in life that helps me) and it always results in me making a fool out of myself when anxiety shows itself in another way because my voice was shaking or I was standing in a weird way or I didn’t say the right things or I got beaten (verbally or physically) or whatever. 

And what I suffer with manliness isn’t represented by anxiety alone, there are a lot of other things that I do and aren’t manly (enough).

I believe deep inside that a man can be whatever he wishes, and behave as he wants, but I know that my beliefs won’t change anything about society. For instance when I say men shouldn’t be anxious : this is not my opinion, I’m just quoting society.

One can tell me I shouldn’t care about society, but nah...surroundings, friends, girlfriends, they all are a part of society. And none really values difference, if you don’t fit in society’s definitions of things then you’ll be the lonely nerd none wants to interact with, no matter what you say about yourself. 

God I wish if in another world the things I don’t like in me were accepted, but in this one they are not, and I should fit in this world’s rules because they certainly are the truth since majority and intellectuals and people I admire(d) believe in them. (Yes I admit that I’m wrong when I say I believe deep inside men are free to be what they want.)"
