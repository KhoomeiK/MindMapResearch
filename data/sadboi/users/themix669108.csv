Seeing him move on to belong to someone else may trigger some feelings that totally have nothing to do with you, they just need to get used to the idea. Myself and my friends are lucky to have good relationships with our families but we each experienced our parents shutting down on us when moving in with our SO, getting engaged, getting married, getting a house, etc. Each stage is just their child getting that much farther away from them. In every situation, it took even up to a year sometimes but they eventually just matured up and accepted these basic life milestones."

You were there for her because she's your friend and you wanted her to have a special day, not because you considered it an investment and she would owe you one day.

It's not the same as playtime with other dogs, but it means he is pooped enough to sleep soundly while we work during the day and gets puzzle toys in between naps and walks.

However, I also knew I could count on around ten middle age family members, so added about that amount in the $100-$200 range. It was exactly as I planned, my friends sprung for $40 gifts or less, or went off registry to give me something personal or handmade. Family wrote checks for a few hundred or bought the bigger items, but none surpassing a few hundred.

weddingplanning,fpkag12,t3_gdx9u0,1588691073.0,"I think it depends on your FH's relationship to this large group of people. Through his hobbies, my husband has many casual friends, friends-of-friends who are all just part of ""the group,"" friends from high school, from college, etc. He thought that they all needed an invite. I know that he barely knows many of these people and we were on a strict budget with my own family working two jobs to pay for the venue/catering, and his family was already about two thirds of our guest list so far.

 I told him that this, to me, is truly an intimate event, meant to be celebrated by those who have watched both of us develop as people through the years, and know us as a couple and are excited to witness this milestone. Because of that, I myself was only inviting my most intimate friends, even if it meant some members of ""the group"" were excluded.

 I asked him to reflect on that, and really think - how many of these people had reached out to him personally in the past year? How many people has he made the effort to spend time with in the past year? I also was firm that I didn't want to be meeting anyone for the first time at our wedding (unless it was a date of a close friend). If they hadn't been important enough to meet in our five year relationship, they probably could skip the wedding.

 The number went down significantly after that. It comes off as harsh in a post but really it was a nice moment of reflecting on who has truly made a difference in our lives and appreciation for that love. It comes down to budget and what you both really value in a friendship."

The length of the video does not change, so you have an approximate as to how much time to put aside and having another voice to guide you can make the prayer a little more disciplined for you as you start out.

I really recommend that you work on your stress and anxiety first once you get back on your feet, before taking in a dog (also, you said your apartment doesn't allow dogs?). I say this because I have a mental disorder and it was recommended to me by those close to me and even professionals to get a dog. 

For over a year after getting my dog, my mental health had never been worse, because the stress I placed on myself to be the best dog owner I could was crippling, between the disorder and between the fact that dogs can't overtly express their needs and feelings. I always felt like a failure and like the dog was paying for it. None of this was the reality, but it added so much more stress than I anticipated.

It also depends on the dog. My dog was rescued and likes his independence, rather than being a constant snuggle companion for comfort. So, the dog can't also be assumed as a panacea because dogs have personalities and quirks as well.

I personally think that taking care of yourself is number one, and once you feel proud of what you have accomplished you can celebrate with a new furry friend!"

It would be hard to invite one without the other, but maybe you can just really draw the distinction between immediate family and girlfriend to minimize how much interaction there is and maybe minimize drama. For example, if you are doing rehearsal and dinner, I don't think it's unreasonable to not invite your mom's s.o., especially if there will be a lot of people there who have never met her. If you are bringing family to take pictures, she can stay with other wedding guests for that too; she won't be in pictures so it'll be awkward and boring for her to just stand around. In terms of seating arrangements, just seat her and your mom as you would any other guests, without distinction.

Find a special spot for fireworks and bring her a snack and play games while you wait. Buy a bottle of wine and drink it together, even at a value resort it's just as sweet. Figure out in advance when and where her favorite characters will be so you can snap photos. Another great idea people do for kids but I think would be just as cute for an adult her first time - save money by buying Disney themed souvenirs she would love from cheaper retailers BEFORE the trip, stash them in your suitcase, and surprise her with one each day to cut down on merch expenses. TBH I don't really like the food at WDW so to me a pbj and a cocktail (which ARE worth the money) and a nice view is better than table service any day.

1) customer support/customer relationship management in a large company: I know many people who were hired with little experience at even things as basic as call centers, but employers liked the psych degree. They kept their numbers high and were promoted or found outside jobs up to account management, account executive, project manager, etc.
2) Sales: again, with a big company, not a floor job at the mall. You'll start off small but if you keep your numbers going internal promotions or higher commissions are not uncommon.
3) recruiting: these jobs are not too difficult to get and some have decent starting salaries with commissions on top of it, and larger ones have advancement to management positions.

The most important part is that these will require WORK. A psychology degree is not super marketable so you will have to really really go the extra mile in another career to achieve the lifestyle you want. I also suggest scaling back on the expensive tastes; in college money seems endless to throw around, once you are sincerely working for a living, you'll want to hold onto those hard earned dollars until you've moved upwards."

Obviously people are only going to post the best photos, what is ignored are all of the financial struggles, sleepless nights, emergencies, tantrums, arguments at home, etc, etc.

 I've even seen a person post an adorable filtered and obviously staged pic of their little boy in a hospital gown holding the moms hand, walking down the hallway in the colorful children's ICU - after the child needed reconstructive surgery because the child's alcoholic grandpa who they were living with wasnt properly containing the pit bulls he bred and it viciously attacked the child. But aw, how cute, the little hospital gown and holding mommy's hand!

Again, this is purely anecdotal, but most students I know who graduated with those degrees were hired faster than the majority of students post graduation. I also do not expect demand to go down. A strategy I encourage students to use is simply go on Indeed and search for jobs that would require those skills or that degree.

Especially because it's becoming a trend to have bridesmaids wear different colors, so just differentiating the blue/green doesn't really signify much when you're in a big group."

I have a friend older than me who has a lovely husband, a nice little suburban house in a good town with good careers, two beautiful daughters. Her secret? They count pennies to afford these kids. Literally down to the spare change. Is that the life you imagine for yourself? These are the things people won't confess. A family member of mine got pregnant which kept her in a lousy marriage way longer than it should have, and she dumps the kid on whoever she can as often as possible. Obviously NOT a very fulfilling situation. You aren't alone in your doubts, we have biology fighting us. But count your dollars, count your free time, and imagine it escaping you and wondering if you would be happier than you are now. Don't count the clock either - IF you ever REALLY decided you wanted and could afford a child, adoption is so important. Don't put yourself on a timeline.

Cliche: dogs are amazing and taking in a rescue will save a life and give you the unconditional love a child could never guarantee."
weddingplanning,fove1rx,t3_g8resp,1588099755.0,"Aquaturf in Southington! Gorgeous grounds so ceremony/pictures/reception can all be done without leaving the property. Less than 15 minutes away from multiple hotels, food is delicious and included, as are linens, etc. I think they even have a default centerpiece you can choose to include as part of the price. Closer to BDL than a lot of places on the shore/northwest corner. Very fair pricing, we got an amazing deal having our wedding during the day on a Saturday. 125 people came in around 10k with cocktail hour charcuterie, three courses (seconds available!), and open bar. Love that it was a central location that had everything on-site and we didn't have to go beyond florist, photographer, cake, and DJ for vendors or rentals. Guests loved grabbing a drink and wandering around the gardens and fountains. Staff was amazing. They even brought a cheese and drink table outside for all of us involved in the wedding photos. Tons of parking and attendants directing people. This was during early summer."
weddingplanning,fov4apa,t3_g9euax,1588095149.0,"My husband has alot more ""family and friends"" and they made up most of our guests. He easily could have added even more. My parents were the ones working two jobs to help pay for this wedding (as was I) so I wasn't crazy about him just inviting whoever on a whim or peer pressure. I suggested a rule that he agreed to - if you haven't talked to them in 8 months, they aren't invited. If he really wanted to use the wedding as a chance to catch up with long lost family and friends this wasn't the time. 

HOWEVER this is because we really were on a budget and had to be strategic with our guest list. If you have a liberal budget and affording these extra guests isnt a big issue, then I don't see it as a problem, as long as future spouse is ok with the cumulative number of people."
weddingplanning,fouopjt,t3_g9ks93,1588087852.0,"I completely sympathize and my entire heart reaches out to you. I also have a mental disorder and wedding planning absolutely destroyed me. This isn't about me so I won't get into details but I eventually just started yes-ing everything around me so I wouldn't have to think about it. The day-of turned out great and family, friends, and my husband were over the moon about it, but none of the decisions were really mine except for the ceremony (I am very religious and put my foot down about that, but no one gave any opposition). 

However, I made it clear that every decision that was made that was something I didn't want would be paid for by someone else, no exceptions. 

My best advice is four-fold:

1. Let people pay for things. Trust me, when the day passes you will be happy to have that money still in your savings. Life is much longer than a wedding day!

2. Strip down everything you can, and if it's something you don't want but someone else does and they don't take your suggestion the first time, let them do the work. Trust your friends to decorate well, let your husband pick out invites (we just did digital ones that linked to our wedding website), if your MIL wants to do food let her, I'm sure she won't choose poorly. Ask your friends to help research hen party plans, I'm sure at least one or two would be willing to help. Forget details like favors, etc.

3. Google docs and Google sheets are a lifesaver to communicate ideas with your fiance. You can share links, ideas, pictures, budget, etc, remotely. 

4. Your priority right now - not the wedding, but finding a good counselor you can trust, and someone  who lets you cry it out and listens. Your health is more important than anything! 

Good luck! This too shall pass. Just remember, ay the end of the day you will have a husband you love and a lifetime to be happy with him! That's all that matters."
weddingplanning,foula5g,t3_g9mjez,1588086122.0,"I won't be redundant, but I will say that every point made above it absolutely true. I think it also depends on how much you value your pictures - I am a true miser but great pictures were a priority and I knew that if I was shelling out for great pictures, I wanted to do them justice by looking my best and have no regrets. Also, alot of things can go wrong doing your own hair and makeup, and then where does that leave you? I rarely do my hair and use makeup but the artists were able to create a natural look that was still gorgeous beyond my wildest dreams. I've never felt so beautiful!

What I would really like to say - and this will hurt - do trials first. It will be another expense, but it's important to know the artists know in advance what look you prefer, what palettes work with your coloring and preference, what type of hair you have, etc.

Another big reason - I did a trial begrudgingly but realized I was allergic to the type of fake eyelashes they used in my trial. My eyes wouldn't stop watering and were so irritated. So, it was easy for the artists to just use a different type the day of. What a hassle if I hadn't done a trial and realized halfway through the big day that I could barely open my eyes.

Lastly, and this is just a vanity moment, but I loved knowing that between the hair, the makeup, the dress, and everything else I was the most beautiful girl in the room, and would stand out in memories that way.....and got compliments over and over, and not just because people were being polite :) I avoid being the center of attention, but on this one day it felt good to know I could strut."

dogs,foh28hj,t3_g7e9at,1587759697.0,"I caution against ""swapping"" out dogs. It's not like returning something to the store because you want a different color: expecting it to act the same, just this time exactly what you want. Dogs are all completely unique and act differently in different situations. It's not easy to label them and what you are told the dog is like may not be the case once in your home. There is no guarantee the next dog will be what you are looking for, and rarely does any dog come home with perfect leash manners. Just things to consider.

How long have you had the dog? There are many, many resources for teaching dogs to walk calmly on a leash, YouTube is a favorite place for a lot of people to start. With a little research you can also find some great no pull harnesses. If he is pulling alot now, a part of it is likely because he's been trained to expect to run on his leash, but he will learn new expectations once the routine is consistent. We use a command to let our dog know when we will be doing some running and when we are stopping our running.

Do you have a yard? Do you have a dog park nearby? My dog loves to run and luckily the nearest dog park is fairly large. I take him there for an hour and between chasing around other dogs and playing fetch he's running top speed the entire time. Doing this 2/3 times a week plus a few walks a day that I know are long enough to tire him out is more than enough for him - even if we aren't going at his favorite speed, he enjoys sniffing and exploring and the duration of our walks makes up not being the little Mr. Mach 5 that he is :)"

dogs,fnprg1c,t3_g318jo,1587150633.0,"Surprised only one person has mentioned this but check with local regulations first. Personally I've never heard of a recreation area besides a dog park where dogs are allowed off leash. This also includes most condo/apartment residences I've researched. Yeah, maybe you could assume these things aren't enforcement unless local law enforcement is present, but if your dog was off leash and got into any sort of trouble with another dog, human, or structure, you could get in big trouble sometimes.

That being said, long leads are the best, both for recreation and training."
dogs,fnpqryn,t3_g33b8z,1587150284.0,"Lots of people in my complex somehow have pits (it's a restricted breed in the complex, I guess not enforced or more likely they didn't file it properly with management). I KNOW trust me I do that this is purely anecdotal and not every situation at all, but the large number of pits I know definitely belong to people who are least capable of properly raising a dog. I watch them take the dog outside the building, let them relieve themselves, then literally drag them bag in on their chain collars that I guess look cool? Always wondered the appeal. No proper harnesses that would be comfortable or lend control to the owner. The dogs are definitely not being trained and socialized because they are viciously aggressive when they see another dog - probably also the result of all that pent up apartment life energy. I know that can be a lengthy process if they came from a bad home but I've known these dogs for years and seen no progress. I one time gave one of these pitbull owners a pair of my dogs nail clippers and offered to clip his pits nails because they were so long they were curled. 

Also, they are all named ""Monster"" and ""Bruiser"" and the like...really???? C'mon people. Stop feeding the stereotype. But that's just me being purely judgey.

How do these people even end up with these dogs? I know there are unfortunately plenty of irresponsible dog owners out there, but the only ones I've ever met have been pittie owners. 

Bright side: there is one woman in my complex who is a model pit owner i.e. she is just a good overall dog owner. I see her out walking her dog for what must be an hour or two a day in a comfortable no-pull harness. The dog walks calmly in front of her and for the most part just politely ignores other dogs and people.

If you anticipate you or your partner staying home full/part time or getting others to help manage your domestic workload then a dog is great to add to your family now. I know it's far in the future, but I agree with the sentiment above, if you anticipate any chance of having to re-home the dog five years out than I wouldn't take that chance."

Interesting article gauging expected crowd levels based on fast pass distribution - on the assumption that WDW is not actually reducing fast passes, and this is demand only. 

I am NOT an economist at all, so take this as pure opinion. The people who are most affected by this terrible economic situation and unemployment are not the people who frequent WDW, and that's just a fact, especially considering the exorbitant and consistent increase in cost. The people who can afford these regular vacations are the lucky minority that are receiving their normal or close to normal salary who were inconvenienced by the delay and will want to get their vacation asap, as well as annual pass holders. In these situations, the only thing stopping visitors is general nervousness surrounding the virus, but data also suggests there are many people who STILL don't really care. Plus, international guests who may be from areas not as affected by the virus and don't understand the severity and want to take a vacation asap as well. 

However, there has been much discussion in how WDW will practice safety measures while still remaining open - could be less filled rooms, less people on rides at a time, lower park peak capacity, etc. Also the FP issue mentioned in the article. May not make for the vacation you were expecting.

Tl;Dr WDW will always be busy"
