AskReddit,fj8q7aa,t3_fbrn0e,1583119432.0,Yes because I love my dog and want him to be with me for a bit longer even if it’s just five years

FriendshipAdvice,fibsl1t,t3_f7iaei,1582329131.0,"Don’t let it affect you too much, but I’d say stop planning trips or trying to be considerate of these people because they don’t seem to really be worth it"
manga,fibqxr6,t1_fi65liv,1582328043.0,Do you know any websites i can read it on?
BoJackHorseman,fhnf3kv,t3_f40yzm,1581725833.0,Right? I told my friend about it the other day and all she said was “wait so he’s a horse”? I guess i would say that it starts off good but gets more deep as the show goes on
therapy,fhjgqta,t3_f2n3jk,1581645797.0,"Oh I didn’t know that, I’m sorry he did that to you, I totally understand why you’re angry I went through something extremely similar a while back, at this point as cheesy as it sounds as time goes on you’ll feel less and less angry, this guy obviously had insecurities and projected it onto you by “calling you out”"
therapy,fhhyr2y,t3_f2n3jk,1581614402.0,"I recommend this. Stop expecting much from people, especially friends. I’m not saying you had high expectations, but even low ones can be broken. You still need expectations for your friends, but since this guy is an ex friend, don’t hold any expectation you had of him being a better person, he doesn’t matter anymore. It’s probably shit advice but i did that and feel a lot better, everyone is different though"
therapy,fhhw2sh,t3_f35iu0,1581612895.0,"No, I don’t think it’s wrong at all. I’m in the same boat of wanting a concrete diagnosis. It probably wouldn’t make your life easier, but it would help you manage better"
FriendshipAdvice,fhhv870,t3_f31s4m,1581612417.0,"I think she’s trying to prepare herself and get herself together so you don’t have to see her in a bad state. It’s probably  nothing against you, it’s probably because you both have been through a lot together, and since she’s already confided to you about her mental health she might feel like it’s unfair to load it onto you again"
AmItheAsshole,fg6xvg6,t3_ex640x,1580579409.0,"You’re not, you’re friend is not a friend she’s a toxic bitch, next time she pulls out your extensions you should pull out her real hair she’s obviously jealous of you if she’s trying to sabotage you. Find new friends btw because your friends are dumb as hell saying it’s also your fault"

Highschool_Help,ffqqlcw,t3_eun9gx,1580141346.0,"I would suggest trying to do it during school hours if that’s possible. Personally I feel much more motivated at school than I do at home. Try doing it in the library after school before you go home, or during any free time you have at school"

FriendshipAdvice,fdkowy2,t3_elvrg3,1578508098.0,"Call animal control even if it costs you your friendship, it seems like it isn’t worth being friends with someone like that anyway"
Highschool_Help,fdhmmwz,t3_el6khc,1578425870.0,You don’t have to. As long as you have the required credits it shouldn’t be a problem. I am also a senior and I take four classes so you should be fine
depression,fbze508,t3_ef4960,1577243692.0,Merry Christmas to you too :)
Highschool_Help,f8uhm0e,t1_f8s9sdb,1574829706.0,I mean I was just standing there not doing anything so I’m guessing she sent it to some groupchat to diss me

FriendshipAdvice,f6nvqr6,t3_ds1bgz,1573001230.0,"No problem! I know it’s a struggle now but In a couple months it will barely even matter! If they do try and spread rumors and whatnot my suggestion is to not confront them or even waste your time thinking about it! The same thing is happening to me right now but I’m doing hobbies I enjoy and surrounding myself with people who care about me :) it’ll get better, trust me!"
FriendshipAdvice,f6nj92d,t3_ds2ooe,1572992711.0,"Leave things the way they are. This isn’t worth your time, if she wants to end the friendship then don’t waste your time on her and move on, she obviously has her own issues if she easily ended a friendship like that. I’d suggest eventually ghosting the guy too, he doesn’t seem very trust worthy as a friend. Try and make new friends, it’s only the beginning of high school for you so you’ll have plenty of time :)"
FriendshipAdvice,f6n07y1,t3_ds1bgz,1572982466.0,"I’m actually also going through something similar! The opinions of your classmates doesn’t matter, if they choose to believe them and treat you differently based on what they’ve been told, then good riddance! You don’t need hive minded people like that. Cut those friends off because they’re not worth your energy, especially if they’re that immature to make fun of you and spread rumors. Make a choice and stick to it as someone else said, because in a year, or even a couple months, this won’t even matter. Keep surrounding yourself with people who are nice to you, and people who don’t know them and aren’t associated with that group."
Anxiety,f6j2ilo,t3_drc4by,1572888154.0,Same! If one issue is resolved my brain will find something else to be abnormally worried about
FriendshipAdvice,f6izm8j,t3_drjqfs,1572886856.0,"Yes. It seems like she had no interest in putting any effort into your friendship. People like that aren’t worth your time, and you can’t  wait for them to want to be friends with you, so moving on is the best option. I know it’s hard since you’ve been friends for a long time but it’s honestly good that she ghosted you because she saved you the time of having to deal with a shitty friend like her. Try and focus on your other friendships, or branch out and make new friends"
FriendshipAdvice,f6a9px7,t3_dqveeh,1572753843.0,"You’re not a bad person. She has some issues she needs to sort out for herself. Whether she gets help or not, you’re not obligated to stay by her side and be her therapist. Looking out for your own mental health first is a priority."
FriendshipAdvice,f6a2zab,t3_dqtcx8,1572751256.0,"Do you have other friends that don’t know him? I’d say try and put more time into those friendships, or try and make new friends. I know it’s hard right now, but it will get better. For your emotions, I’d say talking to a counselor would be helpful. Even reaching out through reddit is a good idea. It will be difficult and it’ll take time, but you’ll start to feel better. Try and get into hobbies or pass time by going out more."
depression,f6758ys,t3_dqlsbe,1572716587.0,Proud of you!
FriendshipAdvice,f66kxro,t3_dqkvbz,1572711883.0,"It’s not worth it. You shouldn’t try to chase after her, if she’s mad, let her be mad. I know it sucks but if she’s going as far as posting about it then she’s obviously childish and her anger is her problem, not yours. If she eventually wants to reach out then give her a chance."
FriendshipAdvice,f62f4mj,t3_dqc08r,1572658375.0,"If he dropped you so suddenly, he doesn’t deserve you. Don’t wonder what you did wrong, it’s not always your fault, he most likely has issues of his own if he could easily drop a best friend of 3 years just like that. Try to focus on yourself and focus on strengthening your bonds with your other friends! It’ll get better :)"
introvert,f614yzg,t3_dq5zci,1572633218.0,Same here but then I remember how exhausting that would be for me personally
