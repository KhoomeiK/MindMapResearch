depression,fnj468e,t1_fnhuo59,1586991625.0,exactly. it's a vicious cycle for me honestly.
depression,fn04c0o,t1_fn02k3g,1586535209.0,it's hard not to self pity and seek validation when you hate everything about yourself
depression,fn0422x,t1_fn02k3g,1586535077.0,"i never expected anything in return until recently when i reflected on everything. in retrospect, yeah i was overreacting and people don't treat me quite as shitty as i thought, but i was breaking down and realizing that i don't get as much help as i give frustrated me. is it selfish? yes. but it's hard to control those kinds of thoughts and think rationally when you're having a breakdown."
depression,fn01nf6,t1_fn01b67,1586533799.0,"i think my wording of the initial post is a little strange. what i meant was that i try my hardest to help as many people as i can, but when i need help i'm either ignored or thrown the same shit every time"
selfharm,flymbma,t3_frskb0,1585604837.0,late but i hope you were able to push through it and overcome the urges

SuicideWatch,fjbm7vv,t1_fjbgju9,1583196461.0,i cant stand living in my own body anymore. my self hatred has gotten so much worse over the past three years and it's too much. childhood trauma has fucked me over and my anxiety and depression are actual hell. i hate living like this and i want out.
depression,fimyewv,t1_fimxhmj,1582550956.0,"bit of both. actually, a shit ton of both."

SuicideWatch,fe8ochi,t3_eo5c2y,1578928541.0,"i dont want to get on and just hear people repeat ""you are loved"" ""this isnt worth it"" you know, the basic shit. obviously sometimes people dont really know what to do and thats just their go-to, but with professional organizations im not sure if its the same shit. do they get people who have also struggled? do the operators *actually* know what its like?"
depression,fdjwbwt,t3_elqwy9,1578489609.0,"it's hard to pinpoint the cause of certain breakdowns from moment to moment, but the main root is childhood trauma"
antidrug,f8ugds2,t3_dmteh9,1574828609.0,"thank god someone who gets it. im not confrontational but i will not hesitate to end any friendship or relationship of mine if drugs get involved. idk about you, but my feelings on the matter mostly stem from trauma involving my father, so i've seen first-hand what drugs do. they're inherently bad, they destroy."
feminineboys,f8re3s5,t1_f8rdwz4,1574738132.0,"well i'm 17, so i can't really do anything about it quite yet. as soon as i can move into my own place i'm going all out on self expression"
feminineboys,f8rdtk6,t1_f8rai0b,1574737936.0,everyone is judgemental and i would honestly probably be disowned

depression,f0huxf7,t3_d4yx4b,1568630817.0,"i'll post on my instagram vent about how awful of a night i'm having, sometimes going into detail about how hard i'm crying and how badly i want someone to be there for me, and they'll fucking like the post and leave it at that. fuck this bullshit"
socialanxiety,f0gfbde,t1_f0gdxfb,1568598683.0,"best of luck man, you can do it! being the friend of a friend makes it so much better"
socialanxiety,f0gbfrv,t1_f0gb5u2,1568596766.0,okay but it certainly doesn't help
lonely,ezn3vhg,t1_ezn37nx,1568000550.0,"idk, being 17 it just feels like i shouldnt be so worried about it since im still young, but i feel pathetic and lonely seeing happy couples at school or among friends. im so introverted and awkward when it comes to social interaction so i feel like i could never actually make the first move (which i should since im a guy)"

depression,eut75kt,t1_eut6efs,1564021278.0,"it's mostly negative music, but sometimes comforting songs can work too, like Secret for the Mad by Dodie. that one sticks out in particukar because it was the first song to ever make me cry, so i've used it pretty often. but like i said, most of the time it's negative and sad"
depression,eut32oh,t1_eusjeoh,1564018831.0,it's actually really comforting to see someone with my same problem. i thought i was weird for wanting to cry
depression,eut30gu,t1_eut2eer,1564018795.0,"i have a specific playlist of music that resonates with me. i sit down somewhere my family can't possibly hear me, often in the bathroom with the shower on, listen to the music, and just let it all out. sometimes i have to force the tears out but sometimes it's immediate, depends on the day really"

selfharm,etqat7m,t1_etq9bze,1563078033.0,"i would try that but i just wouldn't want to risk it, you know? mostly because my mom found out about my depression last year. she thinks i'm mostly fine now, but she'd be less inclined to believe something like that i think"
selfharm,etqap4b,t1_etqafnf,1563077927.0,"to me it's urgent. i have a lot of shit going on in my family life and learning that i cut and that im still not okay would make everything so much harder for everyone. please take into consideration the perspective of who made the post. in my current situation, it's pretty urgent. thank you for the advice though, i'll see if we have band aids. not sure if it'll look suspicious"
feminineboys,ethkee7,t1_ethk68x,1562818114.0,because im not. im comfortable being a guy i just also really like girly stuff

depression,essw8ji,t1_essvzeu,1562258634.0,like if someone sees several of my posts and wants me out of their tl becuase of how often im bitching and complaining
depression,essg6xo,t3_c8yq4w,1562251295.0,"i know exactly how that is. depression prevents productivity, people attribute it to ""habits"" and ""laziness"""

selfharm,esl5gb5,t1_esl4epj,1562079545.0,"how bad are the cuts? sorry that might seem a little too personal but if they aren't deep enough then there's a point where you could get away with not trying too hard to hide it. i would reccomend wearing the thinnest long pants you have for now, but at a certain point you could find ways to divert attention away from your legs. i've only cut on my thigh and inner arm, so i don't have any specific advice for it, but perhaps at some point you could try makeup? i don't onow how easy it would smudge but that's a possibility"
selfharm,eskvkvo,t1_eskv1tk,1562074423.0,"so many people just don't understand what depression is or what it does to you. ""oh you just have to think more positively"" ""it's all about your mindset"" like bitch i think it's a little more serious than that. but seriously though, i hope you're holding up alright. i also go for my legs because of how easy it is to hide"
selfharm,eskoc8x,t3_c87mvy,1562069964.0,"ive never understood the ""its for attention"" thing. most people who self harm try their best to hide it. how the fuck is that supposed to be for attention? in any case, i feel your pain. please hang in there"
