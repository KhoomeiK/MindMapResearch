I arrived after all this happened, they told me the story when I got there.

The point is, I was talking to my friends in the bar at like 4 am, it had been a few hours since I got there, and the conversation came up about this guy wanting to kill himself, and that he has to deal with this and man up... And I was drunk, so it triggered me badly to be honestly, but I kept my mouth shut, cuz I didn't want to start a discussion with my friends that I knew wouldn't lead anywhere...
