Nope, that is the price (I prefer to adopt, I have a beautiful adopted dog but I wanted the golden doodle too because I love the personality of that breed in general, they are really sweet)"

SuicideWatch,fkf4p0p,t3_f9d5go,1584126995.0,"Yes, I (23f) just want to stop existing, that's all, no heaven, no reincarnation, no limbo, nothing, just stop existing. 

the only reason why I'm still alive is because I don't want to hurt my family, I love them and I know that if I died they would react pretty bad, however some times I feel too tired of everything, physically and mentally, I can't enjoy what I used to like (food, being around my pets, videogames, art) even when I'm doing those things I feel really sad, people is always asking me if I'm okay, I try to act normal but they can feel it I guess, maybe some day it will be too much to handle and I'll make the decision to leave, who knows. 

I hate the idea of killing myself, an accident or a disease tho, that's why I wish I just could stop existing."

AskWomen,fbtpbqo,t3_eec78i,1577088713.0,"I used to wear makeup every single day, school days, to work, Sundays, to the gym... Then I met my husband, he tells me I look beautiful even when I don't wear makeup, when I wake up, when I'm cleaning, when I'm swimming in the pool..
 I think that means he restored my self confidence, still wear makeup in special occasions but just because I like to do it, now it's a hobby, not a necessity."
