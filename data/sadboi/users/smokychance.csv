AnorexiaNervosa,fqwsui6,t3_gl1f7k,1589716485.0,"Honestly. Throw yourself into Track. As an adult, you get so few opportunities to succeed and excel at something you love. Talk to your parents about food, don't compare yourself to you bro, he is younger and I assume not an athlete, you definitely need to eat more. Just make sure you put your mental health ahead of all of this. That don't let this disease take your athleticism away from you. Hugs"

fasting,fqr80o9,t1_fqr7u1w,1589579311.0,I think coffee can increase you chance of being constipated. Maybe try lime and water or apple cider?
fasting,fqr7u1w,t3_gkhwzs,1589579214.0,"Sorry you are having it so tough. For me, it takes 3 days before I can read ketones on the urine stick. It takes 24-48 fours for your liver to switch from glycolysis to ketones fatty acids, all though this process is gradual. Water weight will account for initial weight loss. Maybe this is what is happening, if you are retaining fluid. In all honesty I don't know because I am not a doctor. I always recommend fasting for longer period if you are healthy and have no underlying conditions. But once again I'm not at doctor. Good luck to you, if this is your first fast take it easy."

WeightLossAdvice,fqoofdg,t3_gk1wpd,1589520266.0,"Definitely sounds like a mental think. If you are to blow out you calorie budget for a day. You are unlikely to gain weight.

 In theory you could lose weight on a completely junk food diet, provided your intake was less then you maintenance calories. I often plan in a 1000 calorie burger meal it to ways. Say I was restricting to 1200, I would exercise 600 cal, a big workout but doable, 1800 cal allows me to have a 100 cal burger, no weight gain. The other thing I do is have one cheat meal a week. This works well with me as I know that the food I'm craving on the weekend. Also find it stops me binging during the week.

I think it's meant to junk food to a lifestyle you no longer want. Challenge that belief, you can have junk food once in a while without feeling guilty. Keep an eye on your belief though because it could be dangerous in the future.

Cheers"

I know this is really hard. But try to see how far you have come. Even if it hurts psychologically, physiologically you're doing so much better. A college degree is huge and even bigger deal when you're dealing with a disorder like that. I have so many traumatic experiences, some of them my fault through self harm. 

This sounds full on, but I had songs that I cut to, specifically Imagine Dragons, because I was in so much pain that I felt like it was the only way I could identify with anything. Now, so many years later, it still hurts a bit to play those songs. But I am not sent into the spiral I once was and that for me is a huge win. I have claimed these songs back for me, I can look back on those memories objectively.

I believe this will happen for you, it will take time and it will take pain. Something this disorder has not stolen from you is your identity. It is part of your identity, but is not all of you. And it has not stolen your future, don't let it. The future is yours, it needs you, your past does not. I have to remind myself that every single day. Wishes to you."
AnorexiaNervosa,fpy7ujk,t3_gg0i3x,1588997938.0,"My doctor explained something to me called starvation syndrome. Basically if you body is deprived of nutrients/calories it has this weird positive feedback loop that cycles not eating. Maybe this what you are experiencing? It can also change somebody's mood like anxiety or perceptions of self. Be safe all. Easier said than done, but get help if possible"

AnorexiaNervosa,fpql22s,t3_getu8i,1588825319.0,"Honestly only you know when you're recovered. But it sounds like you are still only eating to get people off your back rather than to survive or enjoy it.

 I also have eaten food only because I know I can burn off the calories. I also count calories obsessively but it's just part of my life now, it's like a number system that continuously runs through my head. I consider myself recovered, although I know that I am not completely and probably never will be. I can eat food because I want to enjoy it. I think for me that is a win. I'm not purging and my BMI is stable. I'm still drawn towards anorexia topics and body image topics. I still get jealous over strangers weight and Google the weight of numerous celebrities. But for now I think I've recovered... However I find that Ive started fasting again, it's just kind of happened and now I wanted to keep doing it, fuelled by the weight loss. But I think I've got control this time. Going back to that kind of mindset and weight will always be a delicious temptation. But I don't want to go back to that because of how bad it feels and how many people it hurts. 

So in regards to yourself, maybe ask yourself why are you doing this and what do you want? You love running, fuel yourself for that purpose. Not to lose weight but to run faster and harder and further then the you did last time.  I think another good way to tell is if you can talk about it with somebody. If you can't, you know it's because you are acting in a way that will cause you harm and cause people around you to worry. All the best to you and be strong"
