nespresso,fmgwyb2,t3_fv0ewr,1586060081.0,"Honestly the coffee quality is better. If you grind/open a regular bag of beans, they won't be as potent within a week. Nespresso capsules keep all of that fresh aroma and taste in! It's more economical in the long run even though the machine might be a bit more to start off with. The machine itself is a lot easier to maintain. Descale it every now and then, wipe down the inside, etc etc."

nespresso,flzll4o,t3_fs250q,1585626679.0,"Descale with the Nespresso descaler! The water might look fine but you never know. There could be some mildew somewhere or some old old leftover coffee grounds somewhere inside the machine. I'd stick to another way of drinking coffee until you get your hands on some. I'm sure it won't hurt you, but still lol."

nespresso,fkvlr1d,t3_fk6u0s,1584571805.0,Use the Nespresso descaling kit. It has lactic acid so it might get through the oil coating. Maybe also try letting some water with baking soda in it sit in the tank over night (don't run it through the machine tho).
nespresso,fkvlhqy,t3_fk3xmw,1584571652.0,"Hello! Boutique Specialist here. I assume you like mostly espresso? If so, the original line is definitely a good choice. For each machine, I highly recommend only using only Nespresso brand pods. They have a patent on the design of the capsules so the ones you buy from other sites or even the refillable ones may cause damage to your machine. I've had a bunch of customers coming in to troubleshoot their machines. I'll go through a bunch of questions as I'm playing around with their machine. The ones who tell me they use mostly off-brand pods. You can find the blends you like with our product. I love bringing people over to the tasting bar and helping them find a bunch of new favourites! Not to mention, our coffee quality is probably the best out of our competitors and other pod brands. I hear many times a day that once you get used to the quality of your machine, it's hard to drink anything else lol.   


Anyways. The Essenza/ Plus are great and my favourite of the entry-level machines. You could throw those things at a brick wall, plug it in, and it would work just the same lol. Pixies are great too! They are durable and I haven't seen many customers come back with issues. Just don't be too rough with closing the handle. You can bundle any machine with one of the aeraccinos if you like to make cappacinos and lattes.   


If you wanna spend a bit more and you like milk-based drinks, the Latissima Touch or Pro are AMAZING. We use them a lot in my store. We've had it in the store since September and make at least 100 drinks per day with it. It still works like a watch. So many drink options and the removable milk container is nice. Latissima 1 is really nice as well. Smaller and good if you're tight on space.   


When you sign up online or in store, make sure to say yes to emails. Nespresso has many great promos monthly that usually include free cups and stuff, but we only have major sales (ie. machines and coffee) a couple of times a year. It's good to have notice of those. On your first purchase, you will be asked about the welcome offers. You save a bit on the espresso sleeves and get a free gift. It seems like a lot at first but the capsules don't really expire and it's nice to have different roasts to play around with. If you buy online only you don't have to worry about placing another order for a while.  


Last but not least, if you do have a boutique nearby, feel free to come in and ask questions. We are fully aware of how overwhelming everything can be when you first start off and are prepared to help. No question is a dumb question. Best of luck!"

Brampton,f0xohoa,t1_f0x6hsy,1569039787.0,"YUP!! I remember learning about crime stats in first year Crim courses. Specifically, how it’s not as bad as it’s made out to be. A lot of us are on facebook, reddit, watching the news etc etc and the stories keep getting replayed and repeated. It makes people have a heightened sense of awareness and fear. The fight-or-flight reflex gets going and doesn’t wind down cause the news or whatever it is perpetuates the cycle. Our logic goes out the window because acting (fight or flee) has a better outcome (survival). Sidenote, this is also where a lot of reliance on negative stereotypes or racism can peek in for some. 

ALSO.
Bad stuff is being televised more because it gets more views than ‘local kid organizes clean up crew for park’.  Not to mention, it ‘feels’ worse now because we have easy access to the internet and media DAILY. It wasn’t like this ten years ago. Shit was going on back then too, but it was more difficult to hear about it. It also wasn’t broadcasted 24/7 on all platforms. 

Hopefully by presenting this topic more objectively, some people feel a bit better. Thank you for stating this!"

Violence exists EVERYWHERE. It is worse in areas due to various socioeconomic issues that are much deeper and more difficult to fix than some people understand. In fact, it just further perpetuates the cycle. The only thing close-minded comments show, regardless of their apperent superior education and morality, is that they only care about themselves. As a community we need to stand together to not only support people who may need it but to collaborate on productive ways to prevent this stuff from happening in the future.
