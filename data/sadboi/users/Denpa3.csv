Boil water and cook noodles until al dente, that is, firm to the bite. Meanwhile, you can use storebought sauce in a jar and mix with storebought frozen meatballs. Put the sauce and meatballs together in a saucepan or even a microwave bowl. To get the best flavor from this, mix the sauce and meatballs together in a saucepan an hour or two in advance and let simmer on the stove on low heat. Stir occasionally. When you're ready to serve, spoon some sauce and meatballs over the pasta and don't drown the noodles.

You need to redirect your inner (semen) light to climb upwards the spine to your prefrontal cortex. Besides that, you gotta find a hobby or a passion to transmute the energy into. I know some potent herbs & medicine that will be a huge help on the path. Are you even conscious about your breathing patterns? Find solace in knowing that this is a solvable problem, others struggled with what you went through but it doesn't have to continue.
