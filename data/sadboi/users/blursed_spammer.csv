depression,ffhes7b,t3_d9f2m4,1579932252.0,"Fuck. Im literally crying while writing this. I had all As in school until the second nine weeks when i had a major wave of depression. I just... stopped doing things, and my grades in both my English classes fell to Fs, because they were the only ones I had to try in. My family is above average on the wealth scale, so i mainly get the things I ask for for my birthday/Christmas or whatever. I had all the things I wanted, an xbox one, a nintendo switch, fuck, i even recently got a 55 inch tv that my mom got for cheap. She was going to give it to my fatass dad who sits on his butt all day watching cooking shows, but he said that ""if it was that cheap, it must be bad."" So my mom gave it to me. And sience I had 2 Fs, i couldn't use it until I got my grades up. But I didn't try to. I lied to my parents about asking my teachers for extra credit opportunities because i have social anxiety. So i basicly self sabotaged being able to do everything I ever liked about being alive. Social media. But luckily, my dad gave me his old phone that summer, so i have a source of screens. 

I fucking already was super depressed, but i had to go self sabotage the one thing I liked doing in life. fuck me."
