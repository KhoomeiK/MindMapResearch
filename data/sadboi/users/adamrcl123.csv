LSD,fbkj9fk,t1_fbjbffu,1576951240.0,"Lol its bound to happen. Gotta remember that LSD gives you just as much junk as it does insight. 

You only really get out what you put in. 

So someone looks a little stupid when they're tripping face. Laugh about it man, no need to get all deep."

I swear the longer I  go without tripping the more I want to but it becomes more daunting with time. 

Like ehhhh do I really wanna jump down the hole again??

Yep... I do"

Most of my trips have always been very geometric and sharp, either that or like somebody just poured straight tie dye into my eyes and I just sat in a kaleidoscope world for the duration of the peak lol."
mentalhealth,f110yvk,t1_f10ti08,1569119751.0,"The difference is what's so upsetting to me I think. I mean it kinda feels like I'm just building this life up so it can crumble away and leave nothing behind.

I've always wanted to be a father, I want the chance to be even half as good a father as mine was to me... and that may never happen but that's a completely different story. And even that may change but SO little is guaranteed in life ya know? 

Besides that I have horrible self esteem so that just makes me feel even more worthless and meaningless.

God I sound so pitiful lol... but seriously, I gotta get some of this off my chest... even if it's just to random people online. 

Soon, hopefully, I'll be able to see a therapist but until then I'm just kinda grasping for anything solid... sounds fucked up from a guy whose just about to get married right?"
mentalhealth,f10rkxm,t3_d7gcwp,1569116421.0,"Inhale. Exhale. Seriously I'm not being a smartass.

Look around you. Name a few things, make physical contact with something. Touch. Taste. Smell. Hearing. Reconnect with your senses a bit. That might help center you.

You are alive. You would not be reading this any other way. 

You're alive and priceless."

mentalhealth,f0ywnvn,t3_d7c0s8,1569080509.0,"Feeling down about your situation is fine and totally normal. 

I think what people mean is ""instead of feeling sorry for yourself, put the work in to improve your situation""

When you're in the pits of depression that's one hell of a challenge in itself but the main point is never settle if you're not happy. Find the strength to sta d up and keep fighting"

I've wondered a thousand times if I'm just a ball of unresolved hidden trauma. My childhood was... different? But not necessarily bad, just troublesome. For that reason I'm not sure if I was actually traumatized by it all or not.

Get some help if that's something available to you. I plan to eventually once my insurance kicks in. Until then, good luck, hang in there.

Everybody's got their demons but ultimately everyone can be beautiful once they find out who they are."

Skin is skin, blood is blood. We all live and die the same fuckin way, so race or nationality doesn't mean a damn thing when it comes to your significance as a person. You deserve help just like anybody else does."

mentalhealth,esc5fka,t3_c6z9yc,1561821429.0,"Honestly, don't gamble with your mind. If you're having trouble, my absolute best advice is yeah, go talk to a doctor. At best they'll get you back on track,  steer you more towards ""happy"" and you'll be all the better for it. Even if they dont, then at least you got evaluated.

Im saying this as a 26 year old whose dealt with anxiety and depression since before I was old enough to understand what I was feeling.. I just kept putting my mental health off because I figured I'd be fine. 

Don't be me lol, get yourself some help, there is nothing wrong with that"
Advice,esc4cgx,t1_esc372m,1561820664.0,"Weak? Nah. If you were weak you wouldn't even bother seeking help. 

Since you're here and making at least this much of an effort, you still got fight in you. 

I really do hope things work out for you. Dont just roll over and die, take back control of your life, find supports, take steps towards growth, love yourself, and recognize that you're the one who is ultimately in control of your life.

EDIT: feel free to hit me up if you need a shoulder. (you or anybody else) Dont fight alone."
