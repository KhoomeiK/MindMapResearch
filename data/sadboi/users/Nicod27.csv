COVID19_support,fp0umtc,t1_fp0tc92,1588217297.0,"Again, it’s not feasible nor appropriate to require everyone to wear a mask until a vaccine is found. If a county hasn’t reported a new case in a month, there is no reason to keep the mask requirement in place. If we use the logic you are suggesting, then masks should be worn for the rest of time because someone in the population might have a disease that they can spread to others that may prove fatal. My wife works in the ER as a PA, and each year they get lots of flu deaths. While yes we can treat the flu, it can still be quite fatal. However, we don’t require masks bc someone might get it from someone else. 

In terms of testing/spread - Listen to what Gov. Cuomo of NY has been saying in his briefings. Once the transmission rate drops to a certain level, it will mean that community spread and transmission has dropped, hence wearing masks is no longer needed as your chances of getting it and/or spreading are drastically lower. Sure, the chance is still there, just like it is with many other diseases we can treat but can also be fatal, but we don’t make everyone wear a mask based on that small chance. We aren’t there yet, but we will be."

Unless everyone in the world gets together at the same place at the same time without masks and infects once another, it won’t be nearly as bad as the second wave of the Spanish flu.
