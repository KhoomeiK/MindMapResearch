A good portion of you seem to have dated in the past, had at least some contact in the past, and it all failed, and you're losing hope. I'm sorry you feel the way you do, I really do, but I will never, *ever* understand what the fuck you're talking about.

Someone chose to be with you for some infinitesimal amount of time for some reason. What the actual shit makes you think that can't happen again? Clearly there's something about you that people do appreciate. Remember, 1% of the earth's population is still about 70,000,000+ people.

This problem never has (clearly) and never will consider you. You aren't inherent trash, you weren't cursed or whatever, you just aren't at the best part of your life. He'll, maybe this is the worst part your life will ever have one way or another. For that I'm genuinely sorry.

But fuck you for thinking you are inherently unlovable *after* life has shown you that you aren't. 

What's that? You never dated anyone because you were too self-conscious? That's not you being inherently, perennially unlikable, that's you being self-conscious and pushing away life's offers (good or bad) stop thinking that these 2 things would ever be on the same page of a Venn diagram.

I don't know if it's truly ""better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all."" The very inherently subjective nature of that statement means no one will ever actually know. My red may or may not be your green.

But don't you ever fucking dare try to tell me that because you were dumped again, you will feel the same way I do knowing that I will never even touch a girl's skin. Don't tell me you know the feeling of being so intrinsically abhorrent inside and out that a girl (gender of your choosing) would rather tell everyone you tried to rape her when you never even touched her and just told her you might like her. Don't tell me you know the feeling of being unlovable written into the very fabric of your reality unless you really do, because *if someone has liked you before, someone will like you again.* 

I'm sorry, I know I'm an asshole but you absolutely positively do not get to tell me that ""I'll find someone"" (though at this point I doubt you think I will either). You do not get to tell me that I ""don't know what life has in store for me"", because until and unless you can guarantee with 100.1% certainty that my life gets better, the only thing you should and need to do is shut your horseshit spewing mouth.

And to those of you truly in the same/similar positions as me, I'm sorry. I'm really, genuinely, truly saddened you've been cursed into a life of eternal torment and loneliness too. I don't have any answers for you other than death."

SuicideWatch,esiypuf,t1_esg15lj,1562022766.0,"I suppose I don't really believe in destiny/fate/whatever in the sense of things that are bound to happen. I've just realised there are facts of life, inevitabilities, that are fundamental truths that reality is based upon. V=IR kinda thing, an inherently unchangeable fact. The only way I can increase impedance while decreasing voltage is shooting myself and hoping I end up in another world where the fundamentals are different (ok this analogy is getting out of hand but still)"
