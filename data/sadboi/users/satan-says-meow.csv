When I first landed in hospital for SH, I was put in a really shitty situation (they put me on a childs' cancer ward, at 15, waiting for surgery on a self inflicted wound, seriously) but there were a few nurses I will always remember for how they reached out to me during that time. One young nurse saw how mentally unstable I was so found my parents a separate place to sit and just talked with me about music. She took time out of her day to settle my mind and that really helped. Seeing her again when I relapsed really made me see I had to get clean, the disappointment/sadness in her eyes hurt so much. I've been clean (apart from minor relapses) for just over 5 years now, part of me still does it for the people like that nurse who took time to be a nice person to a random, depressed teenager. Remember that nurse."

selfharm,flcukkn,t3_fnz3zm,1585047181.0,"Okay, might as well tell my story about this. Warning: kinda obvious it will reference self harm but also an abusive relationship.

Around the time my self harm was at it's height, I fell for a girl I'd met at a gig (mutual friends, I stayed at her place that night due to where the gig was). We lived a fair distance apart (4 hour train journey, in a small country that's a long way) but started chatting online. I told her about my self harm and the ""you cut, I'll cut"" discussion took place. At this time, I was dealing with some real heavy stuff but I couldn't tell a lot of my past trauma, I was the most vulnerable I'd ever been, so I agreed. And I relapsed.

This is part of a much bigger story of how shit went wrong, she caused me a lot of trauma (not entirely her fault but I've struggled to accept that she was very abusive to me at points) but that night will stick with me, it's the first time she took advantage of me. The guilt I felt is part of the reason I stopped, it took a few years for me to rationalize that the ""you cut, I cut"" idea may come from a good place but it's such a toxic idea. She left my life for good 5 or 6 years ago, I struggle to think about that time and I still get flashbacks to certain incidents. That night fucked me up when it comes to trust and relationships. If you are currently self harming and someone starts this shit, let them know kindly that is will make you feel worse if anything, they probably don't realize it."

Everyone recommends bio-oil but it's really expensive for what it is, I use a combination of pure vitamin E oil & cocoa butter cream, which so far (been creaming/oiling regularly for 2 years, irregularly before that) has worked a dream.

He's an asset to the company but I think making him a part time commentator, coming in for PPVs and big matches would be great but hearing him mis-pronounce Japanese names, not being familiar with debuting wrestlers (the butcher... the blade...) and slightly outdated verbiage (oriental) is kinda painful."

This moment had me feeling like a child before I realized wrestling was a work, the real life drama adds so much and, while everyone wants a Shibata return, I'd rather have him around for spots like this & training in the dojo than him risk his life to wrestle again."
OSWReview,fcmztbl,t3_ehvtfo,1577799015.0,"Honestly I'm loving this story arc. Each to their own but the New Gen is filled with so much cartoon-ey bullshit it's perfect for OSW, Survivor Series 93 might be one of my favourite episodes in ages. I'm along for the ride, I got into wrestling during the ruthless aggression era so looking back at the post Hogan years is super interesting for me. I love Lex, any match from any Hart (even the shit ones) and the heaps of shit like Men on a Mission (mainly Mo)."
UnresolvedMysteries,fciaf38,t3_eh7qmr,1577659729.0,"For everyone who need a little clarification, Teddy Hart is an somewhat infamous indie wrestler. He's got a bad reputation (as you can kinda see with the stints in jail) and has been a controversial figure for years. He's from the Hart family (Bret Hart's nephew, it's a big family) and is often seen as the black sheep.

About the cat thing, I can't really explain it other than the family has a reputation of being obsessed with cats, Teddy more than the other family members too. He has cats as part of his gimmick, brings cats down to the ring with him, puts them on the turnbuckles (I haven't seen this while a match was going on, only during his entrance.) etc. Not a frequent browser here (but may be now), I came from /r/squaredcircle. I've heard rumors about Teddy Hart for years and only heard his take during shoot (not in character, wrestling term) interviews until this. Hope some of this is useful in some way."

SquaredCircle,fc9l1w7,t1_fc934g2,1577554253.0,"If both like somewhat logical booking (somewhat for AEW more than NJPW), NJPW would squash 3/4 of the AEW roster. They're more established names and have a stronger history that's easy for fans to seek out.

I'd love a relationship between the 2 companies, but I wonder if now is too soon for any kind of angle. I think giving Kenny opponents he's more familiar with and can deliver magic would get him crazy over but an angle would kill either or both companies credibility. You can't have 20 year veterans from NJPW putting over relatively new indie stars (obviously not talking about any of the big stars in AEW)."

The Hulkamania storyline is fun to watch through, you can see OSW becomming the show it is today towards the end (pacing, running jokes, more comfortable being recorded). No Way Out 2001 is my go to ""I need some background noise that's familiar and funny while I do something"" podcast. The Christmas episodes this year have been fantastic too."
njpw,fc093s1,t3_efe91c,1577283580.0,"Honestly love this. I feel pretty much the same way, it's really nice to be biting for storytelling as a hardcore fan. I can't confidently guess many of the results which is impressive, the build to WK has been incredible this year IMO. The KENTA/Goto story has been built brilliantly (and of course I had a little less investment in KENTA as a character because of how recently he debuted) and the main event scenario feels brand new despite being an old idea (take your pick throughout wrestling history).

This is what wrestling is about, getting people who've been watching for years truly invested. This is what solid booking and the best in ring wrestling can do."

I can see Ibushi winning the HW title within 2020 but not just yet, Jay White is an interesting one though, it would be very typical Gedo to swerve everyone and have him win it all. My heart says Naito but my head is split between Naito and White, Naito needs the win though (insert someone complaining about being a Goto fan)."
SquaredCircle,fbtupu2,t3_eefoat,1577096901.0,"I'd recommend seeing some excellent Tanahashi matches. He is such a good example of a strong style, NJPW wrestler. I'd say his match with Evil from this year's G1 was one of my favourites (not a super hyped match at the time) plus I think that was on the same night as Will Ospreay vs. Zack Sabre Jr, another fantastic match showing some of the other styles at play in NJPW.

Jay White's match against Okada from Wrestle Kingdom was great, the finishing exchange is amazing and shows what White is capable of. I'd also recommend Ishii vs. Takagi, just big lads beating the shit out of each other, and Sanada vs Okada (both from the G1). Sanada vs Okada is almost perfect, Sanada is smooth as butter and of course Okada is equally so, the finish is beautifully booked and executed (won't spoil it, commentary does a stellar job explaining all story etc too). Getting into NJPW is one of the best decisions I've ever made and what a time to start, all of xmas to become familiar just in time for WK."

selfharm,fbsnrtn,t3_ee95o2,1577057724.0,"I can not stress how much getting tattooed semi-regularly (as often as I can financially) helps me. It relieves that itch and some nasty spots that I've had tattooed felt eerily similar to cutting (the nasty spots in question are elbow and just under the back of my knee). 

Getting tattoos to me represents a few things; relieving my itch for self harm, collecting great artwork and becoming who I feel I really am. I've felt like I should be a heavily tattooed person since my early teens at least and now I'm 22 and have a serious start to my collection I feel a lot more present and really more human. My self confidence may still be crap (physical disability doesn't help) but I feel so much better than my lowest or fuck, probably 10 years of my life. If you're thinking about getting tattooed, ofc do your research and think long and hard but if you're sure, go for it (obligatory don't get tattooed underage warning, artists willing to do that aren't artists you should go for, wait til you're 18 or whatever the legal age in your country is)."

selfharm,fasirw9,t3_eahldl,1576327887.0,"I've always liked my legs. I'm a big guy and pretty tall but I have small legs for my height, they're the most tattooed parts of my body currently and (nearly) free of scars below the knee. I have always liked how small they are (length, they should be maybe 4 inches longer being my height and they're fairly toned). I really hope my left arm (most scarred part of my body, multiple scars that required surgery) is my favourite part of my body once I get that sleeve done, tattoos really make me feel like more of a person or more who I really am.

This idea is lovely, everyone needs more self love sometimes :) have a great day anyone who reads this."
