Sanderson is a beast and a writing machine and regularly updates when books are coming out.
Not every book is out but it's not like other authors, he keeps you up to date and a very fast writer.
Can understand where you're coming from but I'd reccomened sticking it out. Half the fun is reading theories with in the subs and sharing it with all these people.
Hope you're still enjoying it!"
audible,eqfyewj,t1_eqfdk0o,1560028882.0,"The assassin in white, Szeth, all you need to know about him so far is that he killed the King of Alothcar (excuse the spelling) using special kind of powers.
How Kaladin becomes a slave gets explained, you haven't missed anything, along with the special amor and swords.
Just tough it out for the first while everything is eventually explained fully even if it's just at the end of the 3rd book lol.

Try r/Stormlight_Archive for discussion and stuff

The book is part of a wider universe The Cosmere, so if you enjoy this series you should give them a look. Personally think Stormlight series is the best of the lot but there's a nice wee selection."
audible,epx8y60,t3_bwf39x,1559594851.0,"The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson, it's from 3 characters point of view but still very good not hard to follow. 1 of the main characters is a warrior, and another used to be with some flashbacks. Princeses and magic with a few battles inbetween."
MechanicalEngineering,epmkovy,t1_epm4yor,1559314301.0,This is what I got reccomened by my lecturers too. Can do most biomedical jobs with mechanical degree and you don't have to do any biology.
