schizophrenia,fnc64ra,t3_g0uk54,1586829433.0,I do. It's quite grounding for me to actually. At least enough to grab my bearings with reality.
schizophrenia,fiy17jd,t1_fixosot,1582830471.0,Thank you! I also appreciate a point in the right direction. :)
schizophrenia,fhtfvxw,t3_f4m9pa,1581874040.0,I needed this in my life. Thank you. XD
funny,ff20qr4,t3_er5bxs,1579490720.0,I can honestly see this as a gag gift I would get one of my girl friends as we never get functional front pockets anyways so why not ridiculously overcompensate with one giant back pocket? XD
mentalillness,fdiqozy,t3_eli1pl,1578448894.0,"I don't know if this'll help, but I want to at least try just in case it does. This is more from personal experience. I realize advice is never a one size fits all, but here goes. Just like the others here I, too, know that dark place. That dark place where it's so dark I forgot what I looked like inside and out. If I happen to glaze pass a mirror I did not recognize the reflection. It might sound cliche, but I think it's worth a shot. Find yourself. Rediscover who you are as a person. The good, the bad, all of it. What do you want out of certain situations? What can you do to make it happen, even if it is just small steps? I've heard people tell me that the small stuff doesn't matter, but tell that to my nickel and dimed bank account. What I'm trying to say is some of the small things that I don't feel like is a lot or a big deal, does become a big deal after a certain amount of time passes. Eventually, I can see and feel a difference. I'm still trying to find myself and honestly, I never want to stop. I hope for the same for you. To find yourself in a way so that you never want to stop discovering. If you would like resources, this website should provide assistance. Best of luck to you.

AskReddit,fc2vj7q,t3_eflpka,1577375175.0,I feel that this occured to me in childhood when I first noticed energy related problems that no one could relate to. Fast forward to my adult life and a plethora of progressively worse symptoms later and I was finally diagnosed with Hashimoto's at 29.
