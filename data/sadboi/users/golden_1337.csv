lexapro,fkynl5o,t3_flg4ti,1584652327.0,"I have same problems as you have. Tapered slowly from 20mg to 10mg in 3 months. My anxiety came back and i switched to 15mg. Maybe I am not good reference, because I am not seeing therapist."
lexapro,fktpt2r,t3_fkmvuk,1584530464.0,"I tapered from 20mg to 10mg, and most of symptoms came back. So 20 and 15 mg works better than 10mg for me. PS. Read my last post, where I asked similar question. Wish u all the best."
lexapro,fktoa13,t1_fks5zhu,1584528744.0,"Thats why I take 22.5mg. 15mg is too sedating, and 30mg do nothing for me. After 8-9 hours of sleep I dont have morning sedation. Yes, I gained a lot of weight. But I only can sleep with mirtazapine. It was life saver for me."
