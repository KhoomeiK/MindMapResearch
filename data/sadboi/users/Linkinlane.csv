I could deal with it because I never knew her in a  healthy place and watched her fighting for years and actually managing to get better. I think it's more difficult to see someone you know healthy falling sicker. Anyways I really wish you and your friend all the best. It's tough to be with someone so sick. Remember to also listen to your own needs.

My best friend self harmed for years in such a severe way that I really cannot believe she survived it. For ten years she would self harm on her stomach. She had severe anorexia, her bmi was under 10 at some point where the doctor at the mental health ward decided she should get a PET feeding tube. Unfortunately this got infected leading to an emergency surgery that left a big scar. Thats when the drama begins. She started to reopen the scar. Over and over again. She would cut down to her intestines and insert stuff into her colon. Nails, Screws, screwdriver.... She would just throw anything into her stomach. Money, dirt, deo... And there was a time where she wouldn't let it heal at all for two years, reopening the wound every day. So basically has an open hole down to her intestines for two years! Gets surgery over and over again. Suffered many many complications such as hernia, intestinal obstructions, fistula... On two occasions she had pushed a knife into her stomach and twisting it around. Set her leg on fire. Hammered nails through her Hand. And despite all that her body somehow managed to not only survive but also overcoming most of the worst consequences. She has been doing great, she hasn't self harmed for almost 2 years at all, her stomach is closed and the scar is healed. And whats absolutely remarkable: despite engaging in such unimagineable behavior she never lost her compassion, her sweet soul. She will only see the good in other people, be kind and lovely and she supports her friends with every ounce of her heart. I am so glad she survived this hell of illness to be around on this world today."

confession,f7lgv4c,t3_dwrtbo,1573840174.0,Could be me. I am a strange mixture of mistrusting everyone and not questioning anyone so I would probably act the same. Honestly being this naive has had some really unnice events happen to me already.
NonBinary,f7l86jk,t1_f7kfqjx,1573834812.0,"Yes! I suffer from severe PTSD and since it's misused as a meme I am even more troubled when trying to speak about it. I often feel like it's impossible for me to even mention that there are things that trigger me, because of the whole ""trigger= retarded snowflake sjw annoying what not"" situation. So it can become really unsafe for me, when I dissociate while being in public for example. People don't realize how much of an impact it has on people like me who are constantly shamed for being ""too sensitive""."
