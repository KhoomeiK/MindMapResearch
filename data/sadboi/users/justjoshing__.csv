AmateurRoomPorn,fbftd1z,t3_ed2nez,1576820341.0,"Your room looks so inviting and cozy! I’m currently moving and this is giving me serious bedroom goals. Also, we have the same end table. Thanks for the ideas, mate!"
bipolar,fbezwq2,t3_ed16hi,1576798007.0,"I don’t know how helpful or good this is, but sleep usually helps stop a manic episode for me. If I can feel something coming on, I’ll take a sleeping pill or two and go to sleep. It doesn’t work every time, but it helps."
bipolar,equ0qpe,t1_eqsxm88,1560322799.0,"If you can, try to cut down on social media. I started with deleting Facebook off my phone. That led to me deleting Messenger as well, and eventually deactivating my account. The only social media I still have is Instagram as it’s easier for me to not overshare on there since it’s mostly visual. Well, and this. 

I used to be the worst at oversharing on social media. Plenty of people read every emotion, success, and especially struggle that I dealt with. It was weird going without at first, but honestly I’m happier and less stressed. It’s also helped me learn to try and not overshare irl as well. I think not being able to access a source where I could share everything immediately has made a difference. Now I mostly process my thoughts, edit if necessary, and then share. 

Also, medication and therapy help a lot... so does staying away from heavy drinking and hard drugs. 

Ironically, I might have overshared in this response."
