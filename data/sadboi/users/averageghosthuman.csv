depression,fq92egt,t3_ghdi7l,1589183146.0,"When I have conversations with my parents about my depression they seem to think there’s a ‘fix’ I haven’t found yet, a way to be the normal people you speak of. 
But you can’t just go from hating every waking moment to true happiness. I feel like there’s a point where people are too far gone to ever experience any sort of ‘normal.’ I think I’m stuck like this for life"

depression,fpj117e,t1_fphvt06,1588653668.0,"Thanks for your advice! Unfortunately I have Idiopathic Hypersomnia (excessive fatigue) so my sleep schedule will always be one of my toughest battles. I’m going to try to work on it though; going to shoot for 10am. 

I agree that social media is so toxic. Though I’ve had ‘cleanses’ in the past, like for example this past summer I was a camp counselor and was basically in the woods the whole time, but I still managed to let envy get the best of me, whether that be from a friend telling a story about her close family or someone being a great leader. I feel like social media is harmful because it’s showing me what I’m missing out on/makes me more aware that there actually is a better way to live so while deleting it stops the constant reminders, the damage has already been done... if that makes any sense. 

Anyways, thanks for reading this gibberish if you do :)"

depression,fp142e4,t3_gajysh,1588223835.0,I feel like I have made some good friends in the past few years but I never have anyone checking in on me so idk how close we really are. I told them about my depression when we first met but because I’m always putting on an act it never really comes up. I always feel like I know so much about other people’s lives and they don’t know anything about mine. Not that there’s much to know. It’s like I’m living 2 lives- my depressed one and the one people see.

I don’t think my insurance will cover any of it. 
She’s not doing it but she referred me to someone because she said it would help her moving forward. 
I had my consultation with the psychologist conducting the tests and he made it seem like I could select certain assessments but when asking me what I wanted to learn from them I didn’t have an answer since I’m skeptical about the whole thing... so he decided we should do a full assessment. 
They both seem genuine so I want to trust that this could actually help but at the same time they probably just want $2400."

Can I ask if you feel a distinct comedown? At what point in the day do you take the IR adderall? I’m hoping I won’t have to do that because for me adderall + anxiety + bedtime = awake until 4 AM"
idiopathichypersomnia,feppwnl,t1_fep9c7c,1579327358.0,Yeah they also are having me start at 75mg. Do you have to wait a certain period of time before they up your dose? Hope that works out for you
depression,fecmgvu,t1_fec4z1r,1578977563.0,"Good to know that you didn't find it very helpful. I am also convinced that even if there is some sort of learning difference found (part of me thinks I could have ADHD), the real issue and cognitive decline would still be because of the anxiety, depression and sleep disorder. 

Interesting that your OCD 'status' also varies from psychologist to psychologist, who really knows right? I'm thinking of also getting off adderall because it doesn't really help with those issues and I think it heightens my anxiety. Have you found anything that works for you? 

Thanks for taking the time to read and respond."

The last person I saw thought I had OCD, this current person says they like to avoid labeling people with diagnoses as much as possible... 
but if you mean whether something else besides depression could be causing the cognitive blockage then I don’t think she knows and that’s what she wanted the test to determine."

I am also still exhausted after sometimes 12 hours of sleep, so much so that I ended up doing a sleep study last year where I was hooked up with a bunch of head electrodes and was told to take a 20 minute nap (or attempt to) every 2 hours. They found that I fell asleep in under 5 minutes each time, which led to them diagnosing me with ""idiopathic hypersomnia.""
