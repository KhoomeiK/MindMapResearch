mentalhealth,fpnm5b0,t1_fpl9pb8,1588767162.0,"Agreed, I thought her stuff with Shane Dawson about Jake Paul was irresponsible and I lost the respect that I had for her. It seemed like she was less genuine and more fame/attention seeking than I thought she was and I've never been able to look at her in the same way again."

I personally believe in the afterlife but in the case that there isn't any then there certainly wouldn't be anything like you describe IMO
