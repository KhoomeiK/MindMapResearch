Also lol at that last bit"
asktransgender,fr0wh47,t1_fr0qruj,1589808347.0,"That's not rubbing salt on the wound. I'm genuinely happy for you, and I wish you the best. I'm glad to know that finding a mental middle-ground is helping you. Being trans comes with a lot of self exploration attached, and not all find their way through it."
asktransgender,fj255hd,t3_faz2xw,1582934796.0,"I can't bear this.. This is exactly how my mother acts, she's not Chinese, but she's very traditional and I just can't stand how she makes everything in the world about her. Just move out and away, let her make sense of the situation, she'll try to contact you over and over again and she'll say hurtful things every time. But by the end of it, things will have changed to a point. In my case, all the hurtful things she said made me distance myself far away from her, and now she's the one trying to make things right. I don't know how things will work out for you, but I am almost certain that all the threats your mother made are just that, threats. Leave, carry on with your own life, and let her deal with her own problems while you deal with yours. Transitioning is hard, and it'll show you the true colors of those around you. I'm sorry that you had to deal with all of that."
Grammarly,faib4kk,t1_fai2r8f,1576103718.0,I appreciate the thought! I think that the paper turned out good though :)
asktransgender,f7xfevr,t3_dxxo3b,1574055512.0,That's amazing! I'm happy for you
mentalhealth,f6zwoce,t3_dtv7se,1573321757.0,"That sounds awful. I don't know every little detail in your life but I think that you deserve better than someone that would treat you like that.

I've been in similar situations in the past. I believe that if you step back and get some time away from your partner then you'll find out how you deserve much, much better."

mentalhealth,f6y7dx7,t3_dtmqje,1573269957.0,Have a happy birthday! if you ever need to talk to someone then I'm here. I'm more than happy to talk about anything.
asktransgender,f5fua5u,t1_f5f80bj,1572186787.0,"Hi u/newacco0101, thank you for your reply. As for your question, yes, I worked with an amazing doctor that thoroughly monitored my levels throughout my transition. The mental side of things is a bit complicated, but I'll try to explain. I come from a very conservative family, everyone I know is extremely conservative and religious, and would immediately shun and excommunicate me if they found out I was trans. I never presented, I just took HRT and tried to keep it under wraps. As you can imagine, that gave me a terrible feeling of constant fear and anxiety; I was always afraid of people finding out and ruining my life. I think that it's possible that all mental benefits I got were overshadowed by feelings of instability and anxiety, but who knows for sure."
