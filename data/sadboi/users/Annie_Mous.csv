I read a study and the majority of parents want to go back to the office, but non-parents would like to stay home. Parents require a definition of time and space. Others prefer flexibility and less structure. 

I hope in the ‘new world’ we don’t just go back to how it was. ESPECIALLY if there’s still no vaccine. Open concept hell is awful for everyone - and work from home policies can save the company money and space too. 

There’s just no need in the digital, virus-ridden world to haul ass to an office every day anymore IMO."

unpopularopinion,fofggkl,t1_foe5gue,1587735350.0,"My childhood best friend had a rare disease that took her when she was  27. It affected her physically, not cognitively. Her sister refused genetic testing and went on to have 4 children (luckily healthy). 

I asked her sister why she didn’t test herself as a carrier and she said it “wouldn’t make a difference.”

I’m torn on this issue on so many levels. My friend was the light in so many peoples lives; a constant reminder to seize the day. She was a beacon of strength and compassion. Literally everyone who knew her was better for it. But the pain of her loss was absolutely devastating for many, including myself.

Would I trade those memories for anything? No.
Would I willingly bring a kid into the world who was made to suffer like her, even though she enriched those around her?  I don’t know."
