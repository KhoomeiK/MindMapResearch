However, at the time it was in theaters, I actually started telling people I liked it because otherwise I would get such visceral reactions. Friends would jump on me trying to explain how great a movie it was and get irrationally angry at me about it. I've never experienced so many people getting so emotionally invested like that in a film before or since. 

I was so disappointed to not see the  Oscar go to Shawshank Redemption that year. One of my favorite movies of all time."

I'd start by keeping it short and just walking her around the house while you do chores and then helping her learn to relax and lie down. 

Also, in my case the indoor leash and outdoor leash are different, so my dog knows the difference between the 'chill' leash and the 'we're heading out' leash.

My now adopted former foster gets anxious over things like storms, loud cars and fireworks, so I still use an indoor leash to calm him down when he starts to show signs of stress. Instead of the excited dance for the walking leash, when I pull it out, he sticks his head right in (I use a slip lead  indoors to easily take on and off) and immediately lays down. It's become like a security blanket."
