bipolar2,fqete54,t3_gicz5r,1589313282.0,"This is so beautiful and relatable to me. I’m a woman who’s had long hair since I was in elementary school, long thick dark hair that I loved dearly. A few weeks ago I shaved my head, alone in my basement. And yes at first I was astounded by the permanence like oh god what have I done? I felt sick. But now I feel strangely liberated, I feel powerful and in control. Thanks for sharing this, I’m sure you rock your new cut!"
bipolar2,fpwxybm,t1_fpwx2zl,1588972008.0,damn I had no idea! But now that you say that I can see where you’re coming from. My therapist had told me about the help line and I thought I’d pass it along. I’ve been lucky enough to go straight to the ER when in crisis mode. Thanks for letting me know!
