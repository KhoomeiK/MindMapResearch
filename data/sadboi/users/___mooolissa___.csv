depression,f9f7e7r,t3_cml6ni,1575261571.0,I thought I had my life in my own hands. But just like that life has to throw me for a loop. My friend passed away from a car accident back home. My brother friend to commit suicide on thanksgiving- the anniversary after I made plans myself. My ex girlfriend called me late one night clearly distressed and I had to talk her down from spitting her wrists. And that’s basically my life. I have to stay strong for those around me when all I want to do is selfishly fall apart. I want to break down and cry and tell all of my sadness to those people around me but I’m so confused as to how the world is changing and what this means for my place it.
depression,f9f2f6l,t1_f6x7oba,1575257783.0,I cannot relate to this any more. I was very suicidal my senior year and the only place that I felt able to just exist and not think about that shitty side of my life was my teachers classroom. I’m so thankful for her and she has no idea.
