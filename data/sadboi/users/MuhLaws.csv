This is the premise of your entire argument and this premise is incorrect. 
Those gains are due to process automation. We need way, way less workers to produce the same things we did this time, 40 years ago, thus both productivity, efficiency and corporate profit has gone up. 

I work in an engineering/production environment, I live this every day. Productivity has increased because of the automation/technological mechanization of processes that were once manual and the *decrease* in the need for 'workers' who were once needed in factories but now, wait tables. 

This also speaks directly to the disaprity in wages that is occurring, since production once needed a lot more low-level labor whereas today, the most valuable people are much less common and in posession of skills that the people who used to 'man the machines' could not do (write effective G Code, engineer complex systems, etc) 

When you get into the argument of ""why is someone worth 100X more when they're not working 100X as hard"", the answer is because it takes 100 people before you find 1 who is cognitively able to do what they do, and there's been no complex or high-minded social engineering policies so far that shows any evidence of this not being true (ie, if we just teach prisoners to write Python, suddenly, they'll all become coders)"

The surplus of goods and production- which has a 1=1 translation into standard of living and thus, quality of life- thrown off by free market capitalism is what caused the Soviet Union to decide it was going about it all wrong, when Boris Yeltsin saw a supermarket in Clear Lake, Texas and didn't believe it wasn't a ploy by he CIA to create the illusion of some kind of prosperity that couldn't possibly exist.
