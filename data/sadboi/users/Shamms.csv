I was raised Catholic, but ""lost"" my religion in my teens. I know that people find solace and fortitude in their religion, and I think that's great. I just know there's no shelter there for me.

Honestly, this is me reaching out there. I talk to my friends about it, but I can't just keep going to the well. They're great friends, but everyone has the point where they're just dried up, so I try no to do it all of the time. I had the urge to post this on my Facebook account, but did it here instead. I'll confide in close friends or complete strangers, but I'm not calling out to acquaintances for public performance.

That's what made me try them. Things aren't perfect, but they're ok. I have a lot of heavy shit going on, but I'm maintaining.

We all know depression is insidious, it feels like it's a part of you, that it defines you. Sometimes I think that's why it's so hard to try to deal with it.

I hope you get to enjoy the good stuff."
