Well around January was when I finally discovered that my heavy ass breasts were giving me issues. The clue was when I got the idea to lift them. And what do you know I feel sooooo much better when I lift them but naturally temporary only cuz once I let them go is when hell breaks all lose again. I can’t even hold them for that long because they hurt my hands quickly and I get pins and needles in my hands quickly:( 

Oh but again the final icing on the cake was when I get my mom to lift up my breasts. Now this is very freedom because all these years I had no idea my breathing was bad. My posture corrects itself right away. My own body is correcting its posture because I feel my body moving in the correct posture. All fucking because I ask my mom to lift my breasts up so I don’t have anything to hold me back from having terrible posture. It horrifies me how terrible my posture is everyday because standing up straight is a big no no I just start to hurt quickly and I’m in bad posture everyday. 

Anytime my mom holds my breasts up is the true freedom I get. I cry because I can’t believe how fucking free I feel. Like it’s soooooooo gooooooodddd to feel free. My breathing get’s better and the pain slowly gets better. These things are so heavy that my mom has even pulled a muscle from them too😭😭😭😭 Than I cry of saddness when my mom let’s go cuz everything comes back to hurt me or make me feel sick:("

I hate these things so much:( Everyday they cause me pain in the neck, shoulder, back, and chest. I know I’m not wearing the right bra but any bra I try that’s not soft will hurt my shoulders immediately:( It hurts my chest because of all the pulling from so many years and the severe anxiety had weakened my body a lot:( It will hurt my chest too because again my body is weakened from the anxiety. Since they press on the same areas’s 24/7 it can and will probably make my anxiety worse because I’m in some type of pain everyday:( 

This is what causes me a lot to cry and get anxiety everyday from these things. I had no idea how much of an issue these things were until I tried to be more active and that’s a no go. Back just hurts immediately and hit’s my anxiety and ruins my day most of the times. I should of known from all these years of pain but it took me to get my severe anxiety last June to finally realize how much of a health issues these stupid heavy things actually are😭😭😭😭😭

This is why I’m so heart broken when my consultation was cancelled for April 7th. Now it means I have to keep waking up with these things and pray that it doesn’t ruin my day because again my body is very weak and having these awful things pressing on me and waking up everyday makes me cry:( I hate them soooo much. Every time I sleep, move while sleeping, and getting up they are always here to remind me that they will effect me one way or the other. Oh and yeah my breathing too😭😭😭😭 Since they keep pressing the same area’s you can imagine how my breathing is most of the day:( My back most of the days feel’s like it wants to snap. Them pressing together when I’m sleeping puts a lot of pressure in the middle of the chest. Even laying in my back hurts because of the heavy weight of them pressing my my front which means my back will hurt:( 

I’m so sorry I keep posting about my issues like this. But my god I just want this misery to end so I can get my life back and do normal things that other people can do with much smaller chest size. I just want to feel free like a bird and not feel this awful weight that’s on me every fucking day.

Hm I don’t think my breasts have that much fat or something because my breasts I don’t think have changed over the years. Not like one day I just hit up and noticed a huge kind of change. I’ve been losing weight back and forth and I still don’t notice any difference in the breast:( 

My goal for the surgery is to become an A or B cup. I don’t care how it will look on me. I’ve been in misery for one year almost and those many years ago. I just didn’t notice at the time those misery was from my breasts:( 

Yeah sadly in your situation I think surgery is the only option for you to get your life back as same with mine:( But hey that’s ok with me because when I hurt my back 5 years ago I was recommended back surgery which I refused to do so. So this will be my first surgery I’ll do for me:) 

Same here my sympathies to you too:) I think to myself why did god do this to me. But I’m like it’s ok because this is fixable. 

Do me a favor and stop Dr.Google right now. This is what changed my life last year. I convinced myself I had many different cancer’s and this is what made my anxiety worse. Stop right now because that worry can spiral down the rabbit whole even worse:(

The problem is with bra’s they hurt and furthers my issues. So bra’s just don’t help. Plus they dig in my shoulders and that makes it even worse. Reason is because my severe anxiety has weakened my body up or in this case the muscles. So having any thing in my chest feels like I’m fucking trapped and hurts and my anxiety makes my situation just worse. Basically my anxiety has taxed my body up really badly that I feel the awful weight of my breasts more than ever.  

Believe me I’ve tried exercising and it helps but it comes back to hit me in the ass as the weight on my chest is just too much:( It’s been like this for years but worse since my severe anxiety hit me almost last year

I only found this out from the severe anxiety I got and the many years of back, shoulder, and neck pain I have. I even hurt my back 5 years ago working.

Reduction,fm9l4g1,t1_fm8g59n,1585870966.0,Please do yourself a favor and get this surgery. It will change your life:) A lot of people are happy getting this surgery. I cannot wait until the day I get kind and I can breath better too:) Mine are heavy like you and trying to take a full breath is difficult when I have two fucking heavy breasts on my chest 24/7:(
bigboobproblems,fm6e96k,t3_fssqkf,1585792134.0,"I cry pretty much everyday. I have big breasts and they are really heavy. I hate hate hate hate hate them sooooooooooooooooooooooo much. My poor body cannot take the weight of them anymore:( They have caused me a lot of health, physical and emotional issues. My front of my chest hurts so much everyday pretty much because of how heavy the breasts are. My guess is they weight a total of 8 pounds each as just holding one of them my hand hurts and turns numb with pins and needles right away:( I cry thinking that I have that much weight tied to me everyday like weights and a backpack and I cannot take them off me:(

I want a reduction sooo badly but my consultation was cancelled because of the virus:( So to even get this surgery I and pretty much everyone else has to wait until things calm down:("

Reduction,fk9fivd,t1_fk9ei5c,1583975044.0,"Big oof😭😭😭😭 Honestly that wouldn’t surprise me if that’s the case as my breasts feel very heavy. I feel everyday I’m being crushed by the weight>_>

Oh god having close to 8 pounds on my chest makes me wanna cry sooooo much😭😭 This weight is just causing me so much health issues.

I don’t think I’m wearing the correct bra any ways. The issue is even if I did my whole muscles are very weak that even wearing a bra won’t help much much:(😭😭 I know what ever is going on with me won’t be helped without surgery:( I have to keep taking Advil to help me most days:( N

In the meantime I really should try to see if I can get a bra that is correct. I need to do as much as I can to help myself while waiting for insurance to even approve of this😭😭"
Reduction,fk8fdru,t1_fk8afng,1583955014.0,"Oh man that chart is very overwhelming for me to look at as there are a lot of numbers. 

But dear god if I understood this chart right I think my breasts really weight at least 4 pounds each as what I’m wearing is a 44DDD I think. So I think it’s not the right bra as the cups don’t fill up all the way. The closet I found to the current bra size chart you linked is UK 44DD that says they weigh 6.2 pounds but US is 3 pounds if I read this right? I know for a fact my breasts weigh more than 3 pounds as lifting on for a couple minutes hurts my hand a lot and causes me to have pins and needles:(

If my breasts really weight that much each tbh it wouldn’t surprise me if they did. But damn it it will shock me a lot if it turns out to be the case😱"
Reduction,fk8dklj,t1_fk8ab56,1583954066.0,"Since I’ve not weighed my breasts I have no idea their size:( But I know that they weigh more than 3 pounds I think. Holding my breasts up for even couple minutes hurts my hand a lot. My hand gets numb and pins and needles. But man it feels great to not be crushed by my breasts for those couple minutes   My mom even pulled a muscle since I ask her sometimes to hold my breasts up for me. That’s how heavy they are for my mom to pull a muscle because of me:(

For me I don’t give a damn about my breasts anymore. I am more than happy to tell any surgeon to remove basically everything if no close to it. 

Oh man I’m salivating with dreaming of having all that weight removed from survey. 

Gurl get ready cuz your life will change. Your body will thank you for getting this surgery and having all that weight removed from you❤️🥰😊"

Oh god the breathing😭😭😭😭 My breathing is bad with my big breasts which makes the anxiety worse for me. Trying to exercise to help my anxiety forget it:( Pain in the back next day.  Walking straight forget it cuz I feel pain very quickly and it’s back to slouching:(


I will feel pain because of the weight:( My life is basically ruled by my big breasts causing me health issues everyday
:( I think my big breasts weigh about 4 pounds each😭 If they really weigh 4 pounds each for me it’s no wonder I’m getting health issues everyday. Having 8 pounds of weight in my chest is terrible and awful:( 

I feel you man as trying to do even normal simple things is impossible with big greats in the way. 

I just hope that my insurance covers this because I know this surgery will greatly help me soooooo much:)"
Reduction,fk89hep,t1_fk8892q,1583951876.0,"Same here. It’s been so long since I’ve had small breasts. I too don’t remember what it feels like to be small or even walk straight for that matter:( I suffered really bad health anxiety in June. Since than my body has become very weak. This here is when I found out how much of a medical issue my big breasts have caused me. It took me until January to finally pick up my breasts have been adding to the pain and anxiety because of the pain. If I discovered this sooner I wouldn’t have wait this long to want my surgery:( My anxiety has weakened my body and muscles a lot. This causes me to feel very sick and in pain that my breasts cause me. It’s basically the equivalent of tying 4 pounds and another 4 of weight on my chest but we cannot simply remove them without surgery. They have nowhere to go so those same area’s always hit me everyday and that pain causes my anxiety to come half the times and half of my day is ruined from this:( 

Forget trying to exercise to help my anxiety when my big breasts are there and cause me pain:(

I wish I can wake up tomorrow without these big breasts because my chest area desperately needs this surgery and relief so so so so badly😭😭😭😭 Also my back, neck, and shoulders to as they are in pain everyday pretty much:("

My Dream is to go even smaller than yours as I don’t care about having my breasts anymore. They have caused a lot of pain and health, physical, and mental problems. I just want them gone as much as I can because I want my life back. I’ve come to the point that my body and chest just cannot support my heavy breasts anymore. For my breasts I’m gonna guess they must weigh about 4 pounds each?! I don’t know because I’ve never got them weighed before. All I know is that they are very heavy and to have two heavy things in anyone’s chest is awful:(
If you don’t mind me asking what size were you and what size are you currently?!! I can tell you look so happy:) I bet all of the pain is almost gone:) I bet you can sleep better without feeling like your suffocating from the breasts. Most importantly I bet you can stand up straight and posture is improving slowly:)

For me I’m crying almost everyday because my breasts cause me medical issues that bad and I know I desperately need this surgery. Even wearing bras doesn’t help:( But going with insurance the wait is just killing me:( Trying my best to be patient and see if insurance will cover my reduction surgery.
