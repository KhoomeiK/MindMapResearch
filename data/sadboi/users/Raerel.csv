asktransgender,etwzwyn,t1_etwsfk0,1563288279.0,You need to do that by yourself then...u know how your mind and soul work better than any of us...you alone need to find a way to think more positive..no one can help you do that really...and i know how this sounds...it's really scary but at the same time...u realize that you're in control.
asktransgender,etwqa82,t3_cduqng,1563280958.0,"I was working at the pool...and one day this one girl came...she was beautiful and stunning..but she had hugee shoulders...very wide i mean...bigger than mine or yours...but it really didin't matter honestly...she was so feminine and elegant...that no matter what ""masculine"" traits she had...they were just contributing to her femininity.
U asked here so people can help you cope...but no matter what people throw at you..u just say that it's not helping and that u have the biggest shoulders in the world....it's almost like you want people to say that you will never pass with that shoulders and never be happy. People here had really great points to make and you ignored them all. You'll never be able to cope if you're not allowing yourself to.
So really...the problem is in you...not your shoulders or anything else on your body."
