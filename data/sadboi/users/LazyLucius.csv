depression,fai7243,t3_e96vk9,1576101192.0,Just the thought of getting out of bed can make you nauseous. I really hate that feeling. It gets better over time as long as you open up to the right people.

NoFap,f9kb2uo,t3_e5gn0t,1575396707.0,"Very sorry for your loss my friend. It‚Äôs painful to lose a family member, especially one that you are close to. However, be happy that you got to spend time with him even though it might not have felt that way. At least he is in a better place watching over your shoulder. Keep your promise and make him proud. Every time you feel like you‚Äôre going to fall, come back here and let us give you inspiration!"

Till this day, even I‚Äôm still not recovered from it, but it will get better over time whether you‚Äôd be a male or female. It all depends on how much time you spent on porn. In my case, a lot of time lol. Good luck on your journey! I believe in you all!"
NoFap,f9k082a,t3_e5f5lc,1575389918.0,"Can‚Äôt emphasize how many times flashbacks would go through my head at random places. I sometimes would even get a boner if it goes on for too long.

NoFap,f9hltt1,t1_f9hkrmr,1575317324.0,It‚Äôs completely fine that you saw a ‚Äúsexy pic‚Äù as long as it wasn‚Äôt intentional. I used to have this mindset and figured that this wasn‚Äôt my fault so I didnt consider it a relapse. Keep fighting my friend!

NoFap,f9gweb9,t1_f9gw66e,1575305703.0,Yeah man! Gotta focus on being productive and improving your life!
NoFap,f9gvm37,t1_f9gv82d,1575305379.0,A bit of both tbh. It depends on the scenario. If I look at something that I know for sure will give me pornographic thoughts then I would look away and do something else
NoFap,f9guxp0,t1_f9gq0yr,1575305102.0,"I get what you‚Äôre saying but in social media situations where you have the option of scrolling down or stare at the sexy picture, i would keep scrolling. However, if I see something ‚Äúsexy‚Äù while playing a game or i‚Äôm talking to a pretty girl, then it can‚Äôt be avoided. I‚Äô m prepared to converse with pretty girls or facing sexy pictures out of the blue. However, if I have the option of focusing my time on something more important, I would look away. nofap is all about normalizing woman and not looking at them in a ‚Äúpornographic‚Äù view."
NoFap,f9gnalz,t1_f9gmb6m,1575301933.0,"It‚Äôs completely ok to look at sexy pictures. It‚Äôs an indication that you like what your see. However, it‚Äôs not ok to stare at it and start fantasizing and soon maybe even start edging and relapse."
