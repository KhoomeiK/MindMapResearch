Treeparents,ff1znnu,t1_ff13unp,1579489935.0,Thank you. May your existence be as equally sad.

Rosie doesn’t talk much about the experience, only the technique and the effects. I think the David Lynch interview with Paul McCartney is pretty good in regard to experience. When in doubt do your checking for sure, it’s free for life!"

transcendental,feywtjn,t1_fevlv17,1579451504.0,I’d say Rosie knows how to do it but not to teach it. She’s doing a shorthand version and calling it a lesson which is incorrect. People often have different understandings of what’s taught (any subject) and checking is good. I’m just saying from my observation that not doing it seems to be the main reason people forget.
