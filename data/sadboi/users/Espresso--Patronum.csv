Today's ""routine"":

1. Washed with AAC No-Lather Cleanser
2. AAC Daily Conditioner (let sit while I do the rest of the shower things), then de-tangle with a wide tooth comb before rinsing.
3. Rinse with the coldest water I can stand. I just rinse the regular way, I haven't found S2C to be helpful for me.
4. Raked through a bit of the AAC Bouncy Cream.
5. Plopped in a microfiber turbie twist thing for like 30 minutes while I drank my coffee.
6. Shook my hair at the roots and let air dry.

Normally after the cream, sometimes I'll distribute more evenly with a Denman brush, then add some of the AAC gel, then plop. After that I usually add a bit of the Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus form mousse product, then diffuse. So on a typical wash day I get more volume and definition, but I was super surprised to see how far my hair has come with almost no product or effort!

A year ago, it would have air dried almost completely straight.

My hair was full ringlets before I started straightening it in high school, but it's been more than 10 years since that, so just what I have now is so exciting for me!"

My doctor filled the forms out for me, so my therapy and psychiatry appointments are covered, as well as any mental health days and the fact that I am constantly late for work because I just cannot get out of bed. I still have to use my sick time, but I can't be penalized for it unless I run out of my 12 weeks of coverage.

I'm also very upfront and open with my supervisor about what's going on, which I know isn't an option for everyone. But getting the courage to talk to her about it very frankly has made a big difference and she has been very understanding."
