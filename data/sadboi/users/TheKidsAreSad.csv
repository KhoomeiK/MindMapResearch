Suddenly, you can see through them. You cannot move, you cannot hear, you cannot think. Your body is placed in a casket, and the casket is closed. It's now darker than it was. You're laying in your coffin, stationary and are getting a horribly ominous feeling that seems to stand right behind you, though you're not even standing.

Suddenly, you can hear. You can hear the dirt being shoveled back up, and hitting the roof of your casket, sealing you into the ground. Then a newer sound completely covers up this one. It's the sound of millions of screaming voices all coming from within the ground next to you. Except... their mouths aren't open. They're dead. Their vocal cords do not work anymore. You realize it's their souls that are screaming. They-- along with you-- have been grounded to the earth after death, and there's nothing any of you can do. You feel helpless. A wave of unfathomable despair and fear washes over you like a wave in the ocean. You can hear family crying, leaving, and then nothing except those wretched screams.

You can wait. You can wait. You can wait. You can wait. You can wait. Then, after years of waiting, you can feel. You can feel as you decompose. It feels like you're burning-- no-- melting into a form you've never experienced. You can feel as the insects infiltrate your tomb, and begin to slowly eat at your decomposing flesh. Worms will slide in and out of your ears, your head, and feed at your blue brain. You can feel your thoughts and feelings and memories and nerves all being stolen away with this slimy pinching sensation in you. The other insects all crawl up and down your body, open up your mouth via your flimsy and now liquified jaw and crawl in and out of your mouth. You can feel your gag reflex, but no gag. You feel them in your eyes, rolling your eyeballs around like wheels.

This does not end until there's nothing left of you but bone and hair. Even then, you're still lying there in excruciating pain from your decomposition, which you will continue to feel for the rest of your ~~life~~ death.

I'm sure you've heard those words 1000 times or maybe even more, but doing that is not going to help with anything. I promise you. The only thing suicide brings is pain and grief, and you miss out on all the things you'll wish you'd done.

Please.

You've made it this far. I know you can keep going."
