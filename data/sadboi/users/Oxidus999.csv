Of course, there are movies like the King or the Outlaw king, but they aren't even as half as engaging as the Kingdom of Heaven. It also has some good cast like Orlando Bloom or Eva Green. The only other movie that can compare with it from back then is the Last Samurai. It's sad that Hollywood doesn't make another big budget medieval movie, instead we get capeshit movies twice a year. Another reason why it is so well praised is maybe because it is the only big budget movie about crusaders in Jerusalem."
