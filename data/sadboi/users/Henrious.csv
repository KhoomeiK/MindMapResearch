But the real reason you are here is to read this message. You are an awesome and valued person. More people like you than you realize. You are your own worst critic. The little details you think are wrong with you are not even noticed by others. 

Life is fleeting and in a way, futile. Even presidents and kings are mostly forgotten after enough time.

Try and enjoy the little moments, and help others enjoy moments too. It's all we have. Your problems dont matter. Just like all the huge problems of your ancestors that you dont even remember. It will all be okay in the end. Take care"

This isnt and doesnt have to be permanent. People freak out. You're human. It can be a hard step especially since it seems you have anxiety problems, but you can unblock them and talk to them. You had a moment. If you value their friendship, let them know. 

And for longer term, seek professional help. Humans have a lot of issues, and every single person you meet is a complex mess of problems and worries. Sometimes things really are just a chemical imbalance or something. A professional can help guide you. 

Wish the very best for you and dont give up. Mistakes and melt downs happen. You'll grow from them and be a little stronger for it."
