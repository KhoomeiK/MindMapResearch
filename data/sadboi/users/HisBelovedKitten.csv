That's why you get a sahm or new mom forum app like baby bump. Cause if you have babies, she probably more worried about a weird looking bump in your kids mouth that could be a tooth, than hooking up with some guy. Mom are natural worriers about babes. Men are the last thing we think of. Women are so different. We dont live the porn life like so many guys.

FAR from the truth. He satisfies me just fine. And he's gone for months at a time for work. I personally have no desire to have another man in my life at all. I get enough physical (obviously not sexual) touch from the children. And I have toys, so.....we enjoy a little cam action. 
And no, I don't fantasize about other men. I really do NOT understand married women that do. I married my husband because he's my best friend and fulfills every desire I have. Periodt. He's my everything. Why be married if you're just gonna do him dirty? I dont get it. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
