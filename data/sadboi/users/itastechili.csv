AmItheAsshole,fr6h0je,t3_gmrbbk,1589926092.0,"This is going to be buried but

I (26f) shaved my head almost a year ago and I love it. I've never had long hair, I've always found it annoying. It's rarely even past my shoulders. 

But it's shocking how family vs public reacts. My family knew I wanted to do it for years but lost their minds. ""you're going to regret it"" being #1. Guess what, if I do in a decade what of it. I'll cringe at myself but be proud and happy that I did something so bold that I've always wanted to do. It's just hair. But they've come around now

Everyone else loves it. I get compliments every time I (used to) go out. A few people ask me if I'm sick but that's just rude in general to do. 

My only issue has been dating, men always ask when I'm going to grow it back out. But I doubt you'll have that issue with your daughter 

My 5 year old now asks to have her head shaved every time I trim mine. We homeschool so I'm not too concerned about that side of it but I always tell her when she's 9 or 10 she can if she wants to. 

It's just hair, it's liberating to be free of it in so many ways, and I'm proud of you for letting your daughter do this."

Needlefelting,fpdvp16,t3_gbzdun,1588535176.0,"I got a 3 self storage cart.  I got [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NQJNV4F/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_ERXREb52FAXHP) but their are some pretty [fancy ones too](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0796SMSPS/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_kTXREbYJ3T1EE). I felt in my chair, in my bed, at my desk, everywhere. Which is why most things didn't work for me. I like that my little craft cart can go about with me easily.

I then put my wool in jars. Mason jars work great. But I like that corked apothecary look. So I used some classic jars and some mason jars with cork lids.

Previous I used a [tackle box](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0GUA6U/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_.VXREb1V2ZXNP) and it worked great. I live in a tiny space and had little room to put it anywhere except tucked away on the floor, which wasn't fun constantly bending down for. But if you don't mind that or can put it elsewhere besides low down, it's a great storage unit. The only thing is you need to roll and twist the yarn to get them to fit. Any ""jewelry"" organizer that's like the inserts in the tackle box work if you don't want the big thing. They just have to have adjustable compartment. Which worked really well for needles and such as well

I also used at one point a [door organizer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D58DRVC/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_80XREb134Q3ER). Again, it worked great. It just wasn't ideal for me so I switched to the cart.

Other ideas I have had was [peg boards](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008M7RUO2/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_e5XREbC9V1N3F) and add  [cups](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NPVSYZY/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_g8XREb50AAH02) for needles/scissors and [large cups with lids](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KMKDFKN/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_o7XREb2KN9X1H) for the wool.

Long story but my parents took me in after I left baby daddy. My dad recently passed and now my mom is a single mom and financially struggling. SHE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE ME PAY ""RENT"".

I do what I can financially. We take turns buying groceries. I clean the house completely by myself so I'm earning my keep a bit. Cook dinner, do the errands, whatever I can do because I can't do much as far as money. 

She wouldn't ever think about doing what OPs parents are and neither would I. My mom is now applying for promotions at work and looking at cheaper smaller houses to move into. She's selling the camper. She bought me a computer so I can start school!! She'd do anything for me to help me be successful. LIKE PARENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO (to an extent).

As a parent you have only 2 jobs. Keep them alive and try to help them become a mostly functional adult. 

You can't expect a kid in their 20s with a simple job to pay for 60% of a household for 5 people and have the means to break out of the poverty cycle. That's some shitty shit. OP shouldn't worry.

There is a long line of similar mental health issues in my family but mines the 2nd most severe and the one that started extremely young. My first suicide attempt was when I was 7.

My dad and ex of 6 years where also pretty abusive and after I left the ex my brain when to shit. And I had to move back in with my parents which wasn't too much better. I totally blame them with a bitterness. 

But a few years ago I was violently raped by 2 men I knew for over a decade. I haven't been even remotely ok since. I'm now disabled, afraid of talking to men more then once, and generally can't live my own life. I would have some sort of power and enjoyment out of my life and have almost 0 now because of what they did.

I hate and blame them with tenacious rage. I don't even call them by name, the leader of the incident being called he who shall not be named for a bit of humor to have some power. 

I hate and blame them so much that when he who shall not be named favorite football team went to the Superbowl and lost I felt so great about it.

Excluding my ex who said I'd been taking about to him when we met 9 years prior and defended me. I still have my shaved head under a year later and love it so heckin much. Yet my loved ones STILL think it has something to do with my mental health and that I'll come around regretting it. 

With work, I work at haunted houses and the like. I'm extremely open about it because it's an environment where I have the luxury of doing so. No one makes any comments until something happens. Which goes back to, oh there goes itastechili, being bipolar again. Whether or not it was actually the bipolar. 

For the most part it's not in my day to day life with people but it's always in the back of people's minds that I'm different and it pops up now and then with how they treat me.

Honestly I don't know if people are right when they blame my bipolar or not until after a good while. It kinda sucks that it's a toss up if I'm being stigmatized and they are actually right.

Just to stroll back over to let you out of the cage and fix the disaster they caused. 

They also like to take a little walk and do weird pranks elsewhere in the brain. Sometimes go and shred things we need to remember, trick a nerve to think it's in pain, etc

Imagine one of those annoying YouTube prank channels by 2 or 3 16-22 year old boys. They take everything too far and have absolutely no regards to others or cause and effect. One of them fuckers is bopping around brain headquarters being a complete and utter twat to the point it gets dangerous."

I was prescribed xanex on a trip to a neighboring full legal state because TRIGGERS. My dad had just died of an overdose, partially to do with benzos. So my family and I arent a fan when I need a prescription for one. 

Anywho I decided to try tincitures as a replacement. For the record I hate smoking it. I get lethargic and exhausted. But it's better then benzos!

It worked amazing to curb my anxiety and I felt like I had more energy. So I took a few bottles home and applied for a medical card. 

I didn't touch them at first because I was going to use the as needed for anxiety. But I had to go off an antipsychotic. That's always so fun. I ""microdosed"" through it. The world was actually not a living hell through it. I had some energy and wasn't losing my shit. So I just kept taking 2mg every 2-4 hours even after. 

I ran out while waiting for medical and bought some super cheap stuff to smoke. I only smoked the tiniest amount and it took me over a week to clear a small bowl. It didn't make me terribly depressed but it dampened my mood. 

I just got my card and tincitures again and boom, half stable and have a bit more energy! I still need my current meds, to replace my old ones, and therapy. It's not a cure-all. But it's a solid crutch. Smoking it is just, meh though.

writing in a journal and mood diary/app, making my bed
talking to or texting someone everyday
physical self care like getting dressed in something I love or taking extra time in the shower
participating in a hobby
setting aside $50 every paycheck to blow on whatever the fuck I want to
having a checklist on a whiteboard of daily task eg. meds, brush teeth, etc
writing down 3 productive things to do each day (I put that space on the bottom of my whiteboard)
meditation. I joined a guided meditation group to get started. Super recommend
yoga
mindfulness
vitamins
4 square breathing when I’m anxious or angry
Making sure my environment is not a wreck and decorated. People don’t give enough credit to a personalized decorated space for your mental health
Weight based workouts. Screw cardio. A gym helps so much with that. The workout atmosphere is great
Going on random cheap spur the moment adventures. Library, museum, you name it. 
Having something easy to take care of. Plant, fish, shrimp, rodent, etc. I had rats and it was awesome.
And honestly, a bit of spirituality if that’s you’re thing. I’m agnostic and not even close to a bible thumper but touching base with my spirituality often is peaceful.

You’re talking about a young woman that lost her mom and learned that woman wasn’t her biological mother. So she maturely decided to meet the woman who gave birth to her, who is 50% of her. She has the right to know who you are now. 

You don’t want to selfishly because that’s a dark part of your past and you want to ignore it. You are taking absolutely no consideration of YOUR DAUGHTER. You gave her up and moved on but she is still your kid. Give her enough respect to let her know who you are and why you left her with her dad and “step“ mom. 

Just fly out there and let her meet you for one day. Don’t tell your other kids the details, make an excuse. But god damn. You basically abandoned your child. Give her the courtesy of just meeting you one time. 

And I’m not someone who has no idea what I’m talking about. I’m a single mom with a absolutely garbage of a baby daddy that doesn’t want our daughter and who’s about to go to prison for years. I’d love to find a new man and pretend her bio dad doesn’t exist. But that’s not ok. Her dad is a part of her no matter what.

She’s going to think about whatever you do for the rest of her life. This is a huge deal. Don’t be a dick."

I remember thinking to myself, “ I have to say yes. I can’t make a scene in front of everyone that’s important to him” It was mortifying.

I think it’s just an culture in men that tends to be in impoverished communities. Sadly African Americans are still recovering from the extreme racism that’s occurred in the last 100 years. Many are still alive today that didn’t even get a proper education because of segregation. It’s extremely hard for a community of people to recover from that. 

I lived near the low income area in my very predominately white town. It was just as bad as you describe. Gang mentality. Respect and honer is above basic civility. Men being pigs. Men blaming everyone else especially other races for anything that happens. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard a white guy blame shit at work on a bad coworker messing up that can’t be fired because they are black/Hispanic. Even though it was clearly their fault. 

I have no idea what the correlation is between poverty and men acting shitty. Lack of proper education? Revolving cycle of the behavior? No idea.

 Let’s hypothesize that this is an African American family. 

Slavery didn’t end all that long ago. Slaves where not taught how to read. These descendants began trying to educate their children. White people said hell no. So uneducated/barely educated people where trying to teach. So few of them tried out of terror. Later so few sent their child to pubic school out of terror. 

This was within the last 100 years.

So Suzie didn’t go to school because she could have been raped and beaten to death for trying. She figured out how to survive by doing a low income job. Suzie married Joe who grew up the same. Get married. Have a baby named Harry. 

They aren’t being payed hardly anything. Because education restrictions and racist pay scales. 

Baby Harry grows up in a household that fully believes education doesn’t matter. It’s a waste of time when you could be providing. It’s too expensive. Many reasons. That’s how Suzie and Joe grew up so it was “normal” to teach to Harry. Harry helps his mom and dad at work from a very young age. Grows up the same as they did. 

Harry grows up to be a 20 year old that can’t read.

This happens all the time. Reading being the extreme but kids dropping out after elementary school to help keep themselves fed is so freakin common it’s sad.
