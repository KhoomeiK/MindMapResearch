AnxietyDepression,fnnob5x,t1_fnksdhz,1587097207.0,I definitely want to start going to counseling again once I can. Thank you
AnxietyDepression,fnno859,t1_fnknwnv,1587097147.0,I want to get back into counseling but I was in the process of moving and finding a new one when the lockdown hit so it's impossible right now. I'm just dwelling so deep in my shame. My depression has always been terrible but now with the added shame...

depression,fluakye,t1_flua7zd,1585498750.0,"How boring would the world be if everyone was the same? It's okay to not like to go outside. It's okay to be quiet. We need the introverts as much as we need the extroverts. The listeners as much as we need the talkers. Live your life the way that makes you happy 

Telling someone to kill themselves is never acceptable. Your sister should be absolutely ashamed of herself because that behavior is inexcusable and I wish I could give her a piece of my mind and you a hug. You have support.

Your life is just as valuable as anyone else's even if you live it differently"

AnxietyDepression,fkntll8,t1_fknogqp,1584373648.0,"I definitely agree with that. Recognizing that you're completing things, even things that seem easy normally, is important"
AnxietyDepression,fknjcgl,t3_fjktpb,1584367170.0,"It's easy for someone observing from the outside to say just get up! But it's not as easy as that. I've been there. Focus on the small victories - it was a success if I showered recently. It's good to have people that encourage you to push yourself but that understand how hard you're working when it feels like there is a magnetic force pulling you to the bed. It's hard to explain to people that haven't felt it.

For me medication helped so I am functioning for the most part. Therapy helped me too because it's someone who is on your side. Although I had to go through a bunch to find one I liked. 

You're not alone and I'm proud of you for mustering up the energy to write this post!"

depression,finj7f2,t1_finio40,1582564318.0,I've been severely depressed my whole life. It doesn't matter what's going on or how good things seemingly are. It's always there. And I've been having a really hard time fighting it back lately. I find myself thinking about it more and more and there's really no one I can talk to about it because they don't get it. I feel like I'm choking

AnxietyDepression,fi4ywej,t1_fi4lohy,1582151272.0,I didn't even realize I was getting panic attacks at first because I never realized they manifested in different ways
AnxietyDepression,fi4yss1,t1_fi4pdke,1582151212.0,Same. I get continuously angrier the more noise I hear until I feel like I'm going to explode
AnxietyDepression,fi4ylh2,t1_fi4usma,1582151092.0,It sucks when I feel like everything is great and suddenly boom! Noise intensifies and anxiety strikes
AnxietyDepression,fi42fr1,t1_fi41zgl,1582132611.0,That's true. Certain songs do help me out. Usually instrumentals with easy beats

AnxietyDepression,fi42204,t1_fi2iw48,1582132393.0,I try to just huddle up into a small ball and block out the light and noise. It's better if I'm in a place I can control but usually I'm confined in a car when it happens. Feels like a current is running through my body
AnxietyDepression,fi41v88,t1_fi316r8,1582132284.0,I need to get some

AnxietyDepression,fi2a01e,t1_fi25rm4,1582074932.0,This is what happened to me. It was sudden and higher pitched voices got to me the most and I tried to block out light. Is there anything in particular you do when this happens?

AnxietyDepression,fi29hug,t1_fi20r9j,1582074587.0,Thank you. I tried focusing on my breathing but I was in a car with other people and just hearing the coins clinking or breathing was setting me off. When we got back I went on a walk and there are a few songs that help me a bit

depression,f2uly17,t3_de6gcx,1570420226.0,"I struggle with binge eating too. My weight didn't fluctuate too dramatically because I went back and forth between that and not eating enough so my first therapist said it wasn't a problem. I eat foods that make me feel sick and the new psychologist said I probably did that to myself so I physically felt as shitty as I do mentally. She was probably on to something but I still can't figure out how to make it stop. However, having a small group of people I tell helps me stay accountable to my actions"
