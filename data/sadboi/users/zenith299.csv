They each have their own flaws and scars from childhood which is disguised by the facade they put out. 

I thought Forty would turn out to be the villain but I didn't watch the trailer for this show, so everything was a surprise.

I was hoping that Delilah and Candace wouldn't die so easily since they were built to be such strong characters. It would've been more interesting to see Henderson's plot evolve into something bigger since it was an important piece to the story-line. 

I'm looking forward to seeing the cop bring down Joe for the crimes he committed. He probably isn't as naive as he seems, and maybe he'll work with Ellie to discover what happened to her sister.
