AskMen,fmliq32,t3_fvct6j,1586187211.0,"I was and still kinda am in this situation. Basically I started hooking up with this guy in the fall then caught some feelings. He started saying things that made me think that maybe he also had feelings so I told him. He hit me with the “it’s not the right time”. I tried to reestablish the FWB because I thought if I kept trying then the “right” time would come around. We had a falling out which was pretty awful. Then after spring break I texted him and we hooked up again. The second time around I didn’t really feel the same way. I came to the realization that there’s no way we could ever date. It didn’t stop me from having feelings again but it made things easier. 

To answer the question though, it hurts a lot and makes me question if I even deserve to be loved. Like what about me makes me undatable but good enough to fuck? I know in my situation that it’s because we’re in different stages of our lives. Although it still makes me feel a little less valuable."

While the attic is neat the thing that always fascinated me was the attic/storage space on the second floor. It looked like a regular closet in one of the rooms but it was pretty huge. My grandma is a bit of a hoarder so it was pretty full of stuff. I didn’t find out until they were renovating that the stairs in the kitchen that we were too full of junk to use actually led to this huge storage space. I was told it was so that the servants, maids, cooks or whoever could start breakfast with waking anyone up by using the main stairs.

I currently use the biore charcoal face wash every time I shower (everyday or every other day), Burt’s Bees grapefruit facial cleansing towelettes (almost every day), and occasionally a Yes To face mask. A lot of my actual acne comes from stress and eating habits so I don’t think there’s anything product wise I can use there, but I’m still down for suggestions on that too.

Either way I think in a sense maybe Brendon is tired of playing I write sins. He may not hate it but I doubt he gets super pumped to play the song.

Fathers on the other hand get the bad rep of only being able to be present and active in a child’s life which is seen as easier or not as important in some cases. I think what I’m trying to really say is just because you carried a child for 9 months and birthed them it doesn’t make you a good mom. Also just because you take care of them it also doesn’t make you a good mother or parent for the fact, you have to love and cherish them too."

My end goal is to be fluent in a language by the time I graduate and that just doesn’t seem possible with Russian.

AskMen,ew6vfst,t1_ew6bs63,1565181493.0,I’m really passionate about father’s rights and I really just want to educate people about how unfair the laws can be. It’s way more unfair for unmarried men. Also we don’t know the whole system yet. Maybe the law is strict but the enforcement of it is more relaxed. I don’t really see that being the case but I know judges in the area which I live are just glad to see the father want to be a part of their child’s life. Also thank you for the reasonable response.
AskMen,ew69y92,t1_ew67jcl,1565159584.0,"Maybe my wording is a little misleading but in the state of Ohio when a child is born to an unmarried couple the mother has sole custody of the child. Pretty much all hospitals will provide an affidavit of paternity but even if both parties sign that document it doesn’t give the father any direct rights. He still has to file custody through the court. Yes having the affidavit makes it possible to file for custody and go through the whole process but until that moment the mother is in full custody of the child. That leaves the father at risk for being reported as kidnapping and gives the mother the right to withhold the father from seeing the child. So in reality my brother who has not yet gone through the court has no rights to his child.

The house was still filled with quite a few possessions such as clothes. There were some rooms that were inaccessible due to the fact that the floor was giving out. It seemed to be a beautiful home and I’m not exactly what happened that caused it be abandoned and then turn into the decay it was in its final days. I have heard rumors that it could have possibly have been fire although there seems to be no evidence and no news report.

AbandonedPorn,evu0g6s,t1_evtnzfq,1564782625.0,There were some clothing items and newspapers. Specifically we found some baby clothing. And if it’s not obvious in the picture the house was pretty far along in decay.

russian,ev8whod,t1_ev8p7kh,1564294403.0,Yes it is for class. Last year I dowloaded the text and copied like the first 50 pages of the activities manual from a friend but then I got lazy and started to ask for photos but sometimes they would send them to me way later and I wouldn't get my HW done. lol. but yeah splitting the cost is a good idea. It's only like $80 on amazon to rent the both of them though so I might just break down and rent them.

russian,ev8lf7q,t1_ev8lb8g,1564283159.0,I haven’t found it but you can rent both the text and activities manual for $70-$80 on amazon. It’s still expensive and not ideal but if you have the money it’s a good source. I will definitely let you know if I find it.

AskReddit,eth35h9,t1_etfncdd,1562804793.0,"Came here to say that, this is the one movie I remember watching as a really young child and enjoying and I still enjoy it today. Often times when I go back and watch movies from my childhood they just aren’t the same but Stand By Me never changed. I still get all the same feelings every single time I watch it."
AskReddit,est2s4r,t1_ess4htz,1562261371.0,"This reminds me of my own story that I don’t consider attempted murder but anyways. My dad has PTSD and a lot of other mental disorders from his childhood and being in the navy. One night he just went off the deep end. He smashed both mine and my mom’s phones and threw my mom down the basement stairs. I had retreated to my room instead of running and the next thing I know he was in my room with a gun yelling at me and trying to punch me, thank god for my dog that laid on top of me and took all the punches. He then left and the police came but my mom refused to press charges. He eventually came back and my dumbass mom let him into the house so I grabbed the landline and ran out the back door. As I was on the phone my mom came to find me and tell me not to call the cops but it was too late. He wasn’t charged with anything but they took him to a mental hospital where he got the treatment he needed. He still has out bursts and they scare the fuck out of me. I get nervous even if he’s just stupid drunk and doing nothing. he doesn’t understand why I wont talk to him why he’s drunk. He also doesn’t know that I called the cops."

AskReddit,eottbmp,t1_eos1qbo,1558848214.0,Thank you for this sm. And the whole thread. I always felt like I was doing something wrong because I’ve tried all the tips to prevent razor bumps and ingrown hairs. I’m glad to see that it might not be what I’m doing but just how my body reacts to shaving down there.
