However, we do statistically have more advantages than other minority groups in areas of income, or education, etc. We are used as a wedge in ways that do hurt other minorities.

But I enjoy it so much.

It sucks that you‚Äôre experiencing this for hours now, and that it has been exasperated because of COVID. Maybe seeking help is a good plan, I say this for the both of us. Lately I‚Äôve been having simple delusions because I‚Äôm stuck with daydreaming, so I guess it‚Äôs affecting my daily life. Like, I can believe I held a conversation with someone, or I did something to continue my day but in reality it didn‚Äôt happen. And it leaves me so puzzled."
