Scenario 1: You use goats in analogies.  ""Hey honey... How would you feel if you were married to a GOAT whom you are intensely attracted to in a sexual manner and they wanted to too have kidsssss...??? :333""

Scenario 2: 
Step 1: Become a detective. 
Step 2: Arrest suspect and put them in a room. 
Step 3: Fill room with goats.  
Step 4: Profit. 

Scenario 3: Marry someone with a bestiality fetish. Then expose them to abnormal amounts of goat porn.  Over the course of a few months you should have quite a bit of access to their mind. 😏

Scenario 4: Become a chess grandmaster by wearing a goat face during all tournaments.  Chess is surprisingly easy when you can read minds. 

Scenario 5: Start a cult.  Wear a goat costume. Fill your holy temple with goats.  Lure people into temple.  Prove that you are a living God by reading their mind.  Dress them up as goats.  Extract them of money.  Advertise your cult and gain more followers.  Repeat. 

You could become a God with this power.  You posses a provable supernatural power (mind-reading).  You can determine people's loyalty through the power of goats.  And most importantly- you can bang girls super ez with 0/10 effort by dressing up as a goat and seeing who has a fetish.  >;D"

In my humble opinion I think this outweighs any justice the death penalty brings.

RoleReversal,fipb7rw,t1_fip7d4m,1582602286.0,">They are more often in positions of authority

Men tend to seek positions of power more than women.  In addition to this their lives are far more likely to be centered exclusively around their job/businesses hence more male CEOs and Entrepreneurs. 

>They aren't expected to be the caretaker in a relationship 

True and this needs to change.  That being said whether this is an advantage or disadvantage is entirely dependent on subjective desires. Many men want to take on a more traditional ""caretaker"" role but are discouraged due to:
- Stigma against men not being the provider of their household
- Stigma against men interacting with children (Ex: Men + Children, must equal pedophile in the eyes of society). 
- Stigma against men being emotionally in touch and in turn being empathetic and understanding how properly comfort and help other's
- So on so forth. 

>They aren't constantly being objectified

This one is a valid point.  I can't deny that women aren't commonly objectified. However with that in mind please consider that
1. It's a double edged sword.  Women indeed are objectified more often, but both men and women are biologically programmed to give women preferential treatment. And
2. When women are objectified they get support.  When men are objectified albeit less commonly, no one gives a shit. 

With this in mind I can't say that this is an advantage or disadvantage.  It's simply a matter of preference. Do you preference having social bias in your favor bbut be bjectified more often?  Or have no social bias in your favor and be objectified less? 

>There are certainly scenarios in which women are the privileged ones, but we most certainly live in a patriarchal society

In the Western world at least this is not the case.  If we did live in a patriarchal society men would be given systematic benefits legally.  However this is not the case, in fact the opposite is true as the Government give women free handouts for things such as college, give women less jail time for the same crime, push for ""women quotas"", and so on so forth.  And this all happens in a social environment pushing the protection of women (Ex: Women and children get off the plane first, or the controversial question of ""If a women hits a man *can the man hit back????"" O-o* ) 

Also none of the things you listed are ""systematic advantages"" per say as none of them have anything to do with the law, their just social norms. 

>Honestly I don't know what thought process resulted in you being on this subreddit if you weren't tangentially aware of this

I do my best to keep my more conservative beliefs and dating preferences separate.  In addition to this a lot of the problems discussed by male rights activists are things that drive men to this sub (ex: Men not getting affection, stigma against men expressing emotion, men being expected be the provider, etcetera).  While not being on the same side of the political spectrum I think a lot of male rights activist would totally support this subreddit.
