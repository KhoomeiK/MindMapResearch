BDSMcommunity,fqbk9ii,t3_ghpeod,1589238554.0,"So I found a mistress online, and we had a good back-and-forth in character, and she asked for ""tribute"". Alarm bells rang in my head, and I told her I can only pay her cash (in person, so I'm not getting scammed). I seriously thought that was what tribute was. She got offended and said she wanted a video of me or something. So, what are some good ""tributes""? And was I wrong for thinking she was asking for cash?"

BDSMcommunity,fms3njw,t3_fw0g5s,1586345514.0,"Do any of you have fantasies that seem like BDSM fantasies, but aren't sexual, or perhaps blur the line between sexual and non-sexual?

I've (M) had kidnap fantasies since I was a little kid. Since I've hit puberty and understood kinks, I've strictly associated these fantasies with sex. Recently though, I've noticed that I enjoy these fantasies without getting aroused.

On the other hand, since I was 12, I've had a fantasy where I get in a car accident or have an illness or stop a bullet for someone, and end up in a hospital with non-life- threatening injuries for a period of time. I'm cared for by doctors, nurses, and loved ones and I can just relax and live care free. This fantasy seems to be strictly asexual, but I feel like it closely relates to the kidnap fantasies. In both scenarios, I am completely vulnerable and have to be cared for by other people (the kidnapper has to feed me, right?). In both scenarios, I have to stay in one place and await my fate, as I have no control.

What do you guys think?"
