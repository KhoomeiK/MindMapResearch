Try FL Studio, it's TOTALLY worth it. Here's one I made with it: https://youtu.be/npFr8XkyNFo

The great thing is, you can just load a pitch-corrected sample into FL's channel rack, then paste midi data into its piano roll and voila. If it sounds stupid then just use NewTone to autotune the samples into each note instead (basically, load the sample into Newtone, then copy/paste it a bunch of times, then shift all the samples into a chromatic scale, then record/export from Newtone, then load that file into Slicex and click ""detect pitch regions"". Voila 2.0, except harder, maybe I ought to make a tutorial).

Downside is FL won't make the video part of it, which is why I'm working on a script."
YTPMV,fq3ce8w,t3_gggx47,1589065061.0,"Yes. Don't use a pitch +- tool in a video editor for the audio, or it will sound really crappy.

To make the audio, you ought to get a DAW. I recommend FL Studio because you can use it for free to make quick projects (you need to buy a license to reopen saved projects).

As for the video, a lot of people use Vegas, but tbh, Vegas is extremely frustrating and unnecessarily time consuming because of how unreliable it is. You may be better off with freeware, or Premiere Pro if you can.

Currently, although I despise Vegas, I'm working on a Vegas script that will automatically make YTPMV, but who knows how many more months before that's completed. 🤷‍♂️"
