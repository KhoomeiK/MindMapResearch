I started off filling it really low and found out I like it more firm to tuck under my neck and I kind of lay diagonal with it.  You don’t have to refill it often I can feel when some of the water has evaporated and the I dump it out and refill.  It’s my favorite pillow by far and I tried a ton!!!

My own boys who did pretty average in school in the sixth grade are floundering.  At home there is too much distraction and there is no routine.  We tried to keep a schedule for them but none of us could really stick to it.  I don’t know the material they need help with and they are self conscious about tell their teachers.  They cry all the time because this is stressful!!

I have 27 seven year olds in my one room...can you imagine them wearing masks?  Do you know how many of their parents would send them to school and would give them Tylenol and have a fever by noon?  I get they have jobs and it’s hard to take time off for illness but I’m scared.  I have teachers and other staff in our building with health conditions and it scares me.  Do we have recess?  Do we eat in the cafeteria?  Do we have gym, music, or art?  Will those rooms be sanitized before the next class goes in?  What happens when an adult or student tests positive?  Can they even get tested?  What about my own kids?  They were premature with breathing issues that still linger. I’m frustrated, I’m sad, and I’m scared.
