skyrim,fqv2gti,t3_gl2p7c,1589668546.0,"I'd have to say having a character that specializes in stealth/archery is very OP and fun, you feel like medival Sniper lol. Although some tasks and quests will require more up front and personal combat so whenever I go Archer I also use a two handed Great sword if I need to do any meelee combat, it's lighter and more efficient than carrying a shield and one handed weapon, making it easy to switch from bow to sword quickly. Bow+great sword+ light armor you can't  go wrong with a classic Ranger build. 
I'm just speaking from personal preference and experience but feel free to try it it's really fun."

Then after a couple days of doing that open the door while they eat. And continue to socialize them with each other at feeding time. Also make sure they have plenty of cat toys to stimulate them, cats need to hunt, catch, kill, eat, groom, sleep in that order as their biological routine. YouTubers like Jackson Galaxy and Kitten Lady are great sources of information on cat behavior."
