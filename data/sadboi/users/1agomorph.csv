They were overprotective and I was independent and headstrong so I really struggled with this. I was a good kid but they never believed that I had good intentions, and they were especially repressive when it came to being with men, even having male platonic friends was not allowed. I started planning moving out when I was 16 and started saving money by working weekend jobs. I ended up falling in love with someone and started staying out late to be with him, which my mother *hated*. It was her last bit of control slipping away. During this time, I was searching for my own apartment and lined everything up so that I could move out quickly, not telling her. Finally, one night I came home late after being with my boyfriend (my first love!) and she lost it and threatened that I couldn't live there if I was going to come in late, so I said that I already had another place. It was extremely satisfying to finally be in control of my own life and choices for the very first time and know that she couldn't do anything. Absolutely no regrets!

botany,fpe892j,t3_gcsnfl,1588542328.0,"Every wild species contains an enormous amount of evolutionary potential. The greater the genetic diversity in a species, the greater the possibility for new mutations and combinations which can aid adaptation. This potential allows species to adapt to different environmental changes, as they have for millenia. As we move into an era of ever increasing climate instability, it is important to preserve as much of this evolutionary potential as possible, which will increase resilience to climate change.

Domesticated plants and animals typically contain low genetic diversity since we have removed much of it from the gene pool through controlled breeding. These species therefore have lower evolutionary potential and will be less adaptable to new pests and extreme weather events as a result of climate change. By keeping as many wild species as possible (i.e. biodiversity), we hold onto a wealth of genetic information which allows species to adapt to changes in the environment through an increase in genetic diversity (put simply, many different genes in combination = greater ability to evolve). Some species even contain latent genes which are believed to have arisen during similar climatic conditions in the past. These genes are now being activated under current climatic change, helping these species to rapidly keep in sync with new weather patterns. This phenomenon is called ""genetic plasticity"", and can be seen in many insects.

When we lose species like this, piece by piece we  lose global resilience to environmental change. In terms of how this affects humans, others have commented on how the ecosystem is like a house made of bricks, and others have mentioned ecosystem services. Basically the more genetic diversity we have, the more resilient our ecosystem  is to environment change and this affects us directly since we are completely reliant on a functioning ecosystem for clean air, water and food through nutrient cycling, of which all species play a part. If any of this collapses, we are screwed. There has recently been discussion about environment tipping points; how many species can we lose before we reach a point of no return where these necessary ecosystem services collapse. No one knows for sure, but this is an active research area."

Lithops,fp12d95,t1_foztlwc,1588222541.0,"This needs better soil mix, which you can make yourself. You should use a 90/10 inorganics to organics ratio, where 90% inorganic material is pumice or very fine gravel (not sand) and 10% organic material, like cactus mix. It should dry quickly after watering, so a small pot dries faster that a large one. You can repot into a larger pot, just not too big and definitely with good drainage. When you repot, remove all the old soil around the roots carefully. In terms of watering, these are not on a strict watering cycle like Lithops. It's good for them to have multiple sets of leaves (unlike Lithops). So you do not need to wait for them to absorb leaves before watering. They like more water than Lithops but you must make sure the soil is totally bone dry before watering. They like droughts too, so don't water too often. How often you water depends on a lot of factors, like how dry the air is where you live, how much light it's getting (are you using an artificial lamp? These need a lot of light to be happy). I would say judge based on how quickly the soil dries after watering with the new soil mix. You can tell it's dry by lifting the pot and feeling it's weight. Once the soil is dry, wait a few weeks before watering. Bottom-water by placing the pot in a dish and letting it absorb. Hope this helps!"
