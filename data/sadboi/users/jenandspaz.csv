They would slam doors all the time. Things would fall off the walls. Every time he ran my apartment shook. Literally vibrated. Child free apartments don't exist where I'm from. That's discriminatory but damn I wish they did. It's just entitled parents raising entitled children. No all parents and kids but many.
