If you have trouble on having too much weapon:

- Grid Essential weapons : Keep

- Skilled R weapon as skill fodder

- Gatcha SR for reduce (unless you like to keep weapons, like me, keep 1, reduce the rest)

- Gatcha SSRs for keep (if character weapon usually I'd keep 1 flb) or reduce (if you're not using it n not really important for grid)

- Grand Weapons: KEEP

- Farmable SR & SSR - use as skill fodder. Refer to wiki on how many to get sk10 to sk20

- Rusted Weapons- HOARDS EM ALL

-Angel weapons - chuck it into Vessel"
Granblue_en,fjxyid4,t3_ffdf0h,1583686242.0,"Use your Journey Drop to activate drop rate for an hour (10 Journey Drop per hour, can activate as many as you want). If you're grinding daily, that should not be a problem. If your grid is decent, use friend's Kaguya or flb Nobiyo to increase drop rate.

Omega/magna weapons benefits greatly with Omega main summons, especially at 4* Summons. Look for weapon skill Majesty, Might for ATK based or Emnity for emnity based grid. Primal grid uses Gatcha weapons, so be on lookout on weapons that have the skills above.

Team synergy is more on trial & error. Some might suggest to have a core character & build around them. Example for my wind I have 4* Siete as my core. He is a beast but his Swordshine lvl is tricky to manage. So need a defender (Grimnir, Gawain, Arcarum Monika etc) and buffer/debuffer (Andira, Arriet, swimsuit Jeanne etc). So from here I chose Siete, Andira & Grimnir since Andira can buff/debuff while Grimnir is atker/def for his awesome shield. The back row character dont matter much (usually for character need to lvl up), unless the character has back row abilities (such as Young Cat or Arcarum Evokers)"
