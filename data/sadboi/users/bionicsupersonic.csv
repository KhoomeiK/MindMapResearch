SuicideWatch,fcjz7uv,t3_ehegyu,1577711373.0,"You do you on your time! No one knows the pace of your journey but you. Chances are the people who are saying these things feel trapped by these very things; marriage, kids, etc. Remember, misery loves company....if someone is forcing something on you, search for the motive. It likely has little to do with you. Love & Light and don't back down"
SuicideWatch,fbpvhks,t3_ee0x69,1577025472.0,"You're dehydrating yourself. Benadryl is an antihistamine. It blocks histamines from forming, histamines are your body's natural reaction to allergens and cause mucus. Benadryl will dry up the mucus but it also dries out any other part of the body that should be moist...eyes, mouth, vagina, stool, your organs, etc."

Btw: yours look great and not scarce"
SuicideWatch,fblrv2f,t1_fb84g37,1576968667.0,"Absolutely, I do. My daughters don't deserve the kind of pain and questions my death would cause. I'll keep going because it's what I do. I scripted & signed the contract for a lifetime of love & devotion when I brought them into the world. Causing them the pain of their mother's suicide would be breach of contract....a contract that I forced them into."

I have worked with children who stutter using music therapy. The brain works differently when singing than it does when you're talking. There is new research to suggest you can retrain your brain. www.StutteringHelp.org

Dreadlocks,fbjly1v,t3_edekt5,1576936029.0,Ugh...How do your dreads look so neat? Maybe it's the hair texture. They look great. I'm hoping mine start to look more twisted and less stuck in a light socket.

SuicideWatch,fb78yvz,t3_ebspd5,1576580477.0,"I've reached out numerous times and nothing. I've mentioned suicide to both of my adoptive parents. One today ignores my words, the other tells me how they know how I feel or threatens that I don't know what real sadness is. The one and only thing keeping me here is my ten yo daughter."
Dreadlocks,fb17gy2,t3_e8gyu3,1576433145.0,"So, thanks for responding y'all. I did have a friend start them for me. I have been using products from Dollylocks; shampoo, tightening spray. I shampoo as infrequently as possible, usually once every 10-14 days. I've heard so many conflicting reports on how often to wash them. 
I did do research before getting dreads. I actually planned for about two years, growing my hair to a length that I thought would give me decent length dreads. I plan on this being the last ""hair style"".
I palm roll them regularly and separate them."
