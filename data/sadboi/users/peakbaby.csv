Anxiety,fppte2n,t3_geiyn7,1588808780.0,"I have the same problem. I noticed that throughout my years in school I have never miserably failed. And I think we're all bound to face a big fat failure at least once in our lifetime? So now that I'm about to take the most important test of my life, I find myself putting it off again and again because I'm so afraid that this is it, it's probably time. But aside from the big tasks, I also do it with small ones, like even writing on my journal!! It's really bad :("

SafeSexPH,fp1r2a9,t3_gatii7,1588245147.0,"I've been on trust pills for around 8 months now and it's been smooth I think? Cause I'm not sure if my mood swings is a side effect or if it's bc I need to go back to my psych lmao. But other than that, the only difference i noticed talaga was how short and less the flow has become. That's it no nausea, breakouts, nada. And it's a really effective contraceptive. My partner and I haven't used any other birth control method aside from my pills.

Did you consult a doctor for this? :)"

Also, you should know that since it is viral, best to take care of yourself, and not let your immune system down. That makes you susceptible to it."
