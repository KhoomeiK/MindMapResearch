schizoaffective,f7zg86n,t3_dy6g5u,1574110234.0,"Absolutely.  I think it's because antipsychotics dull your response to emotional triggers and morality is largely an emotional phenomenon (actions or thoughts that are ""wrong"" provoke a negative response like embarrassment or anger, actions or thoughts that are ""right"" provoke positive thoughts like joy or pride)

Add in some benzodiazepines like Clonazapam you're pretty much officially amoral.  It's something you really have to keep in mind when navigating the world as a medicated schizoid."

I'd rather sleep all day and have the occasional beer with friends without being uncomfortable myself and making them uncomfortable.
