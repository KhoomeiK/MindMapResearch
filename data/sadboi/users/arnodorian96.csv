LGBDropTheT,fqz60oy,t3_gl33k7,1589760607.0,"I think the worst mistake the lgb communities around the world have committed is following everything the american community does as valuable.  From drag queens to the made up genres to the transgender hormones therapy I've seen magazines around the world desperately trying to defend that even if the comments found it hilarious. Because, as you guessed it, you all have internalized homophobia or a straight acting if you don't follow what the holy american lgbtxqwrq community does.  Personally, I think my country would accept gay couples a bit more if they haven't defended drag queens in the pride parade which I personally find it exaggerated.

I don't know how Spain, France, Belgium, Holland, the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark,Iceland, Germany, Finland, Luxembourg, Italy,Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada deal with this but from what I've seen, most of this nonsense comes from the U.S.

And I could give tons of example. Americans get to say whatever the lgb community must do and say yet they were one of the last first world to have most gay rights. 

Let's face this, specially for those of you americans. The U.S. is a very religiously conservative nation in levels as big as any south american nation or eastern european country.  With that in mind, americans should be really careful or one day all the advances you'd made will be gone in just a couple of years.  And these type of images doesn't help and gives talking points to radical conservatives in countries like mine. So, thanks to these people you will erase any advance that socially conservative nations like most of Latin America have done in the last decades. 

And I think of three consequences: 

a) Let's picture a gay or bi teenager living in the U.S. acknowledging he likes guys or guys and girls yet he somehow finds out about the made up genres, that he is transphobic if he doesn't dates a trans person or that he necessarilly needs to support these drag kids because is ""progressive"".  I can tell you, for sure, that the kid will either never come out or will avoid his attraction to guys.

b) I think that for better or worse, the european right has from a moderate to a neutral stance on religion in comparison to their american counterparts, and that's why you will find many of them supporting lgb couples. (Even the swedish far right is slightly pro gay) so when all the transgender bullshit falls they will face a bit of homophobia but likely most rights will remain. But Americans? No matter how many pro gay republicans they are, the evangelical right (which sounds like the falangists of the 30's from Spain) will always prevail and in less than a generation you can say goodbye to same sex marriage, adoption and most same sex rights. 

And they get the best thing, because in Latin America the rise of homophobia will be massive as well as the talks of gay conversion and believe me, they will use images like the drag kids from there to convince society that is the future if their son or daughter has same sex attraction."

If Hitler goes to the U.S. then he likely ends up being in a silent movie as a famous drama actor (after all his love of Wagner might play a role here).  As far as I remember, his anti-semitic views came to him while he  was at Vienna, so I don't think he developes these views while in the U.S. He doesn't transition well into talking films and likely ends up forgotten and dying in one of the Motion Picture retirement homes. 

But if he stays in Germany? One way or another, he ends up serving in the german army. Without his experience in Vienna that introduced him to anti-semitic ideas, he likely ends up fighting in the war but still with the bitter feeling a lot of soldiers felt after the defeat. But instead of ending up in politics he uses that hatred for being an actor during the height of the german expressionism.  Maybe Hitler and Dietrich act together in The Blue Angel.  

Chaplin ends up in the military but I don't think he would have pursued a career in politics. He likely stays in England being an activists but rarely gets to be someone important.

OnlyChild,fqn7eup,t3_gjt282,1589489929.0,"Quite similar story, but here's what I did. 

My mom's side of the family isn't that big. My only aunt and cousin live in Spain and until I know them, I can't be certain how things will go. My mom did met them two years ago when she traveled there and told me it would be fine so maybe who knows, considering my cousin is an only child too, we could be close.

In the case, of my father's side, well they never were actually good even before the divorce. I remember a Christmas where my uncles forgot my gift despite my parents invested money in good gifts for my cousins. After, the divorce, my aunt tried to be close to us but later it turned out she was acting as a spy for my father during the divorce.  I tried to put difference asides with them, but they watched me as if I was a traitor or a pariah to their side of the family.  At the time divorce happened, my cousisn were 10 years old so I thought as they would get older maybe they would make questions and we could get along. But now, they are 18 and reasonably mature and they haven't reached to me to have any contact whatsoever. So, for me, that's it.  I don't care. They might share my same blood but they are as valuable as a neighbour that is unknown to me.  

There are two dates where it does get hard: Christmas and New Year's eve. You hear stories of friends or other people that have large gatherings with their family and with games and a party so you feel kinda sad that you are family isn't like that, but if you care more about the moment you are living rather than the size of people you are living that moment with, it doesn't have to be bad. 

I plan to go to Spain to study there for a year and hopefully visit the country, and of course my family there, but even though I'd like to stay there, I think I'm too close to my mom and until I know I can leave her and my grandma safely, I could think in moving out to a foreign country. 

I have friends, but I think that they haven't being tested in the most important thing that at least for me makes a difference between a friend and family and that's it, an emergency.

In all honesty, although I feel slowly more attracted to men, I'd choose a woman to settle. I don't like gay bars because they sound so exclusionary nor romantic apps so even if I do end up meeting a normal looking guy, chances are that he is one of the crazy defenders of the alphabet soup.

I don't know if it's possible to hate or feel ashamed that much of your sexuality that you loose most romantic interest in it.

Straight people can live their entire lifes without caring about politics but here you gotta constantly be an activist and a terrible one if you look up the insane arguments being used.

But love or sex doesn't dictate my life. There's far too many thing in life to care about it so I try to live first thinking in my goals.

I learnt how to ride a bike, to swim, I went to a summer camp and even got a pet which eventually made me surpass my fear of going out on my own. Yes, my mom is  a bit overbearing too but if anything my mom has taught me to be independent on my own and since my father left I basically do everything in the house from cooking to cleaning the floors. But the thing I couldn't understand as I lacked any major contact without any kid for a large part of my life, was friendships and relationship. This led to me to have friends that used me for the money I earnt while I had a small job and me thinking I was normal, some using me out of need because I was a good student specially in history and finally a destructive relationship that happened because I was so clueless in not seeing the red flags that it was destroying my life. 

&#x200B;

My point is, that there's always the other side of the coin where your lack of social contact can make you naive to the things in the world and you might have committed mistakes that you could regret all your life.  At least you had cousins that I'm sure were around your age. I didn't had anyone of my age in my life during the most part of it so I had to use whatever information I could gather from the internet or books to try to understand people."

First of all, don't worry about crying and do it as much as you can to vent your sadness.  What exactly do you feel?  Do you feel you could have done something or about the last words with your dad?

Right now, I feel that it would be helpful if you, your sister and your mother would support each other right now. I read in the comments that she was the one that found him so I imagine she must feel really bad for seeing the gruesome image. Don't close yourself to the internet.

The carlist wars: After king Fernando VII decided to give the throne to his daughter Isabel against the salic wall, his brother would start a movement that in the next decades not only would be against the Borbon line in the throne but also against liberalism and secularism. Even many of them fought along Franco during the civil war."
OnlyChild,fpwidgr,t3_gfnq52,1588963978.0,"I had that experience until the quarantine. Before this, I used to go out alone only if it was  dog friendly place so at least I could take my dog or if it was a library. But then I began to feel depressed to be just on my own doing these things.   But now, if anything this quarantine has taught me is that life is short and that one should not waste time. 

When this end, I will enjoy time not only my friends but also with my family. People forget that sometimes your family (depending on circumstances of course) can be helpful to avoid that feeling so I will go out more with them.  But also, the best advice you need to understand that no matter how many friends or family you have, sometimes they might not be interested or have time in doing what you like. So you have two options, never try that because you'll be alone or try it and have and awesome experience. 

I read that you want to do solo travel but you're scared. I want to go to Spain to study there for a year and while being there I want to travel the country or even reach parts of France. Believe me, I will be scared too but knowing I will achieve my dream gives me strength to do it or you'll regret all your life that you never did that thing because you did it alone."

LGBDropTheT,fpu6jml,t3_gf0zh9,1588905756.0,"I think there are some harsh realities lgb people should accept and activists are closing these legitimate concerns and I kinda get it. It's like the Simpson's episode where Lisa discovers the town hero was a bloodthirsty pirate but seeing the impact this would cause she forgets it for the good of the town.  I think that many activists try to close these circumstances because it would likely affect the movement in third world countries.

A)  The first thing I'd agree would be the idea of a gay gene. I remember one time a friend told me some of his gay friends were raped and from then they were gay. How to explain this? Were they forever like that or was a trauma event?  What about lesbians? What about bisexual people? So it's hard to tell. I remember there was an study which said the gay gene existed but it was likely influenced by other factors during pregnancy or even environment but sadly it can't be changed.  Is it natural? Yes but influenced by other events.

B) The other claims about certain physical traits an homosexual person might have sounds more like the typical gaydar joke. I haven't found any serious claims to it. And it practically omits bisexual people where there are not butch bisexuals nor effeminate bisexuals. 

3) Bisexual people might be the key to understnd sexuality in my opinion. Why they end up with an attraction to both genders?  Personally, I have a bit more of sexual attraction to women but more romantically attracted to women. I used to have a bit more attraction to my male side but seeing all the crazyness from the community as well as the casual sex that is defended as a revolutionary act practically has destroyed my attraction to them. So it does raise the question once again of how much events or factors can shape a sexuality?  

Finally, people deny harsh truth that happens.  From personal experience  that a friend told me and from the things I've learnt from the internet is that gay men are more sexual than their straight counterparts. I can't be sure of lesbians or bisexual people but in general commitment is rarely seen and that can be easily seen in any of the major gay magazines around the world where there's more sex related articles than whatever Playboy ever did or the insane defense of bizarre sex in whatever place you want because it's not heteronormative. Even in the CNN documentary, the 80's they showed a report where they said an average gay man had around 500 sexual partners and  28% percent of them around 1000. How to defend that?  I don't know how that goes for lesbians or bisexual people so I'm leaving them out.  

Even now, the way Grindr is used has already raised concerns about the new sexual promiscuity among gay people.  And unlike the first example, this isn't applied just to americans because I've seen similar articles and experiences in Spain and Latin America. And despite how many people tell you that straight people can contract more aids, gay people are still the most prone to get it. 

The usual argument is well yeah straight people do it too. Sure but not to the vast majority of them like it's usually the case here and in fact all that sex crazy culture can confuse you. Imagine a gay  kid accepting his sexuality just to see his life will always be surrounded of people who make their sexuality their main personality trait.  Let's say that you did end up falling in love with a guy but then you find out you must obligatory put your gay flag everywhere, talk about being gay, going to gay pride, to gay bars, always talking as if ""the gays"" were an entire group and finally if you follow politics, haven't the right to follow more right wing attitudes being condemned. And that's the good part because I'm denying that unless you live in Western Europe, North America and most of Oceania, you will live a life of sadness, rejection and homophobia.  

Personally, I thank that I'm bi. I can't change that I like guys but I can choose to live a life with a girl if that happens.  If not, that's ok. 

Don't try to change your sexuality. Good or bad, it's just there. I know love or a relationship might be this wonderful thing to live but just consider the work and sacrifices you might have to do by being in one, even if it is a woman. 

Just live to yourself, your family or friends or even to a hobbie."

Everyone around the world know that even if quarantine stops there won't be major events in a while and it seems that's something your country does not understand.

I've reached a point in my life where the logic of a kid is way more understanding for me that the logic of love. I mean, I had my mom arriving each day during two years and being in her room crying. I never understood if it was either a job thing, the divorce or her ovaries surgery but nevertheless even though I felt depressed because I too had my own issues, I tried to forget it for a minute and came to her room or take her to the living room just to talk about something stupid but to spent time together. Romantic love on the other hand sounds to me like a bigger mental effort than raising a kid.

intj,fpom3hj,t3_geh6a7,1588786789.0,"Not with events but with people. I don't know but I think everyone follows a pattern in life and depending on personalities and or decisions you could tell what's going to happen in a near future.  I haven't liked always this sort of prediction habit I have. 

I'm going to put a couple of examples. In high school, I knew my best friend who was antisocial wasn't like that by her choice but rather by circumstances so I knew the moment she would enter either a camp or meet a new friend she would leave this personality and become more outgoing. The first thing happened and she went to a camp, then I knew the camp would make her open up the world but her insecurity would make her experiment with some type of personalities before she could find an stable one.  So she went from phases in which she was punk to one where she felt like a stereotype version of the pretty girl in a high school film. I knew that during one of these phases she would feel ashamed of being around me and our frienship would tremble. All of these things happened. 

In some cases I've been wrong in small cases. I knew my former bully would turn into a womanizer and would barely finish high school to then end up with drug issues. But although he graduated at 19, as far as I know, he hasn't ended up with drug issues and apparently has matured. 

So yeah, in summary the pattern most people follow around life or based in their decision can be analysed and thus you could foresee their future."
intj,fpojxyf,t1_fpnlr4a,1588785762.0,"Sure. Back in 2012 I went to this place where kids of all ages would stay after school to do their homeworks until their parents would pick them up. One day this 12 year old kid (I was 14) came and just like in most of my life I didn't really cared.  Then when my mom came to pick me up, I was searching for my backpack and I desperately tried to look it up until I saw this kid hiding it between his legs.  That was a rather lame joke but the following months he would make even little kids make fun of me and would annoy me until one day I finally cried so the teachers called their parents and apparently that was the end of it. 

One day, during a slow day where most kids where picked up after class by their parents or went in the school bus, the homework place was mostly empty. I like my solitude so after eating lunch I went to the garden and I read a book until this kid came to me. He did small talk but I didn't talked much. Just after I earned a bit of confidence, the next time we talked a sort of friendship began. 

Here was the thing. The whole experience taught me to follow more my logic than my feelings or my hormones. The friendship had some good moments at first but then he began to feel ashamed of being around me so he would stop contact. That went on for a while until we began to sexually experiment (I won't further explain that). Now after all these years, I understand that I did what I did and tried to see if the friendship could work is because at that time I wasn't that close to my now best friend and I desperately wanted to fit in and be like the others. I didn't had much contact with what was the regular high school experience so I investigated on the internet what that meant. As usual, the internet isn't always right so I had this image in my head that we would become best friends and I forced things even if they were detrimental to my life. In the end, I finally had enough and finished the friendship. I never understood if he was really sexually confused or if he was hiding his sexuality. People are not easy to understand. 

But what I did learnt is that I shall think first with my logic and then with my feelings. And until now that has helped me. Oh and that things never go well if you force them."

I just let things flow and go. I never understood the point of talking to a complete stranger and then suddenly becoming friends.  The best that has worked for me is to go to events, groups or camps and then participating in the activities but not focusing on making friends. Through an opportunity or ocassion, I get along with a person and hopefully I end up having a friend. The worst friendships I've made are the ones that were forced.

Even a bully with whom I had a very strange relationship of friendship and lust, appeared out of nothing.

AskReddit,fpf5w9b,t3_gd3kwu,1588562541.0,"Two things: My wisdom tooth surgery and this quarantine.

Last year, it wasn't a good moment for me and my mom. I had earned a few bucks of a small job I got before graduating and used it to go to the dentist. I haven't been to one since my parents divorced in 2012.  Turns out I had a lot of cavities and the remains of my braces that haven't been taken since the last time I went there but also all my four wisdom tooth were growing very big.  My mom had to pay my dad a large amount of money so he couldn't evict us from our apartment and when my mom said she didn't had enough money for the surgery she asked me to try to see if my dad could help. The jerk told me he would do it if it he was on the mood.  

Me and my mom cried in the parking lot of the dentist office for a while and I told her it didnt' mattered if I had to wait or until I could get a job. Fortunately my grandma paid for the surgery and I spent with her two weeks while I was recovering. She has lived alone there with just her two dogs and a few neighbour and it made me realise the importance of family. I have been dissapointed thousands of times by friends even after I invited them drinks or tickets to the movies yet I never experienced much time with my grandma and while being there I learnt how despite it's loneliness she was quite loved in the neighborhood and never missed an hour at day to either do gardening or even laugh about a Youtube video.

Finally, this quarantine taught me how much you take for granted normal things like going to the park or to the movies. At first, I was scared of going to the movies or eating alone in case my friends couldn't go but now I feel I not only want to do more things in my city that I feared of doing them alone but also get out of my comfort zone.

AskReddit,fpf4ybp,t3_gd3lp4,1588561898.0,"Back in February, me and my mom we were staying with my grandma at her house. For reasons that I don't want to explain we got into a fight and the day we gotta leave an entire month of bad luck began.  First, the food my grandma made us to eat when we arrive was not refrigerated so when we arrived home we thought it look good and then eat it. We spent two days with diarrhea.

A few days later I began to see my dog moving so much while she was trying to sleep so I thought that she might be sick. Before taking her to the vet, I decided to give her a bath and turns out she had fleas. At first we followed the natural remedies from my grandma but it didn't worked out so my mom told me I should clean the entire apartment. I was almost bitten by some very weird black spiders and sadly despite my best try the fleas didn't go. 

The next day I gave a bath to my dog once again and also cut her hair ( an idea my mom gave me) and I cut it but then while I was watching i saw a small part of skin was ripped from part of his back. Not a very big thing but very worrying. With half of the house still having to be cleaned up I had to take her to the vet who was closing in half an hour. I tried to get an Uber but the Uber never came so I had to take a normal taxi. When I finally got to the vet, the vet basically yelled at me for making all of this and not take her quickly to the vet. She gave her an anti flea medicine and thought things will finally would be better. 

That weekend me and my mom decided to clean up the entire apartment once again and while we were moving out a table, a glass souvenir my mom bought at Paris that was very valuable felt to the floor and my mom got instantly mad. We fought and the rest of the day turned out to be a nightmare.

Finally, fucking fleas didn't die and before I could take her to the vet again, quarantine began. I was even planning to see my friends after I hadn't see them since December. The only good thing that happened in March was that our vet told us to buy a more strong anti fleas medicine, a sort of pill that she had to eat and that lasted a month. We did it and then cleaned up the house once again and finally we were free of those fleas.

So for me march is the best representation of this damn year."

DecidingToBeBetter,fpbbi3q,t3_gcdufe,1588466264.0,"I don't think I was on an addiction but there was a time where I basically just whenever I got bored I just went seeing porn.  It actually helped me because the time I lost watching porn I earn it again and I can accomplish more things in a day.

And it even it make me feel better when masturbating. A mental image can be much better than something that is created, exaggerated and most of the time false."
TrueOffMyChest,fp8uaxs,t1_fp8nmwp,1588403230.0,"Read Anthony Beevor's book about the war. Basically, republicans were dominated by anarchists and communists factions who created a secret police in their territories in many cases with the Republican government having no power to stop them and rounding every person suspicious of having right wing ideas and in many cases innocent people, soldiers and of course priests felt into that violence. Or the forced expropiations.
In the national part, there were awful cases like a group of falangists that raped the wife of a republican mayor and later killed her. And of course, the irrational decision to shot Lorca."
science,fp8du4n,t3_gbs4ap,1588389810.0,I don't get the test participants had to do. I don't think you need a girlfriend to know that doing something stupid like going through an intersection with the risk of having a car crash is not something quite smart. No matter how money it says you might win. If anything it shows men who are more impulsive do better when being with a couple but other more independent type of men wouldn't see any difference between being with a girlfriend or single.

depression,fp7rmyv,t1_fp7h5py,1588376368.0,"Well, in terms of friends, you could meet someone through your trips or even through your book preferences. I don't believe in meeting someone online so maybe you should see clubs around your area. 
With parents and friends, love shouldn't be that important."
TrueOffMyChest,fp7g1jm,t1_fp67t46,1588369943.0,Every american should read about the spanish civil war. That's the best example of two sides being equally bad and extremist.
TrueOffMyChest,fp7fw2y,t3_gbgtal,1588369862.0,"FINALLY. But it's not Reddit. Every fucking american show, tv, internet video or page ALWAYS ends up with their disastrous and divisive politics being brought up. 

I don't give a fuck how fucked up your millenial american life is nor how much Trump is making america great again. STOP IT."
depression,fp7f2ai,t1_fp7ewg3,1588369422.0,"But why not spent time with your parents? Isn't that love worthable too? I mean, I admire you for traveling that much. It's amazing."
depression,fp7dkfd,t3_gbjoku,1588368619.0,"Love is not this magical or fantasy thing you are watching in movies and reading in novels. Behind the happy facade there are a lot of issues within marriages and relationships.

Imagine how many married couples are unhappy and wish to just travel half of what you've travelled. Imagine how many people don't have the time to even do something outside their jobs. Love is not worthable because even with people you could still be unhappy. 

And love it's not only romantic love. When was the last time you spent time with your parents? Or that you amde something with them? Or when was the last time you spent time with friends? Even a puppy can give you a unique type of love and also through that experience you could meet new people that could become friends.

Don't give a damn about love. If you're feeling exhausted then try something new. How many of those books have you published? Is there a genre that you haven't read yet? Is thre a place you would like to come back? Or a new place you wanna know? Or perhaps a new hobbie you wanna try? Piano? Painting?

And finally, although it's a bit difficult you could still become a parent.  You can search on the internet stories about single parents or even join the adoption sub so others can help you with that."
OnlyChild,fp53kn7,t3_gbbene,1588315172.0,"Not exactly of everything but I do fear my mom's reaction in certain topics. In general, I have a very good relationship with her so I tell her most things including my fears but I do fear what she will think on a career choice I want to make or a future plan. 

My biggest fear though about her reaction is my sexuality. I'm bi but fortunately I like girls a bit more so hopefully I will never have to tell her."
Vent,fp3krpu,t3_gavw22,1588281036.0,"Americans should go see my country to understand that this disease is not a joke. Corpses rotting on the streets and a lack of coffins for those that were dying in one of the most stricken cities of my country.   This is not a joke and those marching on the streets I ask you:

You are americans living in one of the richest country on the world and if even here in my country the street seller of oranges is respecting the quarantine, why can't you?"
Vent,fp3k4a9,t1_fp2htlf,1588280704.0,I could understand to a degree in my country where street sellers depend from their daily income to eat and yet even them they are trying to stay inside depending on the help from the government or from neighbours. But americans? Aren't you the greatest country on the planet with very good living conditions?
intj,fp3fky6,t1_fp2av2w,1588278441.0,"Follow up questions and sorry if I'm being too intrusive.  How bout your family and friends? Did you feel a bit scared of introducing your partner to them? Did you ever fear of being cheated when your partner went out with his friends? 

I relate completely to the part of sex but more than that how love works so that your partner it's still with you? How did you knew the person you are now with was the one you wanted to spent the rest of your life? How does that feeling can be explained?.

And how does love works when you or your partner are sick? I mean, do you get tired or say why I am taking care of an adult that doesn't shares my blood?"
Futurology,fp166wp,t1_fp00kpb,1588225523.0,">All rational, intelligent people out there realize that cutting oil and airliners out of the picture abruptly is a very bad idea.

Correction: A large majority of the world agrees with this. I liked this sub but is full of first world activists who live in a delusional world. They seriously think third world countries will abandon oil and airplanes out of the sudden."
Futurology,fp15cbd,t3_ga50fb,1588224842.0,"Ok, if that's going to work for the british then good for them but don't expect my third world country nor any of the countries in Latin America or Africa or Asia to follow this delusional plan.  

How the hell does he wans to ban oil completely out of nowwhere in places where oil production is the main source of it's economy? This guy is esentially sending my country to the brink of collapse and we were there in 2000 and believe me it wasn't nice. 

Then how are you going to survive in a world without airplanes? Specially now that tourism as well as travel need to be reactivated after all this ends.  Does this guy have any ideas to travel outside of planes or should we all go back to the 1890's? 

Again, another first world environmental activist who doesn't know anything of how the world works. 

Yes, I believe in climate change and I believe we must do something but right now this pandemic has changed a lot of the efforts to fight this problem."

I mean, the show itself should have pointed out the importance of the song and not something that equals the songs of ""Rocky"".  It's like if the french would hear someone twerking to Les chant des partisans or even americans (they sure get mad) if they would hear someone twerking to their anthem."
Adoption,fozngo1,t3_gafder,1588193599.0,I'm kinda on the same boat as you. It's my long term goal but regarding the issue of a lack of support system I hope I can have the aid of some friends that likely will remain childless and a cousin that is the only family I have who could become a sort of uncle for my kid.
Adoption,fozkykk,t3_gacy3e,1588192400.0,"Not to be pessimistic but maybe you should also try to search for a more gay friendly country. No matter how many laws Mexico makes for protection, it's just like the vast majority of Latin America: very homophobic.

So for the safety of you both and also for the wellbeing of your child, you should search for more gay friendly countries like Spain or Germany or the UK or Belgium and where also it's a bit easy to adopt for male/male couples."
TrueOffMyChest,foxahsv,t3_g9uqfq,1588138285.0,"The alternative media argument. Listen american,  the same argument you make is made by leftists here too so you're not special. Does world media have very deep issues? Yes, but it's not new. After all William Randolph Hearst said a lot of lies in it's newspapers to support the war with Spain. 

But the alternative media argument is worse than the disease. Let me give you an example here: When violent strikes shooked my country in past october, people said the same words you are applying to your media but then in their ""alternative media"" they basically put the violent acts as very thoughtful acts that were needed as a response to police brutality. 

Journalists will always have their preferences but lately around the world everyone is trying to be the activists of their own particular party. 

Advice: Leave news completely. If you want to know about science then go to a SERIOUS website to get you informed. The science magazine is a very good place to go."

I'm in my early 20's but people in my country settle very young so I kinda relate to the feeling of seeing friends, classmates and relatives getting married.  I still have to be sure if my life would be worthable on my own or with a relationship but thanks for the response."
