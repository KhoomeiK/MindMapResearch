FemaleDatingStrategy,fljbbgn,t3_fi2wko,1585205419.0,I dated a recovering addict who I thought was healthy after7 years. Even had a therapist. But then he got depressed and was complaining every day and was very tired every day.  He went on meds but still was lethargic. His mood and behavior kind of turned me off.  & He said he needed more support from me... like around the house- like I’m responsible for his burn out?? How about you hire a maid vs ask me to do MORE.  So I left him... hopefully it doesn’t make me selfish.

relationship_advice,fl36qjt,t1_fl3636w,1584770791.0,Thank you. Breaking it off was probably the hardest thing I’ve done.
relationship_advice,fl36p8o,t1_fl35smu,1584770752.0,I mean it’s not like I’m divorced with kids with different dads lol
relationship_advice,fl36noy,t1_fl35l5x,1584770706.0,"Well I wanted to get engaged before moving and leaving my career, home etc. Since he was getting his PhD, he couldn’t come to me... but living together he was way too moody. 
Lesson learned: live together before getting engaged!"
relationship_advice,fl36gpu,t1_fl362sm,1584770501.0,Not rushing ... can’t even think about giving any energy to a man right now. Just self care.
relationship_advice,fl36cbw,t3_fm8n19,1584770372.0,Home is comfort and safety. I prefer my own bed vs someone I’m dating. Give her space and FaceTime. You will lose her if you nag and pressure her especially if it feels like she has to choose you or her family...
relationship_advice,fl35oje,t3_fm5u0h,1584769695.0,Please... for your child... leave him!! This is abuse!! Emotional abuse that might get physical. A fart Is not something to be mad about. And when you leave him... have a safe place to stay at- do not give the location. Abusive Men get scary when they are desperate.
relationship_advice,fl34nx2,t3_fly18q,1584768698.0,Go enjoy your life and leave!! Guess what.. he will make u feel guilty for leaving. Don’t play his game trust me I’ve been there.
relationship_advice,fkwoee9,t1_fkwneri,1584599231.0,Thank you. I felt like it was slightly getting emotional abusive. The fear of making him upset — that’s not a normal fear to have. So I need to stop doubting myself.
relationship_advice,fkwobbp,t1_fkwn18s,1584599141.0,Thank you... that’s what I try to do. Is remember the bad. We are just not a good match. After he broke my trust I thought well... now we have one choice and that’s ending it.
