dune,fr58poa,t1_fr548sy,1589904456.0,"Came to comment about this very point. The Imperium largely has technology which far outstrips our modern technology in most fields, there is zero reason for elite soldiers like the Sardaukar to not be wearing plate armor at least the equivalent of the very best plate from Earth's High Medieval Era, and that armor was nigh invulnerable to most weapons of its time. In the setting of Dune armor should by all rights be far superior to that, and far more comfortable to wear. It seems more plausible that every professional soldier would be outfitted with personal power-armor largely capable of the superhuman feats we read about Leto 2 pulling off in Children of Dune after putting on his sandtrout suit. That's clearly not the story that Herbert wanted to tell, but it still stands to reason that combatants would wear some form of body armor under their shields, except perhaps in the case of a formal dual."

horror,fr0ujbl,t1_fqzwend,1589807071.0,"There was no supernatural monster. The Babadook was a metaphor for the mother's mental illness, and to some degree an expression of that illness. She made the Babadook story book (if you view the movie closely you will see the art supplies she used to construct it), because her grief and depression needed an outlet. Those things drove her to harbor some degree of hatred for her own son, who was a constant reminder of her loss. She wanted to scare him and hurt him because of that resentment, but she still loved him as well. Her emotions were at war inside her, and that is why she is both the protagonist and antagonist of the story. The son ultimately helps her save herself, from herself. She is finally able to accept the world crushing grief for what it is, and find a way to live with it. It's no coincidence that the basement room where she keeps the Babadook locked away is also full of her husbands old possessions. The ending could be interpreted to mean that she chooses to go down there periodically to look through those artifacts of her former life, deliberately invoking both the happy memories and the pain of that loss, and find some catharsis by doing so."

I love [michaelcthulhu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGca03sbLq7OUnXMdvRHyBQ)'s stuff as well, but it's the same sort of thing (fantastical weapon shaped steel sculptures). The stuff that interests me is rooted in history, historically plausible, or fantasy which is both functional and utilizes the same fundamental design principles which drove real-world weapon development.

There would essentially need to be an additional mechanism which functions similarly to one of the structurally sound locking systems found on folding knives, but even more proportionately robust because of the additional mass involved for a sword sized blade. Of course, that is going to necessarily add further complication to the build, and probably inhibit how quickly you can shift between forms."

This is no easy task, because most of the weapons in the game are structurally flawed in their design, scaled too large/heavy to be usable, or both. 

  

If I were to attempt to construct a weapon inspired by the Saw Cleaver, I think I would start with a blade size and shape similar to that of a Chinese dadao. The dadao blade is very cleaver-like, and the hilt is usually long enough to easily allow for two-handed use. The joint is the big obstacle to puzzle out, because that invariably going to be a weak point. Because of the joint's location it would need to be able to endure all the stresses of impacts against a target, yet still able to swiftly engage/disengage to rotate between weapon forms. If I can come up with a decent solution to the joint issue, I'll be sure to post about it here once I've built it."

That would necessarily fold in all of the accumulated stresses of the sword being around that long, and the shock and torsion of this hypothetical immortal continuing to train with it. Also, since all immortals are some degree of master swordsmen, every one of those 25 duels will be a prolonged engagement where not are the blades regularly striking each other, but can also be expected dramatically cut into the local scenery. All of those sparks flying off those swords are tiny pieces of metal. That's mass lost that you can't just superglue back on.
   
A HEMA feder blade is not constructed like a sharp. You cannot expect a sport/training simulator to behave like a weapon built for combat. They have entirely different design parameters. 
  
On a sharp blade, edge to edge contact, will almost always result in significant damage. Even when trying to avoid this kind of contact, it still often happens. Every nick, chip, and edge roll permanently weakens the blade. That's just the obvious damage, those impacts can be creating micro-fractures in the blade. These stress fractures happen in our modern homogeneous steels. One can only imagine how much this kind of invisible damage would have plagued pre-modern alloys. Many Medieval swords are very soft by modern standards (even at the edges), and that may very well have been an effort to avoid battlefield fracturing. I bent sword can be unbent, but a broken sword is just fucked. A downside of having a softer temper is that they are more prone to edge damage, and enough edge damage will inevitably lead to metal fatigue and breakage. 
  
Swords were never the things portrayed in popular media. They were tools that could be expected to wear out and need replacing.

Edit: Cutting tatami, even with a dowel core, is not even remotely like earnest combat. Bone is harder than a cheap Home Depot length of polar, and cutting bone is generally accepted to be abusive testing. Cutting bone is significantly less abusive to a blade than striking metal is, and one could expect to strike metal and/or bone in combat."

Most of the swords that have survived hundreds of years in good condition were never used in combat. Some of them were display pieces for the very wealthy, some were preserved through blind happenstance (i.e. anaerobic environments like bogs or the silt in the bed of a river), while other examples came from armories where there were more weapons available than were ever actually needed for use in combat (and were maintained by the soldiery nonetheless)."

vita,fgm7t1q,t3_eysmnf,1580919587.0,"I have 2 Vita slimes (one is an unopened backup I ordered last year after they announced the hardware was being discontinued), and a PS TV.  I also purchased a couple extra memory cards for them."
books,ffwujkb,t1_ffwstg0,1580311319.0,"That's literally one of the fundamental elements of the novel. Reality is petty, thoughtless, and cruel, but we have the ability to elevate ourselves and each other from that mire of banality."
books,fffxoa8,t1_fffviue,1579894062.0,Mark Twain is a great place to start. His works are very accessible.
SWORDS,ff9boxz,t1_ff8o8al,1579709306.0,The golok is not an African blade.
SWORDS,feo9iie,t3_epvqht,1579296955.0,The Windlass Arbedo has a lot of positive buzz.  Here's a KoA link: http://kultofathena.com/product.asp?item=500090
movies,fee90xi,t3_eok6us,1579028892.0,I think the answer to the story's hypothesis could be easily resolved with a trip to Finland.
SWORDS,fe9c5xk,t3_eo0epm,1578936255.0,"It definitely has a lot of grip real-estate for the proportionate blade length. It's atypical when compared to most historic longswords, but it seems like it should be perfectly functional. I prefer fantasy pieces like this, which don't stray too far from historic examples. A lot of the surviving swords had their form factors refined through generations of combat experience, also I like my tools to look like tools. The only thing I would change on this design, would be to make the quillons terminations less pointy. They are much more likely to poke the wielder in the heat of combat, than an opponent. Well done."
SWORDS,fdqu45g,t1_fdq4lj8,1578674914.0,"Bayonets are irrelevant too. When I was in army basic training the instructors told us that if we ever found ourselves in a combat situation where we were down to using bayonets, that we should make peace with the fact that we were about to die."

television,fcyx6lf,t1_fcyj15i,1578089045.0,Just be sure to get a second opinion before taking that swan dive. Misdiagnosis happens.

Fighters,fcue0y2,t3_eiua5y,1577978744.0,I remember that game. It was pretty technically competent IIRC.

SWORDS,fco70nt,t1_fcmt5as,1577825296.0,It looks like a reflection of the scabbard to me.

SWORDS,fcnl0z1,t3_ei5osh,1577813579.0,"Laws vary by state/country, and I would consider talking to an estate planner if you are wanting to establish some sort of legal trust. Most of the time, once the property passes out of your (or your trust's) possession, it becomes the property of the recipient, and you wouldn't be able to dictate what they did with it from that point onward. Your best course is to make your intentions known to your daughters, and encourage them to pass them along in the manner you have in mind. Alternatively, you could establish a family trust which would monetarily reward a sword owner for passing it along to the next generation, as per your wishes. Again, any legal specifics should involve a legal professional versed in the requirements of where you live."
SWORDS,fckxcgz,t3_ehov1f,1577735212.0,You might be able to get a custom pommel made for something like a Hanwei Tinker 9th Century Viking Sword for considerably less than a complete custom sword.
SWORDS,fcktpjf,t3_ehntqk,1577732976.0,I think your great grandfather might have been Godric Gryffindor.
martialarts,fck4tam,t1_fcjwkrw,1577716608.0,"It's not what I would consider a fetish, but the bruises of a hard sparring session feel as pleasant to me as post work-out muscle soreness. There is a certain satisfaction in that sensation of accomplishment and ordeal. I wouldn't categorize that kind of pain as sexual, but I certainly find the experience to be physically pleasing. That said, it's more about the experience as a whole, and not really the person doing it to me (if that makes any sense). I think it basically boils down to getting punched in the face makes my brain release pleasing neurotransmitters."
SoulCalibur,fc5t2q5,t1_fc5qb0k,1577465250.0,Very nice
scifi,fc5sxw5,t1_fc2m0rg,1577465163.0,"I wish they had the budget to make the Martians and Belters look like they do in the books. Also, Bobby should look like Dwayne Johnson in drag."
scifi,fc5sp02,t1_fc2dh3o,1577465002.0,"I went into Heinlein's Starship Troopers expecting more of a pro-fascist feeling than I found. It's definitely there, but it didn't really come off as the author's outright endorsement to me. I felt it was just part of the dystopian setting being depicted.

I read The Puppet Masters around the same time, and that is a book which hasn't aged well at all. It's a weird mashup of Mad Men misogyny, old time-y white picket fence/Jim Crow nostalgia, and retro-futurism (Rocket cars! Hidden underground bases!! Ray guns!!!)."
SoulCalibur,fc5pkdh,t3_egbxd0,1577463243.0,I think you spelled Setsuka wrong.
PlayStationPlus,fc5gkls,t3_eg4osg,1577456990.0,"I few years back my PSN account got hacked and someone spent 100s of USD on FIFA in-game currency. Fortunately, I didn't have any FIFA games associated with my account, so it was easy for the support team to recognize that it wasn't legitimate activity. It was still a relatively slow process for me to get refunded."
