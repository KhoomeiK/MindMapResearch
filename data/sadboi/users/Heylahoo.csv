So when he decided to cut contact, I was pretty devastated, seeing it as me losing a great friend.

The one friend who took it decently, continued being my friend, and didn't let things get weird or awkward or called me ""cruel"" for not returning his feelings (I'm looking at you, Alan) ended up being my now boyfriend after a few years :) so I guess things worked out in the end.

acting,fjg61ks,t3_fd81l5,1583313166.0,"I'm 26, and have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 21. It was very debilitating at first, being so severe for my age. From this it created depression and high anxiety. It has slowly gotten better, but not quite in remission yet. I take a total of 14 different kinds of medications. My health is my biggest concern.   


There are things you can't control. And that's ok! It took me a bit to accept that this is my condition, it's what I have to an extent. Now, let's focus on things you CAN control around your health issues.  


For your physical problems, if you're able to, see a doctor if you haven't already and stick to the routine he/she recommends. If you're currently under the care of a doctor, address your concerns and see if there are any options that may help ease you. Google online forums and find people who have the same illness, and ask around. Ask, ask, ask, and you never know when the answers you're looking for will pop up!  


Mental health: therapy. I know, I know, I'm sorry if I'm not the first person to suggest this, but please love yourself and your mental health enough to seek a therapist. If you can't go to a therapy in person, there are various online therapy sites! When we're stuck in our own world of illnesses, it's hard to see clearly. Having a professional there to bring you back up to the surface may increase your awareness as well as healthy coping mechanisms!  


What I personally do: the things I can control completely are my diet and health routines. For rheumatoid, I switched over to an extremely healthy, mostly fish and Omega-3 diet with tons of leafy greens. I also gave up everything sugary, and replaced them with fruits instead. I'm not familiar with your limitations due to your stomach problems, but diet can play a huge part in your health. I'm also a tea fanatic. I hope you're able to find something for this!  


For my mental health, I am currently in therapy, but I also try to do a bit more at home. I've been practicing meditating, which isn't as hard or terrible as it sounds. I started off just sitting in my room, focusing on my breathing and set the timer for maybe 5-10 minutes. It helps me be aware and confront negative thoughts but also be able to push those negative thoughts away. I know it's easier said than done, but I really wish I had started meditating years ago. I have also been practicing journalism. Well, more like a small daily to do list to help keep me focused and on track, and by keeping the list short and within my limits, I'm able to feel good about myself for finishing the tasks while also giving me time to recover.  


Overall, I'm sorry to hear this. Having health issues you didn't want nor can control while pursuing acting is tough as charred dinosaur skins. It may help to focus on the things you can do, and for the things that you can't control, ask for help. It's also ok to be honest about your health to others in this field. I know it seems taboo or bad luck and nobody will want to cast you, but it may also bring awareness to people you're working with, and some understanding. You do not have to shoulder this alone, ever. Good luck, I believe in you!"

Veterans,fhx718o,t1_fhx3q9y,1581946664.0,"I guess one of the main thing we combat against when getting out is loneliness. A friend of mine introduced me to The Mission Continues, a volunteer group that's everywhere, and consists of both military and civillians. It's a nice way to start off small, being immersed with people who understand you and people who support you. It's also a nice way to give back to the community and fill a bit of that empty hole inside you after losing your purpose.

Another thing I sort of ""forced"" myself to do is be involved in a local stand up club. I figured it was a way to slowly get all that dark humor out now and then, and it seemed better than a meetup group that focuses solely on getting to know one another, since I have trouble making friends since I got out. It helped, not immensely, but it did, to be able to joke around and just forget the dark scary world if only for a moment. 

The biggest problem, and I cannot stress this enough, was *trying to avoid veteran social groups that were filled with vets who were toxic*. I mean this as in, there are certain groups out there whose sole purpose in life is to put others down, especially civillians whom are viewed as ""beneath"" them. The toxicity of some of these groups are noticeable, but when you're depressed and your eyes are blurred from isolation and your heart is desperately missing that camaraderie, it's hard to see clearly. Please do yourselves a favor and, as much as we all love shit talking one another, avoid those who only do that. It's easy to try to cling onto familiar social settings and people. 

It's hard. It's terribly hard and depressing and lonely sometimes (or more than that). *There are ways to slowly pull yourself out of the hole. You just have to really try to look through the thick fog and find your way.*"

All these foods are healthy for anyone. Try to avoid high cholsterol processed meats, stick to white meats. 

Some cheap options I used to rely on were chicken breasts with frozen veggies (super cheap to have and store), and whole grain oats/lentils/brown rice. I'd bake the chicken/fish, while cooking the frozen veggies in the rice cooker with the rice. Very easy and not too messy, perfect for meal prepping. 

Here's a link with alist of some high protein foods. Remember every ""diet"" has a pros and cons list, you know your body the best. A healthy diet is only half the battle.Regular exercise, even if it's just a few minutes of push ups, situps, or a short cardio workout daily, does wonders.

Edit:

[https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/survival-jobs-3260/](https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/survival-jobs-3260/)

This article is pretty helpful.

Another thing: Rent prices and the economy in general now is a lot harder than it was back then, so find roommates ([Roomster.com](https://Roomster.com) is a good palce to start). If possible, use public transportation, bike, scooter, etc... If you've a car and some down time, Uber might not be a bad idea to do in between survival job and auditions. Cook, try not to eat out, meal prepping is a very healthy and cheap option if you're by yourself.

Have you looked into programming/coding? A very flexible field that can be self taught with a good handful of work from home positions. Other ""jobs"" that can be flexible AND help you out during your acting journey: web development and video editing (edit your own reels!).

Do not think of actnig as a job but rather, opportunities to do what you love. You don't have to give up socializing, instead, socialize with other like minded people. You can attend meetups for filmmakers, actors, writers, etc.... places with people who you can connect with professionally and personally.

Remember, you do need money to survive, but if your survival job takes a toll on you that affects acting, then it might not be worth it. It's on you how much commitment you want to put into acting. Jumping into the fire is a well known thing actors believe they must do. But having a bucket of water or two on standby doesn't mean you're any less committed.

acting,f77px6q,t3_duecor,1573470179.0,"I am a huge introvert, and the thought of networking in this industry scares me. If you love it enough, yes there will be aspects of it that scares you, but it won't stop you. You got this!"
Actingclass,f77mjkd,t3_duhtpi,1573464557.0,"I love reading the comments and critiques! It has made me become a bit more self aware regarding my very beginner acting skills, and most of all, it made me realize that as much as this industry is hard and stressful, it is also filled with supportive, like-minded people. It makes the world feel a tad bit less lonely."

acting,f71vnbb,t3_dtxbij,1573349117.0,"You want to surround yourself with friends who support you, whether they understand it or not. The acting industry is already so stressful, being surrounded by people who won‚Äôt constantly try to drag you down or undermine your career choices  can sometimes be the make or break of a turning point of your career. Good luck!"
bipolar,f6lg9jj,t3_drr06n,1572943227.0,That's gorgeous!
CasualConversation,f60l2s6,t1_f60dxu5,1572619936.0,"I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt understand your question. Who is lying? Ive been under rock, my apologies

Edit: I did a quick google search and holy shizzle. I never really used Facebook as my main source of information/news to begin with but this is just horrendous. The Facebook groups I‚Äôm actively involved in aren‚Äôt there to give facts, but to give support and connections and networking opportunities. Yeah no this is, this is bad."
CasualConversation,f60cvzt,t1_f60cnln,1572613770.0,"Well, I'm not being forced to reactivate facebook, but being on a few selected facebook pages will be very helpful for me: networking with people, as well as having access to resources that may not be on other sites. 
Social media has made the world smaller, which was good in the beginning, but I feel that nowadays, if I'm not a part of it, then I would be ""behind"" on certain things in my field.

Edit: I don't really scroll through it for hours like I used to anymore. I hop on a few minutes each day to read through what I need, then hop off. I'm not about to self destruct by seeing other people's life's highlights and comparing those to my worse days."
CasualConversation,f60cbvv,t3_dq3sms,1572613289.0,"I deactivated my FB account for 2 years now, but reactivated it recently because of a recent change of career, that now requires me to be able to network with people, who most are on faceboko.

I don't like it."

acting,f5rgyyh,t1_f5rej2i,1572394262.0,"You don't have to buy any of her stuff, she has a lot of videos on youtube. There are so much information out there, some good, some bad, but personally I find her videos to be helpful snice I had no idea where to even begin."
acting,f5rbw29,t1_f5r6hjg,1572391703.0,"Thanks for this! And I agree, although as a brand new, know nothing aspiring actor, some of her advice was really good and gave me a bit of confidence to get the wheels rolling"

acting,f5n3269,t3_dodmk6,1572296193.0,"Experience! Do everything, join everything. You don‚Äôt even need to move to LA to gain exposure. Find classes and local theatres to gain experience and build up your confident. Acting classes, professional headshots, and other things can become very expensive, so have money saved up. I suggest watching Wendy Alane Wright‚Äôs YouTube videos. She‚Äôs a Hollywood manager and has amazing advice, tips and tricks for starting actors. Good luck!"

Edit: I really do hope you and that person were ok!"
AskReddit,f5dzoie,t1_f5dyadg,1572162341.0,"I know saying it and doing it are very different. Here‚Äôs one example: I‚Äôm 25. I got out of the Navy a couple of years ago and have spent my life since in and out of the hospital for mental illness. It took all of that for me to realize that although my parents love me to the moon and back, they cannot dictate my happiness. I will take care of them, I will spend time with them. But we don‚Äôt have to accomplish that their way. Two weeks ago, I applied to an acting school in my city. I changed my major from pre med to IT at my uni because it‚Äôs something I enjoy. They do not agree with it. They wont. And that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs ok. You got this. You do. I know you do."
AskReddit,f5dxv9x,t1_f5dx1f8,1572161443.0,You will. It takes a lot of work and therapy and self discovery to break out of that shell that was built around you. It won‚Äôt be easy. But you will. And my dms are always open :)
AskReddit,f5dv4c9,t1_f5dr9re,1572160059.0,My therapist is also Asian so he understands very well. Lots of guilt and self destructive criticisms.
AskReddit,f5dc1bn,t1_f5cqfth,1572151511.0,"Coming from a traditionally strict Asian family, this ruined me as an adult. As a kid, I constantly strives to be better than others. But now, I am worn. I am tired and at the end of the day, I could not give a shit if I‚Äôm driving a used van and the next person is driving a Mercedes. I only want to be happy, whatever that means for me personally."

Today, I'm practicing a monologue to get accepted into KD Acting Studio in Dallas and TBell Acting Stage. I am slightly worried about starting so late, in my mid 20s. I'm scared shitless, but I'm pushing on.  
Once I practice more I'll feel confident to post it here for good feedback!"
acting,f4941hm,t3_djxhvx,1571456376.0,"You don't have to move to LA to attempt that. You can start from where you are, build up a good savings and get more time to plan your move to LA. Remember, a bad decision isn't your goal, it's the planning. Definitely chase after what makes you happy, but don't fly too high to the sun if your wings are only glued to you with wax."
