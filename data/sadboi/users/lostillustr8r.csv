Teachers,fbzdhc7,t3_ef7rzh,1577243069.0,"This scares me. 
I changed my entire direction in life because I‚Äôve felt a desire to teach art. Being adopted, I literally just met my biological grandmother through one of the DNA test sites and found out she has taught art her whole life and her father (my grandfather) was the head of the art department, in 1947, at one of the universities I attended a few years ago. I have one more semester to finish my bachelors at 33 and I‚Äôm hitting all sorts of road blocks and signs that maybe this isn‚Äôt where I should be heading. 
I deal with some shitty anxiety and depression and I hear so many teachers complain that it‚Äôs not worth it. Especially when it comes to compensation. I‚Äôm completely at a loss of what to do when I hear things like this. How can I feel confident to continue forward? I hope you figure this out and it works out for you OP. I wish you the best."

lonely,fb3kr39,t3_cz0piy,1576476602.0,Loneliness sucks. There‚Äôs no getting around it. Especially during a time of year when everyone seems to post about their SO‚Äôs.  You matter though. There‚Äôs something you have that means something in this world. Something that makes a difference. Hang in there. I will too.
lonely,fb3kmrh,t1_fb3ke9r,1576476469.0,"Although I can‚Äôt be physically there, I‚Äôm here for you. The loneliness sucks. Hurts like hell. But somewhere in this world, you got someone who feels what you‚Äôre feeling. Just know you‚Äôre not completely alone."

lonely,fb3bfym,t1_fb3b5e0,1576468716.0,"I miss my ex‚Äôs family a lot this time of year. Occupying time volunteering for others and keeping busy is one of the best ways to keep my mental health on track. I‚Äôve been lucky to pick up some illustration commissioned work myself, which has helped me a lot. Happy holidays and New Years to you! We‚Äôll make 2020 a great one :)"
lonely,fb3ayi2,t1_fb3avw6,1576468385.0,Good way to occupy the time for sure.

Especially when your parents are conservative Mormons and you are a 32 year-old liberal agnostic trying to finish school."
AskReddit,ere7mni,t1_ere2ib7,1560776360.0,"I think most, if not all of us, had that one teacher we can remember that impacted our lives. I‚Äôve been so lucky to have such amazing teachers in my life that saw my potential and taught me more than just the curriculum. I recently gave up a comfortable job and lifestyle to finish school and become an art teacher. It‚Äôs been a lifelong passion of mine."

depression,erdan7i,t1_erd9wtk,1560735970.0,"I know that feeling all too well. 

Before I wrote this post, I had a solid cry on the floor with those thoughts. I got up, ran to 7-Eleven to grab an energy drink, and was met by the cashier, a big friendly Samoan. I asked if he had kids. He said yes. I wished him a happy Father‚Äôs Day, and asked if he was off soon to go enjoy the holiday. He told me his family is living in Samoa still, trying to get them here someday. He said he got to talk to them last night. My heart flooded with sympathy. Suddenly I didn‚Äôt feel so alone going through tough times. I got in my car and cried for this amazing dude, smiling and keeping his chin up. 

This pain is temporary, however long temporary is. Don‚Äôt give up. I have two shoulders for leaning on. As do many others in this sub."
Hyperhidrosis,epyac56,t1_epya0t0,1559625137.0,"Same! I‚Äôd go through so much chalk!

I found an interesting technique that kinda helps: get one of those small travel size tubes and fill it 1/3 with isopropyl alcohol and almost 2/3 with the chalk. It creates a chalky paste that covers your hands. Then when you chalk up, it stays on your hands better. I still sweat through it though and have to reapply a couple times but at least I get to climb occasionally."
Hyperhidrosis,epy2kx6,t3_bwdefh,1559617468.0,"Happens to me all the time! 
I love to rock climb, but even the very thought of it (aaaaand there it goes) makes my hands bead up."

Sorry to disappoint ya Mormons, but in the past few thousand years, science figured out it‚Äôs actually caused by the refraction and dispersion of the sun's light by rain or other water droplets in the atmosphere. Fingers crossed for Jesus next year though! ü§û"
