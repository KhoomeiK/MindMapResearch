You shouldn’t feel good about having to work. It is the most soul crushing, evil, wasteful sin of the current world. 

There is some truth to ‘finding what you love and you’ll never work a day of your life’. If that something is figuring out how to automate all human labor and distribute the wealth then you’re extra cool in my book. 

It sucks, for some reason we’ve mythologized work, lionized it, and convinced ourselves it makes sense. It doesn’t.

complexsystems,faiek3e,t3_e9en79,1576105971.0,"I too am interested in this, and while I apologize for not having an answer, I would like to maybe add to the question. It seems strange to me how parsimony hangs together with complexity in that complexity seems to demand abundance for utility/functionality/a condition for existence. I think of something like Scott Page's work on the necessity of ""diversity"", or George Mobus and Michael Kalton's book on system science which also considers a ""diversity"" of components as a hallmark of complexity. More technically I think of work on robustness and how independent, divergent and different actors in an ecology, or a study, end up yielding stability/success. I am also reminded of Herbert Simon who claimed complex systems were hierarchical, comprised of many pieces.

This all, of course, could mean that there is still a parsimony corresponding to every method/paradigm.  It could be the case that there is an abundance AND an ideal degree of commitments not unnecessarily inflated. The tension is still very much there and confuses me."

Regardless of how my imposter syndrome feels, this is true of every human being. Staying mindful of this neurological fact is one which can curve what is ultimately an unfortunately common and misleading belief: that there is something inherently different about \*me\* which renders \*me\* inadequate and not repetition dependent.

Anxiety can then run with something like ""well then I haven't studied enough! I haven't done enough!"" in which I try to also stay mindful that imposture syndrome is seemingly common and it itself may be evidence of progress as it means I am challenging myself. Only those who do feel imposter syndrome. I've in a weird way started to welcome it, use it as confirmation that I'm on the right tract and it in turn becomes more manageable.

AcademicPhilosophy,eq11ucw,t1_epunqos,1559699323.0,"Funny enough I was just reading ""discovering complexity"" by William Bechtel (a former student of Wimsatt's), who explicitly brings up the necessity of ""independent measurements"" in order to have authentic robustness. Reading thinkers like Wimsatt is a joy, but does have it's difficulty as the picture emerges throughout the reading sometimes in a discontinuous way. It isn't exactly a linear philosophy of science in terms of how we come to know it/grasp it. Things click and we get an idea of how it all hangs together rather than move through it via a procedure, and of course ""the new mechanism"" or whatever would function exactly this way - why would our epistemic habits differ that much from the mechanisms of the world? Robustness would also of course be a determining factor for ontological commitment for me. There being multiple independent traditions all suggesting the existence of something seems to be pretty strong evidence of it's existence. This is certainly epistemic, but at some point seems to oscillate into ontological territory, and as such ""ontic independence"" is a wonderful conception. Thank you for the heads up.   


This ""unrelated chunks of physics"" is a bit bizarre to me, however. I understand your explanation in terms of satellite data, in a sense corrupting various other climate science results with data favoring a particular conclusion, but if we take the thesis ""there are no unrelated chunks of physics"" literally, then wouldn't this ontic issue effectively block robustness all together? Perhaps I should just read the paper you suggested lol"

AcademicPhilosophy,epsi24u,t1_epq48cn,1559449733.0,"I remember discovering ""robustness"" via Wimsatt's collection (re-engineering philosophy for limited beings). That was a few years ago and it has since oriented much of my work and thinking. I'm a philosopher and as such I tend to think of robustness along more epistemological lines. For instance: As far as I can tell, ""robustness"" is the greatest answer to how we arrive at truth, knowledge, there is. This doesn't mean it tells us what truth is (that is still a hugely complex question, if at all answerable) but that multiple paths which converge upon a singular point seems to be the best bet.

I often explain to my friends that the reason why I believe in climate change is not because there is a single study which says ""ITS HAPPENING"" but rather because it shows up in oceanography, meteorology, climatology, agriculture, immigration, ice measurements etc . It is precisely the combination of all of these different disciplines, worldly events, and observations all pointing in the direction of ""uh oh spaghettios"" that has me frightened."
