canadients,fqqp98p,t1_fqqozcj,1589569501.0,Have a look at the veryvell drops rugles. Water soluble nano emulsification. 200x the thc content in one bottle of the drops that is in a Baker street and ginger. They are on the ocs for 65 a bottle. I dont know why no one is talking about them.. you can easily make your own drinks to whatever strength wanted for a fraction of the tweed drink prices..I just ordered a second bottle of the yawn drops myself lol.
canadients,fqqozcj,t1_fqqliq9,1589569362.0,"2 or 3 hours. I was trying to see how hard it could hit if I pounded it into me. I had to pee like a maniac I will get that out of the way lol. I def feel a pleasantness from them but nowhere near a satisfying stone. I think the deep space ones at 10mg would be better for me. 

Yes I do have a pretty high tolerance I consume probably double what you do daily at least. Again overall they were fairly enjoyable I just personally wouldn't buy them at the current strength again. I do agree though the mild pleasant effects you feel from them come on very fast. Before I'm done the second can I can feel it, once again, very mild and pleasant but nowhere near stoned."
canadients,fqql22t,t3_gkblso,1589567388.0,"Bought 8 cans for a laugh..had 3 first night 5 the next. I'd need to drink all 8 to feel more stoned than smoking a bowl. Taste was meh. Wouldn't buy them again. 

Veryvell drops on the other hand I'm liking. Put 30 drops in my water this morning which is 15mg of thc. Hit hard and fast. I think these will be big when people become aware of their existence. They and tweed are the only nano emulsified products I'm aware of so far."
