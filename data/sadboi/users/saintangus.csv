German,fr0yart,t3_glya7u,1589809511.0,"So the trend seems to mostly be ""nothing below B1 matters,"" and they're not wrong in the very literal sense of ""they don't matter in terms of getting into school or a job in Germany,"" but I'll make a slight counterargument addressing the ""is it worth something"" part of your question. 

I think certificates can provide a good benchmark of where your learning is progressing. For me as someone just getting started, as easy as the A1 is, passing it with the score I did gives me a sense of, ""Okay, my listening is on track. I need to get my speaking up by my writing is great,"" etc. Now as I work toward A2 this summer I can finetune my study. Taking the A2 now and doing great on it will tell you, ""Okay, I'm on the road to the B1"" which is the certificate that every other poster is telling you ""actually matters."" But what if you take the A2 and struggle? That will tell you that you need to put in more time before you get to the big boy tests. There's value in that knowledge.

For me, there was also the psychological component of feeling accomplishment. Learning a language is like running a marathon where you don't know how far the finish line is and sometimes you have to run through mud or bee's nests. So having that certificate was a nice reminder that  I'm moving forward even when it often feels I'm not.

Based on your personality and motivational tactics your mileage may vary on my advice, but that's what I used it for."
norsk,fqlnp8j,t3_gjk09q,1589462463.0,"Hi! I'm using Pimsleur for German but I think my comment still applies.

They've been advocating the ""once per day"" model back when it was primarily on CD, so I think the reason is more scientific than cynical. I think it has more to do with not having too much cognitive overload. A Pimsleur lesson is pretty tightly designed, and packs a lot into 30 minutes (although sometimes it doesn't feel like it). If you try to do two in a row, you reach a point where your brain, for lack of a better word, can't process much more. Or at least, not process as well.

Every Pimsleur-like program (Language Transfer, Michel Thomas) also recommends the approach of ""less time each day is better than more time sporadically."" Also, candidly, an hour or more of a Pimsleur would begin to put me in a coma. It's not the most...dynamic way of learning.

If you make Pimsleur a part of your balanced study routine, once per day will be perfect. I hope this helps!"
Bundesliga,fp237c0,t1_fp21cnh,1588254214.0,"There has not been a vaccine developed for this type of virus ever. SARS was in 2003 and there's STILL no vaccine, and MERS was in 2013 with no vaccine. it could very easily be years before one comes along, if one ever does.

Now granted there seems to be far more of a concerted effort this time  to make one, and I hope to God I'm wrong; if I am in one year and we're all walking around vaccinated, come back here downvote me to oblivion and I'll happily take it. But to those saying some equivalent of, ""We really can't do anything until there's a vaccine,"" it's just literally not possible to sustain society with this type of continued lockdown. (Please note this is NOT me saying, ""Open up tomorrow"" or ""Start the Bundesliga next week."" What we are doing right now is painful but necessary, and probably will be necessary for the next several weeks.)

There seems to be a bit of a Reddit bias that ""we just have to hunker down and ride this out for years until there's a vaccine"" not recognizing that (at least where I live in New York City) there are too many people who don't have telecommuting capabilities. The loss of life from domestic abuse and suicide and homelessness and financial ruin will equal if not exceed the virus deaths. It's a brutal choice and balance to make about when to re-open (which is why I'm scared that Donald Fucking Trump is calling the shots where I live) but at some point the epidemiology and the social/financial ramifications are going to have to reach some sort of balance.

Just to be clear: lockdown now and for the foreseeable future is good and necessary. No sports for the medium to even long term is good and necessary. Being under lockdown until a (potentially never arriving vaccine) is simply unsustainable for the lower and middle-lower classes (at least in the United States; Germany may be different and I concede that point)."

German,flm17c9,t1_fllvhtm,1585272216.0,">By restricting myself to only easier books, I would have to wait many months to just start reading the book I really want to read now.

Here's the thing though: using your method you *are* going to have wait many months to read the book you want now. Because if you decide at A1 to read a high fantasy book with complex grammar and syntax, you are, hate to say it, gonna have to look up every other word. And you're gonna have to parse every sentence to figure out why they're using the dative case, etc.

You're going to spend so much time defining and marking up, that even when you get to the end, you really wouldn't have read the book at all; you'd have spent more time in the dictionary than in the world of the book.

>Basically, I am more interested in efficiently processing huge amount of data I need now rather than queuing it up for later.

Here's another fun fact: if you read an A1 graded reader, *you will be efficiently processing huge amounts of data that you can both use now and use later.* Learning a language is a massive cognitive load, and every day, every hour is a  struggle. But when you think about the marvel that is reading a book in a different language, parsing syntax and different grammar and sentence structure, then frankly, if your goal is data processing, you've met it! And unlike looking up every third word in a high fantasy book, you'll actually be more engaged in the material! So read one book. Then read another! Then maybe try to read an A2 book, stretch yourself and see how it goes! Do that a little more.

There's no silver bullet or magic solution. If there were, everyone would speak multiple languages.

To use your computer analogy, what you *want* is the processing power to shoot a rocket into space; what you *have* as an A1 student is a damn abacus.

It's frustrating and humbling, but learn to use the abacus. Over time, with dedication you'll be reading the things you aspire to read."

I didn't really see that mentioned. Think about how you learned your native language: sure, you probably did some grammar drills in school but you mostly (likely) read graded readers and street signs and menus and all the things around you. That's a way to take the vocabulary you've been memorizing and actually apply it. It also gives you perspective on grammar quirks and usage that grammar books just can't convey.

It doesn't sound like in your 3 years you've done anything to achieve goal 1, which is output like a native speaker. You're simply going to have to find someone with whom you can speak. Period.

I do Pimsleur German and the ""homework"" vocab lists tend to be words that are similar sounding, to give you practice on differentiating sounds.

For example, one unit in German had words like ""kleider,"" ""leider,"" ""bleiben,"" ""blieben,"" ""deine,"" etc. Having to repeat a variety of similar sounding words in such a precise way is designed, I think, to give you further exposure in fine tuning your pronunciation."
gaming,f9iltke,t1_f9ik87l,1575340258.0,"No. New York is not like this at all (source: I live there). The whole point of this post is to show that most games portray New York City to look like the thing on the bottom, with nothing but tall buildings everywhere.

In fact, NYC *is* like the top picture, where the tall buildings are concentrated in only one small area (I humbly suggest that it is you, in fact, who zoom in, and notice that the vast majority of tall buildings are located on the tip of Manhattan Island below Central Park, yet games would have you believe that's the whole city). 

So in answer to the statement,""NYC is like 300 squares miles of just blocks upon blocks of very similar looking buildings,"" the answer is ""No, NYC does *not* look like that at all. In fact, most of New York is not high rise at all, and parts of the outer boroughs look like suburbs."""

Imagine that you have a baseball game on right before you fall asleep. And it plays all night as you dream away. When you wake up in the morning, before looking at the box score, can you recite just one of the players who hit a home run? How many pitchers were used? Hell, are you even able to tell something as simple as who won the game??? My guess is no.

As another poster said, one trick is to study just before bed (not as you're falling asleep and tired though) and you can sort of ""process"" the material just as your mind processes the entire day in that weird way sleep does.

Teachers,f1exfs9,t1_f1em60x,1569432451.0,"So I work for the US equivalent of your Reserve Bank of Australia. As part of our community outreach team we have a division called Economic Education; I work for that.

My portfolio is pretty broad. I run an economics competition (think of it as a mock trial but for economic policy); I write lesson plans for teachers to download; I conduct teacher PD workshops; I visit classrooms and lecture on economic policy; I help develop museum exhibits; and even helped write a series of comic books!

It's nice because I get to do many of the cool things that make teaching great, with few of the downsides. Like, I can take my time and write a really meaty compelling lesson because I can take my time and don't have to whip up 4 lessons overnight. I get to go to classrooms and be with kids but I don't have to grade or manage behavior. Those sorts of things.

That's why I'd encourage you to look at cultural institutions as a great place to end up. Many of the large museums have similar types of positions, and you'll get to do all the cool teacher-y stuff you love."
Teachers,f1ejjkl,t1_f1efcxt,1569423678.0,"See my other post. Cultural institutions like museums and science centers frequently need education specialists for programs and to write curriculum.

In terms of where to look, cultural institutions are a good place to start. Museums are always looking for people to deliver educational programming beyond giving tours/being a docent. Your skill in primary education should be an asset, as many museums often cater to elementary school audiences. Plus you would have a good chance at some curriculum development as well, utilizing the museum's assets to create lesson plans. 

Look at some history or art museums or the national aquarium or even a local historical society. I sometimes periodically browse job listings; almost always I find some sort of listing for an ""Education Programs Coordinator"" or ""Museum Outreach Associate"" or something like that."
Teachers,f1bdknj,t3_d8mh1b,1569331818.0,"I taught a number of years ago, before the esports boom. A few students came to me and asked if they could use my room after school to play Smash Bros (I think at the time we were on Brawl). I guess they knew that I was a bit of a nerd and would be receptive to the idea. Plus I had a Smartboard :-)

The club largely ran itself; after school on Thursday the students would gather in my room and hook their Wii up to the Promethean Smartboard in my room (I kept the Wii for them locked in a file cabinet, so there was a slight bit of risk involved in running this in the event it was stolen. But I didn't want them lugging it around either.) I pretty much just sat there and watched them play while grading. Mostly I just monitored for any bullying or toxic/inappropriate language, and they almost always kept it clean anyway. So it was very chill.

Once per quarter we had a big Smash tournament. I was able to procure the giant screen in the cafeteria and we hooked the Wii up to the projector and ran a tournament; had over 50 students come that afternoon. We ordered pizza and it was a good time.

The administration gave me no issues. Sometimes the assistant principal would be doing his typical afternoon hall sweep and stop by for a few minutes. I never registered it as a formal, ""school sponsored"" club but no one really seemed to care.

I think your barrier to entry is definitely going to be the games; if you want them playing anything other than something E rated in the school, I can understand why the administration may be hesitant. In an era of school violence, there's a big perception difference between Jigglypuff fighting a Piranha Plant than there is of students sniping each other with guns."

However, the tedium would inevitably set in and I've never beaten it. This year I've dedicated myself to eliminating my video game backlog, and while I never really considered Rampage to be part of that, given that I've owned it for 30 years(!!!) and haven't beaten it suggests that it's time."
