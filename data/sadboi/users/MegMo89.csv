BreakUps,f15vymf,t3_d7ubbq,1569197277.0,Thank you. I needed these words tonight.
Anxiety,eu6c7vb,t3_ceu91n,1563496955.0,I am such a people pleaser that I say “sorry” all the time. It’s like a crutch. I wasn’t aware that I did it so much until my ex pointed it out. And while him and I were together I became more aware to catch it. After we broke up it has seemed to creep back in and I am back at it.
