SuicideWatch,fmc5u1g,t3_fbh4s3,1585939458.0,"l agree with this. Guilt tripping is not helping, its making things worse. Living is an effort for me and I have constant suicidal thoughts, then people telling ""Everyone will be sad when you're gone"" in my face pissing me off because they don't know what I am going through just to live ðŸ˜‚ and they were nowhere to be found when I needed them the most ðŸ˜‚"

How I wish I can end my life but I'm a coward to commit suicide and also don't want to hurt my family. It's painful to live but I have no choice but to live. How I wish I die or be killed..."

And I agree na ang hirap talaga labanan yung stigma, lalo na sa mga old-fashioned, conservative people. Yung tipong ayaw nila paniwalaan yung mga sinasabi mo kasi pang-maarte, pang-mayaman, pagpapapansin, mahina ang loob, walang tiwala sa diyos. Yung you wanted to talk to someone pero walang gustong makinig sa'yo.."

They already looked disgusted when they accidentally saw my past self harm scars, so talking to a friend is not an option.

As for relatives, they already scolded me for self harming, and calling me a shame for the family so, they're also not an option..."

socialanxiety,ewa4lso,t3_bj4zeq,1565236481.0,"Just saw yout post and I totally relate to you. My anxiety worsens because of my work. Whenever I ask question, nor made a weird movement or remarks (I'm a bit of a nerd tbh), they always makes fun of me. Now, I really don't talk when its unnecessary, almost avoiding talks whenever I can.

Now, I made a mess in my work and now, whenever I see someone whispering or looking in my direction, my anxiety risens.

What I do is, I lock myself in the bathroom cubicle, take deep breath and stay inside for 1 or 2 mins.

Or if the  feeling of anxiety id unbearable, I file a leave for the next day, just to get a breather.

Idk if it will work in your case, but sometimes, taking a breather is better than bottling it up, then mess your work afterwards."
