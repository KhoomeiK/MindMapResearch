intermittentfasting,fes96ww,t3_em7000,1579362784.0,"Dude you look amazing! I have a question if you don't mind. Did you have any loose skin after getting to this point? If you did, did you get rid of it somehow? Loose skin is something I'm really worried about."
narcissisticparents,fcqhlbj,t1_fcn88ry,1577886127.0,No worries about the delay. These are actually really good ideas. Sometimes it's crazy how the solution is the simplest one. I don't know if I can ever truly go NC but I can do my best to work towards it. Honestly for all her issues I don't think I can abandon my mom. I just hope I find a way to do it without my own life getting worse. I haven't figured that out yet. Thank you again for being so supportive and answering my questions. I really appreciate it :)
narcissisticparents,fck62jj,t1_fcfalpu,1577717621.0,"Thank you so so much for this. You have no idea how much it helps to get this kind of support. I had a really bad argument with my mom yesterday. Our discussions have become soulless and she doesn't want to discuss my mental health issues the same way she used to. She gets angry and tries to blame me for putting even more pressure on her. I hate myself for this but I defaulted to a child like state and basically begged her to forgive me just so that things could be normal again. I really thought I might lose her with some of the stuff she was saying. 

I'm really angry and I hate compromising myself like this but I did it because I know that if my relationship with her isn't normal then I start to get more and more depressed. I'm trying to overcome that and sever the connection because I feel like it's doing me more harm than good. I realise that I can't have the same kind of relationship anymore. Its become a small talk with some real life future goals discussions type of relationship. I don't know why or how it got to this point but the root is essentially that she has had to go her whole life listening to my Ndad's unending and imagined problems as well as my problems with my depression, etc. I only had to hear her problems but not my dad's. So part of me is angry and feels it's unfair but the other part of me understands why she's like this. 

I am pursuing the Uni as hard as possible and I hope I get it. I want to get out there on my own, I want to be independent, work on myself and my hobbies, learn new things, maybe even get a girlfriend. I just want a real life and make meaningful relationships that aren't tainted with toxicity. So I'll keep trying and do my best.

Thank you again so much for your kind words. Before you went NC with your parents, did you have any ways to stop yourself from getting angry or removing yourself from the situation without escalating it or compromising yourself? I would really like to know so I can try them too. Thanks."
depression,fcar12p,t3_egrb98,1577574900.0,"I have only recently realised just how important human touch is for us. And us guys suffer from an egregious lack of it just cos of the way society normally expects us to behave. 

Recently I even lost out on the one semi availability of touch - a hug from some of my family members. 

Now without even that I am starved for love. I'm completely alone and depressed and while I have normally never felt this way before, part of me wants so badly to feel some kind of love again, that I actually wish I had a girlfriend or something. Lol I know it's kinda pathetic but honestly it's how I feel and I don't have the strength to really process it rn."
narcissisticparents,fcapkab,t1_fcak05x,1577574019.0,"I sometimes think I can manage but honestly despite everything I still love my mother and worry about her. Plus my little brother still lives with them and I can't bear the thought of not contacting him. 

My mom is so condescending and it hurts that before she was my confidante and now I'm alone in dealing with all these fucked up feelings that my parents essentially cursed me with. I have no idea how to process or get rid of them."

depression,f1xhzxu,t1_f1wwxc9,1569798614.0,Take the good parts of his advice but don't follow his MGTOW ideology. Plenty of fish in the sea. For now take your time to heal and get better. Enjoy life. I know it's hard when we're fucked with depression every day but you just gotta take it one at a time. Be happy she revealed herself before your whole life was wasted with her.
depression,f1mf6s2,t1_f1lwymr,1569592506.0,It's not pathetic at all dude. But yeah. The more years go on the less you care. The people around me think it's just natural to feel that way but it's not really. It's a true loss of soul imo. A part of it anyway.
