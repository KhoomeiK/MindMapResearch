depressed,fi56sqm,t3_f6igto,1582156211.0,"Exercise doesn't have to be something huge. It can be something like a 10-15min walk in the evening or late day when there aren't as many people outside. It can be a couple of stretches in bed when you just cannot. It can be anything small to require moving your body if you put some time into it is something I've started to see it as. 

Much easier said than done, as I get it, I come back and lie in bed or on days where I don't have work obligations, I just spend most of the day in bed. But it's kind of helped me to see it from that 'smaller' perspective, so idk I hope it's somewhat helpful for you. :') 

And oh god, I totally get it with the anger. I'm just so irritated over the smallest things or over nothing but it's so tiring as well as the sadness. So isolating too. Keep going mdude."

One of the reasons why I just don't really drink anymore is because I feel like I'm drunk anyway (or at least the whole distorted concept of time, bad memory, bad awareness of everything especially when it's bad) so there's not really any point. 

Weed is a whole other story, I can feel it's effect but it doesn't really change much and makes me feel more spacey for a while after."
