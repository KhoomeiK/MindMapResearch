I see my dietician for my eating disorder which I also work on w my therapist. My dietician, lately, texts me daily about the puppy she’s getting. That by the way, I found the breeder for her. She also asked if I could start sending her daily food logs instead of going through them weekly. So I did, I would get a one word response to them and then she’d just start talking about the puppy or Covid concerns. I eventually just stopped sending the food logs, and no shocker she hasn’t rly asked. Funnily enough too, after not hearing from her for almost a week she texted me on her bday (which was on a Sunday) asking how I was doing, and I believe it was just a ploy to get me to say happy birthday because once I did she didn’t text me anymore ;) there’s plenty more and always has been but I’ll be here for 3 days if I wrote it all out. 

I want to tell my therapist about the dynamic between my dietician and I but I think it’ll get back and I just feel uncomfortable telling her which is why I told my psych a bit of it.

fuckeatingdisorders,fe74sk3,t1_fe29yeb,1578910011.0,That was kind of why I posted this. Just trying to figure out when one decides the level of care they’re receiving isn’t enough and moves on to the next step. I don’t know I need IP but idk I feel like what I’m doing isn’t working
fuckeatingdisorders,fe24oi2,t1_fe1sj41,1578834403.0,"I agree with you, I need to try harder. BUT I’m having so much trouble with it. It feels impossible to make myself sit down and eat at a minimum 3 meals a day. I just can’t do it. I can maybe do two, one being like an “actual” meal and be able to sit with that. I just cannot force myself to have 3 actual meals. 

It’s just so hard being left to my own devises and I just don’t know what else to do. I have been trying but the urges get too strong and too loud and I can’t avoid them."
bipolar,fdlomn2,t1_fdlg6iq,1578528805.0,I wish it would make me restless tbh lol but I’m always restless so this is something I’m just sooooo not used to! I hate it
EDAnonymous,fdennb0,t1_fdendi7,1578342826.0,"My dietitian gave me a green light to text the psych abt not taking it so I did... I can’t risk it. My ED is such a pain in the ass if I gain a ton of weight I would likely end up doing something I couldn’t take back. 

I’m really sorry that happened, it sucks so bad that these drugs that can help with our mind can hurt our bodies. People without ED’s don’t seem to understand how hard this especially is. Like a normal person may be willing to deal with the gain if their mind felt that much better but there’s no way I would ever be comfortable with it. I’m much happier in crazy town to be honest. I hope you’re able to get off of them!!"
EDAnonymous,fdeflbh,t1_fdd6e33,1578337955.0,"Yeah I can’t take it... I also posted in the bipolar sub and was getting a lot of the same feedback. I thought maybe it would effect ED sufferers differently but unfortunately that doesn’t seem to be the case. 

I alrdy texting me dietitian that I’m not going to be taking it. I’ll fill my therapist in tmrw and well as canceling psych going forward.

I’m so sorry that happened to you, I cannot imagine how hard it would be in general but nvm when you’re alrdy suffering from an ED."
