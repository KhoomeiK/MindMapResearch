Script bomb - so far a cheap aggro draw, but I don't think it's that good. Clearly better than it used to be.

Tomb - Disagree, but I get the reasoning. I'm just kinda bored of tomb decks. 

Chessboard - makes sense, but I don't like the idea of activating chessboard from chessboards. 

Ponman statue - These effects are pretty impactful, will wait to see how this pans out.

Script bomb - Looks to have use as aggro draw, but it's 2 more g to get an extra draw on a non selective investment so I think it's pretty weak

Thrashing machine - thanks for this change, I really enjoyed playing collection before and it will be playable again.

GF changes - I think it's still reasonably strong, but less snowbally and less strong.

Lesser dog - This nerf imo is more minor than most think and it'll remain really strong. 

Punishment - outclasses blitz quiz a lot, would like something interesting with that

Scepter - doesn't seem that good, but 30 activations in a match is always super fun. Will play this a ton completely non seriously

Bomb tribe removal - bomb is now not playable in connection :/ but the tribe was entirely useless outside of that bc big bomb was terrible in collection and script bomb was its own tier of useless.


Small changelist, but one I think will accomplish what last patch was meant to.

Self silence decks have been pretty common in some metas, and sometimes have been the highest usage archetype. They're pretty linear and boring to fight against though, so I don't want them to be good (and don't agree with self silence anyway as it restricts design of negative effects)

> or be played too much (just like the multi shot before his rework with papyrus statue)

Multishot wasn't played much at the top before the rework, and papyrus statue was only played in loren otk decks at the time it got changed. 

> I would like to see this more to improve the consistency of the game 

This would make the game more volatile if there's more potential value that's reliant on combos.

> most of the cards are currently made to be just balanced

I disagree with that point, given the fact that there's just been an entire 2 tribes added based on synergising with each other, and the majority of cards in the game still have other cards they work better with."
UnderCards,fqi688d,t1_fqhkcgt,1589391012.0,"You can't get board against it, and if the deck isn't extremely reactive, it can snowball the board with heal and buff in a single card to remove any counterplay that doesn't involve instant damage.

Bench isn't great, whimsalot is unlikely to be big in the late game as the frogs are more expensive at that point, and coffee man isn't the best silence for so when penetration exists, scarf mouse exists, and dark ponman exists. 

You need a bit more draw imo, acceleration if you really want to use seam, but clover works quite well. Overheat is a good card to have as a clear."
