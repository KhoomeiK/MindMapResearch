selfharm,fei1e18,t3_ep8orm,1579128165.0,was the wound clean? how deep was it? super glue may irritate it and isn't advisable to use on deep or unclean wounds because it can trap contaminants in the wound and cause irritation if used internally. super glue isn't the same as surgical glue used in a medical setting. medical grade glue should still only hold the wound together externally: it shouldn't be applied to the internal portion of the wound because it will prevent tissue repair and will eventually be broken down and absorbed into the body.
selfharm,fei17sv,t1_fehtsjh,1579128062.0,"they use surgical glue which is less toxic/irritating and more flexible. dermabond surgical glue is octyl cyanoacrylate and most consumer super glues are ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate. similar but the ethyl variety is more toxic and rigid. 

""Off-the-shelf consumer glues are unsuitable for medical applications, as they are not medical-grade, which means their solvent and cyanoacrylate formulations have not been evaluated and optimized to reduce toxicity and prevent foreign body reactions, as would be the case with medical cyanoacrylates"" (wikipedia page on ethyl cyanoacrylate)"

OP should definitely look into it and consider CBT/ERP to learn how to manage it. it can be debilitating... it feels like mental torture sometimes and it gets exhausting. with therapy they can learn to be ok with not performing the compulsive behaviors. i've been in therapy for over ten years and i can't imagine how much worse it would be if i hadn't, although it's still tough.

from sidebar wiki:

Keep constant pressure on your cut until it stops bleeding.

Use clean water to remove all the blood.

Use of alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to disinfect a wound should be careful and restrained.

If you wash with soap and water, don't use much soap; try not to use scented soap.

Deeper cuts may require butterfly bandages to facilitate wound closure (see Deep Wound section)

Put gauze or an adhesive bandage over your cut. Keep it clean and protected from contaminants.

Once the wound has scabbed over, you can keep it exposed. But it's wise to apply antibiotic ointment at least daily, until the wound has fully healed.

Daily showering will keep your wounds cleaner and speed up the healing process.

Antibiotic ointment, or antibiotic ointment with pain relief, should be used in moderation: no more than 2-3 times daily.

Do not pick at the scabs: this increases your risk of infection."

i'm glad i quit because now I'm no longer dependent on psychoactive substances to get through the day. it feels freeing, but also scary. the tree would make me paranoid and sometimes more anxious than before. i just decided it wasn't worth it anymore. i wasn't able to restrain myself and only use a little. it would get out of hand quick and i'd always end up being high from the moment i got up until i went to sleep. i got tired of such a persistent alteration of my perception of reality, and i think it was bad for my mental health. that, and i was spending a lot of money on drugs. 

the kratom helped a lot but i was worse off if i didn't take it. i felt like i couldn't leave my house without taking it, which wasn't healthy. it also affected my weight by suppressing my appetite, which was dangerous for me because of already dysfunctional eating (or lack thereof) habits."
aspergers,fcvmv8d,t1_fcvhivc,1578005514.0,"i used to smoke marijuana heavily and also used kratom heavily. be careful because kratom can be very addictive if you use it to cope with anxiety. don't let the relatively high dose required for the effects fool you- the active constituents are just as powerful as certain classic opiates when isolated. i went from using a small amount weekly to over 20g per day. was a pain to [quit](http://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom). that being said in moderation it can be a powerful tool. the strains are largely an advertising ploy & placebo effect imo. they are frequently mislabled to sell for more money. there are different strains which have subtle differences in effects, but it's unlikely that the strain it is advertised as is accurate. potency has more to do with growing conditions and drying process. 

i had to quit smoking about half a year ago and now that i'm not using it i can tell how much it helped. i'm much more anxious every day. i used it daily for about 5 years. even though it's not physically addictive, it was difficult to quit. but i'm glad i did.

chemistry,fcnyxbu,t1_fcn41fb,1577821108.0,glass is more heavily regulated than firearms in Texas. what a shame. papa Shulgin would disapprove.
ExplosionsAndFire,fcntv5c,t3_ei66ki,1577818309.0,"i don't intend to be a dick but that guy sounds like a moron. he was probably  out of his depth and didn't take proper safety precautions. it sucks that he got injured but he shouldn't have been playing with explosives in the first place without knowing what he was doing. he is lucky he didn't end up killing someone, including himself. i hope this doesn't lead to stricter legislation for home chemistry. i hope he recovers well."

chemistry,fcm9373,t3_ehxz51,1577767537.0,glad to hear. doesn't affect me but i've always thought that policy was ridiculous and backwards.
selfharm,fcm8f7v,t3_ehwwoh,1577766997.0,"i can relate. when i was at my worst it was absurd but felt so right. my idea of a good night was cutting myself a whole lot, going to get staples, not having to go inpatient, and going home to cut afterwards. 

i don't think you're a psycho though. the human brain is very adaptive. extreme situations can become normalized for better or worse. it's hard to de-normalize a reinforced habit but it is possible with enough time and effort even if it feels impossible. 

please stay safe and make sure to take care of your wounds."
