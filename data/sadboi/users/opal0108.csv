AmItheAsshole,ev61v50,t1_ev60g1w,1564241500.0,"I would agree if these were the circumstances, but I already do most of the care for her. I probably walk her  70% of the time, and I’m already the one that feeds her. The reason I’ve thought that training wouldn’t do much is because she already knows what “sit” “stay” and all that means, she just only listens when it’s him. 
You’re probably right tho, I should at least talk to a trainer and see what their thoughts are."
