You don‚Äôt have to talk about anything you don‚Äôt want to but they will encourage you to. Obviously right now isn‚Äôt the best time to seek therapy because everything is online right now

This sub is really supportive if you ever have anything specific you want advice on. Plus my messages are open if you want to talk about it a bit more. I know how it is to be a people pleaser to the point that acting fine in front of people is a reflex at this point. Have you thought about therapy by any chance?

Suicidal_Thoughts,fmsdcq1,t3_fx0v8n,1586353043.0,"Passive suicidal ideation is VERY common. Maybe this link can help you understand it more and maybe you could send it to your therapist.

MadeOfStyrofoam,flrace8,t3_fqdom3,1585416203.0,Part of a therapists job is to look at different things with you and decide what works best. Snapping a band works for some people and doesn‚Äôt for others. Plus not to mention that while it‚Äôs a pretty common alternative some people may not know about it. I try to think of those situations like figuring out meds. They can all be used to treat the same thing but one med that might work for someone else might not work for you. :)
