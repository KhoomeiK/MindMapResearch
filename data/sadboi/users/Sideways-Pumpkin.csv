Oh and they made us write down triggers, coping mechanisms etc. I put “moana” as my trigger bc my boyfriend (now but not at the time) and I always listened to the music as a joke. They put moana on for the 3rd time 20 minutes later"

selfharm,fqw0gf2,t1_fqv7mje,1589689502.0,I agree. I completely got rid of the person that told my parents. She was trying to help but made it worse since I wasn’t able to tell them in my own time

Witch,fouhw9u,t3_g9n961,1588084366.0,I’m not sure if there is. If there was it could mean you have a negative energy in your home that needs to be cleansed. Are you a rescue/rehabber Or are these just animals you found?

And one has a “tower of power” that has a place for my scale, glove, camera, and a heater. One mew currently has bars and the one with the power has plugs for cold nights.

Oh and both chambers are 10x8 and open up into a weathering yard"
Falconry,fon6dg3,t3_g51fi3,1587913218.0,In the uk birds are manned and weathered by the ferret cages to get them used to the ferrets. Kind of like manning birds around small dogs. A decent amount eventually get the idea that they aren’t prey. I knew a guy who flew an eagle with a mini dachshund. It’s all about getting them used to each other. That being said it doesn’t always work with every bird.
Falconry,fon5uo6,t3_g6sany,1587912896.0,I’ve heard of a few that have been imprinted. They either get an amazingly sweet bird or a demon from hell. I prefer wild caught / parent raised. I’d rather have a happy medium

selfharm,fnlfurm,t1_fnl6jjx,1587052818.0,I hated talking to my therapist anytime it’s not a normal conversation. To get over that I started texting her about it and then we’d talk about it later. You don’t have to talk about anything you don’t want to but they will encourage you to. Obviously right now isn’t the best time to seek therapy because everything is online right now
selfharm,fnl2u9q,t3_g2ac75,1587045850.0,I’m sorry you had to go through that but typing it out and talking about it is a really big step and it’s a good thing. This sub is really supportive if you ever have anything specific you want advice on. Plus my messages are open if you want to talk about it a bit more. I know how it is to be a people pleaser to the point that acting fine in front of people is a reflex at this point. Have you thought about therapy by any chance?
JUSTNOMIL,fnjjnhs,t1_fnjg1jy,1587000362.0,I though the same but it’s hard to see exactly how it would look like especially when it’s not on someone. I can almost* picture it on someone but not quite. But as long as it’s what she likes then who cares :) just because it’s not a style I like doesn’t mean it won’t look great on her
SelfHarmScars,fnddw87,t1_fnd0s9a,1586867535.0,Probably doesn’t help that underage people join those more NSFW subs because it’s “qUiRkY” and leave themselves open to perv messages.

I was just being super lazy to the point where getting up and putting the energy into it was unappealing. Now I can usually go a few months before the urges get me
Suicidal_Thoughts,fmsdcq1,t3_fx0v8n,1586353043.0,"Passive suicidal ideation is VERY common. Maybe this link can help you understand it more and maybe you could send it to your therapist. It even has a little comic/chart and you could tell him what level you’re at it might help to also tell him the highest level you felt, the lowest level you’ve felt, and your current level. It might help with better understanding. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.supportiv.com/depression/passive-suicidal-ideation%3famp"

selfharm,fmlawqs,t1_fml6ldt,1586182665.0,The first time he found out I did (5 years ago) it was completely different. He guilted me and I had some resentment towards him. We got over it now. I’ve talked to my therapist and at this point it’s more behavioral then depression related because my meds are working. I’d honestly just prefer to not talk about it at all

selfharm,fmabyls,t3_ftr3ko,1585889338.0,I fucking hate that argument with a passion. It’s not like I do it because it’s fun and now I have to worry about how my actions affect someone else? All it does is lead me to be more secretive and not trust you enough to tell you anymore. I’m sorry you’re having to go through that. It’s extremely manipulative and not good. If you ever need to talk you can pm me :)

However I don’t feel like you should leave her high and dry and practically ghost her. You need to take your time and find out a response. The problem at hand, how it makes you feel, her blatant disregard for how it makes your feel, your therapists views, and how this isn’t something that you’ll be able to just deal with for the next however long.

SelfHarmScars,fm6hkct,t1_fm5rt65,1585794213.0,Not sure if you want a full coverage/have an idea already or not but maybe have a line through “nothing” and in a font you like have “everything I need” beneath it. Just a thought :)
witchcraft,fm5oe0n,t3_ft5178,1585776783.0,You may look into a pendulum and see about asking it questions and even talking to it about setting boundaries if you’re afraid of it. I talk to mine every now and then. If you think it might help to know what it’s there for you could try a tarot card reading about personality/what it’s there to help you with.

depression,flznmjr,t3_fs1lr3,1585628223.0,Your problems are definitely worth it and even people who don’t have mental illnesses still go to therapy. Therapy is a great tool for mental health and anyone can go. You don’t have to have anything “wrong” to go
Suicidal_Thoughts,flzn2o1,t3_fs5pmu,1585627802.0,There’s other reasons to keep on going. Kids say stuff they don’t truly mean all the time. I’ve regrettably told my mom I hate her but I don’t. I’m not sure how old she is but kids say things and if she’s old enough to remember the conversation she’s old enough to question herself if that’s the reason why it happened. It’s not worth it and there’s so much to live for
selfharm,flzm3d4,t1_flzjcrb,1585627061.0,Taking away blades is a hard thing and tends to lead to the person hiding it more then they already do instead of embracing the problem they hide it away. I can see where OPs mom is coming from
MadeOfStyrofoam,flzkupt,t3_fs23nc,1585626142.0,My experience wasn’t too bad. It just gets pretty boring but you don’t have any expectations so that part is nice. Also if you’re not on meds and you think that could help they’ll talk to you about them and see if you would do better on them. Personally I know I have

Wiccan,flylfau,t3_frxiqp,1585604349.0,I just recently started too. I think spirit guides are helpful and don’t have plans to add anything besides those in my life. Using my pendulum I’ve concluded that I have 2 spirit guides and I’ll be doing a tarot card drawing/reading to determine their personalities
MadeOfStyrofoam,flyk9qf,t1_flyk1m6,1585603730.0,Probably not then. Fortunately when you’re able to drive getting appointments is 100x easier because you don’t have to wait on your parents. I’m not a therapist by any means but if you ever need to talk then feel free to message me

MadeOfStyrofoam,flxqp55,t1_flxpkti,1585588020.0,Have you thought about doing therapy online? If that’s something you’re interested in and you actually want to go to therapy it’s not a bad idea

MadeOfStyrofoam,flxh0du,t1_flxgqk8,1585582721.0,I had a session Wednesday and told her I relapsed on my birthday. I had been avoiding sessions though so now she won’t even let me go a week in between. My main concern is her telling my parents bc legally she’d have to or even getting sent back to a mental hospital. I do have instructions on how to take care of all my animals if that happens though so we’ll see what happens.
selfharm,flxejjn,t3_frk3r8,1585581306.0,Be prepared to answer questions like “why” or “is it something we did” etc. Make sure you have answers to possible questions and you can address them :) this is an amazing step forward and I’m proud of you

The best thing I’ve ever made were blueberry cookies from scratch and they were very labor intensive but that could just be because I made a lot

I haven’t given into the urge to do it on my arms but my thighs..
selfharm,flu4jqv,t1_fltod43,1585495058.0,I’m guessing money might be tight but have you considered selling what you bake? I know people in my community are supporting people that way. My mom is buying bread like CRAZY

MadeOfStyrofoam,flrace8,t3_fqdom3,1585416203.0,Part of a therapists job is to look at different things with you and decide what works best. Snapping a band works for some people and doesn’t for others. Plus not to mention that while it’s a pretty common alternative some people may not know about it. I try to think of those situations like figuring out meds. They can all be used to treat the same thing but one med that might work for someone else might not work for you. :)
