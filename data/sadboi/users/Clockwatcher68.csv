AskTechnology,fq9vtag,t1_fq1jlbl,1589208044.0,HP is bad?  What brands do you recommend?
AskTechnology,fq9vrc0,t1_fpwmqkp,1589208014.0,Thank you.  I will take you up on that.  :)
AskTechnology,fq9vokq,t1_fpx7yd7,1589207971.0,That's an interesting point.  Are there compatibility issues when a lot of the world is using Microsoft?
AskTechnology,fpwm6u7,t1_fpwgpso,1588965910.0,"Thanks for all the great information!  With a file server, will files be saved to both the server and the cloud or just one?  There are around 25 users.  We do have  times of internet outages, which initially caused me to be resistant to a web-based platform."
aww,fker67n,t1_fkdfwut,1584118969.0,I can read stories like this all day.
introvert,fkeqv44,t1_fkelir4,1584118790.0,"I need to try this one.  I'm kind of anxious socially and also soft spoken, so I get interrupted a lot.  My typical response is to let them finish.  Then I say, ""Anyway,"" and continue with what I was saying.  I think people get the hint, but your way is probably more direct."
aww,fkc22fj,t3_fhi6sy,1584044274.0,How do I get a ticket for this group snuggle?
depression,fk8rttm,t3_fh0yok,1583961705.0,Because you're depressed.  Have you ever sought counseling?
introvert,fk21mg3,t3_fg1qe8,1583791229.0,"Very true!  My ex is a total extrovert who can't be alone for five minutes.  As a result, he's perpetually broke.  I haven't gone out in six months.  He thinks I'm a freak."
depression,fjny6d4,t1_fjnaqnm,1583516696.0,I absolutely agree with this!
depression,fjlgoot,t3_fe1gly,1583446297.0,"Unfortunately, some of us require medication forever.  Period.  Because I've been on meds for decades, it's just part of my daily routine.  If someone needs medication for a physical ailment, we don't bat an eye.  However, others need it long enough to get over a big bump in the road.  It can be a scary experience in the beginning, but it has the potential to make life much easier."
depression,fjldkez,t3_fdx6qy,1583444783.0,"I think you've done very well for yourself and should be proud of your accomplishments.  Too late to chase your dreams?  No way.  If you don't try, you may regret it in 20 years.  My sister left a very highly paid legal career at age 50 to go back to school and become a private school teacher.  Low pay and no benefits, but she's never looked back.  You can do it."
depression,fjlch9z,t3_fdvz9t,1583444178.0,"I'm so sorry you're struggling.  The days of depression are long and lonely indeed.  Lots of people do care, even though it doesn't feel that way."
depression,fjlarss,t3_fe1r8v,1583443222.0,"It's dreadful putting a beloved pet down....I've been through it twice.  I keep their ashes on my bookcase and my happy memories with them in my heart.  Eventually, I rescued three more, who also melt my heart.  

Unfortunately, it's up to us to make sure they don't suffer.  Best wishes."
depression,fjl9qv1,t3_fe1r3u,1583442653.0,"Congratulations!  I understand your fear about tomorrow, but am happy you're moving forward today.  :)"
depression,fjl6b2f,t3_fdv1qg,1583440759.0,"I've been in and out of therapy for 35 years.  Some therapists were a complete waste of money, while others were helpful.  I think the most useful therapeutic environments are those where the therapist and the client draw up treatment goals.  It gives you something concrete as opposed to just talking about how life sucks for 50 minutes.  In addition, you can work on specific tools to meet your goals.  That being said, I think the work you are undertaking on your own is fantastic.  My current therapist often reminds me that the way we talk to ourselves has an immense effect on how we feel.  Best wishes to you."
depression,fjku3ga,t3_fduopy,1583433923.0,"I agree with the others.  You view yourself as ugly and it's destroying your self confidence.  I think it's possible that you are transferring your feelings onto them and misinterpreting their responses to you.  Or it's possible that your lack of self confidence does affect the way they see you.  A friend of mine, who would be considered quite unattractive by strangers, has never had difficulty in dating (and marrying) really great women.  He's confident, easy to be around, and funny.  As corny as it sounds, focus on your positives.  The kind of person you want will find you attractive."
TrueCrimeGarage,fivdch7,t1_fi8p7an,1582758315.0,"When I was in high school (mid-1980's) private psychiatric hospitals were often used by affluent parents who couldn't control their kids' behavior.  At that time, many insurance companies would pay for up to three months of inpatient services.  I knew a guy at the time who was put away because his parents were trying to split up the guy (who was 15) and his 19 year old baby momma."
depression,fivcc6g,t1_fiuuya9,1582757808.0,I agree 1000%
depression,fi4xc34,t3_f6bbws,1582150341.0,"I'm so glad that you were able to open up to your friends and that they were supportive!  As you stated, this goes a long way when days are dark."
ITCareerQuestions,fi1seji,t1_fi0zb71,1582063844.0,Thanks so much for your input and the information.  I will look into this.
ITCareerQuestions,fi1fou5,t1_fi0xsfi,1582056830.0,I've wondered about that.......
ITCareerQuestions,fi10m4l,t1_fi0wjxo,1582048325.0,Great suggestion.  Any thoughts on how I would move into this?
ITCareerQuestions,fi0xqe2,t1_fi0wcsy,1582046836.0,I've never thought about that.  What type of skills/certifications would I need for such a position?
depression,fg0z2yn,t3_evuhqi,1580417828.0,"I really hope you're still out there.  I am in extended bout myself, and it's awful.  It's a pain that's emotional, physical and spiritual.  It's frustrating that others around you don't get it at all.  It's frustrating that expensive medication and therapy aren't helping.  It's frustrating that in the midst of your gut-wrenching sadness, you feel tremendous guilt because you want your life to end.

HelplessYammie's observations and advice are good.  It's what I TRY to do.  I TRY to remember my depression mantra, *Watch the clock and wait it out*.  It's the hardest thing in the world to do, I know.  Please try."
depression,fg0xi67,t1_fd46fw5,1580416962.0,"Some do, some don't.  I've had many therapists in my life.  I've also worked in the mental health industry for 23 years.  Over the years I have battled with many serious depressive episodes as well as a bout of cancer.  I've never received one word or action of concern from any of my co-workers.  Not one."
depression,fg0vp3k,t3_ew120v,1580415945.0,"Many, many times.  Already twice at work today, with the door closed.  Ironically, I work at a counseling center.  Therapists don't really give a shit."
