We were doing this for 3 years and couple of months. People even stopped asking questions. They just assumed we are together.

If I were to narrate a story any proceedings should be split in a way that is fare to both of us. 75% to you and 25% to me. If translation is included than my percentage would be higher because it's closer to re-writing and it takes double effort and time.

Still, I think that narrator should have at best 50% of earnings.

Right now I'm actually excited to continue to study today and I just hope that I'll actually let myself do it, and not get distracted by 5 million things all at once.

One of issues I encounter far to frequently is not being able to even remember what I read two sentences ago. Now I'd decided I will just read the material, with that small set amount. No pressure on actually memorising, I just need to read through it. Lo and behold, I was actually able to better focus and I was able to recall what I just read. No pressure is *everything* sometimes! 

Being under pressure kills every chance of succeeding **but** I can't just not worry about something that is literally life-altering.

I realised I need to approach the subject from a different angle. Not sure how I'll manage to do it, but for an example, I know I'm good when it comes to English. My spelling and grammar are shit, but my understanding and vocabulary are on a different level from majority of people I know. I have exam in ""English for lawyers"" course in week and a half and I know I will kill it. When I approach studying all that different terminology and what not, I don't doubt my understanding of the matter. It's laid back approach and it does wonders.

Last year I turned down grade mark C because I knew I didn't put any effort into it so I had to re-take the test. There was no doubt in my mind I will get a better grade. In reality, anything could have happened and I was risking even failing it altogether. Still, I did what felt right and I got grade B. Close enough to grade I (think) that I deserve so I took it.

Now... It baffles me (and a lot of people around me as well) that I can understand (not just memories definitions) legal terminology and how legal system (on a surface level) work in both US and UK and be so sure and confident about it, while I can't pass similar things in my mother effing tongue.

Ok, English teachers aren't as strict and material isn't as in depth as it is when it comes to regular classes but still. I excel in something many people struggle in general, but can't pass same things in my native language.

Last year we studied (among other things) courts in UK and it's confusing af. Impeachment was another thing that we don't even have in our legal system so we can't even translate the word into Croatian and use English word, same as words solicitor and barrister (that is extremely rare, almost everything is translatable when it comes to general English).

I know I'm tooting my own horn but I'm rarely confident so I try to not undermine my strong side.

And yes, I'm aware my grammar is bad, but I never re-read my Reddit posts because fixing grammar isn't something I'm interested in doing here. As long as people understand me, I'm fine with it being extremely obvious I'm not a native speaker. I never even want to hide that fact. All I'm trying to say here is that I'm more confident in understanding and passing classes that aren't in my first language because I never encountered anything in English that I wanted to read and wasn't able to fully understand.

Why I don't have same confidence in other subjects I'm studying is a riddled no one was able to successfully solve thus far.

Yes, it's more ""natural"" or normal or acceptable to fail in second language classes but it isn't end of the world to not have A's in any other class. While I expect an A from English class I can't even say I'm capable to learn something for a D in Croatian?"

I guess sometime during those conversations I mentioned size. Not in inches but what I described would require either large or average size penis. He didn't fall in any of those categories. 

If I had known beforehand, I'd make sure to approach the subject in a manner that is applicable to his situation.

And to be honest, I was a little bit disappointed. Not in a size itself, rather the fact he wasn't comfortable enough to share that information with me and yet was comfortable enough to try to fuck me. I shared few insecurities of my own, just as a heads up. I know it's not the same but in a way it is.

JustBootThings,fdjeh5h,t3_elg8oc,1578467414.0,"I wonder does my dad value bond with his former troop over bond our family share. He is great man, not one to easily get mad or ever get violent, yet... I feel like he would flip the shit out if I asked something so stupid lol.

I'm not underestimating bond they were forced to create but I refuse to view it as more valuable.

It's as someone would ask do you love your parents or your SO more. It's different kind of love, in no way comparable and one should never be more important.

IDK... Just two cents from someone who grew up in a war zone with a father who always was father first and soldier twenty-fifth. He was and is much more than just one thing. He wasn't part of trained military but when war erupted he did what he felt is right - fight for your country. I love him beyond words can tell. (sorry for being all emotional, I'm a mess when it comes to talking about my dad)"
EatingDisorders,fde4ts9,t3_ekse8b,1578331200.0,"He sounds selfish and rude. 

Having an ED is one thing, but fate shame or make others uncomfortable because they aren't as thin or eat as little is something different.

He is either genuinely an A-hole or he's so deep into his illness it turned him into one. Regardless, person you want him to be isn't who he is right now. You see potential but reality doesn't match with it.

Until he's ready to peek his head from that self-digged hole and start to recover, he will not be a good partner.

It already took a tole on you and I wonder (because I also had similar problems) why do you perceive him as The One who you want to spend your life with while you're also scared of that future because it looks gloomy and sad? 

Don't ruin yourself and your progress for anyone. Partners should lift one another and not tear each other down. Intentionally or unintentionally.

Do yourself a favor and re-evaluate why do you like him, is he (or anyone) worth putting your literal life at line, why do you crave future that is so scary and painful, etc.

As a fellow ED haver, I know you know that you can't change him or his views regarding food as long as he himself doesn't start to seek that change."

I like to think that my English is ok, but it isn't (and prob will never be) on a native speaker level.

Being born somewhere doesn't automatically means language of that country is your mother tongue if you speak broken version of it.

I don't know where you live, but to put it into perspective, you couldn't be a translator because while you are Croat your language skills aren't on a native speaker level.

It's still awesome you put effort into learning it and I hope you continue to do so so that one day you can be on a higher level of understanding, speaking and writing in Croatian!

I can't remember what specific post it was, but I literally sent it to my friend as a joke because it was so insane and it couldn't be real - and it was from a meme page that was dedicated to making sarcastic memes. When you take it out of it real context you can create narrative of someone being ""nice girl"".

ADHD,f9fmgjq,t1_f9fklno,1575278952.0,">You mention you “don’t know” if you can afford the ticket home if you get meds. That seems to be a priority to you, so buy that as soon as you get your wages. 

I can't because I still don't have a set date when I will be travelling (depends on work). 

>See what you have leftover. You might have enough money if you are careful. 

I did the math and I know what I will have left over... Nothing. 
All gifts that are chosen but not bought were calculated in my budget im their cheapest form. 

>It might be better to eat cheap plain food for the rest of the month than skip your meds. Can you make instant coffee at work rather than buying it on breaks? 

I have minimal food costs (eating disorder can be useful lol) but I can't meal prep for eating at work. No place to store food or heat it. 

Also, no coffee machine except ones you need to pay to use (and get awful coffee not worth drinking and it few times gave me stomach ache). 

>Obviously I am not a doctor and it is your life, but from experience living in chaos doesn’t save me any money.

For me it does. Like I said, my monthly pay will be 3600, my rent is 1300, add meds cost and you get 1800 which leaves me with 1800. These two things alone will take half of my paycheck.

In comparison, having lunch break and drinking coffe is roughly 285 for entire month. That's both coffee and food.

I mean, I can always just buy medication and hate myself for the rest of the month. That also sounds healthy."
