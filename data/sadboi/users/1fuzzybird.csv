That was the moment when 16 year old me went from a little girl, to a grown woman...in the span of overnight. It made me question who I was as a person, and if I even had a purpose."

It's okay to not feel sad yet, or even to feel sad, and it's okay to not feel anything at all. You got this."

So the second part to this problem is:
Give one possible solution to the system.  Explain what the solutions represent within the context of the scenario.

Would that just mean a solution set inside the solution space?
If I'm correct, I think that solution set would be the amount of total drums he could make."

OCD,eoeswyy,t3_br6fdf,1558507060.0,"This post hit me harder than I thought it would. I've experienced OCD for as long as I can remember, but I've only been diagnosed last week. My entire childhood was filled with flicking the light-switch on and off until it felt ""just right"", stepping on the same floor tile umpteenth times until it felt okay, or having a precise order in my bedtime routine for over a decade now. 

You never realize how much mental illness robs you of your childhood until you look back and realize how much time you wasted."
OCD,eoesiya,t3_brclzi,1558506640.0,"This is something I've dealt with quite a bit too. I think what brings me comfort is this attempt I have to keep the belief that everything happens for a reason. It's far from foolproof and doesn't always work, but accepting that life is out of my control and trying to let the thought go has helped quite a bit. Even if it doesn't work - it's still a good mindset to hold onto."
