DepressionAndPTSD,fdm12cl,t3_elqmuz,1578537281.0,"I dont let it choke me anymore, or at least try my best not to let it. Try to seek the positive, as cliche as they may sound. Gratitude means a lot to me these days. I fear the day that I end up letting it get the best of me."
suboxone,fc8xyqm,t3_egk91x,1577543882.0,"If it works for you, it doesnt matter what anyone else says. It is a tool to reconstruct your life. Me personally, I've been on it for a while. I have to remind myself that it has allowed me to manage my life with addiction, and it's a form of recovery. My initial issue was with pain pills so I hear a lot of the same things. Everyone is different, different paths work for each individual. No one wants to be on medication forever. I try to take the perspective of it's a life saving tool, similar to a diabetic requiring insulin. It's for my disease and it allows me to live each day. Good luck, their is an implant and injection of the same medication. It would eliminate the pill form and be a monthly visit."
doordash,fc8wcxc,t3_egk59y,1577543098.0,Black square under his phone after second look.
doordash,fc8vaaf,t1_fc8uvt0,1577542578.0,"Same thought here, looks too small for tablet."
suboxone,f8sm82q,t3_e1qar4,1574784081.0,I have been wanting to make this switch for so long now. I was wondering the same thing if you feel the wds like with the strips or pills.
suboxone,f83qxf5,t3_dyom3s,1574218590.0,"I'm curious about the liquid taper, half water and everclear?"
suboxone,f7e43tl,t1_f7e28ss,1573645597.0,"Yes he does, but the trip landed on a refill date."
ptsd,f3zytgv,t3_dit1mb,1571280210.0,"Yeah, just read through medical records today. Whew, too much to read and too much I had put behind me to open back up and revisit."
limejuicer,f3lvb9t,t3_dgb05k,1570979910.0,"Yeah it will be awhile, they need an impound fee"
limejuicer,f3f2ltu,t1_f3ewjhr,1570888825.0,"It didnt last too long last time, I beileve Lime employees have to. More scooters to charge and ride once they are out of impound."
limejuicer,f3ewapa,t1_f3eq9f6,1570886350.0,I noticed they went back up a bit but looks like most of them are in Lime jail.
limejuicer,f3eops5,t3_dfmnjd,1570883248.0,"Oxford here too, it's hardly worth it.... üôÑ"
suboxone,f2tsabw,t3_de5hdz,1570399751.0,Call oh doctors now and make a plan so your not without. Safe than sorry.
suboxone,f28p4lb,t1_f28n5gn,1570067211.0,"Thanks, yeah I'll have to do it everytime after taking it now. I have to have one pulled this week and I'm thinking, I'm too young for this. I never really thought suboxene this far through. I was just grasping for straws."
suboxone,f28n4zi,t3_dces9o,1570065772.0,"Maybe the subs will be good for a bit, it does have the blocker. This way if you wanted to go on the binge, it wouldnt be possible. This was my reasoning when I first started on them. Just try taking what your body needs. Sometimes they can start you our on a high dose. Good luck ."
suboxone,f28m1pv,t3_dce49g,1570064979.0,"I started with getting hydrocodone prescribed, then more due to surgery's. Taking pain medicine because of chronic pain, lead me to heroin use. I'm glad to see this drug being used in pain management. I wish this option would have been available years ago. I currently am on it, and I always thought it helped with my pain.
 I dont want to be on it forever but the older I get, my body does too. Only time will tell with anyone. Good luck and thanks."
ptsd,eyf7btf,t1_eyeg9wu,1567044494.0,I want to be a part of this. F31
suboxone,eyf6ywr,t3_cwsg0d,1567044344.0,I have been on them for 3 years. If I were in your position I would ride it out. It happened for a reason ya know? Best of luck to you. Imodium and kava tea.
limejuicer,eya7exa,t1_eya61xs,1566959257.0,Yeah the drop off time says 7 am. I picked them up a couple hours ago. I wanted to go serve them around 12am when they are at 100%. I just didnt want it to lower my serve score if it was too early. I'm trying to get a higher cap.
suboxone,ewg664q,t3_co2nn8,1565374755.0,Not sure where your located and what insurance options you have but its definently possible. Have you tried different suboxene doctors in your area? Since you have been stable on it for a few years it shouldn't be tricky to be accepted into a new doctor. Have you tried a prescription discount card? It is a shame that something that keeps our lives in line can cost someone so much. Or even maybe an Obamacare plan if your interested in new insurance. Best of luck to you.
suboxone,ew5mif0,t3_cmw2gj,1565139852.0,"My doctor is every month, 2 weeks seem a little much. Dont pick up and you should feel fine until they are able to get you in."
suboxone,evqru2e,t1_evpihgx,1564696487.0,"Good thought, they would assume money was the only reason. When I'm just an addict in recovery and didnt want more pills thrown in my face. My partner wanted to take it far and I know I'm only going to be viewed as an addict with a background. I have made a complete 360 in my life thus far but my past will only follow. Hence the reason why I continued to take it in the first place. I would be able to receive treatment that wasnt state funded. I just dont want someone else to experience this the way I did either. I dont feel I should have to comb through details to ensure the doctor did their job."
suboxone,evplr7e,t1_evpiixv,1564675965.0,"Thank you, I needed to hear that. I do get so stuck in my head that it's hard to focus on the moment."
suboxone,evozswj,t1_evnyo6q,1564662619.0,"Thank you for your response. I understand that addiction stems from core trauma. I'm a lesbian in a family that hates it that is wicked religious some days. I wont get into my full life story for you on here, but extreme rejection from parents. Hatred towards a feeling i had telling me it was wrong, and not enough love in the home. I've thought of a million reasons why I wanted to start to put chemicals on my feelings. I think I also may need some real therapy as opposed to treatment that's mandated with medication."
suboxone,evoyx9f,t3_ckjkf2,1564661966.0,"I know I should have called the doctor when I noticed. I get everything your trying to say, I fucked up. I basically relapsed on the drug that help me build my life back up. This is why drugs like this are frowned upon in the recovery community. If the doctor or pharmacist or whoever messed up never would have given me the chance, i wouldnt be on it today. My partner is clean however, never used a drug in her life. She doesnt nessicarily comprehend the addict mind as much as I do. She is upset and saying someone should lose their job. I personally dont want to do it because I know I could have called. I'm an felon addict and that's why I was anxiety ridden in the first place. Its fucked up really, a drug is a drug is a drug. This one is just fda approved and slung like dope through treatment centers."
suboxone,evnz1uw,t3_cjmk8h,1564635132.0,Anymore over two and it's all psychological. Putting a pill on top of a feeling. I recently have done this and it's only made the situation worse
suboxone,evnyvax,t3_cjsnhc,1564635030.0,"App set aside, support your wife anyway you can. Props to you for asking. Emotional support ‚ù§"
suboxone,evnxiu6,t3_ckf5b1,1564634269.0,I have been doing through a bad time with suboxene as well. Go slowly and work on yourself before making the jump off.
ptsd,ev7185u,t1_ev64wu9,1564253922.0,Shoot I'm proud of you for understanding it all. Some fail to see an issue at all.
ptsd,ev710mz,t1_ev64wu9,1564253844.0,"Yeah an awesome therapist makes all the difference. Being clean definitely has more pros than cons, it's just another kind of battle. Against mental illness of any kind, virtually where the using began from. Just stay clean speak to God or whoever you want and just know that your worst day clean is better than your best day using."
ptsd,ev5cyzu,t3_ci3mxm,1564231723.0,Sounds like I was listening to myself speak. Getting clean seems all fine and dandy until the emotions surface. Then it's another beast to tame. Good luck vibes thoughts all that positive stuff.
ToolBand,ethi4ci,t3_cbppmg,1562816165.0,Umm.. Invinceable.
ptsd,esqhbpt,t3_c8vw2k,1562202487.0,I would be up for some conversation. Message away

aspergers,eq06g7n,t3_bwsyhz,1559679023.0,I completely understand. I work in an area that gives me the ability to work with elderly on occasion. No judgement and its kept simple.
aspergers,epoddc6,t3_buymwd,1559342435.0,I have read that different diagnoses like anxiety depression or bi polar can be misdiagnosed. When it fact some of the symptoms can be related to being on the spectrum. I was curious if you had been previously diagnosed with anxiety or anything else.
Guilt,epk5d3o,t3_bp84g1,1559267980.0,Yes guilt is real and its intuition letting us know not to do it again. I have felt the guilt of many lives. You have to ask yourself why you did it.
aspergers,epk03p0,t3_buymwd,1559264484.0,"I came to this thread for the exact same reason. Some of the things written are situations I have in everyday life. I now understand I am not the only one experiencing these occurrences, which is a relief. What have you been diagnosed with previously?"
AskDocs,eovv2wv,t3_avgk0b,1558901104.0,Thank you for your reply. I didnt think so but fo not have anyone to contact that's been in the same situation. Thanks again.
ptsd,eov3pzd,t3_bt58th,1558887939.0,"I can relate, wanting to escape all the past triggers or madness in your head. Remind yourself of the headache the next morning or just how awful it feels when using anything. Except weed, I dont smoke it but I sure wish I could. Learn how to deal with your head, throw it off if you wish. Kava. Try it. I wish the best if luck to you."
AskDocs,eotl51m,t1_ej43ys3,1558843191.0,New to posting here but found this post after searching. I have a question I hope you can help with. If someone fights the hep c virus off and only has the antibodies. Is it impossible to pass to someone?
aspergers,eor6zjj,t1_eoqz5yo,1558802048.0,Similar situation happened to me when my partner wanted to invite her ex over. I had a meltdown I'm assuming now. I felt completed mistreated and disrespected. Thank you for making me understand I am not crazy. Sorry I didnt reply to the original post.
aspergers,eooep1h,t3_bsam00,1558736698.0,"Thank you for your encouragement, I am gathering all of medical records. Then seeking to take it to a professional that specializes in this area. I hope all is well with you üòä"
aspergers,eoo3sqn,t1_eomjwxs,1558728528.0,"Thank you for the reply. I think that maybe it, therapy directed towards neurotypical brains. If I am diagnosed I feel I will be able to navigate more so through the fear and anxiety. I am 31 and just now realizing so much about myself. Self esteem and compassion is a factor that a diagnosis could compliment. Thank you again."
aspergers,eoo308e,t1_eolia1u,1558727938.0,Thank you for your reply. I have read post on this thread and I can relate to them. I have had similar experiences. I will probably seek out another therapist. Thanks again.
