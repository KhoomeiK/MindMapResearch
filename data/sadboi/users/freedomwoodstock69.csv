schizophrenia,ff31782,t3_ercsi3,1579530947.0,"I have schizophrenia. Weed used to be enjoyable. When I started smoking as a teen it would make me laugh, but I would black out lots. My thoughts would become disorganized and I would become confused by reality resulting in me saying strange disorganized things. Now when I smoke it I get instant psychosis even though I'm medicated. I start ruminating, get depressed, sounds become different, I hallucinate auras around people, hallucinate lights, I get overwhelmed with fear and have a hard time differentiating my thoughts from spoken word. When I don't take meds for an extended period of time I suffer from every symptom of schizophrenia except hearing voices and end up in a psychiatric ward.

Mdma caused major episodes in me. All symptoms of schizophrenia happened except hearing voices. So all the types of delusions, completely disorganized thought to the point I can't communicate etc. When I took it I ended up in psych wards.

atheism,f9kjfe8,t3_e5eh1x,1575401697.0,"I have schizophrenia. I thought God talked to me amidst my delusions and sincerely believed it to the point I even hurt myself. I was hearing voices in my head that legitimately seemed to be coming from an outside source. My God delusions are usually present with other delusions though such as thinking I can hear peoples thoughts or that aliens are watching me and I have to hide etc. Along with delusions my thoughts become disorganized in an episode (solely when I don't take my meds) and my words become word salad. For example a disorganized sentence could be ""the dog needs a pumpkin to red the spaceship in dishonesty for the ocean"". Hallucinating things like lights is also a present symptom that is paired with communicating with God for me. Schizophrenia is complex in that it manifests with an entire spectrum of symptoms. If someone prays harder or reacts minimally after thinking God has spoken to them, they're probably just manifesting the idea on their own. If someone reacts as a danger to themselves or others and stops taking care of themselves following communication with God, psychosis and schizophrenia likely have something to do with it."

Some people have to spiral to accept help. If you feel it's too difficult for you to be patient then staying with him isn't fair to him. It's not likely he's going to seek help on his own unless he gets fed up with the way his life is going. Unless he's a harm to himself or others it's not your place to do anything although you can continue to state the obvious.
