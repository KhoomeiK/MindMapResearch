Anxiety,fpsjze4,t3_gf6jfm,1588874751.0,They're really two forms of emetophobia. Those that have a medical or environmental reason for throwing up a lot more than the average person and those that rarely or ever throw up but have an intense fear of it happening and manage their life to minimize the risks. You need to determine how much of it is fear and how much of it is anxiety because medication probably helps more in general for people that have anxiety induced upset stomach versus those that have a fear but without the active threat constantly.
