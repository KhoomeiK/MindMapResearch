mentalhealth,fc7z6y8,t1_fc7x7lt,1577522566.0,You said it better than I could have
offmychest,fc3uj66,t3_eg1ueu,1577398982.0,"Dudeee, I had like the same incident happen with my ex and I. And I was freaking out too, don't worry sometimes the period's late coz well it's late. We had a huge fight about it at the time and that was coz both of us didn't really have anyone to go to. I'm telling you, she's going to go all crazy on you (add the PMS) but that's only going to last for a bit. I'm sure you understand what she's going through so I suggest to let her rant it all out just for a bit longer and make sure that you listen to her and address every concern of hers. Meanwhile, if you ever feel like ranting out to someone, go ahead DM me. I know how you feel right now, I got you."

mentalhealth,fc32xag,t1_fc30i4m,1577380202.0,Maybe start looking for stuff that allows you to work from home on a deadline basis? Either way I'm sure you'll find a job you love sooner rather than later.
mentalhealth,fc2zwes,t1_fc2vt8y,1577378281.0,Hope you're able to find one soon
mentalhealth,fc2sfhu,t1_fc2safs,1577372688.0,"Have you considered taking a break from the job? Looking for another one maybe? It may seem difficult to manage at first but if you can get by for a month, maybe some time to yourself would help?"
mentalhealth,fc2s0wq,t1_fc2pyka,1577372345.0,How do you plan to do that if I may ask?
depression,fc2akf2,t3_efsx5x,1577348776.0,I do like to keep myself busy so I don't have to deal with my thoughts but most of the times I can't. When I have nothing to do I go into an endless spiral of self loathing. I don't know if this is how you feel exactly but I would suggest to keep yourself occupied with something throughout the day.
offmychest,fb0r9yy,t3_eayq9c,1576428579.0,It'd be nice if there were more people like you

CasualConversation,fb0q4zf,t1_fb0pm0j,1576428302.0,"Bad terms with B, better terms (probably the best in that situation) with A. Weird part is I don't even think one bit about either of them until and unless they text me first. And I'd be okay with them hanging out alone with another guy, like I wasn't the overpossessive jealous guy (I hope). Why do I feel this shit now man? Annoying af"

depression,f56yhnj,t3_dn1mg2,1572029237.0,Happy Birthday! Have a great one. Know that we're proud of you and always hear to listen :)
