bipolar,ffu46zc,t1_fftjmtt,1580234125.0,"Yeah, when I was first diagnosed by like let’s say the first five doctors, I kept going to new doctors.. not believing i had it esp when they tried to give me drugs that were for schizophrenia’s.  I then really reserched it and I had done I think all the things it said... thing is I use to be more manic.. but that meant i was extramly happy most of my life, then a few tears after my mother died I got really depressed and I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 mixed episodes.. which meant i would switch from highs to lows very rapidly and frequently.  I seem to feel more depressed now and miss my manic energy, though i can smile it isn’t the same, i use to be plastered with a huge smile and the happy energy to go with it, nowadays I hardly find anything funny and laugh.  I just hate sometimes how the doctors don’t want my mania coming back, that to me is happiness.. I am sad without it.  But with the mania does come recklessness and spending sprees, fast driving and more of the like.  Well I would freely admit to anyone and have done so, by telling them/ him or her that I am bipolar.  I never knew of bipolar till I was older, and saw how i was always bipolar.. just didn’t care to find out till the depression was way more than the manic.  I had a bunch of bad episodes, and was more open to find out about it.. though i have yet to find a drug to truly help me geodone worked for a minute till i had to stop taking it because it made my skin crawl...  i actually wanted to do things again like inspiration to get up and go go go i started sewing at that time, maybe I’ll try and try this drug again,, oh my I’m rambling on lol, take care all!!"

Xoxo best of luck to the poster and all in this life."
WritingPrompts,fftr26f,t3_ev5uy7,1580227468.0,"After I gather the guts to face the unknown, I open the door and go in.  It’s very dark, I’m not sure if there is a light switch, I keep moving forward.  I come across a knob of another door, so I open it. It leads me to my house, but in the past.  I can tell from my childhood toys around... I wonder if I will see myself.  Would that cause the universe to explode? Will I get to see my Mother again? Am I a ghost? 


     It is morning here, when I first opened the door it was night, time sure did change fast!  There is a mans coat and hat hung up on the coat stand next to the piano.  I see my Dad was still living with us.  And I had the greatest idea, for knowing what was to come, I can make everything right, the way history should have been played out.  

     My parents end up getting a divorce, my father cheated on her and winds up going to jail from stealing money where he works.  He also didn’t lavish my Mother with any of the money.  He went on trips to Vegas and hired prostitutes, gambled and snorted coke.  My mother on the other hand worked very hard, took care of me, created many crafty items and well is just a strong women.  She went through many sad, hard times.  She even stood up to the credit industry, after my father put them in debt, she wrote letters and was on the phone hours trying to get her credit back in good standing.  My father made it difficult, because they were married his debt affected hers.  So I will fix all this an ease my mother’s suffering, but how?

   Walking outside in the past brought back memories I haven’t thought of in years, it’s like my innocence came back.  I was happy, renewed, and free.  Strolling along my old town thinking of a solution, I finally decided what I was going to do!  I’ll write my dad a letter and tell him to stay in the Air Force, because in the future on his deathbed he says life is short and that he would have stayed in the air force.  I’ll also tell him about his upcoming visit with the slammer, and to stay clear of Vegas, gambling, prostitution, and coke.  I managed to write a compelling letter and hoped my dad would heed the warning.

     I returned to the door, went back through the dark room to the other knob and went in coming out to present day.  I checked the house for signs of the past.  Because now my parents are both dead, or are they I come to find them in the kitchen old and happy kaughing making supper. I broke down in tears smiling, running up to them in their arms hugging them once again. I love you Mom and Dad.  The End. Ps. I went look for the door again but it was gone, I felt I had finished my destiny and the door was no longer needed."

Life’s short enough already without murders, so do me a favor and re-evaluate your life and wake up already. I doubt they say to treat your neighbor as yourself just for the hell of it.
