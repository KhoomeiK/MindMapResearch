This lady has been following me around for a while now, trying to fix me up with her teachers she knows from ""show-biz baby"". How lame. I didn't think people really say stuff like that but I guess that's damn musician types for ya. And now I'm one of them.  Not only one of them, but the greatest musician alive. Well, I suppose that's the truth only by default, but whatever. 

""That ""fella"" was your teacher, and he was only trying to help."" Tay retorted. ""And some victim you are, I haven't been able to play the guitar for months. Plus I'm stuck dealing with you, a lazy good-for-nothing who can't figure out how to play the damn drums with all the help in the world!""

It's not like I give a damn about music anyway, I was just playing for fun till that geezer baldy embarrassed me in front of everyone. What an absolute shit turkey, I'd like to give him a swift kick to the teeth next time! Well I'm not much for fightin though. Not much for anything really. Wait I'm at lunch. Look at that, too big time to remember what the hell I'm doing. Is she still talking?

 ""God why don't you just beat it!?"" She blurted out of frustration. 

""Hey, I do plenty of that"" 

""What"" 

""with the drums, I mean..."" I quickly corrected myself. ""Anyway I don't get better no matter how much I try. Maybe you should just find a new hobby.""

""I can't"" Tay's eyes looked down to the table. 

""Why not?""

""I've been playing the guitar since before I could walk. My dad taught me to play with passion because ""music is the language of love"" or some other odd thing like that. When I lost him, I continued to play to remember him. Now I can't even play a note, and I'm afraid I'll forget him too..."" She trailed off. 

""You haven't forgotten how to play the heart strings, have ya?""

""Shut up."" She smiled. 

""Well,"" I said while before polishing off my glass. ""I'd like this to be over too, you're the only person who knows it was my fault everyone became a bunch of tone deaf buffoons. If people like that find out I did it, there'd be a ton of damn geezers and creeps lining up to try to help me, that'd be annoying."" 

I started sounding more frantic. 

""I bet they'd force me to practice all hours of the day, probably without any breaks for even going to the bathroom oh man what would I do? You know they say creative types sometimes turn to their craft to stave off their dark desires? What do you think their capable of after a few months without it? Shit shit shit""

""They might just kill you to save themselves the trouble of training an idiot like you."" Tay said nonchalantly.

""Damn! I didn't even think of that!""

""That's why you need to listen to me, because there's a few people left who could fix you. I have some contacts we can go meet after this.""

""How'd you get these guys on board with this anyway?""

""Lets just say I haven't forgotten my days playing the flute with an old friend.""

""Oh?""

""Or playing the trombone with another old friend.""

""Oh ho?""

""Or sucking that other guys... anyway I know how to get my music into the right hands."" Tay finished.

I'll go through with it for now, not like I have anything else to do. None of this makes sense anyway, but I guess that's show-biz baby!
