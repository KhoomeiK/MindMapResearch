Depersonalization,fq1knxt,t3_ggfk18,1589046502.0,"Yes! It feels like your daydreaming but it's more vivid like a dream. This used to turn into sleep paralysis for me, but luckily now its just like that. You're not crazy!"

IsItBullshit,f4d7vlw,t3_dk8937,1571539094.0,"In restaurants that's only usually the case with alcohol. Otherwise, they probably pour a lot of ice just to keep it cold. If someome asked for less or no ice, they still get a full glass of whatever they ordered."
AskWomen,f453j5n,t3_dj6gdl,1571365203.0,"I'm get my certificate in Veterinary Nursing. I also am training at a Veterinary Emergency Hospital to be a veterinary nurse when im done school. The field is almost all women. The few men in my college courses and the 1 male at the emergency hospital, that works as an assistant like I do, are very kind and talk to us normally. I don't see any sign if feeling threatened at all. They get along just as well ad the females get along with each other."
ibs,exkhgm6,t3_ct8gvf,1566389628.0,Mine starts as soon as I start getting the worst part of my period. Like the time you already hate where its so painful and you're bleeding profusely is when it acts up the most and I'm running to the bathroom multiple times.

TwoXChromosomes,eqis5ru,t3_byivzl,1560092732.0,"I like that everyone will tell you you're terrible until a situation like this would happen to them. You're very strong OP, thank you for taking the time to share this story. I think this also helps to put into perspectice why a 6 week period is not nearly enough time for a woman to schedule an abortion, why birth control and morning after pills are very important, and that abortions are NOT ""easy waya out"" and that its excruciating and heart breaking even though it's absolutley the right choice. I think more stories should be shared like this because many people that believe its selfish and just ""murdering a baby"" don't kbow what it's actually like. I have friends and siblings who went through this and i can say they did not walk out of it smiling."
TooAfraidToAsk,eq656c3,t1_eq46pnz,1559822200.0,Thank you for opening up about your story! I have trans friends that I was too scared to ask them this question so I appreciate this a lot. I know a lot of non-trans people are confused about it and don't want to ask questions out of fear and now i feel like I have this story to help them. You're awesome!
depression,eoe304g,t3_brffm6,1558486985.0,"I don't think it's that noone cares. I think it's that people get absorbed in their own lives and problems and they don't notice things going on in someone elses life or don't know what to do. There's a lot of people that don't understand mental illness, but there are many that do and are just going through shit themselves. When you're in a depressed state, it truly does feel like noone in this world can hear you while you silently scream for help. It used to make me angry. I've had clinical depression since I was very young and when I'm out of it and feel normal it gives me a new perspective on myself and others. People do care, we're just all lost and in our own worlds afraid of our existence."
