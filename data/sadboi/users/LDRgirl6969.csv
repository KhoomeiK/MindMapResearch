It didn’t matter that it was long. okay spelling it over the phone is a pain but other than that I love it. It makes me special. And I have three middle names on top of that so I’ve always felt extra special with my long name.

What about

What about Mabel? You could even spell it Mabelle, which like someone else said, means the same thing as Majolie in French."

I work from the comfort of my home and if I have a stressful meeting I can cuddle with my boyfriend. I don’t have to worry about surprise interactions. The only thing is i miss my family and my best friend. But honestly I’m good and I don’t want to go back.
weddingplanning,fqa124d,t3_ghmrv1,1589210887.0,"Wow that’s messed up. You look great. I also got body shamed at the dress store I went to. When they measured me for my dress they said “a size 8 will be a bit tight but it will work”. Then when I went to try it once they received it, the size 8 was too small. And the entire time the woman was making jabs at the fact that I must have gained weight (I didn’t) and maybe next time I’m there for my fitting I’ll have eaten only salad and I’ll fit in the dress. That industry can just be so awful and petty. Ugh. Don’t let it bring you down. You are beautiful."

Boys:
Thomas Isaac

weddingplanning,flununc,t1_flukyuw,1585506376.0,"All of those exact same thoughts are going through my head too. I love my dress so much. I want to be able to wear it. And I can’t even guarantee I would have had a baby in the next year but this just closes the door on it. Or maybe it doesn’t and then I’m either pregnant or I’ve gained weight and either way I can’t fit into this amazing, perfect dress that is already tight on me
Because they measured me wrong the first time. 

My wedding was supposed to be June 20. And my honeymoon was going to be Italy, of all places. Nothing has been cancelled yet but I know it’s what’s going to happen. I’m getting more panicked by the day. Even if we can have a wedding in June, which is unlikely, I can’t get my dress altered and my fiancé can’t get his suit fitted because everything is closed. I’m so not gonna be ready for June."

It’s not true that it’s double the competition, if that’s what you’re worried about. It doesn’t mean he’s attracted to more people, just some of each gender. Being bi has no impact on faithfulness and he has said himself he won’t act on it. Unless you have other issues with the relationship, you should stay. That is, only if he makes you happy."
