Also, he is supportive on most occasions. But he can get super short-sighted when his other brain starts thinking for him. Sometimes, I wish that other brain of his gets migraines."

JustNoSO,fngkael,t3_g1k0ja,1586934954.0,"Not overreacting at all. If anything, you may be under-reacting. I understand that he may have some good points (I saw one of your comments) and maybe apart from his cheating you feel like he treats you right. But you have to weigh out the pros and cons of your relationship. 

Are you willing to continue feeling like shit cause he doesn't think you're enough? Are you willing to have your autonomy, privacy, and freedom to use your phone taken from you indefinitely? Are you willing to get hurt again when he cheats on you a second, a third, a fourth time? It's very real possibility since he's already done it once. Are you willing to make excuses for his mistakes all the time? 

I know you might be thinking that maybe you're the one who's at fault. But think about it. Who cheated who? If you're willing to sacrifice your self-respect and self-esteem for a few morsels of his attention, that's your choice."

What your friend is is entitled, and it's a good thing you called her out on it. I would like to hope she comes to her senses, but I think that's a long shot. And calling you ""fake friends""? Really? She sounds exhausting and on her way to becoming toxic.

I just either shoo them away with my hand/paper or (in this instance) take pictures till they leave on their own. 


I transport them either by paper since I don't want to accidentally squish them by hand. 


I don't really know what I'd do if one gets in a socket since I have yet to encounter that situation.


HOWEVER, please don't take this as advice. The spiders we have in my area are rarely dangerous (only 2 invasive species which are kept in check by native spiders). All I can say is BE CAREFUL."
