Maniac,fkqemwm,t1_fkqd4e5,1584442933.0,"My first chapter has mostly been about realising deep rooted fears within myself, mostly feeling too scared to try change anything within my life for the better. Of course with this realisiation I had to accept it was my own wrong doings, however also trying not to beat myself up about it too much because it's part of the journey of life. Chapter 2 then involves branching out my options, like a growing tree, figuring out what works and what doesn't work, which can be quite scary, but part of the process.   


But of course, with all the corona news, it feels as if the world has came to a stand still currently. 

One realisation I've made is that there is no specific ""right"" way to go through life, and even the speed of which we do things is personal to our own lives. So to relate it back to yourself, go easy on yourself, rest whenever you need it, and listen to your instincts about how you should go about personal tasks. And although I don't know you, I can safetly say, you are not a fuck up. We are all going through our own journies at our own pace and don't let anyone stop you, or force you to do other things. This is your life, play it how you feel best.  


Thanks for the anime reccomendations. I'll have to check them out some time. 

May your year be prosperous, and your health well. :)"
