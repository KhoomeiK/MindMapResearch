IDK. If this happens all the time, simultaneously, I'd doubt about bipolar because it's very rare to have a perpetual mixed episode. Bipolar goes in phases (sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes stable, sometimes mixed...). There are big changes within these phases, like loving life/being suicidal or being insecure/being cocky. In average, these episodes last thirteen weeks. _Officially, hypomania should last at least four days, mania seven or any if hospitalized, and depression two weeks._ 

ADHD was repetitive, and it is possible, considering it's more than distraction. ADHDers also have emotional problems, they are prone to depression, they are impulsive, they often procrastinate, and overall it's a hard disorder. In this case, think if you have experienced symptoms since childhood. If you had no symptoms before thirteen, it's something else. _But you'll need a doctor to determine it. Actually, you need to talk all of this with your doctor. I'm just trying to think with you here, but a doctor can diagnose you or rediagnose you._

BPD should be suspect number one when talking about rapid mood swings, and you also mention difficulty trusting, and they sometimes have an intense fear of abandonment that could also look like fear of betrayal/fear of sharing someone, etc. For this one, just read the nine symptoms from the diagnostic criteria. If it sounds too familiar, tell your doctor. 

There's also a little bit of trauma and bad environment associated symptoms in there. Could it be that you're experiencing some sort of burn out/stress thingy from a bad home or something like that? 

Oh! Also check hormones, thyroid, etc. It's crazy, but those physical illnesses can really mimick mental disorders.

Sorry for the sloppy/ugly comment. Remember that you need to ask a doctor, and get second and third opinions if you don't feel the diagnosis/treatment is right. The point is to get good therapy/meds and feeling better, so I hope you get there soon :)

The thing is feminism made me realize I was doubting myself because of mere stereotypes! What if I had extra hair without my treatment, or if I have a low pitched voice? I'm still a female human being, as normal as any other. I appreciated then my own body, my own personality, my own things. In conclusion, I said ""fu*k the Barbie or nothing mentality"", and now I feel comfortable in my skin. Well, thanks to that and treating my mood disorder. I guess I'm an... agender AFAB?

Then, mania kicked in and I was no longer suicidal, at all. Actually, I enjoyed life again to the point I cried thinking it could end without an afterlife. I was fascinated with everything and I wanted to do everything. Suicide was an absurd idea because I felt I had so much to do!

You are certainly not alone and I've seen many unipolar depressives, borderlines, and other people thinking like you, because they carry certain degree of pain everyday or almost everyday (like a black cloud). That is a very hard thing to do...

Sending people home with a bunch of antipsychotics and other expensive medication is not good practice in the majority of cases. Lithium and anticonvulsants should be consider stronger in our treatment plans.

So... I believe you are perceiving a real problem and a real thing (the gifts of bipolar), but that's half the story. There are also stories of success on lithium and other medication, and there are also very dangerous consequences for some unmedicated cases.

Absolutely not, unless you also understand ""ethics"" as living well yourself. A mental disorder is defined as a pattern that is harmful to oneself and causes distress/dysfunction. The only ones that are harmful to others (and often not to the person themself) are antisocial personality disorder or ""sociopathy"", and paraphilias involving others such as pedophilia and sadism. 

Many other mental disorders are not only different ways of perceiving and living, but different ways that are getting valued in these years because they are not entirely a negative experience. The thing is to guide people with mental disorders to a better life, while acknowledging advantages, if any ([creativity from bipolar](https://www.bphope.com/bipolar-mania-creativity/), [structure from autism](https://www.livescience.com/16849-autism-advantages-research.html), [realism from depression,](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201206/depressive-realism) etc.).

> A mental illness is an impairing, distressing, or otherwise harmful mental state which has an onset and a cure.

When I was exploring radical feminism on Reddit (both TERFy and non-TERF) to get to know it, I found a femcel sub. I don't know if I can recommend it... I didn't read it enough and, I mean, maybe it's not healthy to define ourselves that way, and to keep a narrative in which you will always be lonely, but their name is about pink pill and feminism if you want to Google it.

About feeling rejected all the time, could it be that it's accentuated by a mental disorder (like feelings of not belonging due to depression, fear of abandonment from borderline personality, rejection sensitive dysphoria because of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder...)? Those things can be treated.

I hope everything gets better soon."

I don't know if I should be doing it, but it sounds airy and the little pats get rid of that ""air"" and it feels better. Fellow zebra? I dislike these people faking what was causing me so much trouble some time ago (and I stay for the drama, I admit)."
