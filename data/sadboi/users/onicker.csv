falloutlore,fqu8ocs,t3_gkz99p,1589654173.0,"I believe the ""eating"" we see ferals partaking in isn't for sustenance. It seems to be a symptom of their mental degradation. 

For non-feral ghouls, eating meals, drinking and participating in other normal activities would help them mentally cope with their bodies changes better, than say, not eating anymore and slowly forgetting what it is like to be a ""normal"" person. 

In our quarantine situation currently, we can feel the kinds of strain isolation has on a normal person's mental state. It's only natural to experience similar, if not more prominent, strain when ghoulification occurs. 

For some basis from the games, I would generally mention any conversation you have with non-feral ghouls. Many are mistreated, enslaved and because of that and discrimination they are forced into hiding. Even worse still, they are sought after for extermination by more militant groups (like the BOS or the Free States).

 In 76, we get a lot of notes and entries regarding people's lives as they first started to change and the number of situations ended in them being murdered, either by people they'd previously been sheltering with or strangers who mistake them for their mindless counterparts.

It really boils down to being able to stay conscious of your humanity, regardless of these very stress inducing factors, which may include something as simple as have some Fancy Lad Snack Cakes with a Nuka Cola. Treating yourself well, when no one else around you does, is a huge coping factor for people who suffer with mental health and attempting to create reminders that you are worth survival. The first action healthcare providers take is getting the person on a schedule and providing them with activities that cement their sense of purpose.

As we see in the game, many of the ghouls are scavengers, store owners or caravan runners. They've either joined gangs that would take them or formed communities of those like them, where everyone has a purpose. They allow that sense of purpose to drive them in a world that seeks to destroy them, either through social isolation or physical harm. 

Maintaining other aspects of a normal life could also aide other's perception of them, while also providing a usual routine. Maybe them seeing a ghoul eating noodles subconsciously aides in the following acceptance, or tolerance of their existence in communities where they are amongst the smooth skinned.

(I hope this help and sorry for drawing on and on.)"

AskCulinary,fpjmhvf,t3_gdu8dm,1588674031.0,"Exactly as they said. The leavening in croissant dough is done mainly by the moisture from the butter layers being released while cooking. If you add moisture of any variety to the dough layers before rolling then may combined and cause for an uneven rise and dense product. Egg is a binder in most recipes, it contains a protein that help coagulate and emulsify mixtures (like cakes). If you use it in this manner it will definitely bind those layers together and you will not get the kinda croissant you just worked hours to prepare.

I stand to mention buying store bought dough and using that to experiment with new ideas is always a cheaper and less labor intensive way to see how this stuff works for yourself. 

I'm currently in school for Baking, that's the only reason I have any idea how this works."

BipolarReddit,fbaipfm,t1_fbag4l5,1576679214.0,"I used to see it that way. But when I almost overdosed and spent three months in institution and saw the pain I caused and the financial burden it put my already broke family through...it was selfish.

 It will always be selfish and when you spin it to around like an act of selflessness it's just you making an assumption, which is another form of thinking selfishly. You can hardly understand your own emotions but you're gonna go ahead and assume you've got everyone else figured out?

It's hard to live with mental illness. Not everyone (including the people who love you dearly) will always be able to cope with your illness. They can be mean and in their own way selfish in the way they respond to us. But as we also feel overwhelmed and act out in reaponse, it is selfish to think others will not when put under emotional (and for some of us physical) duress.

 It is cruel to think your mental illness only effects you and not everyone else you interact with. It's cruel to think killing yourself will be a release. And of all things, it is weak and if you do it you let the illness win.

When my father got diagnosed with cancer last year all I could tell him was to stay strong. That me and my brother were here for him. That he could beat it. It took a lot of change and doing things he wasn't fond of and feeling like shit emotionally and physically.  It was a grueling year and a half but he did it. He's slowly recovering and the new processes he introduced to his lifestyle continie to benefit him everyday.

All i could think was its just like when I almost killed myself. There were new processes I had to get familiar with, new trains of thought I had to ride. It all sucked and was painful and annoying and it made the people around me bitter, including my father. But thinking back I was just fighting my own cancer and my father also wanted me to stay strong.

My brother battles schizophrenia everyday and he is finally in a place where he is on his way to stability. You know how many times he spun that same rhetoric to me? That if he died he would relieve everyone of his ""burden"". The burden that is his existence. It hurt me so deeply. I found myself lashing out at him many a time during his episodes (and he has during mine) but it was out of frustration not spite. I told him the same thing I had to tell myself so many times. 

You are not alone no matter how your illness spins it. You are not hated no matter the times you see those who are supposed to support you break down or lose their composure. You are not a burden and at the end of the day the burden you carry that is your mental illness is your cancer to beat. It is your battle to fight. If you were sent to the battlefield you'd fight for your life so why won't you do it now? If you've been fighting this long why give up now?

Most of us have gone through the shit and know we will have to face it again. Wear your sludge like a fucking medal. You did it and you continue to regardless of how it may hurt sometimes. Evemtually you'll get to a place where you'll know it.

I also gotta say dying hurts. As I was overdosing I realized I didn't want to go. I was fortunate enough to vomit damn near my whole stomach up. I heaved and sweat and cried. I wiped blood from my own lips and felt my heart slow. I cried for the first time in my life about not wanting it to end. I fought it. I fought my demons and came out with a bad gut. Now I don't get to enjoy a whole aspect of living because I was too selfish to see the gift my life is even with its burden. I refuse to let others perceive their own life that way because ai refuse to let anyone else get to the edge and jump just to realize halfway to the pavement you were wrong.

Please consider what I've said. If not for those in your life but for you. Please continue to fight for your life, although it may be as selfish as ending it. It's the kind of selfishness that will at least grant you the opportunity to be truly selfless when the moment arises. It will allow you the time it may take to win the battle once and for all. It won't be today or tomorrow or maybe even next year. But you'll at least be there for the day it does come.

Take care of yourselves and stay strong brothers and sisters. We can do this.

Edit: I can only say what I've said being a survivor. I have only learned what I have shared through existing. I have only shared this because it is what happens unless you are successful at killing yourself and if you ever are its selfish to leave others with the pain you wished to escape from. You only ever transfer it to others. It will never go away for them weather you live or die. So if you think your ""saving"" everyone you're mistaken. Your only saving yourself. And if you get offended or triggered being told this it's clear your not thinking about anyone but yourself. I know because I did think that way for a long time. I did get offended when called selfish. But you really don't want to go through what i did to learn it, I promise. There is a guilt that never goes away and it is deeper than the guilt you feel for being alive in the first place."

BipolarReddit,f93ayvr,t1_f92xege,1575054384.0,That sounds like a very inspiring thing to be apart of. It is so important to connect with others. The bond between survivors can be a valuable resource. I'm glad to hear ypu have such a space and hope that you can find solace in knowing you are not alone. There may be more obstacles but our lives are just as valid and our experiences matter even if we cannot always digress on how they affect us. I hope you stay well dear.
BipolarReddit,f92hkz8,t3_e3dn6g,1575031459.0,"Never forget we all create surface levels for our interactions with, in honesty, strangers. You were most likely not the inly one there harboring dark histories. We as a society have invoked some rule where we are not allowed to digress the atrocities commited against us to others as it would ""ruin the energy/create a negative space"". BUT in actuality if we all confessed to our traumas a little more often maybe the socciety as a whole would learn humility. 

For also living with mental illness we are forced to be even more conscientious of what we tell others as to avoid being stigmatised. Because we do often get treated as if we are more emotional than the situation calls for. 

I want to say you were right in not fully opening up. Women's retreats feel like a place you should be allowed to be yourself unapologetically. Unfortunately most people would rather not and that is an insufferable bit of fine print we've all been tricked into abiding. 

I know others cannot conceive my trauma or even acknowledge my retelling of it as theraputic. It is often considered unwarrented even if they had just opened up about similar experiences.

  Just know that as a survivor to your own trauma you are doing fine. That no one needs to hear all about how you survived because no one else will appreciate your own presence as much as you.

 Be happy you have made it this far and that you can acknowledge these things at all. Many live blindly to their own experiences and it can take a lot away from them. You can actualise your feelings which is beneficial to you but also to the relationships you build with others.

Stay strong sister, you got this no matter the odds.

Unfortunately the bombs fell during his trial 30 days and no one survived. Everyone was to eat supplemental food he'd invented but were not very pleased with it after a few days. 


I believe you were selected to participate in the certain aspects. The only thing I truly got out of that university was that it was a passive experience. You studied what you were told and given tasks to complete. Everyone got the basic medical, technical and operational training but only a select few went on to be head of research development for the vaults that contained experiments.

I believe 76s overseer was either going to 101 or another vault (can't remember the number now) but because she opted to not bring her ""spouse"" and not spread the news she found out ( which her SO recommended ) she was given a control vault to keep her from changing her mind.

I'm still trying to convince myself everyday that I cannot be the sole fixer/saver of the people and problems they may have. 

I came to this conclusion the morning after the dream but pulled a u turn on myself because I always worry about taking care of everything. Actually realized that when in the dream my SO was trying to help and I barked at him to leave it dead in the water. He often tries to help me look outside of my expectations for myself and with the last response I read , it would seem to symbolize him attempting to help me save these things about my I believe to be dead.

It's been a very hard thing for me to do. I've started school finally for something I never thought I'd love so much. I feel more alive then I ever have. It's still hard for me not to feel selfish. I've been taking care of whoever I live with since I was young. It's followed me into my longtime relationship. It's something I've always felt sadness over for a very long time and I feel this sadness all the time.

This makes a lot of sense to me. My mind is trying to show me my own suffering. That I can forgive myself and the things I could not control. That older cat looked so sad. It made me so sad. But I was more angry about the kittens so I cried and gave in. 

I will try my hardest to forgive myself. It's clearly what my spirit needs. 

I couldn't thank you enough. I would have never been able to read into it that deeply nor would I, in my current atate of mind, have accepted it if I'd come to such conclusions myself.  My own self worth was dimished the day I had to start taking care of my family when my mom left. I became the least important aspect of life, and anything I felt passionate about was not worth the time I had been given on this earth.  This just makes me want to try even harder to change that.

My mind would only produce such horrible images if it felt I needed to see them. Ever other disturbing dream I had was a wake up call to something I had chosen to neglect. Either a person in my life or a responsibility to myself.

Since the objective changes everytime you're there the mall could represent the things you're not typically apart of and the objective of the dream depicts the feelings you have about them.

No dream expert but after having a few of my own chalked it up to those lines of thought."
DreamDecipher,evozvhi,t3_cfzzph,1564662674.0,"I had a series of dream in high school where I was a mother to two little girls about two years apart in age.  One of the shortest was also the most feelings I'd ever felt in one dream. 

I'm waking up because the hallway light turned on and the light is coming through the cracked door. I realize my children are in bed with me and they are young maybe 6 and 4. The oldest started yelling at the door as it opens telling the person they aren't allowed here anymore. That it isn't their home and we're not their family. I hear my youngest behind my back and feel her warm tears fill up my shirt. My oldest also starts crying and clings to me. I feel sadness and hurt but also that feeling of knowing this would happen. Like the way my kids responded was a long time coming and the person should've dine something to prevent this. I couldn't bring myself to look up at the person the whole time so I don't know what they look like and they never spoke.

I was 16 at the time and feeling like I wouldn't know how to handle kids so it was strange for me to have such dreams be so vivid."

Cheap food, cheap housing...how to make the most money on the livestock you just purchased? Did that not at all run through your mind? Jesus y'all, the conditions of slavery were that you were purchased based on your utility, the same way people who choose horses and cattle. Men were workhorses, women were mares. They were put in poor conditions that weren't livable for human (and barely the other animals I've mentioned). It doesn't matter if they die because losses happen on a farm. Especially if the livestock was ""untameable"". 

Jesus H , if these movies are exaggerated it's with good reason. No one deserved to live in conditions even close to what you just mentioned. An anger problem walking that hits you when you fall still? And people are just supposed to be ok with no wages, just enough food to wake up the next morning after sleeping in the dirt under a tin roof while others amongst you go hungry and cold for their unwillingness to be tamed?

Or you are very correct and they're the same take 5 bars and they're using the Reese's peanut butter as the new selling point.

My wholesaler dropped 10 boxes of them on me during the last tradeshow for little to nothing per box. They often do this with product that's not been selling as fast as they have produced based on projected sales figures for the year. 

I love take 5 and would be so disappointed if they took them off the market. It's already needed to be repackaged once so I wouldn't be surprised if this is a second attempt at reviving sales."

MurderedByWords,euppa6c,t1_euo8v2p,1563961282.0,"We live in America, which has the lowest impulse control of most modern societies. You love pulling out these numbers but your logic is fundamentally flawed. How many of these shooting were actually unarmed men or women being shot point blank by a nervous cop? We have quite a few cases to choose from and often the officer who pulled the trigger is given paid leave. Quite a few of these cases the ""perp"" is a child. There is no justice for these families. How do you take care of a situation you can't handle when the officer you may call is just as likely to arrest you or even worse, shoot you, off of a uninformed assumption? You don't. Then you raise your children to think the same. Then you have a whole community of people who aren't receiving the same basic human rights as everyone else. 
I'm sure those statistics don't take into account how few families can afford college or are denied the same oppertunities as white students while in high school. How quickly they are left to the streets while they labor over this white student to get scholarships. All based on the same reasoning you've given above.

I'm saying your logic is fundamentally flawed because you use statistics instead of the compassion most humans are capable of producing when they read about these things. That your lack of it allows you to formulate these concepts that justify your bigotry. It's truly exactly the thing I mentioned in my first post.  It's the same logic that imprisoned people in the second world war. It's the same logic that caused a man to shoot a teenager listening to musix loudly in his car. It's this almighty logic you cling to that intentionally allows you to feel at peace with your mentality. It allows you to accept the hatred and neglect of POC communities in our country. It allows you to feel justified when you post them in rebuttle. It allows you never to look inward. Above all else it just proves the lack of change in our society is directly related to people who think like you.

If you wanna feel justified about anything feel justified about how you just proved you're a racist. I am totally sold and thank you for sharing the physical numbers many like you cling to in order to continue perpetuating this flawed mentality that stifles the progression of our country on a whole. 

I'll be sure to keep my ears toward the mouthpieces speaking them to me and recall our conversation. I will use you as the example the next time someone tells me no one thinks that way. This has not been a learning experience for me because I know too many people like you. Some of them are related to me. This is where I've learned the counterpoints I've made. My own experiences over those I've grown up with made me uncomfortable and it bothered me that everyone else had an excuse to why I shouldn't feel uncomfortable at all. Why they didn't and how much easier my life would be if I'd adhere to it. If I avoided people like that. How as long as I wasn't associating with those people I would never know hardship. If I would just disassociate from their inequality then I could bask in the world built to benefit me. If it sounds like indoctrination, thats because it is. The rhetoric your spouting reminds me of the bible, and those numbers may as well be the bible to racism. It's utterly inhuman and I don't comprehend how you can live with it as a basis of your understanding of the world.

 It truly is a privilege to feel the way you do and I hope one day someone else has the privilege to deny you basic human rights because of their flawed understanding that only benefits them. Maybe then you can vaguely comprehend what other Americans go through on a daily basis and have been for the last 70 years."

Edit: Also, if a percentage of those committing the crimes aren't being given sentences, do those statistic really mean anything? The point your missing is the system is rigged against people of color and that white people benefit from such a system? It in turn makes the data show they are the more violent community and justified the incarceration of POCs? Like a guy whose white commits the same crime as a black man but he serves 6 months in county while the other dude serve 20 to life in max?  But this person is clearly unbaised as is the data the collected from a system that hasn't made any general movement toward genuine equality is clearly honest and I should just believe what they told me because it got published?

MurderedByWords,euemfy2,t1_eue3r51,1563748080.0,"As someone who has read on many of murder and unsolved crimes in the US I can tell you right now most of the violent crime that happens in this country is usually perpetrated by a white male, roundabouts 35 to 50 years of age after they don't get their way. Spouses, strangers, neighbors. Fuck even their whole families sometimes. The ratio to white serial murderers to black is disproportionate at best, with many of the most heinous crimes being carried out by white men and often times they don't serve a life sentence. I don't know where you get off comparing the gang violence (which is a direct outcome of systematic racism) to just raw psycopathy. 

But now that I realize you may be one of those white men, I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
MurderedByWords,eudd79z,t3_cfw0eq,1563713261.0,"It's more like... most white people are inherently unable to identify racism when it is happening in front if them or when they are acting in a way that is demeaning to people of color. There is a large portion of whites that believe they are not racist while simulataneously calling the police when they see one or more black people in their neighborhood with the reasoning :
""I'm fearful for myself and others."" 
""They must be stealing something because they don't live here""
Meanwhile a car full of whites would be passed off as harmless and are initially given an excuse for their unwarrented presence. 
These same situations relate to police officers using deadly force almost immediately when responding to calls on black civilians, even minor calls and never or rarely using it in cases with white civilians, even if the situation warrents deadly force.

It's these often completely dismissed responses that are given an inadequate excuse for their use as to exempt the person from the harsh criticism that they are in fact prejudice. They just assume that everyone feels the way they do about it (not actualizing that their version of ""everyone"" consists of only the people who look and live like them.) It's been reduced to a natural thought in their mind. That having these kinds of thoughts is not dangerous to those it directly affects when they have interactions with others.
 ""You're pretty for a black girl."" 
""You're well spoken for a black person."" 
""You know where I can get drugs, right?""


There are so many more that I've heard now and it's honestly not a problem in any other community as flagrantly.  This dismissive mindset affects their ability to comprehend the offensive nature of their actions because their reprecussions do not directly fall onto them in their mind. To the point where even if you call a person like this out for being racist they dismiss you as the racist and assume the role of ""ally"" by either conveying they don't care what color you are and that they're acting in the way they are solely because they have reason ""my best friend is black"" ""I don't care if you purple, just be a good person"" 

This is what they mean when they say ""white people don't get to decide what's racist"". 

Half of white people on this planet can't even cognitively tell when they are being demeaning to a person of color (definitely not always a black person) or are able to identify when someone else is (like all this ""appropriation"" callout bs I see that gets smashed down by those native to the culture).

 They do not get to decide if their actions were or were not racist because they are too condeluded to identify the system of racism by it's identified traits. This is either purposely because they do feel they are better than POCs, which is indeed racists. Or they have been raised with these processes and have chosen to stand by them because the person who raised them with that mentality has also probably raised them not to trust any other form of information; which is just a racist making another racist which is definitely worse than just being a racist by yourself. 

Everytime a white person thinks they're justified in criticising a POC calling out this aspect, they are just proving they don't acknowledge the privilege they are afforded over others on a regular basis. They don't see color so they don't see the inbalance in all aspects of our society. So honestly, who's more qualified to make the observation?"

Don't get me wrong, FO4 was *meaty*. I spent over 200 hours playing and it kept itself interesting the whole time. It's just so filled with plot holes or no plot on things thst are mainstays in the world. I could understand if the den was a side quest not oertinent to the main story but it is. It should've had more information on who Amari and Irma were and why they felt it was good business to create their set up. How they did it. Where they come from. 

We used to learn a lot about other side characters in the older games and it was one of my favorite aspects. Made the world feel full and lived in.

Lyon's technically defected from the Brotherhood's mission to exterminate the super mutant threat on  the east coast. He even had a faction defect (outcasts) from him to continue the modus operendi of finding salvagable old world tech.

Maxon managed to bring the outcasts back into the Eastcoast BOS which was probably after Sarah Lyon's death when he took over as Elder. This boy has been raised in the history of his family and with the entire BOS doctrine as his life's mission.

 I've often wondered if he was indeed behind the fall of the Lyon's in the first place. If as he got older he started to understand the mission better. He saw how it differentiated from his ancestors goals. He heard the complaints of comrades on their lack of progress and although he loved Sarah like a sister had to end their altuistic quest to rehabilitate the wasteland so that the moral of his men would not lead to more defectors. 

The westcoast BOS are hard. They don't care what it is unless its putting valuable technology at risk of being misused or destroyed. They hide in bunkers to the point where the regular joe doesn't believe they're real. This is the foundation Maxons ancestors created and I believe that's what he believes in too.

Just the fact that Madison Li went to the institute shortly after they gained control of project purity and had to be *convinced/bribed* into working on Liberty Prime. That MacCready open admits how much better the commonwealth is, when the place he comes from has prominate drinkable water sources...it all just spells out bad business."

falloutlore,eu4b0tm,t3_cekl15,1563447287.0,"He was in the 2nd battelion 108th infantry regiment in the sino-american war, the same regiment in which the soldiers from Mothership Zeta were active in. 

The wikia seperates them but the 108th infantry battelion is just shorter terminology for the 108th infantry regiment, 2nd battalion. It's based off the NY Army National Gaurd where the second battelion is it's only battelion.

It would seem that  they were abducted after arriving in Alaska they still hadn't successfully taken back Anchorage yet. There's dialougue in which the Medic Elliot tells you they were sent to recclaim anchorage and end the war. Elliot was drafted into the military and was working as a doctor. 

I would like to mention though that it seems Nate was very much apart of it for his own volition, to tie it more into the National Gaurd it was based on. This group of men often volunteer for service while maintaining positions in recruiting centers or public services (police/emergency or disaster services) located in their communities. 

I would like to say though since he has no definite lore behind his job at home (like how his wife has a degree for law) we can only assume he was still actively participating in his community and being a cop would suit someone with his accolades.

Edit: It would seem though a lack of background for his character besides his military involvement would be to allow the player to enact their own story as to how and why Nate was active in the first place, be it the draft or his own volition.

 Lore wise, at this point it'd be safe to assume he was just relaxing after returning home as the Liberation of Anchorage occured in January of 2077 and Nate would have only been home about 10 months. Enough time to catch up with his career-driven sweetheart and have a child together. 

This is a typical plot for men who have profound patriotism and chose to join the military after high school. They come home after earning their medals and start a family with their high school sweetheart. As the intro to FO4 mentions, Nate's grandfather served in wars past and he most likely followed family tradition."

Dreams are like our subconcious doesn't speak the same language as us and has to draw crazy pictures to tell us what it needs to relay. I believe our specific dream content has a lot to do with our daily struggle to maintain our disease and keep it from affecting others. I think this manifests in survival scenerios because much of our life involves making snap decisions on how we're going to keep our snap emotions from confirming our responses. Its like how someone needing to survive would be in a dangerous scenerio. I believe this is why you often experience wartime scenerios. It's the only thing cognitively that you connect with your day to day conflict. I'm a postapocalyptia fan and its terrible. These things often influence these types of dreams I have because that is what I cognitively recognize as similar to my own processes. 


Wish you luck with the meds friend! Keep a dream journal if you keep having reoccuring stuff like this just so you can clear it from your mind once you've woken. It's tough to go through a whole day drained from the traumas of your dreams and I've found this process helps with the tougher ones."
