Most of our stuff is bought, because I fervently believe creators ought to be compensated for their work - and it is work.
We also have a handful of pieces that are completely original - as in the whole thing is original, not just an original arrangement of someone else’s song; they’re actually our (my) original songs.
Were I to hear someone else singing them I’d be pissed. That’s my hours of work, and my creativity, stolen as far as I’m concerned.


No one ought to be just taking someone else’s creation (song or arrangement of), and using it/arranging it without permission (and compensating/crediting as required). Never mind whether the law prohibits it or not (it does btw), or whether any law is actually enforced or not, taking it is just theft I’m afraid.

I also have an experience as an adult that left me with ptsd. It was following this event that my ‘empathetic abilities’ seemed to ramp up a notch or 10!


I also have synesthesia, which I’m pretty sure factors in somewhere - I just haven’t managed to work out how.


I’m not sure about the psychic bit - although I do have two (possibly three), experiences that could potentially fall in to this category. I’ve just put it down to strong energy from someone, that I was able to perceive.

Empaths,f3ouwl4,t3_dhelj1,1571029525.0,"I’ve never actually told anyone and used the word ‘empath’.

My partner knows a lot about it though, because I’ve described what’s going on, but we just call it my ‘hinky sense’. We’d been together for 5 or so years before we had any kind of conversation about it though.

Everyone else I’m close to just thinks I’m sensitive to how they feel because I know them well, I’m a ‘good listener’ and I’m ‘good at reading people’. To be honest ‘reading people’ is what we do, we just don’t ‘read’ in the traditional sense.

Other than my partner, the only other person that knows the extent of what goes on with me is my hairdresser, and that’s only because of an incident that happened in the salon a while back that left me in a bit of an emotional state. I still didn’t say ‘empath’ though, I just described what was happening.

I’m actually quite comfortable not using the ‘empath’ word; those I’m close to know who I am, without me needing a label. This is probably because I’m not a big fan of labels of any description, and ‘empath’ is a label. I know this isn’t the way everyone feels though, and for many, being able to name something helps them to deal with it. That’s fine too - each to their own.

Not everyone understands what we do, so perhaps not using a label might work for you too. Be who you are, and talk about how you feel, and never deny yourself. You are special in many, many ways, and I’m sure your nearest and dearest already know that, and love you for it."

I have a photo of me and my ex that appears to have several orbs in it. My ex is convinced it’s their parents visiting (irrelevant reason for believing it’s parents). What is never considered is it was a damp night, which turned to light rain about 5 mins after the photo was taken.

There are ‘trails’ behind the ‘orbs’ that makes some of them appear to be moving upwards and sideways (My ex: rain doesn’t move like that, it comes downwards. Me: yeah but it’s so fine that it’s being moved by our movements/breath). One also appears to have a face in it when magnified (My ex: rain doesn’t have a face.

As this is an image that doesn’t seem to have an obvious rational explanation, and on the assumption that you are telling the truth (because I choose to believe most people aren’t lying for attention as is often assumed), maybe pay close attention to how your daughter reacts in her crib. You know her, and know what is ‘normal’ behaviour for her in her crib. Trust your maternal instincts; if she seems unusually upset or unsettled, or unusually happy and content, maybe consider that your daughter might have a visitor.
And if that appears to be the case, the next consideration is if this is a positive thing or not. Trust your instincts here too.

Most people that are alive would not harm or upset a child, so is there any reason to assume that changes due to death?
On the assumption that it is a visitor, this could just be someone who’s drawn to your baby for entirely wholesome reasons. It could even be someone you know who’s passed and is just checking in with the family.
As a sort-of-aside, and without going in to all the details, I’m fairly sure my Grandmother (who died while I was pregnant), checked in with my daughter when she was young. This was a good thing.
All that said, on the off-chance this is something negative, there are things you can do - cleansing, circles, prayer, whatever you feel is the best approach according to your beliefs. Just having a talk to it can help to."

As I understand it, consciousness and the physical body work in sync when we sleep. Sometimes they get out of sync; your consciousness is awake but your body is not.

For me, it usually happens when I’m overtired and stressed. Try and look at your sleep habits - you might be able to reduce the frequency of attacks.

If you’ve seen Homeland, Carrie’s character is the closest representation I’ve seen of how my brain works when manic.
It’s never let me down, and I wouldn’t change it for anything. And in fact, I tweak my meds to keep me a little manic a lot of the time, particularly when I have a professional situation that requires me to be on my A game (I wouldn’t recommend anyone just goes ahead and does this; I adjust my dosage myself as needed, but my care provider keeps a close eye that I don’t go too far).
I’ve tried to explain this before, and am often labelled with the ‘grandiose delusions’ tag. The only thing I can say is that I keep extensive notes on my thoughts/processes when I’m like this, and they all still make sense when I’m back on the level. Reading them back is the time when I get the ‘awestruck’ moments. My resulting professional achievements are tangible too."

2 professionals helped me a lot when I was in a similar situation:

Find a good funeral director; they will advise you what you need to do. Finding a good one is usually a word of mouth situation, but being 19 you may not know many people to ask. So, look in the obituary section of your local press (paper or online), and look for a firm that a lot of people use.

When you come to register his death (which the funeral director will tell you how to do), the registrar should be able to give you some information regarding how you go about starting to deal with his estate.

Both of these professionals deal with situations like yours all the time, and even if they don’t deal with what you need to do, they do know exactly what needs to be done and can point you in the right direction.

Regarding dealing with his estate, although the registrar should give you some advice on how to get started, there’s a really good article here - https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/guide-to-probate/

Although you may have to deal with the practicalities on your own, you shouldn’t do this unsupported; find someone you can talk to and lean on when things get tough."
cursedimages,esk8t4k,t1_ejp3wdb,1562055457.0,"Ooohhhh, I get it now.

I’ve always wondered why this was such a game changer. I know many, many people lost their lives that day, which of course is a terrible tragedy, but I never understood why the US made such a massive deal of it, like the world was ending and everyone was unsafe. For me, nothing much changed, and I couldn’t understand why it shattered the US to the extent it did.

I guess, having grown up in a big city in the UK, I’ve never truly experienced that feeling of untouchable invulnerability. I heard many stories of the blitz from my grandparents, and I grew up in the 70’s and 80’s, when the IRA were bombing the UK on a fairly regular basis.

I always knew on some level, I think, that being blown up by a terrorist organisation was just something that happened from time to time in the UK, but we got on with life regardless, and I guess many of us have grown up with an ‘eye out for the suspicious package’ mentality. This is our ‘normal’, and it’s been like that for 2 or 3 generations.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that for many of us in the UK, we never had our feelings of invincibility, of safety and security, ripped out from under us, because they were never 100% there to start with. For the US, it’s different, and that’s why I didn’t ‘get it’. Now I do."

However, her good behaviour was for no other reason than she wouldn’t ever be anything other than completely charming in front of people she doesn’t know well.
So, my solution was to invite her (bonus being that I didn’t have to explain her absence to anyone), but the day was structured in such a way that I was never alone with her, and she was always in earshot of someone she didn’t know well, so no opportunity for her to do what she does.
I kept her our of the planning too, and if she asked about details, big smile from me and ‘I want it to be a surprise!’ Obviously I has to tell her the venue ahead of time, but the criticism of that just got a smile and I didn’t bite.
If your parent is like my Mother, you can manage it if you think about how to plan that ahead of time.
