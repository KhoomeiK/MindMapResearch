Advice,fjif0we,t3_fdepwg,1583366204.0,"This sounds so stressful - I understand where you're coming from. Getting over exes, especially kind ones, can take a great deal of time.

Breakups can make us see our ex-partners as angels. I think the first thing is to remind yourself why you and him broke up. Try to remember the reasons why you wanted to break up in the first place, or why you felt being with him wasn't an option. 

I would also recommend taking time to pursue hobbies, or spend time with friends/family. Do things to remind yourself that there's more to life than him, and that the future you'd imagined isn't necessarily the only one. 

Lastly, be patient with yourself. These things take time, you don't need to push yourself to get over him. It will happen, it'll just take time."

questions,fgwapv4,t1_fgvdrzx,1581158966.0,"I'd love to know where you got your facts from. This is the first I'm hearing about masturbation being linked to prostate cancer. Masturbation can be addictive, just as anything else, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's to be avoided. You'd have to do it much more than the average person, and have an addictive personality, in order to become addicted to it. No-one I know is addicted to masturbation, and we're all pretty open about it.

You mention the origins of pornography. Sure, anything can look negative if you define it by its origins. But it's evolved since then, and a lot of people view it in a more positive light. For one, pornography can help people figure themselves out (including the person posting the image). I know I learned a lot more about my sexuality through pornography.

Lastly, you say it ruins job opportunities and relationships. You're saying that like one person in 500 exposes themselves on the internet. My friend and his girlfriend post pictures of themselves, and their parents are absolutely fine with it. People aren't  usually shunned out of society for showing themselves on the internet in an intimate way. Yes, some are, in some communities. Different cultures and communities have their own guidelines and preferences, but to say that masturbation and pornography are bad in general, as a sweeping statement, is just presumptuous."
