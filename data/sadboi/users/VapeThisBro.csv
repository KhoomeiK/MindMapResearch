There is 0 reason anyone would need to buy windows pro over home unless they are literally so lazy they can't be bothered to use the free antivirus security already included in windows and need extra security programs. You literally have not listen to a word I said while repeatly making false claims that show you don't know what your talking about. How can you claim to work with something for over 20 years and be making such blatant lies about it. Or is it that you have had 0 experience with windows outside of stuff from decades ago like XP and the like because what you are saying is absolutely not true about windows 10 and the ""versions "" of itself. You also ignored how Mac doesn't have server hosting OS like windows so how come that isn't included in your multiple versions argument? I'm not even here to argue which is better. I'm here because you are lying. You are trying to skew the perspective against windows to make it seem like it lacks functionality and you have to pay for more of it when it's is untrue.

They'll buy Windows Home assuming it will fit their needs and maybe a year or two down the road they need something that it can't do. That doesn't happen with macOS. Because there's only 1 version. macOS has a lot of functionality and headroom built into it.

your not listening to me, you are making the different versions of windows sound like they have much different functions than they do...windows pro only comes with extra antivirus programs...the only different windows version that is actually functionally different is the windows for servers...the ""functionalities"" that you say windows might possibly lack, are programs that you would have to still buy on mac also or use free alternatives like you mentioned...I get what you are saying about coming home to a computer that just works, i'm not arguing that there is a right or wrong between PC or Mac. I'm just as happy with my pc as you are your mac. What i'm telling you is you are painting Windows as something it isn't. Windows home is very much comparable to how Mac OS is set up and you are trying to make it seem like Windows pro is some a much more functional version when in reality it doesn't come with much more other than some antiviruses and access to Microsoft programs that don't come in the average office program setup like access. Lets not pretend that windows doesn't have those same native apps your talking about...I understand that apple has streamlined many things, I for one would use a mac for music making over a pc.

I understand the US military is in active conflict in other countries but that doesn't fit the definition of war to me even ignoring the other stuff. War in my mind, is a nation unleashing it's military power to defeat another faction. What we are doing in ALL of these countries is very restricted.

For example, this quote you grabbed from Cancer.net actually supports my argument because this does mean it increases your risk and is not guaranteed cancer. Why else do they start the sentence with SOMETIMES. 


And The CDC which you quote also goes on to say 
>There is no way to know which people who have HPV will develop cancer or other health problems. People with weakened immune systems (including individuals with HIV/AIDS) may be less able to fight off HPV and more likely to develop health problems from it.

This in combination with what the Cancer.org say with the whole you have to leave it untreated for years, means this is nowhere near comparable to covid like you want it to be."

My source this time is the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer), You keep driving home the point that you don't understand the concept of contagiousness, and don't understand the difference between increases risk verses causing something.

[First, it doesn't cause cancer. It increases risk.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1173172/). Moron, increasing your risk is not causing cancer


No you never said Cancer was contagious, but you were directly comparing Cancer to contagious diseases and asking why we don't stay home to rid ourselves of these diseases. Don't pretend its because I don't understand your words. Its you who forgot the context of the words you use.

Wrong, its  65k max, for the worst flus. But yes it could be avoided but the reason we don't avoid it, is because the flu is nowhere near as contagious as dieseases like sars, covid, or kansas flu


>Several common cancers are caused by infectious diseases moron.

Pointing out a few outlier cancers that are contagious doesn't mean cancer as a blanket term is contagious dipshit.. Dumbass doesn't know what outliers are. Just because you are an actual moron

Here is a quote from the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/is-cancer-contagious.html)

>Cancer is NOT contagious.
A healthy person cannot “catch” cancer from someone who has it. There is no evidence that close contact or things like sex, kissing, touching, sharing meals, or breathing the same air can spread cancer from one person to another.

>Cancer cells from one person are generally unable to live in the body of another healthy person. A healthy person’s immune system recognizes foreign cells and destroys them, including cancer cells from another person.

in fact, this is the only way cancer is contagious, 

>The only situation in which cancer can spread from one person to another is in the case of organ or tissue transplantation. A person who receives an organ or tissue from a donor who had cancer in the past may be at increased risk of developing a transplant-related cancer in the future. However, that risk is extremely low—about two cases of cancer per 10,000 organ transplants. Doctors avoid the use of organs or tissue from donors who have a history of cancer."

We don't stay home until we eradicate the flu because its less than a[ 5th of the contagious rate, while also being 1/20th as deadly?](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2019-coronavirus-is-20-times-deadlier-than-the-seasonal-flu-study). And Cancer isn't contagious?



> We don't outlaw alcohol or tobacco even though we know that that would save tens of thousands of lives.

We have literally tried before and the country turned on itself....

>You truly are a fucking idiot.


I didn't have to make up a statistic that 80-95 % of covid infected won't have symptoms. The only numbers I can see related to people who don't show symptoms is 6%. How did you turn 6 into 95? How am I the idiot when you turned 6 into 95% Or is it that you are really the idiot because you have been ignoring how asymptomatic people still spread corona and that we have 0 ways to prevent the spread while you are asymptomatic? In fact, if you paid attention at all, Corona is mainly spread by Asymtomatic people before their symptoms occur as late as 3 weeks later. The diesease is literally asymtomatic for most of its time infecting you but you want to pretend that most people will have no symptoms. You really don't know anything about covid do you"
