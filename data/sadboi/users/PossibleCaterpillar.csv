gatekeeping,fmce28t,t1_fmc1ode,1585943883.0,I think you misunderstand- non gay people are more than welcome at gay bars- they’re just more focused towards gay people so they can meet people like them. But if you are straight you are more than welcome to go to one :) it’s just like at pride parades- even if you are just a supporter and not a part of the community you are welcome because it is all about being proud of who you are no matter your gender/sexuality. I hope that clears things up for you :)
gatekeeping,fmbzcpu,t1_fmbxii0,1585936004.0,"No it’s not that- it’s that people can meet people who are similar to them, for example if you are gay and you go to a gay bar you can not only meet other gays, but potentially meet a partner. It’s a lot easier to go to these places since the dating pool for lgbt people is a lot smaller than for straight people. It’s also to say a place where these people will feel safe, as some people experience a lot of discrimination still, and need a place to feel accepted. I hope this explains it :)"
