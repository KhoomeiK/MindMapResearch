Isn't it only an ad, if there is a citation that it is paid for by the campaign of Bernie Sanders?  Wouldn't the ending have Bernie voicing his approval?  The last I read, Bernie's campaign was weighing whether or not to continue to be highly critical of Joe due to the *chance* it could be more harmful then helpful.

SandersForPresident,fkmjysi,t1_fkmizcl,1584330946.0,"I personally view what is central to this is that his support is based on fear.  Fear of a Trump re-election.  What is representative of this is the exit polling.  It's insane, all of the exit polling *proves* a majority of these voters support Bernie's policies and plans.  Bernie has echoed such an analysis of these results.  

As well as low voter turnout.  Boomers like Joe, literally everyone who isn't a boomer doesn't so much.  

Majority of the African American vote backs Joe.  May want to tread carefully in speculating this, but his Vice Presidency in the administration he was in may shed a light on this. 

Moving forward now with these things in mind, can highlight what makes Bernie a stronger candidate, Joe a weaker one, encourage and help every young person vote, and exchange ideas and views with a Biden supporter."

I think is possible, not factual that you know more about certain things than I do, that if you shared with me, would help me become better informed and vice versa.  Or maybe not, I don't know.  That's what makes discussion important and productive though.  

Just to contrast our views a tad more, I agree rage toward the system that created Trump is warranted, even more so than at Trump.  But, I would disagree that none is warranted at Trump.  I also agree that Joe cannot be trusted to do it, and if he were to do anything effective it would likely not be enough.

For every movement in this country, progress has not happened quickly it has taken time.  We have made hugely significant progress in this movement and will continue to.

My core disagreement here is that *IF* it came to this point, and Joe was the nominee that it was deliver a severe blunt to the damage that another four years of Donald Trump would bring.  Furthermore, this movement would continue and Bernie would continue to push to bring the change that is necessary.  I am optimistic that we would get more done that it is difficult to imagine getting done in a Biden administration than another Trump administration.  

I believe that your view hinders a bright future that you feel supportive of and that is entirely possible.  As I've noted in previous dialogue here, Bernie has been very clear that he does not accept and discourages this kind of ""support.""

Stay informed, stay open minded, have considerate, kind, yet firm discussions and take care of yourself.  <3

Polls are actually accurate the majority of the time, but assumptions shouldn't be made on them.  Polls weren't in Trump's favor, they most recently were in Bernie's favor, not Joe's.  Events changed, as they are constantly and oftentimes overnight.

It's vital to stay informed, give Bernie financial support if and when you can, textbank, phonebank from home.  Talk to your friends, family.. 

My personal advice is through more logic and reasoning with limited emotion and no insulting Joe and anyone who doesn't support Bernie.  That is not said with an assumption, but it is a reasonable suggestion to *some* fellow brothers and sisters who are in our movement as it only hurts and is counterproductive to literally everyone and everything."

I have developed a friendship with them, it just feels like that she be grounded, if that makes sense.  As, I would see meeting her husband as extending a friendship further showing it's strength and validity, that it has gotten to a point to where it is significant enough, and you feel close to this other person to be involved in their life to that extent. 

Rather than what seems to me to be meeting their partner out of some sense of obligation and can be understood as seeking for approval?  I can be corrected on that, but that's why or partially why I feel that way about it.  

Platonically, I am open to and also search for it, when it is right and organic, basically as close as you can be to someone without it being romantic if that makes sense.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but I also think that's a bit controversial.  Some people may not know what I mean by that or consider it to be more relative.

I only want that though if I naturally feel it for someone and it's mutual though.  What I am uncomfortable with is anything sexual at all, or someone having romantic intentions, acting on them, without communicating any of it.

What would put me at ease is to know exactly what she is looking for and would like to have in a relationship with me and if there are bounds what would they be, as it seems so far there aren't many."

My thought to emphasizing that I am seeking a friendship is that, specifically in platonic friendships, I can intentionally be very engaging and invest into them, while trying to gauge the appropriate and mutual level to meet that at.  I have always tried to consistently talk to any significant friendships I have, regularly schedule time to spend together, and look for ways to deepen and strengthen the friendships that I have. 

I do have the concern that that can come as of as being romantically inclined, but it feels natural and I honestly don't feel anything other than platonic feelings when I treat others this way.

I also feel that she has initiated much of what has happened herself thus far, as far as talking to me in the first place, asking to hang out, hugging me, and having a rather intimate conversation and moment together as we have.  I have just been receptive to it"

I hate to think that it can possibly happen with a new friend, but it's happened a few times with different people in the past.  

I'm curious about kissing hello/goodbye, as done in France?  lol.  I had an inkling to what you make of the leg touch, *maaaybe* the hand squeeze, but I don't know if that's overthinking.  Honestly, I have only ever been uncomfortable when something is overtly sexual.  I think human touch is important, necessary and a good thing with the right motives to it. 

I have learned my lesson with the previous relationship, and I always question myself if it's wrong but I'm very selective in making friends.

I honestly feel that this is moving a bit fast from her end, but I am open to meeting her where she is or if she has a goal with me, then I may be interested in reaching the same goal.  I'm definitely trying to follow the advice you're giving, I just don't know how well I'm doing.  She is a customer to where I work if that provides a clarification.  

Unless I'm mistaken, I understood it to be organic and reciprocal.  What is not organic and reciprocal, is that I am trying to understand where she in how she feels toward me as a friend, because I don't feel I can tell, and she seems confused every time I try to verbalize that."
