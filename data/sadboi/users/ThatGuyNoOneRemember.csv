gaming,fr1l1kg,t1_fr1i3gc,1589821571.0,"You had one response, that sounded anything but bitter. Xbox coming out one generation after Playstation has nothing to do with the naming convention. If that were the case, then Playstation, which came out two generations after Nintendo, should had been called Playstation 3 because it was competing with the N64–the successor of the Super Nintendo which is a successor of the NES. 

As far as I’ve seen, there aren’t “fanboys” here. Besides you, maybe. Nice try with the trolling."
gaming,fr1kefq,t1_fr1grru,1589821248.0,"But it’s still a dumb name, though. Microsoft should have just called it Xbox Scarlett or give it a name that made sense. Xbox Series X will confuse people. It shouldn’t, but it will.

I still think Hasbro should have pulled out six years ago, and now with no progress this should be obvious to Hasbro."
TheHubNetwork,fqtqp4z,t3_gkveie,1589644234.0,"Yeah, Discovery Family Channel has gotten worse since it first aired back in late 2014. (RIP The Hub). But at this point I’m surprised Hasbro even bothers to put anything on that channel. It’s pretty much a paper weight write off. 

I’m more certain now than ever that Hasbro will pull out and not renew their contract. It’s almost been 10 years. And I believe the contract has to be renewed every 10 years. The last time Hasbro did this was in 2010 or 2011? I know there’s some articles online that have more details on this. Anyway, with everything going to streaming services and Hasbro now owning EntertainmentOne and Saban’s brands, they’ll go this route. Hanazuki aired on YouTube and they have a Magic the Gathering show being worked on for Netflix as well. Plus most of their shows air on streaming services. Hasbro would be crazy to let this opportunity pass. They own Power Rangers, Peppa Pig, Transformers and have rights to other shows now (thanks to the acquisition of EntertainmentOne and Saban’s Brands). This is free marketing and exposure of their products to a new audience. 

I still occasionally watch Discovery Family channel, mostly from like 2 am up to 5 am when they air non-My Little Pony cartoons. But, yeah, Discovery really screwed up the network."
