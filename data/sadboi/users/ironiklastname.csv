psychologystudents,fbebiwx,t3_ecw0cb,1576782414.0,"I can only speak from my experience so it may differ from others. I'm in a Masters of Counselling program in Canada.

Be prepared to reflect often about your behaviours and thoughts regarding your own and others' prejudices, assumptions, culture, beliefs, values, etc. Majority of assignments will focus on insights about yourself. Introspection is a valuable asset. 

Be open to making mistakes. Mistakes are wonderful! They always give you fodder to grow from. For instance, watching yourself try to conduct therapy for the first time is cringe worthy and awkward. The outcome is that you'll see what you do well and not so well, and learn from it every time!

You never fully feel like you are a therapist, so begin to get comfortable with feeling uncertain and uncomfortable. Imposter syndrome can run rampant in therapists. Conducting therapy is a process; there is never an end goal or enough education that conveys ""Congrats! NOW you're a therapist!"". As well, you won't be some clients' cup of tea nor will you have all the knowledge to help all presenting problems. And that's okay!! 

Lastly, I strongly advise incorporating self-care into your routine if you don't already. Do whatever helps you feel grounded and healthy and do it every day. Schedule it into your day and commit. This is so crucial that it is stated as part of our ethical obligations. Also, it's greatly beneficial to see a therapist yourself to avoid projecting your own difficulties in sessions and for general self-care.

I hope these comments help!"
