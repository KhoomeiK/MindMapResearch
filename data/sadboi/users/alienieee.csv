(not only would you still have your dominant hand unaffected) your language center might be on your right side and speech would have also been (likely) unaffected. Another weird brain fact that I love! If you’re right handed, typically your language center is on your left temporal lobe. If you’re left handed it’s typically on your right."

migraine,fne505s,t1_fndzoed,1586883165.0,"Yep... agreed. It made the migraines worse because I was so stressed out in college not remembering anything. It got to the point where I couldn’t even have a conversation. I kept telling my parents, it’s like the words just don’t come out anymore. I was doing research on a test that assesses word finding at the time, and convinced myself it was all in my head. Finally looked it up and boom - speech and language difficulties listed as a side effect. I was livid at my neurologist for only mentioning “soda might taste different.” It got better but I don’t think I’ll ever have the ability I did before which I still haven’t gotten over. I now research every medication before going on it. Ugh... like you said, fuck that drug"
migraine,fndxbz4,t1_fndvbsx,1586879231.0,"Aphasia is the blanket term for loss of ability to understand or to express language. 

Anomia is a symptom of aphasia, which is specifically difficulty with word finding. 

The person you’re talking about had Brocca’s aphasia which generally means they can understand what you’re saying fairly well, but when they try to talk, they can’t get the words out. The opposite is Wernicke's aphasia, where they have difficulty understanding not only what you are saying, but also what’s coming out of their mouth. So when they mean to say chair, door knob comes out instead. 

I’m a speech pathologist who also was on Topamax and had anomia! And I get it with migraines too, it’s the worst! I work with stroke patients now though, so I think I have slightly more empathy than others when they’re struggling with word finding."

AmItheAsshole,fbe0o1m,t1_fbdy5g5,1576775575.0,"Im a speech pathologist working on cognition with dementia patients. It is 100% possible for dementia to progress slowly over 4 years. Happens all the time. It is also a really common response for family to laugh and ignore, because calling it what it is is sad, especially when it happens so often. Making light of it is easier.  Calling the person out every time they have a memory slip makes them embarrassed and if they have a lot of pride and are in denial about the problem (which is especially common in old white men) it can make them angry and offended."
