Try a different comvience store. You're getting jacked."

Why specifically did they buy up toilet paper? Because they are morons."
TherapeuticKetamine,fkkklf9,t3_fiv2oq,1584286148.0,Would be interesting in reading about the whole journey to see how your experinces goes. Keep us posted if you have time.
Ayahuasca,fkha498,t1_fkh3r0m,1584193474.0,Agreed. It is so friggin irresponsible of governments to not be fast tracking all psychadelics research as they have with Ketamine and now MDMA.
ELATeachers,fkg3kpk,t1_fkcoi4s,1584149092.0,"I recommend the tv show ""Big Mouth"""

Ayahuasca,fkg0jgu,t3_fhv3ng,1584146963.0,"Well done. Was a paotive video without being too far out. Lol
Glad for you.!"
Ayahuasca,fkg02c0,t1_fkfhi8q,1584146631.0,"Maybe something good comes of this whole thing. We pull out of the  rat-race for a bit and recoonnect with what matters. Stop the petty right vs left bs. 

Or im dreaming....lol"
TherapeuticKetamine,fkfzmhb,t1_fkdc4la,1584146327.0,"Interesting that you say depression is alleviated but you're not confident hypomania is reduced.  
Are you on meds to manage hypomania?"
TherapeuticKetamine,fkfza3x,t1_fkdepc6,1584146091.0,"Awsome. 10 months seems like mana from heaven to me. I guess it's all relative but if a few grand can give you functional happiness for 10 minths, it seems well worth it. Hope you feel the same."
TherapeuticKetamine,fkfz3x4,t1_fkdf5pk,1584145972.0,Wow. Impressive.  6 initual within 2 weeks sounds agressive (though I have no experience to base that opinion on).  Glad to see it was effective.
Ayahuasca,fkfyuvg,t1_fke1jvw,1584145803.0,Have you listened to this man's thoughts on why some formulations of AYA are triggers for mania and others are not?   https://youtu.be/BtWKrGYsB3I
TherapeuticKetamine,fkfynrm,t1_fke3ko6,1584145669.0,"Ok. Interesting. Seems alot of people find 3 months is a limit for them. 

Do you excercise regular and have regular sleep patterns?"
TherapeuticKetamine,fkfxgap,t1_fkf4d3h,1584144851.0,Yes that seems to be the issue. Meds keep mania in check but make u miserable instead. Glad to hear ketamine was a partial fix for you.
TherapeuticKetamine,fkfx3dw,t1_fkfnyj6,1584144607.0,Ok. Glad to see it is working. Feeling encouraged.
TherapeuticKetamine,fkfx0cg,t1_fkfrn8w,1584144550.0,Thats amazing. So glad to hear it!

Ayahuasca,fkd2r0u,t1_fcmns7i,1584066944.0,"If the psychiatrist determines your life is at a point where you have literally nothing to lose and are at high risk of suicide, he might very well support the use of psychadelics in a planned and coordinated fashion. He won't likely ""recommend"" it but if you're determined to try something , he/she may support you. 

I figure, so long as you are prepared to utilize an antipsychotic if you are manic after the ceremony, then you should be able to be brought under control fairly quickly. No?"
Ayahuasca,fkd1npp,t1_fcmf4tw,1584066201.0,Can you give me contact details. I'm looking for conection to an experience/church like yours in North America. Bipolar II but prepared to do things safely and with psychiatric guidance.
Ayahuasca,fkd0qfh,t1_fckl7xu,1584065581.0,"This doctoral researcher with Bipolar II has theories on why certain Ayahuasca formulations trigger mania while others do not.
