I’ve had blood work and everything and I have anxiety and depression as well and adhd and take meds but I’ve been this way since high school, I’m 26 now also around the same height and weight as you.

mentalillness,foo6xbb,t3_g8e5ze,1587933689.0,"I live in southern wv, I know how you feel. It’s hard to get help around here. You need to demand a psychological evaluation. You take tests and an iq test and a psych will evaluate you. I have a strong feeling you have depersonalization/derealization and maybe you’re in a huge hole thinking about it and psyching yourself out. Don’t research too much. You’ll be fine I promise."

Unfortunately I’m lactose intolerant and mainly vegetarian (I hate the texture and taste of meat) I think that’s why it’s been so hard for me to gain weight. Also I have adhd and I honestly forget to eat sometimes. I’ve been tracking my food and it’s actually so difficult for me to meet goal. I’m trying to do 2000 calories a day. Yesterday all I ate was a BLT and eggs and rice just because I really didn’t feel hungry. If I eat so much I’m miserable. 

Also I’d love not to have skinny arms and legs lol. I try to workout but I get bored."

It sucks because I have so many allergies and plus I’m mostly vegetarian so I’m limited on what I can eat. I think that’s why I never gain weight. I’m glad you can relate. 

I know it’s a sensitive subject and I don’t want to be like ungrateful or something about my weight but it really does suck sometimes. I literally have people making fun of me till this day. Maybe I’m just taking everyone the wrong way."

I felt that anxiety was more major for me so I was put on Prozac but now having a diagnosis of adhd (which I really always knew I had) I’m just nervous what they’ll put me on because I don’t think I can take adhd meds with Prozac. 

I understand how you’re feeling through this time. I feel like I’m in North Korea or something. Like not able to do anything. I hate it."

Cooked Chickpeas, Water, Tahini (Ground Sesame), NonGMO Soybean Oil, Garlic, Salt, NonGMO Citric Acid, Red Bell Pepper, Potassium Sorbate Added To Maintain Freshness, Spices

I usually eat cereal, eggs, yogurt with granola and berries or avocado toast in the morning. I’d say most the time I skip lunch and just snack on random things throughout the day like fruit or veggies or chips, something like that. For dinner I’ll have like beans and rice in some fashion, veggie burger, or a pasta dish.

I looked up how much protein I should have and it’s like 46 grams. All the stuff that I eat I read the nutrition facts and it seems like there’s not enough protein."
