boston,faglcqw,t3_e93prd,1576061314.0,"Do you already have relationships with doctors? If so, go with that ACO. If not, make sure you can get in with doctors in the ACO you want before you officially select it. For example, don't choose the Partners ACO until you're sure you can get a Partners primary care doc. 

When I was on MassHealth (although I'm not any more), I chose the Partners ACO as all of my docs are at Mass General. I reviewed the various plans and for the most part, they were pretty similar in terms of benefits. 

I have a job now and thus have health care through my employer, but man, do I miss the $0 MassHealth co-pays."
