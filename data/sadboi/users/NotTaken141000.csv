BPD,fqz94pv,t3_glq2lx,1589762480.0,Look at the facts and only the facts. Any assumptions made are invalid and (most likely) wrong. Your feelings are always valid but I get your point. It’s a difficult one that usually passes with time (for me) don’t overthink it if you can help it. What do you actually mean by triggers you?
BPD,fqz8fpg,t3_glqn9b,1589762058.0,"Why not? You said it yourself, we are complex bacteria that shouldn’t be alive but it is what it is and we have emotion that we have to deal with (and you have.. for decades) I am not saying you are gonna find the answers for the universe, but for majority of them, you can answer yourself if you would like.
Everyone says they live life with regret, how can you regret something that’s not even happened yet? You have to do things in life, you can try and settle but if your miserable then trust me, you will never settle, you can’t stop moving when your upset, that’s the good thing about it, forces you to make change. 
You will not care about these questions when you are living a happy and fulfilling life, change your attitude, “what’s the point in living” fuck knows but what’s the point in living miserably? Your purpose is something you have to find. Always DO what is hard because then nothing WILL be hard anymore. Your accomplishments and goals are your purpose and will never leave you with what’s the point questions. Trying to help. I know it ain’t easy but outlook is fucking everything."
