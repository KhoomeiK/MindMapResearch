I'm a piercer and I've had 4 total (2 in my chest that are gone, 2 still in my face for years now) and I don't have a count of how many I've done.

But for myself and most clients, it's not nearly as bad as you think it'll be. And with the right aftercare, healing is a breeze. Of course the outcome all counts on a reputable piercer and good aftercare practices."

With that said, you may ruffle some feathers if you get this done because of that reason. Everyone in this world is living a different truth; each in our own complex minds and worlds, vastly different. Some people will really love your hair and tell you so. Some people will take offense to your hair and also, inform you. Its up to you to decide what you're prepared to do within your own comfort zone.

Side note: yes, braids ARE found in MANY cultures but without certain hair types (no clue your texture, etc), they often don't hold up well and can cause other issues like losing hair and so on."

It's one thing to discuss boundaries and come to a mutual agreement on an open relationship. It's an entirely different thing to CHEAT on your partner and that's what she did. She wanted to open the relationship so she could continue having sex with another man guilt free. 

THREE YEARS she's been doing this and lying to you. I don't know how you'd ever be able to trust her again and there's no good relationship without trust.

I'm sorry this happened to you, OP. Best of luck."

1. He wants the extra money that comes with gaining a spouse that the military provides. Super slimy reason, imo but a common one.

2. He gets overly attached easily due to anxieties surrounding his service, possible deployments, the ""will anyone care when I'm gone?"" mentality.

3. He's watching a lot of his battle buddies do the same exact thing while talking about how great it is (newlywed honeymoon phase annnnnd the money) and he's overly eager to have it for himself.

Whatever his reasons, this is all red flags. Hopefully your friend will take off the rose colored glasses before a bigger mistake happens (if he lets the relationship make it that far).

Regardless of what your friend decides, stay by her side and support her. She will inevitably need you to be there to not tell her 'I told you so' when it all falls apart."

Permanently altering another person's body without their consent is gross. I have been a professional piercer for years and have always outright refused to pierce infants. Other than the obvious pain and discomfort, infections can happen and are more likely with an infant grabbing their ears with grimey hands. The piercings themselves will likely shift and be very uneven in the future and something that cannot be fixed without more invasive procedures. Many parents often go to mall kiosks or Claire's where there are ZERO health and sanitation procedures to protect against blood borne pathogens. The workers watch a 30 minute video and then use extremely unsanitary, damaging piercing guns (if she decides to get her pierced regardless, PLEASE make sure she at least knows to go to a professional).

These are just a few of the MANY reasons not to get an infant pierced but try to appeal to her by saying, ""Wouldn't it be a much more positive experience if you take her to get them pierced when she decides she's ready?"" I love to see interactions between kids and their parents at such a vulnerable moment. Its a big decision to get a piercing and these kids often leave feeling empowered and more grown up and have more respect for their parents who let them decide something so major.

Again, you're so NTA, OP. Good luck."

Its going to hurt but you need to reach out to friends, family, co-workers, anyone to be with you.

Human beings are incredibly insecure about most things. Having a visual lineup of your past relationships doesn't allow your current relationship to grow into its own thing. Its being influenced by your exes and your gf is comparing herself to them. 

I don't think this is just her being insecure/lacking self confidence. You mentioned her finding out that this ex, that you still talk to regularly, is essentially your dream girl. OUCH. I can't imagine what that feels like for her. I'm a 29f and that would definitely crush me, even with the confidence I've built up over the years.

You're allowed to have friends because that's what healthy relationships include but not only is she most likely struggling with feeling absolutely inadequate, you still mention this particular ex in everyday conversation. You have to know that it hurts her since you seem very perceptive and yet... you do it anyways. She doesn't need to know the funny thing E sent or said or did. Keep your friendship but keep it respectful and build your gf up instead of giving her reminders that E is some kind of ""dream girl""."
