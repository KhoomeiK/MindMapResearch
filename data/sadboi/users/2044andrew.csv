depression,fh6q00x,t3_f1djgl,1581303264.0,"absolutely brother. I feel like after years of being sad, I worked to convince myself that being sad is a good thing, so I gravitate towards it. I enjoy struggle."
depression,fgnkw2h,t1_fgne9bl,1580947019.0,"yea there are brief moments of satisfaction for me too. used to be more, but there still are some. less and less. the tiniest things can just make me happy and I remember many of them. im managing, obviously because im still alive. but I dont know how long I want to live if im just getting by, you know? if this continues for years then im blowing my brains out probably before I reach thirty. a lot of times I think probably before I reach twenty five or younger. hardly anything makes me want to stay alive.

anyway. fun fact about me: I went to college for three days. yup. three days haha. first night I was crying silently in my bed while my roommate slept because I was already so overwhelmed with campus life and on the first day of classes I left. never attended one"
depression,fgmdlhm,t1_fgl7q4s,1580922504.0,"well I feel like shit every day and I see nothing to look forward to. when I was younger I wanted to do so much more and the world seemed so big but now everything looks so small and like there is nothing, no hope. its like everything shrunk and turned gray.
why I feel this way I dont know. been telling myself for years that I'd end up similar to how I am now; I knew this was going to happen. 
right now I work around twenty hours a week at a restaurant, could change to thirty or forty hours soon. my first job ever and im 21, before that my social anxiety and excuses were too great. Ive failed my drivers test three times and I have no desire to take it again so I take a bus to work and my mother picks me up at night. when im free, I write. writing has been my safe haven and my drug for the past three years. but im lacking the motivation now and im hardly even reading anymore so its getting harder. what else. ive been on medication for over three years. uhhh yea I dont know what else to say"
depression,f65wjxx,t3_dqh5d3,1572705862.0,"try your best to stay strong brother. know that there are loads of people here that will help you with your suffering. keep fighting man; maintain the belief that there will eventually be light that comes to illuminate the darkness. that's how I keep going. 

I believe in you. you'll be okay."
