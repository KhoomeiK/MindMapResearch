I avoided therapy for years in part because of out of pocket costs. It cost me jobs and landed me in the hospital with a diagnosis - and as soon as I got out I had debt collectors calling me for bills I didn't know I had that were beyond what I could afford as a college student. 

Other candidates support medicare expansion, mental health parity, etc, but these proposals DO NOT HELP ALL OF US if health insurance companies can blatantly ignore parity on non marketplace (government) plans and if medicare does not include comprehensive coverage for mental health. 

We won't benefit from more stop gap measures or expansions with asterisks. We need SINGLE PAYER."

BipolarReddit,eyrhbli,t3_cxluks,1567368631.0,"I didn't see the movie but I found the second article very compelling. It's unfortunate that psychotic illness is still too taboo and scary at a time when depression and anxiety are becoming more understood and accepted. My episodes have all been very public affairs thanks to social media and it's alienated a lot of people. I just feel uncomfortable around acquaintances knowing that despite a polite smile or wave they might see me as a threat. 

(TW: police) When my roommate with bipolar locked himself in his room during a mixed episode, another roommate called the police (he did not know about his diagnosis at the time and was acting with misguided goodwill). The police department came in force that night with SWAT gear, a battering ram, and some asshole in military getup and an AR. They escalated the situation and it turned into a 3 hour affair. I remember them laughing and being chummy like they were soldiers in war claiming a trophy after they dragged him out. People have been killed by police because of this stereotype, thank god he was not harmed physically. The medical rhetoric of being labelled a 'danger to yourself and others' is just fucked.

It's incredibly irresponsible that the director has done this, and ironic that he has made public comment about a family member's experiences with mental illness. I get the sense that he feels victimized by it."

totalwar,eyrbrlx,t3_cy9t2d,1567364632.0,"I don't have a story quite as detailed as that, but I've always had a lot of fun trying to play 'history-enforcer' with Great Britain in Empire. The challenge of maintaining the appropriate alliances (while sometimes frustrating with the AI) and engineering global politics is somehow entertaining to me and makes GB more interesting to play. It's exciting supporting the Mughals early on against the Marathas to establish a strong trading partner only to pick them apart at mid-century - a tragic point in history to be sure.\* 

I still can't figure out a way to get the Iroquois to play ball. Fucking colonists won't leave them alone. 

In my last campaign I had a hell of a time trying to keep Portugal relevant. After losing Goa and facing pressure from Spain, the Portuguese accepted protectorate status early in the campaign (a feat that is sadly more memorable than any battle I've ever won in a total war game given how much Dagestan loooooves protecting people). While landing troops in Portugal and taking Gibraltar at the outset of the War of Spanish Succession, I sent a small but elite force of East India Company soldiers from Bengal (Darthmod) to recapture Goa from the Marathas. Taking the small region was easy with superior arms technology, and I immediately returned the colony to Portugal as a sign of good faith. The EIC force remained stationed there as a base of operations to harass the Marathas, but in doing so I neglected the defense of Bengal, an easy target for the French in Cuttack. To my dismay France had quietly amassed a sizable and well-equipped force and set out to capture the seat of British power in India. While frantically churning out sepoys, I immediately diverted the bulk of the force in Goa back to Bengal while sending the Mughals aid and arms technology to hopefully keep the Marathas out of Goa. 

In the meantime, my only advantage against the French advance on Bengal was the harsh jungle terrain they would have to cross in their approach (sometimes it pays not to build roads on turn 1). Without a fort in Bengal I had little hope of holding the settlement against a siege from a larger and better-equipped army, and it seemed despite the terrain that the French would arrive before the cavalry showed up from Goa. To slow their approach, I sallied my small but mighty sepoy army to prepare an ambush and await the French forces. Additionally, I trained and transported a general and sent him by sea to harass French assets in their colony. This ruse saved Bengal, as after a Pyrrhic victory for the French against my ambush they diverted their forces back to stop my raiding party. The cavalry showed up, occupied Cuttack, and I was able to sue for peace with France using the territory as a bargaining chip. 

\* I think those of us who play Empire/Napoleon religiously all dream for an Empire II spanning a larger map and perhaps the 19th century as well (I love Napoleon but find it harder to stay invested in the limited setting when the world is calling in Empire). That said, I question whether such a game would be palatable today when there are safer and more profitable options that don't involve reconciling things like slavery, colonialism, and imperialism within game mechanics. That said, I don't think the spirit of such a game would have to necessarily be exploitative. I'd love to play as Ethiopia and recreate the battle of Adwa, send Italy packing, and then go open up a can of whoopass and colonize Sicily with the support of my Russian alliance. My biggest problem with empire is that 'defensive westernization' isn't really an option for the non-European factions - something that makes Shogun II FOTS really stand out to me. Or rather, they play the same way as the European factions, just with fewer military options. What's with the massive Huron field armies that keep attacking me only to be cut down by 3 units of Hessians and a cannon?! Empire could be a much better game with some mechanics from more recent total wars imported in, but I don't know if we'll ever see it."
