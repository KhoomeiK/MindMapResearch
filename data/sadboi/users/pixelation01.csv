Currently, my AM routine is nuetrogena salicylic cream cleanser, Thayers witch hazel, & Biores watery essence SPF. I don‚Äôt use moisturizer in the daytime because my skin is extremely oily & so my natural oils build up throughout the day

My PM routine is cleansing with nuetrogena salicylic cream cleanser, followed by stridex in the red jar,  TOs niacinamide, & Paula‚Äôs Choice glycolic Acid skin perfecting AHA gel. I moisturize with Aveenos daily moisturizing lotion."
