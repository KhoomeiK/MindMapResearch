Is there a will? Are there other family to include in this process.

I believe in a cycle of life and death. I have always accepted the fact that I will one day die. But I still care about the ones I love and want them to live long and happy lives. I also believe that the ones you love live on in the ones you leave behind.

I can see the love of my wife in my two boys. Her goodness and light shines right out of them. I also feel her presence in myself and others that loved her so deeply. I know I will never hold her again or be with her but she is inside me and in my boys by becoming part of us."

All losses are unique and all widowers experience their loss differently but. ..  you are right losing someone to suicide is different. There are the lingering questions. Why did they do it? How could they do it? How could this happen? what could I have done? But they loved me so much etc etc.  It is different.

In some ways the Covid-19 has not bothered me much as my grieving already had me in a state of isolation. But it has been good for me to meet others who are going through the same things that we all are losing our mates. We can prop each other up. Listen to each other. Hear each others stories.

But chances are there are people around you that may be able to relate to you and will be willing to talk. At least there are people here who will talk and are going though a loss that is not the same but is in the same general ballpark.
widowers,fje7zn7,t3_fczwx2,1583266801.0,You sound to me like you loved him enough. There is so much longing and love in your post I can feel it. My wife died 2 months ago and my heart aches to have her back.

I gonna have to rewatch soon with my kids."
SuicideBereavement,fjdz8zr,t3_fcxtrh,1583262119.0,"How old are you? Often younger people may have not had any exposure to death at all.

People in general have a lot of trouble facing death. People have even more trouble facing the death by Suicide. The reality is everyone will die eventually and it's better to develop a positive attitude towards death is it something we all must accept at some point.
When something like this happens you find out who your friends really are.
My wife 21 years died December 26th from her depression. Both of her sisters also died the same way 20 years ago. I don't know what it's like to lose a sibling like this but I do know what it's like to lose people you love like this. I'd be happy to chat with you feel free to PM me.

This is still so fresh for you. The grief never goes away your love for your sibling will never go away but you can learn to live with this. I hope you get some healing soon. Lots of love"
mentalillness,fjdoda8,t3_fcxalm,1583256080.0,It is not uncommon to be obsessive about events in your past. Talking to someone might help you with this. It sounds like you are concerned about it which tell me that talking to someone is a good idea. I'm not sure a psychiatrist is the right person but they could be. There may be other people you can reach out too like help lines or other family you trust. I think it is good you are expressing yourself and reaching out here.
widowers,fjdnput,t3_fcnaao,1583255760.0,"As you state everyone processes grief differently. It may be hard not to feel guilty but there is no need to. Perhaps this is easier said than done.

I think doing what feels right and good it the path to follow.
I hope you get some healing soon."
progrockmusic,fjdml2y,t3_fcwrkp,1583255411.0,"Pink Floyd Animals is often overlooked and it is very good. It was the first recording I purchased when Cds became a thing. I listened to it the whole night in repeat awake and asleep.

widowers,fjc3oqr,t1_fjc2g6r,1583207801.0,I hope so. I'm trying. I'll PM you at some point. Thanks for the offer.
widowers,fjbp9u1,t1_fjbcxpv,1583198425.0,The day after she died we all said to each other that we need to be open and honest and talk about things. We've kept it pretty open dialog going with each other. Each of them have their own therapist and I have mine. We also need together with a couple of other survivors as a family. These family sessions have been really good and the people we are working with have been amazing listeners. My mother-in-law has been joining us for these sessions. She's lost three daughters to mental illness that's great for her to have a place that she can talk and be listened to. We're trying to take care of each other. With the history in my wife's family were even worried about a genetic component as well.
widowers,fjb89ah,t1_fjakn4l,1583188463.0,"Is it worth reaching out to your friends in another city? I've been using whatsapp to talk to family and friends all over the place. It's nice to be able to see them in chat with them at the same time. It really helps to have people to be able to stay in touch with.
It is such a hard thing to go through but we all need to learn to do it as everybody eventually dies."

widowers,fjaw8cv,t3_d1ohv5,1583181794.0,"I can relate to this. I had friends that have been ignoring me for years now reach out and want to talk to me. A lot of it is about their guilt for treating you so shity over the years. Some people are there just for their own grief not for yours. I think you should avoid these people at all costs. I call them DRAINOS. Because they drain out anything good left in you.

Watch out its a DRAINO!!!"
SuicideWatch,fjavhj6,t1_fj8en67,1583181385.0,"Thanks for your reply and the clarification. That makes sense what you say about this being a safe place for peer support. I'll look for other places to discuss activism.

I prefer to say my wife ""died from depression"" rather than she died by Suicide. The word suicide literally means self kill and this is not what happened to my wife as well as many others who died from mental illness. It was The Depression that killed her. When someone dies from cancer we say they ""died from cancer"" the final cause of their deaths is often not that cancer but complications from the condition. When someone dies from AIDS it is the diseases that they get from their compromised immune system that kill them but we still say they ""died from AIDS"""
widowers,fja85bi,t1_fj9lrwt,1583168334.0,"Thank you for your thoughts. I agree with what you are saying my wife died in 4 months from anxiety/depression. Not enough time to figure out how to fix it. I'm not surprised the uk is a bit further along in thinking about things this way. I'm in Canada and changing the language is a bit of a battle though my perception of the US is that it even more of a struggle there with people saying things like ""committed suicide"" as if this was like some kind of samurai honour death. Though this does still happen here too."
widowers,fj7u9hs,t1_fj6svi4,1583098431.0,"Me too! I'm bagged by 9 and ready to sleep. Grief is exhausting.

Hey Doc are you really 100?"
widowers,fj7u0z9,t3_fbnb7j,1583098284.0,"You guys looked so happy together. I am sure you will love her forever. I will love my wife forever too. I hope I will find other love some time though I don't know what that means at this point. My wife and I talked hypothetically about the possibility of one of us dying and we both wished that we would find someone else to be with. That may not make is any easier to do. There is no schedule. Grief goes up and down in and out. I think is is possible you hold your grief along with your love for your wife forever. It just may at some point be possible to open your heart to love at some point.  I hope if you want this that it will be possible for you some day.

I still love my family and kids but it is different.

Do you have kids, friends or other family that you are close to?"
widowers,fj7rled,t3_f9kaca,1583096754.0,Wow you are right!! I guess I'm an ONLY parent too then. Before my wife died I'd say she did more of the kid caring and now I do all of it. On the other had my kids are the only ones who can relate to the searing grief that I am feeling losing my sweet wife. I really want to spend time with them now. Often at around 4:00 I hand around looking out the front window waiting for them to get home so I can hug them and make them dinner. I never did the before. I also seem to somehow love my kids more than I ever did. (I'm not sure how this is possible) Life is so strange.
widowers,fj7qoqb,t1_fj5ul8d,1583096181.0,Lovely post noradninja.
widowers,fj7qey0,t3_fbokmg,1583096008.0,Your kids need you and you need them. My wife died 2 months ago. I'm not in my 30s (I'm 51) but I am a single dad now too. How old are your kids?? Mine are 17 and 14. The 14 year old is having a real hard time at school as he does not have people to talk to. 14 year olds are not good at communicating at the best of times and this is not he best of times.  I know exercise is helping me feel a bit better. When I work out it lets out some of my angst. Getting the kids off to school is an accomplishment. Having dinner with them is the highlight of my day.
widowers,fj7pcyf,t1_fj4x4gm,1583095342.0,I'm glad you have family around you and they are being supportive. It makes such a difference. Many people do not or have the opposite and have conflict with their family.
widowers,fj6etny,t1_fj6ceqe,1583069605.0,"Thanks for your thoughtful reply and being respectful. I know the way I view the language here is unusual and uncommon but words are important.  You are right that the term ""committed suicide"" is offensive. This is something that I am working through myself. I don't want to get into the details of the actual way my wife died right now but the method she used was one that could not have imagined in a million years and it could have killed other people which would have left me with so much guilt.

I still think thing she died from depression which is the same language that people use when someone one died from cancer. When you think about it when someone dies from cancer that is usually not the actual cause of death. When you have cancer it causes other parts of your body to shut down. You stop breathing or you die from pneumonia, heart failure, kidney failure, poisoned to death from liver failure. Yet we still say that person ""died from cancer"" although it was not the ultimate cause of the instant of death.

I respect your choice to use the language that you use and I am not offended but I choose to say ""died from depression"". It was not the final event that killed her but it was the root cause.

I can feel your longing in your post and can relate to it. She was my soulmate, wife, business partner, best friend, mother to my kids and us utterly irreplaceable. I'll love her for ever but I'll never feel her love me back. All I have is the memory of her love."

widowers,fj5kp8m,t1_fj4h9p7,1583035142.0,"OH man thanks for writing. So fresh for you. It is like a searing pain.

I told my kids early on in this that in a couple of months everyone would stop to care about us. We are lucky that we have some people around us that really care  and I have my two boys.

Do you have kids or other family that you are close to?

Happy to chat offline if you want to."
widowers,fj5kbot,t1_fj4sxd0,1583034858.0,I'm glad you hold that time dear to you. I cherish the time I had with my wife but it was not enough time!!! We always talked about getting old together and now that will not happen.How are you doing?
widowers,fj5k73e,t1_fj4mbtk,1583034762.0,"I don't look at this as my wife taking her own life. Depression killed her. Mental illness killed her. She loved life. She wanted desperately to go back to being the person she was before she got sick.

This is why I don't describe her death as a suicide. This word literally means self-kill and that is not what happened to my wife. Her disease killed her. Depression killed her.

Depression can be as deadly as Brain Cancer.

I miss her so much.

I'm sure you miss your husband too."
widowers,fj5juuq,t1_fj5aa02,1583034513.0,How old where you when your mother died from mental illness? Did she suffer long?
widowers,fj5jqx6,t1_fj4t4p6,1583034434.0,Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Talking is the beginning of change but we are so far from solutions for this on this planet. It feels we are hundreds of years away from a solution to the darkness of depression.
widowers,fj4gzp7,t1_fj4cvyi,1583008051.0,In some ways not being alone is the sad thing. So many people are afflicted by mental illness it is an epidemic.
widowers,fj4gqnq,t1_fj4fucu,1583007881.0,"My wife's middle sister was manic. She had been hospitalized as a teenager. I remember how concerned my family was about her. She had anorexia too and weighed about 80 pounds.

I'm glad medication helps your sister-in-law it is great when you found something that works. Nothing seemed to make things better for my wife. Medication and therapy were not working and there was not enough time to try many different things. It happened in just about 4 months."
widowers,fj4g2jd,t1_fj4chn3,1583007435.0,Yeah the more people you talk to the more people you find out suffer  from mental illness. This is part of the stigma that our society has. People suffer alone with mental illness not feeling that people will accept them with this disease.
widowers,fj4fwy9,t1_fj49tnn,1583007332.0,True but sometimes life is ok. Just not now. I was lucky to have the love I shared with her. We had more love in our years together than many people do in their whole lives. I am also luck to have my family around me and I love them even more than I did before. This is not always the case.
SuicideWatch,fj3uuwb,t3_d2370x,1582993737.0,This is really unfortunate to have this policy. My wife died from depression 2 months ago and both of her sisters had died from mental illness 20 and 22 years ago. One of the things that was a big problem in their lives was changes needed in the way we treat mental illness and for attitudes in society to change. My wife felt so marginalized and stigmatized by society that when people asked her if she had siblings she would say that she was an only child which did not tell the whole story at all. When my wife felt safe she would tell her story and she always helped others who were struggling. Perhaps there is another subreddit that is interested in making some positive change in the way we deal with mental illness as this policy seems to prohibit this.
