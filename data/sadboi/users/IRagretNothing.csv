AmItheAsshole,feox086,t3_eq24av,1579307220.0,NTA. I think your sister should see a therapist though. She seems like she’s insecure and anxious all the time about what people think. There’s some people who aren’t trying to hide surgery but it seems like she doesn’t like the way she looks but is also scared about what people will think if she does anything about it. Being in your own head like that sounds exhausting.

He was about six years old in the video and could not function on his own. The mother was saying how during exams the doctors would say the baby was fine. Then it was born. The mother said that if she knew her baby would be like that she would have aborted. She said it’s for him and that she doesn’t want him to suffer but it’s also pretty clear that it’s because he is such a hard child to take care of and it messed up the parents lives. Then I read the comments, people were saying things like “wow, I feel so bad for this rich white family who have an inconvenience”"
