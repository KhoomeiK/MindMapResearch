BPD,fqlftw3,t3_gjfzwi,1589456899.0,"I dont know about anyone else but I actually find it a relief when for such a long time I thought I was the only one who felt or did something a certain way and im only finding out now that its to do with BPD. I dont think its as straight forward as ‚Äúwhy do i feel x? Its because of Y‚Äù because the feelings people experience arent always as straight forward as ‚Äúwhy am i scared ill be abandoned?‚Äù Etc. If anything I find the DAE posts very helpful in realizing that things I didnt know had to do with BPD, may have to do with it. Like i study forensic psychology and they show what BPD is but the symptoms are very straight forward in the notes and like all disorders or mental health issues, the symptoms arent always as straight forward as they are on paper and not everyone will experience every aspect of it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
In saying that, I think its clear that if an aspect of a personality disorder or mental health issue is caused you or others distress that working towards healing is still important. 
I just personally find it helpful to know im not alone in my thinking and also its nice to know why I feel a certain way so I can get to the source."
BPD,fq5fji5,t3_ggx5ke,1589103449.0,I‚Äôm really bad for being like ‚Äúi want friends.‚Äù And then after awhile kind of finding them irritating or not what i expected in a friend. üôà
BPDrecovery,fp5pem7,t3_gbgkk3,1588336695.0,"Ok firstly, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. 
That person that you think you lost as a friend, sounds like an absolute spanner. Fuck him. 

Him refusing to credit people for their work, is so ridiculous. The fact hes blaming you for getting him in trouble is even crazier.

Look how positive it is now for the original artist that people are now crediting them. You did good. 
Trust me when I say, you do not want a friend who cant take responsibility for their own actions. This is their fault, not yours. Try not to take on the blame when he clearly isnt. 

People will take advantage of you if you let them. The people who arent meant to be in your life, will leave as you grow, and the ones who are supportive and real friends, will be understanding and wont let you take blame for something thats not your fault  
Hope youre ok. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
