He's tired of living a lie. He's gonna lift up his sun dress and show off that new tattoo of Kaytlin Jenner on his ass cheek while shouting  #inspiration"

At my age now, I could imagine the relaxation of no screeching, oblivious kids on their phones blocking aisles, or temperamental little shits bothering people just to get a reaction"

Very glad they worked out for you"

Series is awesome.  Jon Faverau is doing an amazing job, loved Bill Burr's gunslinger, and I'll never look at Nick Nolte the same way again."

Gonna have to look up Luke's work and plan a piece if I ever get back to the islands. Righteous tattoo, brother."
childfree,fbzwhme,t1_fbzuv9i,1577265374.0,"> I knew I wanted to be CF when I was 15, so you are not too young to know what you want. And if you change your mind ( unlikely since you are CF) there is always fostering and adoption.

Exactly this. I got my vasectomy in my mid 30's, but I knew since I was a teenager that I never wanted children. Trust your gut."

I hope you know the individual on a personal level and they are worth the time you took, but being rational to the irrational most often doesn't end well."
StarWars,fb9605o,t3_ec3x2t,1576630241.0,That is fantastic. Would make a great tattoo for a theme sleeve as well
schizophrenia,f98kgk1,t3_e4avgf,1575179401.0,"Yes, often. Everyday conversations turn into games of charades, and I write down the names of new co-workers, along with their physical description, and spend a week or two cementing it into my mind.

The medication does make it worse, but it turns the volume down on everything else, and I'd much rather be a bit brain fogged than outright hostile."

The usual - my kids won't be her grandkids anyway (adopted; my bio mom is my father's sister), I'm pathetic, I'm useless, I'm going to burn in hell, I should have killed myself years ago, I'm the reason my bio mom is dead, etc.

I visited home and kept in contact for my father's sake. He passed a few years ago, and the incident in question happened in 2014."
