When we went to meet him he was the angriest most territorial dude, from what I read that comes from being cage bound for so long. He‚Äôs taken to me quite a lot now, we immediately taught him that saying ‚Äúpets‚Äù = I‚Äôm going to touch you and you don‚Äôt have a choice.

He already seems completely different out of his cage, I was able to pet his head and belly. This morning in his cage was Doritos, for breakfast. I‚Äôm fairly sure he‚Äôs malnourished and dehydrated, he smells like mold and mildew, almost that same foul smell you get when you squish an ant.

This is my first macaw and I‚Äôm starting to worry I‚Äôve made a big mistake. He‚Äôs huge, he‚Äôs neglected, he‚Äôs NEVER been held, he‚Äôs never had proper attention and love. His cage is so small, he has no toys and he‚Äôs a mess. 

 But... within 10 minutes we were bobbin heads, he moved to the front of his cage to see me better AND he took food from me (even listened when I told him slow). His screech is INSANE, it‚Äôs worse than any cackle I‚Äôve ever imagined,  but he listens when I go shhhh inside voices and whisper to him. He‚Äôs so curious and attentive, watching me and wanting me to interact with him. I hated leaving him there but we need to sleep and regroup to drive him tomorrow. 


Everything is all setup at home, we picked up a TON of toys from a local shop owner who closed her pet store and won the jackpot on perches, tstands and toy parts. But he‚Äôs a mess, he‚Äôs going to be so much work and he‚Äôs further off than I ever imagined.

You are much better off to let it run overdue for 3mo, then schedule a callback and cancel the account.* They will send you a bill that includes those 3mo overdue + the tab charge. If you don‚Äôt pay that within 3mo then they send it to collections usually. 


If you don‚Äôt call to cancel you‚Äôll get billed like 3-6mo before they really send it to collections plus the tab charge.

We chatted back and forth for awhile, lots of late nights and just needing stupid chatter. We‚Äôve been together for 11mo now and I‚Äôve never felt more in love and loved.

parrots,fpuzouj,t1_fpuz79e,1588929547.0,"What worked for our conure was to take him to his poop spot every 15 minutes or so, if he pooped (90% of the time he did) we celebrate with a GOOD POOP KIWI and a bunch of happy cheers, and taking him off immediately. If he poops somewhere else we try to take him back to the poop spot so he knows that pooping outside of the spot = less fun. 

I find myself throughout the day saying ‚Äúgood poop‚Äù A LOT just to reinforce that I‚Äôm happy with where he poops. 

Another good trick is to present a perch to them right when they wake up, catching the first poop of the day and celebrating is much easier than catching random ones if you aren‚Äôt watching. Then you can celebrate every Morning and make him happy to come hop on his perch to poop, can even give treats (whatever your bird likes). At the end of the day tho gotta watch the body language and for your birds quirks. Kiwi will get nippy at me, and I‚Äôm often like wtf dude?!? then I realize oh shit you‚Äôre holding it in and gotta go.

For the new policy essentially you are paying the monthly tab and Koodo is giving you a ‚Äúcredit‚Äù monthly on the backend instead of giving you it all at the beginning of the term. With this system you have 2 balances, 1) tab balance and 2) phone credit balance. If you upgrade early you‚Äôll oh what‚Äôs left of both.

Kombucha,foqvovw,t1_foq70r1,1588001656.0,"I use a crap ton of juice, like 3-4 fingers high of a 16oz bottle, let it 2F in the pantry for a few days, check the fizz then leave it in the fridge for a month or so more before I actually drink it"

I‚Äôd go with XS for kiwi if I was to get this one, S is a bit too big around the neck hole for him specifically"
parrots,fohl3lp,t1_fohj6kh,1587767758.0,"I personally hate it and so does kiwi. He‚Äôs a stubborn bird so having to get 3 clasps done up before he wiggles away is a pain. But he‚Äôs a stubborn skeptical bird who wants his way, so you might have better luck! 

I have a fabric one from amazon for my other bird (can check my post history) that just pulls over and sinches tight, and it‚Äôs a lot easier to get on."
parrots,focr9gf,t1_focpo5e,1587674798.0,"It was easy for this bird! He‚Äôs 9mo and we only started about 2wks ago. He just hated hated hated getting into it, now it‚Äôs a lot easier... once we are outside he stops making a fuss. 

My green cheek however... he‚Äôs 2ish and won‚Äôt go in. Absolutely screams bloody murder and flys into his hut to hide"

parrots,foaqwpe,t1_fo9lt5f,1587651068.0,Kiwi is the green cheek and mango is the jenday! Lots of people think he‚Äôs a sun conure and that‚Äôs totally okay
