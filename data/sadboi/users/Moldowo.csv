like i already see lots of players close to tier 80 (myself included) and i think they either wanna slow us down to make sure we play some more OR try to force us into buying tiers.

If they do not check their behaviour , I have no problem leaving the game. And I believe i am not the only one. Atleast some kind of extension to the double xp weekend or some free tiers should help. Or atleast act as compensation for the hell we went through this weekend."

It was 6th grade. I've had the worst day of my life back then. For background : my parents werent doing great back then , really tough times.

Of course , when 6th grade kids see people that are different than themselves , they make fun of that person.

They were making fun of me because I came to school in the same clothes for 3 days. And my (then) best friend, joined in on the action and started making fun of me. That friend was the biggest gold digger ever. He always played on my phone because his mom would take his away on the dumbest reasons. He would always beg me to buy him food , snacks , drinks because his mother wouldnt give him any money. Altough times were hard for me and my parents and we struggled with money , my parents still tried to give me everything I needed and everything they have had. In this case , pocket money.

That day I saw the truth. Something clicked in me. I called him out in front of the class , called him a gold digger , a gossiper (which is pretty bad in my country) and told him he was the biggest mistake of my whole damn life. After that day, nobody would even talk to him. I was the only friend he ever had.

To this day (freshman year of highschool) he still has no friends , he doesnt go out of the house and his mom is still taking his phone over stupid reasons. He still is a gold digger. He still is a mistake. 

But for me , since then , I've tried to change , to become better and to actually pick my friends , which I did. I feel very happy at high school. Middle school was a bitch."
