As you continue to talk to her everyday your feelings for her will get stronger so it's better to know what's on her mind.  If you decide to do the talk let us know how it went! Good luck :)"

attachment_theory,fjbeun4,t3_fcjlhk,1583191727.0,"Fearful avoidant myself, I would suggest for you to talk to him and explain how you feel and ask him to do the same. Also, you say he didn't acknowledge your existence and I can imagine that really sucks. By the way of it, he's really acting like an avoidant type. 
Ps: try to stay calm when talking to him and try not to blame or accuse him since that will make things only worse; just express your feelings. Good luck and let me know what happened  :)"
depression,fiu0x3w,t1_fittcs6,1582733248.0,"Yes, a friend of mine said it's like a door that once you open you can never really get it closed. I told this to my therapist but she said she doesn't think it's true and it doesn't work like that.."

depression,fiaxrsd,t3_f791jw,1582310511.0,"I was just thinking about the same thing and then I opened reddit only to see your post. 
I'm someone who is very sensitive and gets upset easily and for a very long time, I didn't believe I was depressed. Now I know that the constant heartache I was having was a big signal that it was indeed depression. For some time the pain is gone and I only feel it from time to time, this reassures me I'm in the clear.
But in those moments when it does come back, I get anxious and scared. I just try to remember it's temporary, it will go away, it should.."

Happy birthday!!"
depression,ffdejnc,t3_eqvvzh,1579819211.0,"That question 'Is it normal' keeps haunting me since I have been experiencing something similar like yourself. I started seeing a psychologist and she also suggested to talk to my doctor and maybe start taking antidepressants. However, I didn't do it and things got really better on their own. My psychologist was really surprised on our next session that I was feeling good again after being suicidal just two weeks ago. So is it normal, is it just life or is it depression, questions I keep asking myself.
One thing that helps me is I keep thinking about my future self. Especially now, since I have exams and I don't want to fail. I think about my future self and how I don't want to disappoint her, how I want to make her life easier and how just because now everything sucks and seems pretty pointless, it doesn't mean it will always be like this. And I don't want to mess up things for her, I want to give her the best I can. 
I understand how hard it is to get out of bed on some days, I can be very irritable too and have trouble sleeping, either too much or not enough. 
If you are really having a hard time, you can try taking the antidepressants. You can always stop taking them, you are always in control."

CasualConversation,erqefq6,t3_c3b8gj,1561141443.0,"I didn't have facebook for almost a year, including  Messenger. At first, it was nice and I thought Facebook was the reason for feeling down because I would compare my life with the one that my fb friends had. Unfortunately, things started getting worse. I remember during my first year of university I was missing out on a lot of events (school and non-school related) since everything was being posted on Facebook. Making friends was also an issue because  I couldn't contact  people that easily. I eventually downloaded messenger again and after that Facebook. I am glad I am back, to be honest. Mostly because I can see all the interesting events happening in my area and keeping in touch with my friends. 
While not using Facebook, I started using Quora much more and that did change my life in a positive way."

I tried wearing lenses one month ago and what really surprised me was how different my face looked like without the glasses, mostly the shape of it. Also, the world did look so different and may I even say more beautiful. Bonus point is that  I don't have to worry when cycling while it is raining. My eyes  get red and dry however after some time so I mostly wear my glasses. I hope all goes well for you and you get to enjoy your new 'sight' for a long time to come! :)"
AskReddit,ep5byqu,t3_btoccm,1559053504.0,"I used to think all of the people I saw on TV actually lived in the tv ""box"" and always wondered how they could all fit in there and where they go when we turn the TV off.
Then one day my mum smashed our tv with a hammer and I understood how television actually works. Must admit I was disappointed when I didn't  see any tiny people inside it."
