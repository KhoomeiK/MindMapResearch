From my extensive knowledge of yakuza orientated anime, apparently they’re all just thugs with a heart of gold. 

We’ll just ignore the murder and missing fingers and whatnot. That way I’m not terrified for this guy wandering into another yakuza bar. I mean... they fucking remove finger joints. Willingly. Thaaaats another level of scary in my books.

I want to give my dad a hug, and see my little sister. I want to spend valuable time with my grandparents. They’re getting older, and I’m missing out on spending the remaining time we have together. 
This would be the same if we had everyone behaving of course, but it would be over quicker. We may have had some sort of projection for time frames. Instead we don’t, and people are suffering purely because others can’t be bothered to give a shit. 

I’ve had people tell me it’s okay if the chronically ill end up dying, we take up a lot of resources as it is, and they think it’ll magically make them immune somehow if we all die horribly. It’s hurtful beyond measure to know people consider me collateral damage and it’s sickening to really KNOW that, because they actually tell you this openly. To have someone in front of me tell me these things, is shocking to me. They admit they don’t see my life as worthy or important. They’re not even pretending to care about other people, they act like the quicker
I kick the bucket, the quicker things will get back to normal.

It just baffles me that they sincrebtky want to hear and understand every word a stranger is saying, someone they wouldn’t look twice at usually, but they suddenly NEED to know what you said? That’s because those people assume you’re doing something terrible if you speak a different language. Which is insane to me, but here we are!"

It’s a weird I use for myself, as I’m not a lesbian and I’m not straight, I don’t feel like bisexual describes it well and neither does pansexual. It’s my own word that was used against me as a kid. That and the f word I’ll never use, and “dyke” which I don’t care too much about when directed at me by a certain amount of people. That said, they wouldn’t even use it as joke, either to me or to anyone else. I have respectful friends. My sister identifies as queer too, and she’s turning 17 this year. She’s half my age, and we feel the same way about it. However her and my dad often throw about other gay slurs as a joke to each other, and all I said was “I get that you guys find that okay, and that’s fine but I can’t hear that word, can you cool it til I go home?” And they didn’t kick up any sort of fuss. They apologised, and I didn’t need them to, they didn’t know I didnt find it as funny as they did. Again, they would never use any of those words to describe someone else. 

I may identify as queer, it’s the only word I’ve found that fits me, but I wouldn’t call anyone else it. Not unless they explicitly told me that was cool, like my sister. I wouldn’t assume someone else thought it was reclaimed or not. It doesn’t matter how I feel about it, in regards to everyone else, just myself. I can’t put those words on anyone not knowing how it could affect them."

Had a stepfather like this, he’s only JUST letting go of his hold on my mother, after over a decade of being divorced. They just know who to victimise and who they can control. I swear they have a sense for it, vulnerability. 

This guy is fucking headcase to do what he’s done with zero input from OP other than her saying no. That’s so alien to him that he doesn’t get it. Or he’s actively ignoring it. I’ll bet he’s always had everything he wanted, from childhood onwards. Ive known a lot of men like that, they don’t see women as people. Or human, or anything other than an object to collect. And yknow, objects don’t say no, so you can see why he’d be so confused clearly.. /s 
It’s scary. People wonder why I don’t trust anyone anymore, and it’s because I’ve known too many of these men that don’t hear the word “no” and take what they want anyway. It’s not unfounded. The difference is, I still see them as human beings. They don’t see me or any other woman that way."

Now, that does happen, but not 100% of the time, but I know people my own age who wield “self love” and what they are is actually very self centred. There’s a big big difference between those two things. It’s okay not to care about what people think of them, but it’s not okay to abuse people around them and then claim you just can’t “handle their worst”. It’s very unfortunate. I know a lot of people my mothers age who are like it too, it’s like they will purposely go out of their way to act like assholes and then just say “it’s just who I am I love ME, you clearly don’t”. OR “I don’t need to change for anyone” even when no one is asking them to do anything awful, just not be a twat to everyone around you.. 

Even my mother got that thing going on for a while, but she got past it because she realised she was acting like a complete asshole. Remember you also can’t question a boomer, they get super mad at you for even asking them something that may change their world view. Hell, they get mad if they do something bad to you and you tell them you didn’t like it. I think it’s also a grab of what they think young women want, they think we all want someone who’ll shoot someone in the head for us, they think we want to be seen as strong (which isn’t wrong but also nothing like this) and they think we like to be treated this way. It makes me wonder how many older women even talk to younger women, or do they have the same kinds of people around them enabling their bad behaviour? Fuck knows.

I remember one occasion, my best friend beat the shit into her girlfriend in the middle of the fucking town centre and no one did anything. I’m ashamed to say I ran, I was scared of her as well. If she could do that to her partner, she would absolutely have done it to me. And I feel shitty about that all the time. If it was a couple of years later, I would have gotten in the middle and covered this girl. But I was 15 and terrified at what I’d witnessed. It was completely fucked up. I remember asking her why the fuck she hit her girlfriend, and there wasn’t a need to beat her like that, but she looked at me like I was insane, and just told me because they were both girls, it “didn’t count”. We didn’t stay friends much longer after that. She was also coincidentally the person who told me I wasn’t raped because I was “supposed” to put out for my boyfriend, cos that’s what girlfriends do, what the fuck was my problem refusing him?

AskWomen,fqf2x8o,t3_giccgz,1589317824.0,"This isn’t a good way of coping, but this is how I am now, I just don’t get involved with anyone. At all. 

Because I know I’ll want them around me constantly, I’ll want them to be my number one and I, theirs. I’ll worry about not being text back. Or called. I’ll check the delivery times and get mad without telling them. I’ll most definitely push them away by wanting them in my goddamn pocket. 

So I decided I couldn’t do it anymore. I’m not lonely exactly, I dream regularly about ex boyfriends which is fucking annoying, I have a solid routine in that I know what I’m doing for each hour of the day. There’s too many things I put up as a barrier against being loved, I won’t relax them. I tried after my last major relationship and I ended up more hurt than I was over the break up. 

Here’s my reasons for not dating, or letting anyone close if anyone’s slightly interested in how a very hurt person copes with love or lack thereof; I’m an insomniac, I can’t sleep next to anyone without waking them. I get up if I can’t sleep, for example I went to sleep about 3.45am this morning and was awake again at 4.45am from nightmares. So I get up, turn on my playstation and play a couple of hours til I start nodding off again. 

I’m disabled, with a chronic pain condition. Last time I tried to have sex, I ended up being crippled the next day. I couldn’t walk because my joints were too painful. I was miserable. The effort it takes to finish is too much, so it’s pointless to try. Haven’t had one with a guy for about 9 years now. My disability also means I walk with a crutch and people seem to be a little embarrassed by that. Their problem, not mine but I’m not dealing with their shit about something I can’t help. 

I’m mentally unwell. Here’s the biggest issue. I have a personality disorder that makes me crave love and someone there for me. But it can also make me obsessive. I’m pretty good at handling it, because it’s been over half my life of handling it, I’ve *had* to. It doesn’t affect my friends or family, and I try really hard to make sure it never will. But in a relationship? It’s like someone’s opened the flood gates. So as much as I *can* control it, it wrecks me from the inside out. I try hard to not let them see me in a bad way, so it’s always internal. I refuse to allow that to happen again, last time I ended up feeling like I was losing my grip on things, so I stopped it. I also have major depressive disorder, anxiety (generalised) and PTSD. None of these alone make it easy to love me, but altogether? I don’t think I’ve ever found someone who was able to. I’ve been told I’m difficult to love, but I don’t know if that was just a hurtful thing to say to me for no reason. I don’t believe I’m a monster, I have a lot of empathy and compassion, I’m friendly and I try to make people laugh, and I’m the most chill person, I don’t judge people for shit. I try to be a good person at least. Try to make someone else’s day okay, to make sure *they’re* okay. 

I’ve had a lot of bad relationships. Whether I was too young to be in one, or too fragile, or they were compete assholes to me, it doesn’t matter. All of them ended up very bad. Even those I liked as a friend beforehand. People get nasty after a break up, no matter how nice you are to them. I fully intended to stay in touch with a few people, but they were so awful afterwards that I had to make a rule right there. 

All in all, people broke me, and I feel broken. I don’t think it’s even possible for me to be in a relationship anymore. I have such an aversion to it. And if I could make the ex boyfriend dreams stop that would be GREAT. 
I always answer these with huge paragraphs because I don’t really have a lot of people to talk to usually, so I kind of ramble all my thoughts out. Sorry!"

People have been letting off fireworks every week so at least I know it absolutely is fireworks, because last week me and my neighbour both thought it sounded like gunfire. I have heard gun fire, so I know what it came sound like, but luckily I’m pretty certain it wasn’t. 

I don’t think I’d handle it too well if I knew people did have guns. It would be fine if everyone subscribed to same safety and background checks, but they don’t want to. There’s some really responsible gun owners out there, I know a few people who have them over there purely because everyone around them does and they don’t feel safe being unarmed. Which I think I understand. But that’s scarier to me, to not really even want a gun, but to be afraid of the people living around you enough that you do get one. It seems like a hell of an awkward situation all round. People don’t want to checked, they want to be able to have weapons that aren’t necessary to safety or anything. Hell, I remember my great aunt having a shotgun above her bed in her room, and we all knew it wasn’t deactivated, but this was 25 years ago, and she was an old lady in the east end of London.

In the gun club I went to, I was sat next to a guy who had a rifle similar to one I was borrowing, so we had the same distance to shoot at. I was shooting at pennies, sideways and straight on, spinning and whatnot, and out of interest, I looked to see what his targets were. I looked down my sight, and he had pinned up his work colleagues group picture with him in it, and was taking off the heads off all the female colleagues. 

I remember telling my mother after we left and she just stared at me. I told her I was very glad he didn’t ask to handle a full firearm, and that he was at least sticking to air rifles.. but holy shit. That gave me shivers. Still does. THAT is why I can’t see us ever having the same gun laws, it’s tougher to shoot up your office building if we ban them I guess. 

I know not everyone is bad with guns, absolutely not, I’ve seen some really talented specialists, and honestly, I think I’d like to know what it’s like inside a tank when you shoot off that big ass gun, but the fear I’d have about going outside at all would be too huge I think.

So yes, I do believe that’s what they’re doing. There’s some dumbass people wandering around, but in order to organise anything they need people “in charge”, I can easily see them framing it like it was a protest and knowing full well it’s a powerful numbing device the more they do it. 

I’m just worried that a lot of people will end up shooting the public by accident. These aren’t the military, even if they believe they are. They think it’s simple to handle a gun, to point and shoot. Like, fuck even air rifles kick back on you, what are they expecting carrying a fucking rocket launcher at this point?

But that’s how they live their entire lives, they’ve been raised in this bullshit. I do believe that there are people who still believe that they’re going to have to do a Waco to protect themselves, when that’s not even close to their situation, there *was* significant wrongdoing by the FBI (planting a flag after the compound blew up, was horribly tasteless when there were dead kids burning up nearby) but that said, neither sides were 100% in the right. They can’t still continue to hold onto situations like Waco, as proof of the government coming after them. Don’t they think that it wouldnt have happened by now? Or will they keep raising more angry people with a chip on their shoulders? 

And then there’s the majority of them, who don’t believe that’s true. Having a lot of weaponry makes them feel untouchable and in charge. They fee that they can do what they want, and they thoroughly enjoy frightening other people. It’s a hotbed of short fused machismo, and perfect for people like that. It’s why they flock to it, they get to lord over people, scare them, make themselves feel big, and more importantly if they have any sort of charisma, it brings them power.  I cannot believe that so many people could be that obsessive over government conspiracy, but I can believe that there’s a hell of a lot of people who exploit those obsessions."

I’m concerned and have only gotten more and more concerned over the last couple of years. The marching, and the open carrying of some scary weaponry outside government buildings. I guess I won’t understand them at all be sure we don’t have guns here like you guys do. I can’t imagine thinking that is alright and not horrendously dangerous for everyone involved. Peop are jumpy, it’s asking for an accident to happen or for someone to take offence and to believe they’re upholding the law. There’s already been quite a few murders done by people who thought they could take the laws in their own hands. It depends on what “law” they think they need to follow. 
And there’s the militias. Who tell everyone who will listen about sovereign citizenship, about not allowing anyone to take their guns, or their liberty. They *should* stay antiestablishment no matter who’s in office, but a lot of decided to somehow flip their opinions to fit into liking the president. They can’t claim to be antiestablishment, they support him, and his *is* the establishment right now.

AskReddit,fq0h4vd,t1_fpz0174,1589031791.0,"Christ I’m sorry, this must be so difficult for you right now. I had a ex step parent who made my life hell for not being straight. I had the usual slurs thrown at me every day, and honestly, it made me believe I was a mad person for being who I am. I don’t feel like that anymore, but there’s still family members who wouldn’t want to listen to me whatsoever about who I am or who I fall in love with. 

At the end of the day we can’t change ourselves. We love who we love, and that’s completely concrete. I know how these people like to make us feel like we’re freaks or born wrong. But we weren’t. We were born just as perfect as everyone else. It’s demoralising, and dehumanising to be around homophobic people. I’m always very afraid of them based on how they’ve treated me. I’m not prepared to get a punch to the face just for not hiding who I am. One day maybe people will get over themselves, and quit bullying people they don’t understand. The way I explained it to my dad, (he’s not a homophobe but he’s old fashioned and wanted to know how or why I liked the same ex) was that I didn’t understand how or why he was straight, that the concept of not being able to fall for many different people, and that I couldnt understand it because I never was straight and didn’t make a conscious or unconscious choice to be this way. He got it. Both me and my sister identify as queer, and he’s fine with us. He may not understand but he tries to, and that’s more than what most people do. 

As a side note, my dad just went into remission for late stage throat cancer. It wrecked him, he lost all his teeth, his voice, his ability to eat or swallow. He had a feeding tube but still lost enough weight that he now weighs less than I do. I couldn’t put on a straight face, (excuse the pun) because I felt like if I saw him I would just cry like a baby. I commend you for being able to be strong enough for your siblings. My dad being sick really ruined me for months, he went through such a lot of chemo and radiotherapy.. it terrified me to see my dad shrink before my eyes and not be able to talk to me. You’re doing the best you can in a bad situation, you’re staying strong, and that’s so fucking brave of you. You’re a good person to keep up appearances despite everything, and you have a big heart to do that for your younger siblings. 
Keep safe, take care of yourself and keep fighting. Things will improve, they cannot get worse, so the only way to go is upwards."
AskReddit,fq0ffx2,t1_fpxvxxf,1589031059.0,"I agree wholeheartedly “. My life isn’t how I pictured it, never thought I’d survive past 17, but here I am at 31, disabled but not dead, and it’s been a really eye opening experience or reevaluate my “worst” times. To see why it happened or what my reactions were. It’s easier to look back over a number of years, than to assess at the time. I went to therapy for my PTSD and it really shocked m me at how I saw things and how I saw myself. It was a tough thing to come to terms with, disliking mysef, not feeling worthy to anyone, my body image issues. There so many things that I ended to untangle I have to go back again at some point, but it gave me the much needed permission to take care of myself too, that as a person I wasn’t bad or evil, and that I am worthy of being alive despite everything."
AskReddit,fq0c5fn,t3_gg63my,1589029908.0,"Yikes. Uhmm. It would be easier to point to the good phases, there’s a lot less of those and the rest is complete shit. I’m 31 and I’ve spent 23 of them fighting to keep my head above water, sometimes failing and sometimes just grabbing onto a handhold in time to save myself from drowning. 

I think I’m relatively better compared to my childhood or teen years, even my twenties. But being a good person and trying to help others at the detriment of myself made me doormat and in turn made me push away anyone who may or not take advantage of me and my need to help or be kind to others. It’s happened of course, a lot of people have done that. But now I can see that it doesn’t matter, I can tell someone to get away from me if they’re hurting me, I can tell someone I actually deserve bodily autonomy and they can’t cross that boundary. I can stand up for myself now, with limited success admittedly but it’s still a new thing to me, demanding to be treated like a human being. 

But if I could pin point where the cascade started, I would say at 8/9. My dad had left when I was a baby, and so me and my mother lived alone in a little house together. I had a*great* childhood up til then, because my mother met a man when I was 2 years old who wanted to be with her *and* take care of me as his own. And that man was and still is my hero. He didn’t once undermine my bio dad, who started seeing me more after non-bio dad told him he should before I grow up too quickly. He had a huge extended family, and I grew up with beautiful cousins, wonderful aunts and uncles, and so much laughter and singing. I don’t think I could have asked for more, i was loved by three entirely different families, taken care of like I was blood family by his huge, wonderful, crazy family. 

Except my mother met someone else when I was just turning nine years old. I didn’t understand, I just loved my dad, and I begged her to let him stay. Clearly kid logic, but I was so distraught. I passed out dead cold in school the next day. The other man turned out to be a monster. He actively hated me, and since I didn’t want to call him dad as well, after what, a couple of months? He held that against me forever. My dad had to leave, and I visited once with him after that. I was told a LOT later that step father had answered the door to my dad who came to see me. My grandfather overheard him telling my dad that he wasn’t welcome, he was hurting me by visiting and needed to stay away from me. He told *me* that my dad needed to leave and live his own life now, and I was hurting him by wanting to talk to him or see him. That I shouldn’t be selfish and let him go. 
And because I was 9, I believed him. I never saw my dad again, even though occasionally I look him up, it still hurts like someone’s jabbed a kebab skewer into my chest. 

I think there will always be a tiny part of me that’s convinced my step father was right, that I was hurting him by staying in contact. He got married, he had children and he works with many many different colleges to help disabled students. He did the same thing all that time ago too. He never changed, he was always a good and kind hearted person, and he still is. Last time I looked him up, he was playing in a southern gothic blues band and it’s so bizarre to me because that’s the music I enjoy the most I think. We had a lot in common, and he taught me lot of things. Like he sparked my interest in marine life, and taught me to surf sporadically (I wasn’t very good), he showed me so many genres of music I can thank him for me having such an eclectic taste I music, and showing me that there’s merit in different kinds of music, that I shouldnt write off a genre because I prefer another one. He was right, I completely agree. 
He did start to teach me how to ride a bike and then had to leave. I never did finish learning that. It never felt right to me, having someone else teach me to do it. But most importantly, he taught me good morals, the ones where you help others and do good things, not for praise but because people need each other. To never judge anyone unless they give you a reason to. That if anyone tried to touch me and I didn’t want to be touched, I could refuse. (I preferred my chosen few people to hug, and didn’t want to hug anyone else) 


Damn. That was long and more than a bit heartbreaking.
I’m sorry I dont have a redemption story, or a great ending to make all that pain worth it, because it got worse from there. Up until I moved out at 19 and escaped that hell hole, I went through so much that my brain just.. broke. I now have a personality disorder courtesy of the abuse, and PTSD from a trauma that surpassed them all put together. But I will say, that although I developed a lot of mental health problems, and then being diagnosed with a chronic illness a couple of years ago, I live by myself, I’m poor but carrying on regardless, I have two wonderful animals who help me a lot mentally, and I’m alive. I didn’t think I’d see my 17th birthday, this time I have now is “extra time”. I wasn’t ever meant to be this age or here at all, so I go through my extra time doing what I can to make my small world better, doing things that make me happy or at least a close approximation to happiness. I learned that if you take away all the people who are out of harm you, you’re actually not that bad off. I can lock my front door and be safe in there. 

If anyone else is having a rough time, please know that although it’s entirely your choice to take your own life, stop and consider the people that care about you. And I mean, genuinely care, not just pretending to give a shit. Because yes, being alive after 17 was not my plan, and it didn’t get better, but if I’d taken my life, I wouldn’t be here now, to carry on trying to do good in my tiny world. I always thought my family would just get over it and move on, but I was dead wrong about that. Just remember to hold fast, and keep your head above the water."

We’d painted and distressed it (‘‘twas the 90s, it was all the rage) so it looked like this really whimsical captains chest on an old ship! Super cool, and I loved the thing, I used to hold the rope handles while watching tv when I was little. Anyway, when we had moved house, we took it with us and it had pride of place in our living room as a coffee table. 

I was maybe.. 14/15 at the time, and I was looking into the mirror above the fireplace to tie up my hair. Just standing next to the chest, as per usual. Aaaaand then I heard scratching. Inside the chest. Loud as fuck scratching. I recall just staring at it, like “uh excuse me I’m clearly hearing shit” and it just. Kept. Going. 

So I ran away. Hahaha I ran up to my room and didn’t tell a soul. I checked it later on, no mice, no rats, no nothing. Not a scratch to be seen, and it was still full up to the brim with books and things. Never did work that one out. 

I will clarify slightly that I *do* have auditory hallucinations now, but not then. I didn’t develop that until I was around 19. So either this was a weird fluke of a hallucination that appeared standalone for years, or uhhh... the ghost of a tiny sailor was trapped inside?"

AskReddit,fpwq9yg,t3_gfsi0q,1588967999.0,"Hmm.. okay I’ve never told a single person about this, so here we go. 
When I was about 12, my parents moved me and my baby sister to a new house and started renovations. The idea was that I would have the attic room and there would be an office next door to my bedroom. 

So we went ahead and after about a year of all of us sleeping in the living room, and no roof, I had my new bedroom. Now that would ha e been amazing IF I had stayed up there but I was spooked for some reason and couldn’t sleep up there at all. So my poor little sister had to share with her grumpy preteen older sister until I got my shit together. She had a bumk bed that had been mine, worth a desk underneath instead of a desk. She did not want to give this up, and I totally understood so we kind of half jammed my bed underneath this and I slept there. 
Everything was a-okay, until one night, I was awake and looking above me because this was a long ass time ago and I didn’t have a phone to play on, and my game boy had been commandeered by my sister and not around me at that moment. So while I was staring at the ceiling/half of the underside of my sister’s bed, I noticed a very soft light coming from behind the blinds. My mother had made them, so they were light material, not blackout.  I thought it was a security light, there were many instances of foxes and cats setting them off in the area.
Except it moved. 
It was blue, but not really bright, as if someone had turned a dimmer switch on something. So I got out of bed and wiggled my way past the bunk bed ladder, to see this light and where the hell it was coming from. Security lights don’t move, so it was obvious to me that it wasn’t that. 
What I saw, and I dare you not to laugh at me, was a tiny blimp shaped object. It had very very small blue lights around bisecting it, and was moving veeeery slowly past my window. I could have opened the window and touched it, that’s how close I saw this thing. 
In the room, we were one floor up, and there was a tall pebble dash wall separating our house from the neighbour. The wall blocked the view into their garden from the window, so it started at ground and stopped just above my window. The thing, just went through the wall. 
I hadn’t even considered the wall at the time until I saw that and finally it hit me that this was not normal, and I ended to stop looking at it. So I tumbled back into bed, and covered my head with a duvet like a big baby. 

Never told a single soul. I thought I was off my head. And I did have a really crap step parent who would never have let me forget what I’d said about it. So I guess this is the next best place to tell someone? 
Think what you will of this, I don’t know what the hell
I saw or if I even saw anything at all. But here it is, maybe I saw a miniature ufo, maybe I was utterly barmy."

AskReddit,fp76wm9,t1_fp6bpe2,1588365150.0,"I think so too actually. It’s amazing to me that people do treat animals like a piece of furniture to lug around but animals *do* care about certain people more than others, they have preferences, they’re still alive, breathing creatures. I can’t imagine giving up my cats at all but I couldn’t just give them up based on their personalities and quirks. They wouldn’t cope well elsewhere, one of them refuses to be around any other person but me. So that just wouldnt work. 

It’s even more so with dogs I think, I’ve never had my own dog but watching my family members both treating their dogs well, and treating them like something to replace with something more “fun” it kind of breaks my heart a little. They have their favourite people and their favourite places, and they just want to love you when it comes down to it. Animals have the capacity to care, and that right there is why I think it should be considered properly. If one person doesn’t take into account dietary issues, that animal can quickly become really sick. I have a cat with a lot of allergies and I know which things he can have or not have. The list is huge, but it’s in *my* head, not anyone else’s. Maybe I’m biased because I love my animals a lot, I don’t feel like I own them, they’re choosing to be around me. If they didn’t like me at all, they’d be avoiding me, both are very picky like that. They’re more like companions than pets. “Pet” sounds weird to me, I don’t know why."

My ex was a little boy at the time and he loved his dog, like they were truly always together. I think it was more the fact that my ex looks so much like his father, that she wanted to punish them both.

It meant a victory for me and my mother so it wasn’t petty to us, but it didn’t do anything more than embarrass our abuser so I class it as petty. 

Basically my ex step father is a terrible person. He quite literally broke my mind as a child and kept my mother under his control for the majority of the time I knew him. This didn’t stop him conducting affairs, and I guess my mother found out. So he left, got a new place etc, quite far from us. I could finally BREATHE without him calling me various homophobic slurs or picking on my appearance or blaming me for something. It was wonderful actually, despite us being left with no money. He cancelled all direct debits, so my mother was struggling to feed us and my little sister. 

But then on a really bleak day, she came to me and said “I need to tell you a secret” and I was like “uh ok” being 15, I totally wanted to know an adults secret so I was all ears. She went on to tell me how she had picked every third stitch of every third suit he owned. (He was a businessman type who took way too much notice of his own appearance. So his suits were his identity almost) and that when she found he had cheated on her for a prolonged amount of time she once out some chilli powder in a pair of underwear in a “fit of madness” as she put it. 
She was actually telling me because she felt terrible for it. But when she looked up at me, she saw I was trying my hardest not to burst out laughing. She started to smile a little. And we both laughed til we cried because it was her only instance of standing up for us, in that tiny way, she tried to do something. It didn’t add up to what he did to either of us, especially when he came back and she spent more years with much worse physical abuse when I left finally. 

But my god, the thought of him putting that suit on and it crumbling, truly made my day. Even the potential of making him slightly inconvenienced and annoyed, meant we got a point scored for our team. I won a match, not the whole league, but we scored that day at least."

But then, family influence and money is a huge factor in getting to be where he is now, anyone else who didn’t have that, who had the same qualifications, wouldn’t have achieved what he has. I think he’s let off a lot because of his status, among his peers at least."

He was married, so having children is often expected there. But he can’t excuse having an affair and rejecting that child, or ignoring other children because he doesn’t really have the emotional space for them I suppose. My uncle has the same amount of children, with more partners. The difference there is that although he has his first too young and his second without really being ready. He wasn’t a good father, it wasn’t anything to do with the amount of partners he’s had. It’s always been about him being there. And he wasn’t. However, he also realised that, and with his last two babies, born last year and this one, he makes more effort. He looks after them as well as their mother does. He’s changed his attitude to all of his children, he does everything he can for them now. I’m not saying he’s perfect, I’ve only just started getting along with him after knowing him 30 years. But at least he doesn’t deny any children, doesn’t neglect them. Most of them are now adults anyway, but he is there for them now. 


I’ll wait and see about Johnson. I expect that he will do the same thing eventually, he seems to get bored and goes elsewhere at some point. He’s flighty, and doesn’t stick to one thing forever. But then, he’s always been allowed to do that. No one has told him no. He’s still the same guy that burned £50 notes in front of homeless people, just getting kicks where he can I guess. If he showed us he had changed, that he could say he fucked up and he was sorry, it would make a huge difference to me personally. Instead I just see him as an overgrown child playing politician because he was born into affluence and debauchery. He’s not a great role model for anyone really. It does concern me that he was the only next option after May walked away. That doesn’t give me a lot of faith in the Houses of Parliament.

britishproblems,fp091k6,t3_gacorb,1588204762.0,"I’m quite disturbed by the drastic change in opinion on him just because everyone else stepped down, and he was next. They’ve all spent years mocking him, making him into a clown and therefore “not a bad man”. 

People know what he did in university, and shrug. They’ve shared so many pictures and videos of him looking dishevelled and unkempt, stuck on a damn zip wire with some union flags, tackling small children on a rugby field, and on his bicycle from when he was mayor. They’ve all done that, joined in, and yet now he’s lord and saviour of Britain? I don’t understand how easy it’s been to change him entirely into something people are clinging to. It’s confusing and I can’t work out how it happened. No one has any sort of faith in him as a politician, they thought he was just a funny scruffy looking man around for amusement. Court jester-like almost. But he’s now in power and I haven’t seen anything different in him directly. Just how people talk about him. I’m concerned mostly that people seem to be treating his child as the next messiah, and it’s getting a hit uncomfortable when people gush about it and I’m like “.. ok?” It’s nice he’s had a kid an all, but his partner gave birth to that kid, not him."

AskReddit,fncye5x,t1_fnc9jyk,1586851605.0,"Exactly this, it’s not difficult to be kind. To consider someone worthwhile as a human being. I’m disabled as I mentioned previously and I have had all the most ignorant comments in the last couple of years since my diagnosis. It makes you feel like you’re essentially collateral damage if you die or become impoverished. I’ve had people tell me I need “get over it” as off my disability can be switched off. I walk with a crutch constantly and the amount of people who ask “what’s wrong with you” is unreal. What’s wrong with me? No what’s wrong with *them*, asking that question like they do? 

And then there’s anti vaxxers who basically say that a child with autism is worse than having a dead child. That really REALLY boils my blood. I don’t want to hear that shit about my own family or anyone else. 

Everyone needs a hand sometimes, that’s been a tough realisation for me becoming disabled over a couple of years, that I need to ask for help. And that’s okay. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t care about that now. If I need assistance, I needed assistance. So their thinking is so alien to me, I can’t explain it. Not one person is an island, no matter how able bodied they are, or how their mind works. It’s not hard to be kind, like I said. The world would benefit from different points of view and some care for each other."
AskReddit,fna3a2b,t1_fn88mtq,1586790192.0,"I really think my little cousin will be that kind of person if he’s supported in the right way. I’m worried that his dad and stepMother treat him like a toddler but I know his mother is in his corner. She had to endure YEARS of family accusing her of causing his autism. She worked full time at home and had her own magazine ffs, a nationally bought famous pregnancy magazine. She accepts that she worked too much and didn’t see the kids enough, she regrets it in that way. But that isn’t what caused his autism. It just happened. She’s the one who fought for him having one on one tutoring to help him, got him into a private school. He was putting things in the Fibonacci sequence as a toddler, so I don’t doubt he will succeed if properly supported. I don’t doubt him at all, he’s a sweet kid, with a smile that could break hearts. A genuine grin that he gives people he trusts enough. 

Like how could you pity him? He’s different than other people sure, but so are a lot of others. It makes me angry to know my grandmother pities him. I’m pretty proud of him already honestly and I’ve never had the pleasure of meeting him in person. He’s an ocean away, but I’m still very proud of him getting past all those obstacles they said would be in the way. They were, but he climbed over them and that’s awesome to me. 

And one of my best friends in university had quite severe autism, he struggled a lot being in a class and being in a crowd of loud people there. He couldn’t really handle delays and changes in plans, and before I know he had autism, I dropped into our exhibition without telling him. I was shocked to find he disappeared. Then our mutual friend explained to me, and it clicked. It wasn’t hard to accommodate him, just give a heads up. Eye contact was difficult so I didn’t do it. It’s not difficult to treat someone right so they’re comfortable. He was the only one in our class who got a First. His essays were incredibly intricate. He lived with his partner, who shared the mortgage and they had a great life together. 

This is why I can’t stand the judgment dealt on top of people. I don’t understand how you can pity someone without knowing them whatsoever. 
My cousin and friend and your cousin have literally kicked down barriers people just put on them without ever asking if they wanted to try. They basically said no, I’ll climb over thank you. That’s amazing, despite all the negativity and disapproval."

I keep trying to reiterate the risks to family, but my grandmother saw the little kids twice after we were under lockdown and then lied to me about that shit. I won’t be seeing her in person for a long long while, she’s so goddamn sick anyway without the goddamn virus. I’m not seeing the newest babies because I’m too scared I’ll carry something there by accident, and I’m scared for my own health issues, I have to be inside. I’m not seeing family because I actually care about them. Kids should be at home, or sheltered-in-place if that’s not possible. we all should be unless we are absolutely required to go out to work or support others. It’ll be over sooner if we do.

Like 200% likes that he will punch a wall, smash his own glasses in his fists, smash soda cans into any hard surface, or throw things. Never at me. And he prided himself on his anger problem, he got it from his dad he said. He also was proud that he’d never laid a hand on a woman, just like his dad. He didn’t realise that you can terrify someone to the point of insanity doing this shit. You don’t *have* to hit someone to scare them and control them. 
It was always a feeling of “At least I’ve never hit you”, like that deserves a medal. 


What I learnt was I couldn’t win, I was very mentally unwell and made some stupid decisions because I was having serious issues with my mind. He fucked me up no doubt in my mind. I’m not blameless entirely and I’m not saying every argument was like that, but it was the majority of them. Unfortunately that lead to a lot of bad relationships, didn’t know what I was doing or thinking half the time. I hope your relationships improved after your ex wife. Because Christ it’s fucking DISHES. Why would anyone be such an asshole about something like that? How dare you make her grate her own cheese! /s it’s better value in a fucking block where I am, and the ready grated stuff feels powdery to me? Blech, no thanks.

BPD,fmxwckq,t3_fxm4t2,1586473171.0,"I don’t know if I count, because I do my best to control myself at any cost, so is that recovery? I have no idea. But I’m 31, and I developed this disorder in my early teens. 

For me, I guess I don’t think I’ll be “recovered” in that I believe I’ll have to keep a hold on myself as much as I can. I’m medicated for MDD and severe Anxiety, so that helps somewhat. 
I used to be very scared to tell anyone the name of what I have, but now I’m working on being more open with family and friends. I’m an adult person, I don’t have to hide things from them anymore. I’m lucky that I have my mother who respects my privacy, my space and the need to look after myself. I always think I’m a bit shit at doing that part, and I’m probably right. I should look after myself more, I need a lot of therapy still, and that would alleviate some symptoms I think. 

The behaviours I displayed as a teenager were not great towards myself, I was always more of an internally angry person. Lots of blame, and self destructive shit that I was already getting from an abusive parent. In my twenties, it turned to the kind of thing where I stopped hurting myself. But I sure did drink and I guess after I was left by my first major ex, it all went a bit insane. 
25, I tried more drugs I hadn’t ever tried and probably wouldnt again, but I wanted to escape my head. I was jumping into bed with people not thinking of their OR my feelings on the matter. 
And then it really hit the fan, and my dissociative episodes ramped up to a point where I was losing time at work, I lost a few jobs in a row. 
But by my 27th, I was out of another major relationship, abused and lied to horribly. And things didn’t go well for a while then either. 



The things that happened I mostly had a control over my wildest behaviour so it only negatively affected me. However that doesn’t mean I think I didn’t hurt anyone. I’m sure I did. It was only until my 25th that I truly tried my hardest to never hurt anyone again. 

So in recap, I went from self injury and eating disorders as a teen, and into my twenties as a sexually charged person who needed the validation. I can admit that now. Hell, I worked as a cam girl at that point, I couldn’t stop the good feeling I got for having people who liked me. 
And now I’m early thirties. Not sexually adventurous or wild, not dissociating as badly as I used to. Putting people first no matter the cost. I dont want people to be attracted to me anymore, and I’m honestly better off on my own. Maybe that’s sad. But there’s no bigger red flag to the bull that is my borderline, than a relationship. I refuse to do it. It won’t help either person, and I’ve tried quite a few times now. I’m okay with being alone now. 
So I guess recovery is not physically hurting myself, not sleeping with people i had no feelings for, and no drinking. No ridiculous spending.  No self sabotage. And if it costs me some time around others, that’s okay. It’s worth it for me. 


Recovery is a weird word for me. I was always told there wasn’t a recovery available for me. So I just kind of shrugged and agreed, and then found a different way of not having it affect anyone I love. Recovery is different for everyone. The borderline is absolutely there, but I’m able to get inside and away from people if I need to cry or have a meltdown. No one else has to see that."
