She doesn't look thin or sick in the photo.  My dobie girl is only 60 pounds.  The female I had before her was 95.  I bet that she's going to just be a little petite girl.  What does your vet say?  I can't remember how old my 2 yr old was at 8 months but I do remember at 10 months she was at 60 and has stayed there since.  

She is so beautiful btw.  I believe smaller dogs have less health problems as they age."

raisedbynarcissists,fkumb3s,t3_fkqsin,1584552049.0,"Things that sometimes help me:   Work towards your inner dialogue becoming your champion.  Just because we didn't receive encouragement and caring words as a child does not mean that we don't still need to hear it.  It's a hole that some of us have.  Going along those same lines, be kind to yourself.  Self-care is something many of us also didn't learn because we received so little care.  Try to be that parental voice that you missed.  Remember we all say or do things around people that we regret, some of us can be so much more sensitive to our own behaviors and tend to punish ourselves.  Try switching roles, think of how you would like to react to somebody behaving in a way that you did, would you beat them up about it the way you beat up yourself?  

I think it's so important to stand in as our own advocate.  Think of it as protecting your inner child.  They're still in there and carrying a lot of the same hurts.  If you were an adult and saw a hurting child, how would you react to them?  React the same way to yourself."

Whenever she comes up to an intersection she knows to 'wait' until momma says 'cross'.  If there's no traffic I will say cross before she gets there and she has figured out momma's gonna say cross if there are no cars.  She knows if she sees a car she's gonna wait.    She also knows to retract her leash and walk next to momma whenever we come across a human or animal.
