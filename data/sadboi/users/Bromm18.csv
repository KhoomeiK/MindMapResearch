Original person who was actually harassing the younger sister was meanwhile off pilfering desks and backpacks in our classroom. One of the stolen items was an external hard drive that belonged to another student and they used it to store their homework, projects and other stuff on it). Asshole put that external hard drive in my desk so afterwards after getting the crap kicked out of me I was being accused of theft as well. Police were involved and since i was 18 at the time I stupidly declined to have anyone else present and they kept demanding to know where the rest of the items were. Short time later they found out the hard drive had been removed from the external case so all that was in my desk was actually an empty external hard drive case. Short time later some other student admitted they saw the asshole stealing the stuff and he was caught, made to return the items and eventually kicked out of the charter school. I never did learn why I was chosen as the target, maybe because I had no friends and was a bit antisocial, not sure. Student and his friends that assaulted me were suspended for a time and he was actually a decent person afterwards when he learned I hadn't done what he was told I had done.
