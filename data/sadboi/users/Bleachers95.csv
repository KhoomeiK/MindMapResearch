Also, for what it’s worth, parents forcing their kid to participate won’t help anyone.

Up until then there was no action that episode bc every other character was just talking about there will finally be peace.

Let’s not forget about the people getting sick and/or dying from the virus. 

Unless you were actually in the room with the president when he made these decisions, then unfortunately I’m not going to pay too much attention to what you’re saying. I could understand the sentiment of what you’re saying, but that doesn’t mean I agree with the argument you’re trying to perpetuate. Can’t we just leave the conspiracy theories at the door for a while and focus on helping people who are genuinely affected by this virus? 

Besides, if you have time to blame the president for what’s happening, then that means either you’re in denial of the damage the virus can cause, or you’re well enough off to have such a cavalier attitude about it. Either way isn’t respectful."
