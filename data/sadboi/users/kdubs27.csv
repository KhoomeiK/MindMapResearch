halloween,f3vhwwd,t3_cnocu1,1571176477.0,"Hey, fellow Halloween fans!

My husband and I host a podcast, and we're so excited to be able to talk about a store that's iconic for so many Halloween enthusiasts - Spirit Halloween. I always love seeing these stores pop up in August, so it was really nice to be able to visit the stores and dig into deep research on them in the name of our show.

We published the first of two episodes about Spirit Halloween today. We'd love to get some feedback from folks who also know and love the holiday - or even the store itself! Please give a listen if you're interested! Thanks in advance :)

Tulpas,f0n0bvj,t1_f0mynqc,1568757304.0,Hey! I think we're on Spotify! Let me know if this link works: [https://open.spotify.com/show/4LLHcVzYXm31c6J5CETT4z](https://open.spotify.com/show/4LLHcVzYXm31c6J5CETT4z)
Tulpas,eywx9d9,t3_co6x8e,1567539983.0,"Hi all! Just wanted to give you the heads up that I'm still going through and responding to everyone - the outpouring of responses has been AMAZING and it's literally taking me weeks to catch up to everyone! Really can't thank the community enough for sharing so much with me.

We just published our first episode about tulpas - more of an overview of the concept as a whole. Our next episode (in two weeks) will address your experiences directly, and will mostly be reporting on your responses and experiences that you shared with me. I'll be sure to update you when we post it!

In the meantime, if you want to check out the first episode, you can find it [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/13-the-imaginary-friends/id1458429034?i=1000448434011). I'd love to get any feedback/corrections! We tried to be balanced, open-minded, and well-informed, but please let me know if you think we got anything wrong. Our podcast is largely pro-tulpa, so hope you enjoy!

It's been really amazing how many different kinds of people that have been willing to talk to us (I got to chat with some other awesome redditors when we did an episode about Cicada 3301, had some both pro & anti Mary Kay people talk to us, and even a PhD student chatted with us for a future episode). I'm just kind of...anxious that the other shoe will drop :-/ But no problems yet!"

We try to end each episode with a definitive conclusion, but what we're learning on the way (which should've been obvious to us) is that there's WAY more gray area than we would've expected. The binary kind of gives us the space to explore that gray area."

I'm considering posting on r/tulpas, but I want to avoid coming off as judgmental or biased or exploiting the group or anything like that. I was interested to find this group, and given that our podcast has a skeptic bent, figured we'd more easily vibe with another skeptic group :)"

vegan,ewcm7ag,t1_ew69i0w,1565287031.0,Thanks so much for listening!! I'm still really surprised there aren't any open in LA. Feels very strange to me. Maybe they can't compete with Cafe Gratitude and others?

And I'm definitely NOT saying the pope doesn't for sure lead a cult... we'll have to tackle that topic someday on the podcast ;)"
vegan,ew82cax,t1_ew5ywnu,1565201939.0,"I was honestly super surprised that there wasn't any direct proselytizing while we were there. Yes, the TV was one, but you're right, I didn't really get a ""preaching"" vibe."

I'm honestly really surprised we don't have one in LA!"
vegan,ew8226k,t1_ew6gpqv,1565201773.0,Oof - didn't see this before replying :-/ . I had NO idea there was any of that going on. Do you have any sources re: the members working for free? (I'll also Google it myself - that's pretty upsetting to learn). Thanks for the heads up!
vegan,ew81y4g,t1_ew69rt9,1565201709.0,"Yeah, the property snafu, fake name, and donation return definitely make me suspicious :-/ . I really hope the people that work at the restaurants make a fair wage. I wonder if there's a way to look into that :-/"
vegan,ew81uvi,t1_ew6g8fb,1565201656.0,"This honestly makes me feel better, thank you :)  I agree there's definite culti-ness, but feels like maybe that's not necessarily an ethical issue here.

Also - I'd LOVE to do some of the major world religions as a topic someday, bc I kind of think that most religions have cult-like aspects, or started as cults (and, frankly, deserve more criticism for it; not that religions are bad! i just think we ignore some of the cultier aspects like the brainwashing and evil you mention)."
