starcraft,fqr7jf3,t1_fqplps5,1589579058.0,"You know the classics: Vibe's Bronze to GM, watching tutorial videos of WinterSC and  [https://lotv.spawningtool.com/](https://lotv.spawningtool.com/) for builds.

When you get cheesed, research for some time: if it was a cannon rush, what can you do appart from scouting? Know how many workers you have to pull, if you should focus on the cannon or pylons, etc. The same for zergling rush: learn to wall of your main/expa vs zerg with buildings and possibly units, and your muscle memory will start telling you what you need: vs. zerg as toss, for example, Zealots are great for killing zerglings, but in PvT and PvP they are mostly useless until they have charge.

For macro training: know how to expand correctly and try to practice good economy on 2 bases without letting your minerals or gas go above 400-500. Try to keep a good balance between army and resources. Keep making probes, keep  your gateways/barracks/etc. on cooldown (if they are not, you are not using them well enough; if they are and you still have extra resources, you need more production). You will have to burn some mechanics into your brain: cycle between bases, make workers and check they are not over/undersaturated, upgrade tech if you need, then build units. If money is still overflowing, make more production facilities. Go check your bases again and start over. All while keeping an eye on the minimap and probably scouting from time to time.

&#x200B;

Finally, map awareness and scouting is key (I suck at this). Spotting a push 30s earlier can be the difference between being able to make counter units or lose the game. 

&#x200B;

Ah! And before you get into all of that, study all the units in the game and the counters for your race. A dumb example (PvZ):

\- I start making zealots. He switches to roaches.

\- I would probably switch to robo (if I don't have one) and start pumping out immortals.

\- He sees my immortals, starts the switch to hydras.

\- I place robo bay and research and make colossus (or I might go HTs).

\- He sees the colossi and then builds a spire, starts making out corruptors.

\- I add Templar Archives or Dark Shrine to get archons, research blink and try to get as many stalkers as I can. Stop Colossi production, maybe switch to disruptors.

In SC2 counter units and harassing (this is harder to pull) means A LOT. A couple of immortals with 6-7 stalkers might deal with 15-20 roaches, whereas 25 zealots will probably not. 10 HTs with storm might be powerful, but could also easily die to mech."
starcraft,fqpjt24,t1_fqpf99c,1589548083.0,"It will all stabilize. 

My recommendations are (and take this with a pinch of salt, since I'm still platinum 3):

- learn a good all-around build and practice it. Maybe try opening safe and/or fast expand, and work on your macro on 2-3 bases (don't try to focus on more  for now, it might overwhelm you). Try to be macro-efficient on 2 bases.

- learn defense against common rushes and cheeses. These will be present from bronze all the way to GM. Proxy rax, proxy Stargate, cannon rush, zerg rush... Have good scouting at the start and learn to deal with those and you will get fast MMR by winning vs cheeses instead of losing your hard-earned MMR to cheeses."

allthingsprotoss,fm3xkzw,t1_fm3g8v3,1585740597.0,"Well, against early rushes, early scouting. I usually scout at 14 with the probe I build my first pylon with. If the enemy is protoss, then I also have another probe at 15/16 just patrolling around the main and natural for cannons. Once I see the pylons/cannons, pull 5-6 probes per each (I know this is probably too much), and pay attention if I see a chance to surround their probe/s to kill them. In my second game after coming back I even got a zerg plant a proxy hatchery in my base. 

I lost too much to rushes in the beginning, until I started to know how to defend. That's how I climbed to gold 1. Then I started trying to play macro, but the opponent always went for the typical 3-4 base, mostly 1-unit composition (cyclones, mass void rays, battle cruisers, swarm hosts, etc.). I lost a lot of games in a row and that's when I realized these people didn't even scout me most of the time, and they amassed an army on 2-3-4 bases. So I started going 4gate (my old friend!) or 2 base 6-7 gate robo. 

Sometimes you can induce total rage on them, and see how they don't know how to maneuver out of their strategy. I saw a protoss going fast expand, so I planted a pylon in his expansion. He had to get a zealot out to kill it and by that time he was completely lost. He built two stargates with shield batteries just outside of my main. I warped 9-10 stalkers in my base and sent 5 zealots to his base. He didn't have any forces, and kept trying to attack me with his void rays. Boy was he enraged. 

It's a pity, though, because I'm quite good at going 1 base all-in, but that's not the game I want to play. Nor the early rushes. This evening, however, I plan to try PartinG's cannon/shield battery/immortal/warp prism rush against every zerg I encounter. It looks so strong and, if executed correctly (that's a big if), I doubt most platinum zergs will defend well against it.

Don't despair, watch some vids on how to defend against cannon rushes (once you kill their probes or get a couple stalkers out you have won), and if you want to practice sometime, I'm in EU but I'd be glad to play with you.

P.S.: you are right, it's really easier if you are the one attacking, as long as you don't suicide your whole army. Terran medivac drops... I still have some nightmares with those. Also, if they don't scout you, feel free to play cheesy strats."
allthingsprotoss,fm3djr0,t3_fssugz,1585719950.0,"I came back to the game after 9 years without playing. I was placed in Gold 3 and slowly made my way back up to Platinum 1-3, where I used to play in the past.

A lot of things have changed. I can't play macro on 3+ bases that well anymore (not yet!), but I can hold against most rushes and usually win with timed 1-2 base pushes (4-5gate all-in usually works because nowadays people in gold-plat tend to be so greedy, they take their 2nd but can't defend it properly the first 5-6 minutes).

However, for the sake of me, I have 0 idea on how to deal against mass cyclones and swarm hosts + nydus'es. Ok, proper scouting for the nyduses, and I hate SH because of the absurd range and the ability to kill a nexus without even exposing their units.

But against cyclones I've tried immortals (kited away), blink stalkers (kited away), colossus (obliterated by 15-20 cyclones) and archons (kited away). I'm completely on the same boat as you."
allthingsprotoss,fm3d75l,t1_fm2acrh,1585719631.0,"Well, in that case, I simply disagree. I think having to wait 11 seconds for a warp would nullify the effect of having a warp prism. I would not want to warp units on an enemy's base knowing he has 11 seconds to react, so I would not do it. I would not warp reinforcements in the middle of a battle either, because most of them dont last for 11 seconds, at which point it's basically over, for good or bad. A fast-warp warp prism gives you the chance to turn the odds in your favor. A slow one is (for me) worse than flipping a coin."

Coming back to your question... What do you need? A web application? A mobile app? A desktop application for your PC, or for your company?

This is very important, even if you don't go into the details, because the difference between a client-server infrastructure, a mobile or multi-platform app or a desktop one is a hell of a difference and completely changes the architecture you need.

&#x200B;

Do you need a database? Are you going to handle lots and lots of data? Are you going to have 10 clients or 100000?

Do you need your (I guess) app to work accross different platforms, like Windows/Linux/Mac OS? And do you need a mobile app as well, or maybe only the mobile app?

And, like these, there are several more questions that need answer before somebody can point you in the right direction.

You could go with something like React Native to build a web app with a Kotlin backend (for example), whereas you might only need Rust or C++ to build a desktop app. Building a RESTful backend and a mobile app is completely different from building an ad-hoc desktop app."

Models usually have hundreds of polygons (or triangles) that need to be rendered in order for them to look realistic.

If you had the same for hitboxes, then the geometric calculations to check if a bullet or enemy hits you would get riddiculously heavy and slow down the game by a lot.

Instead of that, the model keeps its hundreds of polygons, but simple geometric hitboxes, or combinations of them, are attached to them. For example, you might model a human with less than 10 hitboxes: one box for the head, another for the chest, 2 for arms, another 2 for upper legs and 2 for lower legs. Or even spheres instead of boxes.

As a result, instead of calculating vertex overlapping for hundreds of ¿vertexes? The calculation is reduced to intersections of simple shapes, like a box (a bullet, for example) vs another box or sphere, which is computationally very fast.

Hitboxes problems or complaints arise when the hitboxes don't match very well with the models. The player sees his character visually dodging something but since the hitbox is not perfect, he/she still receives damage."
