Dogs are created by humans to be exactly what we want them to be. Dogs of all kinds are bred to have sharper teeth and shit and when those dogs aren’t raised correctly, that’s when they bite. “All mailings are done by one breed” wrong, German Shepherds are just as likely as a pit bull to bite or maul a person. One of my close friends was mauled nearly to death by a GSD. Claiming that a dog just naturally does that is scientifically wrong. Pit bulls are nanny dogs, they are kind dogs until you INSTRUCT THEM TO HURT SOMEONE. “Innocent” people whose pit bulls bite do so because those people hit their dog in private. 

Look, I didn’t comment to start an argument with some person who has buried memories of bad memories with dogs and who lives in denial. Do some self reflecting and ask yourself why you had that link saved to send to someone the literal second they say a pit bull could be a nice dog. If you hate dogs why do you care so much? You realize hate is _always_ bred out of fear, right? Hate is an emotion engineered into humans to steer us away from dangerous things.

It was probably the most anxious I’ve ever been. I had anxiety sickness for weeks until I started telling (very few) people my side and getting barely any support. I felt like I was drowning.


Eventually I told my parents. They believed me and asked me if I wanted to call the police, but I felt like I couldn’t because there were no witnesses and what court would believe a male accusing a female friend of assault with no witnesses? So I just spent high school avoiding most of my friend groups because of that one person, until I decided that fuck it, I’m tired of this shit, and told her outright that I don’t forgive her but I’m tired of living my life in the shadows and for the last few months of high school I was actually happy.
