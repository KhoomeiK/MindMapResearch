At first it is like an extra bit of load on your brain distracting you from controlling the throttle, brake and steering as well as you would like but after changing gears starts to become 2nd nature you will begin to see situations where you can gain an advantage over what the auto setting would do. 

Shifting gears usually unsettles the car slightly so it is better to have a choice about when that happens. On the other side of the coin you may find yourself in situations where you actually want to slightly upset the rear end to gain better rotation. You also have the option of short shifting to avoid wheelspin or holding a gear longer because you are just about to brake or are at the limit of adhesion in a turn for example."
