I've been through this. I made so many excuses for him. I believed I loved him and we could fix it. It was all delusional. I wasted years of my life on a man who didn't give two fucks about me. He only cared about retaining control.

He'd fake nice his way through the times I knew I wanted to end it. He'd suddenly be the perfect husband. But it was always a temporary thing, used to put me back in my place.

I had no job, no money, no family -- nothing. I still left him. I left him standing in the living room with a huge butchers knife threatening to kill himself.

I didn't fucking care. I loaded up a Walmart bag with clothes and walked out. It was terrifying but it was also liberating. 

I was free. And once you're away from it for a bit -- you can finally understand the bullshit person he is.

Then we became exclusive and he turned into a horrible, abusive person -- exactly like your girl did to you. Constantly bringing me up just to stomp me down. I felt suicidal around him and he made me believe I was crazy.

I'm free now but not without hella consequences of course. I try to stay mindful of what's to come. You're 20 and I know it seems like shit all the time but you gotta keep an eye open for those tiny wonderful moments with your friends and even on your own.
