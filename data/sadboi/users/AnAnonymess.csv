Also, it’s not “stealing”. We’re not even providing the direct links to posts. We’re not interested in taking anyone else’s story for own, and that’s not what we’re doing.

Also, the definition of an internet troll according to Wikipedia: “In internet slang, a troll is a person who starts Flame wars or upsets people on the Internet by posting inflammatory and digressive, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into displaying emotional responses and normalizing tangential discussion, either for the troll's amusement or a specific gain.”

Looked through her history, and OP gives off the impression that she doesn’t have much in the way of life experience and may be rather naive and sheltered. With it, I imagine she’s pretty lacking in confidence, at least in regards to vocalizing her thoughts, as well as difficultly grasping the understanding that other families are going to have different dynamics.

I wholeheartedly agree that she ought to be an adult and speak up about how the dirty jokes make her uncomfortable. Either that, or simply stop going over to visit.

*Edit 1/18/2020: Last night around 1am I called a mental health services hotline that had been recommended to us by the last therapist we took 6 to see. I was given many options for mental health professionals for both my husband and I to visit. I have left a few voicemails requesting an appointment. Her father and I had a very long and exhausting discussion regarding our plan of action that basically involves kicking her out and cutting ties. As many of you already know, I am very stupid and this is difficult for me to process. My husband is more sane regarding 6, he was just following my lead as neither of us really knew what to do with 6. Monday we are scheduling a meeting with a lawyer to discuss all of our options pertaining to the car sale and the start of evicting 6 and DK. I still love her dearly and despite what it may appear I do deeply love my older children too. That being said, yes, I am an asshole and yes, the older 5 are absolutely better off without me in their lives. It has been made abundantly clear that I have lost all of them. I've known for a long while now deep down that my hopes for a proper relationship with 6 are dead, failure to remove the infection in the finger has led to the whole hand being amputated. Regarding the older 5, I am keeping them out of this, I am going to stay out of their lives unless invited back.*

*I stumbled into motherhood and I thought I caught myself and was turning it into something more like a dance but, I have let maybe its pride or laziness I'm not sure blind me to the poison I was feeding my family. I knew something was going to give and I did nothing. All in all, I can say that 6 was the problem but in all reality and seriousness, it was me from the get go.*

*Thank you for your comments and for calling me out. I appreciate the tough love and I appreciate those of you who have lived through something like this and allowed me to view the situation from the other side. I was looking for sympathy and validation, I believe I have received something better though it is shameful to admit I am such a failure I have heard that the first step healing is admitting you have a problem. I have a problem and I need help and I appreciate the help you have given.*

*Thank you.*

It legitimately does seem like the comments got through to her. This was such a sad story, and I feel so bad for the other siblings and, hell, even the parents to some extent. OP and her husband did a great disservice to that girl, and now she’s just... ruined. You hear the phrase “throw out the whole child/person” as a joke, but it seems like this is legitimate advice for this situation.

I hope OP changes her ways for good and cuts out the cancer. Maybe eventually, hopefully, she and her other children can reconnect and live happier lives. In a perfect world..."

But *no one* gives this woman a heads up, not until a tiny human waltzes out of the nether and calls her husband “granddad”. You honestly had no idea that she’d react so negatively to being put on the spot like that? Really? How daft are you?

One of the commenters stated how awful that this woman couldn’t just stop to appreciate the child. Dude... It was a bombshell that came outta nowhere. If this had happened to one of the OPs, y’all all be clamoring over how insensitive and tactless the parents/siblings/in-laws were.

JustNoTruth,feik6uu,t1_feignoq,1579140431.0,"Exactly this. BPD oftentimes manifests because of abandonment or perceived abandonment at a young, impressionable age. Honestly, reading through her post oddly *makes sense* to me, because borders can have these types of feelings often, but I’m also not so lacking in self-awareness to not see it as just plain wrong too. You don’t come out and *say* those feelings, because they were never true. Your illness is just messing with your perception of reality."
JustNoTruth,feijjmb,t1_feiac1w,1579139996.0,"Border chiming in. If you explain your symptoms, most doctors do try to label you right away. I was given a diagnosis of BPD (or “traits”, as she dubbed it) when I met my first psychiatrist about four or five years ago, but she had a history provided to her by my mother and myself. She was arrogant too, of course, but she was also right.

Realistically, as there’s no official test”for BPD, it’s supposed to take several sessions with a therapist, best done if you are completely honest and open (especially about childhood) and see them frequently (maybe once a week). I suppose it could have been an emergency diagnosis, done in a hospital psych ward, like YouAreTheJustNo suggested, but extreme symptoms are more commonly written off as bipolar disorder, as it’s easy to misdiagnose one for the other (or have both...)

*If* OP isn’t a troll (and I’m willing to bet they are), considering how much she’s willing to overshare and split— a term commonly used in the BPD Reddit community to give a name to an emotional whiplash feeling of love and hate over a person— it’s very possible her extreme behavior is what more easily got her the diagnosis. *If* she is a troll, she seems to have done her homework, because she kind of hits the symptoms on the head from what I can decipher.

Troll or not though, she’s a pisspoor excuse of a mother and human being. I can personally assure you not all borderlines are this batshit."
JustNoTruth,fedu1zs,t1_fed4bhp,1579019894.0,"Exactly. I went through her post history too, where she commented on a post about going to couple’s therapy alone. It seems OP has a lot of built up resentment for her partner that hasn’t yet gotten resolved because he just lacks understanding. Or maybe his anxiety or FOG just won’t allow him to hear it? In either case, that spells pretty bad for OP. It’s such a shame because it appears she’s wasted literal years on this relationship."

I don’t see anything wrong with your comment at all. I think it’s quite reasonable. I guess it could be considered ‘MILpologizing’ (a really stupid term imo)? But, y’know, you aren’t allowed to give a differing opinion inside of an echo chamber, even if you say nicely and respectively."
JustNoTruth,fdfuwyt,t1_fdfkmvx,1578370866.0,"Yeah, I went a read both of her posts, the one on JNMIL and RBN. That was so sad. Poor thing feels her childhood was so painfully empty of happy memories because of her parents’ oppression.

But I believe it. That kind of control really does happen. It’s especially prevalent with Christian families. Growing up, I’ve had quite a few friends that had what I had thought were strange rules and really overbearing mothers. I also have aunt who’s religious and a certifiable nutcase. I actually wouldn’t be surprised if she were to stumble onto a post like OP’s and take freakin’ notes."
JustNoTruth,fdfu97d,t3_el3swx,1578370369.0,"Okay, so I read through it. I gotta say, I don’t see many major red flags with this sadly. And I say “sadly” because, wow, OP’s story was just heartbreaking. The unfortunate thing is, all of events in her story are entirely plausible.

Nothing against homeschooling— if it works for you/your kids, then have at it— but it makes it, well, especially easy for parents who are abusive and controlling to have access to the victim in question. Because social interaction is dictated entirely by the parent, they can severely limit you and sort of hide you away from the world. Unless maybe there’s a call to CPS, there’s really no one else that sees and talks with the kid on a regular basis, so there’s no one really looking out for them. 

Throw religious fanaticism into the mix, and it gives a narc the ability to hide behind God. And unless others in her congregation know her or are just hypocrites themselves, it’s nearly guaranteed to make YOU seem like the asshole in the situation. You become a damned heathen, or they shout the commandment “hOnOr ThY fAtHeR aNd MoThEr!!!!1” over and over.

Update NINE?!

Then I actually read through it. Oh, it’s a court update-type post. I can’t really say one way or the other on the validity of those, because I’m not well-versed on how the court system works besides a very basic understanding. Truthfully, I do find myself a tad wary when posters include the legal system, but this seems legit on surface level. I’d have to go back to the previous posts to maybe get a better feel.

The brief mention of the bias judge favoring the MIL sort of sets of a tiny alarm though. As for the quote, it’s either quite poetic or ironic. There’s no way to truly tell, sadly."

That’s a very fair point, and I agree. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to suggest that the relationship go on without consequence or anything. I suppose I rather felt for the OP because I have a best friend who wants and tries to talk through her problems with her family despite their (light) toxic behaviors, so I could sort of understand from that point of view. OP seems naive but stubborn, much like my friend, and perhaps I had let that comparison cloud my judgement.

But you are right, it’s not a good idea to try force your spouse’s hand when they just don’t want to. The OP, unfortunately, was just not looking for that kind of advice, but I did suggest (in the original post) that she either step back or try therapy with her husband, but to ultimately leave the decision up to him."
