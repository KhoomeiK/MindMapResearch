mentalhealth,fqa6dsu,t3_ghnlkv,1589213625.0,"I went to therapy for a year after my first major psychotic episode and thought it wasn’t for me. The first handful of psychiatrists were also not at all what I needed. I nearly gave up but I found an amazing psychiatrist and it took him 2 or 3 years to convince me to try therapy again. The therapist he recommended has been my therapist for 3 years now and she’s the best thing that ever happened to me. 

Don’t give up kids. If you think therapy isn’t for you then chances are you haven’t found the right therapist! 

Congrats op! It takes a lot of bravery to admit your faults and seek help. Keep working hard man"
Psychosis,fqa4cro,t3_gho65y,1589212596.0,"As strange and complicated psychosis, sometimes your brain makes all sorts of connections. Suddenly far fetched and “crazy” conspiracies make perfect sense. I’m not saying this to hurt your feelings, but I think your mind is trying to justify the pain you’re in. Normally how I gauge if something is related to my psychosis I ask myself if I could say it out loud to someone and convince them of my truth. If the answer is probably not then odds are I’m delusional. 

Bottom line is you _don’t_ deserve to be in pain. Keep taking your meds and going to therapy and hopefully with time you’ll come to accept that this is probably just a symptom of the disorder. 

Stay safe my friend xx"

My parents had the financial means for therapy but never considered it legitimate till I was already an adult. Did you check if the online counseling had age restrictions?

Repeatedly checking things and having “irrational” thoughts about “if I did this then that will surely happen” both sound like ocd.  

You said you can’t go to a therapist, are you a minor?"
Psychosis,fov7r6z,t1_folont4,1588096757.0,"I had 2 lightbulb moments but they weren’t as helpful as you might think. The first one I had was the one that showed me I’m hallucinating. I was talking to my sister and mid conversation she disappeared. It truly broke me. I withdrew even more after that cuz I was too skeptical of everything, I was worried someone might see me talking to the air or something. The second one was regarding a delusion; I thought I’d die before the age of 19 (or 20 maybe- my memory is crap) and on my birthday I felt as if my world is shattered. It’s like waking up one day and finding out that you don’t actually live on earth, you live on mars and everyone but you already knows that. The light bulbs moments didn’t stop my psychosis it just made me feel desperate and alone. 

I don’t think of them as lies though, they’re my reality. Reality is so subjective and I still struggle to see what others see I guess. Wether it’s a dark entity or not it doesn’t change anything. I used to think that it might be but it doesn’t really matter when the end result is the same. 

Medication and therapy really help. The first couple of doctors and therapists didn’t but when I found what works for me I held on with everything I have lol. Being around people I trust helps too, I see if they react to what I see and if they don’t it’s a clear sign for me that it may be a hallucination. The only downside to that plan is when I believe the people I’m with aren’t actually the people I know, that they’re from a different reality playing a joke on me. When I reach this point of paranoia logic does jack shit. I’m still tryin to figure it out"
Psychosis,fov62ii,t1_fonscc3,1588095974.0,Thanks! I don’t believe I’ll ever be the person I was before. Even when my psychosis is manageable I constantly doubt my reality. Tbh I gave up on trying to be my “normal” self. I try not to think about it

Psychosis,fonpw9n,t1_fon25is,1587924156.0,"Hey it gets easier. I’m not the same person. I’ve had multiple psychotic episodes and it feels like my brain is forever changed. I lost all my emotions after my first major psychotic episode, I was a shell of a human. I got my emotions back after maybe a year and I didn’t know how to function with them. My emotions aren’t as strong as they used to be but it is better. I lost a lot of my passion but I do have some passion left. 

My first major psychotic episode was during my first year of uni. I have graduated from computer engineering and got promoted just last month at work. I still have psychosis but it’s much better now. I truly never thought I’d survive for as long as I have but believe me when I say IT GETS BETTER! 

Ps: I’m still on antipsychotics. I was put on meds when I was 18/19 and I’m now nearly 25. I don’t think I’m gonna get off of them anytime soon cuz so far all my attempts to get off meds worsened my psychosis/depression quite a lot"
Psychosis,folnhox,t1_fokxlwx,1587866113.0,No clue what the commenter said but does your friend have security cameras in his house/building?
Psychosis,foln926,t3_g801bd,1587865959.0,"1) loaded question 
Do you know a time before he was psychotic? If he told you about the abuse before he lost touch with reality then it’s probably not psychosis. You mentioned that you thought he had ADHD as a kid, he might have it. I have adhd/add and psychosis so they’re not mutually exclusive. 
Idk what causes psychosis but stressful situations always make it worse for me, you mentioned weed as well which sadly isn’t great for psychosis either. 

2)
Switching from one thought to the other as if “nothing has happened” is easy when you’re mind is a mess. Sometimes I feel like my thoughts are floating in my head so fast I can’t grasp one long enough to actually think it. I visually see them all over. Thoughts are weird and they float all around. 

3) DO NOT GO ALONG WITH HIS DELUSIONS! listen you can respect him and not look down on him without worsening his delusions. My tip is to not outright say “that’s just not true” instead try to challenge him in a way that doesn’t show that you’re 100% sure of your stance if that makes sense. I’m sorry if this is confusing, personally when people tell me a delusion of mine is wrong or whatever and I see that there’s no way of “convincing” them then I’m either gonna doubt them or save my breath. It makes me believe in my delusions even more. 

4) what you mentioned doesn’t mean he’s suicidal. He may be but not based on thinking that he’s leaving clues behind before he gets killed. I remember writing a will when I was in 8th grade with a list of all my books and who they’re going to. I wasn’t suicidal back then just delusional in thinking someone is out to get me. 




Do you know what his diagnosis is? Is he medicated? Not being able to sleep is only gonna make it worst he truly needs antipsychotics"

>News regarding a girl born in 2000 with the name Malak (Angel) Haidar Alzubaidy is all over social media. She’s been burned ruthlessly and the victim’s sister made a post accusing the husband and his family, whose related to deputy Humaid AlMahi, of burning the victim and preventing her from visiting her family for approximately 8 months. 

>*picture of the post made by the sister*
[i don’t understand most of it but here are the sentences I could read]
...I just want you to know that this word and law is between us and you Ahmad (the husband?) your punishment/karma will be tough and I have conversations proving you harmed her and imprison her. I’m a lady and you’re a big man. 

>*pictures of the victim in a hospital bed*

>There are pictures and videos circling social media of Malak (the victim) before and after being burned, it shows a painful video of Malak screaming in pain from the burns she sustained.

>*tweet of the video*
Tweet in white reads: “any girl needs to share this case. Anyone who shares this video, god forbid one day you face the same situation she did and you become a victim of this sick society. To any guy, imagine this is your sister is the victim, would you share this? This needs to be in the court of public opinion, we all need to pitch in and help by re-tweeting. #Malak_Haidar_Alzubaidy”

>Tweet in black: “#deputy Humaid AlMahi and his family burn their sons wife. Born in the year 2000, she’s been burned by her husbands family and prohibited from visiting her family for 8 months, they claimed ‘we’re the sons of the deputy, no one can punish us’.

>In the yellow block: the mother of Malak (the victim) tells the details of the story regarding the attack.

>The story has been shared though social media in rage, in an attempt to bring this to the court of public opinion for an investigation into the attack to take place and to seer justice being served. The victims mother stated that when she went to see her daughter in the hospital, the victims mother in law prevented her from going in to see her daughter. the mother claimed that her son in law and his father gave contradicting statements, which made her doubt the authenticity of the situation. She revealed that the investigation used statements made by the victims father in law and not the victim herself. 

>A tweet by a lawyer named Mohamad Alkandery regarding the mother’s claims stated: “changing the [statement?] is clear and possible in a corrupt country. The victims father in law is a deputy, meaning collusion is possible, so the only possible solution is to open a criminal investigation, a medical investigation and a full report of the type of burns, which product was used to burn the victim, the burn degree, the amount of damage caused, and the manor of the burn wether its by suicide or by another person. Fingers point to the husband!! He is the reason [idk?]”

>Tweet by Mustadfa:
“The mother of the victim though channel [channel name] recorded in the investigation quarters [idk]

>Video of the mother: 
- Mother: Around Sunset prayers, maybe an hour after, her husband called me from the hospital and said your daughter is in the hospital. She has minor burns come, come. I can hear the sounds of the ER, I can hear her.
- Interviewer: He didn’t tell you how she got burned?
- Mother: when i first walked in I asked, what’s wrong with her my son? The father is saying one thing, the son is saying another. The son is saying she tried to kill herself, the father is saying ..[interviewer spoke over her]..
- Interviewer: There were contradictions
- Mother: there were contradictions with their statements. His mother was inside. Inside where they were cleaning the burns. They would let me, the mom tried her best not to let me inside, didn’t want me to see the situation. She wouldn’t let me reach my daughter. While they were pushing me i saw my daughter from afar, she was laying down and they were cleaning her body.
- Interviewer: what was the reason she didn’t want you in?
- Mother: That’s why  I was suspicious, I’m her mother. How’re you (the victims mother in law) inside and I’m outside. I’m the mother. Why? The mother in law was saying your daughter will be all healed in no time. Just like that. Two days and she’ll be ok. I told her all that yelling and screaming, how’re you saying she’ll be healed in no time, don’t you hear all the screaming.
- Interviewer: the girl is burned and she’s saying she’ll heal in no time?
- Mother: that’s what she said, in no time. There’s nothing wrong with your daughter she’ll heal in no time.
[screen cuts for a fraction of a second]
- mother: the official statements, it wasn’t taken by my daughter, it was taken by his dad! (The father in law). They asked him and he said she’s my daughter (as in the father in law told them that the victim is HIS daughter). He took it in his own hand, he works in the forces. The official statements are wrong, it’s not true. My daughter’s 10 fingers are burned, how could she sign the statement? Who signed the statement? They took the statement and ran with it, its all the father’s responsibility."

I had psychosis growing up but honestly didn’t even think of it as psychosis as I haven’t seen a professional at the time and thought my delusions and having a man in my head was normal. Long story short i was going through a rough time mentally and my psychosis came out of nowhere. Started small and kept getting worst till I couldn’t sleep due to all the voices and other shit like that. 

I’m diagnosed with psychotic depression now. Getting on antipsychotics helped so fucking much and it’s a lot easier to manage. I know with this whole covid shit it’s hard to get the help you need but talk to your therapist about setting phone sessions. I’m FaceTiming my therapist once a week now, see if you can arrange to do the same.

If so then it may be intrusive thoughts. Idk if the other things you mentioned are delusions/hallucinations, I’ve never experienced what you described but I can’t say they’re not. People experience psychosis differently. Do you have any other diagnosis aside from schizoaffective?"
