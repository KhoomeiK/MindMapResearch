CPTSD,fn5shzj,t3_fzo2ov,1586674367.0,"It is not an excuse. I agree with you. My sister treated me badly growing up, I'd say she was bossy and attention seeking. But she changed and I don't really hold her accountable for her actions then as she didn't know better as a child. Late teens/adult? She should have known better though, but she has come forward and admitted her behaviour was wrong and because she was insecure and envious of me.

My dad, who I would call a narcissist (not going to claim NPD though, just narcissistic traits as he was never diagnosed with anything even though he had a lot wrong mentally) got cancer and literally suffered in agony until he died. He could not breathe, eat, sleep, go to the bathroom on his own he was so weak. Did he deserve it? Sure, as much as any smoker deserves to die early of cancer when they ignore the warnings. And 100% I would say I'm glad he's gone, but his suffering didn't bring me closure. Talking to him was more likely to result in gaslighting anyway.

And I know you're angry that you have been hurt so bad...  I totally understand where you are coming from... but rage isn't the answer. Viewing everyone that hurt you as all bad is cognitive dissonance, black and white thinking, which ends up distorting your views more and fueling your rage.

Denial - Anger - Depression - Bargaining - Acceptance, the stages of grief, extends to abuse survivors as well. You grieve the childhood you lost, the parents you never had. We are all at different stages of this process, and can cycle through previous stages before we reach acceptance."

A number of weeks ago after a new friend invited me out, I had this same thing happen. As soon as I was dropped off at home and I was finally alone I began to sob and felt sick. 

I worried like maybe they were manipulating me-- I looked for something *wrong* with their kindness, or something off. Since childhood I have felt like kindness was conditional.

Then I questioned why I felt threatened because they were only nice to me. I realised it was all in my head and people are allowed to want to be my friend, and I am likable. And so are you!"
abuse,fn3vzl3,t3_fz1zlg,1586628998.0,"Hi there. I am a victim of child-on-child sexual abuse (COCSA), and when I was 14... I had the first thought that maybe I was being molested in some way... but dismissed it because I couldn't tell on her. She was unpredictable and vengeful.

Our home life was abusive, too. She was very insecure and bullied me at home behind closed doors all the time. She was jealous that I would do things with my life that she felt she couldn't because she always suffered severe anxiety, and I was more carefree.

 As her twin sister she often said we were the same person, so it didn't matter. I didn't want to be on her bad side as she had the tendency to get violent if I didn't do what she wanted.

 I went along with it because it was sort of a weird game she'd want to ""play"" when our parents left the house. We were left alone for many hours at times, as both parents worked. Usually, these games involved me having to pretend to be a guy she liked, i remember dissocciating so much it became my default state. Then when the guy I liked in early highschool rejected me, she started it again, this time telling me to express my love to a crush I had and pretended to be that guy. Ugh, the icky cringy dirtiness that I felt. We had bunk beds but she'd never sleep on the top bunk ever. Why was I okay with this? I often ask. Why didn't I say no?

It would stop for a while and I'd get my space finally, and start again when something major happened in life that hurt me. It was like she took advantage of my vulnerable state to use me for her own benefit.

 It has been a hard road to recover to the point I can even type it out like this. But you do not deserve to feel such shame. With harmful sexual behaviours, children sometimes become fixated on it, like a nervous habit they can't control. It's not your fault just know that.

If you need any guidance on how to move past this in life feel free to message me. I'm sorry you are struggling so much you definitely do not deserve it."
adultsurvivors,fn3tnci,t1_fn2bxej,1586627685.0,"Covert sexual abuse messes with you just the same. It blurs the lines between platonic love and sexuality, which makes it very confusing as children when we start puberty and have all these urges we don't understand. You only did what you were taught was normal and had no idea of the consequences of your actions. Children often do not understand cause and effect. 

Exploring sexuality is normal. There are harmful sexual behaviours between children (intercourse and other sexual acts) and then there is normal sexual behaviours during childhood development (playing doctor, practicing kissing, spin the bottle, exploring their bodies, etc) it's a huge chemical change in the body during that time which makes it difficult to control the impulses.

It doesn't affect you any less or make you a bad person.

This post, the last paragraph in particular, shows you have come a long way in recovery by awknowledging exactly who's responsible for your feelings of rejection (your dad), and that mourning a relative is the normal *human* thing to do.

Sometimes having a disorder that is misunderstood by your caretaker or peers can result in abuse, which will cause your PTSD to be comorbid with other things, like ADHD for example. Or schizophrenia.

DID is said to be caused by a repeated trauma where dissociation is the only escape, to the point the dissocciative states take over and become seperate personalities, protecting the true self through layers of masks that pertain to the abuse they experienced."

 I didn't like myself. I thought people wouldn't like *me* or judge me as some kind of messed up freak... So if they judged my persona, then the real me was protected from rejection.

The Family Guy episode where Meg finally stands up for herself is great until she is gaslit into being the scapegoat again. I guess they can't change the dynamic of the show but it made me angry that it seemed they were basically saying ""yeah, we're shit and you have valid points to back that up.... But shut up, Meg."" And she was pretty much like ""You know what? you're right. Shut up, me."" 

People don't know what it's like to be told ""shut up"" all the time, or to be made to feel insignificant. They can't empathise because they've never lived it.

survivorsofabuse,fmmf7ot,t1_fmm8dq0,1586204182.0,"It's kind of traumatic in itself to process the fact you were abused, and it's sooo easy to blame yourself. When I got out of my abusive home it was like someone finally turned on the lights and I could finally see the mess that was my life. Keep reminding yourself that none of this is your fault and you deserve far better than to live in such terrible conditions. You deserve support and nurturing, someone that actually cares about you... you definitely do not deserve being mocked, molested, and beaten.

If taking video or audio of the abuse is not possible, don't push it if it risks your safety. Just write down what you can. The people really at fault here are your parents, just focus on what they did in response to what you experienced from being abused.

You do raise valid points about how limiting it is to be under 18 in such an awful situation, and I'm sorry that you are going through all this. Indeed it does seem like a huge step, especially when you are only 16, and the world seems like a scary place. All you've known is that people are not trustworthy, because when you trusted them too much you ended up hurt. I know how that feels because I just got out of an abusive work environment, after growing up in a similarly abusive home. I had a pretty shit life, nothing compared to what you've been through, but trauma is still trauma.

My abuse went from just physical and emotional to sexual when I was 11, and continued this way into my late teens, early 20s. Most abuse turned to physical violence and the sexual abuse stopped when I was in my early 20s. I'm 29 now and as much as we want to just forget about it, sometimes we can't and your mind and body will not let you. That's okay if that happens. That's why therapists are there, to helps you mend psychological injuries, just like a physiotherapist helps you heal physical injuries. It would do you a world of good. But it also can take a long time to unlearn every toxic thing you were taught. And when you are young, it is a lot easier to find programmes and funding than it is to wait 10+ years until you can't take it anymore. As a 29 y/o woman finding therapy that's affordable, finding mental health services, etc... It's quite difficult and I wish I had reached out sooner, honestly.

What you tell the shelter is exactly what you told us all here. A social worker can help you find your treatment plan and help you so you don't end up on the streets. I know how terrifying it is to know you need to get away from your family, but it's so important to your recovery that you do talk about it so your mind can properly process it, otherwise trauma can lead to drug abuse to escape the pain, and homelessness from giving up on themselves. I do not want that for you, I want you to be happy and healthy.

I'd start by emailing some people in some of the organisations below regarding information about what you need to do as a minor experiencing abuse, and how to get the help you need.

adhdwomen,fmma4rk,t3_fvz6sd,1586201597.0,"I feel your pain. I am in a similar boat. Not having a routine really gets to me. I forgot about my boyfriends coffee in the microwave the other day for like 6 hours and when I saw it in there I thought he'd gone and heated it up. Nope! I literally just never gave it to him. I heated it up again of course and he said it was still delicious, so it was all good.

One thing that helps me is I started setting reminders on my phone or Google Home. I don't think I'd remember anything without them...Then are the times I will forget about them or get distracted and next thing I know the food in the oven is burnt, the pot on the stove's boiling over, I forgot to flush the toilet, every light in the house is on, and my tea I tried to make myself is still sitting on the counter, ice cold and strong enough to stand up a spoon because I left the bag in.

ADHD is a neurobiological condition. Are you on medication for it? Is your mother actively trying to help you with your needs so you can get things done, is she even aware of what ADHD is, or is she dismissive? Seems like the latter as she unfairly blames your dysfunction on you instead of the executive functioning problems everyone with ADHD experiences, especially task initiation or prioritising tasks.

 It's her responsibility as your parent to take care of your needs, including making sure you have the means of dealing with your ADHD, and actually understanding you. She's invalidating you by judging your lack of initiative as intentional. Similar response from parents/authority figures leads to a lot of us developing Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, a not-so-fun addition to our already existing emotional struggles.

survivorsofabuse,fmlttu6,t3_fvhl2k,1586193110.0,"Let me be honest with you, i creeped your profile and read some of your other posts. I am so sorry that your life has been such hell. You are so strong and brave to still be here after experiencing all that. For actually opening up online, even anonymously, shows that you have always known that the way you have been treated is wrong. You just needed to hear it. 

You having emotions is not you being a baby. It's a natural, human thing. Your parents have poisoned your mind so that you hate yourself. They mocked and shamed you for being a child with feelings, which breaks my heart. Peeing your pants, any normal person would be concerned that their kid started peeing themselves when they did not before.. It sounds like your parents a psychopaths and break you down any chance they can because they actually hate themselves. Your mother insults your body and calls you a whore for what, having breasts that your parents' genetics gave you? She's jealous of her own child for something out of her, or her child's control..  who even thinks that way for real?! They have no boundaries, no respect.

You seem like you have such a kind heart and have been through so much hell. I am sorry that people have taken advantage of you so many times. People who hurt others look for insecurities so they can exploit those who may be vulnerable for whatever selfish reasons they may have. That doesn't make you bad, that doesn't make you nothing. It doesn't mean you're pathetic and destined to be a victim.

Record them when they get abusive on audio or video if possible and maybe save the videos in a different folder or move the videos to a cloud service so if they check your phone they won't see it. Take your posts here and use them as evidence too. If you can remember any names of your other abusers, locations, times or dates, write it down. Especially those teachers! :( 

 Begin planning an exit plan, with a private email reach out to women's shelters in your area who can help plan your exit strategy. Open up your own bank account and ask your employer to change your direct deposit information. Have a go bag with the belongings you can't bear to part with ready to go, hide it where you might easily access it if you need to leave immediately.

 When you are ready, to the police with your evidence against your abusers, and never go back to them no matter how much they try to manipulate you to come back. I don't know what country you're in but there is assistance for victims of crime in Canada that covers your sessions with a therapist as well. I'm sure there may be similar in other places, too. 

Best of luck to you ðŸ’œ"
ADHD,fmldynf,t3_fvxrwp,1586184483.0,"No, you're not lazy. Task initiation is part of executive functioning, which is what ADHD struggles with a lot. Adderall will help with energy levels needed to complete a task, or at least actually get it started. 

Without meds I get extremely overwhelmed by even trying to start the dishes or sweep the floor. It's like when I think of the fact I need to do a thing, I will not act and just take mental note that I'll do it later, then I just... forget about it. I don't even think about the fact I can do the thing right now, or which tasks to prioritise over others. Hyper-focus is also part of our dysregulation of our executive functioning as well, as tasks that give us more of an immediate reward tend to be addictive to our dopamine-starved brains, thus we can also have *too much* motivation and focus on one thing and neglect all others.

Having a to-do list or post-it notes can be helpful. Or using your phone with reminders and alarms to remind you of the things that you have to do, and what tasks are a priority.

The likely reason you only do things you have to do is because of what I mentioned above too. The optional tasks are not interesting or rewarding enough and probably add to the feeling of being overwhelmed, so avoiding the tasks is your way of coping with that."

Saying no could be a negative outcome for your mental health and saying yes could be a negative outcome for her career. 

Being cryptic with the answer is the best course of action for her, as she probably has developed this response as a protocol for clients experiencing transference of their emotions onto the therapist, which is actually quite common.

And edit: forgot to add that yes your therapist cares about you, but she needs professional and personal boundaries with clients, which does not mean she doesn't care, it just means she has boundaries."

Sorry to piggy back on this but... Please u/--Heyo-- hear me out. If you believed this, really, you wouldn't be posting here.

Based on my experience with mental health it seems that your relationship only further solidified some ideas you seem to have had before this, such as maybe a mother who is toxic. And despite you only having limited experience with women, you sort of need to hear that's fact because it's comforting in a way because you have explained why you seem to be treated that way... which is why you no longer care. (If you didn't care why did you post here?)

If I am incorrect about the above... what experiences with women have you had outside of your abusive relationship that could validate the idea that all women are as you say?

 Trust me that in which you have experienced is not normal behaviour for *anyone*. Women are individuals just as complex as you are, they are not to be lumped into some cookie-cutter persona. It sounds like your ex has a severe mental health problem and that is not **your** fault, and most definitely is **not** an example of all women. It does **not** mean you deserved to be abused.

And there is no shame in having emotions or needing help. I think you would benefit immensely from therapy. You deserve to be loved and to love someone that actually cares about you, and you also deserve to know that you deserve that. The right girl exists, please don't let your experience push the right person away.

I wish you all the best. Please look at the links I put at the top of this post."
KindVoice,fm0w2or,t3_fs7bkj,1585667308.0,"It's cliche but you have to love yourself before you can love another. You were in an abusive relationship. There are plenty of resources here on Reddit that can help you.

Seeking therapy or counseling is important, 100% before you enter another relationship.

It's normal to want to protect yourself from more hurt but projecting these feelings of distrust on all women may even lead to you abusing in future relationships, as you are blaming all women for the actions of your abuser.

**A healthy relationship relies on:**

- **Mutual Respect** - you and your partner should respect each other as individuals, as well as respecting each other's boundaries and personal safety (refuse to abuse)

- **Trust** - you have to trust your partner will not hurt you and has your needs in their best interest. Show them respect and you will earn their trust. It goes both ways.

- **Communication** if you fail to communicate problems arise. Never assume, always communicate with open honesty. Be truthful and treat others how you would like to be treated (goes both ways obviously).

- **Emotional support** - you and your partner should be there for one another in times of hardship, through the good and the bad. 

- **Cooperation & comprise** Problem solving in a fair way. Preferably win win scenarios, but understanding that it doesn't have to always be your way and vice versa. 

- **Responsibility** being able to admit when you are wrong, and being accountable for your actions and attitudes."

Personally I think you should take the referral. Go in and speak with the therapist you were referred to and give them a chance, then make your decision. Your therapist only did this because it is the best course of action for your recovery. 

Please understand that your therapist is a working professional and isn't necessarily there to be a friend, they are there to help you recover from a psychological injury just as a physiotherapist is there to help you recover from a physical injury. If they are not trained in what you're going through, you won't make much progress or it can get worse. 

Imagine you keep getting painful headaches. You go to your GP. You tell your GP your symptoms and they refer you to a neurologist. It's not that your doctor thinks you're worthless, they just don't have the necessary education to treat your condition.


Plus, you're talking about personal problems that you may have never told the world. Many people find themselves emotionally attached to their therapists, it is known as *transference*, it's normal.

I suggest that you might even communicate this to the referenced therapist so they might be able to help you work on the projection you are feeling."

Remember if she's begging forgiveness and verbally abusing you at the same time, it's all manipulative bullshit. You may love her but she never truly loved you like you loved her. She seems like she's incapable of that, especially laughing like cheating on your spouse is a funny joke? What the...

If she's like that, your future children would have probably suffered because of her selfishness as well. You did yourself, and them, a favour.

You deserve so much better. And so do they."

Actually last night my partner and I tried to have sex 2 or 3 times without success as I kept going numb and dissociating. Last night I had a sex dream where I dealt with the same issue. It's like my body is afraid to be turned on especially when I'm with someone.


 I think communication with your partner is important in overcoming the sex issues. I think it'll take a lot of patience and understanding from both you and them, because it will take time to unlearn what your body has been conditioned for (dissociation). I often need to be stoned or drunk to enjoy myself. I feel like I can give easily and that will turn me on to see my partner turned on, but when he returns the favour it's hard to stay in my body. I freeze, my brain wanders to dark places and I just go numb. 

I feel awful because he always asks if it's something he did wrong, I assure him it's not him. I recently have been opening up about the abuse to him and he's been super understanding and kind to me, and lets me know I'm safe with him. I just feel really terrible that he can't enjoy a normal sex life either because he's worried about me."

So he learns everything he can about it so he might get a taste of what it's like to feel happy, love .. even sad or angry. I relate to his struggle because with years of feeling entirely numb.... Each emotion I can allow myself to feel is fleeting, so it's a fight sometimes to feel"
nextfuckinglevel,flktdnc,t1_flko5jh,1585247323.0,"I fully agree that the government is to blame. But I also think we need personal responsibility too. There are people who don't care, support governments that deny climate change and give tax cuts to the rich and make our lives harder, support the building of pipelines and industry that threatens fragile ecosystems, and deny science.

 We as consumers are accountable for our own actions too. We need to think for ourselves, and whether or not we support companies and governments that are damaging our planet, the price gouging of environmentally friendly options, and the politics that encourage them. 

We are not entirely powerless, if we can band together against climate change as we have over COVID-19... Prove to the government climate change is serious and needs immediate action. They've proven it's possible for immediate action in the face of a global pandemic... The governments taking forever to actually do something about climate change seems like they're just making petty excuses. The threat of climate change is far more deadly than this virus, we could do so much if humanity could pull their heads out of their asses."
CPTSD,fizbtep,t3_famj8n,1582858910.0,"From my understanding, the body's stress response decreases activity in the area of the brain that processes speech, decision making, executive functioning, etc, in favour of survival, so when people are scared they tend to struggle to find the words for things. 

When I get anxious or depressed, or triggered, I tend to get quiet. Sometimes i have trouble speaking and it's like a lump in my throat trying to communicate more than a word. Sometimes I can't say anything at all. Actually normally my words just get jumbled up and I can never seem to get my thoughts into words"
CPTSD,fiu7jcp,t3_f9vnz4,1582736476.0,"I'm an artist too and my sister used to get so jealous of my art she would demand me to stop. I remember her having a total meltdown because she felt like my art was better than hers, even though I practiced more.

 She would scorn me when I was doing anything other than paying attention to her. Espec if she thought I was better than her at something. She'd always complain about how often I'd draw, I often wished she'd leave me alone to do my own thing.

After my mum sided with her one meltdown and essentially asked me if I could not draw in front of her anymore... I think the spark inside me died out because doing any art now is a struggle, and I can't focus anymore and always try to push it to ""later"". I find myself avoiding working on art often. :/"
