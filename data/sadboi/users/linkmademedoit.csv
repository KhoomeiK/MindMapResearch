BipolarReddit,fnp2kx2,t3_g2xb6o,1587138129.0,"I (F28) want children and we plan on starting to try next year. I continue to talk to my doctor about it so we have a plan. I am scared of passing on my genes but I think of it this way, I now understand the signs I displayed as a young child and teenager that I had mental health issues. As someone who has experienced that and knows what to look for, I feel more prepared to catch it as early as possible if it does happen and help my child through it. If mental health issues don't present until adulthood, I'll be prepared for that too and work through getting my child help as I need. The percentage is relatively low. And there is no guarantee that if you pass on the disorder it will present itself. But in my family, I am their proof that you can succeed despite the disorder and I hope that with medications and support my child will be too. Idk, I feel like I'm not explaining it right. You don't have to decide today. You're young. It's taken me a decade to decide I want children. I used to hate the idea of passing it on, I still do, but it's worth the risk to me. Like I said, even if they get the gene, it may not even present itself. We, unfortunately, are the lucky ones who it decided to present itself in."
BipolarReddit,fnjkkuf,t3_g24qd6,1587000923.0,Married for 6 months but have been with him for over 7 years before that. We are happy and supportive of eachother and haven't wanted to kill eachother during the stay at home order and him working from home.
BipolarReddit,fneqjup,t3_g1amtj,1586894067.0,It would be amazing to have people to talk to. I've tried to talk to my friends but they just don't understand most of the time or don't care.
socialwork,fnepice,t3_g1ac7p,1586893543.0,That's awesome. I'm still trying to figure out how to apply for the LMSW exam. I have two more weeks of classes. Good luck! I'm really happy for you! You're hard work paid off.
BipolarReddit,fne621x,t3_g0v169,1586883692.0,"Talk to your professors. 2 of mine ended classes early and cancelled final assignments and my last changed my final group project to a discussion board. I think most are listening right now. Even if they don't adjust the classes they may be willing to help you personally. I'm in my last semester of grad school and throughout my college experience I've learned most professors want to see you succeed.

 I started noticing signs of a depressive episode coming my way (increased therapy sessions and meds were adjusted which eased me out) but I'm still feeling blank and have a lack of motivation most days. If you're able, do a telehealth visit with your doctor's. It's nice to have someone to talk to who understands what you're going through. 

Just some ideas that are helping me through this (I created this from talking to other people and finding out what they do to keep busy and motivated. I know it's hard when you're depressed. This is why number 1 is the first thing I did) this is in no way meant to be medical advice. I'm a social worker but I'm not a medical professional.:

Make a schedule and try to schedule some mindless activities like cleaning. Include time for school work even if it's just 30 minutes here and there.

Eat healthy.

Engage in something creative (I'm doing lettering)

Stick to a proper sleep routine

Take naps if you become worn out.

Exercise. I started doing yoga from YouTube videos.
Get some sunshine.

Call a friend or family member instead of text (I don't know your relationships so maybe talk to your therapist to find out if this is good for you. I know there are some people that I can't talk to that are off my list)


If I come up with more I can always come back and post. I have a foggy brain sometimes from my meds."
ac_newhorizons,fmxmsa7,t3_fxwutt,1586467917.0,This is amazing!
BipolarReddit,fmt095f,t3_fx4b6i,1586364787.0,Congratulations! I have bipolar 1. About to graduate with my masters and looking to further my education. This gives me hope that I can do it! So happy for you!
BipolarReddit,fm6vu80,t1_fm6ngu3,1585804736.0,"From what I'm learning in school, self harm behaviors also go along with borderline personality disorder but I used to cut myself from 5th grade until I was about 22 and I was diagnosed with Bipolar I around 22.. Prior to that I was misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder. They can have similar presentations but are also very different. (Graduate level social work student who has been studying mental health for two years). I'd speak to your doctor and list out all your concerns but be very careful about doing too much research because it is hard to not self diagnose. Also try to avoid confirmation bias when you can. Good luck on getting the answers you need!"
BipolarReddit,fm6qxah,t3_ftb1um,1585800769.0,Congratulations!!! I understand the struggle and I am so happy for you and proud of you for not letting it stop you from achieving your goals!
socialwork,fm2yopy,t1_fm2yeim,1585708553.0,"I don't know your school, but from my experience, those meetings are usually beneficial and supportive. I hope all goes well for you!"
socialwork,fm2wdb9,t1_fm2utj9,1585706956.0,Yea mine was over 500 hours so I'm happy they reduced. But I totally understand. I have all the time in the world but my mind is racing and I can't focus long enough to get anything done. It's to the point where I can't get out of bed in the morning because I'm up all night with anxiety about the next day. You're not alone!
socialwork,fm2tk1m,t3_fppiwt,1585705104.0,"I'm in the same boat with graduation and field getting terminated a month and a half before it was due to end but my school reduced the hours they required and provided us a list of assignments we can complete at home for our competencies. My supervisor and I have would have had go decide how many hours it would take to complete the activities and make it add up to the hours needed. Thankfully I was already ahead on my hours so I'm done, but my learning plan isn't."
socialwork,fm2sv1p,t3_fsjsz7,1585704637.0,"It really has been long, with blow after blow. On a bright note, I passed my comps this month! So I'll graduate with my MSW this semester!"
BipolarReddit,flnxhhp,t3_fpy8xv,1585327738.0,"Social Work major here. It took me 5 years to get my undergrad and I'm hopefully going to graduate with my masters this May (struggling to focus in one class). One semester in undergraduate I had to medically withdraw because of the disorder. I did get a few Ds and Fs in there. The best advice I can give is to keep seeing your doctor and go to therapy. The therapist should help you work through daily struggles and the psychiatrist or nurse practitioner should help you get stable on your medications. It took 6 years for me to get stable on my meds. It doesn't happen overnight. I'm on 4 different medications and we are hanging on the edge of a 5th. Others have more, some have less. I struggled in my classes with and without meds. I have to be open with my professors and tell them when I am struggling. I have even told some of them about the disorder and my medication change and have been given extensions or extra assignments to keep my grades up. It also depends on your own determination. You and I may be different. I was determined to prove people wrong, that some people with bipolar disorder could lead a successful life too with the proper treatment. I was determined to be proud of myself. For me, I needed meaning to keep going because some days would have been easy to just give up. Also, look for support. If you have people who know about your disorder, seek out their support too. That can help you move forward if you need someone else to talk to. Oh and to put it into context I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 with rapid cycling. Don't let the disorder define you. You'll make it through this. We are proof it's possible. Now you just need to hold onto the determination within yourself. <3"
starbucks,flhnwaq,t1_flhmyvn,1585166203.0,Thank you! I felt so bad. I don't want to be encouraging the company to stay open. I'm happy they are giving the 30 days now and I know partners at my store took advantage of it. I hope everyone including those stay safe as well.and take care of their mental health during this time as isolation can be really hard and everything going on can cause a lot of stress.
starbucks,flhi2hj,t3_foqskg,1585163062.0,"Partner here, I feel guilty, I went by my store last week and ordered an iced caramel macchiato before therapy. I was about to have a break down and needed to see my Starbucks family. I was worried I'd promote keeping the store open but I just needed them. My store ended up closing anyways but yea... Sorry to every other store for being that person! I haven't gone to another store since and won't be going to one until this is all over!"
AskReddit,fl15sbh,t3_flt20t,1584722550.0,A really great internship at an amazing hospital/termination with my clients at that internship. My school decided to suspend internships for the rest of the semester due to the virus.
BipolarReddit,fkuioga,t3_fkrsyd,1584550137.0,"BP 1 here. I take 60 mg and have been taking for about a year now. For me it has made a world of difference in my moods. I take it at night  which sucks because you have to each with it. I get so sick when I don't. But other than that, grateful for this medication."
funny,fkr9gkr,t1_fkr52c3,1584464420.0,If it does just have your classmates email the chancellor to reschedule. That's what my school is doing. Ours was cancelled as of yesterday. Working on Master's and being told I can't participate in a commencement or the hooding ceremony sucked. We are not going quietly.

pics,fkp9dbm,t3_fjtsmh,1584404769.0,I received an email today that my commencement ceremony in May was cancelled due to the virus. I know how upsetting it is. I spent two years in grad school and I won't be able to be recognized for it. At least she is getting her degree and got to wear her hood! Congratulations!
BipolarReddit,fkd5mhp,t3_fhrxvu,1584068977.0,"If anyone does have any, I'm interested too."
BipolarReddit,fkcl63u,t1_fkcl0iw,1584055438.0,"Right now, this is exactly how I feel. Why doesn't my doctor understand how happy this makes me? Like what's wrong with being happy???"
BipolarReddit,fkcd4ky,t1_fkccp71,1584050569.0,I was always getting sick since being put on meds. I'm on lamictal. I'd ask the pharmacist.
BipolarReddit,fkc37x6,t1_fkc1504,1584044912.0,"I do dread the crash. I never notice anything else until my husband points it out. Then it's a big fight because I get so irritated with him. That's one of the downsides. But there is so much I enjoy. I feel like the world is mine right now and honestly, I don't want that to end."
BipolarReddit,fkc2y2y,t1_fkc2gz0,1584044760.0,I'm 28. I go to the gym now but I still enjoy the extra energy. I'm able to get so much done that gets neglected otherwise.
BipolarReddit,fk1e7bt,t1_fk1d45a,1583777859.0,I didn't even know there was a generic out there. I've been waiting for one. I can hardly afford it and now that I don't have insurance I can't wait to see the cost. It's honestly been a lifesaver and I wouldn't be able to function without it.
BipolarReddit,fjoila0,t1_fjog7bc,1583528474.0,I'm sure we will figure it out together. For now look for community resources to make sure you're taken care of.
BipolarReddit,fjo7m0d,t3_fe5sqh,1583522177.0,"I lost my insurance on the 1st, but Cobra is $1500 a month and we just can't afford that. So not the same but I can relate. I can only imagine what you're going through. I'm panicking over the costs while you've had to lose your team. I hear you. Look around for clinics with sliding scales. I don't know what meds you're on but there are co-pays cards and some reduced rate pharmacies out there too. It's not going to be an easy start but you can figure this out. And I can't speak for everyone, but I know that there are those of us on here that will be here for you along the way."
BipolarReddit,fj120o1,t3_faxptx,1582911622.0,My doctor taught me this a while back and it put so much fear into me I've been taking my meds ever since and making sure I make every appointment and give her all the details. I will deal with the side effects of it gives me more years with my husband and hopefully future children.
starbucks,fiyupcy,t3_fafwg4,1582847373.0,Guess I'm driving to Alabama.
BipolarReddit,fiyunnq,t3_faikqf,1582847342.0,Yes. Sometimes I cry at night taking them. I hate it.
BipolarReddit,fegh5gy,t1_fefq8lr,1579092600.0,It is very expensive but it's one of the first meds that's kept me stable so it's worth the cost and the nausea I get when I don't get enough food or don't eat within a certain window of taking it. But it sounds like in your case it works better for you to be off so I'm happy you're able to be off of it. I've got plenty of meds I'm happy to be off of myself.
