i'm trying so hard to get courage to tell them but i just feel like i can't do it to them. i just don't want to anyone to be worried about me."
mentalhealth,f3na63g,t3_dbias0,1570996341.0,all the fucking time. i know i'm depressed but i feel like im not depressed enough to get help. i feel like there's people who need the help more than i do and that's why i keep it all to myself.
