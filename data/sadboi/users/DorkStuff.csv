1a. Identify favorite type of Hershey kisses and purchase bag. So many choices! 

2b. Purchase custom sticker set on etsy or justcandy

3c. Go buy one of the obnoxious cheap large candy bags for valentines. Leave candy, cut slit, insert small card. 

Card should have a small jab at valentines day and how your way more important than to just off the shelf candy! 

4d. Since we're on a budget and it's just candy, place it in the cheapest gift bag or just wrap.
