There isn't anything else that would increase your chances of getting a god charm... Keep melding and doing charm farms.

Good thing I enjoy doing charm farms. Farming for rares is a slog most of the time but charm farming doesn't feel that way at all for me."

Leaving the nest one day and maybe having a family of my own. Definite no to that now. Was often reminded of that from the conversations between family members. Didn't want any of it. I didn't want those huge changes. I had counselling back then too for the nightmares I kept getting. Never wanted to go through any of this. The expectations, the LifeScript... nah. Seemed terrifying at the time.

I think twelve or thirteen... I started thinking more about the implications of procreating... I discovered a few interesting things and read more about... misanthropy, VHEMT and nihilism. I distinctly remember sharing these views with someone I knew at school and yeah... that someone said I was mental and that I think about disturbing things. Avoided me after that.

Didn't really have anyone in person to share this with for a long time... so these discussions would only really happen online.

Few years ago... started spending more time on Reddit, mostly on banned suicide subs... That was when I came across the term 'antinatalism'. Didn't post here much... was just lurking. I still do that most of the time.

That's how I 'figured' it out. Had these views all along, just didn't know the term 'antinatalism'.

Likewise. Not a very exciting story from me."

When I'm having a really bad day and around others, I'm usually able to keep myself in check... to avoid drawing attention to my mental state, being plagued with all sorts of unpleasant thoughts, sometimes feeling physically sick from it all... and try to slip away quietly if it gets too overwhelming.
