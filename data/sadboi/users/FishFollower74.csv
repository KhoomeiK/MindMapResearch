theology,fqzaqmk,t1_fqygzr9,1589763439.0,"That's not the definitive statement on the Apostles. In context, this passage talks about the 11 apostles remaining after Jesus' ascension and Judas' suicide. They picked another apostle to round out the group of 12. But both Paul and Barnabas are referred to later in Scripture as apostles (Acts 14:14).

The word ""apostle"" comes from the Greek *apóstolos,* which means emissary or ""one who is sent out."" It can also be translated as ""ambassador"" or ""envoy"" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle)). 

In a narrow sense, ""apostle"" refers to those who were the followers of Jesus later sent out on mission to evangelize to the (then) known world. There are some church traditions (Orthodox, IIRC) who accept the idea that there were as many as 72 apostles - with the narrow meaning applied.

More broadly, an apostle is one who is ""sent forth"" to proclaim the Good News - as an emissary or envoy of Christ."

OpenChristian,fnjmnxq,t3_g2558j,1587002201.0,"There are two big things from John’s gospel that are top of mind for me when it comes to Jesus’ claims of divinity. One is John 8:58 where He says “...before Moses was, I AM.” The original Greek phrase in this passage is in the present continuous tense, and has the meaning of “I have always been.” It is also a Greek translation of the Hebrew words God uses when He says “I AM WHO I AM” (Exodus 3:14). The second thing that came to mind is when Jesus said “I and the Father are one.” (John 10:30). 

 Now, as to the Synaptic Gospels, a few things:

- Jesus was called Emmanuel: God with us (Matthew 9)
- He showed He had the power to forgive sin (Matthew 8:3)
- He claimed Lordship over the Sabbath (Matthew 12:8)
- He said that He would be with His disciples “...until the end of the age,” claiming eternal omnipresence (Matthew 28:20)

This is by no means exhaustive, but it shows me that based on Jesus’ own action and words as well as what others said of Him in His presence, indicates that Jesus did indeed claim to be God."

So, there are no quick, complete answers to your questions but I'll give you an overview. I think the biggest mindset change is going from ""I have to convince everyone in my company that Customer Success is really an important thing"" when I started doing it 12 years ago, to now saying ""Trust me, we're following best practices and our KPIs and results are well aligned with other companies our size/in our space."" It's been refreshing and rewarding to see executives embrace the value of CS as a team, and then to see it become a company philosophy in some of the more forward-thinking companies.

How did I get into an executive role - long story, but it boils down to a few things: having big visions and thinking about what I call ""the art of the possible,"" clearly articulating those visions to the C-suite, lining up KPIs and metrics to ensure the goals are met, and then just getting sh*t done. I have a very low tolerance for lack of execution or for people who aren't aligned with the strategy. Doesn't make them bad workers, it just means that they'd be better off in a different spot or different company.

If you have questions that are more specific to your situation, I'd be happy to chat. DM me with your LinkedIn profile (I like to check people out first), I'll connect and we can talk more if needed."

OpenChristian,fmf2s9i,t3_fuutzj,1586018784.0,"/u/Xheiron makes a great point that only the Jewish Scriptures had been codified or agreed to at the time Timothy wrote his letter. It's a bit of a stretch to say that Timothy's words apply to what we now know as the New Testament. Doesn't mean that God wasn't involved in the creation of the NT (more on that in a second), but there's no way Timothy could have known the full scope of Scripture as we know it.

Second point I'd make - some translations say ""God breathed,"" which implies that God spoke the words and the authors just wrote them down (this is what I believed growing up, until I did my own deconstruction). If you dig into the original meaning of the word used here ([link to Strong's Concordance from Blue Letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G2315&t=KJV)) you can see that a better translation is ""inspired by God."" My view now is that through prayer, meditation and the work of the Holy Spirit the writers of Scripture were inspired to share their ideas with various home churches via a series of letters. So my view now isn't that God tapped Timothy on the shoulder and said ""Hey...PSST...write down 'all Scripture is God-breathed...'"". It means that Timothy came to that view by the power and influence of the Spirit."

legaladviceofftopic,fltesi1,t1_flsqq2s,1585469771.0,"OK thanks. So even if this person goes to different pharmacies all the pharmacists can see this record, right? And does this apply to VA hospitals/military base pharmacies too?"
OpenChristian,flrdxet,t3_fqd6ye,1585418238.0,"AMEN!!!

This thought has been of great comfort to me, but I couldn't remember the verse it came from. Now I know it, and I'll memorize it by heart. Thank you!"
chicago,flqey85,t1_flpsv1b,1585391910.0,"Oh wow, thank you - that's very encouraging to me personally. I latched onto as much data as I could early on...but I haven't been as diligent the past week or so, and so I was going off apparently old stuff."
chicago,flpp5s3,t1_flpbnc9,1585365032.0,"So if we’re talking 0.5%-1.0% mortality rate, that’s considerably lower than the 4% rate that I’d seen originally. That’s great news, relatively speaking. Is this just the rate for the US or globally?

Also - do you know if here’s a chart/website like the one OP posted, but that has data globally and not just US/individual states?"

space,flo0jlm,t3_fpv4bz,1585329381.0,So the ELI5 answer is “it most likely was silent.” A physicist made a joke years ago that the Big Bang was neither big (it was infinitesimally small) nor a bang (because there was no medium to transmit sound waves).
Anxiety,flo07qp,t1_flnxomu,1585329205.0,Oh cool I’ll try those! And yeah you make a good point that I should have asked my doc first. Honestly I didn’t even think of that and I should have. 🤦
loseit,flmwzjp,t3_fporop,1585300216.0,"You didn’t fail...you just made poor food choices. But you were a great friend to someone grieving the loss of a dear pet. Today is a new day, just get back in the saddle and get back to good habits. 

You got this!"
loseit,flmwa7y,t3_fpraxp,1585299353.0,"I’ve experienced this myself...when I stop tracking food, my weight starts to creep up. I’m doing Jenny Craig right now which really helps me keep the calories under control, yet I still log everything (food, weight, exercise and water) in a tracking app. It’s a good habit I’m going to keep even when I get to goal weight."
