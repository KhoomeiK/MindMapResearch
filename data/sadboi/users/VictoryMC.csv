regina,fd9s6e0,t3_ek7lol,1578237377.0,"About a year ago I had massive insomnia from working a prolonged grave yard shift. Which lead me to do ALOT of investigation on sleep( I mean I had so much more time to kill only sleeping one to two hours a day )

What I found out is that driving while exhausted is just as dangerous as driving intoxicated. When you reach a certain level of exhaustion your brain actually takes micro naps ( where eyes are open but it just shuts down for a few seconds). Ever not remember doing something when you’re really tired ???

The fact is he fell asleep. He could have let his foot off the break and rolled into the crossing. He could have fallen asleep at the wheel if he was that tired. And no driving with the window down or the music loud isn’t going to stop it. If you’re tired enough your brain will just shut it down. 

The officer actually could have given him a DUI as he was unfit to operate a vehicle and studies prove that driving tired is as bad as intoxicated. So I think the fact he got a slap on the wrists and a fine isn’t anything to be mad at. Would I be upset if it was me ? For sure. 

But you know what I would be more upset with ?  If I put my life or someone else’s life in danger while I was behind the wheel."

However,  your job is not easy. And clearly you are proud of it. And that’s what matters most. 

As for success.  That is measured by everyone in different ways. And I believe that your giving your time, attention , and love shows you are very successful. Very few people could do what you do. And that is something to be proud of. 

You seem like a wonderful caring giving person. A trait that really is lost nowadays. Lost in the stuff and the things and the pictures that show “ success”. And that you should be beaming with pride. Because you are one of very few that help make others lives better day in and day out. 

Kudos to you."

personalfinance,f0p3rdo,t1_f0oaqd4,1568826534.0,"This is assuming you get to keep the same interest rate for the length of the mortgage. Where I’m from most you can lock an interest rate in is 5 years. So let’s say the housing market slows down or worse crashes. Now when you go to lock in the interest rate again maybe instead of 3% it’s not 6%.

So if it does increase you’re paying more to interest than the principal. So if this happens you essentially get a double increase. And increase in payment due to higher interest. And then an increase in the principal payment due to now paying less to it with the new interest rate. ( I find this the easiest way to look at it ). 

So because you are locked into a contract to say pay the mortgage off on 25 years. To stay on track with that obligation both interest and principal payments must increase. 

So that may mean it’s not as drastic as renting. However, you are responsible for everything. Roof leaks, furnace quits , etc. It’s on you to take care of and fix that being a home owner. So it’s kind of trading one for the other IMO. Owning a home is more secure for sure. But is it more cost effective? Depends on the house and the market etc. But I have never met anyone that hasn’t had to do something to their house over the time they’re in it no matter how big or small it may be. 

 My two cents"
Metalsmithing,f05l3vz,t3_d3ruyq,1568412549.0,"You could look into a poor mans set up where you buy some round bar the diameter you want to bend them and insert that into a drill and have it set on a low speed. Then using some plyers or vice grips wrap the copper piece tightly around the round bar. Then when it’s done take a dremel took with a zip disc and cut them apart. If you want them joined together solid after you could solder them and buff out the seam. 

This is just all off the top of my head mind you but i have seen people make their own earnings and such with a similar method out of stainless steel

My only hesitation is if the copper is 1/4 “ thick it might be tricky to bend and may require heat. However copper is pretty soft as far as metals go so may not be an issue to bend it cold. 

Hope this helps"

Even half a page a day to start. I do it daily now. About good days and bad. It’s a good way to recall things in your sessions. Use another colour pen or highlighter as you write to mark off things you want to talk about. It seriously makes a world of difference.

I’m lucky enough to have kids that keep me motivated to keep pushing on no matter how bad the day is. But I struggle hard with doing things I used to enjoy. Like boxing. I just get overwhelmed and freeze and nothing gets accomplished. 

Just everyday. Do the little things. Just something so small. Like drink some water. Or read a book. Even for five minutes. Even if you don’t want too. 

My psychologist had a good idea today. Make a bunch of small things to do and put them in a jar by the bed. When you wake up. Get up and pick something out. And at some point in that day. Do that thing. No matter what.

martialarts,et8adlw,t3_cabdjz,1562550983.0,"My advice is to try all types that interest you. Find one you enjoy and go with it. Check the lineage make sure the place is legit. 

If you can find a legit Krav Maga school try that out. I found it fun and you so learn a little of everything. And it’s self defence specific but also my coach was very realistic. Ie: “ I’m gonna show you a few ways to get out of mount position. But if a street scenario I’d there is a big brick or rock there. Use that. It will be more effective “

But just try out everything go with what’s fun. And the atmosphere of the gym. Those are the things that will keep you coming back and learn quicker

Wear and tear is going to be in anything like this so you recovery for everything is going to be on you. So before and after classes. That’s on you. 

Hope this helps. Sorry for the mobile post"
martialarts,erzrkny,t3_c52qky,1561447785.0,"If you’re looking for self defence I would agree with the previous posts of learning some striking and BJJ. Also I would look into perhaps Krav Maga. It’s a form of Israel self defence that even their army uses. Look for a school that registered with the federation. It’s a really cool and fun way to get in shape and learn self defence. It’s where my martial arts journey started. And I wouldn’t change it for the world. 

That being said. No matter what you learn. Nothing is going to be perfect.  The thing I liked about Krav was it was taught very practical ie: hey I’m gonna teach you a mount escape but if there is a brick there hit them with that. 

My cardio was never better. You learn everything from basic striking and ground to how to try and defend against knives , bats, guns , multiple stackers. Stress drills are designed to simulate real situations ( as much as possible of course. ). We even trained with shock knives, or goggles that impaired vision, or in the dark. Very cool IMO."
