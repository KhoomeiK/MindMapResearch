Do you think it is harmful for people to take them as a primary source because of their bias? Do you think because of their jokes that it's hard to get a proper point across in a serious matter such as coronavirus.
If you watch John Olivers videos on coronavirus I find it hard to take it seriously because all his jokes seem to be directed at Trump.
Make no mistake I'm not a trump supporter but it seems to me like he is drilling anti Trump ""propaganda"" behind the disguise of reporting news"

also , he was very active in my community , whenever there were floods there he was always around helping and when the flooding stopped he got us walls to help prevent flooding.

My suggestion would be to vote person not party. If someone in your area has done a lot for it vote for them. If they haven't then see what other candidates are around , see if they've been elected before, if they have see what they've done for your area, if they haven't maybe consider giving them a shot.

I understand that people are not happy with the current political climate but if we don't act mature we'll just worsen the problem"
