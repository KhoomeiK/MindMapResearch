dating_advice,fq0et1z,t3_g0hz4t,1589030825.0,"Hey there I'm from Sydney in Australia and I'm a 29 year old female whose been single for five years,with occasional two month relationships in that time. I also have a similar history with dating going on endless dates and finding it hard to get a second so your not alone. I have been using the time to get back into my hobbies and having a break from dating. It's working wonders for my self esteem. If you want to msg me feel free :)"
DysmorphicDisorder,fprkr8l,t3_gel069,1588856524.0,"Yes this is exactly the same for me I was speaking about this with a therapist as the extra time started to make me spend hrs on my hair when I already have ocd with it. It's always been an issue with partners as I can't even go to the shops without restyling it till I'm happy, I also break down in tears sometimes as I feel exhausted. What's helped me is wearing a hat, although I wouldn't recommend this always as you don't want to be overwhelmed when you can't wear it to work or avoid. Also giving yourself a time limit even if your not too happy with it just say this will have to do then distract yourself with something else. Also work out one good style and stay with it."
ForeverAloneWomen,fpg8rye,t1_fpenny6,1588597314.0,Can I ask how old you are

BPD,fnonwzj,t1_fnonqr1,1587129931.0,No not pathetic I still think about relationships from five years ago. When I could keep one lol. It's good we all have the support of each other.
BPD,fnon99o,t1_fnomxuv,1587129505.0,"Yes I would I pretty much tried most hinge, okcupid, lot, bumble and tinder. I mean it's been a couple of months and I have done well not going on them. Now I'm feeling tempted and it wasn't healthy."
BPD,fnolus1,t1_fnojyb2,1587128551.0,"Thanks for your reply, yes I feel that too. Did your breakup happen just before this all started too?"
BPD,fnojqz1,t1_fnoilzy,1587127007.0,"Yes, I had an addiction with online dating for 5 years so this is the time I'm having off it but I'm starting to feel tempted to go on it again."
BPD,fnojoa6,t1_fnoi6nx,1587126950.0,Yes I have been good up until last couple of days. Then going through messages with guys from the past realising I should have given it a chance lol
dating,fnnb5y2,t1_fnnaxp3,1587088408.0,"Hey there, thanks for your response :) This is what I'm doing too working on myself and trying to learn new things seems the most productive :)
Can I ask how long has this happened for?"
ForeverAloneWomen,fnmvaiz,t1_fnmuwj6,1587078841.0,"Ah ok I see and understand. I think though even though most would be there whole lives single there will be ones who vary from this slightly and we all have valid experiences. 
Will keep this in mind next time for posting but I have felt very distraught laterly and should be able to reach out for support and conversation with other woman."
ForeverAloneWomen,fnmumw0,t1_fnmuide,1587078480.0,That's fair enough. What do you mean by framing? I definately feel forever alone so thought this is still a suitable forum
ForeverAloneWomen,fnmu4eq,t1_fnmtodq,1587078199.0,Hi thanks for your response appreciate the honesty. I still think my post is valid because yes I have had an occasional experience but for the most part have been alone and struggle mentally leading me to think I will be alone. We can still have a forever alone mentality with occasional experiences.
BPD,fnmnck0,t1_fnldnyf,1587074557.0,"I'm in the same situation and I also get commented on looks a bit, that I'm an attractive girl. Please don't listen to this theory as he hasn't met you and there is more to everyone than looks. Its possibly just bad luck or lack of chemistry. I sent you a private message did you get it? Would be great to talk"
cats,fnkslrj,t3_g2ae96,1587038757.0,Beautiful! :) :)
lonely,fnkmpin,t3_g26r51,1587032970.0,"I understand I feel like that at the moment too. Just know you are not alone, you can message me if you like. It will come in waves but it's good you are expressing it."
BPD,fniu4pp,t1_fnhn8ar,1586986400.0,I'm not sure how this is something that can be a definite as everyone is different haha. There are lots of different types in relationships. Whose to say the guys weren't at the same attractiveness? Maybe I misunderstood your post. And to the OP please dont let this question your attractiveness. This isn't a healthy or true way to view yourself. It's black and white thinking when there are shades of grey.
BPD,fnh0xvd,t1_fnfzsxe,1586951779.0,"Interesting point, I think going for bigger themes etc is a great Idea as you get to focus on other areas of your life and builds your self confidence up :)  I'm currently doing this. I don't know about the overlooking physical flaws on first dates though and guys thinking they are settling for average though. Not sure if I misunderstood that part? I don't think that can be said without knowing all details, sometimes it's not looks other aspects that come into play including the chemistry two people have together."
BPD,fngfte2,t1_fnfm91b,1586930893.0,"Hey there, thanks for your reply :) 
Yes I understand I feel the same I feel I'm much better with moods and my general health when I'm not in relationships. It's strange it's something I desire but when I have been in them I don't think I feel much better. But it has always been me the one who gets dumped as I don't seem to manage my mental health with another."
BPD,fnd6o3k,t3_fumblm,1586860839.0,"Hey there, hope you are well :) reading your post it's like I wrote it haha. I'm 29 and been trying for five years with online dating, everything is exactly like my experience except I'm on the having a break part haha as it was causing me too mental distress. I can say having a break does seem to be the most productive and self rewarding option. Feel free to msg it's nice we can both relate."
OCD,fn6obn1,t1_fn6nhvo,1586703987.0,That's right :) I need to start making small changes as I have just been giving into it.
OCD,fn6n4j2,t1_fn6mcqh,1586703243.0,Yes I'm thinking of trying that this week like just minimising a few steps I usually take. I still will style it but maybe dropping it back quiet a bit with a time limit.  I mean it's easier to do this now as I'm not going anywhere but it's when I do or have someone waiting it gets very bad. But your right not giving in to it  I use photos to measure it as well so I might stop that this week.
OCD,fn6m26c,t1_fn6jj6d,1586702572.0,"Hey, thanks for your reply :) yes I'm the same I have to leave about that amount of time in the mornings too. Looking back it added to reasons partners left me or were frustrated as I would need to do my hair even if I was going to the grocery store and would be in tears almost if I felt pressured with time. I think it could be BDD.
Can I ask what has helped you with it?"
OCD,fn6lurw,t1_fn6il9w,1586702440.0,"Hey there, thanks for your reply :) I feel incredibly frustrated/distressed and won't leave the house till it is how I like it even after repeating it many times."
depression,fmsapc9,t3_fp316i,1586351250.0,"Hey there, your post is pretty much what I experienced recently. I had and still do from time to time have regrets with how i was in my short term relationship unfortunately my mental health got in the way and it didn't play out well, my anxiety went through the roof. He didn't want to be friends either and said it stressed him too much. 
I can say though the thing that has been helping me is focusing on healing and time away from romantic relationships. Yes I'm not happy with how i behaved but it was my mental health getting the better or me. If you use the experience to start healing and time for yourself you will feel productive and on a road to recovery. A great time for reading self help books, audio books, journaling to create new ways of expressing, exercising and breathing/coping techniques. Also daily mindfulness practice calm and  mindfulness coach are great apps. This means you have got something positive out of it, doing it for yourself and possibly future relationships (I'm giving myself about a year away from dating).I put doing these things off for the longest time but it really is worth the effort to see healthy changes in yourself and also the interactions with others. Anyways feel free to message me."
BPD,fm5p6f9,t1_fm5mgvy,1585777220.0,"Thank you yes it's been about a month and a half now. I don't think we will ever talk again like my other as where that happened but to be honest even before we got together I was anxious like a night we all went out together and me and him had been communicating daily and flirting well he flirted with another girl in front of me and he knew I was upset and I told him then that night he still decided to sleep with her. I ended up forgiving him and we started dating but I don't think I should have, things weren't great from the start and i knew the feeling wasn't a hundred percent there for me but I still continued things. 
Yes the phone call was kinder me in the moment realising I wasn't attracted to him and voicing it in another way and I panicked. Actually that was the same with the other relationship my attraction wasn't where it needed to be. I think the trigger was our communication as we were going around in circles he needed a logical reason to do something and I couldn't give him one being more emotional. He said my anxiety was bad and I needed to get more help without getting others to do things. I think I genuinely felt realised critized with how i hope with anxiety and I try so hard so it felt heart breaking. He didn't want to talk to me all day kinder like what my other ex used to do, and I felt I had to punish myself. I wouldn't manipulate but yes he was worried about me, I just went into a relapse and my mental health got the best of me. When he broke up with me it felt cold he was just playing on his phone while I was crying.
Sorry long reply! Haha
I do know the next day he was on a dating app after the breakup so I think it may have played more a toll on me mentally the guilt I feel daily"
BPD,fm5knad,t1_fm4y1g4,1585774713.0,"Thanks for your reply, really appreciate it! Yes definately trying to spend time working on myself for healing. That's where I'm at the moment. 
I guess it's still quiet recent for me so it's a touchy subject as he has completely gone out of my life i think the tricky thing was when it happened he went on other days like nothing happened then broke up with me the day after Valentine's after flowers, chocolates etc and nothing had really been communicated during that time. But yeah there is no contact now.
I had done the same thing in a past relationship about five years ago. With the recent one I felt depressed and I wasn't threatening saying I will commit suicide if you leave, I genuinely wanted to be knocked myself out for a few hrs and felt extremely depressedmore as punishment to myself. I wasn't expecting him to come get me or anything I just felt really terrible in what I said regarding anxieties on our phone call and that I didn't want to be around. I definately need to heal in myself but I guess seeing it as manipulation doesn't help for me as I wasn't trying to do that and I wouldn't do that it was more the punishment of myself. Unfortunately there was a trigger there I think it was the way we were trying to sort things out. These two times were the only relationships I had these two experiences I guess it's good I haven't done that in all of them."
cats,flwyezm,t1_flwy3qb,1585569827.0,Thanks for your reply :) yes she does eat ok we haven't seen any difficulties. I just feel the anesthia would cause her too much stress. If she was a younger cat I would go for it but she's not. That's a good idea with the water In the dry food.
cats,flwxtg2,t1_flwxlwa,1585569236.0,"Thanks for replying, the vet was saying as it could lead to a disease. She gets very distressed with these things and feel the after effects of the anesthesia on her would be too much."
HappySingleWomen,flwg9l5,t3_fhla7v,1585549607.0,"I'm 29 and tried online dating for 5 years before that a 2 year relationship.   
I had lots of short term relationships but it did always end up in me getting rejected. I get severe anxiety at times, it becomes too much and they feel stressed so leave/loose feelings. I decided it was time to have a break from all the dating and focus on my mental and physical health, practising mindfulness, reading, listening to audio books and finding comfort with my own company.   
I have my moments but there is something really fulfilling knowing you are looking after yourself and being productive in areas outside a romantic relationship :)"
BPD,fln2qjx,t1_flmqi9v,1585306974.0,"Yes same here, giving me time to work on internal struggles as well without so many external distractions"

BPD,fljnrer,t1_flid3dr,1585220380.0,">Save

Hey there thanks for your response it helped alot :)   
I'm sorry they called you that, really uncalled for. A reflection on others.  
Yes that's right I sent a message and made sure it wasn't accusatory they did say they didn't say it like that but I still thought it was good I sent it as I don't want to keep experiencing it. It really does make a difference how we communicate things I try to start with a positive, explain the issue then end on a positive."
BPD,flc249z,t3_fnx3fq,1585018013.0,Yes
BPD,fl9qbx2,t3_fnalmv,1584966136.0,Yes very true! it makes a big difference the way we look at things :) this is what I'm figuring out after a breakup at the moment as well
BPD,fl9q0rd,t3_fn58pq,1584965855.0,Hey I understand I also feel the same way and find it hard to keep friendships/relationships in general. Feel very lonely at the moment. You can always message me :) we can all support each other.
ForeverAloneWomen,fl5xlot,t3_fj7cq5,1584848387.0,Hey just wanted to say I joined that group yesterday and it's great. I have been single for 5 years as a 29 year old female and can say I have days where I feel really down about it. Seeing there's a community that reinforces there are alot of positive aspects of being single and to not go into a 'what's wrong with me' mindset is great. I think this is the path for moving forward rather than focusing on the pain. Thanks for posting it! :) hope you are well
BPD,fl3o3c2,t3_fmdy2h,1584792597.0,Hey just wanted to say your not alone. I have experienced hearing 'it was too much to handle' in almost every relationship ended by them. You sound very loving and caring with alot to give and someone will really appreciate that! The way I think of it a person who is suited to be will be ok with my sensitivity and that I do get very emotional. In my instance i'm taking time away from dating to spend time with myself as scary as it feels. I need time to heal after attempting to date for years. I'm always here if you want to private message :)
BPD,fl3ktqe,t3_fmcpnm,1584788663.0,That's very kind and a lovely thing to do :) it's great that you can help others and bring a smile to there face!
BPD,fkx2bon,t1_fkx229j,1584616118.0,"Ah yes I understand, I did so many years of it but I would always end up getting rejected so now taking time for myself and focus internally rather than externally. Your always welcome to pm me :)"
BPD,fkx1sfg,t1_fkx0mdt,1584615517.0,"Hey thanks for replying, yes i tend to sabotage them as well. Did you do lots of online dating?"
BPD,fkwnr91,t3_fkq8if,1584598560.0,"Hey there,  
I know how you are feeling. I recently went through the same thing. The amount of guilt I felt ,how I let my anxiety get the best of me and feeling like I ruined the whole thing being told It was too much to handle. The first few weeks it happened maybe even the month I went through so many emotions guilt, anger on my half then anger on his, empowered then depressed you go through it all but I can say now it's really pushing me to do more for my mental health then what I was. Whether that's daily practises of mindfulness, learning new coping mechanisms, journalling or looking into spirituality as long as you learn from these things even if it takes a few goes, you are moving forward and taking something positive away. You have to put yourself first before external influences as hard as it is. I still think about the breakup alot but when you know you are being proactive about it you will feel good and a sense of normalcy will come back. You have alot of support here so feel free to private message me if you like :)"
datingoverthirty,fkqof7q,t3_fjnlxj,1584451739.0,Hey I'm a female in the same situation. Have been single day for a bout five years and had short term relationships in that time but was a serial dater and I would say I had an addiction to the dating apps. Going through so much rejection being the one to be on the receiving end of things constantly ending. So now I'm using the time to focus on myself. It's scary deleting all dating apps but pushes me to focus on other areas like mindfulness. Anyways feel free to private message me sounds like we are on a similar path
BPD,fkq17kw,t3_eurxsm,1584426352.0,"Hey just know you are not alone. I have also been single for a similar amount of time and am very reactive. It may take us a few goes but we will get there. I tried dating for years but I think taking time for ourselves first and then feeling like it's a better time for a romantic relationship. That's how I'm approaching it, taking time to heal and replenish haha. Feel free to private message me."
BPD,fkfp6h9,t1_fkesoec,1584139450.0,Yes sounds pretty similar to me how long were the short term ones mine are usually a month. Feel free to message me I feel the same good to be able to relate. I also get attached and then they dissapear.
BPD,fkedts3,t3_fhy2fc,1584111089.0,"Hey there do you mean you have constantly dated in 7 years? Like lots of first dates etc as I feel the same. I'm a 29 year old female single for five and have constantly dated getting rejected everytime. They like me at the start but then see how intense emotions and anxiety can get then end it with me saying they don't feel it or feel stressed out. 
I understand i constantly msg too even after its ended like I need more answers. Anyway I'm here to pm if you like"
dating_advice,fkaq0w9,t3_dk51tv,1584016513.0,Hey there just wanted to say your not alone. I'm 30 and been single for five years after trying online dating so much during that time and going out. I have just had very short term relationships in that time maybe two months max. I recently got broken up with again so am now looking after myself and my mental health as it's affected me. Your welcome to message me if you like
BPD,fk04ocy,t1_fjrezyi,1583741637.0,"Thanks for replying, yes this is how I feel. They are very much enthusiastic at the start then it changes.. Have you gotten into a bit of a routine with doing things for yourself?"

datingoverthirty,fjud2hp,t1_fju8yur,1583615784.0,Hey thanks for your reply :) thats great you have as it makes a big difference with how you feel within yourself and being fulfilled in many other areas. This is what I'm wanting to achieve as I have used online dating and dating in general as a way to fill in a void. Feels scary to have deleted all my apps and start fresh but I think it's a great time for new experiences and travelling. At the moment I just don't function well in a relationship due to anxiety etc so the time away is beneficial for myself. Your welcome to pm if you like
ForeverAlone,fjn1kga,t1_fjn1hxx,1583494448.0,"Sorry missed that, either really"

BPD,fj66gli,t1_fj61eg6,1583059120.0,Hey I'm sorry to hear that I understand. I guess taking that time out to do things for ourselves can give us fulfillment and having some new experiences. Do you usually do things that make you feel great?
BPD,fj65elw,t1_fj5yb5b,1583057582.0,I understand feel free to private message me by the way we both have this in common. I also overshare and come off as intense.  I think I have ignored red flags too with different people and it's because they are putting in alot of effort or that I can think it will work somehow.
BPD,fj5elyk,t1_fj5e4a6,1583030818.0,Yes that's true do you find your moods are so different everyday?
mentalhealth,fj5ej14,t1_fj5dq4j,1583030762.0,"Yes same here i find it very hard to just be rational and not overly emotional. Even my brother just said to me as a bad joke you should introduce yourself saying you have problems. 
That's what I did in the last one I was too honest, and did something that was self harming after an argument on the phone about him not being able to do something that would help my anxiety (was a bit unreasonable to be fair) everything went down hill from there. Lots of regrets and guilt but just the concern of how will I ever be able to function healthy in one. It's pretty hard when they just cut contact completely."
mentalhealth,fj5czdi,t1_fj5bfqj,1583029738.0,Hey thanks for your reply :) it's good that you are able to step away and use it productively. What kind of things are you doing regarding working on yourself? Yes things got to intense too quickly and he doesn't even reply now lost him as a friend as well. He said it all stressed him out too much
BPD,fj58fg7,t1_fj585kg,1583026678.0,Thanks for your reply :) yes I guess with my latest partner who ended it I was honest about it but it became too much for him as my requests became unreasonable. My anxiety got really bad and felt I ended up self sabotaging. But what else can you do but work on yourself and try differently next time
BPD,fj54z0m,t1_fj4zptb,1583024323.0,"Hi there, yes its tricky hey. I'm just focusing on myself at the moment but I feel scared not knowing if my mental health will ever be good enough for a relationship"
BPD,fj4vc3e,t1_fj4tzvt,1583017757.0,"Hi there, is it something you still want or? I just feel they like me at the start but once they become aware of how I can get really anxious etc they leave"

BPD,fiwqv7l,t3_fa1imx,1582798716.0,"I really relate to this :) as a 29 year old female I have been single for five years (well lots of short term relationships) before that I had a two year relationship that was traumatic emotionally. During this time I had alot of great experiences but also some not so great ones. Just came out of a short term relationship where I wasn't my best self mentally in it and it really affected me felt like I hit rock bottom after he broke up with me the day after Valentine's Day and what I thought was a great night with a card, flowers and chocolates. He completely dropped off and I repeated mistakes from my past. Decided I need to have a period of time even if it's 6 months to work on me without the pressures of dating. Getting fitness, hobbies, mental health and goals my main priorities. Scary to start fresh but we have to look after ourselves and have time to heal sometimes without external influences. If you want to msg me feel free :)"
datingoverthirty,fdv0mo2,t3_emtuxh,1578741794.0,"Hey there, I'm in the same position as well female, 29 in feb and haven't been in a long term relationship for about 5 years now.I have gone through so many stages with this idea, at one point I was constantly using dating apps to find a partner and can now say that I'm getting much more comfortable being by myself. I have been able to achieve alot of personal goals independently and have created new thought patterns. It's definitely been a journey and have good and bad days like everyone but by letting go of that one thing we think we need to achieve happiness we gain so much more joy in other areas of our life.  
I think the path you are on is great!  there is not one path for all of us, some of us have a journey more on self discovery as cliched as it sounds haha."

dating_advice,fbm3mrj,t1_fbiz2bv,1576977520.0,"Yes that's a great idea, even having daily goals can be good :) I'm sure there are alot of people in this situation with travelling. Alot of my friends have said travelling by yourself is something you should try at least once."

dating_advice,fbhxal7,t1_fbgsupm,1576884786.0,Thanks for your response! Yes I think there's a bit of a culture with hookups and casual sex now being more convenient with online dating. That sounds like a great idea with the app.

pretty anxious travelling across by myself. Making next year a year of experiences could be a great goal for me :) I want to start doing some drawing in the holidays too. Hmm probably not the shy type I would say more extravert depending who I'm around heheh"
dating_advice,fbhwcdu,t1_fbgtc27,1576884048.0,"Thanks for your response! Definitely agree with the thought that partners arn't needing to experience happiness, guess I always liked the feeling when I was going out with someone.  
You have done so much in that time which is fantastic! that's the thing i think I have spent 5 years really making it a focus that I feel I have missed out on other experiences and let it affect my mentality. But maybe I can make that a goal for my last year in my 20s to do more travelling, volunteer work and an exercise routine etc :) Definitely we all have our own path. Always happy to pm :)"
