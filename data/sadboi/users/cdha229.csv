I can really relate to you. I'm taking small steps like this too. And the momentum can be really powerful! As my therapist always reminds me, be kind and forgiving to yourself when you don't do as much as you think ""should."" Every small achievement is a big win!!"
mentalhealth,esfrpcs,t3_c7em09,1561933387.0,Way to go!! ðŸ˜Š
mentalhealth,eqt7jd3,t3_bzjklh,1560304351.0,"Thanks for putting this into words. I feel the same way. Eventually out of desperation I started calling behavioral health offices and asking if they offered low income assistance. There were several places that did, so I booked the earliest appointment. There are also alot of online and even texting options for therapy now. I'm so glad I did because when the really shitty waves of depression hit, I now have someone who I can just word vomit to and it somehow keeps me going. 

Hang in there."
