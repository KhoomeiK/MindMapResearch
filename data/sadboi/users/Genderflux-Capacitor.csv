It's your kidney, and you get to choose if you want to donate. Donating a kidney will change your life a lot. It changes the activities you can do. You'd have to be a lot more careful regarding drugs and alcohol because you would have 1 kidney doing everything instead of 2. And I'm sure there are other things I don't know about.

One thing you can do is get tested and let the doctor know you are being pressured. They will tell you that you are not eligible to donate under the circumstances. Then you can tell you family that you just aren't a match. And that solves that particular issue. However, it won't solve the larger issue of your dad's entitlement. I'm not sure if you really want to take that on right now, based on what you are saying.

You also have the right to straight up just say no. If you want to go that route, I would recommend getting some family or close friends on your side to back you up during that conversation.

I had trouble getting the 350 calories I needed to take it with in a healthy way. I couldn't have dairy, so yogurt or cheese were out. Cereal would fill me up without getting me to 350. So I started taking it with snack cakes. Hey, it worked.

BipolarReddit,fo1j2wm,t1_fo1fhbi,1587434381.0,"I wish I had more ideas for you. 

I'm transgender, and that has made it difficult to find a good psychiatrist. The first one referred to me as a ""transsexual"" upon our first meeting and then clutched his pearls when I referred to myself as queer.*

*Side note: Don't know how familiar you are with LGBTQIA etiquette (US, in this particular case). For anyone not familiar, neither transsexual nor queer should be used for anyone UNLESS THEY IDENTIFY THAT WAY. Him referring to me as transsexual was very ignorant. And frankly very strange. People usually default to trans or transgender these days. On the other hand, it is very common for people to refer to themselves as queer these days. I thought it was super strange that he was taken aback by that.

Anyway, this guy scared me, and when my symptoms got worse and worse, I was too afraid to go back to him. This was before I was diagnosed with bipolar. So I went somewhere else. It didn't work out with the next person either, although that one actually did correctly diagnose me.

So now comes the fun part: Dr. Alexis. I LOVED her at first. She actually said that she understood the trans thing and cared about my name and pronouns! I loved Herbst! She understood me! But she was always late. Very late. Sometimes by an hour.

I kept telling her that this wasn't okay because I had to work. She would just get really condescending with me and tell me that I needed to be prepared to wait.

On one of our last appointments, I very politely told her that I really needed her to be on time. She proceeded to deadname me. Repeatedly. Keep in mind, she had never treated me under my deadname. She never knew me by that name. It really felt like her ""punishing"" me for calling her out. She spent most of our 15 minutes lecturing me about HOW DARE I EXPECT HER TO BE ON TIME.

I still remember how horrible it felt to be deadnamed REPEATEDLY and MALICIOUSLY and having to just accept it because she held my prescriptions in her hands."

BipolarReddit,fbnbl0h,t1_fbn7k9i,1576995346.0,"I'll be honest-- those aren't GOOD behaviors, but that doesn't sound like abuse to me. ""I sometimes slip up and call him names but then I apologize"" isn't abuse. Yelling and ""mean things"" can be. But like. Non-bipolar people do this shit, too. But when we do it, everyone jumps immediately to ""abuse."" I'm not excusing your behavior, but I am concerned that your diagnosis means that people are perceiving ""shitty behavior that still falls within the realm of normal relationships"" as abuse. That's not actually my point, but I want to put it out there. Abuse is a matter of degree. Everyone yells and says mean things sometimes. Maybe you are crossing that line. My advice is the same either way.

Here's the thing: if you are abusing him, the answer is not for him to abuse you in return. You have offered to take a break. To allow him time away from you. HE WON'T ACCEPT IT. Instead, he refuses to allow you to leave and threatens to hurt himself. He is threatening self harm. I don't care how he phrases it. ""I will have a breakdown and quit working"" is a form of self harm.

If one of us did this, it would (rightly!) be called abuse. But a spouse can do this to us, and it's okay? NO. NO, IT IS NOT.

Look, I'm just a rando on the internet. Maybe I'm wrong about you and your husband, two people I have literally never met. But I see a ton of red flags. I just about never comment on shit, but I feel like I would be remiss if I didn't say what I see here. I have lived through these fucking hailstorms of red flags, and I'll be damned if I scroll on past without at least shouting a warning."
BipolarReddit,fbn6rwi,t3_edz7yi,1576993483.0,"So what do you do to him that is so awful? 

Cause what I'm seeing is an abusive man using your mental illness to manipulate you.

Been there. Done that. Didn't even get a fucking t-shirt.

""He's under so much pressure because we bipolar people are so awful!"" He is deliberately cutting off the pressure release valve you're trying to open by saying that a break isn't an option. 

What exactly is the difference between ""do everything I say, or I'll have a breakdown"" and ""stay with me, or I'll kill myself""? This is abuse. He is abusing you. If you are really SO AWFUL to him, he can FUCKING LEAVE. There is NO excuse for this abuse."

BipolarReddit,falxu74,t1_falpwdh,1576192327.0,You really do need the 350 calories. I used to take latuda and my doctor hammered that in. SNACK CAKES. MUFFINS. SOOO MANY CALORIES.
BipolarReddit,falxqw0,t1_falpwdh,1576192279.0,"Ooh, this is something I can help with! SNACK CAKES. Calorie dense and small. Try those."
BipolarReddit,fakzkvp,t1_faksz58,1576175788.0,I have another question. Can you give a couple of examples of your bad behavior and his bad behavior? And is all of your bad behavior in the context of an episode?
BipolarReddit,fakzcz1,t1_faksz58,1576175681.0,"If you need to take responsibility for your actions when you're having an episode, he needs to take FULL responsibility for how he behaved in response. Period.

Based on what you're saying, he's out of emotional resources to cope with the stress. But he's mistreating you, and that's not okay.

Is he open to suggestions? Can you recommend he seek support from a trusted friend? Do you have the option to go inpatient to get this mixed state treated? Latuda is clearly not right for you. In a hospital, they can work with you on your meds. That would also give him time to get his head on straight. He needs to decide to either act right or leave. Period.

You need to know that you don't deserve to be treated like shit because you're bipolar. I'm struggling with this right now. It's so hard to defeat the internalized ableism that I am too hard to love and don't deserve good treatment."
BipolarReddit,fakrunc,t1_fakons2,1576172104.0,"I'm sorry, I'm still stuck on the fact that you are justifying his awful treatment of you. Does he justify it too? Has he ever apologized? Or does he keep that implicit threat in his back pocket? ""Behave yourself...you've seen how I can be."""
BipolarReddit,fakr48k,t1_fakons2,1576171760.0,"Yeah...being awful to you because he thought you were an asshole isn't okay. He should have just left. What, did he think he was gonna bully you into being nice?

I don't know the extent of you two being mutually awful to each other, and I don't think it's important at this point. It's possible that you were awful to him to the point of running through all his emotional resources. That sucks. I'm sorry. But it is not okay to threaten to hate you. He needs to leave at the point that he's making that threat.

The only way I see to make this work is for you to see a bipolar informed relationship counselor TOGETHER. Based on your previous comments, he's not willing to do that. He's not willing to find a way to set boundaries to protect himself without bullying you.

Are you going to accept his emotional blackmail and live in fear? That's your choice. But it's no way to live."
BipolarReddit,fakn4d3,t1_fakmvj6,1576169874.0,"One red flag: you detailed your meanness to him, but him being awful to you in the past is a mere footnote in the update.

Is he pushing you to take responsibility for everything wrong in your dynamic? Does he frame all his awful behavior as being a response to your bipolar symptoms and therefore not his fault? Does he make you feel like it's your fault when he's shitty to you?"
BipolarReddit,fakmvj6,t3_e9pphr,1576169758.0,"I'm so sorry.

It's time to nope out of this relationship. Threatening you with hating you is emotional blackmail. There's no way you can be perfect.

At this point, this is abusive behavior. Even if you have been mean to him, this is not okay. He needs to leave instead of being abusive to you. Two wrongs don't make a right.

Look, I've had people pull the same bullshit on me. I'm so so sorry. I know how much it hurts. I know how much it sucks knowing that this disease is taking this from you.

Yeah, accepting responsibility for your behavior is important. But threatening extended isolating and ""hating you"" is not okay. If that's where he is, he needs to just leave.

Personally, I'm guessing that he's been using the fact that you have bipolar to bully you. I'm guessing that this isn't just a case of ""you are mean when you're unstable, so he needs to protect himself."" His behavior is making my spidey sense tingle because this has been done to me. I'd encourage you to talk to a trusted person and do some introspection before you take full responsibility for everything. One thing people like to do to us is bully us and then tell us we deserve poor treatment because of our symptoms. No, bipolar isn't a license to treat people like shit. I'm not saying that it is. But non-bipolar people really like to exploit bad episodes for their own ends. They like to evade responsibility by pinning their own bad behavior on you. ""You made me do it because you're crazy!"" Be wary.

His behavior is so beyond the pale that you need to get out. There is no saving this."

bipolar,fab4w9g,t3_e8du3i,1575917791.0,"I have been on it for...a few years? It was prescribed as an emergency med to interrupt a manic episode, and I used it PRN at first. I eventually started taking 25 mg every night with permission to take another 25 mg pill if I started to feel manic or depressed. About a week at the higher dose would help me out. After awhile, I was put on 50 mg per night. I feel like it has contributed to keeping me generally stable. I did have a bad manic episode recently (check my post history if you're curious), but I feel like no medication regimen will be perfect.

They did have to up my dose when I started experiencing symptoms, but keep in mind that I am on a very low dose. 25 mg is the lowest possible dose.

I would recommend it. I do have trouble sleeping if I don't have it, which is annoying. But other than that, I haven't really seen any side effects. It has definitely helped me a lot."
