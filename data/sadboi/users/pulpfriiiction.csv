infj,ew2gx0j,t1_ew06lpa,1565046411.0,"great post. its refreshing to hear someone else describe how quickly they can change their personality (for lack of better words), as i definitely feel the same and its lead me to feelings of inauthenticity. im learning to analyze it from a less judgmental point of view, and realize it as more of a haphazard skill, than anything else."
infj,ew2gvfy,t3_cm5udj,1565046380.0,"ur definitely not alone on this one. i was the most outgoing child growing up. definitely could call me extroverted, from what my parents told me. i was wildly independent and i would be completely fine with running off on my own and talking to anyone and everyone i could. i had no problems speaking my mind, and i was a bit of the class clown.

around the time of high school (and even a little bit in middle school), this most definitely changed. my default has been considerably quiet and hidden. its very interesting looking back because i now see glimpses of my introverted nature back then, and i see glimpses of my extroverted nature now. im certainly heavily introverted now, but it can certainly change with the environment. pretty drastically, too. i've definitely struggled with feeling unable to identify myself, which eventually leads to me questioning my own authenticity. im trying to realize that i'm not forced to define myself as anything singular, and being multi-faceted isn't fraudulent; it's beautiful."
mentalhealth,ew1td8w,t3_cmefq1,1565031017.0,"wow. i am so so sorry you had to go through that. that must've been so turbulent. the physical side affects sound absolutely horrible, and to top that off with the emotional harm done...? whew. all i can say is you're an incredibly, and i mean *incredibly* strong person. i'm so glad you've come to the point of realizing how deafeningly true your last couple of sentences are.

i must say....... you're remarkably respectful. it's really healing that you don't seem to harbor any ill-will towards him; that would do you more harm that it would to him. you're past this and that's all that matters.

that being said.... **FUCK THAT PSYCHIATRIST**!! holy shit. the physical, emotional, and even financial damage that he caused you is insane. i know nothing, but honestly.... it sounds like you could have a pretty favorable law suit on your hands. again, im not a professional so this is only speculation, but here's a site below i found concerning it.:

[https://www.golombhonik.com/blog/2017/december/can-i-sue-my-psychiatrist-/](https://www.golombhonik.com/blog/2017/december/can-i-sue-my-psychiatrist-/)

if this is possible, it may very well give you extra closure, not to mention compensation for what you went through. please look into it if it sounds like something you would be interested in. also if anyone else who stumbles upon this knows more in regards to legal issues, guidance on this (if its possible) might be really helpful.

regardless, you're a solider. to come out of that with an attitude that you have is exceptional. here's a long overdue congratulations to you."
mentalhealth,ew1n3u9,t3_cm3d5w,1565027021.0,"this is so seldom talked about, thank u for making this post. cannabis can easily become a crutch when you're mentally ill. i definitely went through a time period where at any given point, u could bet i was at least a little bit high.

for me, when im in a depressive episode, there is genuinely nothing inside me except for my depression. what weed did for me was throw a blanket over my mental illness for a little bit. a temporary removal. but the thing is, is that when weed ""took away"" my depression for that hour or two, i became a complete shell of myself. depression was all i had, so when that was gone, i was gone. i felt as though i had two choices; being numb or being depressed. i chose the former everyday for 4 months.

weed can completely blockade you from improving ur mental health because it can entirely mask it. i still smoke very regularly, but it's no longer my crutch by any means. i had to make a conscious decision to regulate how much was beneficial for me, and when it was time to take a break. i had to become responsible enough to not lie myself saying its okay when i knew it wasn't. this whole process has taught me a lot of self awareness, and for that, im really thankful for it. im very lucky to not be prone to psychosis, because i never once took that into consideration at the time and easily could have spiraled even worse than i had. i dodged a bullet with that one.  im really glad you know how you operate with weed, even if it took a whole lot to come to that realization. thanks again for this post, many people don't truly consider this."

infj,evnp3gg,t3_ckbt1m,1564629223.0,"ahh, i love that! im so glad that you've figured this out within yourself, thats so fulfilling. i've adopted the same approach with all STEM things, really.

i think part of my problem is that i like to take my time to **ENTIRELY** understand a concept before i move onto another, so i'm often forced to hurry along the course without getting the chance to thoroughly analyze everything how i would like to. so then i just fall back into monotonous memorization just to stay ahead. i still do pretty well when this happens, but i just personally know that i don't have the full understanding that i know i could have. this is why i've learned that i can teach myself something better than anyone else can. not out of skill, by any means lol, but simply out of the patience and the room i give myself to truly explore an idea.

this kind of reminds me of when i was younger; i would LOVE to play games online that had no instructions whatsoever. ones that just threw you into the games with no idea what the controls were or what the objective was or anything. i feel like this is probably largely related to by a lot of INFJs - we sure do like autonomy over anything we do."
overcoming,evioi3t,t3_ck1358,1564546245.0,"it’s currently lunch time for the students, and the math teacher has about 30 minutes before the kids come back from the cafeteria. he sits at his desk eating his lunch and checking grades when one of his students walk in after only 10 minutes. the teacher waves at him and the student sits in one of the seats and starts studying a bit. this student was sick the other day and didnt come to class, and they happened to take a quiz that day so he came in during lunchtime to make it up.

after about 5 minutes of quickly looking over his notes, the boy walks up to the math teacher and says he’s ready to take the quiz. the math teacher stops eating for a moment and reaches in his drawer to get a copy. before handing the student the copy of the quiz, the math teacher takes a couple seconds to talk to the boy before he takes it. the math teacher says the following:

“in whatever you do, no matter how hard you try, you will fail. you’re weak, indecisive, and slow. you have no redeeming qualities and im shocked you even made it into this class. you will never amount to anything because you know that deep down, at the end of the day, you’re entirely useless. good luck on your quiz.”

that student ended up failing. miserably. he took the test with teary eyes, so much so he could barely read the quiz. all the studying he did was wiped from his memory and replaced with doubt and self-hatred. it took him his very last drop of energy to even circle any answers, let alone try get them right.

he ended up failing every single quiz for the remainder of the year. no matter how much he tried to get back on his feet and study real hard, he failed. not because he was stupid. but because every single time he picked up a pencil, his math teachers voice would start ringing in his ears. it happened so often, he forgot it was even there. but it most definitely was.

dont do this to yourself. you’re worthy and capable. change your language. change how you speak to yourself. it makes all the difference."

UMD,evh6hq0,t1_evgthsb,1564521581.0,"oh, nice. im in a very similar situation, actually. i did the 8 sessions and i loved my therapist. he was a really good introduction into therapy for me. i think the fact that i knew it was only 8 sessions made me hold back a lot though.

yeah, i think umd could do a lot better. its not like the university doesn't know we're a huge body of students. they should accommodate accordingly. but i suppose the root of that is trying to make mental health more of a priority. opposed to football lol. im definitely going to do group therapy this fall. i hope it all goes well for u! and thank u for ur response.

overcoming,ev8ewk0,t3_cilo7x,1564277538.0,"i lost three of my closest friends a couple months ago (and a handful of others), one of whom was my best best best friend. im talking platonic soulmate type level. it was crushing. i felt like i had nothing left. i felt like everything i believed in was put into question. and on top of this, i also had severe mental issues during the same time this happened. but here i am, months later: fine. good, almost. and i feel myself, for the first time in my life, heading on what could be incredible path. in every aspect in my life. im early in the process, but my god, if u told me back when this happened that i would feel this hopeful, i would've laughed in ur face.

so. how to handle it? invest in urself. transfer all the energy that u placed in ur friends into urself. self-care\^2.

this means first, pouring out ur emotions. unfiltered and ugly. journal it all. journal it frequently. force urself to articulate ur sadness, opposed to enabling it to fester enclosed in ur mind.

cry. probably a lot. physical release can be very healing.

then actively and consciously grow. make lists of things you've always wanted to accomplish; emotionally, academically, physically, spiritually if thats ur thing, etc. make specific plans on how you're going to achieve them. mold urself into the best possible version of urself. i see in ur comment that ur going off to college soon. this. is. perfect. really, it is. it may not feel like it, but this is a gorgeous opportunity to transition into ur best self. a fresh start. the timing couldn't be better.

most of all, understand this time is turbulent. it will be really really bad for a while, then it'll be okay, then bad again, then good, then better, then bad again, etc etc. its rough, but by the end of it, you're going to know urself better than you ever have. and you'll come to the realization that significant growth often requires significant loss.

hang in there. it gets pretty alright."
depression,ev894ey,t3_cig81w,1564272729.0,"i definitely have related to this many, many, many times before. its an addicting mindset. but here's an ideology that i've seemed to pretty comfortably settle on. 

&#x200B;

let's say you're right. let's say life is void of any meaning at all. ok. but you're here. i'm here. we never asked to be here and we frankly fucking hate it at times, but we're here. brewing in that ideology is entirely and completely pointless. it accomplishes nothing at all and only perpetuates a self-fulfilling cycle. to me, that sounds like a massive waste of time. so i try to tell myself, whenever i start thinking like that, that there are only two options. i either leave, or i make this shit as good as i possibly can. not condoning suicidal ideation at all (or suicide itself), of course, but this is just how my mind works. i either kill myself, or i fucking TRY. if im going to be here, u better believe im gonna try my best make this shit worth it. if nothing matters, then that sounds like free rein to do whatever the hell i want. might as well fuck around and try to be happy. why would i do anything else."
