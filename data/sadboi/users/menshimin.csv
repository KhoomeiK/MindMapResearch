SuicideWatch,fkvb363,t1_fktua00,1584565634.0,"I’ve been on and off medications since I was five years old. I’ve been in and out of trauma therapy since I was five, seen so many psychiatrists and psychologists, and I’ve only now come to a set of medications that seems to be work as best as it possibly could. For background information, I cannot take SSRIs or SNRIs, due to the fact that every time I’ve taken one, I’ve gotten serotonin syndrome, which was only recently found out last year, and explains a lot why taking certain medicines made me feel like I was going to have a heart attack and made psychosis episodes work. 

I’m currently in Lamotrigine 200mg, Quetiapine 300mg, Clompiramine 50mg, and Alprazolam 2mg as needed. 

I’m sorry that you’ve had to go through something so similar. I’m here for you if you ever need anything. Someone to talk to, to vent to, anything."

starbucks,ez8kc2w,t1_ez8jw9b,1567746316.0,"I’ve had so many wacky symptoms. A swollen lymph node that is literally bulging from neck and bruising my skin, nasty headaches and migraines, sore spine, stiff neck, fluid leaking from my ears, a rash (granted, they gave me toroidal when I was in the hospital the first time, and a shot in urgent care, so the rash might have been from that), dizziness, I can barely see because my eyes get so fuzzy, severe dehydration, and more and more symptoms keep appearing. No one can figure it out, but they’re pretty sure it’s meningitis. 

It’s all been weird, and it’s the busiest season and we’re so understaffed I feel like such a jerk. But I know that I can’t go in to work if I literally can’t move my head or stand without nearly passing out. That would be no good for anyone."
starbucks,ez8jleg,t1_ez8j6j6,1567745552.0,"I was off for five months on a filed and approved medical leave for a completely separate health issue which I FINALLY got figured out and under control, and then this happens. They don’t know if it’s viral or bacterial, or an EXTREMELY rare side effect from one of my medicines, which happens to be non-viral non-bacterial medication induced meningitis. So I’m in the dark here. And I’m terrified. 

Filing for time off, whether it be short term or long term is surprisingly really easy. Sedgwick makes the process really easy. But if you file for disability payment, that is a little more tough, specifically in my state because I have to go through a different disability service. 

Good luck, and I hope you feel better!"

I was taking Zoloft, Luvox, and Trileptal for mood stabilization, and I went off the Trileptal because it messed me up really bad, and stayed on the Zoloft and Luvox and I legitimately thought I was dying. I thought I was having heart attack and I thought I would die if the symptoms kept going on. Hand shaking, muscle spasm, I could barely breathe and had chest pains. It was terrifying, and no one believed me until that nurse. 

I know now I can’t take it, but some doctors refuse to believe it and it’s beyond frustrating. I want to go to the Mayo Clinic at some point (nothing available in my state because it’s a rock in the middle of the ocean) and get properly checked by doctors that know what they’re doing and are thorough and actually seem to care about their patients."
