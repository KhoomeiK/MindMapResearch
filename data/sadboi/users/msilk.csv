depressionregimens,focutat,t3_g6ithg,1587676177.0,"I had all my ketamine infusions similar to the first week of your schedule, except mine were Monday Wednesday Friday for two weeks, 6 total treatments.

You kinda get ‚Äúused‚Äù to the psychedelic effects over the treatment course, which is very normal and even expected. So the dose is upped. 

I read many case reports and studies prior to starting my treatment to get a gauge of what to expect. Some people do once weekly, some twice weekly, and some three weekly doses. It sort of depends on your doctor. I think it‚Äôs good to have 3 doses in your first week to establish efficacy and provide you with rapid antidepressant effects, and then space them out a bit to maintain.

askdrugs,fnma26y,t3_g26vfx,1587067715.0,"I think there‚Äôs some emerging evidence about use of psychedelics and micro-dosing in depressive disorders, but I wouldn‚Äôt immediately draw correlates to bipolar disorder or bipolar depression for exactly the reason you mentioned: mood stability or lack thereof when using a psychedelic. All I‚Äôd say is proceed with caution. 

That being said, I had severe, treatment-resistant bipolar depression and after two back-to-back inpatient hospital stays, partial hospitalizations, and innumerable medication trials over four months I decided to pursue ketamine treatments at a well-respected hospital in my city. I went through 6 infusions, each 40 minutes in length in a low-stimuli room in the hospitals PACU (since technically ketamine is first and foremost an dissociative anesthetic medicine). It worked very fast, within the first day or two, and continued to become more efficacious as my dose was increased and I continued with the remaining treatments. It was definitely trippy.

Now, I‚Äôm now on two meds, have been stable since leaving the ketamine program, and highly recommend it to anyone who is suffering. It‚Äôs expensive, yes. But shop around, because private ketamine clinics typically charge way more than large hospitals who really have nothing to lose or gain by offering up a little ketamine‚Äî my treatments were ~$550 each but I‚Äôve heard of private offices charging upwards of $1k a pop.

Edit: regarding interactions, I don‚Äôt think oxcarbazepine has interactions with the psychedelics you mentioned; they operate mainly on the monoamine system. Ketamine, just FYI, might have some very minimal interaction (making ketamine less effective) because of marginally similar competing interactions. I remember being cautioned during consenting to treatment that anti-epileptics such as benzodiazepines and lamotrigine would make ketamine less effective in treating depression."

nursing,fluauzu,t3_fqydm9,1585498917.0,"Chiming in here just to say that since January, the information we were told as both healthcare workers and members of the general public was so variable and fluid that it was hard to figure out how to respond, and what to think. And this isn‚Äôt information from wackos on Facebook. I‚Äôm talking about information disseminated from people and agencies who were deemed reputable. That was the hardest part for me. There was so much changing so quickly about virulence, ease and rates of transmission, mortality rates, methods of disease control, etc. It honestly felt like every day what I thought I knew about the virus had changed. I want to acknowledge that for many of us, we haven‚Äôt seen a novel pandemic like this in our lifetime. I think we‚Äôve got to admit that because of this, it makes it uniquely hard to adapt to. Precedence is a big predictor of response, and put simply, people don‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt know.

I also want to acknowledge that in the beginning I was very much someone who didn‚Äôt think it would get as bad as it has gotten. I advised friends to stay healthy, practice hardcore hand hygiene, and stay home if they got sick. But I admittedly tried to keep people calm. I didn‚Äôt think the government would react as slowly as they did. 

I will say that I don‚Äôt think this is the time for pointing fingers and causing a divide amongst our group. Right now is a time to band together, to support each other more than ever before, and to continue the fight. When things settle down, I do expect there to be a lot of blame assigned and fingers pointed; I think that‚Äôs the appropriate time for it. And it‚Äôs those moments that we‚Äôre going learn from so that moving forward the same mistakes aren‚Äôt made. It‚Äôll be those moments that hopefully enlighten people and cause permanent shifts in how we view disease and it‚Äôs impact on our healthcare systems. And I look forward to that, because as many in this thread have accurately pointed out, admitting mistakes and learning from them is a predictor of growth and humility. I hope we will be smarter, more informed, and better prepared in the wake of all of this."

I take 50 mg of quetiapine at bedtime for sleep as well. I‚Äôve been as high as 600 mg during really bad mixed episodes and depression but it only seems to temporarily fix things, not hold me steady for long periods of time.

I was rotating between days and nights and I didn‚Äôt want to be on a med-surg floor anyways, but it was fantastic experience a great way to get my foot in the door. 

I ultimately left because I was super depressed and really anxious, not just at work but even on my off days. That wasn‚Äôt healthy. Now I work in the ED. I‚Äôm much happier, I enjoy going to work."
bipolar2,f7751oy,t3_dufirn,1573444176.0,"At 50 mg the sedation was manageable and I had zero appetite issues. I would say once I got above 100 mg on the XR the morning fatigue can be tough.  By 200-300 mg the appetite stuff really kicks in for me. My final resting dose was 400-600 mg XR for mixed depression. I would say it was actually a little more activating than lower doses but the weight gain can be a problem when the dose is that high.

If you run into issues with metabolic effects from Seroquel, Metformin or Topamax are both great options for managing them."
askdrugs,f75q4xc,t1_f75odux,1573417924.0,Kinda clear I provided you with one? So you low-key just came here to have a conversation about sexuality. Cool.
askdrugs,f74lt5o,t3_dubwx0,1573404470.0,"I mean, Adderall technically falls into empathogen‚Äìentactogen class of drugs. So emotional openness and emotional relatedness are going to be likely effects of taking such a drug.

Sexual orientation is innate. Pills aren't going to change it. And if there were to be a pill that could achieve that effect, Adderall ain't it. I mean that in the least antagonistic way. I'm just saying in terms of the complexity of the human condition, specifically human sexuality and orientation, Adderall is small potatoes in comparison. Taste for food and taste for women/men are two different things entirely.

That being said, it sounds like there's some confusion here with sexual attraction/orientation versus sexual arousal. Your sexual attraction is to women. You've established that for us. Being sexually aroused by women is the norm for you, then. But sexual arousal while on a mind altering drug that increases brain concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine might make someone hypersexual, and their sexual arousal patterns off the drug may not be what they experience while taking it. That doesn't mean the drug makes you gay. It really, truly sounds like drug-induced hypersexuality. Which for you presents as a temporary broadening of your sexual interests.

**Edit**: I can't speak to why its just Adderall and not other psychostimulants. Maybe it's related to the ratios of amphetamine isomers in Adderall or maybe it's related to your dose."

IAmA,f70ui23,t1_f6wwax9,1573332704.0,"You are severely misinformed, or perhaps lack common knowledge about the lives of doctors and nurses. We do not, in any capacity, represent **any** interest aside from the health of our patients. So please don't speak on my behalf. No body drops tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars so we can go to rigorous schooling in order to come out and not first and foremost place our patient's well-being in our crosshairs. We work hard, and we work long. Eight, 12, 16 hour shifts. It is safe to do so; it's certainly not a new concept to work a double shift, a long night shift, a holiday shift. Is it constantly fun? No. I often have to apologize to people like you for things that are professionally outside of my control, people who have unrealistic views and expectations of hospitals and the *unionized* Emergency Department I work in. I often have to console parents who's children are extremely sick with a grave prognosis, or walk families through the difficult decision of stopping extraordinary care measures during an active code of a patient who is arresting on the bed in front of us and will not meaningfully recover. But that is my job and I do it well. Because I am ""educated person"" as you seem to struggle to understand, and I also have a heart. I am all I'm cracked up to be. I'm not afraid to do whats in my power to make sure my patient receives the best care they absolutely, possibly can. In order to do all of this, we have to have enough providers (nurses, doctors, NPs, PAs, techs, unit coordinators, environmental staff, child life specialists, social work, psychiatrists, interns, residents, etc.) in order to treat the influxes of patients we see in the Emergency Department that then trickle into the rest of the inpatient floors. We respond to patient demand. Believe me, we consider the system that we are a part of every single day, every single shift. By speaking on behalf of an entire group of people you evidently know nothing about, what you end up doing is piss people off. I caution you to choose how you speak about an entire population of people, who, like I said, care deeply and compassionately about your health. Perhaps consider this ""displeasure and anger"" you're finding in this thread to instead be frustration with misinformed, or otherwise ignorant people trying to tell experts how to run an entire infrastructure from the sidelines."
IAmA,f6z4rqy,t1_f6wyjij,1573308943.0,"This is correct. Boston ER nurse here. Our city has something like 20 hospitals within the confines of the greater city area with 8 being L1 trauma centers, mostly located in the heart of the city. I agree it's far too unique an area to generalize what happens in Boston's healthcare environment to various parts of an entire country. Systematically and fundamentally, as u/not_a_legit_source has said, it's different, and I think thats an important point to make. Drawing parallels just isn't that easy."
cowboyboots,f6ycqh0,t3_dtlds5,1573274883.0,"Very nice, dude."
