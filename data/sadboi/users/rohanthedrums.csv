The thing is, though.. I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt keep living in a world where I don‚Äôt exist or matter to anybody. Where I‚Äôm oblivious and naive and nothing I do has any effect. Where all the things that matter to me matter to no one else.

I‚Äôm very strongly introverted but also very creative and caring. To get a really good idea of what I‚Äôm like, check out Psych2Go on youtube: their video ‚Äú12 Things Introverts Are Best At Doing.‚Äù Anyways, I‚Äôm a really empathetic person but I‚Äôm helpless.

I‚Äôm turning 16 soon and I‚Äôm getting worse at school. Depression and derealization slowly destroy my world and my lack of any love or empathy in my life makes me feel unimportant. When I look in the mirror I‚Äôm disgusted at the creature looking back. I recognize my talents and my great personality but there is some part of me deep down that hates me, and the only way I can overcome that is for someone to show me love.

I can‚Äôt stop searching for love because it‚Äôs the only thing that can save me, if that makes any sense. As a matter of fact, the hope that maybe some miracle will happen and I will have love is one of two reasons I haven‚Äôt killed myself."
