Just a generic vinyl from ebay but it does it with a cardstock as well."
cricut,fpjsl74,t3_gdwdka,1588679807.0,"Hi all! I bought Cricut Explore (not even Air) ages ago and have been using it here and there for some basic shapes but recently I was trying to cut letters and it's doing this - corners and lines are distorted ( you can see it very good in the bottom text) and I can't find the reason why anywhere. Mat is still tacky and holds material well. It cuts all the way through, no problem with that. I have to say that blade is ancient. Could that be the culprit? Text is about 10 mm high so not super tiny. It does the same with svgs and text made in Design space."

TooOldToDieYoung,etxh4mk,t1_etxfe2v,1563299227.0,I recon because it was too abrupt for my liking. But knowing Refn probably everything was for a reason even that last half episode.
TooOldToDieYoung,etwpfwk,t3_cdscm7,1563280188.0,"I was feeling like Refn was edging me for 13 hours without satisfactory result. There was some kind of satisfaction during the series but the ending was rubbish. Although I'm willing to forgive Refn everything because he's the only one who can afford to make such slow paced series and get away with it.

On unrelated note - more people should watch and talk about DARK - German series on Netflix. I think it's amazing."
