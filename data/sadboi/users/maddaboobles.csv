FinalFantasy,fp8n5py,t1_fp7ytk4,1588396863.0,Haha thank you. I haven’t read the Novella but I’ve heard...things
FinalFantasy,fp7mmp0,t1_fp7kx7h,1588373511.0,"I love spira and would love to dive more into the world. If it’s a prequel I’d like to see what events got spira to where it is in x. If it’s a sequel I’d like to see the aftermath and how people are evolving with sin gone. 

That was a big issue for me with x-2 where you see spira after sin but it’s only two years later so there’s not much new to see other than kolkka. Would love to see some advancements and bigger map areas.

I wasn’t a huge fan of the shuyin/lenne story but I think Ted be interesting to see shuyin before he became a hateful spirit. It’d be cool to see how much of tidus’ personality would be paralleled in shuyin. 

That being said I’d still like a story centered around new characters on a new journey in spira 1000 years ago.


That’s interesting though, I didn’t know they wanted to explore dream zanarkand more. I think it’d be a cold idea to see real zanarkand and then go to dream zankarnd after sin destroys the real one. I know that real zanarkand is connected to my gagazet but dream zanarkand is an island near baaj temple. I feel like that’d be a cool thing to explore. 

Also thank you for reading my post! I know it’s a bit long and I appreciate the feed back!"
FinalFantasy,fp7lr2y,t1_fp7ks5b,1588373026.0,"I love that video! Thank you for sharing!

Personally, my favorite character is rikku (I started playing this game when I was 9 and she was always my favorite so she has a special place in my heart haha) but I would hate to see another sequel centered around her. I’m afraid it would be another money grab and would just be, as others have stated, fanfiction. 

If they could come up with a serious and interesting installment centered around her that would be awesome but I’m worried it would be more of the x-2 feel."
FinalFantasy,fp7kdkr,t1_fp7jybi,1588372268.0,"Thank you! That’s my thoughts exactly. Like I said, there are some things I like about x-2 but for the most part it was an easy money grab. I disliked the fighting system and the dresspheres. Wasn’t a huge fan of the new character design and it was way to lighthearted for what I wanted. 

I feel like there’s such a beauty in x to finding the happy moments in a dreary world where x2 was finding the depression in bubble gum. 

I love the world so much that I want to play through your spira again but the characters I know and love have had their stories and they’re perfect as is"

Once again, depends on the building and how much you waste gas and electric. My gas bill is pretty low. I think the highest it’s been is $30 but I also don’t really turn on my heat ever. I don’t know what my average electric is because it’s all over the place. I pay from $95-150 every two months depending on my usage.

It’s possible to get a $1200 a month studio and depending on the area it can be a pretty cool and big studio. Just depends on what you find. 

Now is not the time to move to LA though with the virus and everything."
beverlyhills,fkxza5d,t1_fkwsw4t,1584638329.0,"Depends on what area. Even in a not so great neighborhood hood $1200 is a lot for a studio.  You might have to move to the north valley or Santa Clarita to find something in your price range but I suggest looking into Long Beach. 

Long Beach has great prices and the area is getting better. I love Long Beach but I wasn’t willing to make the commute. 

Current rent for 1 bedrooms is around $2000-$2600.  If you have any other questions about LA feel free to message me!"

I had terrible self esteem, social anxiety, and was constantly put down by myself and others. Now I have a job I’m happy with, great friends, live by the beach, travel, write, paint, create, surf, date.

AskDocs,f8co92n,t1_f8cnv8w,1574464836.0,"Yea it’s most likely due to the fact that you were sick. Get your blood tested again in 3 months and if they’re still high then you should see a specialist. 

Even then it most likely isn’t cancer. Most often it’s due to iron deficiency but if you go to a specialist they’ll get to the bottom of it. 

I’m not a doctor but I’m going through the whole raised platelets things right now and have been for about two years"

DiagnoseMe,f6r7bsr,t1_f6nl3as,1573095558.0,Ok so I got my full CBC back today and the only thing that stuck out was my platelets at 513 and my MPV at 8.9 which I guess was slightly low

DiagnoseMe,f6njpba,t1_f6nj0qm,1572992997.0,I believe that is the step that we’re currently on. I’m just waiting for the most recent results to come back and see if I’m (hopefully) iron deficient. I think I’m just flipping because they sent me to a specialized hematologists in the disney cancer center in Burbank because no one else could figure out why my platelets are rising.
DiagnoseMe,f6nfqls,t1_f6ne40n,1572990592.0,"Everything in my bloodwork came back normal except the platelets. I’ve never had an abnormal result for rbc or wbc and once when I was sick my hemoglobin was weird but that was back in July if 2018. 

I don’t have my latest results online yet but my results from 12/18/18 were:

WBC - 9.20
RBC - 4.47
Hemoglobin - 12.9
Hematocrit - 39.9
Mean corpuscular volume - 88.6
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin - 28.9
MCH concentration - 32.6
Red cell distribution width-SD - 44.3

Platelet count, auto - 463
Mean platelet volume - 9.4
Necleated RBC%, automated - 0.0
Absolute nucleated RBC count - 0.0

I normally don’t worry about medical stuff. Even the high blood pressure I’m always told is anxiety. I’m active and in really good shape so I always assumed I was pretty healthy. Every time I get sick everyone yells at me to go to the doctor but I don’t usually go because I’m always told I’m fine or I just need to ride whatever it is out. This was the first time a doctor has told me that I may have something wrong that needs to be diagnosed which is why I’m concerned.

It’s ok to still have feelings for the guy. He took your virginity and that’s a HUGE thing to take. It’s ok to want him to care.

No college as I didn’t want to take out a loan and no one was gonna pay for me so i worked retail for a couple years. Got offered a shitty job for my photoshop skills and 6 months later got offered and amazing job for my photoshop skills.
