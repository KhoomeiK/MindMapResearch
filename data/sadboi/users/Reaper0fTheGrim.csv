dating_advice,ert0owq,t3_c3nyya,1561229250.0,Oh God yes. It's SUCH a relief. I'll more than likely give my number to a woman I'm not attracted to at all if she were gutsy enough to ask for it. Lol
dating_advice,erhux0t,t3_c20o1s,1560883422.0,"Well I definitely needed to hear this today. 

Been thinking about a girl 2 months straight after she ghosted me. I have her so high upon a pedestal at this point, I don't even know if I'd recognize her today."
dating_advice,erceycl,t3_c191g8,1560710352.0,"Honestly? I don't know WHAT makes me fall in love with a person. I can have 10 traits on paper that I like, but catch feelings in 1 hour with a woman that has none of them. To my detriment, I might add.."
dating_advice,er0koyl,t1_er02ph5,1560418355.0,"Totally agree. Problem is that when im in that situation, I'll forgo all self respect and self control. Haven't blown up her phone, but haven't stopped thinking about her in months"
dating_advice,eqx2wjb,t3_bzjrez,1560364518.0,I'm stuck pining over a girl I desperately want after she ghosted me after the 1 date. It's been 2 months and I'm tortured daily.
dating_advice,eqjkxyz,t1_eqjjymc,1560106734.0,Close to it man. I don't know why in the hell I am this way. I was just trying to start dating again and now I'm wishing I wouldn't have even gone that night
dating_advice,eqjbr9l,t1_eqj7eap,1560102240.0,"Freaking exactly, man. You put it precisely how I feel. I tried making the post short so left alot out, but during that month and a half of talking, there may have been 2% that was sexual back and forth. It was 98% of us getting to know each other and being ""pleasantly surprised"" by everything we were hearing. 

And it's got me almost glitched or stuck, because there was never any actual interaction between us face to face that wasn't positive, and had momentum. So for the ground to just disappear underneath me like that.. man"
dating_advice,eqiuz8t,t1_eqirbb1,1560094065.0,"100% accurate about the thoughts being intrusive and obsessive. I haven't found a single thing that has been able to distract me from these thoughts outside of talking to other women. After a few weeks, it started to become clear to me that this isn't a normal level of emotional distress given the circumstances (at least I think). 

I'm really really hoping therapy will help me with this. And I'm almost hoping my therapist will find a diagnoses so I can get on the road to fixing whatever it is making me this way."
dating_advice,eqitu75,t1_eqisq6u,1560093520.0,"I think you're probably right about it being an ego thing, and my therapist said the same. I'm not sure if that's ENTIRELY it, as I still hold these relationship delusions with her, but I don't think I'm in a good place to judge. And I keep trying to tell myself that she may have done it regardless.

I actually did visit a doctor and he took blood and everything seemed fine. He believes it was totally exhaustion related, and gave me a small scrip of erection pills to prevent it from happening again. 

And I actually have hooked up with another girl in an attempt to get over this, and everything worked fine down there. It helped but only very temporarily. I wasn't attracted to her at all."
dating_advice,eqit15z,t1_eqir9rz,1560093130.0,"Absolutely. Aside from the healing after my breakup, loneliness has never really been an issue for me. I've lived alone, and I've been fine with it. But after THIS, I'm utterly consumed by loneliness. It's like it's shaken my whole world up."
depression,eptmtty,t3_bvup45,1559493447.0,"This was 100% me last night. I'm lucky to have a good female friend that will take me out on a weekend night and have drinks with me and help cheering me up, and usually it helps alot. Last night however, every time I was being lifted up emotionally, there felt like there was something inside of me telling me ""no. you cannot be happy. remember."" and I was dragged back down."
dating_advice,ep9zgbe,t1_ep8p2ev,1559119040.0,"I know, I know. It's just all I can think about. It woke me up out of a dead sleep tonight"
dating_advice,ep7jyq8,t1_ep73cin,1559082775.0,And to be clear.. you WOULDN'T suggest texting her (for a 5th time) and seeing if I can take her out again.. right..? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòî
dating_advice,ep7jpnx,t1_ep76egr,1559082672.0,"I'm trying man. I'm trying to set up more than 1 date a week, and going out and meeting new people if the date falls through, and yet it hasn't helped at all long term, and I'm going absolutely broke financially."
dating_advice,ep7j4x3,t1_ep73cin,1559082486.0,"100% man. It's insane how many things about her that I KNOW I wouldn't have been ok with. ""Red flags"" if you will. She lived with her ex husband that she had a kid ruth and also co-owns a business with, for one. Even THAT night I was thinking she was only ""ok"" attraction wise. ""If I never hear from this girl again, I'll be ok"". And yet, here I sit- depressed and with almost feelings of nostalgia from our SINGLE night together and the month of texting we had. I really believe if I'd have ended the night with a kiss or a hug, I wouldn't be damn near in love with this girl right now.."
dating,ep1a3vm,t3_btin3r,1558986570.0,"I will say this: I've NEVER felt butterflies. I've hit it off with women on dates, in bars ect. But I've never felt those butterflies people talk about."
relationships,eokon5w,t1_eokmzrg,1558659442.0,"Man it was tooootally unintended to grow as attached as I did as quickly as I did. I really think it was just the intimacy in general that did it. And I actually DIDN'T plan on taking her home. It was her suggestion and my heart dropped and I thought tho myself, ""FINALLY"". I didn't know it would be as dangerous as it ended up being. And I knew better than to chase her. I don't know wtf I was thinking. It was driving me insane. And STILL I almost fantasize about just being able to text her ""hey"" and getting a response."
dating,eo9l8bz,t1_eo9kc6v,1558394065.0,"I hate to hear that, but refreshed to hear it's ""not only me"" at the same time. The lack of closure definitely has me spinning. 

The ""what ifs"" is what I think has me stuck. If I'd have just kissed her good night after dinner. If I'd have not taken her home and played guitars with her while she sang then watched game of thrones until 5 am.

 I definitely wish I was the kind of guy that could say ""oh she's not into me? Well screw her!"". But it having been my first date in 2 years after my ex fiance left, I was so anxious and nervous leading up to it. When I saw everything was actually going GREAT with this girl despite my reservations and that we seemed to really be into each other...I guess the ghosting hit particularly hard."
dating,eo91wu4,t3_bqyn62,1558380141.0,"I'm a little over a month into finally diving into the dating game after being single for 2 years and I'm so with you. I'm already exhausted. 

First date was with a girl I talked to for a month through text, went out, had an incredible time, connected in every way, more common interests than even my closest friends.  Eventually got back to my place and I couldn't keep it up because I was up 24 hrs at that point. Got ghosted and couldn't help myself from continuing to reach out. 

Been on 3 dates since then, but this girl's still on my mind 24-7, and it's thrown me into a full on depression."
