 In my experience, I Didn’t have a lot of crushes anyways. But, people don’t think it’s normal to go without someone. I think it’s to the point where serial dating is more acceptable than being single. 

 I would hazard to guess that this is truer in western countries like the US, where the culture is often values the individual and increase the need for a single person who fills the role of various friends, family, etc."

I think I understand how you feel.You are clearly an attractive person, but something is telling them they have a shot with you. That something just might be the way you carry yourself. I think that’s why I’ve had a few guys like that attracted to me. I mean, there’s a number of reasons why people have interest in other people; however, these ones in particular know that they’re type won’t be accepted by most so they seek out those they think will tolerate their BS. I like to think of it as temporary ugliness in the scenic route. 

 But I also worry that the men of quality are far and in between and that these guys outnumber them, and that they’re not interested in me because I’m not good enough. 

Then I just kinda recenter on myself. My sense of purpose goes beyond finding a partner, but that’s not to say that isn’t important-just not as important as being a decent/dare-I-say-good person and achieving what I want... like my dream jobs or building up my tribe."

Now we’re insulting Tiffany Haddish, a black woman who is pretty damn unproblematic outside of her normal behavior which is deemed negative because she doesn’t adhere to THEIR level of respectable... because we’re brainwashed into thinking their is only one RIGHT (often confused with WHITE) way to be?! 

 This reminds me of Tomorrow from “Wine in the Wildreness” by Alice Childress. Tommy leaves everyone lookin stupid because she exposes them for  falling into the trap, or this idea that being respectable enough in the white person’s eyes means you are respectable and equal to them in all ways-including as the oppressors. And you can sub Tommy’s character and white peoples’ (a certain type of WASP or white person’s-obviously not all white people’s-) idea of respectable for any number of groups’. The idea isn’t to impress or conform to someone’s idea of how you should be in order for them to treat you right. 

 And, honestly, it seems like being a good person is hugely underrated now a days in favor of a sort of perfect person that doesn’t exist.

Also, it’s they been had Kpop, so now they’re branching out into Hip Hop and taking a lot inspiration (like the white people here) from that genre.

Like, clothing now is cheap and the quality shows it. Also it uses a ton of water, and makes peeps pennies coming from the wrong place. With that in mind, most of the ethical brands are super expensive and not my taste at all. Id suggest vintage or second hand stuff, but it’s not super easy to shop ethically if you don’t got money like that. 


If you don’t want to or have read my above rant, I shop at: 

Etsy- for vintage stuff and new stuff (some of the vintage stuff is cheaper than on other site)                           
Thred Up

(Not gonna lie) Old Navy... occasionally                                 
And I’ve gotten a few T-shirt’s from like Red-bubble and Society Six... they’re not cheap,I’m not sure they’re ethical, but their tshirts with stuff you actually want on a tshirt                                                                                        
I like lolita/larme kei clothing and recently purchased some stuff from Wunderwelt (not sure about the quality but i got some second hand dresses that are on hold due to covid) 



ASOS is suppose to have some upcycled and/or vintage clothing                                                                        

Urban Outfitters has a similar thing going on... though not all of its stuff is all that environmentally friendly or people... “friendly” kinda like ASOS

I’m kinda joking. I know this is some semi-learned/ innate behavior-but, you’re not about to solve these problems by getting on Reddit and calling someone else selfish for finding a little light in the darkness. 


 2) I mean, really this a break from the norm and people are having to take stock of their lives outside of their usual work routine. So, how you mad that things were so hectic and hard on SOOO MANY PEOPLE that the find some solace in a pandemic? Oh-wait, people are dying... so any and all thoughts and feelings not centered on that 100% of the time are wrong and insignificant. 

3) This is quite possibly a taste of what we can expect in the future due to other viruses and automation.

Periods,foip04n,t3_g7nzj3,1587792515.0,"I actually got pretty lucky yesterday, I figured I’d be starting my hell week soon and put a cup in just in case. Woke up, and blood in cup. 

I’d suggest a few things:
Invest in a menstrual  cup
-check out sites on cup types and measuring yourself 

Invest in reusable pads and/or undies (you can use these with a cup or simply rely on the cup) 

There are also reusable tampons 

Period tracker app              
-I cannot guarantee any because I don’t use them             
-you’ll probably have to look them up and go through some trial and error                                                               
-I can’t say if they can give you an approximate date because it’s been so long since I used one, but it might be worth it (I think there a plenty that are free)"

Violence isn’t always (dare I say, hardly ever) the answer. And, you might not have raised an abuser of people, the law (not that the law is always right or always needs to be obeyed), themselves, etc. But there is a chance you raised someone who resents you and/or lacks trust in themselves and in others-or is too trusting of everyone else’s judgment. So they think they deserve whatever they get, even violence."

 In my experience, kids do make jokes about skin color and that can be worsened if that’s paired with insults about her lack of.. was it just black friends or friends? Either way, I would suggest you inform her about sunscreen and how and why everyone needs to use it. Also, overload her with compliments and affection and exposure. Make sure your other kids are exposed to different black people too, it would probably really help her if her older siblings pointed out what they liked about her (and she did the same for them-ya know, make encouragement more of a habit) and try and get them to be more protective of her. 

 I’m mixed too,and my mom felt the need to tell people not to buy me anymore white Barbie dolls (or any other dolls, but I loved Barbie) because my perception of what was beautiful started to become very narrow. And, while that helped, kids and adults alike sort of put stuff on me. The black side of my family sort of made me feel as though my Mexican heritage was what made me beautiful, and kids said I was too dark to be related to my dad (there was also me not speaking Spanish, but that dad comment hurt more). What made me feel good was seeing people that looked like me in The Proud Family and That’s So Raven and shows like that, but also learning more about my people. I mean, like black panthers, Ancient African societies, and our accomplishments. Maybe throw in some podcast, and black musicians like India Arie. And, It’s like what Common Sense Media was saying, you gotta watch what you and other people say around your kids. Like, with body image, if you pick at yourself than they begin to imitate and expand upon it."

blackladies,fo6xdck,t3_g61ggz,1587568489.0,"My first concern is with the treatment of the children. Personally, I wonder what are people’s motives behind having children-biological or not. So, when I see people adopting children outside of their race, my only concern is if they’ll actually love and care for that child. I don’t want to even see that people are debating over whether or not someone “accidentally” killed/abused their adopted baby.

Edit: I just wanna say that this my first, as well as one of the most important, concerns;however, I do worry about culture exposure."
