schizoaffective,feznaim,t3_eqw1xe,1579459276.0,"Been on meds for about five years now, I will admit the abilify for me doesn’t make the voices go away but it does make them more manageable, i.e easier to know what’s real what’s not. 

I have heard for others it makes them go away completely, but the key thing is to take the meds everyday how you are prescribed. I get mine as a depot injection every month and honestly it’s a helluva lot easier than tablets. It makes you leave the house, makes you interact with people and you have to go cos they nag you if you don’t. 

I had an awful high school career cos I was struggling with my disorder undiagnosed and lost a lot of friends because I said and did horrible things.

HOWEVER. These people were toxic and didn’t understand I was sick. I have apologised for how I acted and some of them still won’t accept it. But others have. So the point I’m trying to make is; forgive yourself for what happened. And if your friends are true friends they will forgive you too. 

Good luck on your journey to a better place. It will take time, but the point is to keep trying."

schizoaffective,f74qztd,t1_f74nuo9,1573406716.0,"It’s understandable to be worried. But as annoyingly as all the YouTubers go on about it, burnout is a real thing and can affect all of us. But it’s important when you pick it back up to take it easy and not be too disappointed if things have slackened off and you’re not as good as you once were."
schizoaffective,f739iae,t3_duaq2i,1573389459.0,"I still love music. I used to be a guitarist but the medication I was on made my hands and legs seize up and I had difficulty controlling my hands as well as I used to. I might not play as much anymore but I still love music and found creating music digitally on things like logic still fun and a great way to get all my creative juices out. 

Recently I’ve started drawing and have been a lot better at using my hands so picking guitar back up could be a possibility in my future. 

What I’m trying to say is don’t let the medicine or creative block get you down. Find another way of creative expression and if you need to take a break, do so."

I don’t get it all that often anymore due to medication that stabilises my mood. Have you tried speaking to someone about this? Be it a professional or someone who you trust?"
schizoaffective,eypm90o,t3_cy3nvr,1567304245.0,Fun fact (maybe) this is known as flat effect. You feel apathetic about almost everything and find it hard to convey how you may actually feel (if you feel anything at all).
learnart,eypm25d,t3_cy3p4u,1567304084.0,Try a wimmelbilder (teeming picture). You could do lots of little pieces like this surrounding the first one and make it quite interesting!
learnart,eyplnw4,t3_cy43t8,1567303751.0,"Don’t think about the head as a flat surface. It’s round (obviously) but here your just drawing the eyes as if they were facing forward. Try and imagine what they would look like at that angle. The left eye would be a bit squashed and the right eye would be bigger. If in doubt, look up references. And keep practicing! Hope this helps!"
DMAcademy,eynkbdw,t3_cxrzxw,1567250808.0,For a bard specific one. I made a puzzle using boom whackers. The idea is to read a sheet of music and conduct the other party members correctly. It’s not a super difficult piece (ocarina of times song of time if anyone’s interested) and if they get stuck they can roll a performance for hints to the sheet music.

DnD,ey3fe18,t3_cvd2to,1566763034.0,"When describing things don’t go too over board in the details. Players have active imaginations and don’t need to many. Evil squeegee on YouTube did a great 3 part series on how to describe like a pro. The general idea is:

Gist of the thing your describing 
Pick two senses plus sight
A landmark
Then the crisis.

People will tend to focus on the crisis first so leave that till the very end. Don’t spend to long describing that otherwise they’ll start thinking about what their having for dinner that night. 

Hope this is useful!"
schizoaffective,ey3enn2,t3_cvd5zt,1566762513.0,"I know it might not work for everyone. But I use grounding techniques.

5 things you can see
4 things you can hear
3 things you can smell
2 things you can feel
1 thing you can taste. 

I use small hard sweets or chewing gum to help with the last one and a squishy toy and a small pebble for the second last. 

Hope this helps!"

She casts a spell and I told them to make a wisdom saving throw. They all fail and I tell them to pass their character sheets to the left. Next thing they know, they wake up and their bodies have been swapped. They had the best reactions ever!"
