SubredditDrama,fptus8p,t1_fpshdqw,1588898683.0,"That's what I always tell people who say they don't understand why ""white pride"" isn't okay. Black pride is based on race/skin color because black people didn't have a say when their ancestors came here, and many don't know where they're originally from. That was ripped from them. Plus black people were and still are treated like shit for being black, not for being from Kenya.

I'm 75% Irish. My grandparents are Irish immigrants. I love learning about the culture and history and all that fun stuff. I feel proud to be Irish. That's dandy. I wouldn't say I'm proud to be white. It's fucking weird and basically meaningless. None of us white people are defined based on being white, but black people are.

It's not complicated. I get that some people never thought about it like that before (when I was younger I didn't consider the reasons) but once someone points it out, why is so hard to be like. Oh. Okay, cool. Irish pride!"

I know the CDC is updating guidelines about masks, and I'm glad my inlaws aren't trying to buy up real ones that medical professionals need, but I just feel... weird about it?

I mentioned it to my friends in our ongoing group chat, as one of them is a biochemist who works for a big name lab and another is a hospital janitor who primarily cleans surgical suites. They cautioned that my inlaws need to understand what these cloth masks can actually do, and what they can't, and how important it is to take care of them/decontaminate them properly if they do use them.

I have another friend (30M) in the group chat who's been in full panic mode who asked if I could make them for him, his husband, and their soon-to-be roommate.

Now my SIL might ask me to make them for her and her family. And I'm just like... I feel so much ambiguity about it. I'm worried I'm doing the wrong thing by making these. But I also don't want to turn them away and risk them taking up supplies that others need more.

All that to say... every time I've tried to stop meds I fucking meltdown. I have panic attacks and crying spells that won't stop. I spiral out of control. I never knew how bad it was until I started then stopped meds. I lost my libido completely and wanted to enjoy sex again. Though my sex drive comes back, so do all the horrid effects of anxiety and depression.

I've accepted that I can either be content or have great sex. My husband told me he'd rather I was happy than a wild thing in bed. Therapy helped with the issues meds couldn't. But it doesn't help with the things my meds help. I'm sorry, you're 20 years old and to you don't want to be medicated for the rest of your life. I'm 30 now and I really don't either. But what else can we do?

And I mean, I exercise regularly. I've a wonderful husband and two great dogs who comfort me when I need. My friends are an incredible support system.

I worked retail selling bicycles when I was in high school and college, so I know what it's like when you HAVE to bug people. We had to greet people and ask if they needed help. If they said no thanks, I said, ""Sure thing, just let me know if you do."" And that was it. I didn't pester them again.

AmItheAsshole,fdnmxz6,t1_fdnju9h,1578589141.0,"The furniture guy did make me feel like I was being harassed. We told him we didn't need help more times than I can count. So when I saw him the next time we went in, I ran away from him. What leopardsocks says it the intention. Disengaging in a silly way. It always felt more like I was mocking myself and they'd probably be laughing at my dumbass, not the other way around. I'm the buffoon.

I've only done it four times in about five years, and as I've said in other comments, it's reserved for people who are pushy and won't fuck off, or scammers. Never greeters, people stocking shelves and ask if I need help, girlscouts, etc. Pushy, asshole salespeople only."
AmItheAsshole,fdnlc9o,t1_fdnfo3y,1578588201.0,"I've only done it four times in the past few years, and I reserve it for pushy sales people who don't seem to respond to, ""I would like to browse, I'll let you know if I need any help.""

I have really intense social anxiety, and when I was younger I would literally let a sales person talk to me for an hour because I was afraid of being rude or saying no. I used to buy MLM products from relatives because I felt guilty when they'd take the time to try to sell me something. Over time I started learning to be assertive, how to say, ""No, I'm good."" Often I'll tell sales people, ""I really don't want to waste your time. I appreciate your help, but I'm not going to buy X.""

This guy would not back off. No matter how many different times or ways we told him that we did not want help, he persisted. It made me angry. It made me think of all the times I felt bullied into listening to a pitch, the times I bought things I didn't want because I felt guilty. There were times I literally wanted to run away from these people and shout LEAVE ME ALONE!

So I thought, man what would someone do if I literally fled from them? Like, wow, that would be really ridiculous and silly, and they'd probably just think I was insane. Good. It'll be amusing to me and they can go ahead and think I'm nuts, and leave me alone. So I did the thing where I ran away from the guy at the furniture store.

If it's any consolation, it's reserved for people who won't fuck off. Not for people whose job it is to check in with customers or risk getting reprimanded. Not for greeters. Not for girl scouts or boy scouts. Salespeople who won't fuck off who just want to sell me something no matter how many times I say no. And the table people because I have actually fallen for that scam with the power company. It's a scam. I don't give a fuck about anyone who willingly participates in a scam."

Conveniently forgetting details that she'd rather not remember. Right down to being involuntarily committed for threatening suicide then blaming my dad for it (they divorced when I was little).

I'm not a lawyer but it's clear as day LAOP has no case for any of it, and has a long, hard road ahead of him if he doesn't start really working towards his mental health. I feel bad for him, much the same way that I feel bad for my mom when I think about how I don't grieve for her being gone, I grieve thinking about how sad it is that I dont really miss her, how chaotic and difficult her life was, how she must have felt very, very lonely. I hope he accepts all the help he can get.

He wasn't even trying to play a trick on me, he just used the box to make wrapping easier. I remember opening it and feeling so... not seen and confused. I'm 10 years old, why would he think an air humidifier would be something I wanted? I didn't want to be ungrateful so I thanked him and put it off to the side to open the next give. He started laughing and said, ""No, no, that's just an old box, open it up.""

Like, it's not just a joke, especially not as a child. It was only for a few moments for me, and not even intentionally, and I felt really hurt by it. It wasn't even like, WAH, I WANTED A REMOTE CONTROL CAR!!! It was like... my dad knows me so little that he couldn't even get me a pair of comfy pajamas or something. IDK man, take a lesson from it.

I don't feel particularly close to my brothers or cousins or anything, but I do like seeing my other family members for holidays or big occasions. But my husband's family wants to see us all. The. Time. All the friggin time! It took a while for me to get used to seeing his sister or parents as often as once a week. And I like seeing them, because they are a warm and welcoming family.

Especially gay women who date bisexuals without trying to tell me I'm a lesbian and am in denial about it or a tourist. Guys have always liked me, too. I'm not as popular with women as I am with men; the girls I fell for rarely felt the same way about me, even the gay ones... I ultimately married a man who I love with all my heart. And it's definitely easier being able to hide under straight camouflage.

But it frustrates me that most people think marrying a man means I'm not actually on the gay spectrum. I'd rather watch romantic lesbian porn than straight porn any day. I develop crushes on other women (harmless ones). Why aren't I allowed to be interested in both? Oh well..."

relationships,f7ccz09,t3_dvahx4,1573589548.0,"My husband and I have been together for almost five years (married for two). We do not yell at each other. I honestly can only remember one or two times when either of us raised our voices (and it was more than likely after having too much to drink, I could not tell you what the ""fight"" was about). It is a cardinal rule of our relationship that we never, ever put each other down or call each other names. The worst fight I can think of in recent memory, I was berating *myself* about losing something important and ranting about how dumb I was and he told me to calm down (he was helping me look), then I told him in a normal speaking voice to go to Hell. I went for a walk or something. About 30 minutes later I apologized to him and told him I should not have spoken to him that way. He apologized for telling me to calm down when I was upset, because my frustration was valid.

That was over a year ago. That was the last argument I can remember us having. It is not normal to scream and shout insults. Conflict is normal - but how he handles conflict is absolutely not. If my husband and I disagree about something or feel frustrated, it's a very simple, ""Hey, I feel x when y. I would appreciate if you would z. I love you very much, and I know you never intend to frustrate or hurt me."" Like... it's respectful. We talk about our feelings. We give each other the benefit of the doubt and empathize. We don't assume anyone can read our minds. I remember once he was working a lot more than he usually does (he has a 9-5 but he had started doing Door Dash on the side). I started feeling hurt because it felt like he maybe didn't want to be around me? Had I done something that made him want to be gone all the time?

So one evening he said he was going to go Door Dashing 5 minutes after he got home. So I admitted to him that I felt sad and a little hurt, and that I was worried he was avoiding me. I asked him to explain why he'd been Door Dashing so much. He hugged me and said that of course he wasn't avoiding me; his dad had just lost his job (which I did know) and he wanted to make sure if his parents needed help, we'd have plenty of extra money. I felt so much better knowing that he just wanted to save up a little extra cash for his parents. And all it took was me expressing how I felt calmly, not accusing him of anything, and asking if he could help me understand. And then he did.

Do not stay with this person. As others have said, he is abusive. His behavior is not normal or okay. I hope you can leave him and find someone who will treat you how you deserve to be treated."
