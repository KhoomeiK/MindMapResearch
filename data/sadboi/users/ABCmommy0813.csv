TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7s8d8,t1_fn7s4qg,1586726582.0,Lmfao; the CDC lies and isn‚Äôt very accurate. And those scientists are the same ones who have said this was a man made virus.

Again, not everyone who has this virus needs to be hospitalized. Now someone like me; who is high risk, probably might have to be. But I was very sick in Dec; and it‚Äôs now coming to light that whoever might be have been sick in November/December could have had this and they were just saying it was the flu. It took almost three weeks to recover"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7re3s,t1_fn7r7i7,1586726100.0,Or a simple Google search. If you can‚Äôt seem to Google then that‚Äôs on you not me.

On the other hand I will NOT support this shut down any longer than it has already been shut down. Especially when it‚Äôs ILLEGAL to be doing so. Those masks are not helping prevent this virus; it‚Äôs just a virus; it‚Äôll go away. No matter how hard we try, or what measures we take it won‚Äôt go away the way we are doing it.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7p65g,t1_fn7p0e2,1586724825.0,"Probably because she‚Äôs not a sheep like most people. You do know what most governors are doing is highly illegal correct. And you‚Äôve been to the doctors, which means you‚Äôve most likely been exposed to the virus unfortunately."

I will say regardless of if your abuser is a trans it doesn‚Äôt matter; if they broke the law they need to be in jail. You protecting him/her is just telling them that they can do whatever they did to you to someone else.
