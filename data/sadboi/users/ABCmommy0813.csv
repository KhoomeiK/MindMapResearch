TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7yqeg,t1_fn7ynd1,1586730332.0,It was published that it leaked from a lab in China because a jackass was studying bats that carry the disease. It wasn’t because some idiot ate a raw bat.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7u9de,t1_fn7u3rw,1586727756.0,Yes it would have because mine did the same thing! They test the exactly the same way as the flu. They weren’t testing for this virus four months ago; sheeple
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7u6fb,t1_fn7u2cp,1586727709.0,Lmfao. Most first line health care workers I know aren’t that worried. But it’s okay. You keep being a mindless sheep. It’s okay.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7tt7k,t1_fn7tnno,1586727498.0,Yeah so did everyone else back in November/December. My entire house was put on tamiflu; even my boyfriend and I wasn’t living with him full tome at that time. But now there are sources coming out saying what we thought was the flu was this virus.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7tcls,t1_fn7t4lf,1586727228.0,"You’re being highly narrow minded. I believed all of the same things you did the first two weeks we were shut down. I’m gonna ask you like I asked someone else. Do you ride a motorcycle, does your husband, any of your friends? Do you like going to the beach? Do you enjoy going to the public pool? Do you like taking vacations in the summer time with your family? Do you know how the economy works?!?!? You keep listening to Trumps Admin and everything China is telling you."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7sov2,t1_fn7sjgf,1586726845.0,No school will be reopened this school year dumb dumb. You were diagnosed with the flu because no one was testing for this in December. If you think you’re helping you aren’t. When you go out you are already exposed to the virus and bringing it back home.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7sjv4,t1_fn7sf5b,1586726764.0,Nope because the CDC has lied. They are saying people who died who just haven’t been diagnosed with this virus is why they died and that’s not true. This virus doesn’t cause heart attacks
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7sftp,t1_fn7sc4d,1586726700.0,"You clearly are the ones who think this virus was caused by a man in China eating a raw bat, and that’s okay. You deserve a pat on the head."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7s8d8,t1_fn7s4qg,1586726582.0,Lmfao; the CDC lies and isn’t very accurate. And those scientists are the same ones who have said this was a man made virus.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7s33l,t1_fn7s1zb,1586726497.0,No actually I’m not....
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7s24s,t1_fn7rzom,1586726482.0,They aren’t dying in mass numbers dumbass
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7rxam,t1_fn7rq2i,1586726407.0,You keep believing what CNN is saying to you. Sheep.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7rskp,t1_fn7rnn2,1586726333.0,Dude those numbers are so high because if you die from a heart attack and have the virus inside their system and haven’t been diagnosed are being told they died of the virus; which is false.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7rof5,t1_fn7rdvn,1586726267.0,"Everything is going to shit right now! I have to travel two hours round trip if I want to buy a bottle of vodka. I have to make sure I’m in the house by 8pm; which is BS. Again, if the hospitals would only admit those that needed to be admitted we wouldn’t be so short. Again, not everyone who has this virus needs to be hospitalized. Now someone like me; who is high risk, probably might have to be. But I was very sick in Dec; and it’s now coming to light that whoever might be have been sick in November/December could have had this and they were just saying it was the flu. It took almost three weeks to recover"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7re3s,t1_fn7r7i7,1586726100.0,Or a simple Google search. If you can’t seem to Google then that’s on you not me. A lot of medical communities have stated that to live your life. This is too extreme. Do you know how the economy works? Do you know how badly the economy will tank if we don’t open soon?
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7qvzq,t1_fn7qtez,1586725805.0,Oh my god....you have to be dumber than a rock. It doesn’t cover the virus spread; but sure does cover the government shutting states down.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7qp6t,t1_fn7qkjz,1586725696.0,Yeah; we can’t keep the country on lockdown for two years; you’re a huge sheeple and dumby if you think we can. And not everyone who has/gets this virus has to be hospitalized you do know that right
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7qlzg,t1_fn7qk4r,1586725644.0,Go read the constitution
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7ql45,t1_fn7q7pm,1586725631.0,"I never said I believed it wasn’t serious; I do think it CAN be deadly and be serious to those high risk patients (🙌🏻🙋🏼‍♀️). On the other hand I will NOT support this shut down any longer than it has already been shut down. Especially when it’s ILLEGAL to be doing so. Those masks are not helping prevent this virus; it’s just a virus; it’ll go away. No matter how hard we try, or what measures we take it won’t go away the way we are doing it. Thankfully my state saw a 498 difference in numbers from yesterday. But I also will not wipe down cardboard boxes."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7ptt0,t1_fn7prji,1586725197.0,Lmfao; it’s called not being a sheep and not believing everything CNN has said. But hey you keep doing you boo.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7pler,t1_fn7pb1w,1586725065.0,You really don’t think this virus is gonna go away on Iraq on do you? Do you really think keeping our country shut down for however long they deem fit is actually going to get rid of this virus do you?
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7p65g,t1_fn7p0e2,1586724825.0,"Probably because she’s not a sheep like most people. You do know what most governors are doing is highly illegal correct. And you’ve been to the doctors, which means you’ve most likely been exposed to the virus unfortunately."
HellsKitchen,fn7p291,t3_fy0auh,1586724762.0,Thank god!!!!! I was wondering if this was coming back or not.

ptsd,fn7npux,t1_fn7m6lm,1586723983.0,"It’s fine! I just wasn’t sure how to respond since it was jumbled. Writing isn’t my string suit either and all of my therapists have suggested it. I would still keep trying to find someone or ask if they have a waiting list you could be placed on. I suffer from PTSD since I was about 8, depression, panic attacks, and anxiety plus post partum and something called pre-menstrual dysphroic disorder. So I’m going legit insane. Plus I’m doing 50/50 between my moms house (and my mom and grandmother legit drive me to the point of wanting to cut my wrists when I am at their place.) and between my boyfriends house."
TLCUnexpected,fn7lbeb,t1_fn5shgl,1586722612.0,Yup! I call my mom by meme when talking to the girls or referring to the girls. And my grandmother is referred to nanny; I don’t even remember the last time I called her grandma.

And exactly no one deserves to be absurd and that’s why when me and my boyfriend argue we are slowly starting to learn the signs of either one of us becoming annoyed then we are away from the conversation and write a note in my phone that states “finish said conversation started on such and such date at such and such time.” If it was an important thing then we will bring it back up 24 hours later. Which has worked well for us so far, we haven’t had to bring up any conversation again."
ptsd,fn7k64w,t3_fzr6df,1586721952.0,It was very hard to understand. This was all jumbled together. But your therapist should be able to do phone sessions to get you through.

My kids are why I’m trying to better myself, I’m gonna be entering into DBT and EDSMR once this is all over and said with. My boyfriend has been a huge help and has encouraged me to realize when I’m being pushed and to just step away. Even with him when we argue; he says to me “look I can see you’re becoming annoyed with the conversation let’s just pause and resume later.” So her mental health issues are not an excuse."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fn7jqzd,t1_fn7j4g6,1586721713.0,When people say he pushed her buttons so he deserved that is pretty much saying that because me and my boyfriend when mad at each other push each other’s buttons we deserve to be abused.....

ptsd,fn7ii6g,t3_fzs37i,1586721005.0,So I do this; this quarantine has really screwed me all types of up. I’m also diabetic. But I also have some problems with my cycle. So when my cycle is about to hit I’m like you. I crave everything and just want to eat all of the time because I’m craving something but can’t figure out what I want to eat. But I would advise to try drinking a bottle of water first; and after 20-30 minutes you are still hungry then find a snack.
foodnetwork,fn541mv,t3_fzml0s,1586655416.0,I can’t stand Buddy. He is such a sore loser. They always score him higher when he wins. But if Duff wins it’s by a closer call. And Ralph’s ego is starting to show. He has been around Buddy too long.

I suffer from mental health, and had an incident and was not given the easy way out!!!!!!!! All because she has a fan base.

Degrassi,fn2166g,t1_fn2142m,1586575145.0,Yes; but it’s still Hollywood in a sense. And it’s a TV show. They needed that drama.

jerseyshore,fn1jesb,t1_fn1iq0y,1586563273.0,You’d think. After my toxic relationship with my ex husband I refuse to stay in an unhappy relationship. Jenni is being an idiot at this point.

jerseyshore,fn1hlmf,t1_fn1g6sv,1586562180.0,100% agree with you on this!!!!! His mouth is so much bigger than his face. Like it didn’t match his face. And we all know he grabbed Angelina at the club. And for Jenni to take him back. Ugh. He does give off the creepy vibe.

I will say regardless of if your abuser is a trans it doesn’t matter; if they broke the law they need to be in jail. You protecting him/her is just telling them that they can do whatever they did to you to someone else. So you either stick up for yourself and protect his/her future partners or you go like your mom is saying and be an uncooperative witness.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fmil8y7,t1_fmil00y,1586111822.0,"Me and my boyfriend were just talking about that! Trump wants us opened by summer; which isn’t unrealistic.
