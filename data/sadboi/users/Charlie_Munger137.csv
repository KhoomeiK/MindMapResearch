AskACanadian,fqjlvp0,t1_fqjjpn6,1589411806.0,"Yes, I live in a democracy where I can talk about whatever I want. You do believe in the charter of rights and freedoms don’t you?

Oh Trudeau changed! Well that makes it okay for him to still be in power when lesser sexual crimes by lesser ministers in his own party required they step down. 

You don’t have to take my word for it. Name any economist you want, they will tell you the US economy has performed better under Trump than the Canadian economy has under Trudeau. It’s a fact.

Trump is conceded scumbag. Saying a group of protesters, some of whom were nazis, are good people is hardly as bad as trying to influence the Ukraine to look into political opponents. Again I put up the SNC Lavilin affair as something far more heinous than these pebbles you think are boulders.

Again I think you covid argument is interesting but tenuous. If more than a million Americans die I think you have a much stronger argument (assuming Canada didn’t see proportional death).

I didn’t say Trudeau was worse, I said he has done and said worse and still in power. So to the OP question, yes if Trudeau was a right wing scumbag he could probably get away with the same or more than trump because he is so pretty."

Yes the victim confirmed the Kokanee groper is real: https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/woman-accused-trudeau-breaks-silence-1.4737511 

In a debate about whether Trudeau would still be in power if he had done the things Trump has this is a relevant point. I live in a society where it doesn’t matter if someone doesn’t want to talk about something. This sexual predator is in office.  Oh, but he apologized, right so then it’s okay.

No, Trump is still a scumbag, even if he apologizes for the rest of his life. Wrong answer.

Again, “best economy in decades” is hilarious given (i) it is demonstrably false, and (ii) what growth we do have is created by debt and immigration alone.

To point (i) as you can see GDP growth which is thee proxy for the economy demonstrates our economy is not in fact as you say. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=CA 

Mocking the disabled and thinking his own daugther is hot falls into black face/India costume party level stuff. Being endorsed by nazis is not something Trump has done or said. 

Blaming Trump for all the covid deaths is an interesting argument. I think it is a failure of private medicine which Trump didn’t create, and it is Govoners’ responsibilities to run healthcare. Now thinking it’s a democratic hoax and being a moron have led to more deaths, however, it is not all that different from the Swedish approach.

US GDP growth 2019 2.3%
CAN GDP growth 2019 1.6%

Again US carbon emissions have fallen, Canada’s have not.

Your credibility is lacking when what you say is demonstrably false. Maybe insulting IQ and intelligence is something you should save for people who might not be informed."
AskACanadian,fqj15kq,t1_fqim5ol,1589403630.0,"So if The lady Trump wanted to grab said it was okay, then his actions are okay? Trudeau actually sexually assaulted someone, trump bragged about women letting him touch them.

Right I forgot he apologized for his multiple instances of a black face.  I guess if Trump just apologized, those things come off his tally?

Your comments on the economy are uninformed. spending $30B on our grandchildren’s credit card to generate economic activity while Canada’s investment base is washed away is so far from “the best economy in decades” lol. That sounds a Trumpian.

US emissions actually shrank in 2019. Canada cannot day the same.

You haven’t named a single a thing he has done though that is worse. Better economy, environment and arguably has done less slimy stuff. I think they are all scum bags. Scheer included. Thinking Trudeau’s poops rainbows is comical."
AskACanadian,fqijwtk,t1_fqijgq5,1589396987.0,Care to discuss it? Trudeau has survived worse scandals than Trump.
AskACanadian,fqihfgh,t3_gj0y19,1589396037.0,"He’s done and said worse than Trump and is still PM, so yes he would still be PM.

The Kokanee groper is a far worse incident than Trump saying he can grab her by the p***y. 

I would put Trudeaus multiple incidents of black face up against the rambling of Trump dementia.

And if Trudeau had done policy more like Trump our economy would be stronger but our international virtue signalling and posing means Trudeau has done way worse in this front.


Even Trump environmental achievements dwarf Trudeau’s if you want to look at results rather than agreements.

Finally, Trudeau’s obvious malleability by SNC Lavin and the lengths to which his party went to silence the first aboriginal attorney general is probably worse than anything Trump has said or done.

Trudeau is too pretty and covers up all manifest if political sins. He could kill some fort and tell us we’ll all learned a lesson from it and still be PM."
