Look, I treated combat PTSD for 8 years, hit my burn-out and moved on to Crisis Work. One thing I know for sure after reading your note is that you're invested in his recovery perhaps more than he is. He might need to see a different therapist and that is possible in a Vet Center which is staffed by vets in the therapist roll. Most are good and the centers are small/low key. 

Yet, if he doesn't stop drinking or finding reasons to downplay therapy he won't improve. He must find his motivations to succeed. You aren't responsible for his PTSD. Neither is he. Trauma did that. 

See if he'll go to a Vet Center. Sometimes they have groups you can join that teach you how to take care of yourself while you love the man inside that traumatized person. All the best."
