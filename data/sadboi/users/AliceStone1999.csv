Ben10,fqcjowi,t3_gi4kan,1589259991.0,"üëΩ Welcome back, plumbers! üëΩ

With our Ben 10 anniversary zine becoming a reality, we'd like to decide which charity organization we'll be donating to. 

We've decided to focus on children's charities this time, since Ben 10 is mainly aimed towards kids (even though some of us have held onto it even until adulthood!) 

You can vote on this poll on the matter: [Link!](http://www.strawpoll.me/20022792)

Ben10,fq3co5f,t3_ggpos8,1589065137.0,"Greetings plumbers! Are you all ready to dive headfirst into the unknown spaces of the galaxy? 

We present to you a project that will surely bring back memories from a forgotten childhood: Ben 15th The Ultimate Journey! 

This is a digital zine project which will be created to celebrate the Ben 10 franchise's 15th year anniversary! You will be able to see your favorite characters again in a new light with the contributions of hopefully many artists and writers! 

All canonical entries will be featured, such as:

‚Ä¢ Ben 10 (2005 version) 
‚Ä¢ Ben 10 Alien Force
‚Ä¢ Ben 10 Ultimate Alien
‚Ä¢ Ben 10 Omniverse
‚Ä¢ AU's

Half of the zine/digital merchandise earnings will be donated to a children's oriented charity which we are still looking into, and the rest will be given to compensate our contributors. 

Are you interested in our project? Then fill out our interest check: [Link!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScx82EXwzU71RXXNf8LA6hM1m7-nwGlKIjetQO738MGaKK0uA/viewform)

These will close on June 8th so be sure to show us how much you want this to happen! 

It's hero time! :D"

With the current state of the world we live in, as well as an opportunity to share the love and appreciation we have for this amazing show, we have decided to create a special project. 

This project is none other than a zine! A digital book which YOU will be able to purchase and read on the comfort of your home anytime! 

The zine will be focused on the relationship between Jesse and Lake from the Cartoon Network show, Infinity Train. It will contain both art and stories, and they can be either platonic or romantic, focusing on the following prompts:

* Meeting 
* Friendship
* Romance 
* Future
* AU's

All of the earnings from this project will be donated to the World Health Organization as a mean to find a way to combat COVID-19 and provide hospitals with the equipment that they need. 

If you'd like to see this all become a reality, please consider sharing and spreading the word, as well as filling our interest check which you can find right here: [Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUxSkPrky9Yu58LsLslG2NqcxPM_Cx3ZdZlWT2m_3AR42Y8w/viewform)

Also the artwork used in this banner belongs to Xyroni on Instagram and will be changed as soon as we get some artists on board! 

Interest checks will close on June 18th so be sure to fill them out before then! :)"

KingdomHearts,fp38cpb,t3_gb1y29,1588274858.0,"I personally enjoyed DDD as a game with both the mechanics and story, except the time travel which made things 10 times more comfortable confusing lol 

Sora definitely deserves to be a keyblade master and I think it only got rigged since he has so many hearts inside him and he was trying to listen to them all and try and help them, even if he didn't know who they belonged to yet. With so many people depending on him and pushing him in different directions, no wonder he fell into the darkness momentarily."

mentalhealth,fp27855,t3_gatm30,1588256533.0,"I've experienced similar feelings of being tired all the time and just having my emotions ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù and it's usually linked to my depression. There are also times in life when you get to a point in which if you're too stressed you just don't feel it anymore, but it's still very important to have it checked. 

Another thing that it could be would be imbalanced hormones, which is something very common and definitely links to our emotional state without realizing it. Perhaps you could have that checked in the physical aspect? And maybe also visit a psychologist to discuss these feelings?

But it's nothing to worry about of course~"
KingdomHearts,fp1i6kb,t1_fp1htzs,1588236364.0,"Oof now that you mention it they do sound rather similar xD Guess Riku has always given good advice lol

Also yeah maybe down the line once I finish all the games I'll revisit them and finish them in critical to get the secret endings but that will take me forever knowing how bad I am so, yeah üòÖ"
