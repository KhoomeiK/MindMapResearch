getdisciplined,fcoo6ii,t3_eia7kz,1577837166.0,"I try to avoid caffeine completely unless I have an important reason to stay up or need an energy boost. I like to rely on my own natural energy to get me through the day, which means I prioritize getting a good nights sleep. 

Also, if you have caffeine daily you become dependent on it and your body will get used to it, which is not really helping you in any way. 

Finally, caffeine isn’t too good for my anxiety so I try to stay clear of it most of the time. 

That is my personal opinion, but self-discipline means something different to everyone, so consider how it helps/hurts you."

CPTSD,fb1w23m,t1_faz88wa,1576442022.0,"I experience both of these things!! Never even realized not paying attention to my surroundings and CPTSD could be related. 

I once spent like an hour trying to Google where this convenience store that was 2 minutes away from my house was. I grew up going there frequently. I knew the location of it alone but had no idea where it was relative to the rest of the neighbourhood. 

That’s just one incidence of it, but I still never know how to get places unless I am consciously paying attention to how to get there."
Effexor,fa7u06u,t1_fa7oe9w,1575838172.0,"Thanks for the suggestions!! 

Yeah, I am questioning whether or not it’s the Effexor. But I’ve just felt really really shitty thoughts for the past few days and the change happened really abruptly. I’ve been pretty good at changing my thoughts and managing suicidal feelings so the sudden switch with no other explanation threw me off. I then remembered my doctor said that it is possible to happen when starting it or increasing doses, which would make a lot of sense!  

The fact that it can act as a stimulant also makes a lot of sense, my thoughts have been racing quite a bit. I’ll definitely try some mindfulness techniques to slow down and manage them, I think it really could help. Thank you so much for the reply!"

If I spend too much time alone I always spiral into depression and hopelessness or feel like doing something destructive like drinking. I know being with other people will help to remedy it but it’s just so much effort and such a dread to be with others. 
I love being alone but it just always seems to make me feel worse."
BorderlinePDisorder,f95pndn,t3_e2kvrc,1575132842.0,"Definitely speak with a doctor!

Regardless of the diagnosis, the main thing isn’t the label but the treatment for them. Best of luck to you!"

I spent so much time trying to make sense of myself and of all of the things keeping me from being ""normal"" and functional.  I always knew it was something more than depression. As uneasy as it makes me feel, finally having this diagnosis also makes me feel so much more understood. Now that things begin to make more sense, can begin working towards healing. 

As stressful this is, good is and will come out of it, it's just gonna take time for me to fully accept it and work towards it. 

Definitely will spend time in this sub trying to understand more about it and myself. Thank you so much for taking the time to reply!!"

BPD,f80dtwi,t3_dy6vjt,1574126668.0,"It would be super cool if you could look at a monthly overview and select which category you want to look at. For example if you select mood you can see the fluctuations in mood throughout the month (similar to Moodpath app I mentioned), or select appetite, exercise etc."
BPD,f80dl9l,t3_dy6vjt,1574126500.0,"Adding onto my previous comment about wanting to see an fluctuations in mood throughout the day in the overview rather than an average mood - I would also LOVE if you could input energy level as a supplement to mood since both are really indicative of symptoms of depression and bipolar. Sometimes mood isn’t enough of an indicator because that can vary pretty greatly due to external circumstances. 

I have found that tracking energy levels instead of/in addition to moods to be very very useful."
BPD,f80d5dx,t1_f805i1a,1574126185.0,"I have the exact same problem! I find that many apps like Daylio summarize your entire day into one mood which is ineffective if you want to see changes within a day. 

I think the app looks great, but I wish the weekly overview you see at the top near the beginning of the video didn’t just  show 1 mood. My current mood tracking app is Moodpath and I love that in the monthly overview it shows 3 moods per day, helps to see and significant swings throughout the day."

sugarfree,f7092a9,t3_dtz3ao,1573325781.0,I’m on the average side and have passively wanted to lose some weight to get back to the weight where I felt my best. In the 5 months that I quit sugar (I didn’t do much calorie counting & minimal to average cardio) I lost 20 pounds which is pretty impressive. I personally find it’s a lot harder to lose weight when you are on the skinnier side and I think quitting sugar really made the pounds slide off.

Experienced something similar growing up and really repressed the hell out of those memories for most of my life. I haven’t spoken to anyone about it, not even my therapist, because it makes me feel gross and embarrassed and I always doubted that it was a form of “trauma.” Seeing all of these replies in the comments is really validating.

Where do we all go from here?"

BipolarReddit,f6uinv1,t3_dt1ykp,1573163450.0,I didn’t like Daylio too much and have tried a number of apps. My favourite that I’ve been using for months now is Moodpath. It’s more geared towards depression but definitely can be used for seeing your highs/patterns in mood as well. I love the layout and the way you can see the general trend of your moods over a long term.

But I absolutely love them together as TMG. The music they make that’s like kinda-serious-but-not-really is so good and their chemistry is really what makes it. Like for example the song Knock it Off is good on its own but then when Noel appears at the end it just feels so much more ~complete~"

bipolar2,f2k95cu,t3_ddai7u,1570282795.0,"There’s a specific diagnostic criteria for BPD so while you may relate to having a FP, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have borderline. 

Another thing is that these things were created arbitrarily, so they exist on a spectrum and manifest differently in every person. It’s really difficult to diagnose, especially because a lot of the overlap between them and how difficult it is to self evaluate your symptoms. 

You can also experience symptoms of BPD without actually being diagnosed with the disorder, it’s called having BPD traits.  

It’s tough and confusing, but I would definitely say find out what symptoms are the most prominent and interfere most with your daily life. 

A lot of mental health treatment is trial and error, so work together with yourself and your mental health workers to try and find out how to best tackle your symptoms."
