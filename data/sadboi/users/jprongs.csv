apexlegends,fn365pg,t1_fn33t5o,1586613812.0,Persona 5 Royal!
apexlegends,fem40c6,t1_felyrka,1579239001.0,Doesnâ€™t count for the mode because itâ€™s easy to get more damage and kills.
apexlegends,fem3936,t1_fela9ie,1579238298.0,No. Also the game in general doesnâ€™t work for me.
apexlegends,fehu2xi,t1_fehtg6e,1579123884.0,Me! It doesnâ€™t show up the event neither the challenges for it
bipolar,fa72rr5,t3_e7wl9g,1575830830.0,Not in my opinion because I think she said that the album was made while she was manic not as a way of glorifying it
apexlegends,f5alxt7,t1_f5al3x6,1572109908.0,Maybe they thought you were a good teammate and they want you to be in their team again.
bipolar,f4iqp0i,t3_dkni9r,1571608082.0,"Reread this like 5 times and I keep rereading, the way you write is hypnotic and I love it!"
bipolar,f4im2j8,t3_dko1b8,1571606467.0,"Very inspiring, also the tree is so pretty"
bipolar,f46pkzn,t3_djlyyb,1571411836.0,Love it!!
bipolar,f3or3b6,t3_dhku61,1571025855.0,I love it! It gives me hope and the colors make me feel calm!
bipolar,f32p6sb,t3_dfbvhx,1570621255.0,"Thank you so much for sharing your history and your thoughts. I find them inspiring and Iâ€™m happy you found a good partner, found what you need and got yourself into them. So happy for you!"
ShingekiNoKyojin,f2qrn95,t1_f2qcg27,1570365954.0,Two titans are the stump of the tree or at least thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m seeing
ApexLore,f252ppy,t3_dbz8ie,1569964728.0,Is it Bloodhound?
bipolar,eww2qt0,t3_cqekuw,1565819211.0,Congrats!! Iâ€™m so happy for you!!
bipolar,evwq154,t1_evuf5v1,1564870439.0,I donâ€™t know if you know but they are going for the 2-2-2 role so you can try to alternate with other games. I alternate it with Apex Legends thatâ€™s like a more realistic Fornite in my opinion. Also I donâ€™t know if you played the Bioshock series but theyâ€™re very good
bipolar,evud9ao,t3_cl4izx,1564792020.0,Try to switch up Competitive with Quick Play. When you have a bad game in Competitive play Quick Play until you feel yourself going calmer. At least thatâ€™s what I do.
bipolar,etlkrbx,t3_cc7364,1562939084.0,Really cool!!!
bipolar,et63t34,t3_ca3hei,1562502984.0,Iâ€™m happy for you. You deserve it!
GriefSupport,eq1k1ew,t3_bwp8z7,1559711515.0,Thank you. I love this ðŸ˜Š
GriefSupport,eq1jyxp,t3_bwv26w,1559711457.0,"When something like this happens you find out who are and who are not your friends. If you donâ€™t or canâ€™t stop the friendship I recommend talk less to them, only whatâ€™s enough. Donâ€™t hang out as much as you did back then and then work on yourself. I recommend therapy to work on your emotions and your feelings to the situation. I hope things get better for you!"
GriefSupport,eq1jhkb,t3_bwuxey,1559711077.0,Iâ€™ve never been to one but as far as I know they donâ€™t force you to talk. They give you the choice to talk or to pass.
bipolar,eq1buow,t3_bwwnjr,1559705568.0,Congratulations! You deserve it ðŸ’˜
GriefSupport,eoon37s,t3_bsnopw,1558742707.0,"I would tell your mom. Tell her youâ€™re worried that she may take advantage of her that way youâ€™re not telling her what to do but to be careful and sheâ€™ll see what sheâ€™ll do. So sorry that youâ€™re going through this. My aunt did the same thing but with my fathers stuff. Itâ€™s okay youâ€™re angry, you feel like you need to protect your mom and thatâ€™s very noble of you. I hope things work out well for you!"
GriefSupport,eok5rdb,t3_bs4um0,1558647541.0,"You never really close the chapter. With time, it gets a little easier but the chapter is still there. Stick to your family and rely in each other."
GriefSupport,eok4583,t3_bs6x6b,1558646888.0,"My condolences to your family. I would ask lawyers if you and your mom can do anything legal to the carers because thatâ€™s a medical negligence. Donâ€™t blame yourself, you guys did a good thing putting her in the home with your circumstances, the people at fault are the carers. Let yourselves feel the emotions, be there for each other and I would recommend therapy to let yourselves heal. Stay strong."
SuicideWatch,eogkn0c,t3_blfsjb,1558559886.0,"Proud of you, stay strong!"
