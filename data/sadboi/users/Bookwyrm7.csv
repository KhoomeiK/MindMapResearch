comics,fqwziz4,t1_fqwwqcu,1589722100.0,"Men are literally stronger than most women. Full stop. Height isn't all of it. Women have to be more careful than men just because 75% of the world is stronger than them. And then we add in the height factor later, which being big and bulky is intimidating, even if they don't do anything about that implied strength.

Men on the other hand, don't really need to fear being overpowered by a woman, or even other men nearly as much. Height and bulk is the main way men intimidate each other by, but the knowledge is there that you have a chance to take them and win if all is fair.

Women don't have that. The skills to alert of danger aren't as honed in men normally, because they don't need to be. You know those movies where people get shrunk and realise they actually have to fear things they wouldn't normally? Women are taught that from childhood. It's then reinforced over and over by the stories we hear or read far too often. Men are taught to project strength, to stand up for themselves.

That is why women should be more on edge, because there is more out there that has the potential to abuse/kill/harass them day to day, and they know it. Until men get that lesson taught to them, the thought doesn't often cross men's minds the scale of living like that every single day. And that's not just in the USA, that's pretty much every country in the world"

You're not fighting with yourself anymore, your riding the waves instead of crashing into them.

It's not always easy, it doesn't always work perfectly, but it does help. I'm hoping even if you do know, others might be able to benefit from speaking up in the hopes i could help you, even a little. And I truly, utterly hope things improve again for you."

Good people can lash out and hurt, but they tend to apologise later for their words, not dig in deeper over time. It seems from what we see here, he would rather not see himself as in the wrong for that argument, and likely isn't willing to see any of his barbed comments for what they are.

So to answer each question as they are, not over reacting, you can work on yourself if you want, but don't feel you need to forgive more than you are willing to forgive, they don't feel like excuses, more that you don't want to leave out information that might change the answer, and I wouldn't say trying to show a united front with your husband is stepping out of your lane."

Now think on the amount of information that is new on the topic of sex education in the last decade alone, concerning gay acceptance, or gender expression, protection, consent, and so much more. Its out there, but when you have people actively trying to trip you up on these things, how do you expect people to know what is right?

todayilearned,fmom7r5,t1_fmogtak,1586263224.0,"It says over 1700 words. But he did things that we for sure do now as a result of him. Tenses of words, uses of nouns as verbs, verbs as adjectives, adding prefixes or suffixes. It might explain why some words follow one rule, then you have others that just seem broken. The use of turns of phrase too... I'm glad we have a rich source of language as a result of him.

I have heard some words were also documenting word that the people around him said, but the richer folk didn't use as much/ever, but I'm not sure of the truth of that."

aspergers,fmfjtgv,t1_fmeki5h,1586028742.0,"The books that changed my views on positivity were fiction believe it or not. Traci Harding writes time travel mostly, but it is weaved with spirituality (not religious). One of the big messages is mind over matter. Sure we can't read minds or time travel or teleport, but thinking about a more positive outcome does allow us to see the possibility of that happening, just like thinking the worst has us seeing the worst. They aren't perfect books, but I relate better to fiction than non fiction, and found that I could pull a lot of information that way. If that style of learning works for you, maybe give it a go?"

TwoXChromosomes,fm8n8y8,t1_fm882fy,1585852455.0,"I love living in New Zealand for that. No weird touching, or hugging, or kissing. I loathe being touched so much, I avoided so much crap because I grew up here. I do love the hongi* at appropriate times though, because I've only ever done it as a sign of respect, and I can get behind that.

*Hongi is when you (gently) press foreheads and noses together, and breathe the same air as each other for a brief moment. Often accompanied by hand shaking or forearm clasping
