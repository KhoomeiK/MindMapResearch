If you want to stick to shrooms, it's part of the ticket. Sometimes you have a trip where you don't feel a bit nauseated and sometimes you are puking in streams. If you didn't know that, you might do a bit more research on the substances. Could be that you missed something else.

I didn't know that about the klein bottle. But yeah you have a point and I understand the problem. So it's similar like with our lil tesseract: All we can do is make 3d ""shadows""  of it. Thanks for the refresher on that part.

&#x200B;

I took my fair share to study this answer. So just to get it straight, you meant timespace in a 3d manner and said, that 4D spacetime would be unpercievable of room. Experiencing everything at once. What is even perception, or causality if everything happens at once? Nature doesn't care whether we understand it or not.. but how could I percieve an unpercievable world? Math is definetly a good start. We have already some measures to ""visialize"" 4d.. maybe with the works of neurology and the game industry, we could even ""make"" the brain percieve a tesseract.

&#x200B;

I thought you meant a ""place"" outside of the dimensions. Like omega shall be the ""number"" after infinity and that, even though there are infinie numbers even more, you can categorize it in even ""more"" infinite infinities.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph\_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number). Like if try to find the limit of the dimensions and read the value of it.

oh dear.. picking favorites is quite hard. I'm a guy with too many interests, and so are my role models,too:  
Da Vinci, Tesla, Einstein, Hawkins, Gallilei. Some may do science without belief but I and Immanuel Kant. Interesting.. I used the Feynman's method without knowing it. All I may add is: If there are things you have to remember. Make a play out of it.. don't take it seriously, if you entertain yourself, you learn faster.  


One belief, which seems to be strange to some is the belief, that science is just a belief, too. The best tested, formulated and accepted on the whole world, but If the earth didn't fold into a sphere from the midages to modern times, we always see in my opinion what I meant. Here in Germany Physical and Metaphysical rules aren't really tested anymore. Reality is what you see, or scientist say. 

Christianity has its ten commandmends and should be in my opinion more understood as a moral compass, which should be interpreted into modern times, while science has its axioms which should be interpreted into modern times.  
If, however ar parts of it, be it Christianity or Science, it shall be changed. Made me quite some hassle. But as I am telling everyone, who wants to hear it:  


I'm a effing peacock! I polarize.  


that answer to this would be:  


I'm a effing lion. I rule.

What you hear in my opinion is the world screaming for help. Reading people and know them by their face.. sometimes even their aura was quite depressing at start. All those serious faces... and their fear of abandonment. The book I am reading even is talking about a ""Borderline society"" , with Borderline as in BPD.

Most people I met are indoctrinated into this type of craze that ""just this one thing will solve everything.. and then I will be happy"". They archieve it.. they long for the feeling. They don't get it (in both meanings, hah!) and they long for the next thing... and then they will be happy. Hah.. I love people, but I hate society.

Define risky. It's a type thing with those psychedelics. I made once the bold hyptothesis, that I can't have a bad trip anymore (at least in moderate doses). This hypothesis holds since 1 whole year tripping. It may induce psychosis, but as I perceive mental illnesses it't more like a really nasty bad habit than a one way road. I made myself trust again by facing my broken trust until I was fed up and ""just"" changed it. Basically I made some psychological intended pitfalls, so that my BPD is tricked into actually helping my mental health, rather than destroying it. Only downside is if you lose hope, everything will turn against you and you will have a hard time on regaining your own trust.

It's a lot about training yourself to accept uncertainty. The biggest fear of a BPD. With this I ""cured"" my BPD.

Fun thing is, that I didn't knew that I had BPD until the point I almost got over it anyway.

tl;dr A mental illness is in my opinion not the final destination. A psychosis or BPD is merely a transformation state to self improvement, if treated correctly.

A crazy person who may act normal owns the world after all."
Borderline,ff14v1t,t3_eq2gcd,1579475201.0,"Narcissism is a trait which a borderliner may, or may not have. Think of a borderliner more of a guy who looks at the cabinet of mental disorders and wants its cut of every one of them. Schizophrenia, Bipolarity, Narcissism. Borderliner just can't say no. It's fun."
Borderline,ff12k4w,t3_eqtr1l,1579474604.0,"Most importantly, this is unfortunately normal with BPD. On the bright side there is hope. But it's a marathon, where you have to be prepared.

First off I am sorry to say, but you seem to be quite shaken up yourself. Try to refocus, consider therapy and meditation as this will help you focus and ""see"" ways out of this mess. Consider joining a self help group of BPD relatives. I know it is really, really hard, but with BPD it is essential, that you put your mental health before everything else. Offsprings of BPDs have a higher chance of developing BPD themselves when they grow older. You cannot help, when you are depressed after all.

To your mother applies the same: If she isn't yet in therapy she should definitely, as BPD is best treated in therapy, not medication. Make sure, that she can trust the therapist, as trust is essential in battling this sickness. She should also consider meditation or yoga, as this is proven to reduce the intensity of psychotic episodes.

If the medication has such strong side-effects, she should talk with her doctor. There is more than one medication for BPD. Please keep in mind that most BPDs are pathological liars as with their broken trust. Don't get me wrong.. we are not evil.. we are just.. complicated.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

You are not alone

&#x200B;

Just treat your mother as she is not going mad. Maybe explain, that this is only a mismatch in brain chemistry and with due training can be rearranged so it makes at least less damage for them or others.

Always remember the human behind the sickness, but try to separate it from your fears. Just do what you can, not what you expect of you to ""succeed"" to rescue your mother.

I have BPD myself and all I can say is that my friends should always put their mental health first, as if they are weak, my fear of rejection will find it and use it against them. Start a gratitude diary for example. An app like presently for android could help to remind yourself of the small things you are grateful for.

For the rest: Think of a borderliner as a big child. If you think ""child"" you can help fiddle out those weird, nasty self loathing, thoughts some may have.

All the best luck

psychonauts,ff0ttae,t1_ff0hsv8,1579472233.0,"Your death would've been quite tragic, as you are a real interesting talking buddy. Call me naive, but ""aligning of the timelines"" sounds quite nice but a can't really get a grasp on what you really meant.

Basically the same thought, but another viewpoint would be that every action is happening in the same moment and through the configuration of the energetic levels of the elements or mass placement one of the actions manifest in ""our"" reality.  One step further would be to think if you can do it the other way around. With thought changing reality itself. Naively thinking you already do it no questions asked. But could you bend some scientific ""constants"" to you pleasing? What would then happen if a group, or say humanity agrees on a new ""rule"" or the cancelling of an old rule.

Basically transcending humanity into a godlike state though mutual understanding."

Fun thing is, while enduring what made me panic i learned what more real happiness is. With some episodes that I am crazy after all. But hey.. 

Can't wait to trip again.. I hate routine. Funny thing is that I tricked myself into doing routines to happiness. The psyche is a strange, strange place. It gave me my spirituality back, which I now lost again, but slowly regaining it.

Can't wait to study psychology. :)"
psychonauts,ff0irl1,t1_ff04c5c,1579469234.0,"Identity was always fascinating to me. Yes we define us as a human being. But this is just a bunch of cells put together. The definition of the me.. what is me.. how much can the ""me"" change so it is still perceived as willingly.

Long story short: I didn't find a border where there was a me. I had to define it totally arbitrary. Slowly realizing, that you may influence every thought, every decision and every task you do. It should be obvious, that you can influence your doings, but doing it in a way to perceive yourself as the best version as you are, is still something different."

psychonauts,ff0h1dp,t1_fezxobk,1579468821.0,"Well there are theories which supports your belief. There are those who say, that time is just perceived but everything happens at once. Fun thing is about this ""at once"" this is also a time. This must be something even more weird. A dimension where ""now"" or ""this noon"" inst distinguishable anymore. What a strange world it would be."
MentalHealthSupport,fezmlam,t1_fezcccl,1579459039.0,Belief is a very sensible topic. I understand. Have a nice day.
MentalHealthSupport,fez5f27,t1_fez4jcj,1579453988.0,"Ah yeah.. and if you believe in spirituality or not.. a sense of purpose, that there is a reason that you have these visions oftentimes helps enduring the event itself. fun thing is: Everything is really happening for a reason. Be it chemicals or spirit. Stick to a hobby and find beauty in the small things again."
MentalHealthSupport,fez4jcj,t1_fez1a21,1579453779.0,"Really nice that you checked beforehand.  I would really try to convince to check more with the psychosis. The psyche is a dirty place, normally they don't care about norms. The thing is, that you may identify a trigger which induces those psychotic episodes. Avoid if possible this trigger and with your therapist slowly confront those triggers. I wish you the very best. Feel free to message me, if you have any further questions and do tell when you get new intel on your state. What I liked to hear when I had those vivid panic attacks was: You are not going crazy, your mind is just working a bit different. The mind can adapt. You may not stop those visions, but you may change how you perceive those episodes. Consider Meditation and Yoga, as this will further calm your mind, helping you to find ways otherwise hidden.

All the love

It's not the end of the world, you are not more or less crazy than the others. Your mind is just working a bit differently than a normal brain. Ins't this awesome btw?

What always helps is introspection and self-awareness trainings like meditation or yoga.

**PLEASE** do not understand this as a diagnosis. Understand this more like a subject you may bring up, when talking with a therapist again."
