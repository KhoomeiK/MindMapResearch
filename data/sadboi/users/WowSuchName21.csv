csgo,fqtocj3,t1_fqti9j5,1589642902.0,"More smurfs are defo a part of lockdown, but at the same time smurfs can be a good thing to the learning process, I found especially when I first started playing when I played with my other group of friends (who are supreme/globals) I learned very quickly as I was watching players who were much better than me, the same applies with enemy smurfs, a guy is kicking your ass? What exactly is he doing, learn to predict his plays and adapt. Counter strike is a team based game after all, one person cannot solo carry. My personal way of dealing with Smurf’s like I mentioned is to try and rally the team. Say that every round the smurf is making the same play? 

Lets put out a hypothetical and say you are playing a game of mirage and notice one player is doing most of the lifting. Say he is pushing under on mirage to flank whilst the rest of his lower skilled teammates face A site. You all rotate but get flanked, in this situation you would just make sure you stock up on utility and outman him. Smurf’s usually play in a very predictable manner, sure they are out of your rank but the kind of person who plays against lower ranks is usually doing it as they can’t face their own with confidence. They’ll make repetitive plays as it’s what they know, they will peak repetitive angles. Just watch how they play and beating a smurf comes easy, kill them and watch as the round crumbles.  Just my advice anyway."

But yes, since not being able to see my friends due to lockdown measures in my country I started joinin g them in their ranked games. We play a mix of scrimmage but when they want to play comp I do join them. It’s not a horrible carry situation where the enemies can’t do anything, one of them is really sharp aim wise he just can’t teamplay for shit, he comes from other shooters. He outaims me in 1v1s for example. I’m not some crazy aim god either even at that rank, I got my rank from being a pretty calm player that shotcalls for the team. Sure I can play pretty competently but I’d probably put my aim/reflexes more at DMG level. 

Honestly advice I wish I’d given myself when I was younger is to just not be toxic and loud, people will respect you more if you come up with a solution, even if you aren’t doing great in game being the one which gets the team together and puts everybody on the same page is paramount. Getting a team in like and coming up with plays can bring you back from some spiralling losses."

cycling,fpg65xr,t1_fpg5iya,1588595350.0,Madness! Luckily no breakages but I hope the driver gets her license stripped
cycling,fpg64ej,t1_fpg517e,1588595316.0,Was my first thought but all she could worry about was her bike (understandably so it’s an absolute beauty!) I hope she gets her license stripped!
cycling,fpg4igj,t1_fpg3wfk,1588594002.0,She’s race insured so it covers it. Yea that’s what we are looking into currently. Just another pain to add to the pile of annoyances at the moment! Thanks for the reply c
cycling,fpg37og,t1_fpg2i6w,1588592861.0,"She’s fine! Was worried about a known health condition being ‘triggered’ without giving away too many details but she was scanned and looked over and it’s fine. I wasn’t out with her as it was a training ride but it happened 15 mins away from the house, I ran down instantly and the paramedics had already arrived. 

The woman who hit her looked suspicious as fuck (there was more of a look of ‘im fucked’ than ‘is this woman I’ve just hit okay’) I was instantly saying how we need to involve the police as did the paramedics, police arrived. Had a chat with both parties, my fiancé didn’t want to press charges just wants her bike sorted so she can continue training. Then the officer (who was luckily a cyclist, so didn’t get any car biases) realised the woman was uninsured, her tone quickly changed and started going off on one. 

She was driving her fathers motibiliy vehicle (car for disabled provided in finance at a discounted rate) and was using it to travel to work (also against rules of these vehicles.) this was the extra kick in the face for her as my fiancé had recently had her car taken away from her as allegedly ‘isn’t disabled enough’ (paraphrasing obvs.) I really hope she gets her license stripped, scumbag. 

My fiancé has already put a claim in with British cycling, her coaches partner who works in claims says this kinda thing can take a while anyway let alone with covid so we realistically just want to sort this ASAP and get a new bike for her to train on."

pcmasterrace,fpg0ojq,t1_fpfzkm7,1588590491.0,"Never used them before but they seem fine usually, to be fair msi naming two different cars ‘seahawk x’ and ‘Seahawk EK x’ has probably lead to this situation before"
pcmasterrace,fpg0mh9,t1_fpg0ik7,1588590434.0,"Thanks for your wise words, stay safe and stay strong x"
pcmasterrace,fpg0d0f,t3_gd8l6v,1588590173.0,Update: both cards are now marked end of the line. Spoke to somebody who’s going to put me through to a marketing manager but I don’t thing this is gonna end with me getting the card I ordered.
pcmasterrace,fpfzoix,t1_fpfzk6s,1588589485.0,It’s now marked as End of the line on their site so I think they are just gonna tell me to deal with it. Don’t think I’m getting a Seahawk anytime soon
pcmasterrace,fpfy7xu,t1_fpfxwom,1588587980.0,"Yep it is, I try and remember that all the time and I am by no means discounting anybody else’s situation.  Thanks for the grounding, think I needed that."
