They can take a toll on our mental stability. I have had depression since i can remember. It doesn’t go away unfortunately and shows no mercy. But we can get through it
Thetruthishere,fqs94u8,t1_fqs49al,1589601326.0,"I think the emotionless factor can be attributed separately meaning the two don’t go hand in hand; having trouble feeling empathy or emotions can be attributed to sociopaths or could be a symptom of another untreated mental illness. Having trouble with emotions could also be from other trauma whether it’s childhood or adult, psychological or physical or even sexual i think trauma can definitely affect those things. The brain is super complex and there is no one explanation that fits all. If that makes sense"

EDIT: more thoughts - that feeling of being slimy and dirty is totally valid and totally a normal feeling BUT try to accept that you are not that it is just a feeling because what happened to you IS dirty and fucking slimy but the person who did that horrendous thing should feel dirty and slimy and like a piece of human toxic waste who will rot in hell and let’s be real probably doesn’t because they are obviously not decent in any way. Maybe the world is a weird place full of energy and that slimy energy is put on you because the asshole who deserves it can so easily shake it off. You’re a fighter and you can beat that inner voice telling you that you’re not worth it. You’re SO SO worth it and deserve only good things.

Take aptitude tests or 16 personalities has a good quick assessment. Then - and this sucks- but be super thorough on your resume and cover letter and literally customize it to each job. I worked for AmeriCorps for my first year after college. It’s hard and the pay is shit but it looks good on a resume and you get an education award for your service if you complete the one year. I paid off my loans with that money it was only 6k but it helped. I now work for the American Diabetes Association and i love my job. good luck!!!! Hang in there!!
