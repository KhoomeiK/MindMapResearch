EatingDisorderHope,figm19v,t3_f7xrjm,1582401220.0,"I really need to share my story about my eating disorder. It all started when I what’s little, I was 8 years old, and my family broke up. I was so shocked, so scared, but I couldn’t tell anyone. My mum was abusive and talking with her was impossible. I became extremely insecure, and my eating disorder started. I started to eat too much, and I did it for years. I remember my first diet, I hate it because it was too restrictive for a 12 year old girl. Diets and diets during all my puberty and adolescence. My family didn’t helped, I felt like I was a fool. Anything was ok, I was not ok. Too fat, always too fat. “Oh, I wish to see you thinner”, “you’re too fat”, “you’re not like this”. I lived like this for years.  I wished that I was vanished, dead. But now, in this moment, I’m recovering since 2016 and I’m hospitalised since November 2019! I’m blooming like a beautiful flower..."
