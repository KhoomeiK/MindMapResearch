Rochester,f2lgxjs,t3_ddmt83,1570294825.0,"Whether or not you need a static IP address depends on how easily you need to get into your own network remotely.

Most of the devices/services mentioned are all outbound connections to the service provider (Amazon/Google/Microsoft/IoT) - client-based devices - Getting out isn't the issue.

I can access my home network remotely using a number of different methods by allowing ports through my firewall/port forwarding. Typically we're all using NAT which itself does not allow any inbound traffic, all unsolicited traffic is dropped by default.  Using port forwarding allows for an inbound connection to come through to the device/service you configured. Services on my home network that I access remotely: VPN, SSH, RDP, HTTPS

DHCP with Spectrum works just fine as the IP address assigned to my router hasn't changed. I also use Dynamic DNS so that I can have a domain name associated to my Internet IP address. Most routers will have this ability. This will help for the rare times the DHCP assigned address actually changes. A DHCP assigned address will definitely change anytime the router's hardware is changed.

Some Internet Service Providers are now using NAT to provide an IP address which means there would be a double-NAT situation. Here is where getting into the home network would be impossible without a cloud service to proxy the communications.

In short, do you need to get into your home network?"
