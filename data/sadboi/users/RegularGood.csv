mentalhealth,fmxg8hk,t3_fx2qdr,1586464411.0,"I LOVE and flourish at both of my jobs and can't wait to get back to them when things settle down, but when things got shut down it felt like a load off my shoulders; a break to catch my breath a bit. Even though I'm an extrovert, the idea of staying at home for a bit seemed like a vacation, but without the annoying bits of going through an airport or finding someone to watch the dogs.

My partner wasn't affected by the transition to work from home, so they're still working a regular 9-5 schedule. So worrying about how we're going to pay the mortgage or buy groceries is thankfully not something that I worry about. 

At the start I was crazy productive doing things around that house that I have been meaning to do for ages, started a garden, sanded and restained the outdoor furniture, cleaned the garage... so many things. That was Mid-March?

Now, I'm still forcing myself to do things. Cook dinner, clean the house, make the bed, laundry, mow the yard/misc. yard work, all necessary errands (grocery shopping, picking up dog's medications, etc.) but I'm crying at the drop of a hat. I feel so overwhelmed and drowning, but I don't know what I'm drowning in, if that makes sense.

So, to be honest, I'm not sure how I'm doing. I thought I was doing okay, but now I don't know. I come from a long history of depression and the past few years, after I quit a terrible career and transitioned into a 180\* opposite career, have been the most stable, happy, and optimistic I've been since I was 14? And I'm now in my mid-30s. 

It's like a weird Groundhog day with only the weather that changes."

And all I can remember was that it was massive and you could type, ""go east"" and you would move one room to the east. There were a ton of secret rooms/passages you could only get to if you knew the secret commands. 

Lots of colored fonts, lots of weird emotes, lots of rooms."

AskWomenOver30,ewczrda,t1_ewcwb74,1565292834.0,"Exactly. Once I moved out, married, bought a house, some of my Dad's frustrations about home-life (which my Mom took as hating us) make a lot more sense and I find myself having the same frustrations. Not because of ""the wife and kids"" but because being an adult is rough. Luckily, I have an awesome partner who truly is my partner and the burden of adulthood is shared. My father never had that outlet/support with my Mom, so him being as gracious and understanding of a Father makes me appreciate him even more."
AskWomenOver30,ewcm6if,t3_cnm5gj,1565287022.0,"Wow... kind of a complicated question. My Dad was incredibly involved with my childhood: softball coach, science fair helper, drove me to school on his way to work, sat patiently with me for hours when I couldn't understand 8th grade science, went above and beyond on all aspects of my life; all around outstanding Dad.

My mother suffers from untreated bipolar, ADHD, narcissistic personality disorder and has spent my entire life mentally unstable (ranging from a little out of it to inpatient treatment). So when she accused my Dad of molesting me (10000% DID NOT HAPPEN) in 3rd grade, his and my relationship got destroyed (partially by a court-order, but mostly because of my mother). We (my Mom, brother, and I) moved out of the house and she started (and honestly hasn't stopped) filling my head with all these terrible things that my Dad had done. She told me about her failed marriage, how much she hated my Dad, how he ruined her life, etc.... all that BS from 3rd Grade until I was a Senior in Highschool. Mind you, my parents aren't divorced and after an extended inpatient treatment after the ""incident"" we all moved back in together, so I had to live with this ""uncaring, emotionally abusive, unloving, manipulative asshole"" for most of my childhood. 

It wasn't until I left for college that I realized that the person who my mother painted as all those negative things, was none of those and I put a solid effort into reestablishing a good relationship with him. Now he's one of my best friends, I talk to him every day, and he is not only a good, patient man, but a good father. And hell, even a good husband to someone who has tested his marriage vows.

So to all those fathers, if your relationship with your children isn't where you want it to be, hold on. The patience and devotion that he's shown to my Mother is something that I think about every day. Sometimes I wish they would have gotten a divorce, because as his daughter, I want him to be happy and in an equally loving, caring, relationship with someone who views him as the amazing man he is.

Fathers, wait until your kids are adults and make a point to reconnect. People change, grow, and thrive in different environments, maybe once the kids are out of the house, you can view each other in a different light."
