JudgeMyAccent,fqxfjne,t1_fqxc16n,1589731506.0,"Sorry, I meant close-mid back vowel like the ""o"" in ""over"" 

Try looking up IPA transcriptions of words to get a better understanding of their vowels. There are words that sound different from their spellings. Look up words on online dictionaries and listen to how they are pronounced (ofc, there are variations, but you get the general idea). 

For pot /pɑt/: the /ɑ/ here sounds like the /ɑ/ in ""art"". This word usually required you to fully open your mouth. 

This as opposed to /kloʊz/ for ""close"" where your mouth forms an ""o"" shape. The difference between this ""o"" to the ""o"" in ""over"" is that when saying ""close"", the ""o"" sound kinda sounds like an ""uh"". 

Here's my tip: practice your vowels by knowing which sounds come from which part of your mouth, it really helps!

I hope this cleared things up for you!"
JudgeMyAccent,fqxbduw,t3_glfwc9,1589729385.0,"1 and 2

I'm gonna go on a limb here and guess that you might be a Spanish speaker? Or somewhere of Latin influence. 

I've noticed that your vowels tend to shift from a close-mid back vowel (o) to a closed back vowel (u). I mean, it's not a dead giveaway because your English pronunciation is pretty good! However your tongue could be heavily relying on your base language/ L1 which is why your vowels tend to shift."

Be a good listener. If he keeps on stopping midway the conversation, let him. Give a small smile and tell him it's fine to take his time. If you feel like it's taking him too long, he could be uncomfortable with it. Apologize if you made him uncomfortable and change the topic.

relationship_advice,fmyxed0,t3_fxs0hs,1586498772.0,"As someone on the other end (falsely accused) this whole story makes me angry so I'm going to be heavily biased here, take this with a grain of salt. 

Your friend is crying, from what? From not believing him? From losing him? Or is it because she destroyed her own relationship by believing other people and not consulting him first?

Either way, take responsibility for your actions. For her to get over this, she needs to understand how to discern gossips from the facts, and accountability.

1. Leave the relationship to both of them, stay out of it. Don't apologize or try to contact the ex on her behalf. 


2. This is a situation where you can't do anything to make her feel better. Let her cry, it will pass. 


3. Don't bother the ex-boyfriend. Let things calm down for a while. Let your friend and the ex heal. The ex obviously did not want to be contacted; let him have his solace, it's the least you can do for him. 


4. After things have calmed down, simply apologize to the ex. You should all do that. 
You collectively tarnished his name, ignored him and cut him off. Get all the people involed to apologize. Don't ask to be forgiven.
 Tell your friend to not twist the apology into ""I said I'm sorry so can we go back to being a thing bc I'm hurt too"". He is the main victim here, don't dare to pressure him into something to make your friend feel better. I'm leaning into a public apology because what he went through was a public embarrassment... but you decide. 


5. Related to number 4, don't apologize if you are not ready for it. With emotions high, it could easily turn into a blaming game. Don't force the apology, it won't mean anything. And more importantly: don't apologize just to make yourselves feel better. 


I apologize if this sounds like I'm attacking you. It is what it is. This is a time for reevaluation, pick the people you trust. I know that as the friend you want to help her and I wish you well during this time, but this is something she has to get over on her own. This started because she listened to other people a lot, she needs to listen to herself."
relationship_advice,fmyuqb8,t1_fmy3g6h,1586496349.0,"The point here is not how they acted before the break up, being lovey dovey and all that. The point here is that your friend fucked up and the boyfriend is the victim of a witch hunt. 

Just imagine the pain the *ex-boyfriend* went through. Her crying for a week is sad, we get that, but what about the ex-boyfriend? Is he still mentally okay after being falsely accused? 

I know you only speak for your friend but unfortunately you also need to see how she and the friend group fucked up. Take accountability for your actions. In this scenario, even if she was pressured, she's not the victim here.

mentalhealth,fmsyfju,t1_fmsty7h,1586363959.0,"Yeah, I agree. Suicide is different because of the stigma surrounding it; victim blaming, pushing the guilt to the other person, the sense of helplessness--""why didn't I notice it sooner?"", and many more reasons but  I try to see it as the bottomline: a cause of death. Seeing it this way helps me to understand that it wasn't the person who was the direct cause but an illness, or some outside force/influence. ""They took their own life"" yeah I hear this a lot, but did they really? They took it, sure, but what lead up to it? Surely people don't just randomly want to end their life one day for no reason at all.

This question threw me in for a loop when I found out that there wasn't a word for ""rape"" in one of the indigenous languages in Southeast Asia. The main narrative was because the word did not exist, they didnt have the concept of it. There were studies done based on this idea and found out that there weren't rape cases in that particular community. After looking at this again from the saussurean perspective, things kinda made sense.

Banned us from going to school for 2 weeks and still uncertain if we are able to go back. A few of my friends made the call not to come home, not only for their (old) parents but for their sake too. 

We recently had a case where a man who was under investigation went around town and travelled around the country. He knew he could possibly have the virus but went ahead and travelled around anyway. Turns out he was indeed, positive for the coronavirus. God knows how many people he had infected, and how many of those know that they were in contact with an infected person. Staying where you are now might be the safest option IMO."
relationship_advice,fkjttl0,t3_fiu10l,1584259370.0,"I don't think anyone of you is being unreasonable. You are both scared, that's a given. Try to think of it this way: you go out, you travel, mingle with people. You may or may not have increased your chances of being infected. I can't give you an answer but I advise you to think about your chances of being infected by traveling. Are there cases in your state?

My friends have travelled to their family homes for quarantine, have they been advised by their parents not to come home? No. They were advised to come home so they can look after each other. They took precautionary measures before they came home, travelled in a private cars or isolated flights. Avoided all contact with their parents, kept a mask on and sanitized everything they touched. 

On the other hand, I had friends who choose to stay. Stayed in their cramped dorms with shitty internet, or -luckily- two-bedroom apartments. They took it upon themselves not to travel. They said that with the school closed for some weeks, a lot of students and people might be travelling to their respective homes--which means a higher risk of being infected. The long lines, cramped spaces and uncertainty of people who might be infected that they come in contact with deterred them from going home. They said that they did not want to catch the virus from travelling and bring it to their homes. The primary victims are generally old people or those who have a history of illnesses that render them with low immune system. 

Talk with your roomate. These are scary times and the only way about it is to be cautious. Try not to panic and ask them if they can stop having visitors around. If they say no, take it upon yourself to sanitize things that people often touch and avoid minimal contact with them. As far as I know, the virus is not air borne. Maintain social distance and keep yourself and your space clean. As for the roomate, enourage them to clean up--this is for their sake too. Offer to help them clean, this could motivate them to get up their ass. If they say no, then keep a division of space. Also, does your roomate often go out? 

Keep your head up. Maintain basic hygiene and avoid crowds. Did you explain to your father your reason for coming home? Are there any other relatives you can come home to? Friends who did not go home to their families?"
