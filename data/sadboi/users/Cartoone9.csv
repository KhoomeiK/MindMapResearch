At the end of the day I didn’t expected any help or anything from others in cheating, I knew it wasn’t fair to them on the ranking system. 
I wanted good grades so people would get off my back, but in the long run I was only hurting myself, I didn’t go to the same college or studies they did or could, I didn’t had the thrive to learn anymore because I gave up already in high school. In the end all I expected from the working kids was not to snitch, because now your going against me and not for yourself."

I had something a bit similar happening to me. So I lost my 2 grand fathers, 1 of them I never met, the other one I only remember from when I was little, both died of cancer. 

I took the habit when I was younger to talk to him whenever things were hard, like talking to my guardian angel. I figured if someone was looking out for me it would probably be him. 

One night when I was 16/17 I was going through some difficulties at home and at school, I was looking out at my window, watching the night sky and the stars, talking to him saying things like “yeah it’s hard but I’m gonna be ok don’t worry, I’ll try to make it easier on mom” etc etc... and I was pretty sad but still keeping hope while I was talking to him. At some point I received a drop on the forehead, a single one. I was really surprised and watched around if clouds were gathering or if some water was coming down from the roof, but nothing at all.

I think god needs us to do so. It’s important that you have free will to kill for exemple : if you choose not to do it, you’re a good person because you could but didn’t. But if you had no possibility to kill whatsoever, how could you be a good person because of that ? You had no opportunity, even if you wanted you couldn’t. What’s brave in that ?

There has to be pain and mistakes and crimes, because when you chose not to go that path it makes you a better person. But it has to come from you, not because you were obligated. Even by a holy book. 

Whenever you do something good, I think it lose valor if you do it « only to get to paradise ».

And I also think love is one of the few things god gave us to relieve our pains. I can’t see him/her judge you because you did the very thing love was intended to. I’m not telling you Kim kardashian should be an exemple. But I think you should be able to experience love without having to commit for life.

Our country is currently burning from the inside because we make a lot of money but never see the color of it. In fact we have good welfare state but our president (Macron) is trying to sell it to private investors, mostly friends of his. 

The worst is not that the state is doing shit, president over the years have been doing that, French people go on strike, then we get a bit, and get back to work, etc etc always worked somehow like that. But with this regime the only response has been violence and hypocrisy. 
They do shit, act like they own France when they’re suppose to represent the will of the people, then hide behind cops (said cops with orders to go violent in order to break the strikes with fear).
The worst is seeing our president « teaching » other countries, like Great Britain recently. This guy is the worst joke I’ve ever seen, the only good thing about it is people from abroad don’t really know about him so they don’t care, but if they did they will see in him every fucking cliché that has ever been said about french people. 

To resume, the system works, the taxes are okay because of the infrastructures we have, but we’re currently fighting to keep all of that because it might disappear soon with our actual president.

Don’t overreact, you are young and our modern society is well made, most of your mistakes won’t have any impact on your life growing up except for teaching you things so don’t be afraid to fail. That’s how you learn and grow the fastest. 

Don’t think too much about girls and relationship, it’s nice to have someone in your life but truth is it doesn’t matter that much, even at my age relationships don’t mean a lot for people. Focus on yourself and your own growth, one day you’ll be the cool dude you wish can be, and a nice lady will come your way and it will just click. 

Your first real breakup is gonna suck a lot, but remember we all went trough it because in the end like I said, it doesn’t matter that much. 
The first breakup is the one that will help you deal with all the others that might come up after. At least it was the case for me, and from this failure I learned so much about who I am and what I need in life. Don’t be afraid of failing, keep trying things until it works. 

Same for school, at 14 you might feel like only school and studies will get you somewhere in life but honestly it’s just partly true. College is just a way to win some time and get to a job faster, but it doesn’t mean that if you don’t go trough college you won’t do shit. Some people studied law all their life and ended up working in finance, some people studied art and ended up in the military... there is a lot of paths my friend, because you don’t take one doesn’t mean you can’t end up in the same place. Sometime it will just take some more time and/or effort. 

My final advice would be to love yourself. 
Give yourself some time to figure things out, forgive your mistakes, keep going forward."

When you discover someone and start to really like him/her you might feel the need to show it, because why not ? You’re a nice person and you want your crush to feel nice ... but really the more independant you are, the more you’ll get their attention. Show interest of course but never too much, never in the beginning.
If your time has no value and they can get to you whenever they want, then why should they value you?
Again I’m no expert, take it or leave it that’s my advice !"

AskMen,fgfixxg,t3_ey7i7l,1580740015.0,"I don’t think I like myself in the sense that I don’t feel like someone should love me or be in a relationship with me. I genuinely think I’m not the right person for that, at least now, and I need to work on myself to get to that someday. 
I don’t hate myself, not always, but sometimes I really wish I was someone else with more control and discipline.
In the end I think I’m a good guy, at least someone who tries, but I don’t really appreciate who I am. 

I’m curious now : why the question? :)"
