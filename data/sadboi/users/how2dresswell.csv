OccupationalTherapy,fqwpq2z,t3_glcwcu,1589713342.0,"Some of the best discussions I've had with patients is during task-based activities. You can still spark meaningful discussion for sure. Patients are often more comfortable in this environment  (feel less pressured, hands are busy), and might open up even more than in a discussion group. You could also ask to sit-in on some of the more discussion-based groups, and eventually offer some ideas of group topics, offer to run them yourself. A lot of times in this setting, the department wants to see how the new employee interacts with the patient and can use therapeutic-use-of-self. Can you re-direct the inappropriate patients, can you challenge the difficult patient, etc. If you have these good skills, I'm sure they would let you run your own discussion groups down the road.

Also, I would not recommend sharing your own mental health history with the patients. Unless of course your supervisor said this is okay."

immediately after my level 2 fieldwork ended, i took 4-5 weeks to study for the NBCOT . took the test and went to spain with my fam. found out there that i passed! when i got back, my bf and i took a 3 month cross country road trip. he waited until the trip was over to study for the NBCOT. i was happy that i got mine outta the way. when we got back home, it took me about 3 months to get a job (he got a job at his old l2 fw right away, #malepriviledge) .

you can make it work. i highly recommend it. it's definitely harder to leave a full time job to travel. do it while you're young and you have no commitments lmfao

the travel bug is not a sign that you aren't ready for grad school. life is short. life is fucking short. and commitments happen FAST! and there are certain times of your life that make it harder and more difficult to travel. i went to grad school immediately after undergrad. i studied hard while i was in grad school, had a part time job to save up money, and had a hell of a time driving across the country when i graduated. i've since been an OT for 3+ years, same as my OT bf . we are just people that like adventures.

OccupationalTherapy,fnknas1,t1_fnjh0ak,1587033603.0,"I was laid off from my mental health job. Our department of OTs dissolved when our hospital was bought out by a bigger hospital corporation. I really loved the MH setting and wanted to stay in it, but finding jobs gets harder and harder. Some hospitals will use the occasional rec therapist, but the majority of groups are run just from people that are making minimum wage with a GED. If I really wanted to stay in MH, I'm sure I could have found a job that was a non-OT position.

Other settings (phys dys) are impacted moreso by policy/medicare changes, more than schools I'd say.  Or I guess with the current COVID19, outpatient therapists at my rehab network are struggling. 
In terms of schools-being the most stable, maybe I'm just being optimistic because that's my full-time job. I work for a school-district, compared to a company that the school hires. To save money in the future, more schools could cut their district OTs and just hire the company OTs for cheaper pay.


I guess another piece of advice I would add- try to keep more than 1 set of skills when you go into the workforce. For example, when I worked in MH, I pretty much lost all my phys dys knowledge because I never used it. That's why I decided to get a 1x/month per diem job in rehab. You never know when there will be policy changes, a worldwide pandemic, and you might need to be in a setting that you didn't think you'd be working in! Stay versatile"
OccupationalTherapy,fniys2q,t1_fnis0rs,1586988784.0,"Also curious. There are SO many settings for OT. It also takes about a year to feel comfortable in a particular setting. Not that smoothjazz is asking for advice, but here's my .02. Give your first OT job an actual shot. This means a year minimum. If you don't like it, switch settings. After all of that hard work in school, fieldwork, and NBCOT, you need to *at least* give the career a shot. It's a huge learning curve being a new practitioner, and that can be uncomfortable. But every new OT goes through that stage. School teaches us fundamental skills. The rest of it we gain overtime with experience. Don't let that fool you into thinking your incompetent. You just don't have the experience yet. Keep an open mind, stay curious."
OccupationalTherapy,fni3cbp,t3_g1wgil,1586973273.0,"OT for 3.5 years

1. I work in a school system full-time, per-diem at a rehab hospital. This is my first year working in peds for OT. Prior to this, I was working inpatient mental health   

2. Definitely do not regret becoming an OT.   

3. I would suggest that students observe various settings for various positions (OT, SLP, guidance, PT, nursing, social work, LMHC). School is a lot of money, especially if you aren't getting any help! Don't make impulsive decisions.   

4. Problems in the field- there's a lot of overlap with other professions. This can make it hard for companies/businesses to find value in OT, if they can hire cheaper pay to do ""the same thing"".   

5. Future of OT- I'm not sure. What I do know is that I'm glad I switched into the school settings, because I think it is one of the most stable settings for the profession  

6. There will be politics wherever you work. Don't let it ruin the job for you."
OccupationalTherapy,fni28w7,t3_g1v3j1,1586972746.0,"1. If you are being serious, I would think about taking a year off for mental health. It sounds like you need a break. And that's okay. I have SLP friends that did this during SLP grad school. They returned a year later and are happily graduated, certified, and working in the field.
2. Think about the ""why"". Why did you decide to go into OT? Why are you going to school? You said you want to contribute to society. There's gotta be more to this. If you are truly unable to answer this question, again, I would think about taking a year off, and perhaps, consider switching fields. And that's okay, and common.
3. Keep an open mind when you are in school. Don't assume that you know what you'll need to know. Don't assume what are you learning is a waste of time. This is a toxic and dangerous mindset. There is a good reason your professors are asking you to dig deep in your brain. Because one day when you are an OT, you won't be able to flip through a text book to find answers. They are training you to be independent and critical thinkers. It's hard, it's uncomfortable. Get used to it :)"

instead of waiting for a Eureka moment, kudos for taking more of a practical stance. you wrote down the pros and cons. this is great. maybe look into some of them further, such as how much the tuition is for the schools you'd apply, if you'd be able to work part-time during school, etc. to me, money is the biggest factor. you don't want to have to worry about insane student loans after you graduate. that will seriously impact your life and future. things that could change this would be a school with a lower tuition (worcester state in MA)/scholarship, if you can work during school, and if you could be in a situation to try and pay off loans fast when you graduate (ie- live at home for a 1-2 years).

1. make a google folder of OT resources you can use. i have specific folder called ""OT Resources"", and within it are additional folders labeled ""handwriting"", ""pre school"", ""sensory"",  ""fine motor"", etc.when i either find a resource or create a resource, i put it under the appropriate category. it saves a lot of time when providing resources to families. it also allows your boss to see what work you've compiled
2. make a spreadsheet (google form) with your entire caseload. include the following for each student (the following gets its own column):-
   1. Parent name
   2. Parent email/phone number
   3. Whether you reached out that week (so each week gets its own column) (ie- i might put, ""Emailed OT activity suggestions for week2""
   4. If the parent responded to your efforts (ie ""No parent response""). This is great to see which parents you really need to follow-up with if there are a few weeks of radio-silence
3. I've been sending out a weekly ""template"" for each of my students  via google doc. You can edit the sharing settings to, ""anyone with link gets access"", that way, you don't need to verify that the parent can access the document for every single one of your students.  i keep these templates in a folder called ""Week 1 templates"", and copy them over to ""week 2 templates"" before editing them a bit. and so on for the future weeks
4. We were provided a google form to track what we've been doing at home daily. if your district hasn't told you to do this yet, i would start anyways. track everything you've done at home (creating resources, emailing parents, professional development, etc).

OccupationalTherapy,fjyolcb,t1_fjyja0z,1583701231.0,"looks like i assumed my state policies were the same as the other states, thanks for notifying me that it's different. on a bigger note, sometimes i wish there wasn't so much ""gray"" area in OT responsibilities. when i was an OT in mental health, i was in charge of making goals/implementing interventions to build coping skills. but in the school system, that falls on guidance counselors. it becomes confusing on what the role is of OT depending on the setting. and now i'm learning, also depending on the state. i never would have thought that an OT would work on swallowing"
AdvancedRunning,fjt8zpr,t3_ferial,1583605267.0,i'm in a similar boat (registered for big sur marathon). how will you go about your training if you run a race that is 2-3 weeks after the boston date? just extend the taper?
OccupationalTherapy,fjt7mry,t3_fevswj,1583605016.0,"i've had a very similiar experience at my school! a teacher came to be about swallowing concerns for her student during snacktime, and when i brought it up to our SLPS, they all said ""that's more OT's scope, not us!"".  however, we all know in hospitals, (including the one i'm per diem at) SLPS are the ones working on chewing/swallowing, and not OTs. when i bring this up at the school, the SLPS just tell me, ""yeah SLPs might be doing it in SNFs but we aren't qualified to do it in a school"""

thebachelor,firzb3j,t3_f9b5z2,1582674227.0,"i agree that it's fair to ask that to your future husband, but madison also didn't really say that. peter asked, ""do you want me to end it with the other 2"", and she closed up. that was a great opportunity for her to say where she stands, more than just ""i don't want you to sleep with other girls"". right? or am i being an asshole?"

thebachelor,fijuy0h,t3_f7wewz,1582464917.0,"i agree with you, OP. however, i still find madison's decision to go on this show very interesting. we've learned that her and her family have very strong values and choices about intimacy. peter is already known as the windmill guy. even if he didn't sleep with the other girls, i wonder if his past sexual history would be too much for madison to be able to accept, and would cause issues in the future. there's always going to be memes and jokes about it. we also know that madison does have a level of insecurity (making posts on her fan account), which suggests she cares about what is  on social media and how she's portrayed on social media. i think all of this could cause problems in the future. insecurities can ruin such good things. and this seems more significant than just ""insecurities"", as deep-rooted values are involved. that being said, i don't think madison is ""stupid"" or ""entitled"" for her views and what she might ask of peter. love is complicated, man."

thebachelor,fi8ppou,t3_f6ssn6,1582245538.0,"unpopular opinion: i like peter. i think he's a good hearted guy. i think he's a nice guy. and i think this gets him into trouble (ie- being persuaded, trying to fix drama). i'm over everyone bashing him. it's easy to blast someone when you're on the other side of the screen. he reminds me of ben (who had a completely different flavor of girls on his season). i feel for peter. i don't think any of these girls are for him. it must be hard to be the lead and not have a great connection with any of the girls. like, shit. feels like a wasted opportunity. i imagine i would be in-denial and try to tell myself that X Y or Z could really work in the end.

i really hope him and hannah B make it work down the road. they had such good vibes."

OccupationalTherapy,fi869w7,t1_fi7sax9,1582234242.0,"haha. i got lucky in terms of the populations i work with. other schools in my district have special programs (such as intensive autism program, severe physical disabilities, etc). my school has the ""higher"" learning center. so in terms of the students i work with, it's the most mild in terms of disabilities. a lot of my students are in gen ed. for an OT that has 0 school experience, i got lucky"
OccupationalTherapy,fi59jj9,t1_fi2ytli,1582157995.0,average is a lot lower in MA (boston area0
OccupationalTherapy,fi3gj8z,t1_fi31o7b,1582118057.0,"I see about 30 kids for direct OT in a school. Majority is handwriting, where the goal might be forming particular letters, placing letters properly on the line, or appropriate spacing. For some of the kids that have more severe disabilities and handwriting isn’t progressing; the goal switches to typing. (Note- ive been told OT would never pick up a student for a typing goal, but only switch a handwriting goal to typing at the annual review of appropriate). 
I have a pre schooler with a feeding goal (he’s a picky eater), and a few younger kids with cutting goals or ADL goals (zipping jacket etc). 
I have a lot of students for OT consultation only for sensory needs"
OccupationalTherapy,fi3gf3b,t1_fi2ik1z,1582117827.0,Omg the IEP drama is so real. My first year in a school and I’m trying to learn how to stick to my guns. Some of these parents are brutal. Luckily my SPED team is very supportive of related services
OccupationalTherapy,fi3gd6e,t1_fi1qwl8,1582117718.0,This is my situation too! Except my per diem job is rehab. How long have you been at the school for? What’s your grade Levels  and caseload like? Are there any other OTs or COTAs there ?

movies,fhyycq7,t1_fhuq35s,1581986620.0,"right, exactly. like when she was talking to the doctor and the social worker about her delusions. it was such a great example of what it's like to talk to someone that is mentally ill- you can't rationalize it. just like the social worker stated- it's HER truth, her reality.  none of it makes sense, because it's not real"
movies,fhorbd7,t3_f04hkd,1581770786.0,"it's probably because i have a long history of working in a psychiatric hospital, but this movie wasn't up to interpretation IMO, it was clearly about a young female with schizophrenia (paranoid delusions). the ending was another delusion. she didn't kill herself."
