UnresolvedMysteries,fkajrzg,t3_fhdgbp,1584010857.0,"This case is definitely unresolved, but honestly it doesn’t seem particularly mysterious to me. Sounds like he was involved in the drug scene in some way, most likely as a fairly small time dealer, and someone killed him for cutting in on their business, for real or perceived disrespect, or something similar. It sounds like they targeted him at the ATM in a half-hearted effort to disguise it as a robbery gone wrong, but given that they didn’t take the money that seems unlikely to be the true motive. The connection to Ronald Goldman seems to me most likely to be a red herring, though I haven’t looked into the details of their relationship at all & could of course be wrong. 

One aspect that does seem to have some mystery to it is the possibility of Long’s involvement; even that though is just a nebulous sense of suspicion, mostly based on the sentence “Long, who witnessed the entire incident, was not harmed.” It seems a bit odd to me that she saw it all happen & her statement wasn’t enough to keep the three men from being released, but that can easily be explained by anything from low visibility due to distance/darkness to refusal to testify due to fear of retaliation. 

An interesting case though, and a good write up, it just seems more sad than mysterious to me."
