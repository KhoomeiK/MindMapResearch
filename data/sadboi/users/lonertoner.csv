mentalhealth,fcn7red,t3_ei3gyj,1577805470.0,"Hey. I can relate heavily to the feeling of career decision regret. I’d say, regret will make you feel even more crappy and will tap into the very anxiety you have tried so desperately to run from. If you are truly passionate about something in the medical field, have you considered looking into going back now? I know you may think it’s too late, but it surely isn’t. Also, don’t compare yourself to the person you are dating or anyone for that matter. Comparison is the thief of joy they say, so find your own purpose as you deserve peace and joy. Maybe accounting isn’t right for you, or maybe you haven’t find a place in accounting that is satisfactory. Regardless, it’s never too late to make a change. Change is scary, but with time it may be worth it. 

P.S. I hope to one day take this advice as my own.

Much love!"
mentalhealth,fclojj0,t3_ehponz,1577752660.0,"Interestingly, I am a woman but have been that man at several points in my life. The thing with mental illness is the amount of stigma around it. Being honest is not often the best policy it seems as people often leave or break things off with persons who are undergoing these things. I understand that you may have been in a tough situation, but I think he was hiding these aspects of himself out of fear of judgment. I hope he does end up doing better and finds someone in his life he can vocalize these feelings about. 

I know you may feel torn between this, but you made the decision you felt was best for you. Depression is complicated. Mental health is complicated. Given that you may not be enduring depression, it may seem more like general betrayal—but I don’t believe that was his intent. I hope you find it in yourself to forgive him. I am not saying to reconnect for the sake of doing so, but forgiving him so you can forgive yourself due to a decision you made—which is neither good nor bad, but a choice. Much love!"
