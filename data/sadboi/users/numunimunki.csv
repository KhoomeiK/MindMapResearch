Once this all began I started to slip back into old habits and have lost a significant amount of weight again but I am actively trying to force myself to eat to avoid a relapse. I've gone from a size 6 to a size 4 now. I'm not underweight, and I am trying my best to tackle it alone to avoid that situation.

 I'm quite disappointed in myself because I had made a huge amount of progress in the last few years, and managed to put on about 3 and a half stone, when I was just over 5 and a half stone at my lowest weight. 

I know from speaking to others who have suffered from eating disorders on here, that they are also using their diet as a crutch, or a form of control in this time of uncertainty."

Its great to see a ed related post outside of their communities. I'm seeing a lot of the posts that are supposed to be recovery positive, but you can tell that a lot of the people involved are still just body-checking and putting counteractive titles on them to disguise that fact.

I've started posting pictures on r/anorexianervosa and r/anorexiarecovery to try combat these kind of behaviours with images of my dinners during times when I experience extreme hunger, and also body positive images of my belly rolls and body hair in hope that I can help at least one person out there. 

A lot of people are kidding themselves into believing that they are or have recovered, but just because you're weight is restored doesn't mean that you are.

 Anorexia is a severe phychological disorder which results in detrimental physical health effects, and sometimes death. 

Its about healing the body AND the mind. 

I'm so delighted that you have come this far 🥰, and we are all extremely proud of you. You can truly conquer anything this world throws at you now, you've done it, what you thought before was impossible. You are powerful, and unstoppable!!


You've done such a wonderful thing and I truly believe you will reach above and beyond now in the future. Anorexia is one of the toughest things to overcome, everything else now will be a piece of cake 😎💜💜💜


Never be afraid to ask for help from someone. If you recognize any weird habits or rituals coming back in the future, especially in times of stress, please be honest with yourself and try nip it in the bud as soon as you can. Be kind to yourself 🥰


*******

And to those commenting asking for pro ana tips or tricks, HOW DARE YOU!! Its a psychological disorder with a HUGE death rate. There is nothing glamorous about this whatsoever!!!

At the end of my journey I was left with brain damage, my hair had fallen out, I lost 3 teeth from gum disease, a stammer, anemia which caused so many bruises you couldn't even count them all, severe mental health issues with countless mental breakdowns, and suicidal tendencies, body dysphoria, and an overall loss of sense of self. It took years to rebuild myself again, and its continuous work even still. 

It is not a fad, it is not cool, its not trendy!!! 

This is no joke. 

Love yourself for who you are 💜💜💜

The one thing that really changed my mind was that I wanted my life back too. The health complications from anorexia started to catch up with me, both mentally and physically. I started balding and losing my teeth. I grew hair on my face and all over my body because my body was trying to protect me from the cold (I'm from Ireland). I suffered from extreme brain fog, chronic fatigue and memory loss.

 I fainted almost everyday and had a very expensive caffeine addiction which resulted in continuous nightmares and anxiety and paranoia. I'd lost all elements of my personality and become a complete shell of a human being. 

I really thought my life was over, anorexia had completely taken over, until one day it dawned on me that I couldn't remain present in a conversation anymore. I had become a boring person to be around, and obsessive and completely overwhelmed with new changes in everyday life. I was exhausted. 

Recovery is not easy, but it is possible. You are strong, you are worthy, and you are capable. 



If you have any questions about recovery, please feel free to dm me. I will not answer questions about how I became anorexic because I feel that can be triggering for most people experiencing it, or even curious people.

 I will be more than happy to answer questions on my journey to recovery, based on my own experience only. I also think its important to mention that I am not a nutritionist or a health care professional.  

I wish you all the best in you're recovery. You have my full support 🥰💜🥰💜💜🥰💜🥰"

So I drained some tofu and used this technique I found on youtube to cut and squeeze and drain all the liquid out of it, you any sauce or marinade will absorb better and gives it a crispier texture when you fry it. 

Ill leave that link here. 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLwDYQxdc5_Q&ved=2ahUKEwi4v4uO9qToAhVoUhUIHUQsBnQQwqsBMAB6BAgFEAQ&usg=AOvVaw09cNCyRPRvAnMDI3Sl5LfC

Emmmmm everything else I pretty much winged really. 

I marinaded the tofu in squeezed garlic, honey, chilli pepper, bitta hoisin sauce and soy sauce. 

As that was soaking away I chopped some shallots (onions work fine too), some left over mushrooms, red bell pepper, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower (again just whatever I had going on in the fridge), and fried that up in oil and cayenne pepper, salt and pepper.

 I tossed in the tofu and let it all cook together. I used wholegrain egg noodles, cooked them according to packet instructions and drained them a minute early so I could finish them with the stir fry. Tasted it, seasoned to taste, and finished it off with some chopped spring onions for garnish. 

I usually let the vegetables and tofu cooked til a bit charred cus I think it works well with the whole sweet/ spicy thing going on."

The day I finished my final exam, my boyfriend and best friend of 4 years broke up with me in a shopping centre parking lot, and I never saw him again.

Looking back on it now we were probably not the most compatible, but the day itself was more symbolic to me. I didn't think I was going to finish school, because I thought I would be dead before I even had the chance. 

I hated myself so much. I always did, and this validated my feelings even more. I never allowed myself any congratulations or validation, it had all crumbled in that one day. Everything turned to nothing.

Months had passed, I hardly left my room, only to get fucked up and party/ numb myself. I needed to reclaim my life again. I needed to regain some control. 

Thats when I discovered bartending. 
I loved bartending. I was good at it, I loved the attention. For the first time in my life I felt powerful and sexy and strong. I started to lose weight over time and I loved that. A job path that also doubled up as a free gym. I had every man I could have ever dreamed of at the tip of my fingers!  I was thriving, or so I thought I was...

The unsocial hours started to take the better of me. Outside of my work life I was a very lonely person. No man ever stuck around, because I was just their bartender fantasy, a quick fuck and go. I was unhappy again, exhausted, and felt out of control. 

I began to starve myself. Blinded by my vice, my control, I always seeked comfort and control through eating disorders. 

Months went by, it was all going great. I had regained some confidence through my rituals. I felt prepared and always wore a smile. I even got offered some television work! 

Behind the scenes was a different story. I almost failed to get up out of bed everyday. Having to make a cup of coffee every night before bed, just so I could keep it by my bedside to drink cold the next morning to have enough energy to go downstairs to make my actual cup of coffee seemed normal to me. I started to get weak, collapsing regularly, blaming it on lack of sleep or bad sleep etc. 

The people around me started to notice. My hair started to fall out, I lost some teeth. I still kept going on clueless, happy go lucky. I pushed myself too far. 

It all caught up on me eventually. One afternoon I was mess playing with my then housemate, now partner. I collapsed, this time hitting my head. 

I was 21 years of age, 78 pounds, and had suffered a severe brain injury. I was taken to hospital and examined immediately. I can't remember a lot of it but the whole thing was taken very seriously. I was handed a manual on brain injury services and was booked in for appointments for brain training for there on after. I was advised to not do anything for a year.

Didn't take it too seriously, went back to work after eleven days. Concealing my memory loss, feeling embarrassed about it all, thinking ill never be the same person ever again. Waking up everyday confused and out of control emotional. I needed a lot more help than I had asked for. 

Its taken me the guts of 3 years to feel myself again, the process being mentally torturing, but working through healing my physical body, helped with the mental healing process. 

And here I am now 24, at a healthy weight for the first time in a long time, still being mindful of my recovery. 

Im headed to university now in September. Finally starting a new journey to the rest of my life, and finally feeling positive and sure for the first time since I don't know when.

Thank you reddit for providing the awesome supportive space to share my story."

At least with insomnia you know you are gonna need another one after it, its so weak you can't taste any coffee in it and its so disappointing!! 

Frank and honest is quite nice, kinda gingerbready taste off it. Good amount of caffeine going on there.

Costa is muck.

I always feel like ive popped a yolk after drinking starbucks coffee, but the taste isn't great. Usually conceal it with some flavoured syrup if I have to. 

Macdonalds coffee can be 50/50 depending on where you get it and the time of day. With their new number system sometimes the drink is already made before you've ordered it and its left sitting there. If you get a cappuccino or a latte and you open the lid, the foam has often disappeared and sunken into the coffee, which now just makes it a white coffee. 

Nero coffee is quite strong, not prepared the best but I appreciate that when you order a mocha they use Cadbury chocolate powder rather than those mank chocolate flavoured syrups. Black coffee there is alright too, but usually get a cappuccino/ mocha simply because of how hot their drinks are made. 

My favourite places for coffee are The Brewery in Maynooth, Vice coffee on Middle Abbey St, and 2 beans in Dun Laoghaire."

Bring them out of their 'all mighty successful bubble of whatever' for a second and into the real world for a second. Human beings are wonderful complex and detailed engines. We're all built differently, and if we allow it besides are social behaviors, we can think differently too. If we all thought the same there would be no more progression in the world, no more substantial success for us to achieve. 

There are supposedly many different types of intelligence, and in psychology its theorized that it would take more than one type of these to achieve success. You studying what you think is right for you're families sake is you actually limiting you're success ultimately, because you are not utilising the intelligence you were born with, and the same probably applies for them too.

According to google we have
▪︎Naturalist Intelligence
