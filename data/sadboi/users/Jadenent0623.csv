I recently checked myself into a stress center because it had gotten that bad, been in the program for about three weeks now. Progress is slow and often feels like it doesn’t exist at all, but people say it’s there, so counts for something, right? Anyway, I just wanna say that I really appreciate the audio. I know it was probably cathartic for you, but it also gives me a some sense of purpose, even if it is just imaginary.That maybe one day, I can be the thing that keeps someone grounded, that’s enough for me.  

Enough with my oversharing sappiness, I just want to say that your audio gives people feelings that are more than just arousal, and I think that’s important. Life can be shit, sometimes, sometimes it’s shit all the time. Hope things will be on the upside soon. Until then, good luck!"

But if you’re looking for a more sweet fragrance for more all encompassing, go for Versace Eros. It’s a compliment magnet. Spicebomb extreme is more of a spicy taste but still really great, but not as many women recognize it as much as YSL or D&G. If you’re looking for an office fragrance, you can’t go wrong with Burberry Touch. All of them get a decent amount of compliments but def the YSL, D&G, and Versace are killers."
