Interstitialcystitis,fj8mgrv,t3_fc3351,1583116835.0,"I think it is a good thing that you have already found a doctor who knows about IC. I would say be careful with the antibiotics, especially if your urinalysis results keep coming back clear. I went through the same thing when my IC first flared up - round after round of antibiotics - and I ended up with a rare, painful, and difficult to treat yeast infection in my esophagus caused by the antibiotics."

Interstitialcystitis,fj1efcf,t3_faxd5t,1582918353.0,"I only ever wore pants until I got IC. Then, wearing pants was so uncomfortable because of the pressure on my pelvic area that I had to switch to wearing only skirts and dresses for years. It completely changed my personal style and was somewhat distressing at first gender-wise. Due to improvements in my symptoms, I’m able to wear pants again sometimes, but I have to wear stretchy ones that are too big for me.  I wear baggy tights sans control top under my skirts in the winter."
SkincareAddiction,fip7x7l,t3_f93fwj,1582600013.0,I use this on my face as my moisturizer day and night. I love it. Cleared up my skin and doesn’t give me cystic acne like regular Cerave.
yoga,fiovv8y,t3_f913sk,1582592212.0,"I had laparoscopic surgery back in August. Took me a while to feel normal again, and there are still some things that are a little too much for me. I can’t speak to yoga practice too much specifically because I only do yoga occasionally. My back and hips had to pick up a lot of the slack from my abs having tiny holes cut into them. I had trouble lifting my legs to put on socks for a few weeks! Every body is different and recovers at different paces. So if you feel out of wack, that’s normal, and in time you will feel like yourself again!"

Interstitialcystitis,fhsdc6a,t3_f4ja6u,1581859147.0,"I had really bad IC for over two years before a doc diagnosed me and sent me for my first instillation. I can’t promise it will be the same for you, but by the time I got in my car after my first instillation, I was SOBBING because I already felt so much better! For the first time in years, I could not feel my bladder. They put analgesics in the instillation, which gave me the most thorough relief. It may be a little difficult to pee right after because the analgesics are so good you won’t be able to feel the muscles that you use to pee (or at least that’s how it was with me).

There is a little bit of a pinching feeling when the catheter goes in, but it’s quick and then it’s over (plus they use it to drain your bladder first, which is a relief). The catheter is in for less than a minute. It’s really fast. I remember the medicine felt cold at first, but then I felt nothing.

I did have a pretty bad flare about six weeks in to my treatment, but once that was over, my IC was never as bad as it was those first two years. I can’t promise it will be like that for you, but there’s hope! 

Good luck!! I really hope this works for you!"

My background is in cognitive development and some of these I read as an undergrad a while ago, so that has shaped my selections above. What are you interested in more specifically?"

Professors,f6qmj2r,t3_dsbyy1,1573080636.0,"I work in assessment in higher ed. Would much rather be teaching and actually working with students, but that pays much less and there are far fewer positions out there for teaching, it seems. That said, I do think faculty would benefit from more professional development when it comes to teaching - I would have liked that back when I was teaching, and I think it would have made for better courses when I was an undergrad and a grad student. I wish the focus was less on compliance with federal regulations and more on helping faculty and students."
