depression,flo5w52,t1_flnoqtl,1585332188.0,"I've been gaining weight so I'm planning on cutting back on the alcohol. I think I drink 1-1.5 bottles a week?

I don't want to tell my therapist about the cutting. I haven't been seeing them for long and don't really trust them yet. Plus, they'll likely try to baker act me. Been tempted to either quit the meds or take the rest in one sitting... it's ridiculous. I know.


Opening up to people makes me hate myself even more. I hate when people worry about me. It makes me even more of a burden."

nutrition,f5rud2f,t1_f5rowgg,1572403249.0,Oh Lord. I didn't even think of that! Maybe I can eat some broccoli and kale in a smoothie or something.
nutrition,f5qv3tk,t1_f5qi3qz,1572383486.0,"I would maybe eat kale. That's it. Everything else seems to have too much sugar, is too acidic, or seems too hard to eat. :( I think I need help."
nutrition,f5q3wob,t3_do8kts,1572372165.0,"I hope this is appropriate. I'm wondering if it's silly to begin taking 500mg of vitamin C every day or so. 


So, my diet has changed a lot in the past year due to outside circumstances. I don't eat any of the foods that seem to have a good amount of vitamin C. The only thing I can honestly think of is sweet potato, and I'm not even sure about that. I'm afraid to try to even eat things like cooked broccoli because of my teeth. I'm concerned that I'm going to become deficient in vitamin C soon because of my diet, if I'm not already lol. I just don't think any of the foods I eat have much, if any, vitamin C.


I figured I can maybe take 500mg pills each day or two (or three if that's better) while I address my likely irrational fears and beliefs. I'm also considering getting bloodwork done to see where I'm at. Maybe I'm doing better than I thought...but the thought of scurvy or general gum issues scares me to death.


Is it a stupid idea to take pills like that?"

I hope that you can find a better therapist soon - I saw your comment about how they basically invalidated you and said ""happiness is a state of mind"" in response to your PTSD. That's abysmal. 


I hope you can find someone who understands you and is willing to work with you. You don't have to carry this all on your own. You deserve to get help to conquer this."
Frugal,eypmtjr,t3_cy2is9,1567304736.0,"I start my Christmas shopping/presents at least half a year ahead of time (for adults in my family, at least). This year I'm doing paintings of things important to my loved ones, like pets or scenery. Painting toys for the kids. It's cheap but will hopefully be appreciated.

Of course I'm also straight up buying gifts. But I'm trying to be more thoughtful about it."
