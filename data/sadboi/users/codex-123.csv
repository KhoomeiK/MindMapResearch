depression,f7bvgt6,t3_dpl4bu,1573578531.0,"I feel this so much. I have it in my head that I don’t need help from a professional unless I’m suicidal so I just need to “get over it” on a daily basis. I know this isn’t true but I’m still trying to summon the courage to see a therapist. 

The only person that knows I am depressed is my husband. Everyone else thinks that I am fine because the only “symptom” they can see is that I call in sick to work every once in a while to give myself a mental health break. They don’t know how difficult it is for me to keep this charade going. And I wish I didn’t have to."
