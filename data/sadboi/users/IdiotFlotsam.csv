marfans,f7demx9,t3_dvjxvg,1573614757.0,"1. My spouse and children have Marfans. For daily life - we spend about 1/5th of our income on health care so we try to live a pretty frugal life. I do not let my children participate in most athletic activities - mostly for health reason. But my oldest was very self conscious in P.E., so I will get them out of things for confidence issues as well.
2. I feel discouraged and worried often. One child has already passed away and I've sat through many surgeries. I feel like it causes a lot of anxiety in all of us. What bad thing is going to happen next? Who is going to need the next surgery?
3. The health care my kids get is mainly a ""wait and see"" approach. So they are probably going to be dealing with anxiety about it the rest of their lives. They will know they are probably going to need a major surgery but when? For their appearance, they may feel self conscious at times but since they have family that looks like them, that might help some. I agree with the previous comments that people assume they are older so we've had some rude comments before. On a lighter note, my kids have had huge disappointments about never fitting in a Power Wheel car. 

Good luck with your project! I'm impressed on how much research you are doing. Please, consider a career in health care ;)"

I'm trying to find the balance in taking care of family vs taking care of myself and I rarely can seem to get as much time for myself as I require to be a sane, happy person.  Maybe it takes more practice."

marfans,eu52azc,t3_cel7of,1563468371.0,We order online for pretty much everything because even chain stores that have tall sizes don't tend to keep a lot on hand.  Lands End and LL Bean have business casual tall clothes (Lands End has some long sleeve buttons ups now for $20 with size 37 sleeves).  ASOS has great clearance and they ship really fast (like 2 days arrival times).  Another option for an inexpensive blazer is to hit up a thrift shop/ebay for one that will mostly fit and just take it in to get the sleeves let out as much as possible.  Good luck!  It takes time but you'll get there with a good wardrobe.
