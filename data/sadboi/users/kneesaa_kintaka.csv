I’ve recently started seeing someone and they asked me why I didn’t date much before. I realized I did not have the time before now. I wanted to, but I was in school in two very difficult and time consuming programs, working, and volunteering. I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep to even keep up my relationships with my friends. TBH I was very insecure about the fact that I never seriously dated anyone during this time, but, looking back, it was the right decision. The hard work and focus payed off. I’m in the beginning of a career I love and am good at and now I have the time and energy (and money because real job) and schedule consistency to do all the fun things I thought I was missing out on without having to stress about dropping the ball somewhere else.

So I agree with this person. It’s okay to focus on what you need to do right now to achieve your goals and you’ll have time for dating later once you aren’t in school."

I know it’s hard, but I have never had someone respond negatively to this. They are usually very supportive.

I agree with a lot of what people here said about not getting validation from others and loving yourself. But I want to add some very practical advice.

I was in this same situation in college and I worked a lot on my self esteem. I’m 25 (F) now.

I was really good at convincing myself that no men found me attractive because I wasn’t getting hit on and all that. I watch some video at one point that made a good point saying that the guys that have the confidence to hit on girls and tell them they’re pretty etc. are not a large percent of all guys, just the ones you hear. 

I ended up installing a dating app (I prefer hinge) as a kind of experiment. (I did fully intend on going on dates with guys that I found interesting and attractive.) I got likes quickly. Some by guys I thought were physically attractive, some not, some where the personality they showed in the profile was attractive, some not so much. I don’t know what the gender ratio is like where you are, but from most of the stats I’ve read, you will get likes. 

I want to be clear, this isn’t using it as a confidence boost. It’s proving to your brain that tries to convince you that no one is interested, that actually some guys are and you may even be interested back. It provides an opportunity for those guys that you may pass on the street that would think you’re cute to shoot their shot without a massive fear of rejection and you see that there really are guys of all types that are attracted to you. Plus you may even meet someone great!

To the first:
So like, with the close friends I was talking about, I feel like I can make more sexual comments/jokes, talk about if I’m like horny or attracted to someone or something because they know my history and that I’m inexperienced, yet well informed.

I guess right now, with the larger group, I’m trying to like join in on the conversations when they talk about sex or attraction and add my input to show I think about it? Idk does that make sense? But sometimes I feel weirdly insecure like “what if I say something that’s too much”

I’m also trying to voice when I think someone is attractive (at the same rate as everyone else, not aggressively lol), but that’s tricky because I try to be conscious about not making anyone feel bad. Like if I’m with my guy friends, I don’t want to be like “oh so-and-so could get it” and then make them feel bad or insecure because they don’t look like that person.

To the second:
I think what I mean is just like the fact that I am an adult and I want to be able to portray myself as sexy and not just ‘cute’. I want to be flirty and act a little risqué (not sure if I can say the word I wanted to use there in this sub) at like clubs and stuff.

I’ve (25F) gone through several stages on this topic:

- Growing up, for religious reasons, I used to think sex before marriage was a sin, not in a judgy way, but like agreeing to be Christian meant to agreeing to that. 

- Around college I did more study and figured out more of what I believed and decided I don’t think it’s a sin, but waiting was still a logically good decision because it wasn’t worth risking getting pregnant.

- Now, I’m financially stable and would still be fine to wait, but I’m in a position in life where I could handle the consequences. So if I were in a serious relationship, sex before marriage would be a possibility. I do know myself well enough though to know that casual sex wouldn’t work for me.

I took his Math 301(?) class (basically proof writing) before I took Discrete from him. He was the same way. You just need to learn his wording. It is VERY formulaic. Someone else suggested writing word for word what he does in your notes. Absolutely do this and learn his format for the different types. For example, if you’re doing proof by induction in the homework, literally copy what he would say for everything but the problem specific parts. Iirc he gives enough homework that it will eventually stick. 

It’s super annoying that he’s so strict on it, but in my experience, following it helps you figure out how to do the proof.

With the “we assume” vs “there is” he’s picky on that because you are distinguishing between an assumption you made (could be wrong) and a fact. That’s how I remember it anyway.

I will add that before I started I was going on 5 mile runs, but my pace was slow because I was running 1/4 mile, then walking 1/4, then running, etc. I just struggled to do 1 mile of nonstop running. If that makes a difference.

This week:
Monday - 2.25 miles at 11’24’’ average per mile
Wednesday - 1.75 miles at 11’24’’ average per mile
Friday - 3.5 miles at 12’16’’  average per mile

Next week:
Monday - benchmark run (7minute warmup, 3 minutes as fast as I can, and 5 minute cool down)
Wednesday- 9 x 200 meters with 3 min 45 sec of rest in between (8’37’’ pace, but I usually sprint so I go quite a bit faster)
Friday- 6.5 miles at 12’33’’"

dating_advice,erm7j73,t1_erm6mg0,1561009103.0,"What I’m most likely to say yes to for a first date (this goes for most of my friends too) is a weeknight activity (like drinks) that’s in a public place (safety).

If you are already friends, you can use coordinating trying to do something as a way. So if you are planning to go to a party or something, you can give her your number or ask for hers so you can let her/the group know when you’re headed there or more details or something. It sounds kinda dumb, but I’ve both done this and had this done to me and it’s a way to do it without making it obvious. 

For snap, it’s probably easier. “Hey I was gonna send you a snap of ____ the other day, but I realized I don’t have you on snap”"

I’m a woman in CS and have been working at a big tech company for about a year and a half now. The company I work for does not tolerate behavior like that toward anyone. I experienced a bit of it while in school, but some of my later courses were taught by female professors and I have a ‘prove them wrong attitude’. 

Some people on here have said to stand up to them and, while I personally would do that, I know there are a lot of women who don’t feel comfortable doing it. A less direct way of standing up to them is asking why they said what they said. I’ve made friends with a few of these idiots by asking ‘what do you mean by that?’ And having a calm conversation about it. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting them, here are some things I’ve learned that I hope help.


1) In my experience, the guys that behave this way usually fall behind in course work so there is a chance if you stick with it, you’ll only have to deal with them for a few classes.

2) In my experience, the women in CS classes tend to do better because they are determined to prove the assholes wrong. Eventually those guys end up asking us for help on their work.

3) Make friends with professors. (This really goes for any class.) Not in a suck up way, but make sure they know who you are. Ask questions, sit toward the front, and chat with them every once in a while. It will help you when you start trying to find internships or jobs and if they see you as a person, they are more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assignments or someone trying to take credit for something you did.

4) Profs can be dicks too. If you get a bad teacher, doing number 3 can be super helpful. I’ve had to go to other professors to get help on material for a class. 

5) I think others have said this, but find a female professor or instructor in CS or engineering that can be your mentor. They should know the proper channels to deal with these issues.

Edit: 6) Try to make some guy friends in the class. They can be good allies and can do the echoing thing others have talked about."
AskMen,equ04us,t1_eqs9mxi,1560322520.0,"As a girl with a lot of guy friends, if one of my friends said they were interested in me and I didn’t want to be more than friends, our friendship would still be fine on my end. So as someone else mentioned, as long as you can handle her not reciprocating, go for it. 

How you do it is up to you, but I’m a fan of saying something like “I’m interested in you as more than a friend” and talking about it. Reason being, if you ask her on a date, but stumble over it and don’t make it obvious that it is a date, you’ll be back where you started. Have a date idea in mind already in case she says she’s interested too!

Good luck!"
AskWomen,eohpg6z,t3_bro887,1558588180.0,"For me, I had to start with my mental health. 

TLDR: Had to make sure I was doing it for the right reasons and counting calories was really bad/not sustainable for me.

Every time I tried before this one, I was doing it out of not liking myself or wanting to please others. That lead to obsessing over calories and numbers in an unhealthy way and having a bad day would make me feel worse about myself.

I took some time to learn to love myself the way I am and not care about the scale for a while. I gained weight during that period of time, but I was happy with who I was and learned to love my body the way it is.

This time I’ve been focusing on healthy habits. I started walking/running a few days a week and lifting weights twice a week. That has been working pretty well for me even though the weight loss was slow at first, I felt good because I was exercising. It helped my sleeping and eating habits to exercise too. I find I don’t crave junk food as much on the days I work out. 

Through talking to my doctor, I recently found out that my body doesn’t process high carb foods very well. So I’ve cut back on things like bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes. Basically I don’t eat those for most of the week, but on the weekend I have some (normal portions not going crazy). I love all those foods so I told my doctor I couldn’t completely give them up. That has helped speed up weight loss for me a lot partially because less carbs means less calories, but also because I don’t have the inflammatory issues that the carbs were causing anymore.

I’ve seen a lot of people suggests counting calories and while that works for some people, it’s really hard on me mentally. Especially since being healthy is a lifelong choice, I couldn’t see myself counting calories and obsessing about it for the rest of my life. So I just try to choose nutritious and tasty foods and cook my own food instead of buying pre-packaged."
