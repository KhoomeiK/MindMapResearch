ptsd,fpj3vur,t3_gdq3hd,1588655859.0,I keep productive on my anniversary. I have to be making or building or creating. I can’t find myself with time to spiral. Any hobbies you can get lost in?
plantclinic,fnwq8e4,t1_fnwpnv9,1587323304.0,"There are thick white roots coming out the bottom and have been since I got them from the nursery. The pot seems to have a good amount of soil when I water them so I’m really not sure. I’m likely going to have to cut the pot off when its time to move them. 

They both seem super happy like my other philodendrons but I worry that when they get big they’ll be too close. I’m going to have to repot probably in a few weeks, I’m just not sure if I should break them up when I do."

Pottery,fbtjra0,t1_fbtiy3c,1577081496.0,I’ll post both pinched pour overs from that view. They’re not off centred. It was a fix from slightly floppy forms that I thought wouldn’t work but worked so well that I might do it all the time.
Pottery,fbthqfx,t1_fbthood,1577079301.0,It’s a pinched side to the coffee pour over. I wasn’t sure I was going to like it until I glazed it. This was my least favourite. I’m in love now.
ptsd,facc45z,t3_e8bu8c,1575936843.0,"Tomorrow the clock resets and you get you be yourself again for another 11 months or so. I try to stay productive on mine. My family decided to take my last anniversary off with me and I allowed in ONLY if we were constantly being productive. I have to be doing something that is going somewhere or I spiral. 

Tomorrow!"
ptsd,f9wlsbh,t3_e78lc7,1575694723.0,"I always disclose to people I work closely with. I have a significant anniversary regarding my event and I’m mostly okay throughout the year if I’m not triggered, but the weeks leading up to and the actual anniversary I am just not myself. 

I am not ashamed about what I went through. I don’t advertise it but if it might affect someone I’ll let them know."

ptsd,f0k7g2a,t3_d51bvy,1568672243.0,"I feel like I died that day, too. There’s a before and an after. I have had a wonderful life since full of happiness and opportunity (all unrelated) but I will never stop grieving for the old me. She’s gone.

It does get better over time but it will never go away. I’m mostly fine on the daily but I’m always hyper vigilant and on the look out for triggers. I’m not sure how much longer I can keep up but so far it’s not too bad."
