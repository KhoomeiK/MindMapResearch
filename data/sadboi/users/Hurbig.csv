KingkillerChronicle,fr0n182,t3_glxk8h,1589801201.0,"Not to sound like a man hater, but I think the difference is that the Sherlock fandom consists of mostly women while the KKC fandom has more men. I get why her behavior might seem very frustrating to a guy, but as a woman I never hated her. That doesn’t mean she’s perfect, she obviously has flaws, but she also has to make hard decisions. I really think she doesn’t realize how her behavior can be hurtful, but it’s not like she’s doing anything morally wrong (that we know of at this point) on purpose.

However in many works of fiction the female side character exists to support the main character and will eventually fall in love with him and make him feel great about himself. That’s why readers (and I mean female readers as well) get irritated by the fact that Denna is more a challenge to Kvothe than she is support.

Even Irene who was a challenger in the beginning ends up on the same side as Sherlock and needs his help and makes him feel great about himself. The Irene from the books is quite different, but that’s a topic for another day."

FullmetalAlchemist,fqlidzl,t3_gj9ck3,1589458907.0,"Yeah, it is a bit frustrating, but you have to understand this was the only way the brothers could live without regret. I think they had their minds set on not using the stone because they were terrified of losing their way. The show is very much about sacrifices for the greater good and the Elric saw first hand how Mustang, Hawkeye and all the others committed terrible atrocities because they thought it was necessary. It’s not so easy to tell when you’re in the story at what point you cross the line.

As for giving up his alchemy: The two main reasons Ed was interested in Alchemy were bringing his mother back and restoring Al’s body. One he realized he could never do and the other he achieved. Of course he had an interest in alchemy before that, but he just didn’t need it anymore and maybe he even was sick of it being most of his identity. 

As for them separating, they are not forever separated obviously. They are still brothers and still very close and in the credits you can see pictures of them being together when they’re older. I also think that Ed probably stayed in Resembool once he had children, because to him it would have been so important to have his father around. Ed and Al have been together all their lives and it’s only healthy to take a step back from that and to go off on their own adventures."
loseit,fqlh7fe,t3_gjfe79,1589458011.0,"You are not going to lose weight like this and I’m not sure you fully understand why. Yes, in theory it’s just CICO and yes, you have learned the hard way that if’s much more difficult in practice. However, if you hate your diet so much that you suffer from it even though you can’t stick to it, then you’re not going to be able to lose weight.

You need to find a way to make weight loss less stressful, disappointing and self-hatred inducing. Maybe you could try intermitted fasting, meal prep, cheat days or anything like that. Try to think what about what healthy meals you would really enjoy to eat. Try to think about how you can limit the temptations. If you have tons of unhealthy snacks in your house it’s obviously going to be very hard. If you go out too much or order too much food, then maybe make a rule with your husband that only he should be able to say when is an appropriate time. It’s not as easy as knowing what the right thing to do is and then doing it. It’s not reasonable to ask of yourself to be able to always make the right decision, so you need to find a setup where you don’t constantly have to decide not to overeat, but where you have no choice or ideally, where you don’t even think about it.

Also, you don’t seem like the type that deals well with all-or-nothing kinds of solutions. Maybe try to take it slow. Set a realistic goal on MFP where you don’t have to achieve a deficit and then try reducing it over time. For me a strategy that worked really well too was this: Whenever I wanted to eat a snack, I would take it out, lay it before me and then put half of it back. I was still allowed to eat the other half later, but often times I didn’t even want to."

It’s important to take his feelings into consideration with this because he might not have imagined that he’d ever have to cut down on porn and may initially be quite shocked by the idea. Let him think about it before you ask him to do anything concrete.

It might help you to think more about how him watching porn makes you feel. Are you jealous? Do you think it’s unethical? Do you feel betrayed? Are you disgusted or disappointed? Ashamed? Angry?

Though it my seem like Denna exploits men for “fun” he does explain really well that for a young woman without family there aren’t a lot of options. I also like that even though Kvothe is some sort of OP that can do almost everything almost perfectly there is Devi who can do it better.

But the whole thing with Felurian, the fact that being raped by a beautiful woman is portrayed as a desirable thing, I really hate. And there’s lots of other small things, like Fela saying that women don’t like to be stared at by most guys, but when the guy is like Kvothe they secretly love it. Or the fact that Denna is some sort of femme fatale who leads Kvothe to his demise.

All in all I think the books do a lot of stuff right. We get a lot of strong female characters who are strong in different ways. There is a lot of icky stuff in the books too, but Pat never said that what he wrote is perfect.

What I did change thought is that I don’t drink sugary drinks anymore and don’t put milk in my coffee. When people say that you shouldn’t drink alcohol most of the time they are referring to the “don’t drink your calories” rule, because drinking calories makes it a lot harder to stay within your daily limit, since you’re not getting a fullness sensation from drinking (unless it’s a really thick smoothie.)

I just think that we don’t notice the feminists that aren’t radical because they aren’t as active or likely to be outraged at something.

It would be great if feminism could become more focused on equal rights instead of focusing on how women are affected by a situation. At the end of the day, both men and women are affected by gender inequality and I don’t think it would be fair to say that a women’s rights movement has no right to exist. I just wish we could work more together."

My favorite running shorts are an old pair from my brother. 
However, much more important than the size of the pocket is the ability to not slide down when you have a phone in your pocket. Make sure that they are either a tight fit or that they have a band that you can tie at the waist."

AskFeminists,fpr76ag,t1_fpr0x3m,1588844875.0,"Yeah, that's kind of my worry with MRA, if we have two different movements focusing on women's rights and men's rights then parts of those two groups will start blaming each other. MRA in my experience (which might not be representative of the truth) is heavily focused on how feminism hurt them and that feminism shouldn't exist anymore. Often it turns into a competition of who has it worse. We should be supportive of each others fights for gender equality and not only look at the problems that affect us personally. If feminism and MRA could work together, that would be great, but unfortunately that's not how it is."
AskFeminists,fpqzra6,t3_gez7mq,1588837378.0,"I wish that we could talk more and fight less, often times people who disagree with the feminist movement do not want women to suffer, they just disagree on how women suffer and how the problem should be fixed. I think it would be good if we could focus on common goals. However, I think that feminism is also there for men's rights. I think the MR movement is uncalled for because most members of the feminist community are very much willing to help fix where men are at a disadvantage, at least in my experience. There is always a very vocal minority that sees men as the enemy, but they are not representative of our goals in general. 

&#x200B;

Now, the reason why we talk about issues and how they affect women is because we feel those issues affect women more, but I would never tolerate it when a man is faced with those same issues. I often feel like women are not properly represented in media and politics. We don't feel seen or heard. Of course men are affected by things like body shaming, domestic violence, rape etc. too, and in some cases they are not believed, just because they're men. That's not right. But at the end of the day I just can't shake off the feeling that the society we live in was laid out for men. And there are lots off issues that women experience that men do not have to go through (and vice versa) so you cannot just say that the equal rights movement should ignore gender."
