The family I was living with used to clean houses for the band back in Jersey. The driver, Tico, even have them his pastor so the pastor would have a stable family that wasn't always on tour. Anyway, Tico gave our whole household (10 of us!) Tickets to the concert in Phoenix in '96 (we lived in southern CO at the time), as well as backstage passes. The concert was great. Bon Jovi was being a diva, though, and didn't honor the backstage passes. I moved out of that house soon after. I miss that family. But I especially miss Ollie (the parrot). In that house, he only liked Debbie... until I moved in. I loved that bird."

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fpfv9ky,t3_gd0xls,1588584809.0,"This happened in November 2009. I remember because it was shortly before my bout with meningitis. I was still married.

It was about 4 am and my husband got up to go to the bathroom. There was a crash and a bit of swearing. My husband had gotten a leg cramp which made him fall. He reached out for the wall and slammed his hand on the electrical outlet, breaking the cover and slicing his hand open. We couldn't stop the bleeding so we had to go to the hospital. That isn't the funny part.

We are in the ER in a curtained off space. My head was throbbing (because of the undiagnosed meningitis which I insist on bringing up though it has no bearing on this story) and my husband was bleeding. The doctor stepped out. An elderly woman was brought into the curtained ""room"" next to ours. The doctor asked what happened to her arm. She said ""well,I got up to go to the bathroom when my leg cramped up and I fell."" We suddenly felt a lot less silly having to go to the ER because he fell from a leg cramp. But really, what are the odds?"

10 years later, I chose to go to the hospital because I was actually going to succeed, had a plan, etc. 

He still reacted in anger and feigned concern when my psychiatrist (who I asked to send me to hospital) was around.

We are divorced now. Perhaps the people in your life will be more supportive. Doesn't sound like it. Thus, definitely not worth the effort. 

The hospital cared. The other ""residents"" cared because they were going through it too. I made friends there and in the intensive outpatient group therapy after. 8 years later, one of those friends is about to have twins! 

I guess my point is life can change. Going to the hospital is a better idea than failing suicide and gets the same results (or lack thereof) from friends and family and you'll meet people who understand what you are going through."
