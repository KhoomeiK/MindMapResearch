AskReddit,fpul92n,t3_gffps6,1588915911.0,"I was accused of stealing from walmart. It was probably around 2010 in highschool when my friends and i were out and about and decided to go to walmart to get some snacks. We had gotten only two bags of chips and afterwards decided to also go eat at the subway inside. As we were leaving, this old guy who looked like the old guy from the movie big daddy was standing by the entrance/exit asks us for a receipt. I had thought oh okay its either in the bag or my pocket but to my dismay after throughly checking it wasn't there. The old guy was convince even before I started looking for it we were thieves. But I had told him to wait just a minute, because we might have thrown it away in the trashcan at the in-store subway. So we search throughly again through the trash can to see if we can find the receipt but again it's not there. So the old guy radios the store manager who looks like this tweaked out ugly version of Ethan Hawk and he comes over looking all serious and makes us follow him into this small corner room with all these security monitors stacked up on each other showing all the floors and this fucker is 100% sure we did it and is telling us 15 year old kids he intends to press charges and keeps saying ""listen, I know you little shits did it, the police have been called, and we are going to press charges to the fullest extent."" At this point we're telling this dickhead, ""look dude, there's a whole wall of security monitors! Check the cameras!"" Of course he fucking ignores our requests as if the monitors probably weren't even recording anything to begin with. So by the time the police come and after about 20 to 30 minutes of back and forthing with this bald Ethan hawk looking asshat, the police finally come and are about to escort us to their patrol cars when, and I can't remember which one of us it was, thinks up the brilliant idea to look for the lady who rang us out. Of course the lady had already gone home by that time, but luckily the police had the store call her up and come back to the store. She verified that we had purchased those two bags of chips the asshole manager was so keen on ruining our lives over. Once the truth was out, we all literally said fuck you to the manger and were yelling at him for not listening and the cops had to calm us down. The stupid dweeb Ethan hawk looking manager then kept saying, ""look, I never said you guys 100% did it or didnt do it."" We were just so pissed at this point because prior to us being vindicated the slug of a manager shot down all our attempts to prove we didn't do it. After all was said and done, the cops just told us to leave and we did. We get back to my friends house and probably 5 hours later he looks in his pocket and finds the receipt."

I know that: [insert password] is your password!
I infected you with my private malware, RAT, (Remote Administration Tool) some time ago.
The malware gave me full access and control over your computer, I got access to all your accounts (see password above), it even was possible to turn your webcam on and spy on you.
I MADE A VIDEO showing you (through your webcam) STATISFYING YOURSELF and I collected all your private data.
After that I removed my malware to not leave any traces.
I can send this video to all your contacts (email, social network) and publish all your private data everywhere!
Only you can prevent me from doing this!
Transfer exactly 1600$ with the current bitcoin (BTC) price to my bitcoin address.
If you don’t know where to buy bitcoin, go to one of the most used exchanger: paxful.com ( there are over 300 ways to do it ).
Or Google: “How to buy Bitcoin”.
The wallet to send and receive bitcoin with the current rate you can create here: login.blockchain.com/en/#/signup/
Or you can simply send direct to my wallet from paxful.com.
My bitcoin address is:
Copy and paste my adress, it’s (cAsE-sensetive)
I give you 3 days to get the bitcoins and pay.
After receiving the payment, I will delete everything and we will forget everything, you never will hear from me again and you can live your life in peace like before.
BUT, if you simply ignore this email, I promise, I will turn your life into HELL, you know this all isn’t a joke and you will never forget the stupid decision you made!
Since I already have access to your computer, I know when you have read this email.
To make sure you don’t miss this email, I sent it multiple times.
Don’t share this email with anyone, as it only will make everything worse, they can’t help you with this, it should stay our little secret!"

So one day the latino kid goes up to my brother in class after a bit of back and forthing between the two of them and he starts throwing punches at my brother. Unfortunately for the latino kid my brother is pretty crazy and he had a pencil in his hand and stabbed the latino kid through he cheek.
