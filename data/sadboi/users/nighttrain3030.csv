antidepressants,fmpa627,t1_fmosmq9,1586277232.0,Oh calm down. “What is so hard to see about that?” You’re not paying attention. What is so hard is factoring in the likelihood of severe cognitive issues down the road. Physicians aren’t necessarily into fixing the present at the expense of your future. You’re underestimating the long term damage. The trained physician is not. “What is so hard to see about that?”
antidepressants,fmp9avy,t1_fmo8x15,1586276792.0,"It’s not that simple. Define “helpful.” The psychiatrist is likely trying to ensure better brain functioning down the road, which is perfectly health-focused. They aren’t refusing just to be a dick. Benzos are potentially very VERY bad long term. The doctor is aware of this and likely trying to do the best thing for the patient. Of course we, as patients, are far more consumed with the hear and now, which feels brutal. “Give me anything to fix the NOW!” However, Doctors have to also consider the long term impacts - at least the good ones do."
antidepressants,fmp8b27,t3_fwdo08,1586276285.0,"There is a currently a broad push to reduce benzo scripts due to more and more research showing bad long term cognitive impact. One day I came in and it was as if my doctor had just read new research and he’s like “uh yeah we need to stop this.” 

Your doctor is likely trying to protect you long term, which I would be grateful for. Sure, it’s very hard. Its crippling. Especially because of the duration you’ve been on it. But according to multiple docs I’ve had and recent research I’ve read, this could very well be the best thing for you/us. We gotta try to tackle this w/o the benzos if you want the ability to think and remember in 20 years. But you certainly have to taper down the right way..."
antidepressants,fmp5jjs,t3_fwlxmc,1586274831.0,"It’s good that you’re thinking this way and examining what you’re being prescribed. Good for you - keep it up. I was actually recently on a very similar cocktail. It’s really not a crazy amount of meds and I don’t see any crazy redundancy in there. Go to some med boards and check out other people’s cocktails and then you’ll feel a little better about that part :)

That said, I preferred to take fewer as well, and the first thing I ditched was Wellbutrin. It always has mixed reviews but does very little if anything for me. If you don’t feel the energy bump from that I might push back on that one with your MD. Might be totally useless. (Or maybe not!) Just be careful with overdoing it on the low energy piece. 60mg of Vyvanse is almost the max dose, so chasing more energy on top of that with more meds isn’t the best situation. One thing I struggled with was I could swear that my SSRI was impacting the efficacy of my stimulant/Vyvanse, which is very frustrating when you’re low energy and need more pep. Stims help my energy and motivation, but then SSRIs do the opposite. It’s a pickle."
depression,fm2vwhy,t3_fsg8zk,1585706641.0,"So difficult. I lost my 19 year old in November and cried for 3 days straight. It doesn’t necessarily feel great in the moment, but becoming a caretaker and focusing on giving your cat the best life possible at this stage can be incredibly rewarding. In the end I was giving my cat 8 pills a day, twice a day, every day. Frequent vet visits, huge bills, etc. I’m a super lazy person so it was a lot for me. The beginning of all the pills, etc was horrible. But I did it every day for over a year. It became our new bond, and eventually it felt like an enormous privilege to provide that care for him. I’m so grateful to have stuck with it all and to have shared that experience with him.

Be the greatest caretaker you can possibly be. It will be worth it."
antidepressants,fh5y5nt,t3_f1e4a4,1581293380.0,"Huh? He’s saying the Prozac will help the sexual dysfunction that the same Prozac is causing? I’m confused. Yes, IMO that would qualify as BS. If that were really the case, it wouldn’t be a secret. 

It can very likely cause sexual side effects. It may not. Everyone is different. I’ve read accounts that some actually like being able to ‘last longer,’ so it all depends. I automatically know that all the usual suspects will give me problems. It’s worth it for me. Sounds like it may not be worth it for you. At some point you may change your mind and it might be worth a test run."
antidepressants,fg4sv9u,t1_fg49tko,1580510369.0,"Have to disagree here. That’s awesome that your side effects diminished, but I can assure you that some side effects often remain throughout treatment for many people. 

But agreed that OP should hang in there. There’s no point in trying something for 3 days. Finding the right med(s) can be a veeery long process, and if things are bad enough, it’s well worth the effort.

This will ALWAYS come down to pros vs cons. Is it worth it, not worth it? For some, the depression is so bad that sexual dysfunction doesn’t matter at all. And for some it’s an absolute dealbreaker. But you won’t really know the pros and cons until you stick with a med for at least 6 weeks. 

At the end of the day, your depression will likely guide these decisions. You could decide it’s not worth it right now, and if your depression worsens over time (hopefully not the case), you may feel differently about it at some point. But again, 3 days isn’t telling you anything."
antidepressants,f9vcoea,t3_e71pyy,1575667460.0,Your doctor prescribed it because it’s a safe combo.
antidepressants,f8sm2e5,t3_e1rdqm,1574783976.0,"Depends what you consider to be a danger. I’m not aware of any serious physical dangers, but in my experience, weed can certainly interfere with the treatment, and make it difficult to know which meds are working for you and which are not (ie, ‘this doesnt seem to be working.  Is it the pot or does it just not work for me??’) Everyone is different of course - some might say it helps them. Just have a conversation with your doctor. For example, “Can you explain why I should abstain from marijuana use? If i were to smoke once per week, are there any serious dangers?”"
