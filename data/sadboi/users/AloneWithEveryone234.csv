There comes a point when you ask yourself is it all worth it. I'm all for staying around to help others, it's just i never have a moment that i enjoy myself. It can seem selfish, but i feel like I'm dragging down the ones that care about me as well as just living in constant agony of various varieties.


That said i am working through a bucket list and won't be doing anything silly in the near future. I haven't given up just yet. RIP to your friend i hope their soul has found the serenity they sought."

No amputated legs, that was just a rushed analogy. I have multiple debilitating physical ailments that have taken all the fun and opportunites out of my life. 

Sometimes i wish I was born like this as I've lived a very happy active healthy lifestyle before. Only to have it taken away. I think things may have been easier to handle if i didn't know any different."

Never been to this type of doc before. I'm trying really hard to make things better, it feels like all i do nowadays is try and self improve."

At some point though you have to ask yourself, is life meant to be endured or lived?

If you had a horse with 2 legs who dragged it's face around on the floor, at what point would it be considered cruel to keep it alive? When it first hits the ground, when you realise the legs won't grow back, when half its face is scraped off, when you can see its skull?


I realise you're trying to help and you care, but i am that mamed horse and i don't feel my legs growing back before my face falls off."

Me personally. I like having hot baths.

Training.

Soul food.

Watching my favourite show or documentary, i can't watch comedies, romances or family tv by myself though :(

SuicideWatch,f80iqlf,t1_f80hqkc,1574130006.0,"The other side of the coin is humility. Sometimes taking into account your blessings helps. Somedays for me the list is just one item long; I'm still here. 

I have to be grateful for that, the potential to turn things round may fade, but  hope remains, however fleeting. Life is built on moments. Collect enough postive ones and you begin to construct a world you can feel comfortable in.


The lifeline crisis are good for listening but  fall short when it comes to discussing issues. Have you spoken to your parents about this?"

SuicideWatch,f80hcnx,t1_f80g62n,1574129064.0,"I hear you. Clearly you're feeling a great deal of pain. Tears are a good release and a natural act of sadness, let them out, let them all out.
Forget your school work for now. I always found putting on my favourite TV show helped distract me from long enough to stop crying and focus my mind. Along with alot of deep breathing.

After years if crying every night i concluded that it wasn't going to get me anywhere. Eventually you'll have to look reality in the eye and think what can i do to make my life better?

On a postive note, if you're still young enough to be doing schoolwork then you have a great deal of opportunity left to improve things. 

Can i ask what's happened to get you feeling this way?"
SuicideWatch,f80g0bj,t3_dycg0f,1574128152.0,"God bless your soul. I know the feeling, I cried so long i went numb and couldn't cry anymore, today i felt the pain surface.

That's the main reason I'm still here, even though my parents helped massively in ruining my life and self worth, i just couldn't let them go through that level of pain. Me experiencing it is enough.

I've tried a range of professionals already as well as a number of alternative therapies. There's a few more doors to knock on. Today i just needed to write down my pains.

I think I'll be checking out sometime next year if nothing progresses.

Some people die years before they're buried. So finally biting the bullet won't be too difficult."

IncelsWithoutHate,esop85e,t1_esnmmfe,1562171913.0,"Good effort kid. You've got a great mindset. It's just you have not really had enough time away from mandatory social structures to truly understand loneliness. It amplifies day by day and can drive you mad at times. Eventually it will manifest in a range of health issues too and your world gets darker, the hole gets deeper and then the resignation and despair kick in. Its very hard to get out of a place like that.

People tend to shut down then its hard to relate to the Disney like undertones in your post bevause most people hsve tried to be positive for a long time with no avail. In fact that's probably why most of us are still here today. There's a reason for the saying ""It's the hope that kills you"". False hope just leads to disappointment and further depression and acceptance is even more difficult.

Anyway I'm rambling now. Just know your efforts are appreciated but just a little bit naive is all. Well that's my view atleast."
