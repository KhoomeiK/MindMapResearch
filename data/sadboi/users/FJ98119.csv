Anxiety,flo6r6d,t3_fpv8kj,1585332632.0,"I feel you. Really. I feel alone all the time. I have a great therapist, I am surrounded by family who I love, and who loves me, but with the amount of stuff that runs around my brain I can often only feel alone. Even though my family is as willing as anyone could be to offer help, I usually feel like they can't help me, so I simply never bring up the things that are actually troubling me when they see me looking somber. That's hard as hell. Part of me feels like unloading my true anxieties and fears onto them will help no one (especially because some fears like death are inevitable) but another, equally upset part of myself feels awful for hiding my true issues from them, and feels like if they were to suddenly die I would regret all I never explained. I don't know if my feelings of loneliness are similar to yours, or if this comes off as more of a rant, but this is just what I deal with and personally it helps me to hear other people's issues in detail. I often think the exact thing you are saying; ""there's only so much time before I can't handle this anymore"". The one thing I would say, to at least keep in mind, is that as time goes on you do get better at coping with anxiety. It doesn't always seem so, and for me it has been a ""3 steps forward 1 step back"" kind of process. That is to say I have setbacks all the time, but the longer you go on, the easier many things get, because you are making (albeit maybe small incremental) changes to your habits and thinking. There are times every single day when I feel hopelessly depressed, and anxious. It's been this way for maybe 4 or 5 years. I hope this doesn't sound too depressing, because my point is that you do make progress, just from having endured what you endure, and over time certain things do get easier. The fact that anyone withstands much of their life with disorder-level anxiety is a testament to their person, and is something to be considered. Every day you spend enduring makes the next day a little less difficult, even if you don't realize it.

On to one or two specific suggestions that may help:

Despite still being depressed and having anxiety, I surely spend less time in these states than I once did, and I have found some things which bring me joy and cause my anxiety to quiet down. I hate to get into the whole ""pickup a hobby"" thing, but I really have found that when I am engaged in something I enjoy (which often takes some time) fully, I am not anxious. Personally I love airplanes and engineering so I picked up scale modeling. It definitely takes some time before this new activity becomes satisfying as a hobby, as at first you probably won't be fully immersed. One of the reasons I've continued building model kits is that it gives me a level of mental immersion that in general, only things like a good movie or video game provide me with. For a long time I played way too many video games, and I will admit that I did so as relief, or more accurately, as an escape. I don't want to make it sound like the only way to deal with your anxiety is to occupy your mind, as alot of people see this as running from a problem, but I think that ""running"" is a small part of the solution. The times I get super immersed in my anxiety are almost always times where I am simply not occupying myself with anything. Sometimes while I'm in the middle of something I suddenly think, ""You're just doing this so your brain has no room for anxiety, but that doesn't change anything in the long-run"". It makes me feel like the things I spend my free time on are just an attempt to escape the ways I really feel, it can make a project I enthusiastically spent months on suddenly seem like it was a total waste of time. The reason I chose to explain all of this (which hopefully wasn't too confusing) is to show that life is not black and white and anxious thoughts often come down ""black and white thinking"". You feel awful at the moment. Almost subconsciously, it makes you think you will feel awful forever. This is not the case. Yes, I have been an anxious person since childhood, and have struggled with many of the same issues for a good portion of my life, (I'm 24) but over time, there  has been more and more time each day where I am able to pull myself out of my head so to speak and find some satisfaction in the day. Finally I'll say it is not easy to get interested or engaged in things when you are in a near constant state of anxiety but the more you are able to be present, and the more time you spend working towards some goal, the more likely you are to find some amount of satisfaction, or even possibly intrigue.

I hope this response wasn't too all-over-the-place, there are just a million different tips and thoughts I have about anxiety/I have learned with the help of therapy and I didn't want to bombard you with too many different ideas. (though I'm happy to share more tips if you want them) If you can afford to do it, please consider trying some therapy (personally I would recommend someone who specializes in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). I was hesitant to see a therapist initially but I would say it has probably done the most good for me between that, medication, and self research, especially when it comes to coping with anxiety."

Hulu,fj4pk1b,t3_f67r0w,1583013811.0,"So one of my biggest gripes with the UI (at least on Roku) is how many steps it takes to select a specific episode of a show from the main page. In case anyone doesn't know how to select a specific episode on Roku, the only way to do it is to play the show (which automatically resumes wherever you last were in that episode generally speaking) then pause, and from the pause menu select the ""start from beginning"" option (the one to the left of the pause button). Now the fact that selecting an episode, within a paid streaming service, needs to be explained to anyone who uses modern tech often is sufficient evidence that the Hulu UI is not very user friendly. While on PC you can choose to go to the ""details"" page before playing the content, but on Roku it's a nightmare. But I could maybe overlook this back when the UI was released. They presumably wanted feedback, so they could presumably fix at least a couple of the awful features, but the UI has barely changed since then (if I am missing some changes fill me in) and Hulu has gotten plenty of constructive criticism and feedback. You can search official Hulu forums and see hundreds of representatives giving the generic developer ""we have been notified of this issue and are actively working on it"" responses, some of them for the same exact issue years on end. I'm convinced Hulu is at a point of stagnation in their development, but unfortunately for the consumer, they have a lion's share of content so appealing that many of us stick around (myself included for now). I would love to see that Hulu, within the next few months, rolls out some sort of UI change, but I'm sort of losing hope with regards to that. I think the way Netflix does it makes so much more sense, where you are brought to a show page where you can choose an episode, choose to resume, or choose the next episode, before actually playing the content."

I know this probably isn't the type of pastime you are looking for but this method helped me, and may make you a better employee. What I found passed the time best, was just to keep in mind a list of all duties you do throughout the day/ that need to be done, and chip away at these things in your off-time. My advice may be more specific to the type of work environment this store had, in which there were a small handful of employees and two managers, with all employees having the same position. While our main job was to help customers find shoes to fit their needs (mostly serious runners and people with foot problems) there were also what I would call secondary tasks we were expected to do most days. Stuff like vacuuming the sales floor, pulling inventory for orders, cleaning the bathroom, making sure all the display shoes are oriented and tied correctly and cleaning the front windows. Given all these little things that most likely need to be done, the way I passed the time best was simply going from item to item (on the list) and doing whichever one has not been done. Again this advice may be more or less helpful depending on the size and type of work environment you find yourself in, but it worked for me.

I know with some of the OPT engines you can easily get to 35 or 40km with the right intakes, otherwise I'm never breaking 27km or so (in cruise)."
KerbalSpaceProgram,ffij9iw,t1_ffifh2m,1579975193.0,How many intakes are you using if you dont mind me asking?

KerbalSpaceProgram,ffifnoy,t1_ffifelx,1579972739.0,Even with the Whiplash or RAPIER and tons of intakes they only ever get me to 25 or 26km. Engines from OPT Spaceplane are another animal though.
KerbalSpaceProgram,ffifelx,t1_ffhxxzn,1579972565.0,With a stock engine? If that's a stock engine then cruising at 30km is sort of impressive.
commandandconquer,ffgchnh,t3_et6n8f,1579903187.0,I've been thinking of building the Zvezda MiG-1.44 and painting it like the Chinese MiGs. As far as i can tell they were basically modeled to look like that plane. EDIT: and also thinking of building a SCUD launcher done up in GLA colors.
commandandconquer,ffgc6jm,t1_ffg95kf,1579902999.0,I think that kit is still the only 1/72 Comanche kit that you can really find. I know the reason I bought it was because I could find no other options.

I'm not Italian, but if you go into an Italian restaurant in New York and ask for a wedge (in the NYC area wedge means subway sandwich or hoagie) topped with ""mot-sa-rell-a"" they might very well look at you like you've got two heads."

electronic_cigarette,fdrrtnn,t1_fdrkw7a,1578688809.0,This is really interesting and definitely helps my understanding of the PMTA.
electronic_cigarette,fdr7g0s,t3_emspjx,1578680572.0,"On top of the general bullshit of the anti-vaping movement it's such a shame that the fee for PMTA registration is prohibitively high. From my understanding, it can be literally 400,000 dollars just to register a single flavor, in one single PG/VG ratio, in one nic level. So it's no surprise that some of the awesome sites which used to carry an great array of flavors are going downhill. The one I personally think of is Vape Wild. They used to boast a wide array of flavors, with one of their selling points being a new flavor introduced each month. Now they seem to be slowly running out of stock, and keep removing their best flavors. I can only imagine the steep price of PMTA registration has something to do with situations like Vape Wild's."

ShroomID,fc62sp4,t1_fc60pa7,1577470980.0,"Often times species that grow on dead wood or species that are mycohorrizal (fungi that exchange nutrients with root systems and therefore grow alongside specific trees) will grow on the ground above wood or roots which are buried. H. fasiculare would be my first guess though a picture taken much closer to the cap (so we can see the texture not just the colors), a picture of the gills, along with one of the stem would help some. Several members of the genus Hypholoma look nearly identical to these, especially from this distance. 
To leave the least trace, cut one mushroom somewhere about a quarter of the way up its stem. Many species will simply regrow from the stub, because you didn't rip the mycelium at the base out of the ground (the mycelium is more or less the ""mind and body"" of the fungi while the mushrooms are simply the fruiting reproductive body)."
