RedDeer,fr0xfjf,t3_glx6t0,1589808971.0,It could be someone lost or something pulling in and checking there phone for directions or confirmation of something/making a phone call/spilled liquid on themselves and stopped to clean it up/dropped something on the floor that they need and assumed it was ok to pull into the driveway because it was so late.
CPTSD,fr03fty,t3_glmqkj,1589782596.0,"Same here. If I begin to feel like I‚Äôm not distracting myself, doing something, being entertained for like 20 minutes, my brain starts to eat itself. Sometimes it‚Äôs like 5 minutes."

nonmonogamy,fqsd92v,t3_gkjh08,1589604205.0,Red flag for me was when you suggested you close it up to work on your relationship with each other and he straight up said NO? Counseling is a great idea but I worry for you that with that he will still do things behind your back since he found no reason that would be an issue for HIM before.

nevergrewup,fq9gnni,t3_ghi4d6,1589197660.0,It‚Äôs called having arrested development and talk therapy can help you make more sense of things.
TooAfraidToAsk,fq8t8nz,t3_gh9q6r,1589174869.0,I think people want to be validated by their peers that they‚Äôre being ‚Äúso good so great‚Äù by posting stuff like that. Most people thrive off of validation like that. Likes on your post for your mom that might not even have social media? Addicting to some. It‚Äôs strange.

Doesn‚Äôt want to admit there is a problem and probably thinks she can handle more than she actually can on her own. I don‚Äôt know what country you‚Äôre in but, at minimum, if the BetterHelp app is available to you, see if she‚Äôd be open to trying that out on her own.
