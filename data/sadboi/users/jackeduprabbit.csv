Go to show someone the picture and it's a red bird?? But it had to have been blue, that was such a cool part! However there is evidence in front of you now that the bird is red.

Of course, the times we did safeword, she was completely untied, but after we were reset, I would burrito her into blankets, because that is what she liked.
