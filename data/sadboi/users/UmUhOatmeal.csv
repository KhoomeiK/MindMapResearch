asktransgender,fm2ger2,t3_fse9cu,1585696962.0,"As well as contacting the news, contact the patient’s rights advocate. When I was in an in-patient ( fellow Californian) they took my packet, tried to take my binder, and were extremely condescending about all of my trans related issues, but after writing a grievance form and calling the advocate they cracked down on a lot of the transphobic actions of the staff. They will take you extremely seriously as they know how shitty healthcare workers can be to patients and are there to make things right. 

A good note for anyone else: while you are in there they legally cannot refuse your request to write a grievance form and you are allowed to call at any time the phone is available. They may or may not pick up, but most are always on top of their messages and don’t be afraid to call multiple times if you don’t get a call back. With grievance forms the workers legally are not allowed to read it or tamper with the letter in any way. Be as detailed as you can and don’t be afraid to use the front and back of that paper. Name names if you have to. They will listen and they will care. They are there for you and on your team. Don’t let it get in your head that “ I might be discharged soon so why bother” either. I thought the same thing, but filled it out anyways. Changes didn’t happen during my stay, but after I was readmitted the next month and they had a whole procedure for trans patients at that point and actually minded their business about my packer. 

Sorry for that rambling at the end I just really want y’all to know. Know your options and don’t be afraid to reach out to the advocates in your area. They usually have it in the stack of papers you’re given or tell you, but to be safe it’s always good to know it before you even step foot in the hospital."

Pack a little further back (between the legs slightly) since if you pack to forward it may be a little awkward. I found with STPs it’s most comfortable to pack with it in the position I hold it to pee, and a jockstrap can keep it from pushing forward as you walk. I’ve had 5 different pairs of packing underwear and none of them have been as comfortable as a plain jockstrap. It also will hold it where the average anatomy would be since that’s what it’s designed for, compared to packing underwear which is more to specifically hold the pack."
