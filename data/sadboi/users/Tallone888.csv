SuicideWatch,fn993xj,t3_fpn7fr,1586763849.0,"Im really starting to obsess about how Im going to hang myself , I wish I had the guts to do it ,but it feels so selfish on the people I leave behind ,but then I think they are better off without my moods and using drugs they would be releived that Im not here . It seems to get harder as I get older . Im really dreading coming off the herion ,The pain and mental obsession and having to wait 6 weeks to get into detox is hard to hear unless you have health insurnace or willing to pay 5 grand to get into asap is really hard ,that's just makes killing myself more of an option."

depression,flw163l,t3_fcjtbe,1585537005.0,"Just think it could be worse ,You could be addicted to heroin have a family to support no work ,no money for food having to steal and pawn everything you have to support habit and food smashed your car waiting on a court case that could end up in jail and also suffer from depression and anxiety . So your life isnt' that bad . Just think how much worse it could be . And know in Australia we are in lock down and have to stay indoors or be arrested , So your life isnt that bad."

SuicideWatch,flq0xq5,t3_fpn7fr,1585374999.0,"Wow ! I thought I was alone thinking that it gives me peace that I can end it.  
Im a heroin addict and sick of tired of using and Im thinking about ending it . Its caused so much pain in my life not just mine but my family . Ive never felt so suicidal in my life . I can end it with just a big dose of my choice of drug ,but its who I leave behind that stops me ,but even that thought is over riding committing the end . 

I felt like this since I was 8 years of age and been battling it for many years and its wearing me down."
