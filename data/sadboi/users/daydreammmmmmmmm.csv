I had a somewhat similar experience when I was little except I am a girl. I had some memories but other things seemed to be ‚Äúblocked out‚Äù of my memory for a long time. I knew something was wrong and had lots of nightmares and then ended up coping by numbing out for a long time in various self destructive ways. Eventually I did some EMDR and other types of trauma therapy and some of the missing memories started coming back to me. I still think there are things I don‚Äôt remember, but I have started to process things finally. But at the end of the day, the trauma still affects my life in many ways and I still have a long way to go.

I hope you can find some healing and peace. Therapy helps, but it takes time and a good therapist.

I understand your feeling of loneliness. I have felt that way many, many times. I used to hate the idea of paying someone to talk to me about my issues and my life. It felt pathetic. 

But then I realized that in order to heal and grow into someone who is able to cultivate and nurture real, IRL relationships of all kinds, I had to have professional help from someone who was trained and educated on how to help me. So I gave therapy an honest shot, and I tried several before finding the one that finally clicked. He understands me and is so nonjudgmental and I am enormously grateful that I pushed through
those early feelings enough to give myself this chance to heal. I had to have this kind of support before I was healthy enough to find real life relationships. 

The money/insurance thing is a big problem too, I understand. Back when I was uninsured, I had to scrape pennies to afford therapy on top of my other bills. But I made it a priority and found some people who have a sliding scale so that it is more affordable. Of course I believe everyone should have access to affordable (universal) health insurance and mental healthcare in this country, but that‚Äôs another post for another day... lol

When you notice it, set a timer for 2-3 minutes and take deep breaths for the entire time, resisting the urge to bite. Sort of like a mini meditation. After the time is up, the urge may have passed. Try to do this several times a day and just keep resisting the urges. Or you can squeeze something when you have the urge, or rub some lotion into your hands, or do anything else with them besides biting them. Over time, you will be able to break the habit.

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve had good results with this treatment but I do want to voice a concern here because I care about you and other people on this forum, and I think that it is potentially irresponsible to post this without explaining the risks of kratom. I am saying all of this from first hand experience. 

Kratom is an opioid agonist. That means that like heroin and oxycodone, etc it can be highly addictive. 

‚ÄúLike other drugs with opioid-like effects, kratom might cause dependence, which means users will feel physical withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking the drug. Some users have reported becoming addicted to kratom. Withdrawal symptoms include:

muscle aches
insomnia
irritability
hostility
aggression
emotional changes
runny nose
jerky movements‚Äù
and many more... 

The dependency and addiction component sneaks up on you with kratom. Withdrawal can be an absolute nightmare. Until you‚Äôve experienced opioid withdrawal you just can‚Äôt imagine. And you don‚Äôt want to. Please do your research and educate yourself on the risks before you choose this as a viable treatment for BPD.

Addiction is a disease and doctors are supposed to help. I have struggled badly with addiction and have had various forms of psychiatric treatment for it, so feel free to DM me if you have questions about my experiences.

As for the other stuff, I would approach things with caution during the first appointment and feel it out. After you‚Äôve built up some trust with the doctor you can definitely discuss thoughts you‚Äôre having and ask for their feedback. You can also state on the first appt that you struggle with lack of empathy as a symptom. That is a symptom for several disorders (as you‚Äôre aware) and your doctor will be familiar with it. 

I haven‚Äôt ever struggled with thoughts of hurting anyone else, but have struggled with suicidal thoughts. I haven‚Äôt expressed intent to follow through on my thoughts with a psychiatrist, but I was involuntarily committed once very briefly when I expressed suicidal intent to my boyfriend in passing and he called the cops. They had to take me in for evaluation (via the back of a cop car, handcuffed) and it sucked. By the time I got to speak to the doctor there, I was fine and no longer feeling suicidal so they let me leave after 1 night.

That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to stop using opioids without medical treatment/support on the front end, regardless of how much I was paid.

I was curious if they provided that kind of support to the participants before beginning this study, because I highly doubt $8/hr could get someone through detox.

It‚Äôs an insane way to live! I can never relax or just feel at peace with who I am. I am trying to forgive myself when I make mistakes and remember that I am doing the best I can."
BPD,flv78dm,t3_fraf2p,1585517841.0,"Yes. I feel panic levels of anxiety every single day and want to die. Nothing helps. I am desperate to get the courage to kill myself, but I keep thinking about the sadness it might cause to my loved ones so I don‚Äôt do it. Then I end up choosing the lesser of two evils and drinking or doing drugs or hurting myself in some other way to numb out enough to not kill myself and continue living. And then my family members are upset or disappointed in me anyway. So logically, I‚Äôm already disappointing/upsetting them anyway, so killing myself wouldnt be that big of a change, right? Maybe that is insane, but I literally think everyone would be better off and while it would be painful at first we would all be spared a lifetime of sustained misery."
BPD,flv6qlk,t3_framg2,1585517541.0,"YES. I literally plot an ‚Äúescape‚Äù from everything at least once a week where I start planning how to quit my job, leave my partner, move out of state, and start completely over somewhere else, completely anonymously. It hasn‚Äôt happened yet but I am hoping to get the guts to actually do it soon."
BPD,flt169o,t3_fqxrpx,1585456215.0,I understand this so well...
Coronavirus,flsrgbf,t1_flrnxee,1585448952.0,"if you think addiction is a choice, you are seriously mistaken."
BPD,fl2ucap,t1_fl2qm7k,1584760128.0,"Yeah. To me, experiencing sustained remission would be just as good as a cure. It‚Äôs unlikely that will happen for me, but it‚Äôs something to hope for, I guess."
BPD,fl2qc89,t1_fl1xtus,1584757230.0,"Many, many people, through hard work and years of treatment and therapy, medication, etc. experience sustained remission from this disorder. It takes time and work, but it‚Äôs possible."
BPD,fl25wh1,t1_fl22orw,1584743647.0,"Thank you for this! I honestly think this is a troll from the ‚Äúother BPD subreddit‚Äù who is trying to stir things up. Probably not someone we need to pay any mind to. Either that, or they have been misdiagnosed and do not have BPD (but rather a disorder with a criteria that involves lack of empathy). Just my theory.

Thank you for your kindness and empathy - and for fighting that very BPD urge to engage in black or white thinking. Your perspective is so very appreciated and you are someone that we can all learn and grow from! Cheers"
BPD,fl250qw,t1_fl230km,1584743084.0,"Look. I am sorry if you‚Äôve been cheated on, and that is the source of your fierce anger. No one deserves to be cheated on, and no one on this thread has justified the act of cheating or said that it is okay. But I also know that very few, if ANY people who cheat (aside from true sociopaths) want to harm someone else through their actions. Most of the time, it is a form of self harm or a fear based response to pain and trauma and despair. A desperate shot in the dark for validation. Something more complex than ‚Äúwanting to cause harm or violate values.‚Äù Something far less vicious and premeditated than the picture you are painting. Something human and real. 

I truly hope you can read up on empathy and learn how to see the possibility of someone else‚Äôs trauma response being beyond and different from your own personal experience. You are not the center of the universe (neither am I, neither is anyone), and your experience, while not unique, is not the same as everyone else‚Äôs. You only have access to your own mind and heart and no one else‚Äôs. Stop with the grandiosity and self importance. Stop with the belief that you are omnipotent and all knowing. Your ego needs a reality check. The world is diverse and complex, my friend. Avoid black or white thinking.(And check out DBT for more on that, it helps)."
BPD,fl1z7rk,t3_fm12by,1584739418.0,"I don‚Äôt imagine people missing me or anything after the actual suicide, but every single day I imagine dying and the peace and relief I would
feel from no longer having to suffer."
BPD,fl1jil8,t1_fkzk8fx,1584730245.0,"I take issue with this. The thing about BPD (and complex PTSD - which is basically what BPD is) is that there is not ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù in terms of people‚Äôs reactions to trauma. Everyone responds differently to the trauma and pain they have experienced. It is better not to judge people whose situation you do not know or understand. Trauma is hard enough, and I think one of the best things we can do on this forum is be open minded enough to know that trauma affects people in different ways and that our singular experience shouldn‚Äôt be generalized to place judgment on others who are suffering or to make assumptions about weak moral character. Being condescending and judgmental isn‚Äôt attractive, and I am sure I‚Äôm not the only one who will say that it isn‚Äôt welcome here on this forum. 

Trauma and BPD make people lose sight of reality and behave in harmful ways. And BPD people are highly sensitive and experience profound remorse and shame when they behave in harmful ways. They do not lack empathy nor are they sociopathic as you seem to imply. Let‚Äôs not lose sight of that. 

I am happy for you that you haven‚Äôt been faced with a situation where your reaction was to cheat. Good on you. If you do have BPD, I am almost certain that you *maybe at least once in your entire life* have made a mistake where you violated one of your own values. Unless of course you are a perfect person (who also has BPD - wow!) If you are such a thing, I would love to learn more from you. 

Spread kindness and love. Remember that everyone is suffering and everyone‚Äôs response to suffering manifests in different ways. Many loving, loyal, and committed human beings (with or without BPD) make mistakes."
BPD,fkz89mq,t3_flfqp1,1584665022.0,"That‚Äôs so great. I‚Äôm glad it helped you! I love baths too, nothing calms me down like a warm bath."
BPD,fkt8esp,t3_fkkb74,1584509512.0,"I try to do something (even something really small) that makes me feel good about myself or proud of myself. I try to replace the feeling of being wanted with wanting myself to do something that will help me or make me feel good. It doesn‚Äôt always work, of course. But it serves as a good distraction sometimes and helps me get through those awful feelings instead of acting out impulsively. Hope that made some sense. Wishing you the best!"
BPD,fksmdga,t3_fk7ar6,1584493354.0,"Damn, I thought this same exact thing last night. I am honestly so exhausted from living but I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone by killing myself. I know it‚Äôs awful to wish for something like this when so many people who want to live are getting it, but the thought did cross my mind. 

I hope you feel better soon. Maybe things will change and improve for you. I sure hope so, keep going and keep trying. üíõ"
BPD,fkpcyzm,t1_fkope9j,1584407178.0,I‚Äôm definitely going to check these out! Thanks for the suggestions.
BPDrecovery,fkpcrl5,t3_fjnzvj,1584407040.0,"My partner. He is the only person who has truly accepted and loved me for who I am and has never given up in trying to understand this disorder and the way my mind works. He always keeps trying with me, and that means so much.

Also, my cats. :)"
BPD,fkpcaij,t3_fjs14r,1584406723.0,Thank you for taking the time to write and share this. It means a lot to know that people out there are compassionate and understanding.
BPD,fkimc8a,t3_fioqmx,1584223401.0,"I love Dr. Fox! He has such amazing insights and seems like a truly compassionate individual. I have learned a lot about my condition from him. He has a great BPD Workbook as well that can be ordered on Amazon. 

(His videos also have really cheesy clip art which makes me smile üòÇ)"
BPDrecovery,fkfuhz3,t3_fi5rdx,1584142839.0,"Please please please hang on! I know these feeling sooo well, there is nothing worse. It is almost unbearable. But please don‚Äôt give up. Your life is so valuable. As someone else mentioned, another doctor or a hospital might be able to help you with a few days worth of your medications if you explain the situation. I am so sorry you‚Äôre in this mess. I wish I could do something to help. Just please don‚Äôt die, please continue to live! Try to do something to distract yourself if you can- a good movie or working on a project or anything really. Just buy yourself enough time til you can sleep. I promise it will get better!! Sending you love and strength."
