SkincareAddiction,fpkjdum,t1_fpkb6l6,1588695742.0,"I would definitely add salicylic acid. I can get those time from time but when I do I use Stridex in the red box in the morning. Leave on for 5 minutes then rinse off. They are gone by the next day. Also you should switch to using your Vitamin C to the morning before your moisturizer. 
Then at night take out the lactic acid and add retin a like tretnoin or some retinol product. Lactic acid does not work for everyone. In fact it made my skin worse anytime I’ve tried. 
Lastly, a foaming cleanser can be super drying which leads to more closed comedones. Try Vanicream or a cream cleanser. I use Vanicream. 
My skin is pretty much clear now and my forehead used to be covered in closed comedones."

dating_advice,erg2m30,t1_erg1sp8,1560824639.0,Thank you! Not wanting a relationship or anything serious is something he should have told you before you hooked up.
dating_advice,erg0mod,t3_c1w0ms,1560823045.0,"I don’t think the question is why. I think you have to take what he said for face value. This is a guy you’ve hung out with, been intimate with and his reaction is to become distant. Do you want to be with someone who does this? I find with my ex he  was like this and I necessarily did not want a relationship so I was ok with it. Then finally we both wanted a relationship and dated. However when things got serious or we’re going good he would sabotage our relationship like randomly stay out all night without telling me where he is or answering a text. Well, I later found out he cheated on me and we never became engaged like he said we would. 
TL:DR I was in a relationship with a guy like this. Pursued me hard. After we hooked up things got weird. I wish I had listened to him when he said he didn’t want a relationship because he really didn’t and I wasted three years of my life."
dating_advice,era3m9d,t1_er9sxnw,1560635308.0,Definitely not a troll. I only said this because it has happened to me. I’ve gone on dates only to realize I don’t really like this guy that much. So it’s side hug etc. Then if he stops contacting me I would feel like “why did he stop? He should still be trying to contact me” lol. I know it’s hypocritical but rejection is really a trigger for some. I used to be like this. But it helped me realize when someone likes you you know it. The chemistry etc. and if you have to wonder 99% they don’t or it’s not enough to sustain an actual relationship. Just my two cents.
dating_advice,er9rve6,t1_er9qpb9,1560628755.0,"You should be very concerned and drop her. Don’t call or text her. It’s human ego that she will wonder why YOU are not contacting her and then she’ll treat you differently. I’m a girl. I know this for a fact. Doesn’t seem like she was that much into you. Maybe she thinks you’re too nice, friend zone etc."
depression,er9398v,t3_brsy1y,1560616441.0,Yes! All the time. I have good days and bad days. But the bad days far outnumber the good ones.
