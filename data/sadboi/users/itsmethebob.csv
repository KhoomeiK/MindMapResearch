You can't track animals you can just run after them and pray you find them when they die. I wouldn't recommend using a spear for this (especially not an obsidian one like another commenter suggested) because if they run off and you can't find them there goes your spear. I always use bow and arrow, because then worst case you lose an arrow, big deal. And they do the same damage if you get a headshot (=instant death). 

And yes, soup works, get half a coconut, put it on your fire, fill it up with water and dump something in there. Soup is great because it doesn't go bad afaik."
