Someone on the special effects team or did they outsource it to someone maybe?"

horror,flvf6ya,t1_flv7fmc,1585522528.0,"I dunno, seems better to watch the version that's most approved by the director.

You only see a film for the first time once. 

For instance I'm so glad I saw the final cut of Blade Runner rather than the theatrical release.

Then again you also get George Lucas releasing his crappy re-releases of Star Wars haha

Though what's different with films like Nightbreed is that the original vision of the director was held back by the studio in the theatrical release."
horror,flus8e7,t1_flur7k3,1585508951.0,"Thanks for the recommendations!

Candyman is on my watch list, didn't even realise it had anything to do with Clive Barker haha

Also interested in Midnight meat train purely on the basis that it has Vinnie Jones in it (i'm from england and have a morbid fascination in how bizarre he is as a person).

Been thinking of playing Jericho as well, had no idea about Undying though, sound interesting."
horror,fluql5a,t1_flup3va,1585507966.0,"yeah the Director's cut is the one approved by Clive Barker so probably watch that.

The cable cut has more scenes, bringing the film up to 2 and a half hours; I think there's even a new one set to release that's 3 hours? But I've heard it's not a finalised project, in that some of the scenes aren't up to the scratch to the rest of the film, because of audio or picture quality.

Director's cut seems the one to watch as a newbie."

BPD,et62iiy,t1_et61t4n,1562501891.0,"No worries :)

I do empathise with having a mom that's self absorbed and doesn't understand mental health, who thinks that you can just turn it off with a switch.

It sounds like she was being out of order, though again I can't accurately say having not been there. It sounds like it she said some stuff in the moment without thinking as well. That doesn't excuse being emotionally manipulative though.

Good luck with working things out, families are incredibly difficult sometimes!"
BPD,et61j92,t3_ca3hye,1562500914.0,"I think it's worth stating that we can't give a fair deduction of the situation, not knowing you at all, having not been there.

Having said that, the fact she called you a failure is pretty out of order. That in itself sounds somewhat emotionally manipulative.

 Also, it sounds like it should be evident to her that you're going through a rough time.

Ultimately what I will say, is that families can be hugely dysfunctional. So whilst you may be looking for whether your actions were justifiable, or right or wrong, the same could be questioned of your mother.

It's hard to say with families, as they can be both complicated and triggering. It your boyfriend knows you well I'd consider his opinion. Otherwise maybe some kind of therapist could help you work through such thoughts? Sorry I can't give you a more linear answer. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
BPD,epxw7x9,t3_bwitke,1559612507.0,"Hey man, please don't make this decision. It might seem appealing now but it's the worst decision you can make.

I know how hard getting over a relationship can be, especially when you feel emotionally vulnerable and lacking in support.

But I promise you it will get easier. I'd say it's fairly normal to still feel grief 3 months after breaking up. This is just part of your grieving process. Every day you work yourself towards feeling better though!

When I broke up with my ex back in October, I thought my life was over as well. But for the past couple of months I've only thought of her a couple of times.

Stay strong, and maybe think about getting counselling or seeing a doctor. Even just phoning a friend or family member.

If things really are feeling bleak, I urge you to call a suicide hotline. I know everything is scary rn, but the fact you posted this on here shows you want to get better. 

Good luck
