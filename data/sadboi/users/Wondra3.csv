I got mad respect for people that can recognize the importance of respecting an animals signals and boundaries, and showing them love in the way that makes them feel safe, and not just obsessively trying to pet/handle them. 

I'm glad you two have found such happiness together 游뗵"

Found out that I'm super codependent, even with strangers, and my desire to ""fix"" other people's problems was actually coming from a place where I determined my own self worth based on ""saving"" people. Not that it's a bad thing to want to help others, I still like to do good, but I have zero desire to be a hero now. I'm much healthier and happier this way"

MultipleSclerosis,eremtnu,t3_c1nl1f,1560788001.0,"Potato or not, you have a great heart. And to me, that is the most valuable thing to bring to the table as a supportive partner.

The thing with MS is that it's different for everyone. Read up on the symptoms so that you're familiar with them, and then let her tell you how her MS effects her. And also understand that the symptoms she has now could be different than the symptoms that effect her later down the road, even a week from now. So it will need to be an ongoing conversation between you two on what she's experiencing and how you can best help/support her. 

Something that helped my SO was the ""MS for Dummies"" book. It gives a lot of information without getting too clinical and wordy.

The other most important thing is to BELIEVE HER when she says she's experiencing symptoms. So much of MS is invisible when looking at a person. And it can be really easy to not take something she says very seriously when she doesn't ""look sick"". But trust her. And I'm not saying this because I don't think you take her seriously, because it's quite obvious that you care for her very much. I just want to make sure you have a heads up that it's easy to not believe there's a fire if you can't see the flames or smell the smoke. So just keep an eye out for that :)

Sending love and light to the two of you 游눞"
