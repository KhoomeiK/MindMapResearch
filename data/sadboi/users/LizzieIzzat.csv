I also had the option of living with my boyfriend this year, if you're not ready, don't do it. The last thing you want is to regret that and be stuck in a contract you can't get out of easily. I'm sure he can definetely find a new housemate, I've never known anyone to have too much of an issue? But I don't know, are there any Facebook pages he can search on?

It's okay and Healthy to feel independant and have that space for yourself in a relationship. It's a factor that's super important in my opinion. If you like him and enjoy being with him and he gives you space to be you and do your own thing that then I'd say keep him around for as long as you're happy with because that sounds like a nice dynamic to me"

I've always tried to make myself feel like they can come to me for emotional problems. To hear some people haven't been treated at all with that humane respect and also have had so many people walk away from their issues as a man, upsets me (not that I didn't realise it was an issue, because I did).

You don't learn a fluent language in a few months, same thing applies to data science, coding etc.

One thing I've learnt in my university studies from being a bit of a perfectionist is to try to acknowledge what you have achieved already, and also not be too hard on yourself (as hard as it is). Mistakes are part of the process, this is something that you're just going to have to slowly face and overcome and know that mistakes are a way forward to self development and improvement, and not a sign of failure or incompetency. I can relate to this though, as often when I struggle with something it makes me feel that 'maybe it's not for me' but I just keep on pushing through.

unpopularopinion,fmq9s8t,t1_fmpfgb5,1586295563.0,"And i was a teenage girl 4 years ago, I think I would know... Also I think you'd find young people are much more influenced by the media, and things they watch / are exposed to than you think. We shouldn't stop kids having sex, sure, but we should encourage healthy approaches to it. 

If you read my replies you'd know I agree that there shouldn't be sexual taboos and teens need information. Some teen tv shows do this well, others such as sabrina and riverdale don't and promote harmful expectations/ideals of sex and sexual objectification. That is literally all I am saying. 

and I mean legistically speaking it is child sexualisation if you look at it in an objective way. Sure, I admit I should've been more specific, but they are classified as children and are OVER-sexualised which is an issue. There is a difference between 'yeah teens have sex thats normal and chill' and occasionally showing that plot and over-sexualising it to an excessive degree."
unpopularopinion,fmpc7yp,t1_fmpaona,1586278250.0,"But it encourages a lot of young people to think that they NEED to have sex. When they don't. It's okay to be a teenager and not have sex. There's so much pressure nowadays for teens with social media, appearance, body image, sex. All that needs to be sensitively addressed. 

The oversexualisation is not about pedophilia it's about the sexual messages that are put out in shows like this to these age groups, especially for really young viewers. Some teen shows do it well, those aren't the issue here."
unpopularopinion,fmp9yho,t1_fmp87b5,1586277127.0,"Well watch the show and come back after 

There are equally loads of teens out there who aren't all interested in sex. 

There's more to being a teen than sex. The characters are made out to be 2 dimensional beings who are just there to get laid. Why? It's a shit show in general after the second season

In comparison, sex education, deals with different topics like consent, sexual assault, kinks, amongst other things, not always in a happy cheery way. But the girl and guy characters aren't just sexual objects of desire they actually have personalities and have depth to them.

I just wish the writers explored these topics in a more thoughtful way. One that would be more impactful on the teenage audience."
unpopularopinion,fmp8lws,t1_fmp2109,1586276440.0,"Well legally they are. I also work with them, and although we call them 'young adults' which is the more appropriate term to be fair, they always think they know more than they do and are more mature than they are.

Obviously there are a few very mature teens, and some adults who are very immature equally.

Heck, I thought I was super mature for my age at 15, and in some ways I was, but looking back a few years later I realise how young and naive I was, and impressionable. 

Also, when you hear stories of a adult dating a 16 yearold most people aren't like 'eh that's fine no biggy you're basically an adult when you're 16 anyways' because the maturity gap would be so wide."
unpopularopinion,fmp7veq,t1_fmp7h5d,1586276064.0,"People are misinterpreting what I and others are saying. It's not that sex shouldn't be shown to teens in the media because it SHOULD and sex education is extremely important.

Some shows do it well, some don't. But a lot of really young viewers now watch these shows and they have a responsibility to put out good role models.

Its kinda like how abusive and toxic relationships in teen dramas are so normalised. Yes it is a college setting but it appeals to a younger audience for sure. Like in the movie 'after' the books are just toxic and abusive behaviour. I work with 15-17 yearolds and they LOVE the movie and the relationship dynamic and think it's romantic. What's that showing anyone about what a good healthy relationship is?"
unpopularopinion,fmp7h5d,t1_fmozmry,1586275859.0,"Of course there are teenagers who would fantasise about that kind of stuff, but that doesn't mean it should be in a teens TV show in the way it is portrayed. 

You wouldn't be able to get a 16 yearold actor and get them to pretend to be whipped by bdsm sex demons on TV because its not allowed. Instead they get adults to play the parts. It just makes zero sense.

Bottom line is, it's a TV show that like riverdale, places way too much of an emphasis on sex and the sexual objectification of these 'teenagers'. As someone literally said above people as young as 12/13 or even younger are watching this shit thinking its some show about just a teen witch and bam some dudes being knocked around in a cage being whipped by sex demons and is using it as a way of punishing himself (which isn't even an accurate representation of bdsm culture anyways).

There's already a massive pressure surrounding having sex etc that young people experience nowadays, sure, there should be open dialogue and honesty about what it is etc. But the media controls a lot, and the way sex and whatever is approached in these TV shows is careless and thrown about as if its nothing and something you are expected / have to have."

The problem is OVERsexualisation, if you listen to why people are uncomfortable. The characters being portrayed as sexual objects and can go around fucking whoever they want, is not healthy.

For example, a show like sex education. Right. Great show, about sex. But it explores it in a healthy way, in a more realistic way and explores the not so pretty things to about it and the struggles a lot of teens go through revolving their sexual identities. The characters aren't just sexual beings, they have much deeper and developed personalities and goals and aspirations and relationships."
unpopularopinion,fmohaar,t1_fmoh4qu,1586258934.0,"Also it's weird for adults who watch this show. As the people are of age and attractive, it's then weird to be fantasising over a 15 yearold character??

Inside I was dealing with so much anxiety, low self esteem, depression and self doubt and no one could see it as people assume you must be thriving in order to be 'successful'. Its only been the last year or so that I've acknowledged perfectionism isn't good, yet its a deeply troubles and dibilitating symptom that holds you back from enjoying life and even thriving as you should.

I mean, I completely understand he might be annoyed by some fan accounts and feel intruded on. Yet if that's the case, why be an actor? Part of your job is interacting with fans and obviously he is going to have young girls crushing on him. I think it's something he doesn't really want to accept."

I forgot to add that I can't afford lessons (neither me or my parents). I'm a student and can barely afford rent so that's out of the question. 

I have tried to reach out to some people at University but the music scene there is a bit lacking. Singing is more so my passion, so I would like to get better at just fundamental guitar / finger-style techniques before I consider arranging my own music or performing or whatever it is. Not to say I don't care about guitar (because I do and I enjoy it), but I've never really had anyone 'help' me as such, so to my knowledge is pretty poor on the matter.

I wouldn't say I'm a beginner, maybe low intermediate? I don't really know how to express my level without showing to be honest. I was more just looking for some good video recommendations or tutorials or books or whatever to develop my fingerstyle techniques and get into rhythm guitar."
Anne,fm56ii2,t1_fm55v4s,1585767231.0,"Yeah I know, it wouldn't be the same. Especially when they spent three seasons building up to it! On the show Gilbert and Anne have a very good chemistry. I think he is also pretty young (he is only 19 in real life I believe) and so maybe hasn't quite got the best method to deal with this maturely. If you look at his social medias, theres barely anything at all to do with the show, no promotion, barely any pictures with co-stars etc. Quite strange for someone who has been in three seasons of a success-full Netflix show which to me shows maybe he wants to distance himself from the role?

My lashing out, however it was done, has always been something that has hung over my head with guilt and shame over how I have treated those I love out of pure rage and impulsivity. I have learnt not to beat myself up about it as much, to take accountability and to realise my issues were not 'me'.

It was something for a long time I didn't think I would get under control. What I have realised though is that a lot of my anger is caused by criticism, or feeling inferior to people, due to deeply ingrained perfectionist tendancies in me. Anything like rejection, even constructive criticism hurt like hell. They still do sometimes, but when I feel the same rage I once felt over things that ultimately don't matter, I just have to sit it out. Breathe. Experience what I'm experiencing. I've had quite a lot of counselling as well to help and that has been good.

I think it's pretty normal in this case. I usually have it happen when I get a resurgence of feeling that my experiences are not validated. 

The unfortunate thing about having any sort of mental or even physical health problem, is that sometimes it always feels like a race for who is sickest. You know that you would absolutely hate to have it worse than you do, but you almost feel like a fraud for feeling like you do in your circumstances as you don't have it 'bad' enough to justify your emotions.

unpopularopinion,fhsrzkf,t1_fhsqai4,1581864551.0,"I think the issue OP is talking about more is how it's so normalised to be such a regular and expected thing. I'm at university and throughout my time I've felt the pressure and seen the pressure other people put on drinking. I've been to socials where my friends are being pressured to keep drinking. Why?

Every now and then I see a group of friends who I adore, but a lot of them just want to get hammered. A lot of people can't seem to understand that some people aren't into this, and not wanting to drink alcohol can feel incredibly isolating socially and can make you feel very judged as 'boring' by others.

Sure, drinking can be fun, but the complete reliance it seems on binge drinking to have fun is a bit excessive imo. As a student, it's ridiculously expensive for such a normalised thing, and also sometimes it's just nice to spend time with friends at a coffee shop, having movie and games nights and just hanging out without getting off your face. I dated someone once who all he wanted to do is go out and get wasted and that was how he socialised and I just couldn't imagine doing that (he was also always broke, wonder why....)"

relationship_advice,fh7kphm,t3_f1ld45,1581336278.0,"This is something I did when I was younger and too emotionally immature to be in a relationship to be honest (I had a lot of emotional issues I hadn't worked through and didn't know how to juggle a relationship). I also have ADHD and didn't know which made me act impulsively and I struggled to control my anger. 

On one hand I can kind of empathise with your boyfriend, not that his actions were acceptable. He is clearly either too immature emotionally to handle to complexities of a grown ass relationship and/or he needs some counselling or help or something in order to learn to control his behaviour.

I think really you have two ways to go about it, either sit him down and make it clear that unless he changes, makes an effort to overcome whatever is causing him to act like this and make a conscious effort to communicate better (maybe even some relationship counselling?), the relationship is done.

Or you could just straight up dump him if you don't think the relationship is worth saving.

When I first started dating my boyfriend now, I was struggling a lot with emotional issues that made me act unreasonably at times, he gave me an ultimatum to get help or it's not going to work. Looking back, I wish I had not jumped into a relationship when I wasn't ready and had got help beforehand and sorted myself out. Nethertheless, I got some counselling for my issues and a year or two later i have a much healthier attitude towards these things and a much better relationship."

unpopularopinion,fgnw1mr,t3_ezak8a,1580954134.0,"Fat shaming has been proven to have negative effects on getting people to lose weight. It. Does.. Not. Work.

People need to start understanding that a large amount of obese individuals suffer from binge eating, a disordered form of eating which comes under the branch of mental health issues. Just as someone who was several stone underweight is treated with extreme concern, people need to realise that the same applies to being obese.

That being said, shaming someone will ultimately just feed the mental health and self esteem issues that underly a lot of individuals issues with food as an emotional crutch and hence just make them gain more weight. Alternatively, it could make them lose weight, but the negative and shameful self image will be there and may potentially manifest into another ED format on the reverse end and an even worse relationship with food.

People need to be educated that first of all, food is not all about the pleasure, food is FUEL first and foremost. Secondly, self love is not fat acceptance. You wouldn't describe any other self harmful behaviour as being self love would you?

The meaning of self love has been distorted. Self love should be striving to be the best version of you that you can be (with healthy boundaries) because you love and respect yourself as a person and that includes eating well and exercising as basic forms of self care. Shaming someone isn't going to fix this, just fuel the movement of people accepting morbidly obese as the norm."

mentalhealth,fgnto0j,t3_ezd6ha,1580952665.0,"One thing I've learnt not to do is compare myself with how I used to be. Working nights is hard on the body and mind, it probably needs to rest. Along with if you have pre-existing mental health issues this makes it harder. A healthy sleep pattern is so important for good mental health but establish with irregular work patterns. 

Have you thought about melatonin or sleep meds to help sleep better when you do, or getting a light therapy lamp for the daytime maybe or if you dont see much sun as that might help regulate your cycle more and alertness in the morning.

You are doing just fine, listen to your body, allow yourself to relax, they are your days off so take it easy and be kind to yourself. You don't always have to be rushing around working. However, if it is related to your mental health and not just your sleep pattern maybe consider seeking some professional help if you haven't already or seek a doctors advice on what the possible options are.

I have always been one to stick up for people and support them if they don't drink if that is their choice, I respect that.

I have a friendship group I see every few months and when we meet up and there is one particular friend in there that I click with the most, and we are both not big drinkers at all. Everyone else seems to think we are mad. They judge me for doing things like play dnd with my friends which is miles cheaper and more fulfilling than going out. 

Every now and then I have a night out if I'm feeling it and drink a bit, but that's like a handful of times a year. Most time I spend with friends and family, going to coffee shops if I'm going to spend money, chatting and forming better connections, playing games with my friends, going out for a nice lunch with my boyfriend, and that I find sooo much more fulfilling than when I was going out all the time and spending so much money on alcohol and going out."

I do try 'hard' to make friends with these people. I go to all the events, I try and chat to them as much as I can. I don't (honestly) feel that I can invite most of them out somewhere especially as they are all tight knit so idk who to invite out and everyone has gone home for the holidays anyways now. I see them already a couple times a week so I see them a fair amount i would say.

Also, I have met so many people I have tried to be friends with and made the effort for who just never return the favour. I don't really understand why it is always me who has to text them, me who has to go out my way to make them care, me to have to invite them out all the time. Why it can never be the opposite like it seems to be for other people.
