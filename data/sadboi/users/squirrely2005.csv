I didn’t correct him.

One plumber I worked with has been here 33 years. 
I’m gonna work on getting my bachelors while I’m there and get into a better paying position then work here until I can retire.

We never got to see the Osborne lights but we vaguely remember that whole backlot early. I wish I had paid more attention to it all. We were even there before they expanded the hub but I don’t remember it. 

Now that I type this out I guess there’s a lot of stuff I wish I had just paid attention to so I could really remember the changes. Now I listen to podcasts or YouTube videos everyday on WDW so it’ll be cool to see all these changes go through."

Since then everywhere I’ve been hasn’t cared about marking neutrals. I takes a second more of your time and it makes it way easier if you have to come back to the panel later or for the service guy years later.

It got real bad on Sunday and I’ve actually felt it before like 6 years ago when my anxiety got real bad but not since then. I think it got triggered by a trip to the dentist Friday. I read later that Novocain has epinephrine in it. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. It’s reassuring that I’m not alone and it’s not as serious as we think it is. Hopefully it puts you’re mind at ease a little that your not the only one and your doctor isn’t bullshitting you.
electricians,fmw6zql,t1_fmw3ewq,1586440881.0,"Yeah at the company I worked for the longest they had this thing where they’d buy the tool(s) and take ten percent out of your check every week until you paid it back. 
Which was nice but it was such a pain to do sometimes. And I’d get what I asked for but something just slightly different than what I actually needed. 

I started doing service at the company before I came to the university and so I bought the veto pro pac backpack. Now it sits in my garage because I asked if I could bring it here and they said they’d just order me a bag. I’ve sold a few tools and there’s a few more I need to sell including that backpack."
electricians,fmw1t1z,t1_fmw0cmg,1586437516.0,"Yes. Some people enjoy buying their own stuff. I did. I never had to buy benders or a huge sds or hole saws or KO set and stuff like that but I had my power tools and basic hand tools. 
I personally liked having MY tools. 
But I just started at a state university and it’s so nice being able to come to work and not lug my heavy ass bags into work everyday. 
I personally never minded buying my own tools. The tools I’ve bought have more than paid for themself at work or on side jobs. And now I can use them for stuff around the house. 

Anyway yes it’s crazy that companies don’t provide every single tool but that’s how open shops are. I never had an issue with it myself and  there’s pros and cons to it."

It really helped pull me out of my funk and helps me now. I believe it but it’s still hard to control sometimes when I physically feel these symptoms. I know it’s just anxiety but it’s still uncomfortable and makes life a little hard sometimes."

electricians,fkhlk1z,t1_fkhi73g,1584201388.0,"When I first started I was on a pretty big job and towards the end when changes started coming our general foreman would have us rush to finish something know the next day we were going to taking it all apart to redo it because of a change order. 

Not saying OP is wrong or doing this but I know some guys that take advantage of stuff like that and say “well we can’t use this wire now. Guess I’ll add it to my scrap pile at home”"
Anxiety,fkg67f9,t1_fkft0j1,1584150943.0,"Literally my thought process. I’ve kind of made myself stop thinking like that but it’s still just really uncomfortable. 
It’ll happen during the day and my legs are straining so bad to keep me still. It’s like clenching my fist almost but it’s my legs. It gets tiring."
Anxiety,fkfqk52,t1_fkfg4g9,1584140250.0,Same here. Have you ever been standing in a parking garage and a car drives by and the floor under you shakes? I’ll get a feeling like that and it sucks.
personalfinance,fkbbu70,t1_fkb8ygk,1584030077.0,"I know when I spoke with the lady at payroll said I did check whatever box indicating my wife works. 
She makes 18.24/ hr right now but hasn’t really been working 40 since our son so total I’m guessing she’ll make 28k. With my 42 that’s about 60k total. Damn. We made 85k two years ago."
personalfinance,fkb8lwa,t1_fkasu9z,1584028286.0,"It wasn’t a full check. I started 2/10 so I missed the whole first week of February. And yes she does work. 
She showed me the 24k or so deduction and then the 2000 for my son. So she showed me what my taxable wages would be which wasn’t much after that and after all my other pretax deductions. 

75/ a month just seems so low."

technology,fjn7xvu,t1_fjmiv3r,1583500686.0,"That’s good. It’s never a bad thing learn more. And even though I’m a terrible student I really enjoy learning so that’s does make it easier. 
 I was told it was between me and another guy when I got hired here and part of the reason they picked me is I went to a trade school and I have my associates."
technology,fjn79wf,t1_fjmjmae,1583500128.0,"I’ve heard the same about another college here but it’s private. Im working for a state university so I think only I would get my tuition paid for. But I could be wrong. Either way I still get decent benefits working for the state. 
Like I’ll be off two weeks for Christmas and New Years. And I’ll be getting paid."
technology,fjmc14e,t1_fjmbq5i,1583466581.0,"Thanks. I’ve been there a month. Just got home from a basketball game. I got paid overtime just in case a breaker trips. Haha 

Anyway yeah I’m just trying to learn all I can. The funny thing is I want to stay at the university but move into a position that I can make more money. It’s just a really laid back environment and it’s perfect for my mental health."
technology,fjmbnjg,t1_fjmba60,1583466311.0,I’m an electrician. I just started at a university. I’m taking advantage of every penny they’ll give me to get my bachelors. I’m halfway there with my associates but I need to learn some more skills that that puts me ahead just a little bit.
nba,fjl7jy9,t1_fjl53qr,1583441446.0,The spurs basically invented load management. Why would they not believe him and not try to force him to play. The spurs probably fucked up something at some point but I don’t they didn’t take an injury seriously.
electricians,fj8rpto,t1_fj8phu5,1583120496.0,"Yeah. I feel like it’ll be interesting being in these classes with these kids with no real world experience. I worked with an inspector for the corps of engineers who was an EE and she said she retired from that because she got tired of how many RFIs she got. I’m sure there was more to it but she specifically mentioned that. 

And yeah my anthropology definitely helped me in a lot of areas and definitely in construction when I first started. It was so weird when I realized how much I could apply what I learned when I first started in the trade. 

And yeah originally I wanted to get a bachelors then try to teach at the high school I went to in their new construction career program. It’s walking distance from the house I just bought but I enjoy working at the university so far so hopefully I can find a better paying position within the university after I get my degree."
electricians,fj8mu84,t1_fj8kjqz,1583117084.0,"That’s pretty cool man. I have an associates in anthropology and have been telling myself for 5 years to go back. I’ve had my journeyman license for 2 years. Oh shit. I have to renew it. Haha I’ll take of it tomorrow I guess. 
Anyway I just started at UT San Antonio and Im very set on starting classes this fall or next spring. They’ll pay for 12 hours a year. thinking of EE but I’m not sure. I like working with my hands but wouldn’t mind finding something a little less hands on. I don’t know how much a bachelors in EE will really help."
electricians,fj8m36x,t1_fj8hudf,1583116583.0,"Definitely. My uncle isn’t dumb at all. Hes a system admin I think. Retired marine after 20 years, retired from school district, now working on base for the government, owns 4 houses, and has his masters. Oh and he’s a Mexican who was literally an anchor baby. Not totally important but he is still somehow a trump supporter. I don’t get it."
Anxiety,fj5scsr,t1_fj5el9o,1583041471.0,"I had this happen to me the other day. I worked 7am to 11:30pm. It was incredibly easy and I was basically just hanging out at this event to make sure nothing lost power. 
Anyway I felt kind of out of it but mostly okay. I laid down and my heart was pounding. I’d sit up and felt okay but as soon as I laid down I felt my heart through my whole body. I eventually fell asleep luckily. 

It happened a couple days before that but I’m just getting used to my work schedule again. It’s generally on 40 hours but I start at 7am and my body needs to get comfortable with that. 

So I’m glad I’m not alone and someone else is experiencing the same. I wish we didn’t have to at all but I won’t stress about it."
todayilearned,fj582hn,t1_fj52c5t,1583026433.0,Yeah I’m a spurs fan and this season sucked. I like the guy and hope we can do something for next year to help him out. He’s been amazing this year but overall the team isn’t making it happen

gifs,fix35ba,t1_fiw847m,1582811459.0,That makes sense because I’m 100% a night owl. And I noticed every time I’d spend the night somewhere I’d wake up before everyone else. I never do that. I sleep in until 10 on weekends and I always wondered if there was a reason I’d wake up so early at friends houses.
Anxiety,fiwb9bf,t3_f9x6by,1582780098.0,"That guy saying that and acting that way was probably a blessing in disguise. Imagine how he’d be to work with. 

I just started at a university 3 weeks ago. I interviewed in December and it was the first time I had a “legit” interview. There were three people interviewing me. I’m an electrician and my last few interviews were basically “what’s your name and can you start tomorrow?” 

Anyway I was pretty intimidated by this interview but just let myself relax and feel confident. And I was honest. I’m a terrible liar so I have to be honest but I flat out told them things I didn’t know when they asked. 
I don’t know anything about VFDs and I don’t have experience with MCCs. I learned about them in school but don’t have hands on experience. 

Just remind yourself that it’s not the end of the world if it doesn’t go well. And nobody knows everything. If you don’t know an answer just tell them. It sounds way better than bullshitting through something. Have you seen the NEC(I know you probably don’t use it but I hope you get my point) It’s huge. 
If you don’t know the answer show them you know how to find it. 

I Deal with anxiety all day everyday so I completely understand how easy it is to overthink these things. 

Good luck. I’m hoping to get my bachelors in EE now that I work here. I already have an associates so I’m halfway there."
