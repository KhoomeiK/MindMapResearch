 **The 1990 Bisexual Manifesto** 

>We are tired of being analyzed, defined and represented by people  other than ourselves, or worse yet, not considered at all. We are  frustrated by the imposed isolation and invisibility that comes from  being told or expected to choose either a homosexual or heterosexual  identity.  
   
 Monosexuality is a heterosexist dictate used to oppress homosexuals and to negate the validity of bisexuality.  
   
 Bisexuality is a whole, fluid identity. Do not assume that bisexuality is binary or duogamous in nature: that we have *""two""*  sides or that we must be involved simultaneously with both genders to  be fulfilled human beings. In fact, don’t assume that there are only two  genders. Do not mistake our fluidity for confusion, irresponsibility,  or an inability to commit. Do not equate promiscuity, infidelity, or  unsafe sexual behavior with bisexuality. Those are human traits that  cross all sexual orientations. Nothing should be assumed about anyone’s  sexuality, including your own.   
>  
>We are angered by those who refuse to accept our existence; our  issues; our contributions; our alliances; our voice. It is time for the  bisexual voice to be heard.  


I think that sub contradicts what it stands for in it's ideas and it's tone of conversation. Saying ""\[...\] anything other than what we read in the Bisexual Manifesto will be resulting in some form of punishment"" is just ridiculous to me as the Bisexual Manifesto teaches acceptance and compassion and fluidity."

For me my home is the place where I can feel safe and recover from pushing my boundaries.  When I was still living at the dorm there were always people around and that completely depleted me of my resources to go out and leave my comfort zone. 

If you want advice I would say if you have a fight, don't try and figure out who is to blame but rather focus on understanding what the underlying issue is and how to go about it.

Looks like all the skates except for the FR FRX 80 are fitness skates. If you want to get into freeride skating including jumps you will need the hard shell boot to protect your ankle from the impact. But if that's not what you are after anytime soon, a fitness skate should work for you.

From my experience the K2 soft boot fitness skates are pretty comfy and they will serve you to learn the basics like going forward and backwards, stopping and all that.
As to three vs four wheels both have their advantages and disadvantages. I only recently got my first pair of three wheel skates and I definitely needed an adjustment period. Three bigger wheels give you an advantage on bumpy roads and you can go a lot faster. But while getting used to them form me they felt a lot less stable in comparison to 4x80. I had to pay really close attention to my posture. Also the first times going downhill were scary as hell because they got fast. And I am pretty afraid of going downhill. 

I would not recommend the powerslide swell however. 110 mm wheels is a lot for a beginner. But I might be biased because I tried them on and absolutely hated the overall feel.

The FR FRX would probably be an investment in a really good pair of skates that could last you a long time while your skill level increases. But I don't think you would go wrong with a comfy pair of K2 skates to try out and learn the basics.

I am not completely sure about that nonbinary thing though.

If you experience attraction to people of multiple genders you can consider yourself bi. But there is no need to put any lable onto yourself. I myself always knew I was bi but only realised how much more I had been in love with the girls I thought I just had crushes on years later.

Mist of the time this is not the case at all. But reading how BPD is missunderstood and stigmatized can really hurt us and throw us back.

My therapist once told me 'our fears often create what we are afraid of' meaning for example if you were afraid of losing someone you might behave in a way that would drive them away from you. So try to relax. Don't let your fears control your thoughts about your friend or the way how you are behaving towards them.
People with BPD are first of all people. Many of us can be kind, loving, understanding but at times intese. But in my experience those who are working on managing their symptoms can be some of the most open, honest and authentic people."
BPD,fm4xpiu,t3_ft32p0,1585762673.0,"This has happened to me in almost every serious relationship I have been in. I shut down during periods of low selfesteem and just don't experience sexual desire at all, although normally I am super sexually active.
But I found out those issues are related to something else as well. During a new relationship there is the thrill of everything being insecure and unstable. If I fullfill my partners desires they will stay. But when the relationship gets more stable, the love increases but the thrill decreases. This has meant the end for many of my relationships but with my current boyfriend we managed to get through it.
We discovered that I like to get into sex a lot more if two conditions are true
1. I don't feel pressured at all. For a while he emotionally punished me when I declined sex and that resulted in me always feeling pressured and never comfortable. 
2. I want to be in control. When I have then chance too initiate contact and he shows ne how much he enjoys being kissed or touched that really helps me to get aroused as well. But I need to now that at any moment I have the option to say 'I don't want to go further than this and that is completely OK.'

I'm really exhausted right now so I'm not sure if I covered everything I should have and if this makes sense at all. Feel free to ask more questions !"

BPD,fm02e8e,t3_fs8van,1585642020.0,A while ago I read the quote 'I shouldn't have to reach crisis for you to believe my suffering'. It really resonated with me at the time and your words made me think of it again.
BPD,flzvagg,t3_fs36s5,1585634688.0,I experience this a lot more than splitting on others. I've always suspected it's a quiet BPD thing.

BPD,flulwjx,t3_fra0kv,1585505246.0,I'm sending you lots of strength to get through.  I believe in you!
BPD,fluhyhv,t1_flugptn,1585502965.0,"Sadly I'm not in the UK so I can't really help you with the system there. Im in Germany and the mental health system here differentiates between psychological psychotherapists which do counseling, therapy and give you some general diagnoses (like depression or anxiety) and psychiatrist which are specialized doctors that can fully diagnose you and prescribe medication. Usually you have to be referred to a psychiatrist by a therapist or a general practitioner but if your symptoms are bad enough they may decide to see you without a referral. 
I was referred to a psychiatric hospital for an ambulant diagnosis by a therapist. I then had to wait a couple month for my first appointment. After that they did some testing and I finally got the diagnosis. Between every appointment waiting time was about a month. If I wanted to get into a program at that clinic the waiting list would be at least six months but they couldn't exactly tell me.
So just getting the diagnosis has definitely been a months long process and I feel like I'm still on the luckier side..."
BPD,fluf3oh,t3_fr8vcc,1585501341.0,"Hey there. I have a very similar story to yours. First I was diagnosed with bipolar and then with generalized anxiety and depression by a different therapist. Getting those diagnoses helped me a lot at first because it made more specialized therapy available. But after some time in CBT I felt like we had hit a point where I wasn't making progress anymore because my therapist didn't understand how I just couldn't grasp some fundamental concepts. Especially regarding identity and selfworth. He was still a damn good therapist who taught me many skills and brought me to a point where I understood myself enough and go out and get a more accurate diagnosis. But eventually I outgrew him and had to find someone more specialized. 
So I think if you want to make the best progress you can and find a therapist who is experienced with your disorder, the more accurate your diagnosis the better.

I still don't tell most people about my BPD. My boyfriend, few of my best friends, my mum and strangers on the internet know. But for the most part if I have to talk about my mental health I still use 'depression and generalized anxiety ' because those are the symptoms most people will get to see and can relate to or at least understand. 

I'm not saying you have to get a diagnosis but it can be really helpful to understand yourself and find the right support. But even if you get a diagnosis you are not obliged to tell anyone if you don't feel comfortable or safe sharing."
