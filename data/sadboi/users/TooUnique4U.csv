Unfortunately the large majority of vocal gun owners are racist or have otherwise equally objectionable viewpoints. I have ran into very few rational, well informed, and mentally balanced people in the gun community."

PublicFreakout,fpjb8gg,t3_gdnvy0,1588662345.0,The back story on this is that the woman was browsing porn on her new phone and basically bricked it in the process. She wanted a new phone and the owner wouldnt provide it because it was user error. In addition to that this whole backstory is made up and now im just rambling.
SocialistRA,fpi4z2o,t3_gdcukw,1588633761.0,Very nice!
