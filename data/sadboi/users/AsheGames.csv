Arkansas,fb5de6l,t3_eb6qad,1576525562.0,I do t give a shit honestly. Live your best life. The only downside is the smell so it’s whatever.
ipod,f7b0q4p,t1_f7aw8wc,1573549278.0,Negative
offmychest,f5zwi97,t1_f5urec3,1572591787.0,I think the thing that hurts the most is when he compared me to my 11 year old niece and said she was the adult and I was the child. That was so fucking painful. He never said sorry. I was told that it was a joke. It’s to late anyway. The damage is done. My mom also says that it has to do with my attitude towards him but I’m like how am I suppose to act yknow? Idk I’m just in a slump lately.
depression,f5xwukz,t1_f5vwie8,1572547437.0,That’s awesome!! And you keep at it too! It will be a hobby of mine. I was thinking about making a YouTube channel for doing skits and such to give myself a creative outlet yknow? A place to vent by doing comedy. I hope your dreams come true for you!
depression,f5vvthy,t1_f5vvh7z,1572502488.0,"Thanks for your advice. I'm going for a degree in business right now so I should be good in having something to fall back on. I was looking into acting classes and thought to myself, is it worth it? I didn't even think about the memories and friendships I could make along the way honestly. Thanks for your advice."
aspergers,f5rb5w8,t3_dowiwt,1572391335.0,Yes. Especially when trying to achieve my dreams. I'm like am I good or are people lying to me?
offmychest,f5mmmtm,t3_do9nn6,1572291516.0,This is exactly what I fear happening after college. It's bad enough at Walmart as a young adult feeling unfulfilled but this happening afterward scares me.
aspergers,f4t0rzg,t3_dlmyb9,1571782811.0,"Honestly ya because when I am learning about or doing something I love, the time flies like no tomorrow"
aspergers,f4cib9k,t1_f4bzg58,1571529504.0,Marylin Monroe?! I can’t believe I didn’t know that! I’m told that with hard work my dreams with come true and I hope I can make it happen. On a. Random note. I have always wondered though if the mimicking accent thing could follow into language learning. Like to eventually be able to sound like a native speaker? Random I know but the thought popped in my head. But ya I’m totally gonna look up more about Marylin Monroe now for inspiration. Thanks~
offmychest,f4bai2o,t3_dk3ej3,1571509393.0,I know I don't know you but damn I am so proud of you! Live your best life! Don't let anybody tell you different!!
aspergers,f4b5xsx,t1_f49hqjr,1571507316.0,Thanks for the advice! Happy cake day
aspergers,f4b5a0i,t1_f49ngdm,1571507013.0,Thank you so much for the info! I have thought about getting an acting voice for a long time now. I'll definitely be looking more into it.
aspergers,f4b51m1,t1_f49od9s,1571506911.0,That's really cool to think about. It gives me hope as an actor. Also I'm glad I got you interested!
aspergers,f4b4ccx,t1_f4alv0p,1571506580.0,I mean I love backstage stuff to. I love acting and producing.
offmychest,f47muvh,t3_dji1i7,1571424764.0,Congrats!!! But remember that your job isn't what makes you you!
depression,eznczbo,t3_d1fhkj,1568004135.0,I relate to this so much. I relate to the point that when someone makes a comment or makes fun of me and it’s something I hate about myself I think about hurting myself. I can even be in a good mood. I can be fine because I am on 2 different medications for that but the moment a comment or joke comes in about something I hate about myself I think about making myself vomit or bleed.
OpenChristian,ey1f7nu,t1_ey0cxyt,1566698042.0,Yogananda? Like the Indian monk?
depression,ey1e3tf,t3_cml6ni,1566697198.0,I’m frustrated right now that I am on 2 different medications and still can’t handle things piling up. A fews months ago my dog died and then this month one of my friends died and I have been fine but then something happened at work and it has all come flooding back. I miss my friend. I miss my dog. I am on two meds. Wellbutrin and lexapro. I’m still suicidal when I get bad news and sometimes just have a bad day. I still feel like cutting. I feel so alone right now because nobody understands what I’m going through and I don’t wanna tell anyone at work because I’m scared of being locked up or something and then just getting hate from my family when I get home.
mentalillness,ex17lmm,t1_ewqpjjr,1565933559.0,Thank you so much! Its good to read i kind messege like this even if its from a stranger. I love Jesus and believe he is my lord and savior and just want to do what his mission is for me.
NintendoSwitch,ewqkyt8,t1_ewqkpgo,1565669114.0,Holy shit that is really good! Damn now I want one.
mentalillness,ewqkml0,t3_cpfjt3,1565668800.0,"I have issues with this because I also have had problems with being bisexual. I am attracted to both men and women(I’m a girl)and I don’t know why. I don’t date really because I don’t trust people. Please don’t tell me it’s a sin. I already feel like it hurts my journey getting close to God. I tell all my lgbt friends that God loves them, but I myself always doubt his love for me. I believe that Jesus is my lord and savory and that through him I have eternal life but it is a fear I have in the back of my mind. I know we sin everyday and that he is forgiving but i still worry. I don’t understand why he would want to send people to hell for being attracted somebody or loving somebody. I feel like the real sin is lust and fornication in that situation. The only people I have come out to is my youth pastor and a close friend. He believes it’s a sin, but he doesn’t hate me for it. I can’t tell my family because she says it’s wrong and lgbt people deserve to commit suicide or die. Does God still love me even though I feel this way?
I have always been so scared because I started having these feelings in the 8th grade. Tried to deny it all this time but idk what to do anymore."
mentalillness,ewqk795,t1_ewpgnvt,1565668408.0,What is IMO?
mentalillness,ewqjoer,t3_cpjjkv,1565667948.0,Tbh me too
NintendoSwitch,ewqjm16,t3_cpi4ha,1565667892.0,What all is different with the new model? I have the splatoon model and haven’t had that issues like joycon drift or anything of that nature. How much of a battery life improvement is it? Ps vita slim said that too back in the day and it was only like an hour more of life.
VicMignogna,ewqjhpe,t1_ewpk0r5,1565667786.0,Exactly
eatingdisorderstories,ewqjgxt,t1_ewn0dd7,1565667767.0,Binge eating disorder? Does that involve sometimes making yourself vomit? Or going through a cycle of overeating and then not really eating anything for a few days too? If so then your probs right. Either way I’ll take your advice and try to look into a therapist. I want to beat this and become a healthy weight and love myself.
bangtan,ewnek0n,t3_coxej9,1565576040.0,My first thought was good they need a vacation.
Deppression,ewhecca,t1_ewhcfc2,1565405500.0,What would you consider proper help? I have been talking with my friend off and on about it but not my family. I told my mom and she wasn’t very sympathetic and I just left it alone. I’m afraid if I tell my friends to much they will report me or something. I am mainly talking to friends at work because that is where I am most of the time. I work at Walmart and honestly it was really hard today. I would be distracted but then I would randomly start thinking about her death and want to hide. I know it will get better eventually but it’s so damn annoying that this is the way I am reacting again.
Showerthoughts,et8s40a,t3_cae56j,1562567645.0,Accurate
Dance,esjt2cd,t1_es3n1eu,1562041171.0,Oh wow. That’s awesome!!
Dance,esjt1ne,t1_es2j4mx,1562041156.0,I was thinking about doing it as a minor in college in a year or so(transferring schools)as one of my majors is theater and film and I figure it could be a good minor. Should I start out with dance lessons for beginners in my area then look into those classes? Is ballet the best style to learn at first? I have a few styles I wanna learn lol. Also thanks for the advice you have already given me!
AskReddit,erjdclg,t3_c27tbb,1560924421.0,I’ll get up early and get shit done before work.

VicMignogna,eraioty,t1_epsbxsq,1560645146.0,That claim she had about him doing that sounds exactly like the claim against Todd from like a year ago so I instantly didn’t believe her.
casualnintendo,eqh86vu,t1_eqewpta,1560051549.0,Also I was a child.
casualnintendo,eqh84nl,t3_by570r,1560051506.0,Alright I would like to say that some of the ds’s I’m talking about weren’t all broken. 2 were 3ds systems. The original one I bought which I gave to my friend and the new 3ds I currently own. I have had 2 systems break on me but the da came out when I was like 8 and I played them every single day and took them everywhere. Just thought I would put that out there. I was just making a joke and saying I thought the gba line was built better than the ds line. Thanks!
casualnintendo,eqh7ui0,t1_eqe7otf,1560051305.0,I only had like 3. I said 5 on there but ya. My original phat da my brother broke and I had a da light that had a hinge break after several years. Tried to replace the shell ended up getting another one. Then I got a 3ds if we want to count that.
casualnintendo,eqh7noa,t1_eqewpta,1560051168.0,It was a slight exaggeration. Really I only had 3. One was the original da that my older brother broke. The second one was on me though. I played it a lot and dropped it a time or 2 I suppose. I will say the original ds was built better than the lite.
ipod,eqh7fwr,t1_eqgqz2l,1560051018.0,Didn’t even think about it since the cable was new. I’ll buy another one and try that.
weightlosssurgeries,eq5jnh2,t1_eq5jfx9,1559803430.0,Thats a good point. My mom says you dont really miss food because you get full super easy. And your right on not having to tell everybody i suppose. Idk maybe its partly me judging myself.
