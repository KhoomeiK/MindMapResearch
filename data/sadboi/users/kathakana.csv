AltLadyboners,fqx7qvw,t1_fqx79d7,1589727649.0,It's kind of how altladyboners came into being.  I set up gingerladyboners first and found that running a sub wasn't as terrifying as I expected.  A downvoted to 0 post of Dave Navarro on ladyboners gave me the push to set up altladyboners.
AltLadyboners,fqx60or,t1_fqwvdgk,1589726585.0,"I've posted a few of his more vanilla pics on /r/gingerladyboners \- I think I posted one in the last few days (although lockdown brain can't be sure anymore - may have been an hour ago, a week ago or last month!)"

AltLadyboners,fqwpfh0,t1_fqv6byz,1589713034.0,He also has gorgeous flame red hair.
AltLadyboners,fqwpbzb,t1_fqvh3c1,1589712932.0,I think some of his old modelling pics are a bit more vanilla  (although not the catwalk ones) but the ones which he's set up and tie in with his art are definitely not.  He also created a lot of controversy in the 2000s because he was modelling for women's fashion and mens.
LadyBoners,fqtd27w,t1_fqr7q5d,1589636431.0,Ah that's a shame.  I didn't look up who he was as it's tricky to do on my phone while Reddit's open.

wynonnaearp,fq6a62e,t3_gh3yrl,1589127578.0,"It's not in the UK either.  I think Amazon have it but you have to pay for it, it's not part of Amazon Prime videos.  I'm still holding out for Netflix for the time being but may pay if they don't add it soon."
goth,fq67ryy,t3_gh3xpt,1589126213.0,He's a British musician and used to do these videos years ago but during lockdown he's restarted.  He talks a lot about covering beard/stubble and getting a more androgynous look. I'm female and have loved him since he was on the UK Voice.  He's also really approachable so if you comment with questions he'll answer.
Gingerladyboners,fq55ew2,t1_fq49jpg,1589093087.0,He created quite a bit of controversy in the 2000s because he modeled both men and women's clothes on  the catwalk.

AltLadyboners,fq14xy4,t1_fpy2wmf,1589041802.0,He'd probably be incredibly chuffed with that.  He was 59 the other day and still looking really fucking good.

AltLadyboners,fp9pdsn,t1_fp9p2qg,1588431712.0,No worries - I think your posts will get a bit more love if it's clear it's you in the pic.
AltLadyboners,fp9p5yo,t3_gbcuue,1588431576.0,He looks a bit like Jake Hold (British model and part of the red hot modelling group).

AltLadyboners,fp9oxg2,t3_gbwop4,1588431424.0,Don't forget to add a self post flair if these pics are of you. I've done it to this one and your last pic.

Gingerladyboners,foznnwx,t1_foz45h9,1588193696.0,Yes.  I just play it safe and follow both accounts.  I wouldn't want to miss anything.
Gingerladyboners,foz3azx,t1_foxk433,1588183967.0,He's on Instagram as @tiborpusch.official and @tiborpusch2.0 - I think he originally intended his pottery to go in one account and his modelling pics to go in the other but it's all a mixed.
Gingerladyboners,fow1jux,t1_fow16dl,1588111312.0,"He's a potter too so if you thought he was hot, watch him work with some clay for a bit."
AltLadyboners,fovxjhz,t1_fouycf2,1588109272.0,No worries.  Its only so that we're being respectful of peoples wishes around where their pics get shared.
AltLadyboners,fou4btq,t3_g9kc4l,1588075827.0,Totally.  He also looks like he'd be great at hugs.

AltLadyboners,foqhvv0,t3_g83j6e,1587993936.0,If you have multiple hot pics of the same artist it works well to post them in one post  either as an album (via imgur) or creating a thread for other to share their pics.  That way the sub won't get flooded with pics of the same few men.
AltLadyboners,foqhop4,t1_foqfh4u,1587993805.0,I think a few may need to be reminded to share albums or several pics on one post rather than lots of pics of the same artist but we can try.
Gingerladyboners,foq34wf,t1_fooncvi,1587981274.0,Can't disagree with that.
AltLadyboners,fojlkyy,t3_g6cucv,1587824027.0,Also if this person isn't in the public eye he needs to post the pics himself.  It looks like he has been since so this can stay but in future please remember this.

My partner thinks we live with Zoltan Kaszas and Christoph Schneider at the moment as he can hear their voices in our flats most days.  To be fair, Zoltan puts out pretty much daily content - he's well worth following on Instagram of Facebook - his comedy is hilarious."
AltLadyboners,fnwliqe,t1_fnwdymg,1587320684.0,I love that he was a goth in his younger days and it sounds like he still is at heart.  He knows his music.

celebritybulge,fnw68tk,t1_fntx2lp,1587312265.0,That was a good read.  I  laughed so  hard when I saw that Chip Z'nuff has a voice like Krusty the Clown.

AltLadyboners,fntiqzb,t3_g3qm5w,1587242477.0,I have created a Patton thread so feel free to add future Pattons to that thread.  I can sticky it at the top if people would like but I shall leave him be for now unless there's any requests from others.
AltLadyboners,fntig7o,t3_g3ujir,1587242305.0,Mr Patton is my personal number one ladyboner ever but as a mod I can see others tiring of his hot little face and bod on in their feed so thought I'd just create a master thread for them all. I know we've all be self isolating and quarentining ourselves like responsible folks and are now growing thirsty for some hot alternative man candy but we don't want to drive others away by flooding the sub with just one flavour of man candy. Please just stick to the one thread for your now.   Thank you.

He's either singing and pulling some strange face or this pic is really pixelly or have someones watermark all over his face.  He does sing for a goth band and he has the look but it's not especially obvious in the pic. He's got kind of a much better looking Ian Curtis - similar style.
