deadbydaylight,exbi9iz,t3_cs0mhd,1566131801.0,"I’m a solo player and how I got better honestly was watching how other top dbd players play (on both survivors and killer) this helped me so I recommend if u have some time watch some gameplay from either Monto or Tru3tallent (who I watch)  so you can see what u need to do to be better. Also as for the maps you’ll get used to them overtime as I did

Edit: I don’t always do good lol but at least I know what I have to do to win essentially or at least rank up :p"
