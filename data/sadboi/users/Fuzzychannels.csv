BDSMcommunity,flkw4qu,t1_flkqyxo,1585248795.0,Sometimes it's hard for me to communicate online. Doms are just so intimidating sometimes and I worry that being open about my issues will scare them off. It's not a well founded fear but I feel it anyway.
ADHD,fhvz4kh,t1_fhvw47d,1581903583.0,Well the side effects started before I started the Strattera and I didnt feel this bad before I started treating my adhd. It sucks bc the adderall was actually working. Will probably call doctor tomorrow either way lol
BPD,fffhuus,t3_ernn21,1579884296.0,DAE feel real isolated when they have nothing social to do outside of work? I dont have much of a friend group and tend to spend a lot of time on my own. I've been trying to meet new people through various groups but making friends that want to hang out is hard. Like I'm in my 20s and I see other people my age constantly going to parties and other functions as little groups and I feel so out of the loop.
BPD,fffh6y9,t1_ffafw49,1579883881.0,Yes! For as long as I can remember actually. Its usually when I'm doing something active/ moving around a bunch that it happens.
BPD,fb348h1,t1_fb33sdo,1576463882.0,I should probably look for different work somewhere. I'm a temp where Im at now and dont know if they'll test me again to get on full time bc I really dont hate my job rn. But you're right about a lot of that.
BPD,fb3395e,t3_eb5x5a,1576463251.0,I feel this way often. I'm trying to move away from it and have a healthier view of myself but it's super hard to get out of a lot of the time.
BPD,fb30u8u,t3_eb6mot,1576461616.0,You're doing great!
BPD,f8qur1d,t3_e1iwei,1574724715.0,Yeah :/ I'm at a place with a tiny staff and I'm the youngest so it's not possible for me to make friends there
BPD4BPD,f8qm9us,t1_f8qktwf,1574719977.0,I appreciate it! Trying to stay positive in spite of it all.
BPD4BPD,f8qjz90,t1_f8qigu8,1574718980.0,"Well the actual reason was that I was perpetually unsure about my attraction to her. I loved talking to her and snuggling but I couldn't engage with her sexually at all hardly. I found myself thinking about breaking up a lot and I decided that it was for the best. I just feel so bad because it's the holidays and I worry about her not having anyone to talk to since everyone she knows is out of town. My timing was just horseshit and I'll probably regret it forever. I should have done it sooner. She's very emotional since she's started hormone treatment (she's trans), so it's hitting her pretty hard too. But she has no diagnosed emotional problems. She was in love with me but I could never say it back. I've never made someone cry like that before and it kills me. I'm going to try to give her a lot of space and if she wants to be friends, then it'll happen someday. Or not. Either way I have to keep moving."
BPD4BPD,f8q78vu,t1_f8q4rq6,1574713211.0,Thank you for the kind words. One of my best friends is an ex so I'm used to being friends with my exes. I know that's not always how it goes though. I dont know how I'd cope with never seeing her again. I'd feel better just to know that she'll be okay. She'd be the first ex that I couldn't be friends with and I'm trying to understand that might just be the case. I guess the thing I want most is closure.
BPD,f8lnap7,t3_e0yt62,1574623713.0,Brains will tell you all sorts of bad stuff. Sometimes it's hard to realize that people do care about you. You're never alone
BPD,f8l4g1p,t1_f8l3hse,1574618265.0,I know this must be harder for her. It's why I feel bad even asking for support. But I do hope I can see her again soon.
BPD,f8ky3cw,t1_f8ktuzo,1574616501.0,I think it's the bad timing that's bothering me the most. I just thought that I wouldn't want somebody to feel the way that I felt about her and decided that it was for the best. So I should be more confident in my decision
BPD,f8kxddc,t1_f8ksqav,1574616295.0,I did say that I still wanted to be friends. She said it would be too painful for her right now but offered to let me take her somewhere Monday or Tuesday. Maybe we could talk about it again then if that time comes.
BPD,ex0r3je,t3_cqvg43,1565920161.0,"I can relate to this. I recently had a shattering experience finding out that my (ex) crush and fp didn't really consider me a friend and was basically just using me for rides. Even so, I still want to say yes when she asks if I want to go somewhere. It's real lame lol"
BPD,ex0qjob,t3_cqxjvx,1565919751.0,I can relate! I try to practice mindfulness when this happens but it's hard sometimes...
BPD,epu3vq2,t3_bvyf31,1559503196.0,"I have a few friends that are all spread out so I don't have the definitive ""friend group"" that folks seem to have lol. I'm a big clingy dork and that makes it hard for me to develop adult friendships sometimes. My way of dealing with it is by learning to make friends with myself more (way easier said than done, obviously). I'll take myself to shows and events and even try new food on my own sometimes. It's honestly kind of fun"
BPD,epsi7h9,t1_epray02,1559449889.0,I actually just got out of a codependent relationship lmao. It's different because I'm not relying on my current crush to nurture or indulge in feelings pertaining to my illness. My situation is more like limerance since we aren't super close.
BPD,epshy39,t1_epr99hg,1559449614.0,"I've invited her to a couple of things that she had to cancel on before and I was super bummed for the rest of the night every time lol. I just tried to be understanding in my own head, but it still felt like pure rejection. I'm beginning to understand this feeling as being purely limerance, which isn't great for me but I'm also kind of enjoying it since I just got out of a 3 year relationship and my brain likes the dopamine. I should really find a balance though."
BPD,epshmlo,t1_epra4x3,1559449274.0,"This is mildly inspirational lol. She knows about my illness and when we lived together she saw me be messy a lot, but it doesn't seem like it outwardly bothers her at all. I may be able to work up the courage to ask her out forreal sooner or later."
