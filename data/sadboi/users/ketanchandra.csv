medicalschoolEU,fp202zo,t3_gav2eh,1588252230.0,"Indian here too. I believe you have finished your HS this year only. So did I. I had Biology though. If you want to ever come back to India, make sure the university you're choosing is MCI recognised. Also, why are you trying to get into a medical school? Without biology it will be extremely difficult for you. From what I've heard you would have to have decent knowledge in biology to do well in initial 2 years, which are the foundation years for your entire course. I'd recommend to take a drop and study biology of class 11 and 12. Maybe give NIOS exam. If I'm not mistaken someone had asked a similar question here before. He was not from biology background and wanted to get into medical school. What most people told him was that if a medical school accepts you even if you didn't have biology, imagine the quality of education there. Some schools are easy to get into but they can fail and deport you if you don't maintain high grades. If I were you I wouldn't get into the field of medicine without having a background in biology."
