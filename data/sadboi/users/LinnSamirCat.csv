I'm not gonna ask you private things on here, but if you in a medical transition I hope you can ask your doctor for someone to talk to, like a therapist or so, to help you through this process and find your new identity? I don't know how things work in your country but you should be able to get talk support in this process, at least I wish everyone would be offered that! (Healthcare in my country is SHIT!) And even if you're not in transition I can really recommend talking to someone to help find identity and your own path in life. I have many psychiatric problems, but for a few years I went to a special therapist and we didn't talk so much about problems but more identity, and I realised what I wanted to do in my life, what was important, what I did not want to do and I really found a sense of who I was. Now over 30 I feel very secure about that part, my identity and what I want in my life, but other illnesses are still plaguing me and making my life shit, but that's different. At least I have a core now. A core I didn't have before.

bipolar2,f4at4co,t3_djz0i4,1571500961.0,"I've aways heard that you treat your bipolar disorder FIRST, and if there is still ADHD problems you can medicate for that AFTER. Reason is many bipolar people go manic on ADHD medication, so it's not good to risk it. And frankly speaking, ADHD (as painful as it can be) can wait another year or so unmedicated, whereas bipolarity can literally kill you if you wait. So if they suspect bipolar disorder, try treating that first.

Also, bipolar disorder always have a first episode, usually in the teens/early twenties. Before this you did not have any symptoms. ADHD on the other hand has followed you throughout your entire life, present before 6 years of age. Very few people have regular hypomania from 6 yo. 

Example: I had my first depression at 9 (which is ridiculously early) and was then depressed on and off, but my first mixed episode with any hypomanic symptoms was at 16 yo. Right now I top all tests of having ADD and I suffer from the exact same concentration diffuclutes. Do I have ADD? No, because all this started about 3 years ago when we decided to change in my medications and from trying new medications and many depressions and mixes that I've had these 3 years my brain is a bit tired. I might add I have Lamotrigine that is famous for cognitive side effects. I doubt I got ADD at 29 years of age, and am firmly conviced it's meds and too many episodes in a big confusing mix. However, the symptoms are exactly the same. 

So you need to look into the bigger picture, not just follow a symptom test. Right after having seen a horror movie I bet everyone is scoring top on paranoia tests and hearing things that aren't there. They don't have schizophrenia for that. 

All this being said - it's pretty common to have both bipolar disorder and AD/HD. You still treat the moods first and the ADHD second. 

Good luck!!"

I'd say confidence comes with time and a perfect balance of pushing yourself and avoiding. If you're really scared of spiders and ""treat"" it by picking one up and having a panic attack from it, then you've gained nothing (rather more fear!). You need to push yourself just enough but not too much. Cut yourself some slack sometimes, it's okay to be scared, you don't have to be supersocial and go to many parties if you don't want to. Find challenges that you WANT to do, and do them in a scale that FITS you personally. I could never pick up a spider. But I'm learning to take them with the vacuum cleaner and get less shaky and jumpy every time. 

So who says you need to be confident? Is it you? Or is it peer pressure? When you listen to what you want yourself and set your own challenges, that's when you're gonna succeed. And you're gonna smile in the process :-) That's what I asked for, your happiness that was budding to be let out <3

They deal with mental problems all the time and will help you to the right place.

I've also been in your situation a year ago. Mixed and cutting and gone deeper and deeper and everything was just horrible. What happened? I got into a ward (willingly) that was SO GOOD and they helped me SO MUCH!! Yeah,, I was still mixed and at times danced around the ward singing and sometimes sat in a corner crying with my teddy bear, but I felt SAFE because I was in hospital. I wasn't alone with everything anymore. I could come to them when the thoughts were too strong and we had agreed they would take time and talk to me then, just as I had agreed to not cut but ask for help instead. That hospital stay was the most positive in my entire life!! (Others have been more important and life-saving sections.) For the first time I felt it HELPED!

Fun fact: The wounds from one cutting failed t heal correctly. I had expected a few weeks, it took FOUR MONTHS and I was well out of my mix by then and that whole summer was destroyed and I had to go to hospital every week for them to change the dressings and they just wouldn't heal. It wasn't superBAD, just they healed ""wrong"" and wouldn't go away.

bipolar2,f249c4q,t3_dbu8mf,1569947279.0,"Get another doctor. For real. Bipolar disorder type 2 can be very tricky to medicate. Do some simple research yourself on reliable medical websites. 

The most common mood stabilizers for bipolar 2 is either Lithium or Lamotrigine. Lithium protects more from the ups and Lamotrigine almost only from the downs. The antipsychotic Seroquel/Quetiapin is also often used since it's very anti-manic and mildly antidepressive. Quite often these in combination and/or added an antidepressant.

 I can just say that Lithium has a worse reputation that it deserves, nowadays they use much lower doses. No zombies from the 50's any more! I know a woman who's taken it for 30+ years with no weight gain and perfect kidneys. Otherwise Lamotrigine is considered mild, but can cause allergic-like skin rash that can be dangerous, so then you need to stop asap. If you don't develop it, there's generally no weight gain, no tiredness. I got VERY brainfoggy after 5+ years, but that's my brain. I have no idea how yours would respond. So we can not advice you, only give information that you can research about yourself and form a good amature opinion.

I don't understand what kind of ""phrases"" you're referring to, I'm thinking and talking about facts.

It's a lot better if these young people find their identity in sports or gaming or scrap booking or whatever they're interested in. It breaks my heart to see these people have a severe personality crisis (because they usually are the noun ""asexuals"", instead of people who are the verb ""asexual""), just becaues they are what 98% of the population is = allosexual.

Do not force yourself to have sex if you don't want to, no matter how much you love the person. If you decide that you want it, maybe it'd be good for you to think a bit about which kinds of sex you don't like and which you're more indifferent or positive to. And, do include toys in that.

Your brain just can't do it, you just shake your head and say you're too tired, but for me I can't be too tired because it's not an article, it's my mom saying a sentence directly to my face.

I do get better with naps during the day, especially if I fall asleep and not just rest. I get giddy after waking up at 4 pm, sure, but that passes and is a hell of a lot better than what was before.

Slow circular motions, rather low down on your stomach, it HAS to be counter-clockwise, to follow your bowels' natural movements. When actually sitting on the toilet - don't push much! Lean forward and do deep breathing with your lower stomach coming out towards your thighs, then in. I think it massages the bowels somehow, Idk, but it WORKS!

I guess this is the ruminative nature of depression. It's always interesting to see you change so much so quickly, I'm rapid cycling, but that doesn't change the fact I'm depressed now.
