cscareerquestions,fqzuzzc,t3_glrfr8,1589776050.0,"Currently in my second year of college, and I am honestly a bit relieved after looking at these replies. My first year was pretty awful, Professors + TAs constantly talking down to me or ignoring me, classmates either wanting to ""help"" (i.e. sleep with you) and then getting rude/aggressive when rejected, and loads of other BS. But. this may also just be the campus I was at, luckily I'm transferring next year, and I'm hoping it will be different. But its nice to see that in the professional world, hopefully things will be a bit better."

depression_help,fq3a0tg,t3_gghozh,1589064399.0,"I've blocked out a lot from the past few years, but I was lucky enough to have a few good years in high school. I used to be the one that was always busy. Always in meetings for school clubs, eating and talking with my friends, mentors, or teachers. I was the loud one in the group who was confident enough to speak her mind to anyone. 

Sometimes I think back to how I used to be, how much I just loved life and loved being around people. I feel like a shell of my former self now. I'd like to think that every once in a while, on the good days, that person comes back out and I get to feel like me again for a few hours. Unfortunately, most of the time, I'm just doing my best to over-compensate  with energy, so that I still give off the same image of happiness that I used to. 

I miss that energy. I miss living and loving my life rather than just making it through each day. Right now, I'm just holding onto the idea that someday, I will love my life again, or at least enjoy it every once in a while. Maybe someday."

Iâ€™m about to finish my freshman year in CS, and I have met one professor and (maybe) 2 guys that have genuinely been kind and just treated me like a person, not a child, and not an object. Iâ€™m transferring next semester to a new school, hoping that the climate will be different there, but also trying not to get my hopes up."
