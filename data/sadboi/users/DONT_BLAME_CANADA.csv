Tenchi Muyo!   Favorite was Ryoko. Least favorite was Sasami. She was really annoying, and it was kind of awkward some of the adult content that would happen and there’s this young girl chillin.  

Dragonball Z.   Favorite was Vegeta. His name is actually part of my work password. Least favorite was Freeza... not because he wasn’t a good bad guy, but the voicing. I hated his voice.  

Bojack Horseman.  Favorite is hands down Bojack, I relate with a lot of the good and the bad. Least favorite is insanely hard to choose in this show because they all have motives but I’ll say Doctor Champ. He didn’t have to be such a tool.  

Bonus: Mr Robot.  My favorite character was Tyrell, god I loved Tyrell (and Joanna.) Least favorite was Santiago."
