You absolutely have to start telling people. Tell a school counsellor, close friend, relative, psychologist, therapist, or the police.

I‚Äôm a little rusty when it comes to skincare because I haven‚Äôt been on this sub in months, but I‚Äôve got the basics down so I should be able to help a bit! Out of curiosity, do you live in a particularly cold place? Since your skin is very dry I‚Äôd definitely pick up a gentle, but rich hydrating moisturiser. You can use this moisturiser at day or night, doesn‚Äôt matter when. Generally people use moisturiser at both day and night, which I would strongly recommend that you do as well. I‚Äôd also ‚Äòlock‚Äô the moisturiser in at night by using an occlusive, like Vaseline or paw paw balm. I‚Äôd probably recommend trying a different gentle cleanser other than the Cetaphil one, as from experience and according to what I‚Äôve read online that cleanser had a change in the way that it was made and it causes many people to break out and or have adverse reactions. Cerave is a very popular brand of cleanser that would be suited towards your skin, but a regular gentle cleanser would also do a good job. Personally, I use the Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser. You know when a cleanser is gentle by looking at the ingredients - make sure it doesn‚Äôt contain any essential oils, perfume, alcohols, dye and as you get to know your skin better, any other ingredients that may break you out. Most people tend to break out from highly comedogenic ingredients like coconut oil. Looking out for potential irritants and such also applies to other skincare products you may use. 

This is a little all over the place but going back to moisturisers I‚Äôd recommend that you choose moisturisers that have ceramides in them or small amounts of niacinamide and vitamin e because they tend to be very helpful for dry skin. Hopefully this helps a bit x
