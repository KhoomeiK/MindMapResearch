To the judge, things are witnessed (remember the lost civilization that he draws and then erases) not because of their inerent importance but because of their repetition. As if with their repetition, they lost their awful meaning, they just became part of a kind of indifference of everything around them. The war exists to him like a forest whom by fire can grow again, till the next oblivious moment. The idea of cycle: the eternal cycle that nietzsche has shown us. Things exist for him and by him because he is the primordial witness of that cycle, whereas the others are just concerned about the trauma experience and the changing of it all, without realizing that is impossible to change it."
