anyways heres a list of right wing terrorism in the united states https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_terrorism#United_States

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Terrorism_Database

heres a big take away from both of these : According to analysis by the newspaper of data from the Global Terrorism Database, 92 of 263 domestic terrorism events – 35% – that occurred from 2010 to 2017 were right-wing related, while 38 (14%) were Islamist extremist-related, and 34 (13%) were left-wing related. Not only that, but a criminologist from John Jay College stated that right-wing attacks were statistically more likely to result in fatalities
