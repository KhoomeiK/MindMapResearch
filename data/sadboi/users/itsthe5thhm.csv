NEET,fl9r3kz,t3_fney25,1584966826.0,"What I was properly diagnosed with:
Depression
Social anxiety
OCD

What I might have:
Bipolar disorder - was never properly diagnosed with this one but the dr said I might have manic depression which is the old name for it and I can never really hold friendships/relationships very long due to my unstable emotional swing, I ghosted tons of people for simply saying the wrong thing to me, I can hate someone in spite them never done anything wrong and I hit euphoria one second only to turn into a raging bull in the next.

High Functioning Autism? - probably not but I share a lot of its common traits. A lot of my relatives hated me as a kid because they think I'm retarded or something, I can never focus in class and I only learn how to read, write and count properly like when I was close to 10 years old. I failed almost everytime in class and got kicked out of theirs houses a few times thinking that I was a bad influence to their kids, particularly with their studies. I have problem maintaining eye contact since forever, I say lots of random/stupid/wrong/unnecessarily long things even with the simplest of serious question and I get scolded a lot of times for that.

Personally, I don't really care what I might or might not have anymore, I basically cut a lot of ties with people as of now except for my own family and a few relatives and like 1 friend that I still talk to in real life. Honestly, I don't really give that much shit anymore."
