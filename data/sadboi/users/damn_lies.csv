television,fqyx2za,t1_fqyu42z,1589756045.0,">It's baffling to me that so many corporations end up folding because of those morons cutting every corner they can for some temporary short-term gains. It should be obvious that having a continuing standard for your business is a cornerstone of success, \*EVEN IF YOUR STANDARD IS MEDIOCRITY\*. Why else would fast food chains survive? Cheap fashion stores? Convenience stores?

At a certain point you realize your industry or business model is dying, and you aren't going to get new customers. Cable TV is there now, think Blockbuster, Kodak, magazine publishers, etc.

At that point, your whole industry is dead in the water. You've already lost the game, but there is still money to be made temporarily. Only your die hard customers are still there - the ones too rich, or set in their ways, or stupid to change. So you just MILK those suckers left on your platform for as much as you can - increase prices, cut costs, etc., for as long as you can take - squeeze every last drop.

That's how business works. (not necessarily defending it, but that's how it is)."
