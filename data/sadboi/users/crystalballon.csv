So give it the benefit of the doubt.  Please look up the difference between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. For as far as I know bipolar disorder has cycles between manic and depressive episodes, and you can have it for as long as you live. Borderline personality disorder usually starts in puberty, as a result of trauma/instability in childhood Also with borderline personality disorder there are no cycles, but the emotions are extremely intense and all over the place and can switch through minor triggers multiple times a day. From what you were telling here in this post I read that most of these intense emotions started around puberty, and that there is no cycle between manic and depressed episodes, but that you have extreme emotions that are all over the place and switch many times. To me, this sounds more like borderline personality disorder. I am diagsnodes with bpd as well and I too have a very instable mom so that might have had an influence on it as well. Of course I can not diagnose you and maybe I don‚Äôt fully understand bipolar disorder, bit this might be something to look into, it might help you :)"

I would very much advice you to research these disorders and go see a psychiatrist if you recognise yourself in the disorders. Having a diagnosis won‚Äôt solve your problems, but it might give you some insight as to why this is happening and how you can help yourself just so your live becomes liveable. 
Note; you might not recognise yourself in aspergers but look it up, the signs are very different in girls and look more like borderline traits. That‚Äôs why it is often overlooked. Please do not diagnose yourself but research is always a good first step. Just know that you are not alone ‚ô•Ô∏è"

unpopularopinion,f5r6dlk,t1_f5r5eb0,1572388930.0,"Not every mental illness is cureable and even if they are not every person is able to, even if they want it. The problem with mental illness is that it is in your brain. If it would be in your leg nobody would call you out for staying at home but because it is your brain you must be exaggerating. That‚Äôs just not the case. I understand the frustration of people acting like they don‚Äôt want to get better or not taking active steps to get better, but honestly, in many cases this is part of the disease. Part of depression, for example, is losing motivation for anything and being hopeless. It‚Äôs not so weird then, that people who are clinically depressed are not actively trying to get better. They can when they are in a better state of mind, and they will, because most people don‚Äôt want to be depressed anymore when they finally see a glimpse of what normal life feels like. I completely understand that from a neurotypical perspective, these people seem like some lazy fuckers that just don‚Äôt want to do anything and use their illness as an excuse, but most of the time it‚Äôs part of their illness and it is not as simple as what you like to imply. I know because I‚Äôve been on both sides."

Yes, there are bad people in every part of life, and yes, there are people faking mental illness and using it as an excuse, but this are nearly not as many people as there are people with actual mental illnesses suffering from people like you denying their need for space, help, and compassion."

dating,f32mhfk,t3_dfazai,1570617896.0,"[21FM] Hey, first of all I want to say that dating can be scary, and it will be even more if you feel like you‚Äôve been left out of dating your entire life and have no sense of attractiveness, and probably also no sense of what you want in a girl or how you are in a relationship. Now I can give you all this advise on how to get a girl, but I think it‚Äôs way more important that you get comfortable hanging around girls, talking to girls, flirting and feeling that you have something to bring to the table. So my advise would be: Stop trying to find a girlfriend for a while and start actually meeting women and talking to them and make some friends. Girls will know that you are desperate for love and most girls do not like feeling this pressure, so try and make some friends first. Work on your confidence. If you want to know if people find you attractive, you can ask them on tinder, but if you really want to meet people, go out in the real world. Build your social skills, then your confidence will grow with it. And so will your change of finding a girl."

The most important things for me when I was a small child; I had a set of caregivers that made me go into contact with other people than my mom. I went to fostercare and to this very day I think it helped me achieve my ability to be social. Also the moments of rest were so important to me. Make sure his bed is big enough, I couldn‚Äôt sleep because of so many reasons in the bedroom. Make sure he has a huge sleeping routine. For me it was very clear that if we did the whole routine, I was going to sleep. Make sure the bedroom is dark enough, quiet enough and a safe place. Don‚Äôt feed him textures that make him puke; it‚Äôs not worth it. Keep giving him the change to try everything tho, because he might be afraid of trying new things out of fear. And of course, have a lot of one on one playtime with the kid. There‚Äôs a change your kid is extremely intelligent and wants to learn - a lot.

Drugs,et3ptsw,t3_c9l61j,1562437219.0,Same yesterday I cried because I saw a pot with flowers and I felt such an amazing feeling of gratitude and love for these flowers that it made me  cry. Also I bumped my knee to the wall accidentally and it made me cry because it hurt just a tiny bit but I didn't want to damage my knee or the wall so I cried a little. Also the crying felt kinda good.
AskReddit,esuakak,t1_estjk4j,1562280519.0,For me this is the biggest one. I know so many guys who try to gain weight and are afraid of not looking strong enough like honestly some people look absolutely stunning skinny. My ex was amazing skinny and now he tries to gain weight idk I think he looked better before

By our parents, classmates, friends and family, we have been told we need to be a cretain way. Also by the media and massive advertising, it starts with children that learn about princesses and superheroes and so on. It‚Äôs not just media. It‚Äôs stories that have been told for centuries."
BPD,esbtazm,t3_c6x5um,1561810390.0,"Same, sometimes I realise that I actually gathered all these toxic people around me myself, as if I actually want to get hurt. All the boyfrieds I‚Äôve had were toxic in a way. I think that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm attracted to."
Drugs,esboa2u,t3_c6x80d,1561803292.0,"Trourists will get ripped off. I‚Äôd suggest go out of the city buy your ket there then go back to amsterdam. Why bother trying coke, it sucks compared to molly or any other drug I‚Äôve tried.  Just know good coke is fucking expensive in the Netherlands because it‚Äôs one of the few drugs that have to be imported. XTC is good in here because we made it. So for good cocaine you pay around 40-50 euros per gram, ketamine is usually around 30 euros per gram. If you are really going to buy in amsterdam go test your shit. You know, for me it‚Äôs different because I live here and know the specific guys that are good but for tourists is shit and the dealers know you‚Äôre a tourist."
