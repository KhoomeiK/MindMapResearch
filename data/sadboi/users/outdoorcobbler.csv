SuicideWatch,fqw0ilp,t1_fqw02pt,1589689547.0,"People say suicide is selfish. I think it's selfish for healthy people to demand sick people to stay alive when every fiber in their being says to die. I'm sorry you went through that... But it's my right to die. It's not about if anyone cares. My husband loves me very much, but he doesn't realize the burden that's going to be lifted from his shoulders once I'm gone."
SuicideWatch,fqvzq43,t1_fqvzixa,1589688977.0,I'm drunk enough for the bravery I need to do this. My husband is too drunk to help me. I'm alone now.
SuicideWatch,fqvxcjy,t3_gl76g3,1589687344.0,I appreciate the PMs from people. Truly. I just don't want to be talked out of anything or told it gets better. I've done this long enough and made up my mind. I only posted here because this is as close to a suicide note as anyone is gonna get from me.

SuicideWatch,fqsaxxo,t3_gkk25a,1589602558.0,"I feel this deep. I have a hard time wrapping my head around why I shouldn't be allowed the same freedom to die that others have to live. Or why some people think humane euthanasia is okay for old people with terminal cancer, but not for someone with terminal depression. Because that's a fucking thing, too."

We'll never be the same."
SuicideWatch,fqo4221,t3_gjzlpr,1589507139.0,"Depends on how you want to go, what you're willing to suffer, who will find you... Hanging is normally clean, and quick if you do it right. Guns are best, but messy and scarring for those you leave behind. Overdoses are actually good if you can get the right drugs. I personally have a bottle of xanax, unisom, and gentleman's jack to put me to sleep. That's how I'm going out."
AMA,fqnr55f,t1_fqnamza,1589499858.0,"It was my grandmother and dad. No, she died with her racism, and my dad is still racist af. Although, I stumbled onto his porn collection once and found out he has a thing for black women. He caught holy hell over that, and I still rub his nose in it."

AMA,fqnktre,t1_fqnha5z,1589496657.0,"I wasn't brave. I fell apart. I've been depressed and suicidal most of my life. The only real redemption I find is in encouraging people to be kind to each other, and keeping my kids safe. I now have a daughter, and even though I know my son isn't my brother, I have zero trust in leaving them alone together. I can't get it out of my head. Sometimes I blame my parents more than my brother. At least in some sense, he was a kid too. They didn't protect him, either."
AMA,fqnjr1o,t1_fqnj5kz,1589496098.0,"I have contact with my dad. Everyone else disowned me after I pressed charges and he went to jail the first time. My son is 11. I thought I'd never tell him, but we actually did about a month ago. He kept asking questions, and he was old enough to have at least some concept of what rape is. Me and my husband sat him down and told him, and he actually handled it better than I thought. I'm kinda glad I told him young. Better now than when he's an adult and things hit harder. But we ended the talk with my husband popping the adoption question, so all things considered, it went well."
AMA,fqnhb97,t1_fqndmdv,1589494846.0,"Nope. And thank God. My husband is in the process of trying to legally adopt my son, and if my brother had paid child support, it would've made it messy. There's also a gag order in place. Child support would've meant having to deal with him and him knowing where we live. The better, safer option for us was keeping him uninvolved."
AMA,fqnh2m6,t1_fqncwy8,1589494723.0,"I didn't have that option. I was 17, and our town had about 300 people in it. My dad, after covering it up for years, said no adoption and no abortion. I had no advocate, didn't know what to do... It all turned out okay, and he's not a constant reminder. I'm glad he's here."
AMA,fqnbiav,t1_fqnb3ks,1589491931.0,"Even now, I don't really know. He swears up and down that he had no idea it was going on, but socials workers and cops were at our house twice, and the third time I got my mom involved. So he definitely knew. I think he probably just didn't know how bad it was, and didn't want to acknowledge it. But I tell myself that my brother was his kid, too. It doesn't excuse it. It's just what I have to tell myself to get by."
AMA,fqnaxxt,t1_fqn9kut,1589491653.0,"He's fine. He has ADHD, but that's not from his genetics. 
My brother had the type of bipolar disorder that encouraged hypersexuality. When I was 11, we got Internet and a computer for the first time. The only place to plug it up was in my room (because back then, it was just dial up). He would sneak in there at night to get on it. Whether someone told him about it or he found it out for himself, he started looking up porn. And I think that's what started it. 
I told a teacher, and social services got involved. But it was a small town, my dad was dating a social worker at the time, and I think she made it go away. I tried to report it three different times, and was always turned down. My parents were divorced, and my dad worked late. It was a perfect storm."
AMA,fqn9xki,t3_gjt687,1589491160.0,"My very racist dad and grandmother used to tell me that mixed people were out of place because blacks didn't want them, and neither did whites. Do you encounter any racism from people you share a race with because you're mixed?"

SuicideWatch,fqn84i0,t1_fqklncj,1589490273.0,"Mine fired me for noncompliance, even after putting me on a medication and urging me to stop breastfeeding so I could take it. She put me on this and mailed the letter with no follow-up on a brand new medication or how the side effects were. And I stopped breastfeeding, just like she asked. But I was noncompliant. I'm sure that happens where patients get dropped because of the provider's inadequacy, but that's absolutely not the case even the majority of the time. Most of them are just fucking stupid."
AskReddit,fqn7n6v,t1_fqlev0m,1589490039.0,"If you mean that it's my problem because I haven't told him, DO YOU THINK I HAVEN'T TRIED?!?

SuicideWatch,fqkdgn5,t3_gjdojr,1589425016.0,"Don't send her away. 
Please. As someone who went through it, I'm more traumatized for the experience. I have nightmares at least once a week about that place. And my husband sent me there, so it's thrown a silent wrench into our marriage that we can never remove. I'm very close to committing suicide, and my husband has no idea because it's something we can never talk about again. She'll never trust you if you do this. And her best bet to stay alive is her ability to tell someone. Stay with her, or get someone to stay with her if the breakup was sour. But I'm telling you, I wouldn't wish that hell on my worst of enemies. I would honest to God tell someone to kill himself before subjecting himself to that. I love my husband, but I'll never forgive him. I can't."
SuicideWatch,fqkcr99,t3_gjdofy,1589424608.0,"You know what? I'm married to an amazing man. But fuck if I haven't fallen for Michael from Grand Theft Auto V. Like, full legitimate wish-he-was-real-but-kinda-glad-he-isn't-because-I-might-cheat crush. It's not as weird as you think... I believe I have a crush because I see something in him that I want or need in real life that I'm not getting.  It sounds like that's the case with you, too. I wouldn't get too worked up over it. 
I also didn't find my husband until I was 27. I'd long decided I would end up alone, because I'm no one's prize. I wouldn't give up yet. People always told me that, and I'm like, I already have. She'll show up eventually. Don't try so hard."

I don't have anything to offer you other than a virtual nod, and to let you know you aren't the only one. I'm very sorry for what you're going through. I'm done myself and I've met my end.

AskReddit,fqk8ugp,t3_gj3q9d,1589422389.0,"How about being excessively wasteful? I ordered birthday wrapping paper and scotch tape from Walmart, and they sent the paper roll in a damn 3'Ã—5' box, and the tape in one not much smaller than that. Fucksticks."

SuicideWatch,fqk7evs,t3_gj06ga,1589421586.0,"Man, me too. This is just based on my beliefs, but... If I have to live forever, whether in heaven or hell, I can never stop existing. And it's not fair. I didn't ask to exist, I don't want to exist, and I'll never truly find rest. Depression has given me a really screwed up relationship with God, and I don't think I can ever be a real Christian because I'm wired wrong for the job. So I was fucked before I was even born."
SuicideWatch,fpyrr8i,t3_gfsv5a,1589008353.0,"I've been saying this for years, but different reason. I think at some point, you're beyond help. And none of that stuff fixes reality. Is it supposed to help you cope with reality? Is that the goal? I don't understand it. I went to therapy for about a year, and got way worse in the process. I didn't even feel a little better until I got out of there.
Anyway... The people telling you it helps weren't too far gone when they tried therapy. And not saying you are, because I don't know. Just speaking for me, as someone who is, that it's pointless. And dangerous if you're suicidal, because they will lock you up with zero fucks given. I actually have a touch of PTSD from my experience in psych jail, and I still have nightmares from time to time.
It's all a fucking joke."
SuicideWatch,foye5mj,t3_ga7v3b,1588170878.0,"I never was, and never have been.

GrandTheftAutoV,foydtv7,t3_g8hfi9,1588170703.0,"Update:  Bought the game for PS4. Can't play it. Can't even get past the second mission, and it won't let you customize controls or use cheats. *sigh* I need to stick to Kingdom Hearts, I guess. I'm just not a gamer. Thanks anyway."
GrandTheftAutoV,fosqh04,t1_forvl3d,1588035938.0,"Ah. I didn't realize it was on Xbox, but I should've known that. The other GTAs were, I believe. I never really cared for xbox controls, either. I didn't play video games for like ten years, and stopped playing about the time ps2 started phasing out. I like the oldschool gaming like SNES and emulators and stuff, but I just don't care for the new stuff. I think it's because (just my opinion) gaming has gotten flashier as technology has progressed, so actual gameplay has gotten more difficult as game makers are using almost the same controllers they were ten years ago, but trying to get you to do ten times as much with them. And I like a game I can play without taking it too seriously. I'm just an old lady. ðŸ˜‚"

And then they don't even make it controller compatible. It's asinine. But I realize that the only way I can really play V is going to be on PC."
GrandTheftAutoV,foroiom,t1_foqj06r,1588015732.0,"Yeah, I realized after looking it up that you didn't mean you could pick the games you wanted for free. lol but thanks! I downloaded them anyway for my husband. I was pretty happy to see GTA V for only $15 on there, so we're gonna get it. Worst case scenario, I can't win it, but it's a big enough game that I can still enjoy it."
GrandTheftAutoV,fopyatb,t1_fooxm5l,1587976264.0,"Thanks so much! I think I'm gonna actually go download it right now. Especially if I can get it for free. I wish I had known about the trio deal, though. I paid $18 for SA on Steam for the crap controls."

GrandTheftAutoV,foo4d2k,t1_fonmk4c,1587932259.0,"Like I said, I'm not a gamer at all. I probably wouldn't do online if I didn't have to. I just wanna play alone.
I'm currently trying to play SA all the way through, and never beat it before. I'm stuck at the flying and driving school, and the Zero missions. I've given up. As far as I'm concerned, they can't be done on PC. Are there any missions as difficult as those on V? I know everyone's talents and skills vary, but just speaking on your opinion."
Miscarriage,fo6kpjh,t1_fo6h1y7,1587561186.0,"Yeah... I think if I keep telling myself there was no baby to lose, it's just my brain trying to deny reality. And that's not going to get me anywhere. Sorry for your loss."

I'm rh negative and had to get it for my first, but you're protected after that. It also depends on your husband's blood type if it's even an issue. If he's rh negative too, you don't even need the shot. That's all to say, no, that's not what caused your miscarriage. And it won't necessarily prevent them in the future. But always ask your OB what they think.
I'm sorry you're going through this. We miscarried Monday, and I feel like an open wound myself. I also had to sit in the ER alone, and being extremely needle phobic and having bad anxiety, it's a wonder I made it without getting locked up somewhere."

1.  In this day and age, it is not necessary to bug the crap out of your neighbors to translate something.
2.  For all you know, they could be trying to learn Chinese. That is a Flippin hard language to learn.
3.  Maybe instead of being the a****** in the story, you could have gotten them a book for type something up for them. Common phrases and the such. And then after that, if they still kept bugging you to translate stuff, then your actions would have been Justified."
gamedev,f023ad3,t1_f01nxih,1568322693.0,"That's a good idea. I'm really debating on how to go about it the best way. I'm wondering if I shouldn't just maybe stick to one subject, like have the main character be a mathematician or something, and make math the main focus of the game. And I could do that for all the subjects. I don't know how to best incorporate all the subjects into one game. Actually, just typing that gave me the idea of making each main character like a different specialist. I could have a scientist, a historian... I don't know, there's lots of different ways to do it. But I just know if I do it wrong, I'm going to be wasting a lot of time on it, because he won't do it. But I like your idea of maybe trying to do it together. And especially like the idea of having to do math to determine damage.

This could be a lot of fun. I'm kind of excited about making it. We'll just have to see how it goes. If all else fails and he absolutely hates it, I guess I'll save it for when my daughter is old enough to start homeschool. LOL"
