I like to be free of their burden tho, so  I remove them as often as they show up, most of the time it requires mental gun-fu (lots of weapon conjuring and dancing with blades)"

And psychedelic hallucinations showed me a few things I needed to achieve on my own (the fighting part)...I had a ghost in me that was always playing the iron man 3 theme song for like a month ...it drove me nuts, but eventually I kicked him out far enough that he never returned lol"
schizophrenia,fknzsdn,t3_fjjk0k,1584377266.0,"during stages of psychosis, it can feel you have transdimensional awareness and can visually see things that aren't physically there and audible hallucinations...but how you react to them is going to determine how bad of a symptom you create during these strange times.   I learned to let everything happen and everything is temporary and emotions I can jump into and out of at will now so nothing bothers me as a diagnosed schizo affective/bipolar/ptsd.   I had a few episodes that put me into a hospital for yelling at people too much during my psychosis stages...because of that, I got put on abilify shot and I don't have the mania anymore, but I also take like 2 naps a day now and smoke too much weed during the day...just stay focused on you and learn to react positively to things even if they seem out there"

A way of interpreting all the trans dimensional awareness you have woken to....the glossary is funny too: if the voices tell you to kill yourself TUrn to page XX lol  if the voices tell you you're god or jesus turn to page XXX ...fun stuff for beginners to laugh at and even the adepts will have a few pages of tricks to try on removing all the spiritual buildup of life forces within

But I've been medicated so I can sleep normal again.   I love the energy at first, but then it wears out your body and you crave sleep, knowing you can't is frustratingAF ...
