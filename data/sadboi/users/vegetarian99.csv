From what you wrote I can already tell that ur an amazing selfless person, and honestly, you deserve the best life has to offer ALWAYS. If this guy does not make you happy, don't do it. Have a logical talk with ur parents, be sharp (as mentioned above), and above all stay calm. You will get through this."

If you're very concerned health-wise, you can do stuff like taking a break and going on walks with friends (or alone), trying nice healthy recipes that would motivate u to eat better, and be KIND TO YOURSELF. This is normal, you are going through a LOT rn. GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK!"
