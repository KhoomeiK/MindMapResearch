I think the same way about death sometimes. I try to remind myself that I have had to fight to reclaim what little resemblance of a ""normal"" life I have now and to hold onto the hope that it will get better over time. 

Sure I feel hopeless quite a bit, but I try to remind myself of the progress I have made and I almost dream of how I'd like to be in the future. Even though the future is one of the hardest things for us sufferers to think about imo.

Take care and I hope when you pull through this you come out on top! Exactly where you deserve to be!"

Thanks again!!!!"

In a sexualizing/fantasizing way towards a stranger? I don't think I have but I guess that's ultimately up to that person and how it made them feel. In all honesty I only feel like i did this in established relationships or if a woman sent out obvious signs. If that makes any sense.

In my childhood I witnessed my dad's abuse towards women first hand and that may be why. He would also force me to watch graphic adult movies (and discuss what was going on) and drink with him. I am sure that had a lot to do with it because even at that young of an age I knew everything about those situations were wrong. 

If this isn't any different, please point it out and know i meant no offense to anyone. I have never had this discussion on a public forum but I am always open to new perspectives. I feel that's one major way we grow as human beings."

My disassociation has been horrible lately (this didn't help any) and it's a mental fight to muster up the focus to make it through a 40 hour work week. Any chance I get to space out. I take it.

Shitstatistssay,fik9qxb,t3_f8a3fa,1582476008.0,"I've worked for state run hospitals and privately run hospitals. The stark differences between the two are insane. 

The private/charity hospital I work for now will pay for whatever the patient needs even if they don't have insurance at no cost to them. Patients seem happier and more optimistic. Staff is not overworked or given more than they can handle. Which in turn does nothing but give patients a leg up in their recovery.

State run was horribly managed and essentially ran by the seat of it's pants. Felt like it was just herding cattle in and out. The people who didn't work were never reprimanded. The people who actually worked and cared had all that extra work put on them. 

My experience from working at both actually helped to change my political views. It opened my eyes to the fact that I wouldn't trust the state to manage a McDonald's."

CPTSD,fgy9l8p,t3_f0klu3,1581180949.0,"I did kind of. My dad would withhold food and not fix dinner until around midnight at the earliest. If I was feeling brave I'd wait until he got in the shower and shove food in my face and sneak my little bro some food too and hope to God he didn't notice. If he did notice my ""dinner was ruined"". Then when it was dinner time he would intentionally give me more than I could finish and proceed to shit talk me until I cried or forced the food down.

When my wife wakes me up she has to shake my foot because i have almost swung at her multiple times (as a child I woke up to my drunk dad standing over me with a gun in my face). I am in the early stages of therapy, so I'm sorry i can't give you any guidance. Sometimes it is just nice to know you aren't alone and other people struggle with the same symptoms.

Currently I am mostly struggling with anger for no known reason and feeling like I am faking it. As far as feeling like we are faking it, I think it is our brain trying to suppress it so we can carry on. Just my non-medically trained opinion.

God bless and I wish you the strength to get through this!

Also, there are some books out there that are specifically for the significant others of survivors. I bought my wife [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608827860/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) book and it has seemed to help her understand what i (and her as well) go through and things they can do to help."
