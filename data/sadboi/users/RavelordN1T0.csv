""Richard hath a swift hand  
He can look upon the hall and tell thee his plan  
He hath a smoking pipe  
Hanging from his mouth he's a Knight kid, ye  
He hath found'th a longbow  
In his Pa's chest, obscured 'th a box of odd baubles  
And I do nae know what  
But he shalt challenge thee, he shalt challenge thee  

All thee other folk with thyne plate sabatons shall best make haste, best make haste, outrun my bow.  
All thee other folk with thyne plate sabatons shall best make haste, best make haste, faster than my arrows.  

Pa work'th a long day  
He shalt cometh home late, he shalt cometh home late  
And he shalt bring'th me a surprise  
A feast is in the banquet, and it's packed in ice  
I hath waited for an age  
The sleight of my hand is now a swift-nock arrow  
I reason with my smoking pipe  
And say ""thyne hair's ablaze, thou hath lost thyne wits"" ye  

All thee other folk with thyne plate sabatons shall best make haste, best make haste, outrun my bow.  
All thee other folk with thyne plate sabatons shall best make haste, best make haste, faster than my arrows."""
