SDSGrandCross,fple7ln,t1_fplamrl,1588711127.0,"I’ve been told by a lot of people already that bking should be in front line and g merlin in back, but that works much worse since my bking is ALWAYS killed turn 1 by enemy esc, while merlin often survives. I knew though that there had to be something wrong with my team because you don’t plan for one of your characters dying if you want to win (esp if you’re using ult rush synergies). When I tried to use esc, I couldn’t win due to not going first, but I understand that that’s due to my units not being 75.

I think I prefer the esc team due to esc being more developed than helbram, also bc it helps win battles faster. Thanks for telling me that 94k cc is prob enough to go first. Do you know about how much cc u get from leveling units from 70 to 75? I need 4K more cc according to your numbers. If my cc is still too low to achieve 1st turn, should I use cc boost food rather than ult burst food?"

Current roster is r art/ r gow/ g Merlin sub b king. All level 70, 6 stars, Arthur is 5/6 ult, Gowthur is 2/6, rest are 1/6 ult.

I also have level 70 6 star g escanor but idk where he fits on the team.

Bc my luck is insane I just pulled r helbram trying to get a 2nd escanor, so I also have level 1 unascended helbram.

I have 13 SSR pendants, so I can evolve 4 units to 75 or get helbram to 70 and one guy to 75.

I’m really obsessed with getting those 2 months off because the last time I was happy, I was a kid and the highlight of my life was the summer vacation.
