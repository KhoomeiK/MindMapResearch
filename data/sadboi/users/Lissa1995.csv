Makeup,ewy3znu,t3_cqot7r,1565874175.0,"Yes it’s a huge struggle, I’m like on my second year of playing with makeup. I’m still discovering looks and such, some hits and many misses.  Why not read reviews/ or just ask people around you about the product that you are looking into. Maybe I don’t like the same mascara as you or you don’t like the foundation that I love. 

We are all different when it comes to makeup brands, makeup styles,, and other aspects of this art."

relationship_advice,ev8b4ac,t3_cioqq0,1564274373.0,I’m blind too however my family never did that kind of stuff to me . They treated me like i was normal. For those of you who are saying that he has abandonment issues yes he does quite a bit but it’s because his mom committed suicide when he was just five years old. He didn’t find out until you was 30 years old about his real mom. Him living with this fast to prize for most of his young life really affected him. All through dating him and the first months of marriage I was telling Health that he is worth something he has potential and everyone has a purpose in life. I think he still in the back of his mind stores that negatively.
relationship_advice,ev8a16r,t3_cioqq0,1564273471.0,"He has a family with parents who abused him mentally and sometimes physically. They would tell him that he’s not worth anything because he’s blind and an adopted child. So his ego is non existent. I don’t mind being with him but sometimes I just want my space. When I’m washing dishes he gets behind me like every 10 minutes. Every time I go to the restroom he follows. I get up and get a glass of water and then he asks hey, “  where did you go?”"
