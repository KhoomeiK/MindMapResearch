Typically your doctor will suggest waiting 2 weeks just to make sure it is absolutely safe.

It takes under 10 minutes. They make a small incision and insert it into the underside of your arm. No stitches required, they use steri-strips to close the incision.

> Is the procedure especially painful?

It really depends on your doctor. The doctor that did the initial insertion was just beginning in her field and -- as such -- was really quick to administer the numbing agent which ended up being the painful part of it (because when it goes in it can feel like it's lighting your nerves on fire). When I got my Nexplanon removed I had an older woman take it out and she said the trick to the numbing agent is to release it slowly, I didn't feel anything when she did it.

Not especially, they place it sort of underneath your arm in an orientation where you usually won't have anything pressing against it. 

Not saying Nexplanon is 100% bad. It does exactly what it suggests: which is keeping you from getting pregnant, but a common side effect is bleeding nonstop and weight gain. My suggestion would be to talk to your gynecologist and ask them what they recommend."

Here is a small point of reference for how many ml different glasses typically hold: https://www.web4student.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/size-of-glasses-cups.jpg

To contract hyponatremia, you would need to drink enough water in a condensed amount of time that your bodys' sodium level lowers due to tissue not being able to absorb fluids and not urinating to flush out the excess.

As for the cyst, (depending on your doctor) they may want you to wait it out for awhile and have you come back in for another scan to see if the cyst resolves itself. Usually ovarian cysts will resolve without intervention, but sometimes if they get too big they will want to extract it before ovarian torsion occurs (think of when a flower head gets too big and the stem is small.

They paraded his corpse around town on a wagon and had his body stand at attention in front of the houses of the families he had killed. An enraged citizen at one point even climbed on the wagon and forced the head of his corpse to face the victims' home. The coachman even supposedly whipped the corpse across the face three times.

""*When the cart came opposite the late Mr Marr's house a halt was made for nearly a quarter of an hour. ... The procession then advanced to St George's Turnpike, where the New Road [now Commercial Road] is intersected by Cannon Street Road. Those who accompanied the procession arrived at a grave already dug six feet down. The remains of John Williams were tumbled out of the cart and lowered into this hole, and then someone hammered a stake through his heart.*""

— Thomas De Quincey

Oh yeah, and because there really wasn't a standard for dealing with murders during this era -- murder-sightseeing was popular and there was a large entertainment culture that surrounded it. The bodies of the victims would be left for the jury to view, but until they'd arrive you'd have complete strangers touring through each room of your house and gaping at your dead body. In the instance of John Williams' victims, one of the members of the family that were gawked at was an infant that had their throat sliced open. People would also buy Broadsides (think a single article dedicated to just the specific murder) and would attend the funeral services even if they had no connections to the deceased.

WomensHealth,ep6bzsb,t3_btuud0,1559067127.0,"Hi! I've been using a Lena cup for about 5 years now! :)

> How do they work like not leak?

Essentially it works by creating a seal inside of you, it's not a tight seal mind you because that would be uncomfortable -- but it's designed to rest against your vaginal walls so that any blood that goes around the cup when inserted properly wouldn't leak out.

> Can you take it out and dump it without getting your hands bloody?

It's possible, but really depends on the shape of your uterus. I have what is referred to as a ""tilted uterus"" and it is shallower than an average womans'. So I have had to cut the stem off the bottom of my cup and instead I just pinch the bottom to remove it. I would say all in all it makes about the same amount of mess on your hands that you would get from wearing a tampon upon removal (mind you this is with a stemless cup though!)

> Do you just dump it out and put it back in? Or do you use another one and wash it every use?

In a private restroom where the sink is nearby yes dump it, rinse it, and put it back in-- just rinse it with water once you have take it out. In public restrooms you can just reinsert it right away! In either case you will just use the same one. There's no need to switch cups every time you take it out.

> How do you wash it?

Some companies sell cleaning solution specifically for cups, but after my cycle is complete I have always put my cup in a pan of boiling water that's mixed with a little bit of vinegar and let it go for about a minute before removing and letting it dry on a paper towel.

> Is there a difference between the diva cup and off brands?

It's all a matter of different patented shapes. The difference in shapes and firmness levels depends on your comfort, some people who are more sensitive might have to try several different types of brands to find their best match. They also may hold different volumes of bodily fluid depending on the brand.

Best of luck! I absolutely love my cups! I have never liked using tampons because they have always been uncomfortably dry, and pads also made me feel uncomfortable because I could feel I was sitting on my own discharge, so this has taken out a lot of those hidden inconveniences of menstrual products (the only thing I have to worry about now is cramps).

AskReddit,eod3oyi,t3_br3n8o,1558468006.0,"Something a teacher told me once that has always stuck with me is how one of the hardest social skills for people to learn is saying ""thank you"" and receiving a compliment.

Part of the issue is when someone says ""Oh hey, I like  ____ about you"" in a normal social setting, we tend to think owning it makes us seem full of ourselves, so we adamantly reject it and try harder to deny it because we think it makes us seem more modest. You see this a lot when someone compliments your appearance or skill because the default response becomes ""oh no. I'm pretty ugly/I'm not very good at it at all."" But the catch 22 is that it doesn't come off modest. Instead, it tells that person they need to to try harder to compliment you -- suddenly a compliment that should be brief gratification turns into a long, drawn-out argument where the other person suddenly have to provide you compelling evidence as to why they like something about you. It suddenly makes giving a compliment seem like effort.

There are modest ways of also accepting compliments that won't be perceived as ""fishing"". The easiest way is to say ""aww, thank you!"" and leave it at that. Or else if you want to talk more about it, you can introduce it as a topic of conversation. I also understand that low self-esteem can also be a factor, but a lot of the time it's the perception that we can never own when someone likes something about us because we fear it make us look too full of ourselves, but denying it can also have the same effect."
