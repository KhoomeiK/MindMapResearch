We spoke again last night, and he was feeling very bad about it (but I also have a tendency to harp on something if I feel like it wasn’t resolved- when I really should just be patient and know that it takes time).

relationship_advice,fbwwl9u,t1_fbwvm9x,1577161393.0,"I’ve pushed back a lot, but it’s almost like he doesn’t register. The other day we had a talk about it and he said he wouldn’t make those comments anymore and he was saying things like “you’re doing a great job today” and I knew he meant it. 

But I think what’s challenging me the most, is how there have been things in the past I didn’t like and we’d talk about it and I’d basically put it in an analogy format (my default mode of communication lol) and he’d actually sit back and understand it and I could definitely tell her understood and he changed. With this, he seems to be digging his heels in. He has gotten upset with how much I’m working and how I should “sign off” but this short opportunity has been HUGE for me career wise- which he understands- and I’ve been really trying to take advantage of it. It just seems so odd to me that I’m not seeing him “understand” it like he had with other topics we’ve had to resolve in the past. Which makes me wonder if i am just not communicating it in a way that is registering to him"
relationship_advice,fbww5hy,t1_fbwv96c,1577161055.0,"I spend most of the weekend running around doing stuff. I like to be busy, and I’ve asked him to get stuff for me before and he will do it, but I also am somewhat of a control freak- so that’s another element that, in his defense, is not easy. So he always says “well you enjoy doing that stuff!” Which is true, but I think the biggest pain point is that I’m happy to do all sorts of stuff to stay busy- I just don’t want to get shit on because I didn’t make it to the gym. 

We used to go to a gym about 15 mins away from us. I used to go in the morning before work before we got our puppy. But the puppy made things a lot busier which we anticipated. This gym was about $80 a month (for both so $40 each). I stopped going just because of time, but there is a gym less than 5 minutes away that I suggested we switch to because it’s so much closer, and it’s also $40 total ($20 a month). He was hesitant but agreed. 

We switched about a week before thanksgiving, and I found out then I had to go to Asia for a week. He was giving me a hard time because “I made such a stink about how we should go to this closer gym and that I’d go” and how “I’ve gone like twice”. It’s been about 5 weeks or so since we joined- 1 week was thanksgiving week and 1 week I was in Asia. I was swamped with work, got sick right before I traveled, and had to complete all of my Christmas shopping. 

I feel like you might be right about the career thing- he’s pretty unhappy with his job (yet doesn’t do anything to change it aside from sent me job postings and asks if I can help with his resume). 

He’s a very kind person, and has a heart of gold. I’m not sure if he’s feeling a lot of pressure and reacting by being defensive, but I feel like every way I’ve tried to express how much it sucks to feel like I have no support here (which he says he’s very proud of me and supports me), but it seems like he doesn’t actually “get it”. But I wonder if it’s intimidating that I’m at a much different point in my career than he is, and he comes from a very traditional family where the father was the breadwinner and the mom worked for a short time before being a full time stay at home mom. He says he’s proud, but I wonder if it might be something else."
relationship_advice,fbwvehb,t1_fbwuwu8,1577160463.0,"In his defensive, a lot of the chores and errands are for myself- since I don’t like to do shopping and stuff on the weeknights after work, and I do laundry on the weekends. I also do a lot of “housekeeping” stuff- like shopping for house things if we need new towels, or other random stuff. Holiday decorations, etc. stuff that basically if I didn’t leave here he wouldn’t have lol. He says he “doesn’t care about that stuff”, but I definitely think he’d hate if the house was completely bare and looked abandoned. 

But a lot of it is catching up on laundry, picking up prescriptions, going to appointments, grocery shopping, cleaning my stuff, etc. The kind of stuff that, because he’s home all day and has somewhat of a flexible schedule, he can get done periodically throughout the week, but I can’t."
relationship_advice,fbwuuxa,t1_fbwt4lu,1577160055.0,"These are very good points. I’ve mentioned them a couple times to him, however, he has the ultimate retort: “well I’m at home with the dog all day every day” (we have a very, very high energy puppy). This immediately makes me feel guilty because I understand how much work she is. That being said, we both agreed to that. 

He does get super defensive if I ever say anything about him or his work ethic. I really don’t say anything, because of his responses. It’s very much a “pot calling the kettle black” situation because he will have the audacity to tell me I eat bad (I cook, but I’m not an adventurous eater) yet will never offer to cook. With the gym, I mentioned how it would be great if he would be more supportive like “hey let’s go together” and he says that “I shouldn’t need him to make myself motivated”. 

Even though we’ve been together for a while, he still seems to be “learning” how to communicate with me. We have our disagreements, and it’s amazing how long it takes him sometimes to come around. But he does. With this, I just don’t know if it’s something he’s just unable to comprehend, or if he’s struggling with something else (like the fact that we are in very different points of our careers)."
relationship_advice,fbwudqs,t1_fbwsx80,1577159693.0,"Yeah I think you’re exactly right. This is something I definitely need to work through, because this uptick in responsibility at work has been huge for me and my career/exposure, but it comes with a price. It’s the first real time I’ve been able to stand out in a large company, so I’ve been so absorbed in it. It’s also only been happening since October and should be dying down soon. My SO also knows this, and knows that I was handed this huge responsibility very last minute due to turnover, and that it was a major opportunity to advance my career. 

It just doesn’t seem to help when my SO makes negative comments about it; if I get accolades at work for doing well on a presentation or something, yet come home to be criticized about how I don’t go to the gym, I immediately flock back to my work. It’s a bad cycle of events."

askwomenadvice,f4hcgb8,t3_dkh69a,1571590186.0,"UGH this is the worst. Had this situation. Friend (X) who I’ve known literally my entire life (28 now). 

Ironically enough, X went through a break up earlier this year (I set her up with a friend of my boyfriend, and thought they would be great together but I think they were actually too similar). I felt terrible when they broke up since I set them up (they were together for about 1.5 years). X was blowing me up (it was a work day so i would try my best to respond but when I leave a meeting with 24 texts from one person, it’s going to take me a little while to read them all). I told her “whatever you need, I can come over after work and bring dinner, etc”. She blew that off and said “yeah maybe next week”. But I ended the conversation with “I want you to know I’m here for you; this isn’t a question- you are my friend first and whatever you need”. She never responded. 

A day later, our mutual friend asked me if I was going to HH with X. I said no ?? And was super surprised because the mutual friend rarely hung out with X. I told the mutual friend how I offered to get together with X and the mutual friend mentioned it might be because she associates me with him. When she said that, it immediately made sense and I figured I’d give her some space. 

Weeks went by and I would get occasional snapchats from X, but I refrained from responding because frankly, I figured she didn’t want to see snaps of my life (my BF is her ex’s best friend and my BF and I live together and I didn’t want her to feel like anything was a reminder of her ex). 

She texted me a month or so after the breakup, saying “it’s been a while” and “it’s weird we haven’t talked since everything happened”. I told her my genuine response- how i thought she needed space from me after everything but how I’d love to see her and gave her Days that week I was free for dinner. She never responded. 

Growing up, I was always the bigger person maturity wise- if we got in a fight as elementary schoolers, I was always taught to be the first to extend an olive branch and forgive the other, even if I was right and they were in the wrong. X always has been an immature person, and I do feel I didn’t help her ever grow up since I always chalked up her behavior to immaturity. In our 20s, this continued; I was always going to see her (she lives in the city I work in, and while it’s super inconvenient to get to her house, I would always do it because “she doesn’t like to drive”). I think this situation, she expected me to continuously check up on her, when frankly, I was getting really busy in my own personal life, and didn’t have all the energy to dedicate to revolving around her life. 

We haven’t spoken in months; and frankly, I’m okay with it. If she reaches out, I won’t be mean or rude, but I would need to set boundaries if she ever wants to be friends again. I never set boundaries with her, and what it came down to was I was treating her like a best friend when in reality I was being a best friend to her and it wasn’t reciprocated. She was very manipulative and I fell victim to it-she would call me her best friend but couldn’t be bothered to meet me half way- literally and figuratively. 

Sorry for the long rant, but friendships change, and in my experience, letting things happen the way they do and being okay with it took me a while to accept. But if a friendship isn’t serving you, put your efforts into the relationships that do give you joy and the people who are there for you. I stayed in a friendship that wasn’t serving me purely because it was the longest friendship I had (and it seemed better than no friend), but once I realized it was very one sided, I realized I didnt need that"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,f48x1rg,t1_f47wkp9,1571451323.0,"Literally just sat in a meeting today where I’m the lead on a project yet all the males sat around talking and asking eachother questions that I was the only one who knew the answers to. I kept it together but when it kept going on and no one bothered to ask me, i interjected and answered their questions. It’s absolutely mind blowing how being a female basically means you might as well be a fly on the wall (in male dominated fields). It sucks because I’ve definitely built up my share of resentment over the years but I feel like speaking up has been a good way to “release” the resentment (but still need to be diplomatic and not snarky, of course)"

DoesAnybodyElse,f3zhe1t,t1_f3xl8mr,1571269095.0,"Totally agree. I always feel like if you enter the work space and others are there you greet them. I learned a couple years ago that not everyone thinks like that (coworkers who would literally walk right by you without saying good morning or hello or anything) and it still seems so uncomfortable to me. Weird as it sounds, I feel uncomfortable if I walk in somewhere and don’t say hello lol"

AskWomen,f3drh0y,t1_f3c277k,1570844890.0,Had a very similar situation-realizing it was a one-sided friendship took a long time but it feels liberating to no longer be doing work for a friendship that meant more to me than the other person

Goldendoodles,f2oizu9,t1_f2mpphf,1570329022.0,"We’re in kind of the same boat- but we had the X-ray done yesterday and the results showed nothing so the vet suggested an internal specialist and then seeing what they say. I asked about getting denamarin (the liver supplement) and she got us some so were gonna try that but I think I’m close to getting a second opinion because were a bit at a loss with the current vet not providing any other options first (the fact that I had to suggest denamarin versus her bringing that up as a first line). Especially considering she’s a 7 month old puppy (versus an older dog with a longer history). But initially I wasn’t thinking a second opinion was necessary but the longer this (seemingly rabbit hole-esque) situation goes on, the more I feel clueless and that a second opinion would be valuable"
Goldendoodles,f2e6tyx,t1_f2dioin,1570184089.0,Beginning of September was when her initial ALT came back elevated at 194 and we just had her retested October 1 and she was at 260. The vet suggested an X-ray since it’s rising and she’s not sure why. I’m wondering if I should suggest a bile test- so that’s not included on typical bloodwork panel?
Goldendoodles,f2ddvqt,t3_dazeff,1570151658.0,Not a vet but my golden has same thing-did you get any more tests done yet?
AskVet,f28iwr9,t1_f28ies5,1570062737.0,"Thanks for your response! It was more “we can reschedule the surgery if you’re worried until after we do more bloodwork”. But we went ahead with the spaying anyway. Basically, they suggested the xrays then moving to an internal specialist if the xrays didn’t show anything. We had situations before where when she was younger and all her baby teeth weren’t out they wanted us to have them pulled (they ended up falling out a couple days later), and so I was curious on how often a liver enzyme level might be elevated in a puppy and if it’s worth trying anything else or getting another opinion before we go down the route of xrays and possible biopsies."

femalefashionadvice,f176o5l,t1_f165dz4,1569237170.0,"It’s not OTC to my knowledge, but I got it easily from my dermatologist (I bet you can also probably get it from a regular primary care doctor). My brother also has the problem and got this stuff called Odaban (from England but I think he got it on amazon) and I think it worked pretty well for him too. But Drysol was great and it got to the point I could put it on only a couple times a week (but I still used regular antiperspirant daily bc I felt weird just putting drysol on at night and nothing during the day lol)"

HealthAnxiety,f0fm90f,t3_d4khsx,1568585651.0,"FWIW, one of the biggest things that helped me was when a doctor told me that if it was a major problem, it wouldn’t be better on some days and worse on others (it would just be bad all the time regardless). So when I’m having epic anxiety, I try to remember that."

puppy101,etso0rx,t3_cct5v3,1563150748.0,This was happening with my golden but I think it might’ve been because her teeth were falling out/lots of teething going on so her teeth were in pain and eating food was hard.
