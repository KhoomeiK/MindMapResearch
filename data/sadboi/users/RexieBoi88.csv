bipolar,fcw4aed,t3_ej4wpt,1578016815.0,From what I've seen dosage matters a lot with Seroquel. When I was first prescribed it she told me to try 50mg and if it didn't work go up to 100mg. That first day after taking it the night before I felt awful. Groggy. Sleeping off and on all day. There was no way I could function like that. So I took 100mg the next night and the next day I felt great! And ever since then I'm good. I get 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep. I feel great the next day. This is the most rested I've felt in years. So maybe discuss with your doctor if adjusting your dose will help with the daytime grogginess.
bipolar,fcw3pu3,t1_fcw3iyo,1578016441.0,I'm hoping. I called my psychiatrist this morning cause I had more outbursts and she took me off my 4th attemptes antidepressant treatment and put me on it. I can't wait to take it tomorrow. I'm really glad to hear it helped you. Having bipolar is.... exhausting.
bipolar,fcw326g,t3_ej7hcl,1578015999.0,I'm still trying to get stabilized there. Have tried 4 antidepressants and tomorrow I start Lithium. The anger is horrible. I try so hard but I'm still learning with therapy and trying with medication. I told my husband today he needs to reduce unloading stress stuff on me. He tends to dwell and dwell on stuff and all it does is build up in me until I explode and self-harm and scream. And it's awful. I'm so tired.

BipolarReddit,fcujfru,t3_ej067l,1577982377.0,I'd honestly find another psychiatrist. I know I plan on doing that if I go to mine soon and she doesn't switch my meds.
ftm,fcrsh7h,t3_eilhnp,1577906022.0,I wouldn't feel weird cause I love flowers! But that's me. Judging by how it made you feel I think you should let him know. It'd be a great way to start an open and communicative relationship. That's what I'd do in your situation. Don't abandon the date coming up because of your fears.
FTMMen,fcrqwjp,t3_eibjrz,1577905408.0,I was really excited about a lot of the changes but facial hair is something I dreaded. I never really wanted facial hair because i am a lazy guy and I don't want to have to maintain it(but I also dont want to be some neckbeard). The facial hair growth scared me at first. I had a baby stache only 2 months on T. It caused me issues to have it on there and it caused me issues to think about shaving it. So I stopped looking in the mirror for a while. Finally I got comfortable with it. I'm still meh about it. I HATE shaving but I still do it when things get too long for me. My hair growth isn't much and most of it is on my jawline and below it. Decent growth but not enough to cause me distress.
BipolarReddit,fcqjjop,t3_eii849,1577887127.0,Get stabilized. Lose weight. Stay in school.
bipolar,fcooa6c,t1_fcono1b,1577837240.0,"Thanks I hope they help too. Currently I am on Wellbutrin, Seroquel(for insomnia) and Trileptal. Besides the seroquel helping me get a full nights sleep I don't feel like anything else matters."
bipolar,fcocm61,t1_fcobtvr,1577828961.0,"Well my depression is damn near crippling. I lose interest in everything, including all my hoobies(I fucking LOVE gaming), and sex. I can't do anything. And I'm starting schooling again in a week and was hoping to be in control of it all so I will have the care and motivation to do the work. I'm really scared now.

Since Lithium is a proven medication to help I'm telling my psychiatrist I want to start it and Lamictal. These two both help with depression and mania. They have some rough side effects but at this point I dont care anymore. Anything is better than just existing."
bipolar,fcoato1,t3_ei8a0t,1577827721.0,"Diagnosed with depression, ptsd, social  anxiety and general anxiety last year at 30. Diagnosed with bipolar 1 in October this year at 31.

I suspected I was bipolar since I was a teen but I thought since my manic episodes are really close together(about 1 a month) I figured it was something else."
bipolar,fcmwyl6,t1_fcm7won,1577795982.0,"The hospital put me on mood stabilizers right away and that calmed me down. Unfortunately I keep having an ""episode"" with every antidepressant. So while the episodes I have are getting less frequent and lasting shorter, antidepressants really aren't doing their job yet. So I'm not even sure if you can call that stabilized yet."
