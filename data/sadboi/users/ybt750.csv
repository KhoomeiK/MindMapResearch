bipolar,f336qod,t3_df8bwn,1570632831.0,I’m currently taking depakote 1500mg with vraylar 1.5 and I can defiantly say the vraylar has helped keep any mania at bay it does take a few weeks to really start leveling out though. I would get a burst of energy from taking it at first so I would take it an hour or so before bed.
