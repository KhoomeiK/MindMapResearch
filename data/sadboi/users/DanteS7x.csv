depression,fdma0az,t1_fdm6hx0,1578543554.0,"Most of my family and city would probably look at my scars and think, “oh, he’s crazy/stay away from him” and I’m hoping for more people to look and think, “wow he’s probably been through a lot” like you, I, and other people that commented on my post. Thank you for your response."
depression,fdm5rfa,t1_fdm4kcz,1578540467.0,"Yea I get that. That makes sense. Ik it’s a lot to unpack for a stranger or someone I just met but my mental illness comes along with me, and if after meeting someone and getting to know them, and they aren’t comfortable with that still, then maybe I don’t wanna get to know them. I think that’s an important thing. If you have scars and you have to fake a persona and pretend to be this person who doesn’t have mental illness for EVERYONE, including friends, then maybe you’re with the wrong people if they can’t accept ALL of you. Thank you for your response."
depression,fdm3kd9,t1_fdm2zpr,1578538969.0,"That’s a really good way to view self-harm. I hope that something like that happens, helping someone else in my position gain the confidence to share their story, even when they think no one wants to hear/people will show disgust towards. I like the analogy that scars share a story that everyone should share. That’s what I’m afraid of, that no one will want to hear it or will be disgusted. Thank you very much."
depression,fdm34p9,t1_fdm2uq5,1578538681.0,"Thank you very much, I’m waiting for the world to be filled with people like you so I don’t have to worry about something like this. Most of my generation (GenZ) have this same mindset that you do. My family wouldn’t think the same way. I hope they go away somehow or I can get some sort of skin treatment to make them go away or something. Or everyone can just stop judging me and realize that I need help, and not criticism😄"
depression,fdm2shz,t1_fdm2ot3,1578538445.0,"I can understand, it makes sense for it to be something a person doesn’t wanna look at but I’ve been covering it up for way too long and I don’t want to anymore but also don’t wanna freak people out."
depression,f9umnvt,t1_f9um6tk,1575653891.0,"I’m not saying I for sure have it but it does make a lot of sense. Also if it’s hereditary, then that explains why my grandma is the same, she took a sleep study like 10 years ago and the doctors looked at her vitals and everything and found that she actually only needed like 5-6 hours of sleep and that may have been passed to me. Thank you, it still sucks cuz I love sleeping tho lol"

depression,f9u377b,t3_e6wilf,1575643546.0,"I love sleeping too but I’ve figured out that I only need to sleep like 5 hours and if I sleep any more, I’m tired all day (I know that doesn’t make any sense) so I can’t even sleep for a while and escape reality because I’d just be tired all day"
