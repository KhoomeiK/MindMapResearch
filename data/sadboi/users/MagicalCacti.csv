There is a ton of different formats Vintage, Commander, legacy, historic, Modern, Standard, pioneer, brawl the list goes on and on. The most competitive format is standard. Although there’s competition in every format. There is such decks that just want to play dragons and dragons and dragons. 

Modern is a competitive enough format that you could have some fun with that. Commander is where you can go nuts with dragons however it isn’t as competitive in my opinion and it’s more of a social game.

My opinion for you is to find what your friends play, then when you do that and maybe find a local lgs you see what they’re into. That way when you by your deck to wield your dragons you can do it and make sure it’s legal!

Ur-Dragon Commander deck is a fun one if you want to look at some dragons in the mean time. :)"

People who use it as an excuse to be horrible controlling parents, who manipulate and try to make people, especially there children to act like they will suffer if they don’t devotedly follow aren’t Christians.

On behalf of Christians who follow our Lord I’m so incredibly sorry if they hurt you, the Lord is the God of love, respect, and care. Those aren’t what I call Christians more fanatics if you can call it that.
