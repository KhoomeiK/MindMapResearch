florida,fqgk3uk,t1_fqeko6h,1589348404.0,"Not sure many people are aware, but one can very easily be baker acted based on an ex-parte file by a vindictive, sociopathic SO or family member even if you are as sane as the Pope (or whoever, mother Theresa, you get the point) law enforcement must take you in, especially since the Parkland shooting.  Happened to me by a family member who, should, herself be baker acted. Her allegations were, surprisingly, all projections of her own behavior, that could easily be corroborated as false. These were serious allegations, yet the judge didn’t question anyone other than the psychopath. Obviously I was released, but since  I was brought in mid afternoon, I still had to stay the evening and I still suffer nightmares. Furthermore, it’s perjury, but there is no consequences to the person who files, even when it can be proven the allegations as completely false. The baker act is bullshit, and I have absolutely no mental health issues, save for anxiety and worry, due to growing up with this disordered family member, who continues to destroy others lives. I see a therapist for this, but you’d never know if you met me, it’s not something that has impacted anyone else’s life, my job or safety. Baker act is bullshit and they 100% try to keep you if they see you have good insurance. My experience was shocking and my anxiety has exponentially increased since then. One would never think you can be pulled from your home (office actually) and have your freedom taken. Its unconscionable."

I’ve lived it, grew up with a psychotic sibling, who was enabled her entire life, and let me tell you the damage it can do. Particularly when they are able to terrorize their victims over and over again. You feel hopeless,  not to mention shocked, that the person gets away with so much, when they, in many instances,  are the ones who should be baker acted. The victims do need therapy, and I would recommend it, but be a little more sensitive to someone, when you don’t know the entire story. If you’ve never encountered a narcissistic sociopath, lucky you, and you wouldn’t understand, unless you’ve lived it."
