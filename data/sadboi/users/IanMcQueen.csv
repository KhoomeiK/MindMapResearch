I usually punt a rugby ball or football and pick it up to give me something else to do while sprinting, but I’ve lost a good 2-4 pounds doing this. Wait until after you’ve caught your breath in between each sprint, this will increase your speed more rather than conditioning. My logic behind this is that if you spend the same a lot of energy in a short period of time a bunch of times, you will burn more calories, assuming you do at least 30 sprints. The not eating part is so you’re using the fat in your body instead of the calories you eat, this might only work if you have a high metabolism though, I don’t know, I’m not educated in nutrition at all, this is just what I do.

Edit: I read that people are saying not to make them cut weight. I had to cut weight for little league football and I couldn’t stand it, but it was only once a year so I dealt with it. I couldn’t imagine cutting weight like that every single week as a 7 year old. I do it now but I also have the ability to know when my health is more important than being able to wrestle at a certain weight class. If someone told me they made their 7 year old cut anything more than a pound, I would yell at them and maybe even challenge them to a match. I really hope that this is a 1/100,000 kind of thing and not something people do to their kids."

SuicideWatch,eytvfzc,t3_cyfpuu,1567446590.0,"I know what you mean, I feel like it’s a mixture of the parents not knowing how to deal with the situation, then taking it as an insult to their parenting skills, them thinking that the kid is another person who fakes having the thoughts for attention/to get their way, and/or the concept of them wanting to commit suicide being so foreign to them that they can’t imagine what it’s like to have those thoughts. The last one is opposite for me, I’ve had these thoughts for so long that it’s normal to me, so when I tell someone that I have those thoughts and they react in a surprised way, it reminds me that not everybody has these thoughts and are likely not able to help someone who’s dealing with them. Luckily I’m not dealing with those thoughts right now, and I’m working on keeping it that way, but I take pride in the fact that I am able to deal with them and could potentially help someone who’s also going through them. When people would react angrily when I mentioned having these thoughts, particularly my parents early on, I would put that on myself and add it to my list of things I hated about myself, but later I learned to detach their reactions from myself as it wasn’t my fault that they didn’t know how to react and it spoke more to their lack of understanding than it did to me as a person. At the same time, it wasn’t their fault they didn’t know what it’s like to go through what I’m going through because it’s not something that they were familiar with. Once I thought about my parents’ reactions in that way, I was able to explain it better to them and help them realize that it wasn’t their fault that I had those thoughts, which made them less angry at me when I would bring it up. I’m lucky that my parents were able to accept that me having those thoughts wasn’t anybody’s fault as easily as they did, because it definitely helped me deal with the thoughts better and enabled me to get to where I am now. I don’t know you or your parents, but I hope this is able to help you with your struggles. I know you can pull through this and you’ll be stronger for it."

teenagers,evzjdi9,t3_cm2632,1564959128.0,"I think guns are cool, they’re loud and break things. The only thing I dislike about guns is that people use them to hurt others. A lot of the discussion surrounding guns, from both pro-gun people and anti-gun people, makes me upset because it seems like too many people from both sides are trying to push an agenda rather than solve the problem. It’s difficult for me to figure out what is true, false, true but mis-leading, or whatever and that prevents me from definitively choosing a side. The way I interpret the second amendment’s intended purpose is that it is supposed to secure the people’s ability to revolt against the government if it is necessary, and that is a very important right for us to have in my opinion. The question I struggle with is whether or not the amount of lives banning guns could potentially save is more important than the risk of a tyrannical government rising up after the people’s access to guns have been removed. If banning guns meant that the non-suicide gun deaths in the US would drop to zero and half of the gun-suicide deaths would live, I would side with the lives saved over the risk of tyranny. However, I don’t think a total gun ban would be as beneficial as that. A total gun ban would most likely reduce the amount of mass shootings, but the death count of mass shootings committed by guns obtained illegally would probably be higher on average than the ones that occur now. I think that individual states should be able to hold votes to decide on if they want to ban all guns, so if 60% of the residents of Nevada want to ban all guns then they can vote for that to happen. On the other hand, if the Alaskan residents vote in favor of guns then they would be able to keep them. I don’t think I am knowledgable enough on all the ramifications of this issue, and I might change my mind later if I learn something new, but this is how I feel based on what I currently know/think.

TLDR: Guns are cool. People aren’t as cool. States should be able to decide whether or not people are cool enough for guns."

The time dependency is part of what makes them money, less time to realize you don’t need something means you are more likely to buy it.

Madden Mobile isn’t a trading card game, never has been and never will be. Adding a trading system to the game would be cool but way too easy to exploit. There is no convenient way to monitor alternative accounts without restricting accounts based on IP’s or cellular plans. Anything they would do to stop alt accounts would hurt more innocent players than exploiters.

EA wouldn’t do something that would make their game easier to exploit or net them less profit.

But, like I said, if trading is allowed then less people would need to buy the card they want because they could trade for it. If your argument is that it would be an insignificant difference, then that is speculation and is hard to have a definitive answer. Look at the TOTY for example, someone buys one and then later gets a new card that replaces it, if someone else wants that card they’d would have to buy it. If trading is allowed, they could trade for it, meaning EA has only one sale between two people.
