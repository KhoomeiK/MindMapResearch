Do you have any recommendations about different manifesting perspectives/something that you have been exploring lately, I would love to hear any recommendations!!

I read a book recently, ""But What If We're Wrong"", it talks about how how some beliefs we have held for centuries, one day completely turned and were proven to be true/false.

Which side do you kill? Of course most people would say that you would kill the strangers, but is that really fair to them?

Also as a person with anxiety I find myself victim blaming a lot, everytime I have a negative thought I instantly feel invalid and like nothing will come true. I truly think that the bad sides like you mentioned in this response should be brought more attention when learning/teaching about LOA.

Going off based on your last point, LOA leaves a lot of grey space. Bad thoughts = bad things, good thoughts = good things. But what's bad and good? I would like to argue that bad and good don't even exist. What about psychopaths? Something that is good for them may be horrible for a neurotypical person.

If anything, the life path which you want to pursue (getting married and having kids) is quite romantic and fits the aesthetic perfectly! Coffee dates, writing each other poems and love letters, etc.

I mean think of this, if you give an encyclopedia to two different kids, one would probably find the book extremely amusing while the other one may think it's boring and a waste of time. But just like with anything else in life, you can learn things, and you can learn how to have that thirst for knowledge. 

I used to be extremely stubborn. If I didn't know something or a definition of a word I would just say screw it and move along with my day. But then I stopped doing that by simply googling anything that slightly intrigued me. Whether it be a word I heard of, a random fact about penguins (idk), what's the weather like in a place I don't live etc. If anything even slightly intrigues you, why not pursue it?

I can completely agree with the whole learning about the brain thing (I'm not a psych major, I just took kinesiology in hs and read a lot of psychology books) and it's crazy coming to the realization that our entire lives are being controlled by a wet slab of meat... even our perception is manipulated by our brain!!

For example people back in the day thought that they knew everything there was about gravity, but in fact they didn't even know 20%.

philosophy,fjh6p2u,t3_fcgzim,1583342292.0,"DID & Tabula Rasa?

Dissociative Identity Disorder is a mental disorder where a person has ""multiple personalities"" due to horrible childhood trauma and a bad attachment to primary caregiver(s). Some persons with DID have been recorded and witnessed to do things in an altered state (different personality) that they could not do normally and alone. The most prominent example is that of a person speaking a language they have never studied or learned.

[a forum discussing the topic of speaking other languages](https://www.psychforums.com/dissociative-identity/topic54852.html)

What would John Locke say about this? Yes we throughout our lives pick up on many different languages, but I doubt we pick up and retain enough to just speak it almost fluently, let alone small sentences. If our minds are a blank slate, how can persons with DID know these languages and speak them? 
*I'm really not taking any side in this, I just became intrigued and would like some opinions :)"
unpopularopinion,fjeuwb8,t1_fjetc38,1583278665.0,yeah totally agree with you. it really sucks and it's so easy to cheat the system but oh well. to be honest I can't even think of a replacement to the standardized testings lol
unpopularopinion,fjesim6,t1_fjes917,1583277425.0,"yeah but preparing for a test just means make cheat sheets and memorize the textbook, no one actually sits down and learns the concept (sorry for the generalization, but nobody who I know learns the concept) :/"
unpopularopinion,fjerhwk,t3_fd33yf,1583276888.0,"I agree but also don't at the same time. Yes standardized testing is very great to compare school to school, but it doesn't show true intelligence. For example I get good grades and so does my school but all we do is cheat and just memorize the textbook and instantly forget about it. I am not complaining though, I'm totally ok with that, but I wish there were better tests that actively test your knowledge. Idk overall, I relate with your original statement :)"
DarkAcademia,fje776o,t1_fjdrtbb,1583266527.0,I agree! I just started reading it and I've never been so captured and intrigued by a book before:)

OCD,fjbdbjz,t3_fchhme,1583190845.0,it's so crazy looking back and realizing that starting from the age of 6 when I would wash dishes I would have those thoughts..... haha...Â¿
DarkAcademia,fjbd0gs,t1_fjbc8du,1583190679.0,your dad sounds like a great man with a great taste haha!
DarkAcademia,fjbcw0m,t3_fcji87,1583190614.0,"as another used said thrifting is so great, there's a website called ""thredup"" and it's basically an online thrift store. you can find very good ""designer"" items on there for so so cheap as the website has a lot of sales. also maybe look into depop? it's an app, also basically a thrift store but you buy from other people :) sometimes you can find great pieces as well bargain for a price you want!!"
DarkAcademia,fjbc0gi,t1_fjbb9xr,1583190148.0,that sounds lovely! I recall walking by a tiny Persian tea store in town and it was so fragrant you can smell it from the outside :)
DarkAcademia,fjbbow9,t1_fjb6gzk,1583189979.0,"all of our creamers here suck (at least the one I have tried) but I drink a lot of hazelnut cappuccino so I get the whole ~hazelnut~ thing, it's really really good!! :)

condensed milk is super popular in my culture, we even eat it by itself as a dessert haha 

and mocha is fantastic also, you have a very excellent taste!!"
DarkAcademia,fjbbfd4,t1_fjb2gn7,1583189842.0,"I love Tazo's packaging, it's very beautiful! I'll definitely check it out in store. thanks for the comment!!"

DarkAcademia,fjan9gb,t1_fjaf1yk,1583176829.0,I love breakfast tea in the morning (obviously). I believe some types also have more caffeine than actual coffee so that's a plus :)
DarkAcademia,fjan4s6,t1_fjagdyx,1583176756.0,tbh a good iced caramel macchiato with a pair of books in the library would look very aesthetic lol
