powerwashingporn,fpj612u,t3_gdohov,1588657629.0,I love how they went square by square. Perfect execution
depression,foho0up,t3_g76n13,1587769286.0,I used to feel that way. And then my dad died and yeah it was nice in the moment that teachers actually tolerated my excuses and understood why I just didn't go to class some days but now it's a year later and I have more pain than I started with. It's not worth the 1 month grace period.
AmItheAsshole,fo6a0we,t3_g5rgqt,1587552142.0,"YTA. I could tell from the title. How uncompassionate of you. She clearly told you that she was stressed. What if she is an essential worker taking on more hours? What if a family member caught the virus? What if her home situation isn't alright? Even though you already reached out to her, I could completely see her not wanting to communicate about life's problems with a random professor. Maybe she still believed she could actuality do it too. Be a human and stop throwing people under the bus. You said it was a handout class, she is probably trying her hardest and took that class because she needs something easy in her life right now."

YangForPresidentHQ,ff874ll,t3_es67jp,1579667892.0,I got the facebook group on the same page! Making sure nobody donates but just earns points.
YangForPresidentHQ,ff85md1,t1_ff84b2c,1579666642.0,"I am totally okay with being blunt. I want to help the campaign in any way possible which is why I shared it originally. 

I just double checked the ""About"" section in the app and it says that only the proceeds from the jar will be donated. I will update the post. It doesn't make sense to donate to this app which might be given to another candidate when we could directly give it to Yang, but maybe we can still win the money that other people are putting in?"
YangForPresidentHQ,ff83qv8,t1_ff83hhk,1579665192.0,I can delete the post if that is the case... I truly thought that this would help. I would feel terrible for misleading people. Can you just link me to where you learned that?
YangForPresidentHQ,ff4zmlu,t1_ff4ysko,1579576310.0,Thank you! I will give it a shot tomorrow because I really want to help! #yanggang
YangForPresidentHQ,ff4p8gt,t1_ff4p07n,1579569132.0,Thank you! I will for sure look further into it then. I really hope Yang wins!
PCOS,fd4nqar,t1_fd2v661,1578169238.0,"Thanks! I want keto for weight loss at the moment, but once I get to my goal weight I wanted to transition to a paleo with complex carbs in moderation. I definitely think trying the cyclical diet will help me stay on it. I will for sure check out that podcast!!"
PCOS,fd2gr7z,t1_fd25ns2,1578146987.0,"Thank you! The first time around I didn't have any cheat days on keto and I got my period, but now I'm on birth control so I am less worried about that part. I'm hoping that the carb day helps me stay on the diet but it might also allow cravings. I guess I will just have to try for myself."
confession,fbc30lq,t3_ecdabx,1576714423.0,"I once got a parking ticket at my college even though I had a pass. Theree were no spots that I was allowed to take and I was about to be late, so I parked in a ""premium"" spot and risked it. They gave me a $50 parking ticket that came in an envelope, and now every time I have to park in a premium spot I put the envelope on my windshield."
Keto_Food,ey7ov8z,t3_cvwbks,1566893111.0,"If anyone is wondering what kind of low carb options are at BWW (from a server that has done keto) -

Naked tenders - really good with one of the dry seasonings added to them. Order with a side of coleslaw or a veggie boat (carrot/celery)

Traditional wings - order them plain and get one of the lower in carbs dipping sauces. You can order all drums, all flats, or extra crispy. 

Parm garlic and any buffalo sauce there - 1 carb/Tbsp 
Don't get any sugary sauces like BBQ, Teryaki, Jammin Jalepeno, Mango Habanero, or Asian Zing. These all have upwards of 5 - 10 carbs/Tbsp. 

Dry seasonings are also great on the wings. 

Any salad there without croutons or tortillas. We have vinaigrettes to choose from. 

Any side like fries could be replaced with coleslaw or a veggie boat."
