AskAnthropology,fdd8zvc,t3_ekih3d,1578300363.0,"I‚Äôm not an expert by any means, but one of my professional and personal interests is Paraguay, and in turn Guaran√≠ culture. Luis√µ/Luison is one of the cursed children of Tau and Kerana. With the introduction of European folklore, Luis√µ slowly gained elements of a werewolf: being bitten turns you into a creature like him, a wolf-like appearance, hunting during the full moon. Originally, Luis√µ was more humanoid (though very disgusting in appearance and odor) and mostly kept to burial grounds where he ate the dead. If he walked between your legs, you could then turn into a creature like him (which may have some European influence). Even his modern name is contentious as it likely is a replacement (Lobison is a less popular variant, but shows a connection to the Spanish lobo, meaning wolf). I know less about another figure, Mala Visi√≥n (bad/evil vision), but the name itself is Spanish and not Guaran√≠, so that alone shows influence.

EDIT: I should mention that most of what we know about Guaran√≠ mythology and culture comes from missionaries and modern customs that are already influenced by European colonialism (and Paraguay‚Äôs history of isolationism and forced interracial marriages to create a national identity). I spend summers there on a fellowship learning the indigenous language, and while there are obvious additions (ovecha meaning sheep, which is oveja in Spanish), there are some that a bit insidious. For example, jasypa means month, but this is likely a formation from colonialism as jasy means moon, just as month (Spanish mes) comes from moon. We‚Äôll likely never know how deeply colonialism has changed and modified Guaran√≠ culture in Paraguay."
television,fdd78pl,t3_eht2zp,1578297913.0,"Like some of the people here, I really loved episodes 1 and 2. Dracula and Agatha‚Äôs cat-and-mouse was really entertaining, and I honestly didn‚Äôt see some twists coming; the extra nice thing is that many of the twists didn‚Äôt feel shoehorned or pointless!

However, the moment we were taken into modernity...I just knew I was going to hate it. I understand the desire to recontextualize classics into the modern day, but for some reason I am just personally so bored of age-old beings having to navigate our time period. The jokes/gags are usually shit and unoriginal.

I wanted Agatha and Dracula to have a better final battle of wits. Having her (sort of?) possess an indirect descendant felt so...incomplete. Honestly, the story would‚Äôve been much better had it just been a long movie on Netflix rather than the awkward length it currently is.

Please. No Season 2. Agatha was the absolute best part of this show.

AskReddit,ep8iewb,t1_ep8ep2d,1559095366.0,"I suppose this is partially my fault for not being clearer. I‚Äôm a composition instructor and I teach MLA style. I also grade based on MLA standards in the classroom. You and I are teaching students to communicate in one particular style of written English. That‚Äôs a whole other area of discussion. We‚Äôre not telling them that this is the only way to communicate or cite sources. It‚Äôs just one generally accepted way within a community. 

When I say arbitrary rules, I‚Äôm not referring to sentence structure and verb conjugation that developed naturally as English speakers used the language. I‚Äôm talking about grammar rules that English grammarians historically implemented (don‚Äôt split infinitives, don‚Äôt end on propositions, etc.). Latin was the language of scholars when English grammarians began codifying what they thought was proper. Mind you, English was greatly the language of laypeople during many parts of English history, with the Normans using French in the courts and the Church using Latin. (This is also why English has taken on so much from Latin and French. Some argue that modern English is an interlanguage or creole language due to the amount of influence those Romance languages had on English, a Germanic language.) With no real historical texts regarding English to guide them, grammarians took Latin language rules and applied them to English. Here‚Äôs an example of how it is arbitrary:
- You‚Äôre the person I‚Äôm speaking to.
- You‚Äôre the person to whom I‚Äôm speaking.

One follows traditional rules of English grammar as established by grammarians who studied Latin. The other does not. However, the meaning is not lost in either; they both mean the same thing. One is more ‚Äúacademic‚Äù or ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù sounding, and the other is what you hear on a day-to-day basis.

Another example of this can be found with splitting infinitives. Infinitives in English are composed of ‚Äúto‚Äù and the root verb (e.g. to run, to walk, to speak). In Latin, you cannot split an infinitive because it is a single word, much like verbs in Spanish‚Äîa language derived from Latin (e.g. correr, caminar, hablar). To split these Latin infinitives would mean breaking the words apart; this is not an issue with English infinitives.
- She told me not to run with scissors.
- She told me to not run with scissors.

Both make sense. Both can be heard in everyday English conversations. In the end, the distinctions here are, indeed, arbitrary. I‚Äôm not saying APA and MLA don‚Äôt serve their purposes. They help us unify communities around large bodies of writing that can be understood once the method is learned. However, just because contractions are frowned upon in one style of English doesn‚Äôt make them wrong altogether. There are rules governing MLA. There are rules governing AAVE. One has rules written down, rules that were consciously determined by a group of people. Another set of rules were developed organically through speakers‚Äô linguistic needs and cultural backgrounds. 

Sorry to make this a really long post. I just want to be clear. This is a very complex topic.

Also, your example: ‚ÄúI are going to the store.‚Äù While the subject and verb disagree here, we can contextually figure out what the speaker is saying even if it hits our ears wrong. The pronoun makes it clear‚Äîgiven general English usage across variations‚Äîthat the speaker is referring to an action that they themselves completed. However, since this is likely an issue rooted in conjugation‚Äîand not rooted in the speaker speaking a variation of English‚Äîit‚Äôs not a good example to counter my point. I‚Äôm discussing ‚Äúerrors‚Äù that people point out regularly that really aren‚Äôt errors.
- Rural American English: ‚ÄúI seen you yesterday.‚Äù Though the speaker is using the past participle of ‚Äúto see,‚Äù we know‚Äîthanks to context‚Äîthat the speaker is referring to an event that happened yesterday. Yes, ‚ÄúStandard American English‚Äù prefers ‚ÄúI saw you yesterday.‚Äù However, nothing is lost. The meaning is relayed.
- AAVE: ‚ÄúShe out runnin‚Äô errands.‚Äù Although the verb ‚Äúis‚Äù is omitted, the use of the present progressive -ing (itself modified to delete the ‚Äúg‚Äù) is an indicator that the subject is performing an action that is present progressive. Again, the context makes it clear. It means the same thing as ‚ÄúShe is out running errands.‚Äù 

I really wish people would stop coming here and just calling it bullshit. I understand that I summarized a very complex subject, but...God. It‚Äôs just proving the point if the thread. I‚Äôve studied this. I‚Äôve researched this. This is my job. Rather than call it bullshit, ask for clarification, like I did when I was first learning about this."

TLDR;
Your ‚ÄúGrammar Nazi‚Äù friend isn‚Äôt using the term ‚Äúgrammar‚Äù correctly and is just being a dick. 

P.S. Professors of history, political science, etc. are the worst about enforcing arbitrary rules and thinking they know what ‚Äúgood‚Äù writing is. The rules they worship were arbitrarily lifted from Latin by English grammarians.
