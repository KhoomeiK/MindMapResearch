I'm really sorry... you're not alone, my mom is living paycheck to paycheck. My dad sometimes helps, but rarely. I've been to my friends' places and all my friends have nice stuff and live comfortably and never have to worry about having food on the table. Meanwhile, I live in an apartment with 6 other of my family members and we're just barely getting by.

That's just the way shit works, I guess. It sucks. And we just gotta power through.

He got married to his ex-wife in the Mormon church. He managed to escape from the Mormon church, but his wife kept his children. His family is still affiliated with them and he's pretty much alone. The Mormon church is just shitty. You can research it yourself. He wants to save his kids from the Mormon church, but alas, the child support system seems to be on the woman's side all the time.

These people telling you to phone CPS immediately don't really understand that the government is not on your side, they're going to use force and possibly ruin your life more than needed.

Do you have a school counselor? Have the school counselor talk to your mom about it and explain how mean she's being. Get your mom nervous for treating you this way, but don't call CPS straight away. 

By being nice, she might be manipulating and guilt tripping you, so you may want to talk to your school counselor about that possibility as well.
