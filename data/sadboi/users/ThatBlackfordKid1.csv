WildernessBackpacking,fqm4gyz,t1_fqm08cy,1589471348.0,What would your opinion be on a bear bell? Or do you think talking to your partner would suffice to deter the average bear?

AskReddit,fprhy3f,t3_gexhgi,1588854605.0,"I had gotten off early from work at my old job on 3rds and was driving home on the highway. This road was completely empty at this time being it was about 330am. I notice in my head lights reflectors and I watch this man try to jump the small median in his bike and cross this double lane highway. He falls and I stop my car and I realize I know this guy, he’s a friend of a friend (call him Brian). So I stop the car and get Brian up and moving and he’s really distraught and depressed. I knew from Facebook that him and his fiancée had split a week or so ago. He told me that’s why he was out riding his bike in the road, Hoping he might get hit. Well I put him in my car and strap his bike to the top of my Jeep (98 Jeep Cherokee) and I take him home. His family had been looking for him and day and night and were so relieved. He messaged me later that week and thanked me. He said if I hadn’t shown up he was gonna lay there till someone ran him over or the cops came. I’ve never felt like I saved his life only that I helped someone who needed my help."

I recently started to get into golf a lot and I’m sure I’d love it as much then as I do now. I’d do better in school and try harder so that I could get into nursing school easier and not have to take refresher courses and all. I’d get to the top of my class instead of hanging out with the people I did who didn’t care about school or doing well.
  

  Edit: I’d also spend more time with the people I love and get away from my narcissistic mother sooner."
