Drugs,etjhzos,t1_etj89hq,1562874007.0,"I had a verrrry bad experience with weed about a year ago. I smoked WAY too much and was with some sketchy people. I got so fucked up, that time actually started repeating. I was trapped in my mind. It might have been laced weed, but I'm not sure. Either way, I was hallucinating a lot, and constantly repeating moments. It was a nightmare.

I think that's what triggered my depersonalization this time. I got scared that it would happen again, and just embraced the moment, and that's when I felt how I felt. I really hope this isn't a reoccurring problem for me. So far, I've been fine, but ever since that experience,  I find myself feeling off at times."

Back when I was having an episode of major depression, where I dropped out of school and isolated myself for 5 months, they would call me everyday to try to get me out of my room. And even though I never answered, they just kept calling. I know I'm just overthinking and obsessing, but it's so hard not to. But honestly, thank you for your comment. I'm gonna try not to think about it so much"
bipolar,eppe2q4,t1_epp77mw,1559375696.0,"At first I thought I was completely losing my mind, but after I calmed down for a bit, I kinda figured it was just a panic attack. I still can't explain why I heard the radio going double the speed, but maybe my time perception was just messed up.

I actually saw my psychiatrist yesterday, and she upped my Zoloft, which I don't think was a very good idea. Maybe I should find a new psychiatrist, cuz this one isnt really helping me feel more stable

Thanks for your response, I really appreciate it"
