I cross stitch and crochet as a crafting hobby (literally taught myself how to crochet via youtube videos) so there's those you could do maybe? :) I guess it depends on what you have interest in, to make or create liek as in baking or grow as in gardening or soaps, candles, bath bombs... all the things! So much to make and do and so little time eh?
