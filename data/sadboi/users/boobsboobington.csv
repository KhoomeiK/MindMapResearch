MAFS_AU,fk7ck54,t1_fk6vc19,1583933490.0,Omg. My boyfriend does all of these to help me/us 😂 I used to pretend I did not relate to my star sign at ALL but that in itself was such a Virgo thing to do.
mentalhealth,fk5ez3a,t1_fh8d6wv,1583879137.0,"I feel really lost when I read these things. I don’t feel sorry for myself or see myself as a victim of any of the things that happen. I just genuinely feel so lost every day waiting to feel differently, and the trying for so long to put on this face chips away at me more because it’s changing nothing on the inside."

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjoynd5,t1_fjo6qvt,1583537667.0,"I was TOTALLY on board & had that point of view before the reunion- but seeing how he was kind, didn’t throw her under the bus or say anything negative it kind of changed for me. especially as the ‘nice guy’ usually flips and turns evil once their rejected. But he didn’t do that & I was so surprised. He was so invested in the show & she was saying a lot to him about being in love with him & his persistence was a lot, but in the context of the show they had to try hard & they were there to make it work. He also was given a lot of mixed messages. I dunno at this point I just think a more manipulative person could have played that reunion more to their strength by speaking about how he was hurt or felt embarrassed or treated like a second choice but instead he didn’t. to me that shows that he understood she wasn’t into him & he accepted it instead of feeling owed a woman’s love or adoration."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjoyjxq,t1_fjoqsoi,1583537603.0,I didn’t know about the extra stuff about agreeing to say no & bringing the family members etc! That’s all very odd & nasty if he did that.

femalefashionadvice,fjnwr3d,t1_fjnjr94,1583515866.0,Pleasure! & glad you understood w h my spelling mistakes (that understand was meant to be understate haha!)
femalefashionadvice,fjn5yla,t3_fe3471,1583498974.0,I definitely think a cute grouping of clips can still look very in fashion & not unprofessional or try hardy! Try & go for some gold slides or even a tortoise coloured clip to understand it but still add some pizazz
rupaulsdragrace,fjcsd5u,t1_fj8iys0,1583234739.0,"These feelings don’t speak to your levels of maturity ! You aren’t in control of your emotions if they keep you up, it’s a horrible extra level of self sabotage to critique how you are feeling ! I do it to but just saying don’t blame this behaviour on yourself, instead think about why it’s impacting you & give yourself a break xx"
MAFS_AU,fjcm820,t1_fjck3br,1583226268.0,"Yes absolutely! Manipulating situations here, to exploit this ‘earned’ loyalty. It’s such a common high school move, that I see in adult friendships on another kind of level!!"
MAFS_AU,fjcjzry,t1_fjbt2qf,1583223313.0,"I think he thought he had won her over, or had her in his corner because its the angle he uses on people. In his mind “I stook up for Mishel when her husband was rude to her” and I took her from his side to my side & I get that back later in return. He seemed shocked that she still sees through him."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj8d9xh,t1_fj2u4bv,1583110708.0,MINE TOO! I need to watch again!
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj26cgp,t1_fj1llp7,1582935655.0,Agreeeeeed!
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fiyn2xt,t3_fa9rkt,1582842670.0,"Charo vibes & also, the character from Thumbelina (who I’m pretty sure was also based on Charo!!!)"
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fiymw4f,t3_fa9wky,1582842564.0,Agree! They tried to make him scary but he came off as a strong no bullshit man who needed to feel comfortable about the man his daughter fell for in the circumstances. He supported them & stood up at the wedding to say so!
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fiymqin,t3_fa9rkt,1582842471.0,I got that even before she came on screen! No idea how raising a man to respect women & love their strength could have been a turn off. She did well & you could tell she saw through her but supported her son & treated her with kindness & open arms anyway. She the real MVP!
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fiym9xs,t1_fiy9whn,1582842209.0,Hands down. She was connected on some holy magic level like you could tell her intuition called bullshit straight away. When she goes ‘you wanna run away’ right before he walked down the aisle !
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fiwq2pv,t3_fa9qy1,1582797556.0,"I thought exactly the same, that it was to save the traditions for her real wedding.
How much did she lead him on walking in and talking to him?!!???"
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fiwpv9l,t3_fa9olt,1582797247.0,I’m almost 100% sure they are actors after the wedding! that entire thing was a real life high school drama play!
AskMen,fi2jz24,t1_fi1iuay,1582081531.0,"I think being a gentle person tells us you’re not ugly. People that know you get to see that and deserve it. The people who judge you if they are are either like most of the people on this thread who are thinking more about themselves than judging you, or they are assholes ! Xx"
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fi21zdy,t3_f5r5xr,1582069647.0,"The show is all about prioritising emotional connection over superficial preferences that everyone has! Even if she usually dated different types of men, she said that she fell in love with this man. She also was ready to dump him with Barnett’s approval before they met anyway. Sexual attraction is SOOOO important but she’s choosing not to admit that she’s not attracted to him while stringing him along to remain on the show. Not one of her actions seem to be in order to protect him from being hurt, because I don’t even think she thinks that way. I think she believes she is coming off really sweet & well. If this is an experiment on whether love is blind, she’s basically the one contestant that let those standards get in the way. 
Diamond left because she felt disrespected with how she was spoken to & treated during the conversation (or she may have been bigoted/couldn’t have seen herself with bi man, i can’t assume what I think in that situation). It was all this messy incompatibility with how they approached situations & how they both felt at that road.
With Jessica & Mark on the other hand, if it doesn’t work it’s solely because it was never going to & there’s one person battling for a relationship & one person there for themselves! that’s just nasty! She just said I can’t wear the ring TO THE POOL because I’m not feeling it, oh I can’t meet your family it seems wrong, but almost wants him to fight for her affection & feeds him little bits of hope at a time.... like just suddenly being like ‘yes okay sure we’re good let’s go home together’ when she’s at a point where it’s clear she’s not into him.

Wow how did I get so invested in this?!?!"
TheMorningShow,fi09jqc,t3_f57l9o,1582031080.0,"I found his version of love incredibly selfish, & I don’t think it was different with his wife. He didn’t look heartbroken when she left but more angry than anything that she’d leave him in that state. When he walked into the studio & professed his love to the crew it still felt incredibly one sided & as if they owed it to him. He is the epitome of the entitled ego I can sadly see creep out in even the ‘good’ men when theyre challenged or lose something that felt they deserved. When he hit on alex in the car as if it was ‘their time’ to be together. He is so expecting of love and even being so hated couldn’t shake that entitlement. So I don’t think someone wants to change for someone they take for granted & I believe his wife would have been #1 on that list."
TheMorningShow,fi090dc,t1_fbfwy7v,1582030607.0,"I can’t believe how until he revealed it I wasn’t even interested in the leak, I assumed it was a random, unnamed person & never invested in knowing?!"

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fi07hzg,t1_fhqao1e,1582029216.0,Absolutely! It was clear that his way of protecting himself is by making a situation uncomfortable by being nasty or overly sexually assertive (like the weird convo with the daddy hat that just made her uncomfortable) because he was obviously just nervous and already defensive of himself. He must have so much ingrained homophobia it’s horrible- because he really tries to compensate with general sexist or rude attitude as he clearly thinks that’s okay behaviour between a man to ‘his’ woman.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fi07avk,t1_fhqhnme,1582029022.0,How didnt he smell a rat when she got SO drunk and they had that fight the night that they all reunited on the beach?!!?! She was so obviously sad drunk rejected girl & could not stop looking at Barnett and playing it all up.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fi0745y,t1_fhqp4jb,1582028841.0,"Remember when she goes to Barnett ‘what do you need me to do I’ll do it’ kinda like saying I’ll break marks heart I don’t care, that irked me ! She is using mark so hard it’s so gross."
