weddingplanning,fr1odbq,t1_fqxns9v,1589823201.0,I postponed mine from April to October and now I have to postpone again Andi feel the same about vendors all complying. I've been holding off on making the call cuz I'm a healthcare worker and I'm DRAINED and mentally not ready to fight the venue if they deny me to give me most of my money back
weddingplanning,fqgiuuw,t1_fqgf28x,1589347431.0,"I m pretty much REALLY similar situation. Moved from April to October. Venue took over THOUSANDS of dollars for deposit all the deposits paid to vendors and it's heart wrenching to me right now that I won't be able to have my 300 person wedding. Actually I already know il have to reschedule again but I mentally can't go through calling the venue and dealing with this right now. I'm terrified they're gonna go out if business and IL lose everything. On top of that I'm a healthcare worker so I'm still working full time and haven't had the chance to just sit quietly and freaking think. I was crying on my drive home bc I feel so overwhelmed and I feel guilty for being sad bc people are dieing and my friends all they say is ""don't worry it'll be fine"" it's not the realistic answer and I'm just sad sorry for the rant."
wedding,fq8tskx,t1_fq83ui9,1589175317.0,This is me I rescheduled from my April wedding to October and now have to consider changing it again ahh
wedding,fpx5chy,t1_fpx1ot3,1588975959.0,Ugh I feel this pain. Esp when those small armies of kids are crazy and run around the whole time. If they were well behaved I wouldn't mind but I've first hand seen their destruction. And I notice parents don't discpline their kids during events they're too busy taking pictures and watch their kids interrupt dances and stuff like that with a smile on their face. Grrr
wedding,fpx5215,t3_gfuk00,1588975798.0,"I tried the no kids thing for my (now postponed wedding) and so much drama broke loose. I'm not close to relatives infact we haven't spoken in over a decade but recently reconciled last summer. And in that time they had so many kids I didn't even know about so I didn't feel like they should have a place for their wild kids at my wedding. Well I lost the battle, my parents were supportive of me but I personally felt so bad with the angst and backlash they dealt with so I caved in"

AskMen,fkt7xun,t1_fkr6ztr,1584509058.0,This hits home. And it sucks when u owe over six figures of student debt looming over you. Work literally consumes all aspects of my life. I can't wait one day to feel that weight off
weddingplanning,fknd8bf,t1_fkncksu,1584362557.0,I personally don't think it's necessary. U fulfilled the formality part of sending out formal invites. In this digital age physical invites dont even seen necessary but a phone call could be enough for those with no access to WiFi. If it's a lot of people without internet access then consider it but if it's just a few idk if it's worth the trouble. I'm in the same boat with decision making and it's overwhelming to have to be responsible for something so big/expensive. I just don't care for these other things now. Good luck im waiting on a call back from the venue to formally update ours. You can do this!
weddingplanning,fknbbv3,t1_fknar45,1584360851.0,I spent a lot of time on my invites so I refuse to redo them. My wedding website is on the physical invite so io be mass texting an updated save the date picture along with a message regarding Corona and also stating to find the updated information on the wedding website and RSVP from there. And ur doing the right thing. Stand your ground. if something happened to ur family they wudnt be responsible so it's so easy for them to say that
weddingplanning,fknajys,t3_fjf0tc,1584360101.0,So freaking amazing! I was told by family I shud just cancel and save money for a house 😳 sigh
weddingplanning,fknae4d,t3_fjituc,1584359942.0,NYC traffic no joke. I was born and raised here and I wud strongly advocate for a Sunday wedding. I was in the same dilemma and opted for Sunday and honestly the people u love are gonna stay with u. Ive had friends tell me with 2 hour one way commutes to Manhatten that they're gonna stay till before midnight. It might not be realistic for everyone but I'd rather everyone come in time and not rushed and enjoy the events and leave by free style dancing time which is the last thing on our agenda. I definitely decided against Friday mostly bc of work rush and traffic. And people having to rush to get ready wud stress me out for someone else's wedding.
weddingplanning,fkn9jjr,t1_fkmdru6,1584359082.0,2 people from my wedding party already cancelled on me for 04/18. I was annoyed but I understand and it's not their fault and it helped pushed me to decide to change the date. I hope ur bride will become understanding this is a completely unique and unprecedented situation for many of us so I feel like it will take a second for people to understand what's really going on
weddingplanning,fkn9f7t,t1_fkmdtnv,1584358957.0,Im in healthcare too and so tired with dealing with the hospital and hearing about Corona and everyone asking about the status of the wedding.
weddingplanning,fkn9a9w,t1_fkmovp5,1584358812.0,One of my vendors refused to return our deposit on a tentative date but the venue has been really good. We will be confirming the change. Good luck and I completely understand how crazy this all is
weddingplanning,fkn96bm,t1_fkme1gz,1584358694.0,04/18 chiming in here too and I have produced a similar text with an updated save the date to mass text! We're doing what's best for everyone even tho it sucks it'll be worth it. I hope u still have the wedding of ur dreams!
weddingplanning,fkn8gxb,t1_fkmi0vy,1584357923.0,I'm so sorry. In in the same boat for 4/18 wedding. We are gonna be confirming with the venue today about the date change and I already have a updated save the picture ready to mass text. I already have one vendor confirm they won't be available and won't be returning the deposit (is that even fair???). Sigh. I hope it won't be as bad today. Sending u prayers and hugs and lots of luck.
weddingplanning,fkn8825,t1_fkmqrge,1584357650.0,Can u still have the ceremony amongst family and host a reception later? I know it's not ideal but Atleast u won't have to prolong the marriage itself
weddingplanning,fkn82d9,t1_fkmslje,1584357474.0,2 people flying in and part of my wedding party told me they most likely won't be able to make it. Frustrating? Yes but at the end of the day their doing what they can in their capacity. And part of the reason I pushed for a change is bc I can anticipate more messages of cancellations like this and im just tired of dealing with it and looming what ifs over my head for the next few weeks honestly
weddingplanning,fkn7aus,t1_fkn6hbn,1584356588.0,"I posed this question yesterday for my 4/18 wedding and since then we have decided with a fall wedding. Ive already written up a statement to mass text everybody along with an updated save the date picture. There were no summer options for me and honestly I don't want to be in this position again to have to change if things don't resolve this summer. Il prolly cancel if I have to deal with this again.

I know it's a sacrifice and extra work on top of wedding planning already is but it'll be worth it to have everyone there. I'm so sorry I know how you feel."

weddingplanning,fklq4ln,t1_fklpufe,1584312123.0,I'm worried bout August too but we have religious restrictions that I just found out about so August doesn't work for us anyways. Il be praying for you that things get better asap and the guest size seems reasonable!
weddingplanning,fkloi6m,t1_fkln67z,1584311124.0,Honestly I'm proud of you for making the choices as brides it's a huge sacrifice and added stress for us but at the end of the day it's the safety of the loved ones we want to celebrate. I'm in the midst of working on my updated save the dates too
weddingplanning,fklih3l,t1_fklicko,1584306996.0,I was debating October too even tho it's soooo far away but it's def much much safer at that point. Summer has no dates available anyway
weddingplanning,fklhd2d,t1_fklgrmj,1584306324.0,"I'm a LI bride too! And I'm 80% sure il be rescheduling bc I can't stand the back and forth esp for a 300 person wedding with a lot of people being over 65 including parents on both sides. Esp with Cuomo banning large gatherings. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. I'm so sorry and I'm in the same boat this day has been so stressful Ive been contacting vendors and venue and some can't even make it to the potential dates I may change it to. And my MIL asked me as well and the in laws have to fly in for the wedding too

Please stay strong and do what's best for you! Honestly I feel like rescheduling will also give me a peace of mind from all this crazy anxiety Ive been having and EVERYBODY asking me the same question ""are you still having it?"""
weddingplanning,fklgtbq,t3_fj7sso,1584305995.0,What is a safe time to reschedule to? My wedding is 04/18 and Ive already gotten multiple texts from ppl not being able to fly in. Is September too early still? What have you guys been contemplating?
weddingplanning,fkl7me3,t3_fj4pvd,1584300253.0,"Honestly the venue may be treating it normal but u have to take account of ur guests wanting to attend. My wedding is 04/18 and Ive had five texts from ppl saying they most likely won't make it. We have a lot of older guests so even tho my venue is treating it normal with no changes there's no point of it to me if so many of my guests are going to cancel / won't be able to attend

Edit; my guest list is about 300 people"
weddingplanning,fkjccx3,t1_fkfdtl2,1584241923.0,Same date. I most likely will be postponing. Just today alone Ive had 5 people (with +1 ) tell me they won't likely make it and I know this is the start. It's gonna be more and more ppl telling me the same thing. Esp since a good amount are elderly people I can't risk my parents nor my in laws who may not even come bc they have to fly in. Now my worry is WHEN do I change the date to. If I do Sept and this isn't resolved I can't KEEP change it again. Also I called my venue and there's VERY few days to change it to and summer is out the question. SIGH.
weddingplanning,fkjbraz,t1_fkgnt08,1584241464.0,I contacted my venue today (4/18 wedding) and there's a few Fridays available in Sept. Summer is a no go. Makes me so sad and now I feel pressured to change by this weekend or THOSE dates will be gone too
weddingplanning,fkjbmdh,t1_fkgtnzw,1584241356.0,I'm so sorry! I hope u can fight this somehow with the airline I can't believe they wudnt reimburse that.

weddingplanning,fkhwaq6,t3_fih69a,1584207168.0,I'm in the same boat. My wedding is a week away from yours. Praying things work out but honestly if I have to reschedule then I guess it'll be. I never thought in a million years a virus wud be a reason to ruin my wedding!

weddingplanning,fk74oks,t3_feisnu,1583927602.0,I'm definitely stressed out. my reception is late April in New York and even though we don't have many people flying in our guest list is at 300 with a lot of my parents friends who are over 50+ years of age. And granted it can be worse but just in the past few days the # of cases have increased in NY alone. I havent cancelled yet bc I want to see how the next few weeks will turn out albeit it won't be good
Sephora,fivi0wt,t1_fivhtae,1582760684.0,Honestly I may just do that and get rid of my points and be done with Sephora for good. If it's an amazing redemption then I may consider staying

weddingplanning,fgqvipl,t1_fgqe5dr,1581032381.0,This is exactly some of the fears I have! I guess since the job market is abysmal I see myself being stuck here forever but ur absolutely right. There's so much worse things to deal with then having nasty coworkers retaliate I just wish I was stronger to deal with that. But I just need to develop thicker skin. And it's totally worth it for them to feel not being invited and not enabling their shitty behavior. Thank you for wording it out and making me aware!
weddingplanning,fgq02v6,t1_fgpsboe,1581015309.0,"Thank you for the positive comments ❤️ I wish I worked with the people in this subreddit I'd invite everyone in a heartbeat 😂 yeah I think my nature is too forgiving for example if they act nice to me aka professional I get in my head that maybe I'm over reacting and it becomes a series of really exhausting mental trips. I second guess myself in social situations when I shudnt give a sh*t

I will consider HR if another event pops up. I have documented the previous incidents so I'm ready but I'm hoping to just have a new job by then so I cud just put the nasty work environment behind me.

Thank you 🤗"

I have been job hunting everyday but the market is so saturated (I work in healthcare) we are basically supposed to be grateful we even have a job. I still have my hopes il be outta there soon tho. And the sad part is I didn't even realize it was toxic until it was Soo long in that this isn't a normal work environment.

Thank you for the advice it reverberates how I feel but too scared to actually do so I need the push"

And I agree. Being an adult now I find it so hard to even get to see my friends let alone coordinate a gaming session with them. I'm happy youre able to execute that! That sounds so fun!"
