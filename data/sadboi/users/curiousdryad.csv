I’ve had bright green hair for 4 years now, my original color is jet black. My hair lifts very easily actually, and is  healthy for what it’s been through minus one time I decided to strip the color and go peach(regrets!!)

Anyways, I naturally have frizzy middle eastern hair, so having bleached hair on top of that makes my hair even more frizzy(I live in a humid area!)

Is there anything you can recommend (even product wise) to manage my frizzy and make my hair look smoother? People compliment my hair all the time but obviously you’re going to be your own worst critic. My hair is okay when I blow dry it but once my natural curly frizzy starts to kick in a few hours later, the only way I can manage it really is by doing a twist bun to lay down the frizzies"

I’d advise taking it at the same time every day. At night time to avoid drowsiness. You need to eat at least 350 calories. So I just take mine from a 7-9pm window after dinner. 

When I tappered up I felt nauseous and dizzish when I woke up for a few hours then I was fine. For about 4 day’s after a taper up. But I also have GI issues and get nausea easy. 

The worst for me was lack of sleep. I’d always wake up at 3am. I was put on latuda to help and it definitely  did, a LOT. But I can’t afford latuda. So I just smoke weed"

puppy101,fo6i00v,t3_g5vdq7,1587559298.0,"It’s normal to feel this way. There are small things you can do to mitigate it. 

One, always crate him when gone. Two if you’re worried about watching him get a furbo. Three don’t leave toys around or in his crate that are easily destructible/something he can choke on. 

You can train him drop it when eating sticks on his walks. You can trim his nails and teach him not to jump on you by saying “down”   Plenty of these feelings can be avoided with simple training. 

I was right there with you, exactly 26 years into my life and finally able to get a dog. It’s stressful. Always will be. But many things can be avoided."
