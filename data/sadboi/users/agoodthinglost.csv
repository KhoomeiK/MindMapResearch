Also in my therapy we do “body work” (which basically uses weighted and heated pillows and blankets on different sections of the body) and some art therapy too. I think the meditation has helped the most just because it taught me how to breathe during stressful moments and be more mindful of what I was feeling when I’d be flipping out."
ptsd,f11madk,t1_f10wl2k,1569127485.0,"Wow, how terrifying all of that must have been for you. I also had a breathing tube in the ICU and the moment they pulled it out after the second surgery was harrowing. It still gives me nightmares. I definitely sympathize with you. 

I’ve had a couple of full panic attacks since I got out, both relating to the idea of being sick/going back to the hospital. Once when I thought I was having abdominal pains again (it was menstrual cramps) and recently when I actually went to urgent care for a weird rash (it was allergies). Everything feels so code red right now, like you said. I’m glad you’re talking to others and glad it’s helping. I definitely need to do the same."
ptsd,f11kez2,t1_f10hati,1569126775.0,"Gosh, that sounds awful and I’m so sorry. I wasn’t even clear on what sepsis/septic shock was before it happened to me -- boy, is it serious. 
Right now I’m seeing a therapist who specializes in body trauma, weirdly enough (I’m lucky to live in a major city where a therapist could even be this specific) and we do a lot of body work and meditation, which helps. I’m really tripped out on the idea of why and how, though. My illness was very random and sudden (I was definitely that “I just thought I had a cold and then literally almost died” person) and the doctors have told me many times I couldn’t have prevented it or guessed it would happen. Like I said, I had never been to the hospital or had a surgery before in my life (I’m 40!) so processing all of it has been tough. I definitely have the hyper-vigilance and anxiety of wondering if it’ll happen again. And the depression and anger, too. I wish I could find a support group for this kind of thing. :("
ptsd,ezveduy,t1_eympadk,1568175133.0,"Thanks for sharing. I also went through a near death experience (a sudden illness that forced me to have two life saving surgeries) about eight months ago and I’ve been struggling ever since. The anger is a BIG emotion for me as well. I was lashing out at family, coworkers, random people working at the coffee shop; I’ve never done that kind of thing before. I’m in therapy now but thinking I still need some context/support so this book seems like something I could use. Thanks."
