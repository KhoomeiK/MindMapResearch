Your mom seems incredibly toxic. Please move away from her. Get in touch with your dad, maybe he can be more supportive. Put any anger you have towards a physical activity. Even if you don’t lose weight, being active can do amazing things for your self esteem.  
  
Also you said you wanted to study law. So do it! I’ve failed so many classes because it wasn’t something I wanted to study. If you’re actually interested in the subject it can make a huge difference.  
 I’m rooting for you."
