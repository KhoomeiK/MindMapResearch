The reason why I mentioned '' Remaster '' is because of two reasons. The majority these days won't play an old game if it's not remastered for them. Secondly, if Dead Space's remastered sales meet EA's expectation, they might probably re-consider letting the developers make a Dead Space 4. But hey, I doubt it will happen, Battlefield, Fifa, Star Wars games bring them an enormous amount of money that surpasses Dead Space's sales in miles."

This happened to anyone who was new to university unless if you were the top star in the city and everyone threw the tips at you like hot peeper!

If I count my lost years, then I should have graduated, but sadly, I'm struggling same as you, but is it worth it to kill yourself for that piece of junk? many got a degree and they haven't found a job for 10 years in my country. Some of my friends actually became broken because of that thing since they did not lower their expectations. I'm not saying it's their faults, but it is crucial to always predict the worst.


All I can tell you is, good job, you tried your best that what matters. Be proud that you gave it your all, and now you can do much better than before ( if the motivation is still with us ofc). 
Use this, and hopefully it helps you
"" lower your expectations and you will never be disappointed. Lean on yourself and don't expect others to be there""

As you said, this needed deep planing for it work as they intended.
