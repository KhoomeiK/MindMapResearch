depression,fr6ikv5,t3_gmsi04,1589926925.0,I’ve started noticing this under the last couple of years and it only gets more apparent after each day that passes.

confidence,fpopees,t3_gend1x,1588788382.0,Any tips of you want to cut of your friends? I’m scared of ending up completely alone and I’m not good at socializing so it’s likely I won’t get new friends.
misanthropy,fpoddol,t3_geg3hx,1588782596.0,I’ve had to deal with constant assholes my whole life and my friends recently turned out not to care about me so I’m thinking about cutting them off. My dream job is a job where I can stay at home and don’t have to interact with anyone.
depressed,fofnetl,t3_g70cst,1587739399.0,It works for me too.
depressed,fo88s8w,t1_fo87i2o,1587591968.0,"I just want to share a little experience I had with lucid dreaming. This dream was semi-clear but I had a bit of control. I remember I wanted to fly so I jumped and then flew out of my window. It was pretty unclear how I went out the window but I did and then I flew in the sky for a bit not too far away from the ground. It was night outside and I could feel raindrops hitting me. That felt ultra realistic and thinking back at it, it was awesome! I flew down to a tree to check a leaf on it for some reason but when I checked I noticed it was a feather instead. Yeah dreams can be pretty random."
depressed,fo8713m,t1_fo86g42,1587591046.0,I just feel it’s important I tell you of a downside that exists. There is something called sleep paralysis and I don’t know if you’ve heard about it. It can happen even if you don’t lucid dream but it’s more likely it may happen when trying to lucid dream. I hope this didn’t put you off. I would say it’s still very much worth it since it’s so amazing. I still haven’t even experienced a complete lucid dream yet and I’ve heard from people that it can be super realistic! I never do anything fun anyways so I’ll gladly taking the small risk of getting sleep paralysis for doing something so amazing. Hope you still decide to go for it!
depressed,fo863pa,t1_fo85q1r,1587590566.0,It’s a way to make dreams more realistic. It’s kind of like you’re aware that you’re dreaming and if you practice enough you’ll be able to move around at free will and do stuff. I’ve only managed to stay in a lucid dream for about a few seconds but it was really cool! While writing all this I know it sounds very ridiculous and I didn’t believe it at first but now I’ve even experienced it myself! You should search for lucid dreaming on YouTube.

mentalhealth,fnwcoy5,t3_g43t45,1587315856.0,For me it was rather that (mostly) all of them turned into toxic assholes or they just didn’t care about me anymore.

SuicideWatch,fnrw02l,t1_fnrs5r4,1587203725.0,The way your parents are handling this is making me pissed. They are supposed to take what you say seriously and aid in getting the help you need and deserve. I’m sorry you have to go through all of this and having to do college at the same time must be really difficult.
depression,fnrvvy8,t1_fnrrtnz,1587203598.0,Yes I really recommend playing it.

depression,fnq5qiz,t3_g34hia,1587158190.0,I think it’s kind of scary how society reinforces smiling and acting happy and that you should keep on smiling no matter how bad it gets. I don’t say it’s a bad thing to smile but being pressured into going against your true emotions can be damaging.
SuicideWatch,fnq0hkw,t3_g353u5,1587155362.0,"fuck, indeed."
depressed,fnpxxis,t1_fnpvwei,1587154015.0,Yeah I did try lucid dreaming about a year ago or so and managed to get very light lucid dreams that weren’t too realistic but the were indeed lucid dreams. It’s been the coolest experience of my life. I unfortunately had to stop since it did mess a bit with my sleep to try and lucid dream. Can’t afford that right now while going through hell. I will pick it up again soon. One thing I’ve gained though is that my regular dreams are a lot more clearer which is cool in itself.
SuicideWatch,fnpxo4z,t1_fnpvrpl,1587153878.0,Damn I hate how life is a bitch to some people. It’s so unfair to see all this suffering.
depressed,fnpxfsi,t1_fnpsr6m,1587153757.0,I can understand that. Well for me it’s quite troublesome right now and has been for the last year or so since I’ve felt extra crappy and don’t really enjoy my hobbies as much as I did before.
SuicideWatch,fnpx87v,t1_fnps6tl,1587153647.0,Thank you
SuicideWatch,fnps2j0,t1_fnprq5q,1587150963.0,I’ve also felt completely sure. Then somehow if I wait it out for perhaps a week or something like that I’m suddenly not sure anymore. I may still be suicidal but I’m not sure if I really want to die. I’ve had a knife to my wrist a lot of times but I’ve never dared to do anything. For how long have you been sure?
SuicideWatch,fnprrnj,t1_fnpqoxp,1587150804.0,"I hate how I don’t know how to help you. I’ll answer your question out of respect. I tried playing in sports but almost my entire team froze me out or said bad things about me so after seven years I couldn’t continue anymore so I quit. Now I like to create stuff, music and art you know. I’m sorry your life is how it is. Can you do one request for me and really think this through? I mean don’t you have things you actually want to do? Some kind of goal? I’m sorry if my comment feels a bit ignorant. I don’t want to be."
SuicideWatch,fnpn0dl,t1_fnpmdh1,1587148363.0,I did try to reach out to a website but I got an automatic response saying they didn’t have time or my submission was irrelevant. I guess I just had bad luck in that case but unfortunately I haven’t dared to reach out again.
SuicideWatch,fnpmhu2,t3_g2yxz5,1587148102.0,As someone who constantly gets rejected and never have had a relationship with a girl I see myself in this post. The last time I was suicidal was only yesterday and now I still feel like shit because a lot of messed up stuff keeps on happening. Please respond I don’t want you to do anything to yourself. Do you have any interests/hobbies?
depressed,fnplbko,t3_g36hk3,1587147509.0,"I believe people work and stuff to earn money so they can do the fun things they want to do or hang around with their friends in their free time. The problem is, not everyone has a fun thing to do in their free time or don’t have friends to spend time with. Then I don’t know why you should live. The only reason I’m living right now is because I have a set of interests I want to work with. The thing that’s driving me forward right now is the possibility of me achieving the ability to work and live of those interests. I certainly don’t now but I know it’s a possibility. Don’t you have anything you like doing? Please let me know since I’m interested in knowing"
SuicideWatch,fnpk46y,t1_fnpcg6s,1587146898.0,It’s really hard to reach out. I’ve heard stories of people’s live getting better after reaching out and stories of the opposite happening. I’ve not reached out myself yet though so I can’t say I have any experience myself. I’m going to be a bit hypocritical and say it’s good to reach out though.

depression,fnph87o,t1_fnpgu6p,1587145459.0,Well I can say it’s certainly not normal nor okay to tell someone to end it if they’re tired of someone.
depression,fnpewsx,t1_fnpern3,1587144302.0,That’s just messed up. I’ve been called childish and that I should get over it but I’ve never been told to “go though with it”. How can someone say something like that?
depression,fnpekkm,t3_g33rqu,1587144133.0,"So basically friends don’t like you, they like what you can offer.

SuicideWatch,fnocx59,t3_g2ww7b,1587120843.0,My dream scenario is that you unlock “sandbox mode” and can do whatever you want after you die but that just feels highly unlikely. My strongest believe is unfortunately that there will be nothingness which is very anticlimactic.

ForeverAlone,fmkymq8,t1_fmjvqa2,1586173458.0,Yeah it’s actual worth it. I hadn’t played a VN in a while but yesterday I opened one up which is based on an anime I watched a long time ago (it might be the case that the anime is based on the VN idk) and I actually played for two hours straight and enjoyed all of it.

I guess I could do a better job at reaching out to family but I never have any interesting things to talk about and I can tell most of my family members don’t enjoy my company. I don’t really have any close friends but I do reach out sometimes. The problem is that my friend group isn’t that welcoming. I hear about evens that my friends have that I’m never invited to and when I try to host events or attend something there is always someone acting toxic.
