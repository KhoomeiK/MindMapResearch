TooAfraidToAsk,f30g3q8,t3_df2oul,1570553640.0,it definitely could be. I think panic attacks are different for everyone but this sounds like one imo. I personally experience them differently but thats not to say your experience isnt valid! Im sorry you went through that. Try looking up the 54321 grounding technique its pretty helpful for panic attacks <3

selfharm,f28ts2u,t3_dck6vl,1570070494.0,ive been doing this too :-( i get really nauseous and anxious. im sorry u feel like this but just know ur not alone and my dms are always open <3
AMA,f28bai0,t1_f28ao78,1570057166.0,Definitely that therapy can either help a ton or not help at all but thats mostly up to you. You have to really look into yourself to find motivation. Dont count on others to fix you. Personally therapy was hard for me because at the time I was 13-14 and VERY stubborn which ended up doing me more harm than good. So I guess my best advice is to recover for you and recover because there are so many beautiful things to experience and an eating disorder truly blinds you from those things. Tell him I’m sending him my well wishes and hope for his recovery <3

selfharm,f1cdgej,t3_d8mhc7,1569355291.0,CONGRATS!!! you got this keep pushing through!!
depression,f19qhvo,t3_d8dkux,1569276218.0,not everyone has depression but everyone experience depression. for example if someones dog dies they would be depressed for a while and then move on. someone with depression will feel depressed even if nothing bad has happened. (this isnt the case for every person with depression this is just kinda an r/explainlikeimfive explanation)
teenagers,f19q177,t3_d8dkwt,1569275929.0,find something you two have in common and branch off from there :-)
selfharm,f0wzn6c,t3_d71xl7,1569017540.0,you got this!!
teenagers,f0wzkqt,t3_d71xtb,1569017487.0,"damn, yeah."
selfharm,f0wzj4e,t1_f0wak6m,1569017452.0,thank you so much <3 i’ll definitely take that advice
depression,f0uygbd,t1_f0uy1sj,1568955350.0,oh thats good! hopefully when fall/winter comes you can be in nature more :-) hope these feelings pass soon <3
depression,f0uxsza,t1_f0uxari,1568954623.0,damn. maybe if it cools down at night? i think the desert can be really nice! i live in a hot area too :-/ sorry these feelings are affecting you. i do know that it does get better though! i havent felt that feeling in a little while now so just keep in mind it will pass <3
depression,f0uwxq5,t3_d6pne7,1568953670.0,omg i get this feeling all the time!!! i hate it but what usually helps me is going out in nature. not sure if it will affect you the same as it does me but i always feel more “at home” in nature
selfharm,f0uwti4,t1_f0uw25x,1568953543.0,it did stop bleeding so i dont think i need stitches (although i did consider it but after some research i dont think stitches would be necessary) im definitely not worried for my health! just mentally feeling super weird about it
SuicideWatch,f0uwpjr,t1_f0uve6r,1568953424.0,"i totally agree. i just meant feeling pain in other ways that arent as permanent such as rubber band snapping, ice, etc."
SuicideWatch,f0upwyr,t1_f0uphod,1568947325.0,yeah i resonate with that. if i were you id start with trying to explore pain in a healthier way than self harm to appease those thoughts/feelings. but then again i am no psychiatrist and all i say is just my 2 cents! i hope ur able to stay safe and learn more about yourself :-)
SuicideWatch,f0uprh0,t1_f0uo9me,1568947208.0,yeah i know! just observing based on the situation i feel like jumping straight to self harm it could be healthier to explore where the feelings come from first if that makes sense :-)
SuicideWatch,f0ump3r,t3_d6nokk,1568944822.0,ngl u might just be a masochist. imo cutting doesnt really feel “good”
ambien,ez16xo5,t3_cztrw2,1567645736.0,never done shit for me but i guess if it floats ur boat

Minecraft,eyxdg8u,t3_czc3z5,1567550587.0,Super cool! Im not a builder but maybe adding something to the bottom? I think vines and leaves would add a lot to this :-)
Needafriend,ey6henb,t3_cvul14,1566855663.0,yooo what games on pc? im more of a dog person but i love cats almost as much :-)
selfharm,exjq6j4,t1_exjpobj,1566357122.0,"honestly it might surprise you. i sat next to one girl my freshman year and she was one of the popular girls with like 50 boyfriends and a million friends. one day she saw my scars and i was like “ah shit here we go again” but she just said “yeah ive done that too, im sorry youre sad” and damn i was so surprised but out of the 1000+ ppl at my school ive met about 1 person who reacted poorly to my self harm. amd honestly if people react poorly fuck them! its none of their business to judge others based on their struggles. hold out for the kind ones <3 pm me any time love"
SuicideWatch,exjpeph,t3_ctarkn,1566356503.0,not sure if you’re an animal person but goddamn it dogs are so fucking cute there just might be a reason to life for them
selfharm,exjpbnh,t3_ctarrk,1566356434.0,Im 15 and I had a very understanding s/o a while back. He didnt necessarily get it per se but he wasnt judgemental about it. In my experience people our age are usually nicer about self harm than you would think
SuicideWatch,exjmk2j,t3_ctae00,1566354282.0,yikes. I don’t think you can be charged for anything as you never told her to hurt herself. i think its only a crime if you provoke it? not 100% sure on that but at least morally you’re not in the wrong man
SuicideWatch,exjexnn,t1_exj89hq,1566348735.0,thank you <3
Needafriend,exj3bwm,t3_ct6dqs,1566341070.0,You sound like a rad dude. Im almost 16 and a pokemon fan for sure :-). id love to hear about teaching and bleach mixtures lol

SuicideBereavement,exg4ydx,t3_csmx90,1566255582.0,I wish he would have told someone he was struggling. I wish he wouldnt have left his two suicidal sister behind. I wish he would have talked to me more. I wish he knew that he didn’t have to be a genius to be important.
depression,exd7q2c,t3_cs2ogj,1566169376.0,i believe sometimes we have to live for someone else while we learn to live for ourselves. it’s definitely hard but having at least one thing keeping me going is the reason im still alive and surviving
SuicideWatch,ex8f2ft,t3_crmoq7,1566072518.0,"i wish i would have seen this earlier. i really relate to the statement you made about not choosing to be born a certain way. im so sorry op, i wish i would have reached out sooner. you couldve used a friend. i truly hope youre alive but if not i hope you somehow see that people truly care about you. sending love to you wherever you are"
selfharm,ex5dfjn,t3_crey6x,1566021564.0,sometimes mine turn pink or purple and sometimes they’re white/light pink. Don’t really know why

SuicideWatch,ewz7a4c,t1_ewxcrko,1565892092.0,Thank you that helps a lot. Im hoping to get a formal diagnosis for some of the ADHD symptoms and figure out how to fix that. I hope you’re right that they are symptoms and not unfixable. Thank you
