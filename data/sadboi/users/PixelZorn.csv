Of course every political or economical party/ ideology is painting / dreaming of its ideal world. and we all know that this planet is far from being this fantasy :) so what is the solution? to compromise ... and IMHO this is the Basis of a functional political landscape ... forces that do not block or hate each other .... but that work together in the interest of the people .... (and this again is an ideal dream ;)) 


2. &4 Allright, i got that point. it is interesting to understand your (american) view on politics ... it heavily revolves around the economy itself (that's just an observation, not an accusation). which is quite alien to me as in my country, the people are more in the focus of political decisions. you truly believe in the power of the market, which (in my opinion) is heavily unbalanced.


3. good to see/read/hear

And yes, by European standards, the whole US is quite ""right wing"" - as in capitalistic and nationalistic. and this is where my comparison is coming from. because there are also the two traits that stand out.

so what i find interesting is, what you say about Hitler and Mussolini using more ""left wing"" policy regarding their economic strategies.

i will answer in the same fashion - this is making things easier

1. check

2. when the government only consists of executional and judicial powers, that basically is an authoritarian society. there is no legislativ instance to control the others.

3. this is not only about countries and trade. this is about a mixed society of all ethnicities and believes. mosques next to temples, next to churches. Pro or Con?

4. see two ... without parties ... who is running the State?

5. it is more about political Opposition. It IS about willing to sacrifice freedom & rights for the sake of others. (stay at home to protect the ones who are weak)

6. fair enough. check."

you don't consider yourself an Anarchist (no order, no law, no society) do you?

what you (maybe not you personally, but the ""right wing"") strive for is more or less a dictatorship by claiming you don't want the government to be involved - sounds controversial, but that's exactly what the goal of both .. right-wing and fascism is. They don't want an opposition involved ... that is more like it. 

to cite wikipedia:

Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe"

So this one bloke (let's call him Vince) showed up to his Interview, but his Portfolio and the whole Impression he gave was underwhelming. We agreed NOT to hire him. A couple of day later (it was a friday) he called, but the HR-wifey was on vacation, so someone else took the call. Vince asked, at what time he should start working on monday (he die NOT ask wether he got the Job or Not!) - the girl who took the call was surprised and answered ""Erm, at 9am-ish I guess...?"".

So when he showed up on monday, IT complained, that they die not know he was coming and that it's always the same ... noone tells them ... but the setted up a computer and an account for him, so he started working.

2 years ago .....
my girlfriend came home from a party 
..  bit drunk nd tipsy and horny AF! of course I did not refuse ...

being at it for a couple of minutes, we changes positions and she started to ride me. She really got carried away, because she started to lift her pelvis higher 
... and higher and it felt my dick was going to slip out of her and just when i thought ""Oh god, please be careful, i don't want to get my dick broken"" ... excruciating hot pain went through my lower parts like a hot lightning ....

i pushed her off my lap and a primal scream left my throat ... everything hurt ... it felt like I broke my dick ... when the numbing veil of shock and pain was lifted, i suddenly realize she was crying ...

still under the impression of my own pain and the fear of having a broken dick, I bluffed ""Why are YOU crying???""
and then i saw it .... a small smear of blood on her inner thigh ... i check immediatly realized that this is not MY blood, but hers ...

i lifted her up, carried her down into the bathroom (clean and more light) and i checked on her .... what i saw sent shivers down my spine: both her inner labia had a clean ""cut"" approx. 3cm long, 1cm wide and maybe 2mm deep. and blood came gushing out of it.

She did not want me to call an ambulance, (she was still drunk and not capable of judging the seriousness of the injury) but I insisted and never the less called the emergency service. (luckily in germany we do not have to worry about the costs).
They gave her some quite strong pain medication and took us to the hospital, where a gynocologist looked at the injury and asked us a couple of questions ....  i let my GF do the talking, because there is quite an age difference (she was 20 and i was 37) and i did not want to give a wrong inpression for obvious reasons....

Gyn ""how did it happen?""
GF ""during intercourse.""
Gyn ""erm .. okay ... what .... erm ... KIND of intercourse?""
GF ""okay - i was coming hone and really really horny..""
Gyn ""no just ... how it happened.""
GF ""i was riding on his dick and got too excited, he slipped out and .. bang""

Gyn ""well, we might have to sew the injuries""
GF ""oh no! please don't!""
Gyn ""sigh.. okay - i will clean it and you come back here in 3 days. if it has not gotten significantly better - we will have to sew it.""
GF ""OK""
Gyn ""and 3-4 weeks no sex, to let it heal properly""
GF ""What???? How am i going to survive this?""

and then we were free to go.
already on the way out, she was like ""well, the painkiller kicked in ... we can continue ...."" and i was like ""whaaaaaat? no!nononoonno! NO!""

the injuries healed very quick .... and the celibacy lasted for 3 days until she wanted sex again...


so yeah, that was that.

lucky me is ""highly functioning depressive"" as i am able to go to work and get shit done ... aside from my private stuff, which is a growing mess.

i am constantly falling back into the black abbyss where nothing seems to help. i have created a whole set of skills together with my therapist, but they just don't work. my head is pure evil ... ""who're you trying to fool with these skills?"" .... i just cannot make it shut up. the same with mindfulness and meditation. the only thing that seems to help, is work ... that is distracting enough, but at the same time draining energy that i desperatly need ...."

AskReddit,ezevmci,t3_d0qp17,1567869409.0,"For me it is vice-versa.

I have dependent personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder (DPD & AvPD). My DPD wants me to befriend everyone ... And my AvPD doesn't want me to have (best) friends ...

So people Like me very much, and are very honest and open with me ... But at the same time I am not the one they would ask to Join them on a trip or to go out partying .... 


Sometimes i really suffer from that ... Noone will call/Text me .... And on others days i am very Happy to be alone by myself."
