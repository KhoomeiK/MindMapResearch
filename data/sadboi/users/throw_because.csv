LegalAdviceUK,fm8ay1r,t1_fm89lwh,1585846056.0,"That does help yes, I’ll try holding onto that. 
What about us as their parents though 
We’re definitely not under 20 :/"
LegalAdviceUK,fm893yn,t1_fm887bg,1585845097.0,"Your right 
I have so many fears about it, 
What if the people he works with have it and don’t know?
What if the people he works with have it and DO know but need to work so try hide it? This has happened. 
He won’t follow the rules re showering when home clothes straight into machine etc. Says he showers at work so no need.
He could potentially bring this thing back to a house hugely full of people and have no idea. No one knows how they will be with this. That’s where the fear sits mostly. 

I sound like an absolute karen here and I promise I’m not, Im just so scared. 

I beat anxiety 5 years ago after a long 20 year fight with it. This mia has me (and million’s of others) terrified.  

How do you know the danger isn’t that high? If you could reassure me I would really really appreciate it."
LegalAdviceUK,fm88063,t1_fm87wqj,1585844515.0,Definitely not where my family’s safety is concerned.
LegalAdviceUK,fm7w5bs,t1_fm7r0x2,1585838018.0,I u sweat and the first part but what do you mean about the second part?
HealthAnxiety,fm7hl8t,t3_ftesw6,1585827278.0,"Exactly the same as your title, losing my mind and not a clue how to sort it out :("
LegalAdviceUK,fm7gzbp,t1_fm7gqn1,1585826654.0,"Thank you. I’m devastated, my anxiety is literally about to send me insane. I think he’s more worried about that now."
LegalAdviceUK,fm7e2xm,t1_fm7d7ze,1585823504.0,"This is why he was off the last two weeks :( 

It’s the calm I can’t seem to do. Constant state of fear is a piece of cake though."
Anxiety,fm7d8ls,t3_ft3nko,1585822536.0,"I had pretty much 99.9% control over my anxiety until lockdown happened and the fear hit me of the severity. 
Lost all control and losing my mind ."
LegalAdviceUK,fm7cuz2,t1_fm7crc5,1585822103.0,"He has had the last two weeks because one of the kids has a “flu” and says that’s all they will allow him u less he says he is at well.
How long would he be entitled to self isolate due to my son with asthma? Is it still the two weeks or the 12 that I had at least planned when we were told? 
I’m sorry I’m rambling I’m not coping well."
HumansBeingBros,fm3xluj,t3_fsrgo7,1585740619.0,Made me cry. So lovely
TrueOffMyChest,fm3xi6k,t3_fskh38,1585740523.0,"I saw this and I’m almost crying. All I’ve done for 3 weeks is cry and have one long panic attack every day. 

My husband is due to go back to work next week and I’m terrified to let him.
We have 6 kids at home and one is asthmatic 
We haven’t left the house in almost 4 weeks and now him going back and forward to work is pretty much going to just defeat the whole purpose of all other 7 of us being locked in. 
I’m scared my my kids, myself and him too. 
I told him I’d rather he quit or stay at a hotel and now all we’ve done is argue over it. 
I’m not coping at all. 

I know I sound so selfish 
I’m so terrified"
labrador,fiqfu4x,t1_fiqdr91,1582643375.0,Yes! Lots of pictures is the best way. When they stay still long enough lol
