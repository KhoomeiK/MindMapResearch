You have to take into consideration that adderall is often abused, so with that comes greater risks. With having bipolar, it is common to abuse substances more than the average human"
bipolar,fk4q6q6,t1_fk4njt6,1583865436.0,"I would not take the stimulant if it had the same side effects as antipsychotics. It’s not worth it. I seem to have lost the genetic lottery when it comes to tolerating them without all of the awful side effects. 

Also, people mostly run into issues with adderall because they are abusing it. Just like anything, you and your pdoc have to discuss whether or not it’s worth the risk. As of right now, it seems like it is because my job is extremely important to me and I have been able to do my daily duties without forgetting simple details. But you’re absolutely right about my pdoc needing to approach those topics and disclose the seriousness of any side effects. 

I have bp2 and have never experienced mania, and if adderall induced that for me it would be terrifying. I have a good husband and support system that I know will watch out for me if anything like that were to happen"

bipolar,fk4a80z,t1_fk41y62,1583856464.0,"Yeah I have heard that too, especially about antidepressants because that seems to be a common occurrence in people finding out they have bipolar. Exactly what happened to me. I have not taken an antidepressant since. 

I have a really hard time with antipsychotics. The side effects have been really awful. I also have severe body image issues so weight gain is an absolute no from me. So your thoughts on being on less meds is something I agree with. I want to be on as little as possible only because once I introduce something else, everything goes south. However that may not be an option for me though, and I have to accept that. 

I have been nodding off at my desk almost daily even when I get enough sleep. I was getting frustrated to tears because I couldn’t do things thoroughly at work. Not able to focus on important things. Forgetting a lot of details that hurt my work performance. So far it has been an absolute game changer when it comes to my work ethic, tidiness of my home and not interrupting people constantly and being annoying. 

I somehow made it through college and earned a bachelors, but now all of a sudden 2 years post grad and working a steady career that has a work life balance, I am the most exhausted I have ever been when it comes to focusing. My pdoc said ADHD can get worse with age and that it can be debilitating. This whole time I thought ADHD was kind of a joke and that adderall was an excuse to feel superhuman. However I became desperate and realized how fucked I was feeling. It’s especially disappointing when I stick to a strict workout and sleep schedule and I’m still maybe functioning at a 65-70%

bipolar,fk40in7,t1_fk3a2rg,1583850688.0,"I can relate to not really eating so far. I try to eat a decent breakfast right before I take my adderall so that I don’t feel as shitty 

It took a minute to find my comfortable dose with lamictal. I dealt with a ton of stress that put me into a spiral, but we thought maybe my lamictal dosage wasn’t right so I went up to 300mg. That was awful for me, so I’m at 200 and it seems about right. I am not perfect, but there has been a lot of improvement compared to not being medicated.

I hope you find out a solution and things begin to work for you."

I think a lot of us go down the road of being diagnosed with different things first before getting down to the final boss (there is a lot of comorbidity with this illness and others, so even though I do have ADHD, I am very much bipolar lol). 

I got a Mood Disorder NOS diagnosis first, and within a short amount of time my pdoc was able to feel confident and comfortable with telling me I’m BP2. The whole grandiose thing and adderall sounds similar to other people’s stories because they claim it made them manic/hypomanic, which is exactly what I am worried about. However I think as long as I’m not abusing it I should have better outcomes.

I’m hoping you find something that works for you, and it’s really awesome that you’re going into treatment with an open mind and are prepared to accept any things that come your way. Best of luck!!"

I get inside my own head enough to where I feel like I am human trash and I am broken, and if he were to threaten to hate me or not speak to me it would make me have days that I hate myself that much more unbearable 

I am not sure on how I would respond because when you are in a marriage and when you depend on someone it can push you towards staying together even when it’s not healthy... however that would not sit well with me and really push me away to where I would probably consider leaving if they did not take drastic measures into educating themselves and showing RESPECT AND SUPPORT rather than resentment. 

Resentment is probably one of the WORST things a partner could show towards you when you are battling something as brutal as bipolar disorder. Taking accountability is key, but our partners also have to educate themselves and do as best they can in understanding what we deal with every fucking day 

Sorry for ranting"

Although an ultimatum is not always healthy on either side, it sounds like he REALLY needs to attend a support group. I am getting the vibe that a support group might be something we would roll his eyes at but that is not fair to you. 

I understand that being with someone who is bipolar can be so difficult... but there is no excuse to say things like that. He can say that you need to take your meds and be compliant so that your relationship has a chance of not being as rocky, but he should NEVER give you the silent treatment or say he will hate you. 

My husband has a difficult time understanding this diagnosis and gets very frustrated because he does not understand how much work I put into being healthy every day. If I relapse he gets so irritated. But it would be a completely different story if he spoke to me that way."

BipolarReddit,f6hf5de,t3_dr9syl,1572845789.0,"I have been on Lamictal since April. The first couple weeks I was unable to sleep, although I did feel some improvements in mood. I was terrified to get the rash like you were, because it can be so stressful to be put back into square one. You need to just remind yourself that it’s okay for some things not to work out. It is not easy but as long as you’re seeing the psychiatrist and establishing a treatment plan, you are heading in the right direction. 

I wish you luck with this medication! I have just upped my dose to 300mg and I am feeling relatively stable. I am always preparing myself to be open to other treatment options in case this stops working for me. No matter what happens, we are winning half the battle because we are fighting to be better."
bipolar,f3dad66,t1_f3d97sa,1570833885.0,That’s how it was for me last night!! I really hope it goes away
bipolar,f31xymb,t1_f31x8qs,1570587771.0,"We both go to separate therapists but there is so much resentment in our marriage and how we operate. It’s been very, very difficult. I want to believe it will get easier. I think he has a lot to learn about bipolar and he has a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I won’t always be 100 percent after continuing treatment. It’s been devastating for both of us when I am not well. But he thinks that if I am not well it’s because of something I’m doing wrong"
bipolar,f31wefr,t1_f31ujh9,1570586556.0,Is there anything that has been helpful for you in understanding her or finding support? Things have been so difficult
bipolar,f31tqti,t1_f31qr2m,1570584553.0,I am very compliant with my meds.
bipolar,f1f9ysd,t1_f1edbr9,1569439922.0,"Have you been under more stress than usual? I have been on a successful incline for the past 5 months, but we renovated our home and I was faced with some pretty brutal circumstances and I think a lot of my obsessive thoughts/anxiety are triggered by this current stress. I am kind of putting this together right now, because I am desperate to get out of this rut I am in.  My stress levels seem to be the only thing that has changed over the last month"
bipolar,f1eon3r,t1_f1edvco,1569426928.0,"Thank you. This meant a lot. I mostly obsess over conversations with my boss/ coworkers. I don’t have very many people to confide in, so it’s easy for me to share a lot of my personal life. I shouldn’t feel too embarrassed about most of the things I share.. but my anxiety is out of control. That’s because like you said, I am not sure on what the truth is for myself and what others think. I don’t always trust myself when it comes to judgement."

bipolar,epjiltw,t3_buvjcg,1559254426.0,"My friends who are closest to me have not become acquaintances but I do miss out on a lot. They understand that I need to live my life a certain way, but they didn’t believe me when I said I abuse alcohol and have a problem just because I drank as much as they did. Technically we were all deemed alcoholics per CDC guidelines but my alcohol consumption was ruining my life. 

I have troubles forming new friendships because I can’t just meet up for girls night on a Wednesday and get drinks, or go to dinner and a movie on Thursday. I find I need to stick to a strict schedule during the week (gym, eat a healthy dinner, take my meds & get 8 hours of sleep).  On weekends I MIGHT be able to treat myself to a couple drinks, but as soon as I find myself going out every weekend it springs me into self destruction. So I have to be careful with that. I don’t disclose my illness to many people so they think I am very conscientious about my health and they will make jokes about how they wish they could be disciplined and eat healthy or miss out on drinks. I wish I could have more fun. But my battery gets so drained, and it truly effects my performance at work and just life in general if I continue to go that route"

I do have an intensely sore jaw from clenching all the time though... that I think is from the lamictal. I don’t know man"
