Set goals. Understand the world is fucking shit. Even before corona. And if you still want to die, you can, no one is stopping you, but don't think anyone's life will stop when you do it, they will be heartbroken and they might cry for years, but they will ultimately move on,  because they have too. I'm not trying to be harsh, but this thought is something that made me think twice.. Did i really want to be remembered as the guy who hung himself? think of all the dead people you know, you might remember what they did in life, but you will definitely remember how they died. fuck that. why should I die because the world is so fucked and other morons seemingly don't care? so I die, FOR THEM? fuck no. Never. 

Do what makes you happy. If you don't know what that is you need to find out. If your depression makes you so numb you can't think straight long enough to form a goal or a plan, you should try medication. This is about where the road map ends because depression is largely in your head about personal matters. Try to think from a different perspective. If you blame yourself for something you did or should have done, try to forgive the younger version of yourself that made the decision to do that. 

One of the things that bring's me happiness I guess, is just being myself. being happy no matter what. I fully understand how shitty the world is, but, it's been like this for longer than I have been alive, and I don't feel like trying to change it anymore. I play games online, make music that only I will ever hear and I fuck around on twitch etc, this actually brings me happiness because I feel like a kid again. It's not much but it's pure and it's actually enjoyable.

There is no real answer to mental health issues. everyone is different, and this is why it's so easy to ball up and feel like no one else has ever had it so bad, because technically, your situation is entirely unique to you and they haven't. but, there are some things that work for nearly everybody. which is the only interesting thing about mental health!

Is my life amazing, Hell no. But do I allow the ignorance of other people to make it any worse? Fuck no, even if you change 1 person, they probably have 2 or more siblings who are just as stupid. Those people would have had me dead, twice already. I don't feel much for anyone who has ever put me in that mindset.

I make simple music, but at the end of the day, music is not largely interpreted as art, it's more about how it makes someone feel, which is subjective. know your crowd, know how they move, write music that makes them move. 

If you write melancholic music that tugs the heart strings, you only need one line that hits, the rest are preludes. its that one line that you are trying to hit home with people, so they remember you and your song. ie, if its a heartbreak song, throw in a backhanded philosophical saying that everyone knows ,maybe ""they say that it's better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all"" some BS like that makes people who are experiencing that feeling, remember your song.
