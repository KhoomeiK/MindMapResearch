AskReddit,fr0bzb0,t1_fr0b404,1589790287.0,"Very much so. I think that game design classes have a lot to say about how game narratives work, what makes them work and how gameplay supports and facilitates certain emotions and mindset in players, but the game design and art criticism people don’t really talk to each other much? 

Studying only the narrative within the games makes them just a movie’s poor little sister. But that’s often the most a person far removed from games can learn about them. 
And a lot of people in the industry and gamers themselves have an intuitive understanding of ludonarrative but don’t really have the critic’s vocabulary/background to describe it. 
At least that’s my impression so far"
AskReddit,fr0as7z,t1_fqzwjyj,1589789154.0,"That’s actually something I’ve been thinking a lot about. There are some games where them being interactive and structured as they are adds to the narrative, instead of just showing it as a movie. 

Some examples I can think about: 
This War Of Mine, where you are put into position to make tough choices as a survivor in a war-torn city. Gives it more immediacy than just reading about it and judging people, thinking - “if I was in their place, I wouldn’t...” 

Papers, Please - again, the pressure set in the game goals, gameplay loop and scoring system between doing right by the people, by the state or cutting corners altogether 

Bloodborne - pure visual storytelling, a play on a lot of gothic horror tropes, with confusion and relegation for you as a player to experience 

Dishonored - again, the test of what one will do with the power is pretty much presented to the player rather than just the character 

Frostpunk"
AskReddit,fr09yr2,t3_glr6jd,1589788385.0,"I do think that video games are an under appreciated storytelling medium. Some games I’d like to see discussed: 

Bloodborne, for visual storytelling in general and for re-interpreting gothic and cosmic horror

Night in the Woods, as a study of depression, coping with a changing world 

This War Of Mine - don’t really need to explain this one 

Animal Crossing - when they’ll look back at the Covid times and start writing essays on virtual communities 

Dishonored, IMHO one of the best examples of utilizing player agency and actions as a vector of telling a story 

That’s just a few from the top of my head"

Only that there is a segment of alt right drawn to Crusader and deus vult aesthetic, and they do flock to games like this).
