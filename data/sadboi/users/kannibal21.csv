PersonalFinanceCanada,fpliwrz,t3_gdy1iy,1588713526.0,"I’ve been in both situations although at different times so I can imagine how much this sucks. I was laid off in March because other colleagues didn’t want to have their hours reduced, the selfish bastards. Long story short, lawyer says I could claim wrongful dismissal but that will only entitle me to severance pay. 

Even if you manage to get severance pay, this will not solve your biggest problem (the mortgage). Which brings me to the second problem I had a few years back, I totally miscalculated my purchasing power by trying to own a house by the age of 30 instead of building wealth first. 

I want to tell you the hard truth because it took me months to realize it and the sooner you do it, the better. I ended up getting rid of the house at a loss and declared bankruptcy. This was not free but hey, lesson learned. I am now in my late 30s and have a decent equities portfolio, no debt and I’m even saving a portion of CERB.

Probably not what you were expecting as a solution but trust me, you can rebuild your wealth making $40K in only a few years. Financial literacy is essential and free for that matter."

On the other hand, I make the same money and don't have any of the above (no debt), not even cable TV or a TV for that matter. My morals are not better than anyone else but I've managed to save close to 30% of my income and get and additional 10% of return on my investments for the past few years . Granted, not easy, you need some discipline and you need to ignore the crowd and their meaningless material life goals but I could probably manage to be unemployed for a couple of years (not that I would like to touch my retirement investments) but I won't be in the streets. All in all, I'm down $8,000 because of the market but still sleep at nights knowing this is just one more economic downturn, similar to the other dozen we've had every 10 years.

What saddens me the most is that I try to explain this to my co-workers and how they should save and invest, even $100/month makes a difference, but it's just a moot point. They'd rather spend $40 at a bar every weekend."

If you're not gonna keep adding to your investments on a frequent basis, you need to buy a stock, and I mean just one to reduce transaction costs.
