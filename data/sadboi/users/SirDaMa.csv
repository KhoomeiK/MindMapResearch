medizzy,fqn73z8,t3_gjtgfj,1589489785.0,"When my son was approximately 1yr to 18 months old his mother would take cooked potatoes and blend them up to feed to him. One day I hear her screaming at the top of her lungs for me to come to her. I come to her and see my son in his high chair already blueish , panicked, not making a sound. His mother was frozen with panick, and fortunately I'm a cool , calm and collected, under a hail of gunfire type..plus , I under advisement of his pediatrician,  had taken a CPR class shortly after his birth. So I immediately snatched him up and flipped him over and hanging him by his ankles and gave him a couple smacks on his back and on the second one a perfectly sculpted sphere of potato, about the size of a marble came flying out of his mouth. 

Turns out this piece had fallen to the bottom of the blender and been chiseled, by the blades so to speak into this perfect little sphere. She just happened to miss it when feeding it to him. Needless to say, from that point  on,  his blended food was carefully strained and inspected before feeding it to him lol. Hes a teenager now btw :). 

I always think about what would have happened had I not been home or took that class. Scary stuff."

What I would suggest doing before you do anything else...buy a camera, conceal it outside next to your drive way. Take the box off throw it in the yard or somewhere. Then leave in your car. See if you can catch the culprit on camera retrieving it. Any variance of this will work. 

Or find out where you can buy them, more info about the product itself, maybe narrowing more info on it. Put a cam in your room. Start looking for a new roommate. Evict him. I hope it's not him, that would really suck. Goodluck."

Wellthatsucks,flvofgm,t3_frckad,1585528357.0,"Reminds me of the time I was selling my home. Left the realtor in charge so he could show(I had to leave the state immediately). We finally go to close and the people and my realtor all met there to do the walk through. 

So it was three floors including the furnished basement. Kitchen had almost identical wood flooring. Upstairs had a few bathrooms and one had issues so the water was turned off to the toilet. 

Apparently, some worker, or possibly the realtor, I could never nail this part down. But someone turned the water on. But to trigger this catastrophe you would have to flush the toilet. Someone flushed it. Then was kind enough to not turn off the water they just turned on. This put in place a chain reaction of terrible events. The toilet, once flushed would overflow the top, and wouldnt stop unless it was stopped or the water was off. 

The walk through. 

Just picture it. Happy couple with kids, both our realtors frothing at a fat commission. Everybody happy af. Door opens. The first thing they see is soaked carpet , and a completely warpped kitchen floor, much worse than ops. Also...giant hole in the ceiling above kitchen. But we're just getting started. 

So the toilet overflows. Floods a lot of the upper floor. Finally floods and fills the ceiling above the kitchen. It collapses into the kitchen. Floods kitchen, living room, parts of first floor. Fills the ceiling above my basement, btw brand new drywall and expensive carpet with the thickest padding(remember that lol).  Collapses it. Then fills the basement. Had it separated by a couple rooms and because of this, and the carpet padding, it filled the first room with about 2inches of water. So it took a long time to get to the laundry room and drain. Destroyed all the drywall, carpet of course. There hadnt been anyone in the house for at least 2 solid weeks. This multi level toilet waterfall of destruction just sat there running away the entire time. 

Yes, mistake were made, I know. 

Luckily...and i was pretty lucky on this one. But low and behold the buyers planned on gutting the house anyways. They still agreed to purchase as long as i agreed to the estimate their contractor gave me for complete repairs(of damage). I did of course. Estimate was just shy of 20k. My realtor did take some responsibility for it. Oh...and my at the time, young dumbass cancelled  my home insurance thinking it was ok because I left.  Yep, mistakes were made."

dating,fludrmz,t1_flu430k,1585500586.0,"Well, I was being a little retorical, of course all women dont feel that way.

A lot of them ask me why I always seem to date younger women as if I purposely go out looking for younger women. I absolutely do not.  But I do seem to run into this almost jaded type of thinking with women my age. Which inevitably ends up standing in the way of any blossoming relationship. One of my friends, shes actually 10 yrs my senior. She always argues with me that love is not real. Nothing I say will convince her. I look into her eyes though, and I know that's all just a bullshit defense mechanism. She desperately wants to be loved but doesn't believe anyone will love her again. 

I know it's really bad out here...dating that is. There seems to be this terrible culture surrounding it. I think the apps encourage it. Plus, naturally, some are either afraid to get hurt, or not really out here looking for a relationship...ie just want sex, or money as you mentioned. The settlers are the worst. A loveless relationship is a living arrangement, at best. But love , happiness, compatibility and true emotional connection is the only thing all of us should settle for. Period."

You got a 100 profit margin...that you gotta sit on for who knows how long banging out pounds. Or even worse, if your cutting deals on 5lb, 10lb, or 20lb sales. You gotta ask yourself wtf. Way easier ways to make money, and more of it. And I assume by the other guys comment that hes implying that only people in poverty are buying it, that severely limits your markets. Increases your odds of getting pinched and or getting robbed or killed. And excludes legal states. You can get legal reject weed by the ton these days so easy, and cheap, why go thru all the drama for such a small dangerous market. I guess hindsight is 20/20. Definitely not knocking it , believe me lol, but ffs I had no idea."
see,fltsv7g,t1_fltl451,1585486137.0,"Yeah but at what cost? I remember those days too. Sure you might come across some better than usual , but dirtweed is disgusting. Let's not confuse this with mids. Mids I'd smoke anyday even now. But brick weed from the 90s was terrible. I dont hate it, but it's all always moldy, usually contaminated with whatever they used that time to get it across the country, not to mention pesticides."
see,fltse5w,t1_flta3ow,1585485683.0,"That's actually really sad. No one...and I mean fucking no one should have to smoke that absolute garbage, especially this day in age. One more reason to federally legalize."
see,flts89m,t1_fltgamg,1585485526.0,"I mean regular will always get you high. As far as that brick from the ocean, it still may retain some thc content. But even if regular is still being sold now, that particular brick could of literally been in the ocean for a decade. It would taste terrible, and most likely have lost most of its thc content. (Ever found a sac you lost a year ago lol, if you have you know that exact stale taste it gets). Which would probably be the worst part about smoking it lol. 

One of my disbeliefs about regular still being sold is that I cant understand why anyone in their right mind would still smoke it. With all this good weed everywhere, even IF your broke, regular is notoriously moldy, all kinds of pesticides...will get you high cheaply ...but at what cost to your health. Even when I sold it, I never touched the stuff."
see,flt8gdf,t1_flt80yu,1585462743.0,Really??? That's news to me. I thought that went out when mids became a thing in the begining of 2000. Then again I've been out of that industry for almost 15yrs. Why would anyone buy that? In this current market? Why would anyone even produce it on large quantities? Seems like extremely short money(factoring everything it takes to get it across the country...unless your on the far west coast or next to Mexico itself...cant wrap my head around the financials of it)
see,flt79jd,t1_flsolac,1585461566.0,"Can confirm, a 5lb brick is about the size of a milk crate. 

Also, it looks like some straight up Mexican dirtweed from the 90s. Probably been in the ocean for decades. No one is or has smoked anything like that for at least 20yrs."

datingoverthirty,fls0yai,t3_fqkesc,1585432030.0,"I really just think that these are natural things that just need to be exercised out of your system. The old saying sowing your wild oats applies here. I think the serial monogamist or even the sometimes very unfortunate soul who marries when they are 18 to 20yrs old as a virgin(or never having been in a serious ltr), ends up married to someone who they find out is nothing like they want or needed by the time they hit their thirties... Or worse, wait till after the kids are older to end it, is destined to have these feelings. And boom it's time to sow some wild oats. 

Or you get someone like me, sowed tf out of some wild oats from high school on till I was 28. Married, 12 yrs later divorced. I could care less about casual sex now, doesnt mean I wont partake, but I'm happy either way. I also completely understand when a women says she wants to keep it casual. Cool. If we click we can enjoy each other, and  the experiences we'll have together. I'm always crystal about those situations. But someone less experienced will probably not be. But casual sex, involves a slippery valley, it's easy for either of us to catch feelings even when everyone is explicit about expectations. Believe me. So even if you are more direct understand these things happen. 

So lol, my advice would be casually date, just dont fuck. You can still get super freaky without that. This will allow you to instantly weed out the douchebags that just want to conquer your ass. Any good dude will be happy waiting. If your just out to get some fb loving, find one and use him for that while you date around. This keeps everyone, the fb dude, the daters, and most importantly you, all on the same page. And will save you a lot of time and bullshit."

oddlyterrifying,flqlxnz,t3_fqdrpx,1585399601.0,"Had a 90 gallon fish tank it had a foot and a half Gar in it. Loved that dude. Anyways, one day I come home and instantly realize he isnt in his tank. Freaking tf out, I realize my dude is on the carpet. Not moving. Dry. I was crushed at this point, I had had it for years at this point already. So I almost nonchalantly finally reach down to pick him up...and the poor bastard was literally dried to the carpet. I had to rip his skin off his body to peel him away from it. Gars are long and I was holding him like a stick at this point walking away from the tank to go bury him, when he all of sudden starts moving around!! I was like wtf?!?! I immediately tossed him back in the tank. Took over a month for it to heal from its skin being torn off. But that undying little tenacious bastard lived on for a long time after that. (The two inch gap was quickly covered up, not sure what it was thinking lol)."

I also feel like it's a thin line between people being extremely selfish and people with mental health issues.  And without knowing any particulars It would be impossible to make that distinction. I know three people who killed themselves. All three I would classify as selfish. Because of how they unfolded. But I look at a person like Bourdain, that seemingly came completely out of left field, seems like a mental health issue. I'm so sorry for your loss...one of them was my father too."
