I usually end my poems with the same starting sentence and I’m not sure why I didn’t with this one. I wasn’t feeling confident about this poem as I felt like there was something missing and you just pointed it out for me. Thank you so much for the advice and I’m glad you enjoyed the poem x"

BPD,f1b39ct,t1_f1b08xk,1569321808.0,"Thank you so much. I’m openly taking your hugs. I followed your advice and looked up thing to help and found one about holding ice in my hands. I tried it and felt good because it burned and gave me some degree of pain/discomfort but I wasn’t actually hurting myself. I feel like the cold helped calm me down too because as I started to get more upset, I was heating up, so reducing my body temperature must have helped decreased my heart beat so I could relax. Thank you again for your advice and care. Just getting a response from you and getting encouragement to get myself feeling better was enough to get me out have bed and have dinner with my boyfriend, even though it’s almost midnight here. I appreciate you x"
BPD,f0xosar,t1_f0xkhmb,1569040103.0,"That’s what I usually do. But I find that for me personally when I go out in nature and really focus on my surroundings it makes me feel a whole lot better, kinda like I’m at peace. After that the feeling usually goes away but will still come back after a few weeks or sometimes days"

BPD,f0n9e3n,t1_f0n67oc,1568764065.0,"It’s sad. Have you been told if it’s attributed to the BPD or is it something else? How do you handle it? My boyfriend tries to assure me that it’s not a bad thing because it makes us unique, but it’s frustrating because I feel so out of place all the time. How do you think we can control the changes? x"

AskReddit,f0655ic,t3_d3vazs,1568429508.0,"I just turned 20. 
I’m diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, depression and anxiety. Attempted suicide and was a self harmer. The most important thing I have learned is that it’s okay to not be okay. No one is ever 100% happy, and trying to be 100% happy will only break you more. 
I’ve learned to accept that there are really rough times in life for everyone, but things need to get really shitty in order for it to become fucking amazing later on. 
When you feel like you really have rock bottom, you know in your heart that it can’t get any worse, it can only get better if you put in the effort to do so."

mentalhealth,eriztjl,t3_c2avk6,1560911664.0,"I personally find getting in touch with my senses (taste, sound, touch, smell) and getting out in nature extremely helpful when I'm feeling super stressed. 

My physiologist always tells me that going out for walks is the best way to destress yourself. So, if you live near a nice park or beach or anything, trying going for a walk and focusing on the things around you instead of the things that are concerning you :)"
