Anxiety,fbwwezm,t1_fbwuv1g,1577161261.0,Yes. People with anxiety probably have an excess of stimulation and combined with the glutamine it’s terrible. Normal people are agitated after drinking and again that’s glutamine. Anxious people would just experience more anxiety than normal. What’s worse is this stimulation effects sleep and then causes depression. You will not get over it perhaps use to it but not over it. Sorry. Someone has to be the designated driver. When I was much younger I always used the excuse that I couldn’t metabolize alcohol like normal. Just a line when people were pressuring me to drink.
Anxiety,fbwufxf,t3_eevp1s,1577159739.0,Your problem is biological and it’s called glutamine. Since alcohol depresses your system your body produces a stimulant called glutamine to counter the effect. Once your done drinking your body yet produces the glutamine making you anxious. Anxious people will naturally feel even more anxious.

The jack ass that created problems was usually shoved in a locker or beat down, thus solving the problem. Locker rooms use to operate this way as well.
