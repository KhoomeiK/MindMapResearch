NCT,fiooaun,t3_f90gb0,1582587208.0,"[Here is the original](https://twitter.com/nctsmtown_127/status/1228335373224308736?s=21) and I hope you guys like this, it's the first full art piece i've ever done in this style ðŸ¥º"
BPD,f6wjj35,t3_dt9dg5,1573228043.0,"i have never related to something more in my life, i constantly do this and try and find ways to keep people around by using those attention-seeking behaviors"
BPD,f2d59ge,t1_f2d51ln,1570147264.0,purple! i'm currently waiting to rinse it out so lets see how shit it looks!
BPD,f0xdo08,t3_d70b2p,1569029404.0,"y e s all this yes. and for me, i can't ever accept it and message/bother them over and over again probably making them WANT to actually ignore me!! i'm Tired of it!"
BPD,f0p9cqd,t3_d5td5z,1568829984.0,"right, the second something went wrong i started messaging him again and now it feels like even he is tired of me. more than ever before. big Yikes"
BPD,ez9yp1n,t3_d081ex,1567791910.0,"This happens so often omg, like the SECOND they give me attention i spin it to be romantic and then daydream forever about them"
BPD,eyybq41,t1_eyy6emh,1567579163.0,"omfg i feel the EXACT same way, i'm in college and drink too and the other night i drank with someone i barely knew and told them EVERYTHING. If i hadn't have done that, i wouldn't be so stressed right now."
BPD,eyxder1,t1_eyxbqky,1567550558.0,"I can never tell myself to stop talking in time, it's always me talking before my brain catches up. I'm trying to learn how to do it though, but man am I failing at it"
BPD,eyx2iox,t1_eyx16kx,1567543351.0,"right, like all i can think after is ""why did i do that???"" and it's just something i can't control. even after doing it a thousand times and each time it having the same outcome (usually pushing people away) i STILL do it!"
BPD,exdbf0h,t3_crvrr4,1566172141.0,"I have people surrounding me, two good positive close friends, a (now) pretty ok family, but I really do suffer from just loneliness. It's like no matter how many people I have around I still feel like I am in my own little bubble"
BPD,exdayf1,t3_cs2yic,1566171795.0,"I have this same problem, I am so obsessive over guys that I have even the tiniest of feelings for. The second they show me any attention I catch feelings and I am unable to stop daydreaming and fantasizing about them. But for me the obsession doesn't stop, even if we date and then break up. It takes a long time for it to end, and it's usually set off by one tiny thing and I suddenly hate them and move on. I can never tell if what I am feeling is a normal person crush, or if it's just my brain putting this person above everything and everyone else."
BPD,ep1dvuo,t3_btkf4o,1558987940.0,"I feel you on the ""I need to have someone I'm attracted to that gives me attention,"" I have been struggling with it myself a lot the past two months after a breakup. Something I'm finding that helps is just having sticky notes everywhere with little tips like ""Do not rely on others to validate you"" and ""Give yourself the attention you desire."" I only started doing this a few days ago, but I'm starting to train myself to look at my sticky notes or the phone background I made to help pull me out of it and affirm myself. If you ever need to talk, I'm here!!"
