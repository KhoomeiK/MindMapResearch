EatingDisorders,fdes2b9,t3_ekse8b,1578345423.0,"I do understand , itâ€™s same with my dad ... we (my mom and 2 sisters)really love him but the food thing annoys us and usually ends with arguing . We do compare our portions , body , meals, snacks etc. to his . 
My mom always advice him to eat well and better (specially he smokes and mentioned one time that it helps him regulate his appetite)... but since he always work with good effort and doesnâ€™t tear out we guess it wonâ€™t harm staying away from what he used to deal with since  childhood .

But  itâ€™s about YOU , YOU DO LOVE HIM , nothing is perfect... so stay away from what annoys you , remember  friends and family are eating same as your portions and even way more 
Remember itâ€™s your body , and YOUR body probably has different metabolism twice boosted as your bf so no need ...

Give yourselves time , he could get jealous from  you and heal ... just like my dad who gained weight lately and got in healthy shape ."
