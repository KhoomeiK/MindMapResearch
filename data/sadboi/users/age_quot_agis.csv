the idea of being rich is purely repulsive to me, because everything is connected, so at any point that i would be rich, i have taken more than i need. and usually it's taken away by the ones who need it more. having just enough to live a decent life for me is the most optimal solution, as you don't have first to take smth away and then give it back.  

my ""purpose"" in life is not really a purpose. i'm just a human that isn't much or mainly human-centered, but instead i give a lot of my attention and my thoughts to the beauty and aesthetics of all nature, even the nature of having a brain that creates ideas/inputs that don't make sense to human society.

the older one feels an intense connection towards me. she's a very intelligent, sometimes stubborn woman. sometimes she suffers from fear of failure and in relationships she shows a bit of a clinging behavior. she is like a goddess of justice and we share an interest for forgotten mythologies. she also has this kind of weirdness inside which makes her feel connected to me, but she doesn't have the weirdness as intense as me. because of that she also can feel uncomfortable or not fitting in social situations but she's still a quite social person and absolutely not disordered like me. she's very empathetic towards people, only in close family sometimes stubborn, or dismissive. a book nerd.  

The younger one is the most normal one with no problems in life. she's quite younger, so my mother was already more expirienced in parenting. she appears a bit like a lazy careless person, but if you know her you see that she thinks more intensely and reflective about things than a bigger amound of people in her age, and that can sometimes make her feel a bit frustrated but not that she really suffers. she's still finding out where she belongs due to her young age and sadly she's trying too hard to impress our dad instead of following her path. she pointed out that she feels like she's boring because my older sister and me both have a special skill and she believes that if we were not her sisters she would have turned out dumb and unreflective. my older sister sometimes acted dismissive towards her which made it worse but i think it's gonna be ok. ony she can calm me from an anxiety attack. she works in a mental hospital.  

i don't do much with my sisters but the older one writes me from time to time and i see her rarely when she misses me. the younger sister never writes because she's with friends and stuff but i see her every two weeks because some weekends i go to my parents home on the country side to escape the turbulent city and to be in the forest."

Schizoid,fn5yev4,t1_fn5ur6p,1586680375.0,"I'll try without a guarantee :)  

To me it sounds like an inner emptiness. Most of the time this originated in childhood but not always. There are many different reasons, for example if you were constantly criticized, always had to adapt or had to be different from who you are. Or lack of care/attention from parents/relatives. (and many more reasons ..)  

People suffering from inner emptiness often try different activities in order to feel something again, to feel obliged to something, or to evoke feelings. This – you see it yourself – usually does not work, and depending on the temper some of them will develop addictions, for example gambling addiction or something. (This is probably not the case with you :D )  

**In any case, it is of no use to start any replacement activities that mean nothing to you. Because inner emptiness is split feelings.** So you have to integrate your own feelings again and allow the pain that arises. Pain that is allowed and lived through is pain dealt with. Unfortunately, I don't know how exactly you can integrate your own feelings again. But you cannot find out much about yourself and your own happiness by analyzing others and your surroundings and then trying to transfer these conclusions to yourself.  

If you really want to change something, you also have to be insightful and accept yourself. I know you say you don’t have low self esteem. But just because you feel no inferiority, you can still kind of believe it. For example, whenever you describe yourself as a typical loser. Even if you say it's is just what it is and it doesn’t make you feel inferior.. Please, just realize that dealing with yourself like this is shit, otherwise you won't be able to tackle the problem better.  

Maybe ask r/psychotherapy. There are many psychologists there whose advice you can take for free. They surely can recommend a good book on how you can best meet your inner emptiness. And since you like to read anyway, why not give it a try?  

edit: pity, i just saw they don't give any psychological advice there, but maybe asking for a book recommendation would be ok if you *only want to know more about a topic* ;)"

And cause you don't want these things (whatever it is) you're not giving it to them either, which makes you question if you actually feel entitled to get stuff, not appreciating it, and giving nothing back.  

if that is the case, no, it's not narcissism. it's just a bad situation that can happen to a person with needs that are very niche or just different."
Schizoid,fmfcfui,t3_fuv29l,1586024344.0,"no clue what i am. never talk about my sexuality, i just do what i do. I'm just a person who can be attracted to specific people and it follows no principle, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age usually older than me but if younger usually not younger than 20. i've been attracted to straight men&women, gay men&women, bisexual men&women, trans people, men who only dress like women but are straight (sorry i really dunno about terms) but **can't relate much to the LGBT community / how they represent themselves.**  

there's also no real principle what exactly was attractive for me. some shapes of noses or eyes i like but doesn't matter much. sometimes it was their personality that attracted me, sometimes their appearance, or else. even people that i find physically not so attractive can still attract me in some way.  

it's always gazillions of different things that come together in one person which make this person attractive in the unique way he/she is.  

i just very rarely would want to get in contact with them."
Schizoid,fmem8s4,t3_fuo4ie,1586008144.0,"in the past black always. now i don't have a style but i like always very specific pieces and mix them a bit randomly, sometimes with different patterns and colors & always black leggins and maybe a skirt with it. never ever uncomfy pants. because everything is a bit randomly mixed people would call it hippie like, but it's not really hippie. it's nothing."
Schizoid,fme7zrm,t3_fupvg3,1585993274.0,"can't complain much about quarantine because i enjoy the loneliness. shitty though that i can't go buy any furniture. but at least it makes you creative.

I feel like the older i get (or my parents) the better we tolerate eachother. went for a visit to my rural parents home after several weeks and i just went to the forest with my mother to look for a beautiful tree branch which i'm gonna turn into a nice lamp for my new flat. We went to a place where we buried one of my chicken called Ulrich (Uli) i had tamed during my childhood. ..hm hm. I'm actually young but inside i feel like an old woman, except i know nothing.  

-  

The trainstations are empty. i imagine living in a world with few people and create little stories in my head.  

-  

It's getting warm. whenever it does, i feel like dressing different. i took out an old 90s fleece sweater with a lot of colors.

""forgot"" to take my medication, so i have to go to the drug store and get them because my sleeping problems are coming back and nightly panic. ew."

Schizoid,fmbp94e,t3_fu42ai,1585930705.0,"i think it would come off as rude, so in this rare occasion i usually fake it to not come off as an asshole, but don't fake it too much so they don't ask if you want to have a drink. If they ask stuff about me i sometimes tell them i'll go on holidays soon or i have many things going on, to not give them a chance to feel like they should spend time with me, but still feel like i'm not indifferent. you can also recommend them an exhibition or anything you've recently done to come off as nice, and at the same time they don't ask to go with you cause you've been already. Or you start talking about a novel you've read to politely bore them a bit."

Schizoid,fm5l6mf,t1_fm55fje,1585775008.0,imo you don't become a different person if you learn things / learn to handle life better. but it depends what identity means to you wheter you see it like this or not.
Schizoid,fm3w6kc,t3_fsw5kh,1585739246.0,"nope, but i wonder why so many people think that therapy is about becoming another person. it's not. it's about learning to cope with your problems."

Not true at all. I love to do different things. I just need to be alone to enjoy them. Like painting, reading, exploring my environment, designing stuff, creating smth like dreamcatchers or rattan lampshades or whatever, optimizing things, doing recherches, cinema trips, going to cafes, playing with animals, playing an instrument, visiting thrift shops, finding optimal solutions for other people if they let me do it alone or if no personal blabla is involved. etc..."
Schizoid,flray6f,t3_fqg2qd,1585416551.0,"different things have changed in my life:  

finally moved out of my parents home into a very nice flat together with my partner. sadly it's hard to make it cozy as we can't go buy furniture because of the lockdown.  

my beloved cat died a month ago.. it was 20 years old so i had it for a long time in my life. i hoped it would come back but it was weak so i guess it had withdrawn into the forest to die. i'm looking to adopt a stray cat and i saw one which reminded me a lot of my old cat. i wrote them and they said i could have it. sadly the woman from the organisation forgot to reserve it for me and then someone else of the same organisation gave it away..  

the lockdown has some good sides as well: i applied for another design school for after summer. now i don't have to do the entrance test because everyone with a high grade point average passes. besides that i feel much more relaxed in general. i'm hsp, and working from home is really beneficial for someone like me."

Schizoid,fld8oz5,t3_fo4gn1,1585059243.0,"for me it always depends where the color is used. i guess i'm obsessed with color palettes rather than specific colors.  

just the color itself: my favourites are lilac and green because for me they're the magic colors. but they have to be represented as such in a digital painting for instance.  

but in interior design for instance i'd like brown, offwhite, green, reddish, turqoise  

with hair i love auburn with two blonde streaks  
or blackbrown with dusky pink underneath  
or complete black  
etc..  

In animals i love cats for instance which are golden shaded, ticked or ruddy..  

i also like white, it's fantastic to see a perfectly transparent glass filled with white milk.  

etc..."
Schizoid,fld7g29,t3_fo53cr,1585058404.0,"that's not exactly the case for me. i very often imagine how other people feel and what brought them to act in a particular way etc. i can even be obsessed for a shorter time about one person, character, celeb, author.. and kinda stalk for a while. but without ever wanting to interact with them. usually i understand on a cognitive level why they act how they act, but i don't relate. not to relate is the real reason for me."

Schizoid,fktuzpe,t3_fkmj4h,1584535374.0,yes.. i'm not sure if it's because of hsp. i would need to have zero pressure and absolute freedom to be able to achieve smth meaningful. but that's not possible in this world. i'm working on seeing things not as pressure points but i guess until i achieve that i am old and will die soon.
