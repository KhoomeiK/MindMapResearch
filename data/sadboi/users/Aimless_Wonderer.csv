But to your concerns:

1) A major tenet of canvassing is that it's not about conflict. You don't argue with the people. If they are firmly against Bernie, you thank them for their time and move on. Otherwise, you tell them why you love him, and hope they come around! Either way, you're giving the campaign information.

2) The canvassing lists won't send you to people they know are die-hard Trump fans. They're trying to make contact with undecided voters and people who are likely to get their ballots in for Bernie. Talking to people ""on the other team"" would be a waste of our time. Of course, there are errors, but they're a tiny minority of the time."

Not that that makes it better or worse, but you should be really proud of your skills! 😊

2) Drawing is banned so you can study more? Does she not realize that art is incredible for your brain? And for your general well-being, and motivation to do everything else you're doing?
I work at a children's theatre, and I wish your mom could see everything my students, many of whom will never go into theatre, get out of participating in an art form they love. It's an incredible piece of life, and she shouldn't get to take that away from you 

3) More importantly, you're 21? Why does she have any say over what you do? (Especially something as benign and positive as drawing?) She has no right to tell you what you can and can't do at this point in your life.

I just want you to know that it is seriously unreasonable of her to demand this. I would ask yourself what leverage she thinks she has over you to control your actions. I thought for a long time that I had to ask my mom for permission to do things, just because she maintained that expectation and I didn't want to disappoint her. Eventually I realized she was holding me back, and I didn't have to ask her permission. I slowly was able to do a lot more. 

I would advise removing as many ties as possible that she can hold over you as leverage. Doesn't mean you have to cut relationship ties...just ones that make you rely on her. I've moved out, but I'm in that process right now with some remaining ties...phone bill and car insurance.

You seem like a nice and surprisingly upbeat person from the tone of your replies. Props to you for keeping your head up! But don't let that get in the way of standing up for what you need and deserve. She does not get to tell you what you can and can't do just because she is your mom. Being your mom does not give her that right. You deserve to have control over your actions and choice in your life. You deserve that simply by virtue of being a human. So remember that, and go and be awesome in the world. :D"
