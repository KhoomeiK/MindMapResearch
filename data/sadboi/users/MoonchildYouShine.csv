depression,fqj1sb9,t3_gj2v91,1589403877.0,"That's great, I don't know you but I'm proud. I feel like when you find other people dealing with depression you are just rooting for them even if you don't know them. I'm 21 now but I was thinking about going back to college. I dropped out 2 years ago because I had depression and anxiety also the work made me stressed and I was really suicidal. I'm still having a hard time I just got out of a 2 week depressive episode. I wanted to finish and I was afraid to leave because I didn't want to disappoint my mom, but I barely made it through high school I have been dealing with mental health disorders for 7 years. So now I'm trying to get myself together and get a job so I can save some money for things I want to do. Also I feel like once I can regain control of my life I will probably go back to college but it will be online. I have always wanted to do different things each day so I can experience the things in life that I was afraid to do because of depression. Congratulationsüòä‚ù§üéâ"
SuicideWatch,fp7860t,t1_fp7717h,1588365797.0,"Yeah, I don't like posting online sometimes either because I just feel like it won't help. I just mostly post online because it's easier to talk to people online. They don't know who I am so I can talk and not have to worry about hurting their feelings because I'm not talking about them. I just wish I could get myself together and be better. I am trying to find a job but for the past 2 days everytime I look I just get sad because I don't have a degree and the things you don't need a degree for take forever to get to a point where you're making decent money."
SuicideWatch,fp6czjt,t1_fp6bneg,1588350216.0,I tried to eat better before and it doesn't help I just end up hating myself for being fat and I stop eating. I also have to starve till I find a job because I can't afford to contribute to my household so I can't eat anything in here. I've never heard of what you are talking about. I just think nothing happens so I think I'm ok. I don't feel comfortable telling anyone because they will think I'm stupid and judge me. Then that will just stop me completely from trying to get better. I'm hopeless enough as it is. I don't want anyone to make it worse.
SuicideWatch,fp68jt6,t1_fp61z37,1588348003.0,"Thank you for responding, I must be ok because I'm still fat. I don't look unwell and I don't have an eating disorder. I have been like this for years but nothing happens. I haven't eaten for almost 2 days, my mom doesn't know that I force myself not to eat. I can just tell her I'm not hungry and she'll believe it. I don't feel comfortable using weed and I don't think I'm allowed where I live."
depression,fow0csj,t3_g9w1ed,1588110700.0,"Too Sad To Cry- Sasha Sloan is a good song
My music tastes are all over the place. I listen to Eminem mostly his old stuff but his new music is good as well. I listen to Kpop alot mostly Bts, some people might think it's stupid but when I read the lyrics I realize that I relate a lot to Bts. They have insecurities and mental illnesses as well, they really make my days better. I also listen to Cyndi Lauper I'm 21 but the 80s has some really good music. I can go on and on about the music I like but I will stop right here. I forgot Twenty One Pilots are really good I love their music Tyler talks about his struggles with mental health in the songs they put out so basically you can find a song from them that relates to you."
SuicideWatch,fomu6ln,t1_fomlyfw,1587903945.0,I can never seem to bring myself to do anything when I wake up then the day is over and I'm upset that I didn't do anything. I really like quarantine as well but I don't like where I am living. I will try to do something but that doesn't solve much of my problems thank you for commenting. I honestly didn't expect anyone to read my post.
depression,fnx087w,t1_fnwzvf7,1587328928.0,"No problem, I hope you feel better. You seem like a nice person. When it's time the person who becomes your girlfriend will be very lucky."
depression,fnwzaew,t3_g48ycp,1587328395.0,"I make up fantasies as well. I always think about how I would meet the person I will marry. I have never had a boyfriend though. Sometimes I think I want one so I can finally find someone to love me and check up on me. Then I realized that I'm inexperienced, so I get scared to try to meet guys because I feel like they will be more experienced than me. Which they most likely will because I've never kissed a guy either so I feel kind of pathetic. I'm such an introvert and I have social anxiety so I can't even stand in a train station without feeling uncomfortable so I just feel like I'm bound to be alone. I also want to be able to love myself first and make changes in my life to make me more confident. I just have so far to go and I always find myself quitting. This was long but I just felt the need to comment because I kind of relate."
depression,fn7110l,t3_fzov76,1586711207.0,My mom has actually said this to me and it really sucks. That is the reason why I've stopped talking to her about my problems. She says that I can talk to her but then says the main thing that you are not supposed to say to someone who's depressed. I felt like she just lied to me. I mean we talk and we get along for the most part when she's not getting mad at me for no reason or getting upset with me because I stay in my room all day and I don't talk to anyone. Still I can't really confide in her anymore I made that mistake before thinking she understood then she proved me wrong. It sucks that you guys are going through this as well. I didn't mean to rant but I just related so much to this.
SuicideWatch,fmjs9dl,t1_fmjr4n1,1586136679.0,Thank you I appreciate it. I just need to die and everything will be better. I don't have a way yet but I will get one.

SuicideWatch,flo39ik,t1_flo1ock,1585330812.0,"I will try but I'm not promising anything. If I eat, then I eat. If I don't then oh well like I said eating is not important to me right now. I have to be comfortable otherwise I can't really eat. So, sorry if that's not what you wanted to hear. I'm weak I can't face the problem so it's better to try to avoid it as much as I can."
SuicideWatch,flnwl7c,t1_flnv4ka,1585327251.0,"Thank you, I'm not allowed to eat in my room. I usually try to sneak food in there but I can't do it till it's nighttime so when I do eat even if it's one time I usually wait till it gets dark. I don't want to leave my room. I can hear them out there and I just feel uncomfortable just thinking about going into the kitchen. I can hold out I've done this before since I barely eat when I'm depressed. So I can wait all day if I have to and I do."
depression,flnris2,t3_fpvfb6,1585324493.0,I'm having a hard time as well so I understand. I'm a great listener the only compliment I can 100% give myself so message me anytime. We can be friends.
SuicideWatch,f2bjgw2,t1_f2bgpb0,1570127245.0,"I don't need to be saved, I am not worth saving. I won't end my life today. I can't, I don't have a way to kill myself yet. Please don't feel like you have to help me. You seem like a nice person I want to warn you, I am really stubborn. I might not listen. I am fine for now, I won't be fine forever if I'm gonna be honest but I'll be fine now. Thank you, I really appreciate you giving your time."
SuicideWatch,f2bbjbd,t1_f2bauaq,1570124289.0,"No thank you, I have already decided what I am gonna do. I thought that maybe I could live in this world but, I was lying to myself. I don't want to bring you down. Don't waste your time, please help someone who is acually going to do better."
depression,ex9f40a,t1_ex9ehrl,1566087888.0,Yeah me too. I always find myself thinking about how much better I would be doing if I wasn't depressed.
depression,ex9e5zk,t1_ex9dfjm,1566087503.0,"Yeah, thank you it's nice to find someone who understands my family has no clue what it's like. I wish you wellüëç"
depression,ex9d3jh,t1_ex9ckfw,1566087066.0,"Wow, I'm sorry. Yeah I hate being stuck at home and doing nothing my job is the only thing that gets me out of the house. I sometimes stay at my job after I clock out just so I don't have to be home with my thoughts."
depression,evrsmes,t1_evrs458,1564717262.0,Thank you
depression,evroxde,t1_evromc3,1564714194.0,"Yes, I hope so too. I wish you the best and I hope you get everything you want in life if you know what that is and if you don't I hope you figure it out. God knows I need to. Goodnight if it is night for you I don't know where you are but you never know with the time differences in the world."
depression,evrn8sa,t3_cktt5m,1564712863.0,"Yes, I get like this last month for 3 weeks. I barely ate anything. My mom told me I looked like I was losing weight. I didn't notice this so I had trouble believing her. When I am depressed I don't feel like eating and also I don't want to eat because I've gained alot of weight after high school. I mean I thought I was fat in high school. It's worse now. I've stopped eating before but I decided to stop eating again during that time I was having my depressive episode. Because this voice in my head was telling me you're fat and ugly. You need to lose weight and I hate the gym and lack motivation. So I thought not eating was the best way and since I was really depressed I didn't care about food."
depression,evrmb1v,t1_evrli7a,1564712133.0,"I know, I wish I had friends who understood what it's like. I wish my family understood what it's like. It's so hard to deal with and you just sit in a corner and cry and you want to just be happy and secure in life and not feel like a failure all the time. Also at the same time I don't want them to have to suffer and deal with what I'm dealing with."
depression,evrlavz,t1_evrjpaw,1564711358.0,"I wanna cry because of how much I relate to this. I am hard on myself constantly. I'm even more hard on myself during an episode if that's even possible. Whatever good I do I can never think of it when I am asked. If my therapist says ""You must have done something right."" After I've told her I am always messing up. I can't think of anything."
depression,evquqzz,t1_evqti3n,1564697641.0,"Yeah I broke down and cried. I was like I want to answer your questions but all that is coming out is ""I don't know."" I was so mad at myself because I was like ""You're not gonna get any help if you sit there and be silent, speak."" But my mouth was not cooperating. I get what you mean all those questions that you feel that she doesn't need to ask especially for me because I am doing bad in almost all aspects of my life especially school."
depression,evqrfbz,t3_ckmvf8,1564696326.0,"I get like this alot. I recently had a depressive episode that lasted for 3 almost 4 weeks and I got a new therapist. My first meeting with her she asked me questions and I sat there saying ""I don't know"" because that was all that came out. In my head I was answering her questions but when I opened my mouth the answers didn't come out. Also this happened when I went through that process that you have to explain why you are here. I couldn't say ""I'm depressed and I was crying everyday and I thought about suicide everyday."" Instead I said ""My mom said I should come here."" I mean it was true my mom did say I should go see a new therapist since I didn't have one at the moment but I couldn't say anything else when they continued to ask me why was I there. It was annoying and frustrating"
SuicideWatch,epp1e7d,t1_epp0vok,1559360397.0,There is no point when you need a college degree to live comfortably and not have to rely on your mom and I have zero motivation to do anything and no one else in my immediate family that I even talk to is fat so they can't even help me lose the weight cause they don't need to.
depression,eoluag4,t3_bsd08u,1558676435.0,"I get what you mean, I always want to help other people. I think I care about everybody else in the world more than I care about myself. Sometimes I feel like I don't deseve to be here either. I hope you both are able to overcome this. You guys seem like very nice people. I hope you get everything you want and deserve in life."
