Check outside shelters as that is where people are likely going to be dropped off. File a missing persons report asap so if he is found and hospitalized you will be let known.
schizophrenia,fn8293f,t3_g0699m,1586732382.0,"When I had my first episode I thought the world was ending, gave all of my savings away to the homeless, slept outside a bus station, conned my way into 700$ of foreign currency, got in a fight with another homeless man, and hitch hiked 400 miles to live in a barn on an abandoned blueberry farm. My second episode went much worse. If you have schizophrenia it is very, very light and don't worry too much. If you are recommended to take the meds take the meds. I have severe, treatment resistant schizophrenia and I work part time, go to school full time for a stem degree with a near perfect gpa, and I have a loving partner. It is not the end of your life. However, it can get more severe so it is better to take the meds early and prevent a bad episode than to wait and see and almost ruin your life like I did. Hope this helps"

Ultimately I want freedoms in my career. I also have a disability that sometimes requires extended hospitalization and that is ultimately why I want contract work so I can work when able and take off when needed.
