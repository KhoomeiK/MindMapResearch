I also have access to marijuana where I am, and that helped so much when I was tapering off. I know some people have worse anxiety with weed, but it seems to help me. Overall I could function. I did feel a little off and sort of uncomfortable. The worst symptom I had was nausea. That was pretty bad sometimes, otherwise I’d say I felt much worse while tapering off Effexor."

Agoraphobia,fr1yl8t,t3_gm4wd2,1589828132.0,"I’ve tried so many antidepressants. Everyone is different so it’s hard to say which will work best for you. Sometimes it’s a trial and error process. It is possible to do a genetic test that is able to determine what the best medicine for you. I’ve never done it, but I want to! I’m currently on Zoloft. It doesn’t do much for me. I’ve taken lexapro which also didn’t do much. Effexor (SNRI) worked the best for me, but it made my hair fall out, and it was horrible to go off of. Worse than going off 1.5mgs of klonopin. I took Pristiq (SNRI) for a long time. It helped at first but then stopped working. I also take Wellbutrin, and that one helps give a little boost. Not enough for me unfortunately but it’s also worth trying because if you’re like me with your agoraphobia, you’re not just anxious to leave the house, but unmotivated to do so. Wellbutrin can help with that. I still take klonopin occasionally for panic attacks. I also take Vistaril and that helps some with anxiety/panic attacks. As you can see, finding the right medicine can be complicated lol. Zoloft is definitely a good one to start with. Good luck! I hope you find some relief."

I find this subreddit to be kind of a negative place overall with lots of downvoting and people judging whether or not you should have a service dog. I agree that it’s frustrating to have people getting fake certificates and having ESAs that they truly don’t need, but you can’t really determine whether or not someone’s condition requires a service dog over Reddit. I also have a PSD that my many mental health doctors told me to get. I’ve tried many treatments, but I need a little bit of help that the dog can provide. You can’t see my illness so maybe it looks like I’m fine, but I’m not. It sucks that regular people out there judge others for having service dogs, let alone other service dog handlers.

I don’t really have too much anxiety about handling the dog in public and what other people say, it’s more posts like these that give me the anxiety. I know that a lot of people seem to be getting them, but please also don’t just assume that those of us with psychiatric needs are getting a dog just because. That’s not true at all. I am also quite experienced as a dog owner, and I know what I’m doing. The last thing I want when I go in public with my dog that is trained for various things is to be judged by not just those ignorant people out there, but other service dog handlers as well.

With a shelter dog, you don’t really know what you’re getting or what that dog has been through whether it be purebred or a mutt. I love animals so I will continue to adopt and eventually foster for the rest of my life, but I see no issue with buying from a good, reputable breeder. 

Neither of my adopted dogs can be trained as a service dog for me because they are both older now, and have too much anxiety. Despite our best efforts to socialize them, they are terrified of public spaces other than their walk route. I did a lot of research, and found a lovely breeder who I know takes excellent care of her dogs, and bought a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel from her. They make great emotional support, and/or service dogs because they are very loving and want to please which makes them easy to train. They are also small which makes travel easier. I’m not exactly proud of the fact that I bought this dog, but I don’t feel too bad either. I know he was loved and cared for before he came into my home, and he’s a clean slate with no past traumas. He probably won’t be the last dog that I get from a good breeder either. My beloved Australian Shepherd passed away a year ago, and someday I plan to find a good breeder so I can be an Aussie mom again.

When he chews or bites you yell “ouch” I’ve noticed that learning not to bite is a little bit harder for huskies. Finally, embrace some temper tantrums. They will continue to happen. I used to take care of a husky that would literally argue with me lol. They are a very talkative breed and have a lot of personality. Don’t accept bad behavior like biting/ aggression. As soon as the dog does those things, ignore him. If you need to, kennel him. Give him treats in the kennel so that he doesn’t associate it with punishment."
CPTSD,fqbldgd,t3_ghuy0w,1589239156.0,"I’ve definitely noticed that on Modern Family. Admittedly, I do find the show funny at times, but there is definitely a lot of abuse going on in each little family. Everyone is always telling Haley that she is stupid. Everyone ignores Alex, and Luke is given a pass for a lot of things. Jay constantly insults Gloria for her trouble with English, Manny for his more dressy style, and his own children. Specifically Mitchell. Of course Cam and Mitch have a toxic relationship and are always trying to one up the other for laughs. 

Another show that comes to mind for me is Gilmore Girls. I loved that show growing up, but I’ve rewatched it more over the years, and find that it sort of gives narcissistic mothers a pass. The main character Lorelai is forced to reactivate a relationship with her parents in order to pay for her daughter’s school. Over the course of the show you see Lorelai constantly being belittled and talked down to by her mother. The message is that Lorelai should forgive her mother. On the other side, Lorelai has an extremely unhealthy relationship with her daughter Rory. She had Rory when she was 16 and the two have more of a best friends kind of relationship rather than mother/daughter relationship. Rory has to constantly carry the burden of her mother’s emotional turmoil while also frequently having to extinguish arguments between her mother and grandmother. Rory grows up to be kind of helpless because she never has a chance to be a child because her mother constantly pressures her to be perfect. It’s hard to watch at times."

Second, my CPTSD has made me agoraphobic, so I barely talk to anyone a majority of the time. When my husband gets home the floodgates open. I think it’s a loneliness thing. Third, I was also ranted to a lot as a kid. I was my mother’s therapist. I’ve seemed to attract a lot of friends who also rant to me. I am sort of the bearer of a lot of other people’s pain, and that’s a lot to deal with. Most of these people rely on me for emotional support, but don’t always listen in return.

They told me that I didn’t have enough “spirit” (whatever that means), and criticized me for being quiet and timid without ever trying to understand the route of the problem. Worst of all, I was sexually abused by my pediatrician WHILE my mother was there. She even helped hold me down. I have a good therapist now, but my first one who I adored just up and left the practice. Life happens I guess, but I lost my trust in therapists after that. My first psychiatrist was basically just a pill pusher who kept telling me that one day I would have kids, and then they’d come first and I’d have to go off my medicine. I don’t want kids.

I always feel like I’m not doing enough and not helping enough which makes me feel guilty. I feel emotions to extreme levels. Most of the time sadness is what I feel. When I love someone, it’s a super strong feeling. Like I would do anything for them. I have to keep myself in check and try to think of myself sometimes otherwise I burn out and become too exhausted to do anything. I deeply care about other people and all living beings. I see each person as individual with their own internal world. I have to force myself to put myself first. It is very hard for me to do that. 

In my experience, I am not horrified by people with ASPD who haven’t committed violent crimes. Like I said before, I see value in all people. I am definitely disgusted by murders, child abusers, rapists, and etc. I want justice for those victims, and I want to see the perpetrators of those crimes punished for their actions. I find their behavior disgusting, but part of my also feels bad for them because as an empath, I can’t help but feel sorry for them. Now you don’t describe yourself as being violent, and you haven’t done anything bad to me personally, so I have no reason to be horrified by you.

Try to build a support system before he goes of either friends, family if you’re on good terms, and having a therapist to talk to every week helps.

I have been struggling with this same thing. Am I horrible for not reaching out to my parents during a global pandemic? I actually asked my therapist this question, and she told me that the pandemic doesn’t change things. She reminded me that my parents could literally die today in a car accident. Life and the future is uncertain no matter what’s going on in the world. Does that mean I should reach out to my parents?  No. They don’t deserve it. They lost their privileges of me being there for them when they abused me throughout my life and as recently as last summer. Something that helps me is to focus on their wrongdoings. When I start to feel guilty or like I miss my parents, I think back to different scenarios when they were horrible to me. And there’s many to choose from.

CPTSD,fly1tfk,t3_frse73,1585593979.0,"Can you see a new doctor? I get that xanax can be addictive and all. I was on Klonopin daily for like 2 years. Now I have a new doctor who won’t prescribe me klonopin for the daily use, but she understands the importance of me having a few on hand for panic attacks. A lot of doctors don’t want to prescribe benzos because of the risk of abuse, but if your doctor gives you a limited amount of .25mg pills, I honestly don’t see the problem. It’s not the same as abusing it like you stated it. Sometimes just knowing that I have the klonopin helps my panic attacks to go away without even taking it. My doctor understands this, and it seems like you need to find someone new. Drugs like Xanax are necessary for certain patients. Not everyone is trying to abuse them! I’m sorry your doctor wouldn’t give you that. Definitely see if you can find someone new. In the meantime take care of yourself and go easy on yourself!

It’s sad really because she was capable of so much more, but instead she goes along with it all. She’s not a child anymore. She’s an adult, and she should know that the way she treats me is wrong. She should know that ganging up on me is wrong. But she doesn’t. She is definitely overly enmeshed with my parents, and while that’s sad, she has also become them. I’m pretty sure she’s on her way to becoming a narcissist herself if she’s not already. On a more positive note, my brother has been in my corner ever since I went NC with my parents. He was complicit in some of the abuse that I endured as the scapegoat, but now as an adult he sees that my parents are fucked up people.

In that moment when the reporter questioned him, he probably became angry because he wants to be the one being comforted instead of comforting the American people. He wants the reporter to ask him questions about him and how he’s doing. It’s all about him. And because he’s getting caught in this web of lies, you can seem him unraveling, and when a narcissist unravels, it’s scary. And regardless of whether or not he has Alzheimer’s or NPD, there’s no excuse for his comments and his behavior."

This coronavirus definitely poses more of a risk than just physical health. People’s mental health will also be affected, and what about those of us who were already struggling before this all happened? We are at a high risk and I wish people would stop joking about it and try to be there for each other."

Not only is klonopin addictive, but also not going to help your symptoms in the long term. It’s only meant for situations like you are talking about. When I got off the klonopin, it was miserable but the one thing that helped the withdrawal symptoms was marijuana. The marijuana also helped me to get off the klonopin quicker because I replaced klonopin with marijuana. Anytime someone suggests that the marijuana is the source of my issues, I want to roll my eyes. Like you I believe the science of course, but I also know myself and my body and would recommend medical marijuana over klonopin and other benzos 10/10 times. Good for you for standing up for yourself!"

If Sookie slipped some meat into my meal to try to get me to taste how good her food was, I would be devastated honestly. And it’s been so long since I’ve had meat that it would probably make me sick too! Sookie and Lorelai are definitely backwards on a lot of things.

The funny this is that even though I look more like her than my siblings, she always claimed that I look the least like her. I’m not one hundred percent sure why that is, but I was her scapegoat, so she just had it out for me. When I look at myself in the mirror or see pictures of myself, I get into a state of dissociation where the person starting back at me isn’t me, or the person in the picture isn’t me. Accepting that I look so much like her is hard for some reason, and in order to cope with it, my mind tries to tell me that I’m not me and therefore I have nothing to do with my mom. I’m NC with both parents, and I’ve been grieving and feeling sad about the loss of my hope that my parents would change. Seeing myself in the mirror and recognizing so much of my mother is a difficult pill to swallow. Most daughters are happy to look like their mothers, but she took that from me too."

I definitely see others being unkind. Recently, I was leaving the psychiatrist, and another patient wasn’t too far behind me. The parking spots at the office are small, and I was parked close to her through no choice of my own. She saw I had parked close and starting yelling at me and just being rude. I was very upset by this because my appointment had been rough. Like I know she has depression or mental illness too, but it’s not my fault that the spots are small! I feel like having depression should make people more compassionate because they know what it’s like to suffer, but in this woman’s case she took out her frustration on me, and it did not feel good.

Depression is a disease that can come for you regardless of who you are. Telling a depressed person to “choose happiness” is like telling a diabetic to “choose to be healthy.” It’s out of our control. The only thing we can do is seek treatment. Sometimes the treatment works, and sometimes it’s a daily fight to function let alone feel happiness. If I could snap my fingers and be happy, I would. Who wouldn’t?"

EstrangedAdultChild,fk1ceqt,t3_ffw958,1583776820.0,"Growing up, I came from a seemingly privileged middle class family. My parents struggled financially, but made sure to keep up appearances to the outside world. They sent me and my siblings to private school, and paid for me to take dance classes. Behind closed doors, all of this “privilege” was constantly thrown in my face by my parents as an excuse to mistreat me. If my mom called me fat or told me I was a bitch, it was okay because she paid for me and made sacrifices. My dad would do things like fill my car with gas, or clean my room. That may seem nice, but he did it all so that he could maintain control. Behind closed doors I was abused emotionally and physically. I was the family scapegoat. 

Now, as an adult, I am married and my husband makes a decent living. I have a Master’s and I also work myself. My husband is great, and to the outside world my life seems great. Even though I’m no longer in that house with my abusive family, I’m feeling the repercussions now. I am severely depressed, have CPTSD, anxiety, and more PTSD from my friend’s sudden death a few years ago. When people find out about my mental illnesses, one of the first things I hear is “but your life is so great!” Or “at least you don’t have to worry about money.” The people who say those things aren’t trying to put me down like my family, but they don’t realize how they invalidate me. When they say that stuff I often think “they are right. It could have been so much worse. I’m a piece of shit for feeling this way when other people have so much less.” I know those thoughts aren’t helpful, but I’m always struggling with the guilt of having a privileged life while struggling. It’s like I don’t deserve to feel sorry for myself or to be sad because I shouldn’t be or something. I’m trying to learn that even though it could be worse, it’s still pretty bad. The way I feel is horrible, and money doesn’t make me feel happier."

I don’t necessarily know how to get rid of it myself. When it’s really bad, I have a very strong desire to cut or scratch myself which isn’t healthy.

CPTSD,fjeghjr,t3_fcveia,1583271234.0,"I struggle with this concept too. I can’t really even imagine my child self, and when I see pictures of me back then, it doesn’t feel like me. It feels like someone else. Something that has helped me have more empathy for myself is not trying to connect to my child self, but to imagine my parents speaking to one of my students the way they spoke to me. That helps me to see that what they did wasn’t right. My students are young children. Maybe you could start there? Like next time you cross paths with a child, think of the rage you would feel if someone hurt someone so innocent. Spending a lot of time with kids as a teacher has really allowed me to get into their minds, and I’ve come to realize how innocent and impressionable kids are. Even the ones who misbehave are innocent. I’m still working on reparenting stuff and wrapping my head around that, but maybe this could be a place to start."
CPTSD,fjeecxw,t3_fctqe3,1583270335.0,"I’ve been on both sides of this. I’ve been the one that people avoided because of my mental health, and I’ve also had to distance myself from friends who were emotionally draining. Maybe your friends aren’t true friends, and I’m sorry that you feel abandoned by them. My friends who couldn’t handle me were either struggling wit their own troubles, or they weren’t true friends that were ever really there for me. I’m currently in a situation where my friend is bad for my mental health. He’s not a bad friend or a bad person, but I am not equipped to help him in the way he needs to be helped. I have many mental health issues myself, and sometimes he unloads his on to me without giving back. Now, I’m not saying that this is what you are doing. It’s just an example. It’s important to have give and take in friendships. If they are only taking, then you may be better off without that toxicity. If you are depending on them too much as if they were a therapist, then that’s something to also recognize. Either way, you deserve friends who will love and support you no matter what."

CPTSD,fj8wlts,t3_fc0it3,1583124268.0,"I am in a similar place right now. I am in the process of grieving the hope for a mother that I will never get. Everything triggers me.

Without her I don’t know what my purpose is. I wish I had more advice to give as I’m where you are. I hope that in time we can heal.

I feel so much older than even someone a year or two younger than me, but at the same time I feel like less of an adult than my peers. It is something I have just begun realizing and I’m trying to sort out myself. One of the things my therapist mentioned was re-parenting, so I’m trying to figure that out. I totally get what you mean when you feel jealous of the college kids and old crotchety. My CPTSD has also caused Major Depression for me so I am a slow mover and a bit of a shut in. I miss being young and carefree, but at the same time I feel like a child who needs to be comforted and loved. It’s very complicated for sure."

If Lorelai had been driving, she would also have “made sure she was okay” when it came to Rory. She’s just way out of line in this whole episode. And the ones that follow too. It’s almost like she uses the accident to prove her point that Jess is a bad kid, when in reality the accident demonstrates that his first priority was Rory.

I also hated the whole “30 something gang.” Amy was making fun of millennials there, and I thought that was rude of her considering millennials make up a large portion of her audience. 30 something millennials may still live at home because it’s hard to get a job and because the cost of living is so high. She made it seem like they were a bunch of delicate, creepy losers. There were other jokes that picked fun at fat people too which put a bad taste in my mouth. On top of it all, the Luke and Lorelai drama was frustrating. All of us waited for them to get together and be happy, but Amy always has to conjure up some stupid drama between them.
