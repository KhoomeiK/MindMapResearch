Jane felt so much pressure growing up, whether it was self imposed or from her grandmother so she is unclear about what is a healthy amount of discipline and what is too much. He is also mentioned to have ADHD and I've known a wide range of people with ADHD and he is honestly a pretty good depiction of a representation of ADHD and better than other severities."
mentalhealth,fqw9sa7,t3_gl4zre,1589697054.0,There's a youtuber called Claudia Boleyn who is in her 20s and has and talks a lot about BPD.

I've found that watching youtube or TV where people talk about their experiences with the same mental health issues as me to be incredibly moving and helpful to me.
gallifrey,fqu6fu4,t3_gkxfzl,1589652936.0,"Davros is definitely more harmful and dangerous but in a way, the Master is more challenging in a lot of situations. The Master's plans are not always the hardest to fight against but they cause far more of a challenge to the Doctor psychologically. Many times, the Master could get the Doctor to question themselves and their own identity. Also every time the Doctor has to fight the Master he also has to balance trying to win them over and stop them from completing their devious plan. So in my mind, the Master is more present as a nemesis than Davros."

When I first watched his episodes I was so incredibly struck by how much he felt like dozens of guys I went to school with, the same manerisms, naivety, monotone voice. He feels like a living breathing young person that I know well. It does feel like he is just being himself but thats not the mark of a bad actor, its more that the role is close enough to his personality that he can be himself. Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate in later episodes is a good example of an actress acting like they would in real life and still turning in a good performance."
adhd_anxiety,fqk4z47,t3_giz85z,1589420261.0,"I have a lot of similar thoughts and the best way that I've figured out how to deal with this is by fully accepting that comparison is not only bad for you, but its also impossible. Comparing yourself to a ""normal"" person and their timeline rests on either the assumption that their is a set timeline or that you are similar to them enough to compare. Everyone does have a different timeline, people have kids at 18 or 38, some go to college and some don't, even people could die young or at 90. Essentially there is no normal timeline because most people's lives are too different even if those in your peer groups have a similar timeline at the moment it could definitely go different ways as they do different things in life. 

TLDR: Its easier to stop comparing yourself to a standard if you recognize that their is no standard."

I do get though how she could be frustrating, I sort of hated her in season 1 with her constant lashing out at Toby. But as that started to reduce and more of her empathy and love for her brothers was shown than I couldn't help but love her.

AskVegans,fpopzyg,t3_geetkv,1588788670.0,I have a mixed opinion about this because largely I do not want people to support an enormous company like this with questionable labor laws and which is a big part of the meat packing industry. However I do think that if people show interest in their vegan options that it might set a good precedent of popularizing vegan options in other large chains as well as smaller restaurants. If the popularization is successful then we might have a net increase of people choosing the plant-based option over the meat option which could improve a large portion of the meat-eating population's health. It could also assist in easing new vegans into a sustainable vegan diet because a large factor for why new vegans have trouble in maintaining their diet is the increase in socializing difficulty when it becomes a harder to go to the same restaurants as their friends.

GilmoreGirls,fovfgui,t3_g9mosy,1588100424.0,"For me this is an example of the writers backing up their story plans with dialogue foreshadowing rather than behavior foreshadowing. The dysfunctional relationship part is very in Rory's character but her difficulty with her career in the revival didn't really gel with what we already knew of her. It is true that when Mitchum met her, she was easily fazed and discouraged by the opinions of other people but we saw her push past it and grow after her year off and terrible decisions during that year off. She went back to school, fought hard, and tried to make decisions such as originally turning down Logan's proposal for her own benefit and without putting other's opinions first. Her weak grip on herself was the weakness that Mitchum saw but her organization abilities, practicality, and work ethic was still intact when he made that comment and throughout the show. Her failings in the revival as a 32 year old showed a complete lack of work ethic with her lack of professionalism in falling asleep while working or sleeping with a source  and a lack of organization and consistency rather than being easily swayed by the opinions of others and a weak sense of self. 

TLDR Mitchum made his comment on a failing that was not the source of her problems in the revival and we saw her learn and grow past it. Making his comment not actually accurate to the character or Rory's journey but rather clearly emblematic of the writer's goals regardless of character consistency."

I've been trying to recreate a library like setting at home by designating a specific part of my room that is *only* for homework so my brain starts to only associate it with work. Sometimes I'll even go outside especially if its chilly to remind my brain that this is working time and it helps my concentration. I occasionally try to mimic my embarrassment about not doing homework in front of people in a cafe ie playing a game so I'll sometimes sit with my family if they're doing those things and tell them that I'm working so that I would be less inclined to do other things.

Their perceived homogeny is really a failing of the writing that does not seem to prioritize their individual characteristics because even though they are all confused earthlings, they should from the little we know about them, have completely different reactions to each alien thing. Occasionally the writing does highlight that with Ryan wanting to shoot the aliens in the ghost monument, Graham being reluctant to actively go towards danger, and the rare sight of Yaz reacting with excitement at the adventure. Our problem is not that they are too similar but more that their differences are not accurately addressed in the subtle ways that they could."

On the note of getting things done take a few minutes of quiet and fully address in your head each task. It has the benefit of going against the avoidance by exposing you to the problem but it might feel easier than actually doing it. Also write down all of your personal values that correspond with each task such as friendship for hanging out with the friend  so that you're motivated by something strong that isn't anxiety or guilt based."

The best advice that I can give is to build a routine at home while the world deals with the coronavirus. Have your own time for your favorite shows, for working out and for talking to the healthily supportive people in your life. Maybe it would be helpful to develop a strict schedule with alarms for your meals to keep your eating regulated. 

Also don't give up hope, there's many colleges where you could get massive scholarships for high ACT scores and many with good financial aid. If the worse happens with your family financials, you still have a lot of options for getting a good education away from the harmful figures in your life.

Yaz and Ryan felt honestly more like real people who actually experienced the jobs that they had and drew perspectives from them. But the ending and the sympathizing with the corporation was so incredibly incongruent with the common values of this show. Rather than encourage a questioning of the system, it mentioned the valid problems of the working class in the system and never does anything to address it afterwards just gives lip service to paid two weeks of sick leave and a higher real person employment rate and called it a day."
gallifrey,fko0c81,t3_fjeprv,1584377585.0,"Honestly I think that whether you like or dislike this episode is based on what you value, characters or plot. The characters in this are fantastic with the doctor benefiting from a chance to slow down and show us more of his genuine kindness in a more domestic setting rather than the usual life-or death setting ie cleaning Craig's house. Craig is also incredibly relatable as just a guy who loves his family and feels a little overwhelmed and down on himself. The interactions between the Doctor, Craig, and Stormageddon create so many beautiful moments and shines a light on the best parts of both of our main characters.

If your a plot person then yes the full conversion being reversed by the power of love was ridiculous and it degrades the power of the cybermen. It probably wouldv'e made more sense to use a new villain instead but what can you do. 

Yeah it depends on what you care about and whether the good outweighs the bad for you."

Its an incredible what if that could propel a story and which makes the master such a fantastic character. They do horrible things but for some reason they seem to care about our heroic protagonist... and shockingly our heroic protagonist cares about them as well.

That reduces my chance of being overwhelmed by a million."
adhd_anxiety,fhxoeu1,t3_f59ibm,1581958848.0,"In my experience, planning the steps to be small and gradual never works out because they lack enough novelty and learning for my ADHD brain to latch on to and no matter my best efforts they tended to have flopped. 

What has worked for me is that I make the small changes a little bit larger like working out for an hour each day rather than incrementally escalating it and keeping it mostly consistent while also allowing for the acceptance that it won't always be fully accomplished and that a little at a time is enough. So in the end I do end up making small changes incrementally with my tapping out of working out done earlier at the beginning. I would tap out after 10min the first day and escalated to an hour by the end of the second week. 

It's the different mentality where I offer my brain more to chew on even if I don't completely follow through with the whole thing. With the exercising example I wasn't adding a small inconsequential push up added each day to my daily routine but it was the idea that I was trying to get into doing something pretty alien and exciting for an amount of time even if it does end up only being a couple of push ups."

TheAmericans,fhrfmz1,t3_f3wiqq,1581824993.0,"My headcannon is that Paige manages to get through questioning despite having weak alibis. It is possible because if I know anything about Elizabeth, I know that she would have well prepared Paige's alibis and answers when put under interview. If so, then I think after being cleared she'll transfer/drop out of her current college, go to a more affordable state school and she may or may not decide to drop her political science degree for a while from a disillusionment of the workings of government. My personal head cannon is that she would dive into public health which would use her knowledge of policy making and allow her to fall back into her passion for helping society as a whole as well as the under-priveleged. 

I assume that Henry's last year at the private highschool might have been helped along by Stan financially until he could graduate where he then manages to secure a practically all expenses paid scholarship at a small and not very prestigious liberal arts school, though with a supportive social environment, due to high SAT scores where he buries himself in making friends and studying despite not really getting close to any of them. At first its even hard for him to trust Stan or Paige but he eventually comes around to them, meeting with Paige at least twice a year from then and spending the holidays with Stan. Eventually he graduates with honors in business and entrepeneurship. Eventually he climbs the corporate ladder and becomes a w ell off CFO for a fortune 500 corp before he leaves to found his own successful company.

Essentially one of the best ways to help depression and dread is behavioral activation or creating a safe space which in my case was building a strong and healthy community of friends, exploring the subjects that I liked and did well in or the tv shows and books that I liked, and taking part extracurriculars (which helped the building of friends.) People seem to underestimate the importance of a strong social environment and it seems that when your son lost the chance to interact with the majority of friends in school things got harder. Try to help him be more active in socializing, making friends and talking about his interests and I think that that could be helpful."
mythology,fg2pikm,t3_ewcmcl,1580450906.0,This is crazy I was just reading that myth. But yeah I love your'e style
OCD,fg2cvy4,t3_ewg0ss,1580442625.0,I wish my terrified 9 year old agnostic self with seriously atheist parents heard that other people felt this way. I used to think that I was a special kind of crazy.
TheGoodPlace,fg2c5pf,t3_ewhhrt,1580442244.0,The craziest thing is that the calendar was the moment that I started sobbing. It was just so beautiful of a gift to her.
TheGoodPlace,fg2bpnw,t3_ewhyy6,1580442019.0,"Pobody's nerfect.........

but also that everyone is capable of growth especially through their bonds with other people."
TheGoodPlace,fg2b3gq,t3_ewi0wp,1580441709.0,Shoot the more that people point out how beautiful this damn show is the sadder I get. But yeah cheers to Chidi he is sincerely such an inspiration and an incredible character.
GilmoreGirls,fg2av2p,t3_ewg5lw,1580441593.0,"Emily is an amazing character, she's a classic initially painted villain that shows incredible complexity with each appearance to the point that the audience (or at least me) can't help but empathize with her because we see her humanity and each good thing that she does is emphasized by their rarity. I am always excited to watch a story with her in it to see her character show me more depth. Also side note Kelly Bishop is straight up bomb, sooo good."
roommateproblems,fg29exc,t3_ew934s,1580440865.0,"Hi so I'm one of those spacey creatives and I've had ADHD my whole life as well but the fact of the matter is that regardless of what ever you have you should make the extra effort in taking care of the public spaces. My room is a black hole of stuff with a barely carved out path from the door to the bed and my car is chockful of art, journals, water bottles, plastic bags, ketchup packets etc. But I've been making the active effort to clean up after myself in the shared living space. Its a thing like a deadline for school, I have more trouble to get it done than the average person but it gets done most of the time because it comes with the territory of school; same with work; and same with having roommates. I do mess up a lot but I try to remedy it because its just part of being a good housemate. 

So TLDR, try to say hey love you girl but could you finish your dishes because I'm super tired from school and it'd be a huge help. It is a bit awkward or tense but its really good to get it out there and if everyone is mature then it smooths out after a while especially if you hang out and have fun afterwards. 

Sorry if this sounds preachy or rambly I've just been this person and I wanted to help maybe. But yeah good luck with roomie stuff"
Scrubs,fg26196,t1_fg0abbx,1580439091.0,The best part was Franklin's face. I've never seen an actor so perfectly made me go ohhhh nooo as that expression he had.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffwwrze,t3_evlsbg,1580312781.0,"I take naps in my car at university all of the time. Don't worry about people thinking that it's weird because honestly we all know that you gotta do what you gotta do. People cry in their car, smoke sleep chill with music to destress in semi privacy after a test. You do you"
gallifrey,ffj91n2,t1_ffeql2a,1579993312.0,Sorry to be off of the Who topic but I'd argue that the Good Place as another example of dumb people doing clever things (ie: Jason Mendoza)
gallifrey,ffj82hh,t1_ffisph9,1579992704.0,Is it ok if I ask why withfinders is so high? It didn't really do anything for me but people really seem to like it so I wanted to know your opinion.
TheLastAirbender,fffkjsh,t3_et45v0,1579885958.0,I love all of these short beautiful comics about repairing the world. I love that atla set the basis for so many healing and wholesome stories its seriously wonderful.
gallifrey,ff9cqh4,t1_ff92dx5,1579710063.0,Exactly! It could have been so good and it was a charming premise. I feel like the torchwood episode random shoes did a nicer job of a similar premise
Anxiety,ff438av,t3_ercttk,1579554567.0,Seriously thats awesome! Its so hard to do and I've backed out of many dates in the past couple of years but I'm seriously so happy that you got past your anxiety and went to one!
Showerthoughts,ff38kmx,t3_erb9p7,1579536241.0,"Honestly its straight up beautiful and miraculous that we've invented this system that everyone  in a car driving society has to trust at least 80%. You've still got accidents, drunk drivers, wild animals crossing, but you've still got this implicit expectation that everyone will drive on their side of the line. Its this kind of necessary implicit optimism and its so cool."
Pottermore,ff23ycl,t3_er25j3,1579493150.0,oh man! That was my first ever Harry Potter meme. Thanks for posting it seriously.
washingtondc,fekiuiy,t3_ep9k7q,1579200955.0,Honestly it looks so much more beautiful to me like this....though extremely inconvenient
tamorapierce,fekhe8w,t3_epl21v,1579200086.0,"I know that someone probably already said this but I really hope that they could capture her insane drive and remember to show how it makes her great rather than her being inherently talented. I've noticed that to happen to a lot of YA female characters where they feel the need to portray them as almost perfect for them to be ""strong"" i.e. Movie Hermione. Alanna is amazing for how she fights to make herself as good as she could be."
TooAfraidToAsk,fekcbz1,t3_epdpsb,1579197077.0,I know that this is not the main question but when it comes to endgame it's more of a crossovers are so hype with a bunch of easy to define familiar characters who were normally separated coming together. There seems to be something so inherently exciting in that.
gallifrey,fekc275,t1_feiks4t,1579196915.0,Honestly we need more companions only episodes with maybe one villain and no other guests stars like Amy's choice which despite your thoughts on the story gave the characters more of a chance to interact with and breathe. Or the girl who waited which was beautiful and gave moffat the chance to play with drama and the actors some time to really explore their relationships.
gallifrey,fdoyct4,t1_fdnvid7,1578615687.0,Exactly that's what hurts she's just a different doctor with a whole other manner rather than the person following Capaldi and his growth. But I guess if viewed completely separately it is a choice
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdl5d5m,t3_eluufk,1578517321.0,"Wow thanks for the post! I had no idea that other people feel this way and I sincerely thought that there was something wrong with me. The comments are fantastic, I always do similar things like take a shower and pamper myself then wear a comfy but cute outfit."
mentalhealth,fdkg21f,t3_elplj2,1578503108.0,I call it my dangerous doubt because the doubt itself is so much more harmful then the actual things that I am worried about. But yeah it normally comes from anxiety or depression or low self esteem.
AskReddit,fdizomz,t3_eled64,1578454769.0,Nitpicking arguments to the point that the actual point made was lost in many people arguing about hardly relevant details
TooAfraidToAsk,fd7ravx,t3_ek0v8h,1578208868.0,I'm scared that I have the opposite problem...all of my friends say that they don't feel like the same person as them even a year ago but I always feel like I'm still so very much the same person with add ons and changed opinions since I was maybe 7...is there something wrong
HisDarkMaterialsHBO,fcmcoy2,t3_ehv0vm,1577770646.0,Wow I forgot how charming the writing was its kind of inspiring me to reread.
adhd_anxiety,fcl7gev,t3_ehjege,1577741453.0,Thanks for your post I also seriously love this sub. My diagnosis of ADHD has been ground breaking for my self forgiveness and so has finding other people like me through it. Even your calling your post word vomit was relatable. Tldr: thanks for posting it helps :)
HisDarkMaterialsHBO,fbwwqvb,t1_fbvwsyg,1577161510.0,"I think that this actually really worked because even though there wasn't much plot it at least familiarized us to him. We don't know that much about him except for the basics but we know his name, we feel sympathetically towards him and we see him going. Also I think that in the following seasons, his and Lyra's journeys will run parallel and this already gave an impression of two lost people embarking on this journey simultaneously which could not be as effectively done in one episode because we wouldn't feel the time, he would just be a kid who turned up next to Lyra."
HisDarkMaterialsHBO,fbwwd9c,t1_fbwmkos,1577161223.0,Dude you're twisting the knife right there Roger and Salcilia were the cutest :(.
ChronicPain,fbmmplb,t3_eduo23,1576986077.0,Or you could do what I do and put a clean sheet on top of the dirty ones. life hacks!
insomnia,fbmknyi,t3_edt75p,1576985223.0,"I do the exact same thing, its enough to let you off the hook for sleeping and feeling anxious about needing sleep always contributes to insomnia."
NoStupidQuestions,fbir81v,t3_edjlyv,1576910712.0,"Because every person craves socialization, it releases dopamine, oxytocin, and a lot of the time it gives our brain healthy activation and emotional grounding. Butttttt.......human interaction could involve a lot of stress, convoluted socializing threads, unpredictable other people who could be hurtful, inattentive or might be at a different vibe than you that day. 

So yeah its a part of life, I try to deal with it by having frequent social interaction because I crave it for the reasons above but to go in braced for unexpected turbulence and I take time to recover afterwards. Also if you love the people that you are hanging out with then thats always a bonus"
harrypotter,fbhfaut,t1_fbg5wy3,1576872287.0,"I couldn't help but wonder that too but at the end of the day, after all of the backlash that she received, she had the chance and the impetus to research further and amend the tweet or write a clarifying one but she never did."
