AnimalCrossing,fou71au,t3_g9fqee,1588077845.0,omg imagine if we had like nookstagram where you could share pictures of your island and they would pop up on your friends’ feeds!
mentalhealth,fon6zr8,t3_g8fq4i,1587913602.0,"oh my gosh i’ve never related to anything more, i always thought i was the only one! 

and this sucks because we end up ignoring the people we love most :("
mentalhealth,fon6uif,t3_g7zq6x,1587913511.0,your happiness is contagious and i can feel it through my screen :) proud of you !
mentalhealth,fon6pvc,t3_g8dzst,1587913432.0,"i’m only 16 so my advice will probably be really bad but maybe try getting invested in some sort of (positive, of course) media? like maybe a video game or a tv series or a book series. i find when i lock myself in my room with a game or a good book i can drown out whatever’s happening in the rest of my house / my mind for hours.

i also stay up most of the night when everyone else is sleeping and sleep through the day when they’re awake, but i don’t recommend doing that because it messed up my sleep schedule and made my insomnia worse :("
animalcrossingmeme,foi3lks,t3_g7g5lo,1587778025.0,i don’t think i’ll get bored of time travelling tbh
ibs,fnjgl6n,t3_g24epg,1586998546.0,"i relate to this so much ! i’m 16 and everything i eat is a problem, i’m always in pain and feeling bloated and discomfort and acid reflux and so many other things i can’t even describe. i can’t even remember the last time i went through a full day feeling okay."
mentalhealth,fnh5agx,t1_fngbzdl,1586955194.0,"i personally think it’s good for anyone who feels overpowered by the weight of the world and just needs a release. playing animal crossing is a feeling i can’t describe, it kind of puts me in a different state where i forget all the hardships of the real world for awhile and just focus on my town. it’s really therapeutic for me and even if you don’t feel that way, i still think you should try it out because it’s really calming :)"
mentalhealth,fngm5j2,t1_fnghdl8,1586936774.0,thankyou sm for recommending it bc i was deciding whether to get odyssey or smash but im gonna go with odyssey since i loved super mario 3d land on my 3ds. and yeah sims 4 is really boring without dlc :/

mentalhealth,fhgxakk,t3_f2xltz,1581583381.0,"wow, this hits close as i also have a three year old cockapoo that my mom gets annoyed with and regrets buying often. getting rid of a pet behind someone’s back is just horrible and i’m so sorry that happened to you. my best advice would be to maybe volunteer at a shelter, because you’ll be able to create bonds with the dogs there and it’ll give you something to look forward to. im so heartbroken to hear this happened but i know you’ll pull through. stay strong <3"
Anxiety,fhet72j,t1_fheobag,1581529417.0,yes! and it happened to someone yesterday in school and i was in the hallway w them when it happened and i think that’s a big reason to why im so anxious today. it’s horribleee

SuicideWatch,ffw6ivs,t3_evjp90,1580286627.0,"set a goal. even if it’s a really stupid one. or get like a plant to take care of or a small pet if you like animals. just something that’ll give you a reason to wake up the next day or at least distract you from getting those thoughts until you feel more motivated or something good happens. i know it sounds really dumb but when i’m at my all time lows whatever anyone says to me will go through one ear and out the other, so having a reason to actually stay alive another day is the only thing that saves me."
