CBD_UK,etewun5,t3_caz2b9,1562750744.0,"The Holland and Barrett ones are kinda cheap and weak. They are good to start with but something else may be better if you are looking for value for money. Taking CBD sublingually (under the tongue) is by far the most effective for general use because the CBD is absorbed directly into your bloodstream- capsules go into your digestive system and a huge chunk of the CBD is wasted. Other ways like vapes, balms and even bath bombs are somewhat effective but most of the CBD is wasted so don't waste your cash. Get an organic oil and make sure it is lab tested.

There is a company near me that I use called CBDiablo in Edinburgh. They do a couple of hemp oils that are the same ish price as H&B and give money to charity."
endometriosis,eq09q02,t1_eq07tyh,1559680627.0,"Everybody is different so different people need different amounts. Some need a couple of drops and others need more. It is all based on the stimulation of our endocannabinoid systems - so because everyone is unique the outcome is also unique to the user. Maybe you need to take a stronger oil? What % did you try and where was it from? Those factors make a huge difference.

And yes, THC high is better for pain but it is illegal in the UK and lots of states so CBD is all some people have right now. It is an anti-inflammatory among other things, so can certainly help lots of people. (Edit) Also CBD flower is also good but it is quicker in and quicker out thus giving you an immediate buzz. The oils, capsules and ingestible products etc.. stay in your system for longer and your body responds better to a consistent dose. 

My GF uses CBD oil for her Endo and combines it with a OTC pain killer and swears by it."
