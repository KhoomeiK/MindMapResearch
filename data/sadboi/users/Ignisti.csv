I mean, it's several different concepts that people aren't able to separate, and then they attack one concept and feel like they've disproven them all. Yes, smurfs have higher chance to be on the enemy team (5 players) than yours (4 players). No, smurfs aren't the reason you've plateaued, not even with the above considered. Yes, smurfs are a problem and a cause of shitty games. Yes, you can still have good games even with smurfs present on either team and yes, different people will tolerate it differently, or not care at all. Yes, you can learn from smurfs. No, not everybody wants to learn from smurfs nor should they be required to. Yes, you can want smurfless competitive games. You're allowed to want them even if you don't actually improve. You can dislike smurfs for different reasons.

It baffles me how a smug ""haha you're bad :)"" is even considered a response valid enough to upvote. Like, yeah, I'm bad. I lost a lane to smurf. Everything else invalidated I guess. Peak Reddit."
