It's already a HUGE commitment to be a bridesmaid, it's also a BIG deal flying to another country.

Also... are your friends essential workers or are they currently not working? Because if they're earning less or not at all because of COVID, regardless of restrictions in August, they may honestly not be capable of attending.

My only comment is it generally takes more than a couple of months to sell and finalise a house, plus buying on top. Imagine taking that much time away from being with your father. There is a chance your DH could lose him before there is this new house. It's better to put that on the back burner and focus on time with FIL."
relationships,fdg6yg5,t3_el5fpe,1578382552.0,"I know a few people with Bipolar have already commented so maybe I should have continued in that thread but oh well, here it is. Haha.



I also have Bipolar and Bipolar rage is very real and can be one of the hardest things to work through and manage. For me, I found even when I found the correct medication and stabilised, I needed talk therapy to work through the rage.



While Bipolar has a lot of common traits throughout those diagnosed, it's still a very personal thing. There could be a chance that he's actions are due to unmedicated Bipolar OR he could just be an arsehole. 



It's worrisome that he wouldn't even try medication for a week. It took three - four months for me to stabilise on mine. It can also take some people years of different medication and/or cocktails. This is something he will have to continually work on and be ready to do so. He'll need to regularly see a psychologist and psychiatrist. I should be seeing my psychologist monthly and do see my psychiatrist yearly. If he won't make that commitment, it won't work. 




Don't let Bipolar overrule any decisions you make about the relationship. When I was diagnosed, I gave my partner the option of an out. He didn't sign up for what we were about to go through and we hadn't been together long. He stayed and things are great but I would have never held it against him if chose differently. Also, at the end of the day, he had a diagnosis and chose to disregard it for 25 years. Will that happen again after he's stable for three years? Will he take it seriously this time? 



Some final thoughts - him saying he grew up that way and didn't know any better is a cop out. My Dad had an abusive father and made efforts to not be like him. And the times he did something from his childhood he didn't realise was negative (I.e. you can't leave the table until you eat all your food), my mum pulled him up on it and he stopped. You brought up his abusive behaviour toward your son and he didn't stop. Also... why just your eldest? If it was purely about his childhood, why not all three children? Something doesn't add up here - unless it's like a previous posted said about puberty and opinions.



Also, you've talked about years of lows... has he had any upswings were he's been overly energetic and social? The hypomanic or manic side of bipolar? I know I am a rapid cycler so maybe my view is incorrect but it feels strange if he's had 5 years of persistent depressive symptoms with no upswings. Unless he's had mixed episodes? I'd recommend doing some research on bipolar which might give you an understanding of what I mean. There's also a subreddit for bipolar partners where you may receive some tailored support.



And ACTUALLY lastly, haha. Therapy is a great idea for the family. It's often advised that the ""support people"" in a Bipolar persons life have solo therapy and at times are involved in their therapy to help understand triggers and signs of changing moods. Plus, there is evidence to genetics contributing to bipolar disorder, so if therapy is normalised to the kids now, any future mood issues may be easier to address.



I really hope things look up for you all. Remember - you need to put your own life mask on before assisting anyone else."

Shaming in the way you described is horrendous. Probably one of the best ways to hurt your children is humiliating them.

relationships,fd0nei6,t3_ejqot4,1578121218.0,"Honestly, I've had suicidal ideation more times than I'd like to admit. I could completely understand if my family or my partner went snooping- even if it was on here or my internet history in order to keep me safe. I recently started a job in mental health and they trained us to flat out ask if they have a plan and depending on the answers, we will call their treating parties or police for a welfare check. They probably feel like it's an invasion to have police come to their homes but fuck, it's our duty of care.



Of course, there has been times I have lashed out when depressed but I've never blamed my depression on anyone else - even when there's been people who have genuinely harmed me. This is toxic behaviour and you need to protect yourself AND your kids. What if he starts lashing out at them? 



If you aren't seeing a therapist already, you need to. There's no way dealing with this couldn't be affecting your own mental health. You could also discuss with them how you want to seperate - even if not permanently- and are worries how that will affect him in regards to the suicidal ideation. I'm not sure how to combat that but they may have advice.



It sounds like if you were to bring up separation again, he would still have the same feelings about not seeing the kids. Perhaps you could reassure him that something could be put in place to ensure he still sees them very frequently.



Idk, OP. This sucks and I feel for you so much."

personalfinance,fccqind,t1_fcco9mu,1577601448.0,"Thank you!



I'm salary at $65k (works out at $1999 a fortnight in hand) and my boyfriend probably averages $80k. He's a mechanic and has different rates depending on which area he works. He also does overtime occasionally but at the same hourly rate. Future progression for me could be $90k within two years if I do well in the business and can land a promotion to the next step (career progression is huge in my company and I've looked at the salary package for the position I'm most suited to develop in). For my boyfriend, he could possibly move to a different area with his current employer which would take him to $2000 a week. 




Debt wise: he has two credit cards (one is interest free) and probably totals around $9000. He always meets the minimum and often puts more toward it. My debt really embarrasses me. I'm closer to $20k and on payment agreements. I was paying more off them at one stage (got rid of a $3000 credit card in six months) but have fallen back on that as I took on more financial responsibility in the relationship. I could definitely get back on top of paying extra though and plan to! I think my partner could easily become debt free next year where I think I could within two years. Maybe earlier once I sort a budget out with my partner. We're both happy to do this just great procrastinators."

Unless things have been left out, it sounds like you maybe didn't do a great job of explaining to ex where ""daddy"" has come from - like how you set it out here. I'd like to think that is why he's blown up - that he genuinely thinks you're ""forcing"" her to say that.



Regardless, his reaction still makes him TA. Calling in his Mum for back up. Haha.

If OP's friend has a serious mental illness like Bipolar or Schizophrenia, logic falls on the way side. I'm not well versed in Schizophrenia but Bipolar psychosis can be triggered by many ""small"" or ""insignificant"" life events and every person has different triggers. Even good things can trigger it - a promotion at work can lead to mania and then psychosis. 



It doesn't make sense. That's part of the mental illness. If it was all JUST to do with him wanting to be in a relationship with OP, he wouldn't have suddenly flipped at the engagement. There would have been prior signs like flipping when OP and her fiance moved in together or started making financial decisions together, avoiding them as a couple, etc."

OP is taking attention from the Bride and Groom but the people who paid for the wedding deserve for it to be how THEY want. Are the Bride and Groom literally just putting on a show for their friends and family? Weddings are supposed to be a celebration of the Bride and Groom and contain what they want. It's unfortunately common that people get railroaded by a parent after they offer to pay but paying shouldn't be an excuse control the event.

I've just finished reading your posts and I never expected this last update would include such horrific childhood trauma. Please, please, if you haven't done it already, put some strategies in place for if you feel yourself wanting to reach out to your mother. With Bipolar, therapists often get you to create an emergency kit/plan for if you find yourself becoming manic or depressed. I feel like you could benefit from a laid out plan of things to do if you start to feel that pull or if you're confronted with contact or another extinction burst without your wife being there to ground you and remind you why you're doing all of this.



A lot of people are telling you to remember you're doing this for your daughter. I want to tell you not to forget that you're also doing this for you.
