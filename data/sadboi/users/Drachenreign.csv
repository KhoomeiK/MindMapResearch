We love to observe, the problem is that half-way through most 'gossip' situations we have enough information to analyze that the conversation is no longer worth listening to and avert our attention elsewhere.

I wasn't super self-conscious particularly about my height until later, maybe early-twenties, but I've always been incredibly self-conscious in general. People thought I was weird, so I'd act out and become the class clown. I've always been small, so I've had to adapt. Comedy is my self-defense mechanism, and because of that, I became very good at it. But the self-deprecating jokes do sink in. Whether you believe the shitty things you say about yourself or not, at the end of the day, you said them to get your through to the next one; something negative about you rings true through that.

When it all clicked for me is when I fell for this girl. I changed my clothes and hairstyle and started listening to 'emo' bands like Alkaline Trio and AFI. Suddenly, I went from having 0 friends, to having to ignore people because I just didn't have the time. I realized how vain people are, and it broke my heart. I thought friendship was going to be so much more than that.

I blasted through my 'popular' years. I toured in a band and played plenty before and after that but I guess I did what they call rubber-banding and I'm sort of back where I started, in this hole, alone, with no self-confidence or motivation. It sounds like our perspective and persona are very similar. I act like I don't give a shit, even when I do (and usually I really don't).

I've honestly always felt this way, and there's some anime that I've watched almost specifically for this reason, and some that --while I'm not going to complain-- it's just so out-of-place and unnecessary.

I do 'well' around other people and I don't really have anxiety about it, I'd just rather be alone most the time. I'm certainly awkward, but it's not anything different than how I act when I'm alone.

I don't really know how to be empathetic. I have feelings, but they basically never show.

Whatever it is that I'm interested in at the time, I become hyper-focused, even obsessed with. I'm the most 'perfectionist' person I've ever met. Things must be the way I intend for them to be, or I willingly stop caring about it. I don't like surprises, and I don't like change.

I have fantastic language skills and I'm incredibly well informed, but I my verbal skills are awful. There's time where I'm face-to-face with someone but would find it much easier to express words by text rather than speaking.

If I had to give any advice and you're anything like me; Don't work with 'people', work with things. I'm a data analyst/programmer. The problem isn't that it's not doable or that you won't be good at it, but that it drains a lot of energy and you won't want to socialize outside of work. (Well you might never 'want' to, but you'll want to even less). Having the motivation to force yourself to socialize is very important for your mental state. And yes, unfortunately you might always have to force yourself.

wartrade,fp5ufs3,t3_gbhgtb,1588340155.0,"this is not good. mind you, it's a bramma riven, it will still get plat, but no one's going to run this mod as is."
bloodborne,fp5tpxi,t1_fp59n8c,1588339690.0,I'm convinced his arms are longer in my game. Only way I beat him is fighting in front and rolling at the right time.
bloodborne,fp5tkjd,t1_fp5bfce,1588339592.0,"Same as you, I started with Demons Souls and found Bloodborne incredibly hard. Sekiro on the other hand, I found to be very easy. It clicked right away and aside from Genichiro I breezed through that game."
JRPG,fp4teu6,t3_gb9jx9,1588306921.0,FFXI I guess. Is it bad that I don't think I've enjoyed a JRPG that was made in the last 8 years?
PewdiepieSubmissions,fp4s43t,t3_gb7e8d,1588305998.0,maybe only Edgar and Maya will even be able to hear frequencies that high.
AskReddit,fp4rybo,t3_gb33ag,1588305890.0,"I'm going to get a lot of push-back on this one, but The Great Gatsby. Maybe it's just my affinity for the actors, but I actually like the characters in the movie. Every single character in the book is awful."
SmashBrosUltimate,fp4hb8h,t3_gb01d2,1588299047.0,"This is how I imagine other players must see me. Some games I play like a fking god, and other games I SD 3x in a row."
bloodborne,fp4eflk,t1_fp3vxnc,1588297286.0,"As a 'Soul Veteran' with multiple SL1 and no hit runs under my  belt, I still find Cleric Beast one of the hardest bosses on any of the games. It took me several long breaks to finally get through him. The rest of the game I found relatively easy."
bloodborne,fp4e6so,t3_gb3hy9,1588297139.0,Had an ex that hated Dark Souls (because I'd play that all the time instead of spend time with her). We played Drunk Souls with another couple and her first try to made it all the way to the bridge before the dragon killed her. She didn't lock on once or listen to any advice. I was mindblow.
excel,fp1ulce,t1_fp0cr57,1588248237.0,"Hell yeah, I just got Excel 2010 a few weeks ago. Looking forward to trying XLOOKUP in the next decade.. or century."
MagicArena,fp0tves,t1_fp0sjmj,1588216802.0,"Naw, maybe I should build one though since my EDH decks are often too strong for my playgroups. I play Maelstrom Wanderer Good Stuff, Nekusar Wheels, and Damia Birthing Pod."
Warframe,fozs694,t1_fozilpi,1588195928.0,"I'm sure my head was somewhere else when I originally saw the OP. I've been really obsessed with time management and scheduling recently in my personal life, so that's what came to mind."
intj,fozruiz,t1_foyq0ae,1588195764.0,"That's the big difference between psychiatry and therapy. A therapist can't prescribe medication. Whether you're OK with medication or not, having that incentive taken off the table means you're a more likely to have a genuine interaction."
MagicArena,fozrci6,t1_foyp84f,1588195519.0,"Probably less than 10% honestly lol. A lot of games I just concede after Etrata is killed/countered 2 times. Without any haste option, removal-heavy decks just hose the whole plan."
