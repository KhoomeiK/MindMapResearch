pelotoncycle,fog5f6e,t3_g73sx8,1587748120.0,New to the community but have been riding for a while — I had been riding at my school's gym but we just got a bike at home since COVID has closed the gym. Problem is that all the metrics are totally different now (far more than 10% difference). It also feels so much harder at the same resistances. I read about calibration and am wondering if it's worth it to calibrate our new bike. Could the gym ones have been calibrated wrong because they were used so much by so many different users every day? If that's the case I feel like I should just leave our bike alone and get used to the increased difficulty/lower numbers.

My experience is colored by my and my brother’s struggles with mental health, but this does not read as “ghosting” (I usually think of that as something someone does after a few mediocre dates, not something someone does to cut previously daily contact with their parents).

However, I am curious what she has been diagnosed with if anything. I have bipolar (specifically bipolar II) but was undiagnosed and untreated for several years before getting into therapy, during which time I was extremely symptomatic. One of the most prominent symptoms for me was irritability, and I often broke down over admittedly trivial things (misplacing something, malfunctioning GPS, etc). Since getting into therapy and — more importantly I think — getting on medication, this has happened maybe two times in the last three years and each time was much much tamer and only lasted a couple minutes at most. 

If you’re interested in making it work, I highly recommend getting her to a psychiatrist if you haven’t already (and if you have, perhaps a second opinion is in order).  Still, I was never violent towards anyone except myself, and to the best of my memory never threatened SOs with breakups, so, underlying issue or no, those might very well be dealbreakers for you and fairly so."

I don’t think you have to change your appearance for class or the library or general campus life to conform to any specific style. You should have a plain-ish suit or two for networking, receptions, and interviews, but that’s really the only time you need to dress in a way that might seem foreign or toned down as compared to your usual style.

At this point, the weight gain is so upsetting to me that I think it’s worth going off the medication entirely, but I want to make sure I have my doctor’s supervision before discontinuing."
bipolar2,etcdou7,t1_etcde57,1562682318.0,"Good for you!!! I’m glad you’ve been able to regain that confidence. I have gained ~30 lbs and am also short so it definitely shows. My big fear is that going off the abilify won’t do anything and that i’ll keep gaining, but it sounds like it helped you to switch meds!"
bipolar2,etcctto,t1_etccfvu,1562681704.0,"I have the same problem. I used to run half marathons and exercise very often, but I started grad school and it really disrupted my ability to exercise and since then I have been packing on pounds even though I eat fairly well and walk everywhere and still work out sometimes. It’s so frustrating to feel like nothing makes a difference unless it is very extreme."
bipolar2,etccks3,t1_etccgbw,1562681525.0,That’s true! I like exercise so that wouldn’t be too much of a chore for me. I’ve just been somewhat discouraged because on the abilify it doesn’t seem to do anything for me.
bipolar2,etcc06p,t1_etcbvcc,1562681108.0,Thank you for the response! Unfortunately this is what I was afraid of. I have a history of eating disorders and calorie counting typically isn’t for me. I guess I will have to learn to cope with being overweight if the weight doesn’t come off with time.
