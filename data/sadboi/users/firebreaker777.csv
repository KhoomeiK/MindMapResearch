satanism,fqyjy9s,t3_gljuxq,1589749807.0,"I’ve been depressed, I’ve self-harmed because of it, and I’ve been talked out of suicide many times. 

Depression is a natural condition that can happen to a person because of all kinds of things, from internal to external, self-caused to not self-caused. Some people can find their way out of it on their own. Some people need help. Others tragically never feel better. I’m not sure if I have an “opinion on depression.” It sucks?

Self harm is a behavior some people engage in. Some self-harm is cultural or involuntary. The self-harm we’re talking about is emotion-driven. The average age that people start is 13. For people (especially younger people) self harm can quickly become an addiction. The belief is that physical injury causes a chemical change in the brain which temporarily eases the stress caused by emotional pain. Self harm is a very complicated and poorly understood behavior. As requested by OP this is my opinion:

I’d say there are two main groups self-harmers fall into, which are distinguished by the “goal” of the person. I’m going to choose my words carefully here. This is a very sensitive topic and self-harmers will probably read this. I think I myself have been both types of self-harmer at one point or another, but one of the groups is very much demonized and illegitimized by everyone, both inside and outside the medical community, and even among others who self-harm.

Most self-harmers do not have significant emotional support from their friends and family. They are usually people who have learned to hide their emotions away because the reactions they received from others were negative. In my own personal experience, around the time I began self-harming I was living with my parents who were uncomfortable with my extreme displays of emotion. They would often suggest that I take my emotions somewhere else, and would not be able to talk about them with me. We tried therapy but I never trusted the therapist. I ended up “getting clean” on my own only to relapse years later when I moved out. I became completely isolated from my friends, who had become my emotional support. Feeling alone again, I turned back to the sharps. I am now 5 years self-harm free.

In a moment of extreme emotion and frustration with nowhere to turn, the self-harmer breaks the painful cycle happening in their head by introducing physical pain. Everyone describes the “relief” differently. For me, I considered it like a distraction from my emotional pain and a ritual to convince myself to care for myself. I would, though this isn’t always common, take very good care of my wounds as they healed. I think this helped me recover and when I offer advice to people who are still struggling, I suggest improving their first aid rather than suggest they stop. Telling any addict to “just stop” is not going to work. 

Once the act is done the person now has two options: hide or tell. This person is starved for quality attention and has nowhere to take their pain. One reaction, the “acceptable” one, is to hide it completely. You’ll find if you ever go to a self-harm subreddit or other online community that many of the posts are along the lines of “my family is going swimming tomorrow, how do I hide my c*ts?” Or “I’m going to a doctor for an unrelated thing, what do I say if they ask? Will they tell my parents?” Most of the time, the goal is to hide. Conceal don’t feel. The emotions aren’t welcome with others, so hide the scars, too. This is the “acceptable” type of self-harmer. Their goal is to hide.

The other option is to tell. This is the other type of self-harmer, the one that is illegitimized and used by assholes to undermine the legitimacy of all self-harmers. This person, after feeling completely alone and being overwhelmed with pain, reaches out to someone rather than hide away. They might tell the person, or they might even send pictures of the wounds. 

I’ll take a moment to say: please do not send pictures of your wounds to anyone without asking. That’s not cool. I’ve done this, it’s a mistake, it ruins friendships and puts people in uncomfortable situations. 

The goal of this person is not necessarily to seek help, but to share pain, be seen, and be acknowledged. These are the “attention seekers.” If you look down on people who “just do X for attention,” consider that maybe they do need the attention, but they need a different kind of attention than what they’re seeking. These are not bad people or spoiled brats, they’re just unfathomably lonely and hurting. 

There is also the “third” kind... abusers who hit themselves to frame someone for domestic violence. This is not the same thing and I won’t even bother discussing it further. I have nothing in common with those people. 

Now that I’ve stepped off my self-harm soapbox I’ll step up onto the suicide one. I believe that life is precious, as this is the only time we ever get to experience any kind of pleasure or happiness. However in the world we live in sometimes pleasure is hard to come by. I definitely think there are some cases where death is more humane than life, and in those cases we should have doctors in charge of administering a painless death. 

In cases where situations can be improved, though, I think it’s very nice of people to try to help. I don’t think it’s really anyone’s obligation to stop someone from killing themselves. Sometimes the burden of another person’s life is heavy. I spent a year recently talking a friend out of suicide again and again. I didn’t want to let her go. Now she’s more “stable,” but her life and health are only getting worse. Sometimes when she confides in me I wonder if I’m really doing the right thing by encouraging her to live. If she does decide to take her life, am I going to feel like I should have done more for her? Probably. I’m also going to feel a little relieved, because she won’t be suffering anymore. 

I don’t regret all the time I spent supporting her emotionally, because in the end we’ve fostered a strong friendship and each learned emotional resiliency, but this did teach me to think before leaping after someone else. You can’t save everybody. I am very grateful for everyone who put in the time and effort to argue with me about my own life and it’s value. My life did get better, and I’m happy I’m still here. It took the combined effort of everyone who ever tried to stop me from ending it to get me here. 

This was long. I’ll summarize.

TL;DR

Depression: it sucks

Self-harm: self harmers are poorly understood and frequently brushed off as “attention-seekers” which is unfair and untrue in most cases. 

Suicide: life gets better unless it doesn’t."

TrueOffMyChest,fqcdu14,t1_fqc5rmt,1589255796.0,"I think your reaction is also normal. I did not mean to claim that it would be abnormal to not feel bad for them. Both reactions seem reasonable to me. Of course it’s normal to be revolted and enraged by what happened to the Goler children, and to acknowledge that what the Goler adults did was evil. 

For the record, I think your hostility toward me was normal too. Anyone who defends sex offenders to any degree should be questioned, though I will claim I am not defending them. Just expressing some personal feelings about them. Apology accepted and no hard feelings. You sound like a good person. Your “attack” was quite tame. 

Upon reading about sympathy and empathy, sure, I feel empathy for them. I think I may be more likely to feel this way and to hold people in grey because of my own upbringing. I know many adults who, for reasons out of their control, were set down a path to do horrible things. I condemn their actions and I also see why it may have been difficult for them to do the right thing, even if they knew it was wrong. 

Human beings have a lot less free will than we like to think. You’d be surprised at what you may be capable of if you got caught up in the wrong crowd. (I am NOT claiming everyone is capable of rape just because the people around them are raping). All it takes is a crowd and a little bit of loyalty and you’ve got the ingredients for herd mentality, something none of us are immune to. The Goler’s, being intellectually challenged, were even more susceptible. The documentary even suggested that the oldest Goler children were likely to return to their family after aging out of foster care. The young ones are more likely to develop other loyalties to healthier people, but for the older ones it may have been too late, just like their parents before them. Depending on how much individual free will you really think people have, you could say they don’t have a choice. Their loyalties are already formed. They will be more likely to go along with whatever the rest of the Goler family does and thinks. 

No individual Goler had the strength to stand up
to all the others and say that what was happening was wrong, even if they knew it was. This makes them very dangerous, because as a group they are still capable of doing terrible things. They will also lie to cover for their family, as many of them reportedly did during the investigation. They are all powerless to acknowledge that their family, who they love, did something unspeakable.

Now I sound like I’m building up towards arguing that we should lock them all away in solitary confinement. Maybe that’s extreme. People like this should be watched very, very closely for the rest of their lives. Even if they seem remorseful, because of the circumstances, they are capable of being repeat offenders. Nothing they say can be trusted.

I understand why you feel the way you do. They probably knew it was wrong to some degree. There is evidence to suggest that they knew they could be punished if they were discovered. They threatened the children to keep them quiet, which is a huge sign that they weren’t completely ignorant.

Edit: gosh, sorry for the goddamn essay"
TrueOffMyChest,fqc4ly8,t1_fqbps8v,1589250011.0,"Yes they did need to be torn apart. 

Sympathy =/= that I think they shouldn’t have been punished or separated 

Sympathy =/= forgiveness

Sympathy =/= what they did was ok

Sympathy =/= they should be given another chance

Sympathy just means I feel bad for them. That’s it. I’m not saying they shouldn’t have been punished. I’m not saying they should have gotten to keep their kids. I’m not saying they are guiltless. I’m CERTAINLY not saying they should EVER have children again. OP’s post was entirely about whether we should be sympathetic. I have selected a SINGLE CASE where I think sympathy is a normal reaction. 

I’m just saying they didn’t get to choose whether they were born to people who were going to teach them to rape, and I pity them for that. 

I do also think justice was served, and I am of course VERY sympathetic to their victims. I hold these adults in grey. I neither hate them nor love them."
TrueOffMyChest,fqbxesu,t1_fqbkwik,1589245820.0,"I agree. As unfortunate as it is that some people are led to become offenders because of their upbringing and environment, and as much as we can debate whether  their actions are solely their fault, (my opinion) we must hand down punishment for every individual who commits a sexual offense against a minor. The severity of that punishment is up for lawyers to decide. 

In the case of the Goler’s there was a lot of debate about whether they should be punished at all. Some people believed they should be left alone, but not allowed to have children. Some people thought they should be locked away in an institution forever, or maybe just rehabilitated somehow. Some people thought the prison sentence was too short, some people thought it was too long.

A couple things stood out to me about the Goler’s response to their punishment. At the time of the documentary, some family members had been released from prison but some remained. They expressed that their lives had been completely disrupted. Overall, it didn’t seem like many felt remorse, probably because they still didn’t understand their crime and most continue to deny it. Several members became devoted Christians. 

I don’t think more prison time would have helped them see the error in their ways. I do think the huge disruption to their lives may make them think twice before doing it again. Their decision to become more religious followed the huge disruption. It’s possible that religion could allow them to acknowledge that they had committed a serious offense against their children and eventually some may feel remorse. 

It’s hard to find out what happened to them in the years following the documentary..."
TrueOffMyChest,fqbfsm4,t1_fqbaq9o,1589236169.0,I never claimed they were excused. This is merely an example where feeling sorry for the offenders is appropriate.
TrueOffMyChest,fqaubyo,t3_ghr2xv,1589225419.0,"I agree that people who have committed sexual offenses against a minor should be treated harshly and that no sympathy should be wasted on them that could be spent on the victim.

I’m not really here to argue with you but I am going to present a very extreme case where I do feel sympathy for the offenders.

In the 1980s in Canada a poor rural family caught national attention when several children came forward claiming that every child in their family was being sexually abused by virtually every adult. 

The abuse was generational and since the family had been there for over a hundred years it’s assumed that the offenders had also been victims of the generation before. In such an isolated place these children who were abused and became adults never had an opportunity to learn that what they were doing was wrong. 

The law got involved and the children were all removed and placed in foster care. The adults in the family are frankly not intelligent enough to completely understand that they had abused their children and that they had to be removed for their safety. From their point of view, everything was fine until the government suddenly came and took their kids away. Most got 2-4 years in prison. 

This is the part that makes me feel sympathetic for them. They really had no choice but to behave as everyone else in their family was behaving, and when necessary actions had to be taken to prevent further harm, it tore their family apart, and they don’t even really understand why.

With word problems it’s good to write down every little piece you can in math language. Take it component by component, one relationship between variables at a time. Make a list and name as many variables as you need to make it make sense to you. Here is how I turn this problem into math.

Sylvia had $10 more money than Leilani.

Sylvia’s money = 10 + Leilani’s money (S = 10 + L)

They went to the market and both bought a crepe for $5.

Sylvia’s new money = Sylvia’s money - 5 (Sn = S - 5)

Leilani’s new money = Leilani’s money - 5 (Ln = L - 5)

Now Sylvia has 6 times as much money as Leilani.

Sylvia’s new money = 6 * Leilani’s new money (Sn = 6*Ln)

The rest is just substitution. It might not be obvious but play around with it and try to combine all four equations. Eventually you’ll discover what Sn should be."

I only said that for some people it’s the main problem to highlight that lack of sleep can cause significant depression. For you it may be one of a few sources of distress. Regardless, if you start sleeping better, you WILL feel better. Will it make you feel 100% better? Probably not, but “100% better” is unobtainable anyway. Any improvement helps. 

I’ve struggled with sleep (and depression) all my life. I’ve tried everything for sleep. I’ve tried meditation, cutting out caffeine, mindfulness, herbal tea, hypnotism, no screen time 1 hour before bed, medications from antihistamines and melatonin to antipsychotics and tranquilizers, different sleep schedules, weighted blankets, moving into a room with an East-facing window instead of a west one, etc. Some work, but only a little, or only for a little while. The best solution is usually a combination.

It’s taken years of talking to therapists and psychiatrists to find the best solution for ME so far:

-being in a room with an East-facing window, preferably during sunrise and sunset (dark earlier, bright earlier). Black-out curtains are tempting but they can mess up your internal clock and make things worse so be wary.

-don’t use the bed for anything but sleep or sex. Spend the day somewhere else. Your brain needs to associate bed with sleep. Working in bed is the worst thing you can do (and I’m sure lots of WFH people are doing this now). Your brain won’t know it’s time to turn off. 

-no caffeine after 5pm (I’m a grad student, so this is hard)

-1 hour “downtime” before bed. If I try to go to sleep right after I’ve finished working for the day my brain won’t shut up. I need to do something else for a little while. 

-really try to stick to a bed time and a wake-up time

-plan for 9 or even 10 hours of sleep, my brain just needs more than the 7 or 8 some people survive on 

-a tiny dose of Seroquel, an antipsychotic, before bed

-sometimes I use a weighted blanket, weather permitting

-clean sheets 

-if I can’t sleep after an hour, I get up and do something for 20 minutes and try again. 


If I do all these things I can maintain a mostly normal sleep schedule. My solution is unique to me and the things that help you (and the degree to which they help you) will be different. Just give every solution an honest try until you find the things that work. Once you get sleep under control, it’s easier to work on the other sources of depression. Certainly, it will improve the quality of your morning ride.

Every math class I take, ever since high school and even into the classes I’m taking now, there’s always one concept that gets by me. I just don’t get it the first time around and I don’t have time to learn it because we need to move on to the next thing. I just accept this and let it go after trying my best. Learning 90% is enough.

These concepts will come back if they’re important. When I was first introduced to trigonometry in 9th grade I didn’t understand and I failed at every trig question. I assumed I would never understand and hoped I would never see it again. The next time I saw trig was in calculus. I knew that cosine was the derivative of sine but I didn’t understand much else. I retook calculus when I got to college. My professor drew a sine wave on the board and labeled 0, pi, and 2pi on the axis and suddenly it all clicked. I was still learning trigonometry even when I couldn’t answer a single question right. Now I use Euler’s identity and the complex exponential representations of trig functions in my work all the time, proving to myself that I understand. I just needed to see it a few times over a few years. It may have slowed me down at times to have not learned it the first time, but it didn’t stop me. I’m still chugging along towards this PhD.

This year something called the Finite Element Method came up in one of my classes. It’s a complicated way to solve a certain kind of complicated problem, the stuff that comes “after calculus.” The Finite Element Method is widely used but it’s notoriously difficult to understand. Naturally, I didn’t get it. I limped my way through that homework assignment and let it go. Maybe next time I see it I’ll get it. Whenever this happens, I remind myself, “it’s just like trig.”

There is a lot of content to every math class and some concepts are going to challenge you, temporarily defeat you, and come back later for a rematch. You’ll be more ready for it the next time."

I’ll reread homework assignments after I’ve turned them in. I’ll recall conversations I’ve had and try to remember everything I said word-for-word to check it any of it was “weird.” 

At least with that stuff my partner has gotten pretty good at recognizing it and can snap me out of it :) and since we’re both home all the time he’s been really helpful."

It sounds like your dog is like my dog. Wherever I leave her is a horrible prison she must escape, but whatever larger space she escapes to is fine. If I left her in the house, she would destroy the front door trying to get out, but if I leave her in her cage and she somehow gets out and into the house, she’s fine! Chills on the couch waiting for me."
OCD,fogto5z,t3_g78p1v,1587756856.0,"I used to have this body-positioning hyper-awareness that made me feel like I was going to be harshly judged for the way I was sitting. It would be worst when I was in a group where people might be looking at me. I’d sit in the back of classrooms to make sure the least number of people could see how I was sitting. I don’t sit particularly strangely, but this has lingered on and off in my life.

Now suddenly I’m on zoom hours a day and anyone could be watching my camera. I watch other people’s cameras because I miss them. They could easily be doing the same to me and I wouldn’t even know. Somehow, this doesn’t really bother me right now... like you, my OCD has bigger fish to fry and could care less about this previously-crippling anxiety. It’s nice to be present in conversations again rather than spending 110% of my mental energy compulsively checking my body’s position for “weirdness”. 

It’s not like my OCD has gotten better. It’s just changed. It’s weird that it does that. You would think an illness characterized by repetition would be a little more... predictable."
BirdsArentReal,foglutu,t1_fogli62,1587754252.0,"All that stuff was made in the 1950s and 60s to look old. It was the largest re-education in history. What I’m saying is while the birds outside had propellers, the birds in books had wings, and only recently did reality catch up with the fantasy."
BirdsArentReal,fogkvsz,t1_fod6os4,1587753869.0,"There were never any real birds, it’s just that the re-education program began before prototypes were completely developed. During planning the idea of “flapping wings” was floated because animals don’t typically have propellers and engines. This ended up being the model all the textbook writers used and by the time the engineers realized “flapping wings” were too difficult for 20th century technology it was too late... It took a while but the engineers finally figured it out and now drones with flapping wings are all you see and I bet most people can’t even remember a few years ago when “birds” still had propellers like the one in this video."
rareinsults,fo8s8iu,t1_fo792i5,1587602763.0,"2 Corinthians 11:13-15


For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.

Some kk slider album artwork has the title of the song in languages other than English, but it seems like most of it is English. I noticed the K.K. Moody album art has the words “Tota-bolero” on it. I googled and found that that is what the Spanish version of the game calls that song. Is the album artwork the same across all languages and geographic versions of the game? Do people in Japan have the English word “adventure” on their version of K.K. Adventure, for example?"

It’s not like this actually takes any attention away from those people in those other (also stressful, also valid) situations. 

This is nowhere near insane. Don’t know why it’s here. She is privileged that this is the kind of stress she’s dealing with, but we should take comfort knowing not everyone in the world is suffering right now."
