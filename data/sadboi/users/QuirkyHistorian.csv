I had bought some loafers from them months earlier but they were super uncomfortable. I never wore them outside my house. I knew I was outside the return date but I called and spoke to a manager and he told me to come on in. Not only did he take the unworn shoes back for an exchange, but he personally spent an hour helping me find two new pairs of shoes that felt much more comfortable than the pricey loafers. I ended up spending more than the original exchange price (so it was a win-win for that manager) but I'll never forget how nice he was. No Karen freakout needed. Just be nice to retail folks and they'll be nice back."

Then if my mom achieved something, grandma had no problem bragging to the world without ever actually saying anything positive to my mom. She also used my mother's health issues as a means of gaining sympathy from those around her while never actually lifting a finger to help out or even VISIT or call my mother when she was in hospital. I remember one time in elementary school my mom got really sick and ended up hospitalized for a couple weeks. My grandmother never once visited her the entire time she was there. Didn't call to check up on me and who was watching me and taking me to school, etc. Mind you, I had my stepfather, but it would've been nice if she showed she cared. Well, according to my aunt, grandma got up in church one Sunday and made a huge show of asking the congregation and everyone to pray for her dear sick daughter in the hospital. She apparently went on and on about how hard it was for her and how parents aren't supposed to bury their children. The old biddies ate that shit up. After church, my aunt tore her a new one about how she didn't give a damn about my mom because she hadn't even bothered to see how she was doing. Grandmother just shrugged, got in her car and went home. That bitch was pure evil."

You could try to have one last talk with him about what is obvious to everyone else. Get other family members involved if need be. Other than that, it's possibly time to drop the rope with the man.
