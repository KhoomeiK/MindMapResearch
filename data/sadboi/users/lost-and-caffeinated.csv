Accounting,fqykj83,t3_glju84,1589750078.0,"I think there are studies that show that people with unlimited PTO take about the same amount of time off as those with limited PTO but sometimes they have to be encouraged to take time off.

Working as an accountant in a service industry where we had limited PTO, some people just wouldn't take the time off until they were reminded that they would lose the hours if they didn't use them. With unlimited PTO, there's nothing tangible to lose, so unless you are really deliberate about planning time off, you risk working more on average.

I would prioritize flexible working arrangements over unlimited PTO. You'll still have time off, but it will actually go further than you realize because you won't have to take days off to deal with personal commitments."

Anxiety,fpn08a3,t3_ged0da,1588746408.0,"Actually, you are making good step by talking about it on this forum. It's good to get your worries and fears out of your head and into writing. It may not comfort you, but it may relieve some of the pressure building up in there. I would try writing in a journal if that's an option for you too.

It does sound like you are in a pretty crummy situation though. It's hard to remain calm when it seems like everyone around you is freaking out. I guess, my question at this point is, who is saying that there is bad energy or talking about the bad dreams? Is it the people in the household or someone online or out on the streets? If it's people outside of your household or online, then try to limit your exposure to them. If it's people inside the house, then you may need to flat out tell them to not mention it around you. 

By cutting that off and then giving yourself an outlet that won't talk back, that might relieve some of the anxiety that you are feeling."
Anxiety,fpmzlci,t3_ged0ul,1588745902.0,"Ha, as much as everyone is commenting on how insensitive your post is, it is exactly how half of me feels when I'm having a panic attack/breakdown. One side of my brain is freaking out while the other side is wondering wtf is happening and why can't I just get a grip. 

It's annoying.

In my case, my anxiety is the result of growing up in a stressful and chaotic environment, so my flight or fight response was turned on practically all the time as a kid. And that's how my brain developed - constantly on guard and full of fear. After a lot of therapy, I know that my anxiety attacks are for the most part irrational, but it's ingrained in my brain to be ready for attack at all times, so I literally can't turn it off.

For example: I was involved in an incident with a former boss that made me very uncomfortable, so I decided to speak with the HR Director about it. I was nervous about the conversation as I knew that the HR Director and my boss were rather close, and I was very concerned about her response. Before I went to her office though, I spent a little time giving me a pep talk (I discussed it with family and they agreed with my decision; If I didn't say something, I would regret it; I had already put in my notice, so what were they going to do? Fire me?), but as I walked up to her desk, I could not get my heart to stop pounding. I wanted to cry, I couldn't breathe, and I was shaking horrendously. I did practically everything I could think of at that moment to calm my response  (breathing exercises, mantras, moving slowly but deliberately, etc), and nothing worked! The conversation was totally fine, and the HR Director's response was very positive and encouraging, but it took me a couple of hours afterwards to calm down. 

Another way to think of it is this: A person with diabetes has to take insulin in order to control their blood sugar. Even if they are very capable of caring for their disease, they will sometimes have off days or get really sick and need medical attention. The same is true of people with panic/anxiety disorders. We do a lot to manage the anxiety and panic, but some days are rougher than others, and we need additional care as a result."

That being said, I hope this person never comes across an assault victim because he could seriously traumatize an individual with his assertiveness.

Gonzaga,fm57abu,t3_fsmjn4,1585767633.0,"Wow, that's almost exactly the choice I had to make too, except I was looking at CU - Denver. Denver is a really popular attraction just because there is so much to do, but I think it helps to determine what is really important to you in terms of your schooling and then figure out which school provides the best options for those items.

For example, how much does the actual program matter to you? Are you looking for something really specific to study? Each school may provide a lot of similar programs but the quality is going to differ between the schools. For me, I'm attending Gonzaga for the MAcc program which is ranked 25th in the nation I believe. CU - Denver offers a decent program, but it doesn't rate as high and is catered more towards online/part-time students. Since I wanted a full-time, on-campus high quality program, Gonzaga was the better choice in that regard. 

Also, in terms of location, I did make sure to visit Spokane before making a decision. I'm very sensitive to environment, so I always do a vibe check when contemplating a move to another city. I found that I liked the city a lot better than some places I visited, so it would be doable for the 1.5 years that my program will last.

They verified that the section is in the contract to require tenants to report long-term arrangements and to ensure the new person is added to the lease. Seeing that I find nothing else questionable about the contract and that I got this verification in writing, I'm not so concerned any more. 

I also did some outside research, and Washington tenant law does state that restrictions can't be unreasonable. Having the approval/additional rent clause apply to every scenario would be unreasonable, so there is a bit of a safety net there as well."

It's just so frustrating and hurtful to want relationships, to want to have a closeness with someone (especially if you can already think of someone in particular), only to find your sexuality making it incredibly complicated or difficult or even impossible.

I have a hard time not letting my thoughts turn extremely pessimistic (I'm going to die alone), but I've been trying to combat that with reminding myself that I'm not omniscient, so as much as I may feel like I'm never going to get there, that will only be true if I stop trying or remain in the same spot.

AlAnon,fimczvd,t3_f8m2pa,1582525500.0,"This sounds so completely familiar to how I felt just a couple of years ago. I didn't want to do anything that would harm the relationship that I had with my mother (she is the closest person that I have in my life), but I was desperate for some sort of help on how to make all of the madness stop.

I soon found out that there was *nothing* I could do to get her to stop her behavior. All that I was accomplishing by trying to get her to stop was exacerbating an already toxic situation that was exhausting and overwhelming me. 

The thing is, she's a grown adult who is responsible for her own life and her own actions. I'm not sure when I starting thinking her life was my responsibility, but over the years, I had somehow become so consumed by it that I forgot to take care of the one thing that I actually did have responsibility for: my own life. 

The months following after that realization were not easy. I felt sooooo guilty every time I didn't clean up after her or put up with her behavior. I definitely felt a wedge come between us, which was exactly what I didn't want to happen. That being said though, for the first time in a long time, I was actually able to deal with my own problems and issues. I started thriving at work and with my friendships, and I was granted enough space in my head to make some major career moves that I had been wanting to do for awhile.

And after all of that effort in detaching myself from my mother's life, nowadays we actually still have a close relationship. I'm just a lot happier in it. 

I'm not sure how things would go with you and your mom if you were to exercise detachment in your own life (your mom might not respond as favorably as mine), but I do think it is something worth looking into and checking out. For your own health and sanity.

Another is in a great city with easy access to internships and job opportunities but doesn't really provide the concentration or high quality program that I want.

I was able to visit one of the schools because I was visiting my family at the time, but I don't have any flexibility to go visit any the other two right now due to my job and preparing to move for school. I also can't wait too long to make my decision because of when some of the programs start.

It took me a really long time to realize that if someone wasn't willing to go at my speed and took offense to it, then he wasn't worth keeping around. If I was uncomfortable at the start, then it was unlikely that I would ever not be uncomfortable with him.

That being said, I still have those moments where I internally panic because I'm concerned that the length of time that I need to be comfortable in romantic relationships is severely limiting my ability to achieve some of the things that I want in life. I mean, I would love to get married and have kids, but I just don't know if it's going to be possible knowing how I process these things. 

It's also really difficult to explain to some of my family members who try to hook me up with people. I mean, sure, they may like the person, but my brain isn't going to take that at face value. It's going to want to interact with the individual itself before it generates some sort of reaction. One date or meet-up isn't going to cut it.

My advice is just to try it out and see how you feel. I had a doctor prescribe me SSRIs at the suggestion of my therapist because I was having such extreme anxiety reactions during my sessions, but on the medication, I could barely function. I would fall asleep at work and spent most of my weekends sleeping on the couch, and I would feel more anxiety due to my lack of usefulness.

writing,fe4dowa,t3_enlwwd,1578858185.0,"tl/dr Focus on what makes depression annoying or frustrating instead of sad or debilitating. 

I think something that is regularly misrepresented in writing about depression is how random it can be. A lot of stories will detail a horrible event which causes the character to fall into a depressed state from which they can't recover. It's so planned and gives the depression a ""good"" excuse for occurring as well as makes it some that can be overcome with a bit of time. 

In reality though, depression is much more random and is difficult to cure (or impossible for some). For example, a person who struggles with depression can have a really good day (out with friends, enjoying themselves), when bam! a switch goes off and their brain takes a tailspin into severe self-loathing and sadness. The person suddenly feels worthless and just wants to disappear at home. It's frustrating and annoying, especially considering that there was no reason for the switch, and I think if a scene is set up in the correct way, the reader will feel frustrated and annoyed when it happens. 

And if you wanted to take it further, having such events happen multiple times, even after getting help and having improvement, is a pretty accurate portrayal of depression. The whole two steps forward and one step back struggle is a very real thing with depression, so how obnoxious would it be to have your MC finally making progress in their life, only for the depression to make a sudden and random appearance for almost no reason at all?"

solotravel,fd6bqb0,t3_ejydms,1578188538.0,"I consider myself an urban hiker. I love walking around cities and towns, just to soak in the place. I usually plan at least one fun thing to do a day. It may be a touristy thing or it may just be checking out a coffee shop that looked interesting and people watching for hours. Depends on my mood and interests. 

By the end of the day, my feet are usually killing me, but that just tells me it was a good day."
Anxiety,fcrzyei,t3_eijeki,1577909205.0,"My doctor and I talk about this a lot as I am a sufferer of the ""Stress Trifecta"": Migraines, insomnia, and stomach discomfort. All triggered by stress and anxiety (fml). 

Anyway, IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) is kind of a catch-all diagnosis for someone who has stomach discomfort on a regular basis but with no sign of infection or other physical disease causing it. Sufferers of anxiety are regularly diagnosed with IBS as a result. Even if you don't get an IBS diagnosis though, it would be a good idea to discuss alternative treatments with your doctor to quell the stomach discomfort without possibly abusing your diazepams. 

Until you have your appointment though, stick to bland foods and drink a lot of water. Pepto is good if you are feeling really sick and have diarrhea. Meditation and staying in safe places can also help. I've found that walking slowly around my house has lessened my stomach discomfort specifically (gives me something physical to do for distraction that isn't too active). You have a lot of options, but it might take some time to find what works for you."
AlAnon,fcrxme0,t3_eicqsu,1577908025.0,"Sounds like you are going through a really frustrating time.

I have somewhat of a similar situation in that the Alcoholic in my life is functional in public and then a complete mess in private. Adding onto that issue is that over the past couple of years there have been some other health problems, and that has kept me from leaving outright many a time. The same thoughts always plague me: 

What kind of horrible, selfish person would leave a loved one when they are sick? And isn't alcoholism just another kind of illness? What would everyone say if I just walked away? Who would I turn to if I needed help? What would I feel if I were in their shoes? I wouldn't want someone to abandon me while I'm sick!

It goes on and on. 

There were a lot of things that have helped me become more comfortable with stepping away from the alcoholic and not beating myself up for leaving them to their own devices. Going to Al-Anon meetings was paramount just in that I have gotten a lot of hugs and encouragement during those meetings. I think over time reading and hearing everyone's stories have also allowed me to see just how twisted my views about the situation had become. 

Anyway, it's out of your control what your ex and her family and friends think of you, but you can take care of yourself and make sure that you are getting what you need. Just know that there are a lot of people out there who support you in that."
demisexuality,fcrtis5,t3_eif9y0,1577906417.0,"Oh, I feel your pain. 

Holidays in general are difficult for me for a variety of reasons, but as someone who has been single for 13.5 years, I am always a lot more aware of relationships and my lack of them during this time of year. It is (unintentionally, I know) just such a reminder of an area of my life that is severely empty and painful, an area that I know won't be easy to change. 

I wish I had some advice for you, but the best I can offer is just to let you know you're not alone in feeling this way."
AlAnon,fc3nmkh,t3_efwp67,1577394033.0,"So sorry that you've had to experience so much with your mother.

I feel your pain in regards to having a ""functional"" alcoholic in your life. My mother is very similar. Most people I have spoken to about the situation have been very dismissive about it because they just don't experience what I do, and my mother is in supreme denial about it. I mean, she could be stumbling around the house after downing a bottle and a half of wine, dropping glasses, and sick to her stomach, but if I even suggest that she had imbibed too much, then she is usually yelling at me and telling me I'm overbearing and controlling and all sorts of other horrible things. 

She's moving out of the state next month though, and I couldn't be happier about it. I've had my moments like you, where I wonder if I'll regret being so pleased to see her leaving (I mean, she's the only mother I've had and she has been a good mother in the past), but I'm trying to keep myself from ruminating over such thoughts. I mean, ultimately, it's okay for me to mourn over everything that I've lost, whether it be my childhood, or the dishes that she's broken, or our relationship, or her life, but IMO, it's not okay to feel guilty about what happens to her. She's making her choices, and there are consequences to them. I don't have any control over that, except for how much I let those consequences affect my life. 

I wish I had come to the realization that it's okay to leave my mother alone a long time ago (would have saved me a lot of grief), but man, it's not easy to let go of a parent."
AlAnon,fbyfy9g,t1_fbx0jv8,1577215920.0,"I applaud you for opening up to your brothers, and I'm glad they were receptive to you. I've told my sister what is going on, but she went into full denial mode, so that really sucked to know I didn't have at least another family member to talk to about the issues.

I've also had similar concerns about her health. My mother is nearing 70 and is hardly taking care of herself, so I cringe to think what is going on with her body right now. She's definitely had a few warning signs that her body is struggling, but she's always adamant that it has nothing to do with her drinking. This is probably one of the hardest areas for me to wrap my head around because I want to do what I can for her especially if it could save her life, but if my mother is blatantly ignoring warning signs, then she may just one day have to face the consequences of that."
AlAnon,fbye74k,t1_fbwl8ta,1577214661.0,"Thanks for your input.

I know that a lot of our issues are boundary issues, so that's definitely a major consideration during this time. What makes boundaries difficult though is that my mother currently lives in my house, so making an excuse and leaving isn't necessarily an option. I'm also in this weird transition stage in my life, so I don't have anyone who I could really escape to. This is the last Christmas my mother will be living with me (thank God!), but I still got to get through this one. 

Since my brain ruminates terribly when she is drinking, I've been thinking that I at least need to find a way to keep my mind occupied until she sobers up. Something simple like working on coloring books while listening to Frank Sinatra has done the trick in the past. Looking at my office, I could probably organize my papers. Not exactly what I want to spend my Christmas doing, but hey, it's a much more positive option than freaking myself into a stress migraine which will make me feel sick for days."
solotravel,fbweuby,t1_fbvyvwh,1577148061.0,"I agree. Houston is a major hub for food. You can find just about anything (and I mean anything) there. There is also the museum district with plenty of great exhibits.

Accounting,fbwdt6g,t1_fbuk0k6,1577147285.0,"Well...I could probably manage to finish my month end recons while in traction...

But in all seriousness, how sad is it that I've felt that nothing short of a major accident was a good enough reason for taking time off? The pressure to always be on and perform was so absolutely insane and intense that I began to think taking some me time was grounds for termination. Crazy, I know. That was just the world I found myself in though."
Coffee,fbtjtzv,t3_eec5eh,1577081584.0,"If you are willing to splurge on some specialty coffee beans, there are are a lot that have a thinner body as well as tea notes that might appeal to you. If you go to your local specialty coffee shop (not Starbucks!), they may be able to direct you in the right direction.

I use an aeropress to brew my coffee, and I would suggest that over a French press because the latter brewer usually results in a grittier coffee. For someone new to coffee though, an automatic drip machine would probably be a better choice overall as it does all of the work for you. Both aeropresses and French presses are considered manual brew methods and take a bit of finagling in order to prepare a decent pot of coffee."
Accounting,fbtinc9,t3_eebqd5,1577080261.0,"I've felt similar with my career recently. On my worst days, I would scare myself because I would have such a strong urge crash my car going 70 mph while on the way to work just so that I would have a decent excuse for not showing up.

That was a pretty eye opening moment, and I knew change needed to happen. So I sat down and tried to determine what exactly is what that I hated about my job and what it was that I would have to do to fix it. New company, new industry, new career? I eventually came to the conclusion that a change of career would be the necessary next step. I'll have to go back to school and all that jazz, but for the first time in a long time, I'm actually looking forward to something.

It doesn't sound like you have a wife or kids, so if that's the case, you have a lot of flexibility on what you can do with this situation. Don't think just because you've gone through all the school, all of the promotions, etc, that you can't go back and have a redo. It doesn't make you less of a success or weak or anything along those lines. Just do what you want. It's your life.

Then again, you may just have a shitty employer and don't need to make a major life change.

That being said, if you think you're becoming an alcoholic, it might be a good idea to check out some AA meetings. The 12-steps have been around for ages for a reason. They really do help people when they are stuck."
