There are assholes in every organization, profession, etc. Thats why I think it‚Äôs necessary that we look at the general population percentages, and that ratio against a organization‚Äôs. I am not intentionally spinning anything; perhaps it‚Äôs the circles I spent a lot of time in during my college day‚Äôs, but I had to cut a lot of ties with friends and organizations because they actively ruined lives and threatened to kill people whom didn‚Äôt agree with their politics. That‚Äôs the kind of extremism I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs on all sides of the spectrum in politics, but I don‚Äôt accept it from any party - republican or not. So I don‚Äôt take it as spinning. It‚Äôs a level of human decency in my opinion. 

‚ÄúI don't see how any progressive groups or protests demanding better workers' rights would be 'way too far.'‚Äú

I was merely saying that with VIP KID, and with every group on the internet (and the news etc), it‚Äôs merely the people throwing the biggest tantrums Or the most extremist view points that we tend to hear as they grab the most attention. I never said any more than that, as I never mentioned my own political affiliation or political attitudes, please do not assume such.

I thought you were saying such- I have just been explaining my opinion, as I thought you were looking for discourse, as you played on a public forum. This is Reddit after all. :) my apologies for not being more clear in my original post - I was sleep deprived from my week of overnight shifts so I realize my original explanation was not as thorough as it should have been, by far. I am not looking to change anybody‚Äôs opinion- just to have civil discourse, as I believe it‚Äôs important we do so when appropriate. 


To clarify:
I highly suspect that what we see is conservative individuals in online teaching - but I am curious to see if that is due to a bias in (1) whom chooses to participate in online forums (ie maybe more progressive teachers don‚Äôt participate in forums so this appears to be a conservative community by first glance At the Hutong for example), or perhaps there are other  factors - such as the fact that this job originally started out marketed to stay at home moms in the south (which surely would have been a correlation at the time - I don‚Äôt know if it still is a factor for such and political views due to how much it‚Äôs grown). That‚Äôs what I was suggesting, along side ‚Äúpeople that scream the loudest may be what we see, but I don‚Äôt know if we should take that as representative the company‚Äôs contractors as a whole without more digging‚Äù."

EDAnonymous,fqt87x8,t3_gkfhhp,1589632878.0,"I'm curious why you think that if somebody is not \*currently\* struggling, they have \*never\* struggled with their weight? Because quite frankly, everybody here has in one way or another, and that is the unifying factor. So I suggest thinking about that, as your post could be very damaging to some posting here. Of course, I understand what you are saying - that the movement, first created to empower those that fall outside of the norm, that are disempowered in such a way, has been co-opted by women that have not or minimally experienced such which must be frustrating. However, I suggest you tread lightly as such can be a hard topic to approach and draw such a concrete line In the sand.

I'm also curious why you are villinazing attractive individuals? If anything, we should be celebrating the fact that more brands are opening their markets to various shapes and sizes - it should have happened a LONG time ago. Why make it a war?

I've been over weight, I've been underweight, and now I'm a healthy weight - which for me is not giving a fuck about my weight and having a healthy relationship with food/fitness. However, when I was over weight and underweight, people were constantly telling me to embrace body positivity and body acceptance as a means to recover from my various eating disorders. Now, I am seeing posts like this, and have on Instagram received nasty messages for speaking about how loving and respecting myself and my body has been beneficial for me in the past, and continues to be, all because I am ""conventionally attractive"". Just some food for thought - because posts like this always make me wonder ""at what BMI should I be considered 'acceptable for a bodyposi movement...."" which always make me chuckle a bit... lol ;D

Again - and while I can understand why the movement must be frustrated - being co-opted often, that doesn't dismiss people whom have found it helpful in the past, or are using it as a part of their ED recovery, and being conventionally pretty or a ""normal"" or ""healthy"" weight now doesn't mean that has always been the case. So I urge you to find other ways to make your point, if you re going to do such in an ED sub, due to the reason we are all here."

I thought this at first that may be ‚Äúa thing so I opened my slots and I on minimum get 5 bookings overnight, but often more (perhaps you classify me as new though- I‚Äôve been here since September of 2019). 

I think it more so has to do with when you are willing to work. Most people are not willing to work ungodly hours of the morning so of course it will be easier to get classes at ungodly hours if the morning. But durning the ones like 6 am or 6 pm when people are naturally awake and prefer to be? It‚Äôll naturally be harder.

eating_disorders,fq76xso,t1_fq5yisw,1589142575.0,"1. So this was merely one example of many, and merely the most common of what I have seen around.... but I know there are others. I have friends (2 to be precise) that have tried to go vegetarian/vegan, and did it properly - but were unable to do so, due to medical conditions, as they ended up very ill. One end up very iron deficient and one ended up deficient very fat deficient. It happens.

2. Yeah! I know it can take a number of appearances depending on the person. :) One of my good friends, like I mentioned, surely uses it as a form of restriction - I think it's the last thing keeping her from recovering. If she has any alcohol, it's the first thing she says adios to.... but for me, it's something that I can't seem to part with and is important to me, so I think it's obvious and easy to distinguish with an quick interview/a fw questions (to mingle this with number 4 a bit lol). But yeah... I feel you! I actually very rarely bring up my veganism, unless it seems like the person wants to bring it up - the same way I treat politics or religion.

eating_disorders,fq13a7h,t3_ggequ1,1589041153.0,"I think what you mean to say is ""Veganism can be a trigger for anorexia, but is never a direct cause alone, so please stop blaming veganism, and veganism alone because it is much more complex than that"". As somebody who has been vegetarian/vegan since before their ED, I can relate to what you say; it is frustrating when people blame your ED on your lifestyle and moral choices. For me as well, it is MUCH more than a diet and about many more things than the food in front of me. So I can understand what you said in that regard. However, let me break down a few things/points/what I see as problematic/have some questions about. :)  


1. ""***...******see someone who obviously has an ED and blames their malnutrition on their vegan diet""*** While veganism alone cannot be blamed for things, many people have complicating factors that may make eating, digestion, etc. more complicated than it is for others. Nutritional education is obviously one of those, and many people- including those with eating disorders, are often not properly educated about how to go vegan, and do so properly. Like you mention - most vegetarians/vegans are in actuality chubby or end up gaining weight, as they reach for carbs before eating more sustainable forms of fat/protein/etc., simply because they aren't used to the new food groups, and the new ways of meeting the same nutritional needs. Eating disorders can also lead some to have GI issues, which when combined with the GI effects of a vegan diet can cause more GI side effects and.... bam.
2. ***""I recovered from my ED and started eating meat again""*** \- I don't think we have the right to judge people, when it comes to what works for them in their recovery. Restriction is a lot more than what's on our plate, and the mental/psychological component of restriction is just as relevant as the physical component. Perceived restriction is just as triggering as actual restoration - which is why many people struggle to be vegan if they have a history of an ED, currently struggle with one, or have a pre-disposition to one. So while I'm glad that veganism has been a healthy ethical lifestyle choice for you, I don't think that justifies us in determining how others should go about their recovery - especially since veganism is about loving all beings - and human beings are just that - beings! Eh? :)
3. ***""Nope, you cant blame veganism for having anorexia, it is your ""choice""*** ( as far as mental diseases are a choice) and most certainly not because you eat plant-based."" Can you explain this some more? I'm a bit confused, as you call Anorexia a mental disease, but mental health conditions aren't a choice- at all. Recovery from one is (to an extent... depending on your accessibility to resources etc), but nothing about having the disorder Is a choice. Can you clarify what you meant though? :)
4. ***""And every time you to try disguise your dysfunctional behaviours as veganism you make the life of people who are vegans for the animals or the environment miserable and degrade their ethical efforts. You don¬¥t have to share their believes or support them, but the least thing you can do is stop undermining there efforts!""*** YUPPPPPPP. I cannot tell you how many times this has frustrated me; when I went to ED treatment that claimed to be vegan friendly, and my nutritionist continually told me that my diet/eating targets were basically perfect but hat I just ""needed to start eating dairy' I really had to bite my tongue! What I fear however, is that the  individuals who latch onto this excuse (because that's what they're doing- they're looking for a societally acceptable excuse not to eat) will latch onto another - like a food allergy, or something else that will excuse them from eating a lot of foods - and while it's not ideal, it'll happen until they get better. That doesn't excuse it or make it okay, but I do understand \*why\* they do it, which has helped me to make peace with it..... especially since I have learned that my best friend (whom identifies as a vegan) is one of these people, which was really shocking for me."
vipkid,fq0wpvs,t1_fq0n67d,1589038597.0,"Lol. I jokingly do that with my kids who rush and make mistakes. I'll go WAITTT YOU ASK ME TEACHER BAO BAO! Then give them the wrong answer they gave me. But... with this girl, She just stops answering and literally throws a tantrum - like 3 year old I've worked with. Leaves the iPad where it is. whines, slumps onto the floor and cries, stares at me waiting for a response, then when she sees she doesn't get what she wants, throws herself onto the flood in a heap. So I'm afraid that wouldn't work with her. :/ If I say anything fun or playful at that point it kinda feeds into it, you know? I just do the normal level of ""hahahah mom bao can't give me shit for not doing my job!"" perky, and dora along without removing the demand.

TO clarify- it seems as though she just hates lessons, and has learned that throwing a tantrum gets her out of them. And that may work with other adults in her life, and if so? That's sad.... but I want to show her that in my little pathetic virtual classroom, for those 25 minutes, while she may not like them, I'm consistent and all she has to do is try - she gets stars when I see she makes a sincere effort, not when she gets things right. When she neglects to try? They get taken away. And when she throws a tantrum? No positive or negative punishment or reward - the demand just continues. Throwing a tantrum doesn't get her out of the lesson, even if it may intimidate other teachers.

Do whatever you want kid... if you make it clear that you're throwing a tantrum to escape a demand, the demand can wait (obviously outside of safety concerns or if you're threatening the safety of property, etc.) .... so guess who took all of the time they could teaching the class... all 35 minutes with a grumpy 10 year old?   


AND. [I.FUCKING.WAS.NANCY.AF.EVERY.FUCK.ING.SECOND.OF.IT](https://I.FUCKING.WAS.NANCY.AF.EVERY.FUCK.ING.SECOND.OF.IT). [I.LOVED.IT](https://I.LOVED.IT). Here's to hoping I pissed her off so much she begs her mother to not book with me............ fuck, or hers to hoping her mother doesn't like my style because I don't want to do that every class.  


Funny enough, I think other teachers have done this before, because at the 25 minute she actually got grumpy, then at the 29 minute perked up and magically knew how to read and speak much better, while before she basically mumbled sounds like a drunken sailor."

I was asking for clarification to make sure this was the best place to be posting your question, and to see if I could help you to answer anything. . I'm still not exactly sure, as all you've said this far is ""I am asking for input"", and were not clear in your above post.

I am more than happy to help, as I totally understand where you are coming from, as I also have a number of mental health conditions... as well as mast cell issues (plus the other conditions I've acquired - EDS, POTS, etc.) . So I can empathize. Doctors often times use it as a reason to be lazy in their diagnostics, or explain away symptoms they cannot find reasons for according to their often outdated or narrow training, and it hurts. It really does, emotionally, and/or physically. According to research, some conditions if anything make us pre-disposed to having mental health conditions, and the two being symbolic doesn't give them the right to dismiss our physical concerns and needs without treating them - but that's often how they act.

So if you can clarify what you'd like input on - because we can't diagnose you so I don't know what precisely you'd like input on - I'm more than happy to talk about my past experience with this, or to see if there are things in common you can bring you to your doctor to help you rule out MCAS/Mastocytosis etc. If that's what you mean? I don't know though, as instead of clarifying I instead got a rather sarcastic response about being human and typing in this forum..."

vipkid,fpjnpoz,t1_fpjjuj1,1588675261.0,"They didn't. In February, I had 50%ish percent of my schedule open, and booked 100% of whatever I opened - usually between 300-400 slots per month. Now? When I open 100% of my schedule (and I mean that literally - every. single. slot) I just barely make 300 bookings). So I am dedicating twice the time (as I leave them SN, and when they do book, they are often every other slot so I can't realistically walk away and start doing something else) for the same amount of work. It sucks...... especially since the time was never overnight before.

I personally feel as though when I'm 75% ""obnoxious Karen-y"" (but not over the top because thats just annoying to anybody), it does well, especially with certain energy levels and ages. I've had a lot of my hyperactive and littles return as regulars which wasn't the pattern I had noticed before. 

I actually just set up a Google doc, so moving forward if I ever make changes I can try to track them more objectively - I regret not doing it in the past. 

I'm just also worried, because in the past I had bronchitis and took the risk (didnt want the participation score to go down) and because of my raspy voice, got a ""low energy"" bad feedback, which VK refused to invalidate, for a reason I still cannot figure out. Nothing about my teaching was low energy, my voice was raspy - but still articulate and you could understand me. So after that experience I am extremely paranoid about that sort of thing, you know? 

Once this dies down though, much like with the red lip stick and blonde hair, I'd be curious if a few people want to get together.... and do a experiment with like 20 new kids- just 10 random ones of the same level, an even split of them Karen-ing it 100%, and 10 of them being themselves, and seeing how many come back or are happy with their performance. 

Thank you, I appreciate it. I just really need a break, and it's been rough without the social supports in place, to ""buffer"" the stress, you know? I'm a verrrryyyyy social person, so not having that has made this a very different experience. I'm not used to being up and not having people to really talk to much. I miss my friends!

Also, I never said higher income families don't crash and burn - I understand how dramatically it can impact finances, when you live a rather comfortable lifestyle, and suddenly lose that income, yet are left with the expenses. Please don't misunderstand what I am saying.


When people lose their jobs, financial commitments become a strain, regardless of the income bracket, so this isn't about ""show offs"" for me. It's more about the fact that people whom live in poverty normally struggle to get assistance, during ""normal circumstances"".  So, when there are people whom make triple digits (making it easier for them to save - something people in poverty are basically unable to do on a consistent basis...) asking for assistance that is allotted for the people in more need? It irks me. Those people largely have the ability to save for situations like these, and choose not to. 

I am saying this, also having worked with a number of these families, as a house manager, and having played a part in their finances, and errands - seeing the daily in/our their finances, as well as having friends struggle to keep food on the table, because they desperately needed assistance for income, but didn't qualify for a really absurd reason. 

Of course suffering is suffering and I am not trying to say that these people aren't suffering. However, I'm trying to say that it's frustrating that these people aren't seeing the bigger picture and that it's impacting the way that money and whatnot is being allotted in crises like these."
