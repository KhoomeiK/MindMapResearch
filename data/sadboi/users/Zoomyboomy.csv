And then he got an xbox in a competition and would let me play those games with him. Gauntlet Dark legacy ended up being my favorite game, and i still have a soft spot for it. And eventually my dad started to build his own computer, and just gave me the old one. So i guess my nerdy dad is the reason i love video games so much. Because instead of ignoring me for his cool new computer, he sat me down and let be a part of it. He never got mad at me for messing him up, or for being bad at the games I'd play with him.

AdultSelfHarm,fngddrb,t1_fngcfyh,1586928850.0,"I was very reactive to his statements. Ill try to be less reactive next time :(

It just hurts me so much when he says things like this you know? I tell him how im having a bad day trying not to self harm and hours later he texts me about how he'd be happy if his brother (also my friend and he knows that) would die. I ask him why and he tells me how they dont always get along and that his brother is being very loud in his room. And then he starts telling me how his brother is suicidal and self harms. And i guess just the context of everything else he's said to me throughout our entire friendship just made me feel attacked as well. When i first told him i self harmed he called me ""retarded"". It seemed to me he was attacking the character of shers in general. Which was reactive and a bad thing to assume i realize"
AdultSelfHarm,fngcejj,t1_fngbssi,1586928032.0,"I just don't know what to say when he starts telling me he wishes somebody else that i care for would die :(

That's probably a wise thing to do. Actually doing it will be hard with him though I'll admit. He's said many awful things to my face before this, so i guess now I'm too quick to assume he means me harm.

The main reason i offered him to live here with me is so he wouldn't have to be by his family all the time anymore. So hopefully it'll still be a good thing and we can move past this. If he ever decides to not think I'm a clown

Edit: just adding a thank you for genuine advice on our behavior. I know it may not seem like it but ill take it to heart and try to be less emotional and reactive about things he says next time"

He was a dick head and was speeding around town at over 100 mph showing off to us even though we were both terrified. He went around a curve and jumped a ditch. We flew past many trees a large flag pole, and swerved last minute avoiding a large pond. The front bottom of the car was gone from the landing and my head had cracked into the side of the window in the back seat. It was the dead of night and me and my friend had both been banged up and were hardly coherent. All her boyfriend kept saying was ""We Saw a deer. We'll tell them we saw a deer."" And then he climbed out of the car and we were pretty certain for a while that we had been ditched. Eventually the people from the closest house called 911 and they showed up and got us out. He was apparently just sitting by the car not doing anything. In shock i guess. That time sitting in his car, head bleeding, i was certain that was the end.

I usually did this so i could sneak into my parents room and sleep with them instead. But this time I walked into the kitchen and found my birthday cake. I wanted to eat it so i tried to reach for it and could only grab the corner. I ended up making the whole cake fall. I licked some of the frosting and walked back to my parents bedroom to climb in their bed. When my parents woke up, the cat was eating it, so they assumed it was her. To this day they still talk about the cat eating the cake and them having to buy a new one because of the cat. I have never mentioned this memory but have always had it.

snakes,ffzd2gr,t1_ffz8ls4,1580372974.0,Well thank you! Im glad you think so 🤗

Sneks,ffyo5zf,t1_ffyndjj,1580351081.0,"I got the idea from someone else a long while ago. Its funny, ever since i added all the clutter, i see her more often. She went from laying in her humidity box all day to actually exploring.

Looking at your enclosure definitely has made me want to break the good ole employee discount out now and step my tank decorating game up, because i love how well you tied everything together for something so functional yet beautiful!"

assaultsurvivors,ffxwe8s,t1_ffwq3ln,1580333738.0,"I didnt mean to imply men dont struggle too. Im sorry. There's just a lot less men in my life for obvious reasons (i feel uncomfortable not that they are inherently bad) and the ones in my life dont seem to open up so im not sure if they were assaulted too. When i was talking about people acting like its normal i was speaking in general not just about women.

Your 3rd point just proves to me how normalized this crap is. Like Its our responsibility to not be raped. I know you likely meant no ill will, but i think its sad that people who don't prepare for the possibility of assualt are considered foolish. It shouldn't be something anybody has to expect. And looking tough doesnt stop them. Speaking out doesnt even stop them. No matter how scary i looked, or how many people i told, it didnt matter when i was raped. He just kept doing it, and everyone around me just kept letting it happen. And somehow it was still my fault. We live in a world that places the blame on the victims, no matter the gender, and its a world im frankly tired of."

selfharm,ff5o7ns,t3_er7ckw,1579602871.0,"Tldr: this turned into a rant. Im so sorry. This might be triggering. Im sorry i shared.


So many events have exaserbated my self harm, but I believe i was born this way. I have always harmed myself to varying degrees. Ever since i can remember I've felt and acted different than normal. I was fixated on death before i even really knew what death was. I was one of those toddlers that instead of or in conjunction with crying, I would bang my head on a wall or beat myself. It wasn't anger, as i never once touched another person or even tried breaking objects. As an only child perfection was expected, and i strived to achieve such. It got me into a private school for free. The school helped me for a while, as it had some very kind teachers that made me feel special and awesome, so i sort of became normal, just a little macabre and troubled. Then i was raped by a classmate and assaulted publicly by the same classmate publicly on a near daily basis in 6th grade. People would laugh as he fondled""the weird poor girl"". I told a teacher after a long while. She tried to help me and took my side and reported it to the principal, the priest, and the pseudo school board of nuns. They told her it was handled and not to bring it up with me as it may trigger me in class or something like that. They made me sit down with the kid who abused me and told him to say sorry. That was all that was done. And then the assault of course got worse. They didn't even call my parents and report it. When i saw that these adults who i trusted wouldn't help, i decided ""well if they don't your parents won't. They'll probably just think you're a slut. You're supposed to be perfect and now you're disgusting and ruined."" The school went into full cover up mode of course, and went so far as to put my equally academically advanced cousin in a lower level class so that he couldn't witness it happen in class. Did they move my abuser? No.Suddenly i was back to hitting myself on a regular basis. I even began stabbing myself with needles. Thankfully my dad got a new job far away so we had to move. But the move also effected me negatively. As i lost all my friends, and my entire support system of teachers who cared about my education and knew i was gloomy and accepted that in my art and writing and even encouraged me to express myself constructively. I was moved to a very small public school that would not let me skip a grade despite me being about 2 or 3 grades advanced past their curriculum. The school only had barely over 100 kids grade 7th through 12th all in one building. They all hated me as i was new and weird. I tried to make the best of it at first, until suddenly my beloved older cousin died in front of my family. He was like a very close brother as we were raised together. I spiraled Even further into my darkness and stopped doing all of my homework for a month. Despite my parents telling the principal to inform the teachers of my need for a little slack, nobody was even informed why i was taking off school for a week. I had a teacher in that time frame call me a useless waste of space, as well as many other horrible things. I got my first F EVER and she announced my grade to the class. She bullied and harrassed me for the rest of my school career. I struggled in other classes but after my parents emailed them individually, they helped me catch up and were very upset the principle hadn't told them my circumstances. School got better, than worse again the second time i was sexually harassed. It wasnt as bad. At least he didnt rape me. He just touched me and made fun of me. People saw but they didnt care. The kid dropped out after multiple girls complained he did it to them though. I still had no friends. People thought i was creepy.I was shamed in english for my dark style of writing and forced to repress my forms of healthy self expression. Even my bus driver bullied me and dropped me off a mile away from my house every day despite the dangerous railroad i had to cross because she ""didnt want to waist time on me and go the long way"". Because of this i ended up being stalked by a distant neighbors farm hand who was a convicted rapist. I enjoyed dressing elaborately and strangely, and he commented often from afar at first and i just thought he was being friendly. Then he started following me in his car daily but turning at the last second instead of going down the dead end that lead to my rental house and my landlord neighbors (who was still about a quarter mile further down the road from my house). One day however he fervently tried to get me in his car and followed me past the train tracks. He began screaming at me and trying to get in front of me, so i ran into a ditch and booked it to my house. He followed on the road but thank god my neighbors were driving towards us from around their curve. As it was a dead end road to their house, they stopped their car in my long driveway. He parked his car to wait, and then they saw me burst out of the windbreak apparently. I didnt see this part but they told me they got out their car and started to go to confront him and he bailed. They called the cops and my parents. When they walked to the house i was hiding in a closet holding a pellet gun. We were informed of his previous charges, and the cops handled it from there and i was informed of nothing after i gave my report. The police followed my bus home for a single day after the incident, and my neighbor picked me up from the spot the driver dumped me every day until he died a year later. I overheard people talking about it at the market. He apparantly had taken various supplies from the man he worked fors shed, such as a cattle prod, rope, tape, some kinds of chemicals, and a shovel. I fully believe he intended to kill me or worse. I do not believe he was arrested however. I have dressed in trashy baggy clothes of dull colors ever since. I gave up on going to college at that point. I made 2 friends, one who is my current boyfriend, and one who was a toxic friend i only recently cut from my life, who would constantly threaten me they'd hurt themselves if i didn't give them all my love and choose them over my family boyfriend and health. They made me end up distant from my family until my senior year of high school. I couldn't take that place and moved to a large city in a different state. I have now grown fat and disgusting, and let my apartment go to shit as i am lazy. Im a burden to my boyfriend and can't enjoy sex. I dont think i was ever meant to be alive. Sorry for the long sob story. Im so dramatic sorry."
selfharm,ff5lfo4,t3_ergvdo,1579598625.0,Knee braces? I dont know if you can wear those in gymnastics. Otherwise just say you fell on a sidewalk. Its worked for me before. Or say you did it while shaving your legs. That one always seems to work.
selfharm,ff5l0ok,t3_eriwdo,1579597993.0,"Its worse in a way but also the same. I do it too. I've been doing it since i was toddler apparently. It can lead to some serious cranial damage if you're not careful. I have permanent headaches because of it, and once in high school i fainted while walking into chemistry, which absolutely mortified me because everyone was staring at me like i was some kind of freaky idiot. Some kid kicked me back into consciousness and the teacher yelled at me for being on the floor before realizing i hadn't done it on purpose. Basically my point is that for me it has had more consequences then cutting, but people recognize it less."
