bipolar,fnps3k3,t1_fnpqaqj,1587150977.0,Thanks but I don‚Äôt think my work is good enough to warrant commission. And I‚Äôd feel bad taking funds from anyone right now.
bipolar,fnprk5z,t1_fnpq9cm,1587150695.0,It is finished. But I‚Äôll have to find another one to do.

bipolar,fl2zsa0,t3_fm48a0,1584764373.0,"Conditioner, detangling spray, or oil in DRY hair. Do not attempt to detangle when it‚Äôs wet. Hair loses like 70% of its‚Äô elasticity when it‚Äôs wet. You will lose or break it off. Take your hair into 2-4 sections, depending on how much hair you have. Start with generous globs of product, really saturate the hair so that it feels gooey. With a wide tooth comb or brush, work from the bottom tips, up through the shafts, and finish with your roots. Keep the sections separate until you detangle each one, then brush your hair out altogether. Let the product sit in a little more, your hair will love the moisture treatment. Then wash! ü•∞"

legaladvice,fjt709s,t1_fjt5smh,1583604802.0,Not really. Apart from our building manager saying that there‚Äôs nothing he can really do. Is there a way we can not pay rent since we‚Äôre dealing with all of this either? Or would that also get us blacklisted?
legaladvice,fjt5154,t1_fjt4qf3,1583604177.0,A friend who comes over and has stayed the night wants to put a camera over top of our doorway to record all the hallway nonsense. Would this be a legal/good thing for us to do?

These are just the two most recent I happened to save.

FemaleHairLoss,f6qkten,t3_doopu6,1573079504.0,"I personally am not using their regrowth serum, I am only using the shampoo, conditioner, leave in, and mask and I will never go back to any other products. 

My friend however is using their growth serum and has been seeing amazing results. It's just a matter of doing the routine every night. My friend did an in person appointment and said the staff was super helpful and made her feel very comfortable."
