Paul’s reaction is also very convincing, I can’t find the full version, but he sound genuinely shocked.

Here’s the stabilized version https://youtu.be/3ZGH8J3RssI

A believer understands that God is above all, infinite power is at his doing. A believer knows that if they continue to sin then hell awaits them. Nobody has authority over God, and the believer knows that God’s judgement is perfect. Jesus was sent here so that we can cleanse ourselves from sin, he was the ultimate sacrifice and blessing to mankind. Humans can cleanse their sins by asking for forgiveness and repenting, which eliminates hell as their destination.

It’s not like everyone is doomed, we have the choice of sinning but we also have the choice to be forgiven, it goes both ways. Good and bad, these qualities equate to everything. No sin is greater than the other, no matter how inhuman it is. Everyone has the choice of forgiveness at any moment."

It messed my mental health up, and as a result I got depersonalization and derealization disorder (both are similar and can be triggered by weed). It made me feel cut off from reality, and they would come in episodes every day. 5 months later I’ve recovered for the most part, some days I’ll feel disassociated. After my recovery I had bad anxiety, depression, daily suicidal thoughts, which could or could not be caused by the disassociation.

As of now I battle with anxiety and sometimes I still feel depressed. I will most likely never do any mind altering substances again, especially since I’m young. I may possibly try it again in my 20’s or 30’s. I’ve never dealt with these issues before, and I guess marijuana triggered my mental decline. 

I’m alright with people doing it, just because me and other people had bad experiences doesn’t mean that I think others shouldn’t do it. However, I hope people get a better awareness of depersonalization disorder and I hope they know that weed can trigger it. It’s scary to feel like you’re in a dream and everything feels unreal."

The Quran itself claims that the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel were revealed to Moses, David, and Jesus. That must mean that these scriptures are holy 

Torah - ""We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers,"" (Sura 2:87).1

Psalms - ""We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him: we sent inspiration to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes, to Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the Psalms,"" (4:163).

Gospel - ""It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong),"" (3:3).
Also, ""And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah,"" (5:46).

You claim the Bible is corrupted, but according to Allah, no man can change his words or revelations.


""Rejected were the messengers before thee: with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs, until Our aid did reach them: there is none that can alter the words (and decrees) of Allah. Already hast thou received some account of those messengers,"" (6:34).

""The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfillment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all,"" (6:115).

""For them are glad tidings, in the life of the present and in the Hereafter; no change can there be in the words of Allah. This is indeed the supreme felicity,"" (10:64)."
