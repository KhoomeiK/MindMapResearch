oneplus,ey8qeay,t1_eof23u7,1566925955.0,My minus volume button clicks but doesn't work functionally in lowering the volume is this also the result of Android pie? Cuz I just got this thing like literally 5 days ago and that is the only thing not working. Like I can only lower the volume button if I increase the volume and manually decrease the volume through the digital slider. O already did the clear cache and scheduled power methods and nada.

StarWarsCantina,eofhac7,t1_eajwooa,1558534420.0,In terms of character developement I don't like Rey two rewatch the original trilogy and prequels heck even Ezra despite his annoyance has more development than Rey does.
StarWarsCantina,eofh48s,t1_eajjijp,1558534293.0,How much train Luke has compared to Rey? Did Like won his first match with Darth Vader? Did Rey lost an arm? Let me ask you something what do you constitute as a Mary Sue? Anakin was a chosen one yes but he still had to train and lost to dooku. So explain to me...how is Rey not a Mary Sue again when barely given any lessons in the ways of the force or Jedi culture?
