relationships,flmwf2x,t1_flmwapm,1585299519.0,"Thank you, that's a very great reply. And yeah it's probably one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I really needed to cause down the line, it would have gotten even worse.


I think I'm hoping for his sake that the spark comes back. Cause I feel bad almost leaving him hanging like this and him having all the feels and me having none.

Everyone keeps telling me that it'll be hard but eventually, he'll move and life goes on but idk if will move on and that scares me. I feel selfish"

therapy,fh2rjs8,t3_f15a68,1581259963.0,"So, I had this similar problem for many years, around the same age as you too.

And for so many years I never realized why.
Now I'm 22 and recently discovered the concept of hypersexuality as a result of sexual abuse and I cried.
It explained so much.


I would suggest you watch YouTube videos on it too and please try to get help through a therapist

Take care"
depression_help,fh2q25m,t3_f18t8p,1581259357.0,"As someone who has been sexually assaulted, this was hard for me to read.
But I still read through it.

And even tho I don't want to, I can understand where you're coming from.

The fact that you realize that you may have been pushy and feel guilty about it means you have a conscience. Please don't take that lightly.
Use this newly found self awareness and trust me, you will be fine.

You are good. Change is always possible."
