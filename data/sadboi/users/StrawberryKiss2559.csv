“A minute of loud talking can generate more than 1,000 coronavirus-laden droplets that linger in the air for 8 minutes, new research shows”


https://www.businessinsider.com/loud-speech-coronavirus-droplets-study-2020-5

Think of all the drunk people standing inches from each other’s faces and talking loudly over music. Think about karaoke bars where there’s always someone belting it out on stage. Think about dance floors where everyone is singing along to music or just laughing loudly. 

From the article:

That's consistent with a recent CDC analysis of a coronavirus outbreak at a choir practice in Washington state. Of the 61 attendees, 33 tested positive and another 22 developed suspected cases.

""The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization,"" the CDC report said.

The new study found that droplets emitted via speech shrink to between 20% and 34% of their original size after they're released into the air. That slows down the speed at which they fall to ground, meaning they can remain in the air for several minutes."

If they want to argue, say it’s not a big deal, it’s exactly like one of our other policies: “no shirts, no shoes, no service”. It’s the same type of rule. 

If they still want to argue, say the same thing again. “It’s store policy.” Look away. Show no emotions, don’t explain why, don’t argue, don’t get angry. Only say “it’s store policy”. People hate when they can’t get a rile out of you. They’ll move on eventually (or wear a mask). 

Every place has policies and every place has the right to refuse service. 

For example, you go drink at Trudy’s. You’re allowed 2 Mexican margaritas per day, even if you took 5 hours to drink them. It’s their policy, there’s no arguing about it. There’s nothing to argue about. No one gets to break the rules because ‘merica."
