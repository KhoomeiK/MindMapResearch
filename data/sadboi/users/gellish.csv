I hope you’re doing a bit better by now. I’m sorry that happened to you and in my opinion, your FP is kind of a dick for not bothering to even reply to your texts. 

I’m 23 and I understand many of the things you mentioned, if you ever need to talk, message me and hopefully we can vent through this hell that is a quarantine."

I'm clean now; and music, movies and the things I love have helped a lot. 

I hope you know your daughter will be okay, I can't imagine how much it hurts to see her like that but just be there, it's the best thing. I know so many people who wish that their parents were there for them when they were teenagers.

Just because you have BPD traits , it doesn't mean you'll have all. I understand how scary it is but if it really upsets you, I recommend not reading and instead asking your doctor.

The scene itself kinda makes sense, Carol is still Kree, she doesn’t understand where she is or what’s happening. 
However, people calling her a villain or stuff is completely irrational based on the fact many MCU characters have done similar or worse things and they don’t get that hate, per example: Rocket & Drax who are thieves, Clint Barton killing people left to right in Endgame, Loki doing what he does, etc.  (not hating on the characters of course, just a comparison of character who didn’t get this amount of hate even when they did worse things)"
