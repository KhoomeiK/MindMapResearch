The fact that you want to communicate shows that you are taking steps to try and better things - which is really positive.
It’s okay if words don’t come to you straight away. Sometimes it’s really difficult to articulate the way you feel. Plus you’re trying to process all these feelings. 

Perhaps rather than writing the final draft straight away, write things down that you want to say that do come to you, then leave it, go to sleep that night. Come back to it the next day and write things down or take things out and keep doing that until you have something that you’re happy with. If you can’t find the words then you could always include film references, song lyrics, dances or metaphors like my garden one above to try and give examples of how you feel. 

It might not feel like it right now but you’re on the right path to getting a better life for yourself by putting these boundaries in place and communicating with your loved one how you feel. Hopefully your partner will also communicate with you in a healthy manner and you grow together. If not then they aren’t ready to accompany you in life yet. 

I can’t tell you enough how worthy of love and good, healthy relationships you are.

BPD,flx36zn,t3_frpokm,1585573917.0,"I think it’s not necessarily your reaction to anger that needs to change but your partners way of expressing their anger, particularly when they are around you.

It makes sense that after having been in an abusive relationship for 7 years, you would be fearful of outward displays of aggression to deal with anger. 

I was going to say about therapy for your ptsd but perhaps you could do some reading around survivors of domestic abuse/dealing with PTSD whilst we’re in quarantine? 

Someone who loves you truly will understand that it can take time for you to rebuild your self-esteem, resilience and confidence - which means you’re not scared to have your own opinion and speak out for yourself. 

That should never be used against you.


I want to say that you have to be careful with people and telling them that you’ve abused in the past because some people will use it to try and test your boundaries to see whether you’ll accept them taking out their shit on you. It’s important to make clear that you won’t be having someone disrespect you ever again. You are worthy of love.

Work on yourself and be kind to yourself because you are worth every effort. 

Picture this... You are a beautiful garden, growing endlessly. People can visit you but you have to give them permission to past through the gate. You choose who visits. A special person can reside with you if you choose but if their presence stops you growing or they damage any part of you, they do not deserve to be there with you and you have the power to eject them out of your garden of growth and out of your life.

Is it possible for you to get away for a little while somewhere?
I don’t know if I’m misreading the situation but I feel a bit uncomfortable about the way your partner is reacting to you during your difficult times. 
Getting mad at you is not going to help your mood improve and will likely make things worse.
Support, compassion and true care are needed and encouragement to relieve yourself from your thoughts in the least harmful way possible. 
How can you be yourself if that is so overtly not allowed for fear of displeasing your partner - to me this feels all wrong for you. 
Not saying that you should have the right to be abusive to someone every three weeks but you should certainly be able to talk through the problems presenting themselves in your head with someone who you are in a relationship with.

I hope you can get support and let out some of the pressure. You shouldn’t be walking on egg-shells in a healthy relationship. 

How about calling one of your friends or family or a crisis line for a listening ear?

BPD,fbdd9eg,t3_ecpaxx,1576758276.0,"Wow.  Definitely not. That is very invalidating and the last thing that a therapist should be doing. 
Also you don’t have to have been through any trauma, I’m pretty sure that depression or detachment alone could make someone feel suicidal. 


It’s good that you are having therapy but the therapist also needs to know that what they said made you feel like you were being compared to other people and your experiences were being minimised and your feelings invalidated. Tell the therapist. They need to check themselves and become present to hear you and help you heal.


If they get defensive then that is a toxic environment for you to heal in and you need to find a different therapist."

It seems harsh that they have blocked you and changed and of course this would make your mind go into a spin as it’s massively triggering for you. Whatever their reason, their actions speak volumes and they are not able/willing to engage.

In a way what you’re doing is self-harming because you keep going to someone who will reject you - and you know that this will happen but you keep putting yourself on the line to be hurt.

It’s time to give yourself the care and compassion that you need and reach out to people who are able to meet your current needs without you feeling worse about yourself. 

You’re not a band person for doing this. At the same time you have to take responsibility for your actions and realise that you are unwell at the moment and need help.

It’s still trauma.
It’s affected you. 
Not having worked through things/having some learnt skills and methods to get you through can make dealing with it on your own very difficult and it’s no surprise you are coping with ways you know how.
Regardless of how much trauma you had, it still takes it toll. Even if you had more trauma you would probably question its validity because somewhere along the line people have invalidated the way that you present your pain instead of helping you find ways to deal with it. 
If you can’t get a therapist, get on waiting lists and help yourself in the meantime by learning some skills to help you in those moments instead of cutting or doing other things that hurt yourself more in the long run. 
These could be some of the following 
• count backwards from from 200 (in 7’s or 3’s to make it more challenging if needed)
• tense all the muscles in your body from feet to head or reverse 
• write down feeling and then tear them up
• meditate for 5 minutes
• uses your senses 5 things you can see, 4 you can hear, 3 you can feel, 2 you can smell, 1 you could taste.
• phone a help line and talk
• come here and vent (well done for doing so and writing about how you feel even though it’s difficult)
• read/listen to a book on something you enjoy
•watch a movie/YouTube
•paint draw scribble sketch craft make create something with your hands. It’s doesn’t have to look good, just serve the purpose of releasing energy at that time. 
•get a skills workbook 
•go for a walk/run or do some yoga and hold those stretches. 
•stroke or care for an animal. 

I know you may think pfft as if that will help but try using them instead of harmful coping mechanisms and find out for yourself what works for you. 

I’m sorry that you feel so alone in this. We are here and we understand that getting through some days are hard. There are no magic answers just some things that can help on your journey. 
Please try and get some support for yourself from your doctor/ community mental health team or charities. Your pain is valid and you deserve to be heard, work through your pain and live a healthy and happier life.

I’m slightly concerned that the psychiatrist would advise you to see your mums therapist friend - this is actually quite unethical in itself because your mum knowing the therapist would likely change the client/therapist dynamic and may have made it harder for you to open up. 

I’m glad that you are not seeing that therapist anymore and I’m really sorry that you had that experience.

Honestly, there are some great therapists out there who will act with ethical conduct as they help you find ways to help yourself. 

It’d be a shame if that one bad therapist got in the way of you actually accessing treatment for your BPD.

People will have a reaction to the situation, it takes time for them to process it and your actions do affect those around you. 

I know what you’re saying about those different sides of you when you switch but ultimately peoples own well-being means that sometimes they can’t keep accepting negative actions and/or behaviour. 

This is even harder if people don’t see you making some effort to work on those behaviours because they see you hurting and don’t know how to help but it’s on you to get help. 

As hard as that can be when you’re feeling so low already, what’s the alternative?

Sometimes you have to be vulnerable and open for your relationship to deepen.

May I ask, was it the psychiatrist who referred you to this therapist?

Are you aware if the therapist has had any experience in treating or recognising BPD?

That is not how a friend behaves or communicates with you. 

Address it directly and say no this isn’t me bitching, my responses are based on factual things that have happened and are a normal and rational response within the appropriate range.

It seems this person is rather short-sighted and sees you as your disorder rather than a whole person. 

Oh you’re always stuck indoors // oh no actually yesterday my boyfriend and I went for a lovely walk to xyz and my friend and I went out to here the day before, or I actually have plans with my friend on Saturday etc. 

In work environments, if they are constantly ‘negging’ you it’s actually a form of bullying/emotional abuse. 

I don’t know how long you’ve been friends but sometimes relationships devolve into abusive interactions if the appropriate boundaries are not in place. When we are ill, it’s sometimes difficult to advocate for ourselves, however, you definitely need to address this and let this person know that you’re uncomfortable with how they are talking to/about you. 

I would never minimise a person or try to make them feel bad about their illness or try and invalidate their responses. 
I mean, even if you totally had a delusional episode, there are ways to go about talking and helping you through - that’s what a friend would do.

Sounds like a good idea if you can access services that will help you. You seem to have overcome a lot and life with BPD seems to be one of perseverance through unrelenting thoughts/feelings.

I struggle with sh and a demonic troll who lives in my brain and sometimes gets very loud so I know it isn’t easy constantly fighting those voices and I don’t say it lightly but it can help set you and your negative inner voice apart.

And what’s true? 

Even if you’re fat, work in retail and don’t have a secondary education those things do not make you any less of a human being. You are of value to the world - flaws, bumps and all experiences included. 

We can’t all fit into the perfect box that society has put there for us and made us feel inadequate if there is any diversion from. You’re experiences have hurt you and that pain is valid and very real. Of course you deserve compassion in dealing with it and help when you can’t manage it all. 

Being a human being is about feeling things and experiencing the world we live in. It’s fucking up sometimes. Going to the bottom getting back up. Questioning is it fucking worth it!?? 

I don’t know. I’m just saying, wherever you’re at now in life, if it’s not sitting right with you then something’s gotta change. For you. And you can do it. 

Growing up is like learning a lot of social norms, how to feel, how to act, modelling behaviour. If you’ve been around abuse, neglect, addiction then it’s kind of how you see the world. That guy you were with, no offence but he sounds like he has got his own shit going on and you don’t need that in your life. 
You ARE WORTHY OF LOVE, RESPECT AND COMPASSION at the very least.

Obviously I don’t know your exact situation and history but I’m guessing you’ve been through hard times and yet here you are. 

Sometimes the most rebellious thing you can do is actually give a shit about yourself and take time for self care.

When you get those thoughts/visions/judgements are you able to challenge them by speaking up for yourself like you are a greater being who has your best interest as the important thing? 

Those judgements often come from abusive people we’ve had in our lives. Like somebody calling you fat has no nurturing value. That’s not motivating and it won’t help you be happy and healthy. 

You may not feel it but you are strong, you have overcome things by yourself that can be difficult for anyone.

Just wondering if you have an external source of support that you feel you can be honest with, like a therapist, support worker or doctor?

If not, it’s worth reaching out to your GP and asking what services you can access because you are dealing with a lot of emotions/stresses and are using coping mechanisms that are harmful in the long run. Hopefully they will put you in touch with the local community mental health team or a crisis team.

Back to what you we’re speaking about with your boyfriend - being young and kind of indoctrinated into this mans way of living is perhaps making you feel like this is the only way you can perceive living a life.

Yes it’s hard work but you are so strong for dealing with all that on your own and you can and should get support from your fellow people (us BPDers) and counsellor/therapist etc.

The main priority right now though is getting some support for where you’re at now so that your days become better. 

I’m sorry this has been so long.

Just know that there are people who care about you and there’s so much that can change in your life. Looking back you’ll be so proud that you reached out got the help you needed and started to reinvent yourself, on your own terms, doing what you want, with people in your live that are of value to you and who value you. 

Good luck my friend.

BPD,euqlzvn,t3_ch80xi,1563981139.0,"Ooh yep I hear that one too.
No expiration on the offer to DM so whenever you like. 
Hope you get to enjoy some time with your kids during the holidays that feels lighter for you.

BPD,euqksw3,t3_ch80xi,1563980466.0,"Yes it helps here to see that there are people going through similar and also to remind each other that we are doing our best and to provide each other with support where needed.

I too find it difficult asking for help when I need it and have also been rejected when I have asked for help. 

I won’t pretend to know exactly what you’re going through but you can dm me. 

I don’t always respond straight away but I will respond. 

Xxx"
BPD,euqddt0,t3_ch80xi,1563976114.0,"I hear you on this and your words are very clear. 

It does feel shitty that you’re always a support for people but when you need them, they aren’t there for you. That’s can hurt. 

Perhaps you could let people know that you need support or find a source of support for yourself outside of your circle of family or friends? Support group online/in person, therapy, hobby?

I know that you feel guilty about it but you do need care and support too, it’s perfectly okay to ask for something when you need it and if people fall short around you, it’s okay to go and seek support elsewhere before you start leaning on unhealthy crutches to get you through. 

I know this doesn’t help much but I just wanted to say that your message resonates with me and everything will work out in the end but you do need to put yourself first. 

Like that aeroplane metaphor - you’ve got to put your own mask on, because if you don’t, you’ll pass out and boooom you won’t be able to help anyone. 

With love xx"
BPD,eukds1f,t3_cgdzte,1563886935.0,"I’m sure people have experienced similar things, however it was your experience that you have to process and live with and that is the most important thing here. 

Your feelings around it are valid and worthy of exploration so that you can find peace mentally. 

I’d recommend talking about it with someone trained in sexual abuse/incest. 

Hugs x"
BPD,eugfk1s,t3_cgdzte,1563806860.0,"I should think so, especially if it was perceived as traumatic in some way. 

Even though sexual exploration between children is normalised if involved parties are all pre-pubescent (I think my psych said about 9). 

However it could still be considered traumatic if it’s affected somebody, even if it’s deemed generally acceptable."
BPD,etwrnm3,t3_cdw0wv,1563282146.0,"Definitely, a lot of people don’t like it when you put boundaries in place and won’t take their shit anymore... cue the selfish/harsh/self-centred comments. 

It’s definitely the good healthy thing for you to do though and you are at a bare minimum worthy of respect, consideration and care just as much as anyone. 

Xx"
BPD,etwq74v,t3_cdw0wv,1563280881.0,"NTA. You’re putting boundaries in place to protect yourself (which is actually really healthy) and also putting boundaries in place to say that you won’t allow people to disrespect you without consequence (also really healthy and better for your mental health in the long run). 
Asking friend A to un-invite B and Boyfriend does put friend A in the middle of the situation. I understand that you want support in the situation but I don’t know the dynamic of A and B’s relationship to outrightly say that she should un-invite them. However you can put your own needs first. 

Perhaps you could just say to friend A - I’m going to pass on the event because I want to remain healthy but I appreciate our friendship and your invitation. 

If they truly care, then they will want you to take care of yourself first and foremost. 

Keep on with those boundaries, it’s absolutely the right thing to do."
BPD,etwo51r,t3_cdsv4k,1563278939.0,All the time
BPD,etlg1f3,t3_cc9q0l,1562935314.0,"Well it sounds like you’re committed to making things work and have good intentions for your relationship going forward, I’m sure you’ll get there with that focus. 
Wishing money into your lives x"
BPD,etlfg2g,t1_etlf2zx,1562934780.0,"Yeah, i know that can be an expensive option. I don’t know if it’s available where you are but there is Relate in the uk. I think they still offer sliding scales of rates based on income if you are in the UK, if not maybe you could search where you are, or save up and just go for one session?
Good luck all the same"
BPD,etlezvz,t3_cc9q0l,1562934369.0,"How about speaking about it with an unattached external source, like a couples therapy thing? Sometimes it’s hard to recognise our own behaviour but also, and no disrespect to your girlfriend, other people can try and warp the situation and use our mental illness against us. 
It’s worth hashing this out in a safe space if you both can’t let it go and want to move forward without resentments/misunderstandings building up.
Maybe both of you have had very valid experiences in that situation but your perceptions of it are different - that’s okay. 
Hope you find a resolution. X"
BPD,erh2xbk,t3_c22624,1560865762.0,"Flashcards? 
Doing Q&A’s?
Get a time extension and/or ask for other help (being in a room on your own or whatever helps you) 

Go through a your material and write out the information you need to know. Takes a bit of prep but if you can do this and have someone to go over the questions and answers with you it can help, rather than just reading and reading and reading. 
On the morning of your exam, go in there knowing that you will do your best with the knowledge you have. 

Good Luck ⭐️"
BPD,erfoddm,t3_c1uefi,1560813552.0,"Hey there fellow bpder, I know that you’re not attention seeking and must be in a considerable amount of pain to be wanting to end things. I’m so sorry that the past few months have been difficult and that you’ve had to face things in your life that have made it seem so unbearable lately. 
It gets hard sometimes and seems there no end to the very real suffering we experience on a daily basis, it’s hard for people not in that situation to understand. That’s why talking this through with people can help you to stay another day, and another after that with some help from people who do get it.
I urge you my friend, please reach out to someone close by. I’m guessing you’re in America but could be mistaken - could you go to the emergency hospital or call the police now and tell them your plan. 
People should be taking you seriously had you have a plan of action but please show yourself some compassion and get some help instead, pretty please?

http://suicidehotlines.com/national.html

I know it feels really long but 6 months is not much time to get through difficult times, especially because you hadn’t had the help you need. 

Please my friend, I want you to get help because I care about you and want you to  just stay a bit longer, give help a try and see how you feel. 

If you’re in another area I can try and find help for you, or I can call on your behalf if you tell me where you are. 

X"
BPD,equvpij,t3_bzonqn,1560336381.0,Yes
BPD,eqpan5x,t3_bz06zw,1560197639.0,"That’s good advice, also have you got anyone you can talk to about this urge? 
A therapist or do you have a work programme that gives you access to counsellors etc? 
Could it be self-sabotage? 
Or are there circumstances around you that could be triggering in some way? 
Definitely think things through before making rash decisions but like the above said, know that you have the power to choose some options. 
Either way, it may help you to talk it through with an external source at this stage so you can address what’s going on. 
X"
BPD,eqo9n6f,t1_eqo84jw,1560185912.0,"Kindly received, thank you. Thank you for sharing a part of yourself. Thank you for working on you and what an inspiration that is to others. BIG HUG  and love straight back at you xx"
BPD,eqo4rxm,t3_byxxga,1560184090.0,"You are worthy of unconditional love.
It sounds that after everything you have experienced in life, you are doing the best you can to try and help yourself. I’m so proud of you, for feeling so deeply, living in a world that’s painful sometimes but for being the best advocate for yourself. All of these things that you are doing to try and better yourself are hard work but so worthwhile. 

You know what the other option looks like  but you stay, you fight, you care, you love, it’s hard but you deserve so much credit for that. Seriously. Well done for living through the mental torture and still having it in your soul to love so deeply and care about others. 

YOU ARE ENOUGH.

Someone worthy of your love would not make you feel otherwise. 
As the previous commenter stated, you should have been met with praise and encouragement (flowers) because someone who loves you, wants the best for you and wants you to be happy. 

To me it sounds like this guy is not currently capable of giving you what you need, even if he was to text you back now and say that he wants to get back together - what is he going to add to your life right now with his behaviour in conflict with your need for validation and stability so that you can concentrate on working on yourself.

I’m saying that because YOU are your priority right now. 

I’m sorry to say this but I really don’t think he would be the best addition to your life. 

Please don’t give up on yourself, you’ve come so far and through so much, you absolutely do deserve to be happy and healthy and you will eventually find someone who will love you unconditionally and who will be worthy of how deep your love is for them. 

You’ve got this. Keep going. Stay strong. With love x"
BPD,eqnxbw5,t3_byz9w8,1560181408.0,"Wow, that’s not for you to feel degraded in any way, he sounds desperate and severely lacking boundaries! That’s more a show of his character than anything to do with you. Tell him that’s what sex workers are for, not people who you have had intimate relationships with in the past. Also to get some basic fucking respect and decency before contacting you again."
BPDmemes,eqmjyyw,t3_byrsau,1560164040.0,Thanks for giving up your time and making sure people are safe as can be on here ⭐️
BPD,eqdsm34,t3_by63vd,1559994452.0,"Oh I know, it’s pretty much set up so that unless you’re at the worst point, they don’t want to know. The whole system is massively flawed. I’ve had to chase my psychiatrist to follow through on things and I’m still waiting for treatment after being diagnosed last year!

I forgot to mention that I also took someone in with me who I had lived with for 7 years so that is a great idea (I felt like because it was an external source, they might listen to them more than me who they also may have presumed diagnosed myself on the internet) so that can certainly help.
I quite literally dealt with my own stuff for about 15 years with them just saying it was depression and anxiety, until I came across the criteria for bpd in an article I was reading and BAM, I knew it, it finally fitted together. 
When I went to cmht, I also took someone with me, I feel like they just try and for you off otherwise and I have a witness and can fact check what they said with what I heard. 
Hope you get some where with them. Xx"
BPD,eqdpsdg,t3_by63vd,1559993308.0,"Ah okay, in that case, you will definitely have to be persistent and insistent that you need to be assessed by your local community mental health team for bpd. 
My doctors would not forward me until I ended up in crisis but even after being referred to the cmht, I still had to be the one to say, I think I have this and I need to be assessed. 
Don’t give up, if one doctor won’t refer you, see another one and in some counties I think you can self refer. 
Trying to access services is shockingly difficult, keep going for yourself though. If you need a hand finding your local team let me know. 
Good luck, hope you get the ball rolling soon. Xx"
BPD,eqdoayh,t3_by600i,1559992669.0,"Hi, this sounds like a triggering event for you and one in which your concern and well meaning were in the right place. 
It’s okay to feel like you do after going through that. 
Pretty frustrating not to be heard so that’s understandable too, I’m with you on that. 
Thanks for your concern for another human being and for also calling in others to persuade him to go hospital because he was too (insert sarcastic comment here) to listen to you. 
I don’t think you’re the one that needs to feel shit about this situation but I can understand why you do. 
Perhaps when you have both calmed down you could talk about what you expect from each other to keep things healthy.
Take care of yourself xx"
BPD,eqdn0v5,t3_by63vd,1559992094.0,"Hey, what country are you in?"
BPD,eq9z7wf,t3_bxvo5z,1559921412.0,"This is unhealthy for both of you. It would be better if you can take care of each other in these moment, like your natural instincts lead you to do. Maybe lead with kindness and when you give it to your girlfriend and she sees how’s helpful it is, she will learn through experience that being kind to each other when you’re in need feels better for both of you. 
Tell her what you need and explain why icing you out makes you feel worse. 
This behaviour is probably learned from being raised by a narcissist, so having your girlfriend experiencing the positive emotions that are instinctive for you might change this whole dynamic when you’re going through troubles. 
We all deserve to be heard, especially by those we share our lives with. 
Can you have a conversation when you are on good terms about what you need in those moments and what she needs from you?"
