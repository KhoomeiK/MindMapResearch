spiders,facxvva,t1_facxtmn,1575949717.0,It is welcome to be an awesome spider in a different establishment that is not my home 🙂
EatingDisorders,facnkio,t3_e89y2v,1575943063.0,I’ve opened up to my therapist about my purging many times and expressed a lot of concerns about my eating disorder. I’m not thin. I saw her today for the first times in a couple months (having a total meltdown about career stress) and she complimented my weight loss as I was leaving 😐
Blooddonors,f3e36or,t1_eu40kxj,1570855813.0,Long time update but I FINALLY donated successfully yesterday - used an outside vein and a pressure cuff. I only have a small faint bruise from where the needle went in. 😊
Blooddonors,eu4fhlq,t1_eu40kxj,1563452209.0,Yes that makes sense! The bruise has definitely showed up this morning so it’s probably a good idea we stopped because the whole crook of my arm is black and blue. I will try again next time 😊
Contrave,essv9o3,t1_essv5zp,1562258207.0,Thanks for this 😊
Bedbugs,erxiok2,t1_erxikr8,1561385766.0,I went to a fruit market yesterday so maybe I picked something extra up while I was there. That’s a relief though (still a good excuse to wash my bedding today) 🙏🏼
Contrave,eqq9as4,t1_eqq96a9,1560215502.0,"That’s so interesting, thank you for sharing! I’m starting Contrave this week (if my pharmacist gets it in) and I’m hoping to have a drink with friends later this month so I will be sure to take it slow."
Contrave,epqas8q,t1_epqamaj,1559402651.0,Thanks! I’m glad to hear quitting cold turkey didn’t have any negative side effects for you (but sorry Contrave didn’t work out)!
Contrave,epevkb7,t1_epevgmc,1559187617.0,What side effects were you experiencing?
Contrave,epepwoq,t1_epelufg,1559185618.0,"Thanks! I’m hoping Contrave works well for me (both mood and weight).

I hate lucid dreams so fingers crossed that doesn’t happen for me :)"
