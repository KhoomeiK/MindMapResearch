schizoaffective,fr2janh,t3_gmag28,1589838281.0,"I'm sorry to hear that your brother is struggling. We can't confirm if your brother is schizoaffective because I think most of us aren't professionals and diagnoses don't come from posts. Everyone's experience is different. When things went south for me, I saw a psychiatrist to help figure out what was wrong and consider different treatments like medication or inpatient. I go to therapy regularly and participate in group therapy to connect with people who can relate to what I'm going through. When things got dangerous, I went to a psych hospital and got treatment in a safe place. There are lots of options for those who want to recover but you can't make someone want to recover, nor is it your responsibility. If you think he's a danger to himself or others, it might be a good idea to bring him to an emergency department. I hope things get better for him. He's lucky to have someone like you who cares about him."
schizoaffective,fqtlre3,t3_gktlxk,1589641466.0,"I really relate to your post. I only experience paranoid delusions and mood episodes, and I'm relatively high functioning on medication. I always feel like I'm not schizoaffective enough compared to what I see others go through. I think it's really hard to have a mental illness, regardless of the label or others' experiences, and it's great that you're self aware and continuing to question and advocate. Not sure if this was coherent, but thank you for sharing this. I've been feeling lonely in this, and reading this helped."
schizoaffective,fps2rct,t3_gex5cf,1588866495.0,"I definitely relate to this! I'm pretty high functioning too and my family doesn't really take my disorder completely seriously so it's easy to slip into the mindset of ""there's nothing wrong, all those episodes were flukes."" But then I'll miss a couple days of medication and unravel and question everything all over again. I try to remind myself that my therapist/psychiatrist wouldn't tell me I'm schizoaffective unless they had sufficient reason. Outside perspective can be helpful."

schizoaffective,fokaxkr,t3_g7wy9g,1587838667.0,"Hey, sorry to hear you're having a rough time. Some things that have been helpful to me/that I've heard are helpful:

- having a strong relationship with psychiatrist and therapist, lots and lots of communication
- having a support network of friends and family
- group therapy to connect to people who understand the most
- staying on top of bare necessities (meds, sleep, diet, physical activity)
- practicing self-compassion

The last one has been a bit hard for me, but I try to remind myself that even though being schizoaffective makes some things harder/impossible to do, I'm in a much better place than I was a year ago and the life I have now was worth the effort."

schizoaffective,fmtycs3,t3_fxe9os,1586381197.0,"Even though I'm doing relatively well right now, I still think of myself as having a disability because if I didn't have these therapies and accommodations, I would not be able to function. I have to take medication, avoid certain stressors and see my provider regularly just like many people with physical disabilities. Accommodations at my university help put me at an equal level as someone without a disability."

NEU,fkzetvc,t3_flkna1,1584669335.0,"Hi, I'm a second year here. There are plenty of opportunities to build a social life and people are pretty nice. I've never heard of any cutthroat or intensely competitive interactions (I think pre-professional is a great word for the vibe). You just have to put in the work to put yourself out there and maintain relationships. I'm an Asian American originally from a mostly white suburban town. I think NEU is relatively diverse with respect to students and professors. Dining hall food is fine and there are a bunch of other places to eat around campus. NU is a city school so dorms aren't huge but the options after first year are nice. I'm a math/philosophy major and I've never felt bored in my classes. There's room for a life outside of academics (jobs and friends and such) but you definitely need to apply yourself. Most of my professors are as passionate about their field as they are knowledgable. No regrets here. I got a lot of financial aid, I really like living in Boston, I've met great people and I love what I'm studying. Best of luck to you. 

Also some other notes:
- ALWAYS consult RateMyProfessor
- Our co-op program is great
- The walk from one end of campus to the other is less than 20 minutes
- The mental health services are very helpful
- Our semesters don't line up with other schools', so winter break here is a week or two earlier than everywhere else"
schizoaffective,fkzbgjp,t3_flkj9r,1584667119.0,Sometimes I try to ground myself in the present by making lists of different types of cheeses or naming red things in the room. Then I tell myself that this moment was at one point a part of an unknown future and it turned out pretty ordinary. There's best case scenario and there's worst case scenario but the future is most likely going to be something in the middle. That comforts me a little bit
schizoaffective,fkyk2n0,t3_flbjiq,1584650299.0,"This really resonates with me. I find it helpful to reach out to a couple different people when things are bad, if for no other reason than because they all have something different to offer in terms of support and wisdom. I'm hoping it also divides up the sadness that I put out. I also try to do what I can to support the people that support me, even just by making cookies or tidying up or listening to them vent. Makes things feel not so one-sided. I don't know all the resources out there but I've done group therapy, outpatient programs and individual therapy twice a week in the past. There's lots of peer support online, too. Hope things get better for you soon"
schizoaffective,fku73mb,t3_fkklfq,1584543652.0,I like to listen to music in the dark or during a sunset while driving or something like that. Kinda feels like being in a movie or a different plane of existence.
