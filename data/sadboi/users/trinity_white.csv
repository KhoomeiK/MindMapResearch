limerence,fqff9n3,t3_gilg67,1589323851.0,"When you are young hormones are very potent and you feel that gut wrenching love and then gradually it changes to a deeper, slower more at peace feeling of acceptance and connection. Usually. But not necessarily. 

Also that doesn't mean a person can't fall madly in love at 85. With butterflies and everything. 

Hormone levels change trough years in particular for women who go trough many more changes than men (pregnancy, motherhood, pre- and menopause, monthly cycles...) . This is a direct link to how you perceive life and with that how you feel love. 

Check The Female brain by Brizendine. It was an eye opener for me and I understand better how hormones influence everything. 
Another good read is Sexual intelligence by Marty Klein. Also discusses how love has many faces and how to accept those changes of how love feels in different stages of partnership."
limerence,fqf6at4,t3_gic5dt,1589319433.0,"Look up ENFP, what you describe are few personality traits that are typical for this personality type. I know I have them, maybe not as strong as you describe but I understand what you are saying ... 

Strong emotions are nothing bad, they are like spice in the food, cherry on cake. Of course they bother you because you know they aren't based on anything but pure excitement you feel towards people, even those you don't know very well.

I think talking with a therapist or a group where you are able to challenge and prepare yourself for future encounters could do you a lot of good. Try to understand your feelings and try to make peace with them or learn to not jump to every impulse.

I'm pretty sure mindfulness would also be a good thing to try.

Don't be too hard on yourself. You are blessed for having these strong feelings. Wish you all the best."

But its not healthy. It consumes me and in the long run leaves me empty and depressed. I want to resist having bad thoughts about him because I do believe we can someday again be friends.

Start communicating things that you are afraid of transparently. Because you don't have a crystal ball to tell you what will happen and if you tell yourself enough times its going to happen, its a prophecy you unintentionally fulfill.

With expressing your fears its important you acknowledge them as fear so you distance from the actual outcome. You can fight fear, there are plenty strategies. I would suggest going to therapy."

I more or less stopped with compulsive actions (ex. stalking social to get that high) except I find solace in the daydreams and use it as an escape. This comes usually in the morning and at night but also when I feel low or lonely, which has been a lot lately.

Like I had to fight for my brothers attention when I was a kid I now feel the need to make my LO realise he cares for me and I'm special to him. I need to feel special to him to become worthy again, in my broken mind. 

I'm thinking this LE happened for a reason. I was quite insecure my whole life about myself, but with age and self acceptance came a bit of peace in mind so I was quite happy in my bubble. Until it burst. 

I have a good paying job I am very passionate about. 

I have kids that are well mannered and very smart, I love to hang out with them and teach them stuff yet I wasn't hanging out with them and was becoming very unhappy with my family life. 

My partner unknowingly to me (I knew he drank, but not to what extent and the reasons behind) became an alcoholic, especially in the last few years, and didn't do much around the house so I ended up working everything myself, hoping he would one day jump in. 

But every time he starts something to help around its like he intentionally sabotaged and in the end I ended up working even more with him helping me. 

Also he hated my job so I would stop talking to him about anything related to it and became very angry with me for whatever and lashed out on many occasions. I followed suit and everything just became toxic in a few years time. 

Then I met my LO. All hell brakes loose. 

I think he was kind of a godsend. He made me realise I still am able to fall in love and feel happiness. With him it was obviously not intended to be but I did begin a journey to find my happiness with renewed energy.

A year later me and my partner came a long way. He stopped drinking and became a lot more present day to day with doing chores in and around the house. 

I am trying very hard to build back the love and respect me and my SO lost in the dark times. My limerence, of which SO knows nothing about, still has a hold on me yet has subsided a lot. 

I managed to shed a lot of compulsive behaviours regarding my LO except for the daydreaming. I still use it sometimes to calm myself down or when I can't sleep at night. I think this is my coping mechanism that's been alive in me since I was a kid so I'm pretty sure it will eventually fade or be replaced by some other dream.

Me and my SO we have serious issues in our relationship as a result of being enamored at this early stages. I ignored a lot of red flags and still suffer as result. And we are both pretty healthy stable people, without any serious previous mental health issues.

The age difference by itself will become an issue sooner or later, sorry to have to say that but it most probably will.

 This latest episode was when I almost burst with not being able to give love to my SO because of a very long period of 2 years when we were not very intimate in sexual and any other way. In a way it was like having a roommate. 

Now that my SO and I reconnected I feel much more at peace and don't obsess over the LO that much but I'm also having issues with letting them go completely. We still talk from time to time. It doesn't elicit so many obsessive actions from me however I do tend to think about our conversations afterwards, which tells me I am on a thin line.

It helped me to have NC for 2 months so I was able to shed majority of the obsessive things (like checking social) and now with LC I think I am in a good place, still mildly anxious but also good feeling that I have a much better handle on things.

I think limerence comes out in different forms. But the gist of it is the obsessive nature of it.

Stop your daydreaming and force your thoughts on anything else, try to untangle sexy thinking away from him. Its really important you occupy yourself with activities. Physical and emotional (reconnect with friends). I started therapy once a week and it really does help, my therapist helps me see things a bit out of the usual loop and I am able to resolve little bits every time I go. And with time these little bits count a lot."

ENFP,fgl7ckm,t1_fgkk86n,1580884553.0,"What are some of the traits that you have?

For me is sudden anxiety attacks in some social situations. Daydreaming. Shame. Procrastination. Being late. Being exhausted by every day chores and trying to plan everything is something I can only do if I hyper focus and it consumes me. Mood swings, euphoria to depressed. Extreme problems with focus. Extreme emotional attachments (limerence) and compulsory behaviour patterns. Prone to addiction and substance abuse history. 

Some traits seem to became a lot worse when I hit 40. But probably a lot has to do with me accepting myself more and letting go of masks."

You need to heal your addiction before you can dream of becoming her friend. And even then... Not sure if its possible without opening wounds.

I have no better than to say NC and time will heal your problem. I try reading a lot, forcing myself not to think of LO, finding new things that excite me, exercise and hang out with friends. It really does help if you make yourself not think of her and establish new habits."

Its really hard to see everything in the right light. That's what bothers me the most. I really do think we would be a good match. Even if its induced by some addiction like chemical processes in the brain."

I fooled myself too many times and checked his social, even reconnected after 1m NC last week. It felt benign at that time but after one week NC I started feeling tormented again.

There are 3 main reasons why this LE was triggered. I am working on 2 of them. The third one will hopefully be addressed by my SO. I got this. Just need to keep on going forward."

I do have some history of anxiety, OCD like behaviour and have had hyper focus on things of interest. This traits of mine have actually made my life interesting and ful of excitement in the past, when I needed to resolve some hard issues I'm so focused on resolving them its like nothing else exists. I make things happen. Its like everything I set my mind to happens. That's the sort of person I am. On good day, I feel I'm invincible. 

However this time, when my LO was my hyper focus, it was like watching a train wreck and not having any way of stopping. I knew it can't be healthy, I was conflicted because of my SO and kids, but still didn't, couldn't stop myself. I just kept on dreaming it could happen. 

He was my safe heaven in one of the hardest years of my life. But it started to torment me and I did few very bad and impulsive choices as a result.

Thank you for your reply. Your answer calmed me down. Its just an addiction. Nothing more. Its not love, even if it feels like it."
limerence,fg7dnqf,t1_fg6kf6c,1580589980.0,"You are right. That pretty much sums up my current state. Addiction. When I met him I was at a very low point, now I'm better but can't seem to stop thinking of him, specially on a day when I feel down. 

Thank you. Helps a lot I can share this with someone."
limerence,ffxs3ud,t1_ffxgayt,1580331328.0,"I don't find it depressing but it does devalue the magic of love if you look at it from that perspective. 

My SO used to be my LO more than 15 years ago. It was magical for years but also painful, I was so under the spell I didn't set any boundaries and was happy basically with anything he threw at me. 

The relationship changed a lot in the years and it was good for a long time. The kids changed things, we lost each other while parenting and we both changed so much. 

We are both going to therapy now working things trough. He has addiction to alcohol I have addiction to my LO and I don't feel those butterflies anymore and I crave them and don't value what I have enough. 

I realised love is what gets us going but to me love is also what keeps me going, I need it or else I search for it elsewhere."
limerence,ffxcyby,t3_evq081,1580322597.0,"Had this feeling yes. Then after came the rabbit hole. It varies from time of day, day of month, moon to moon... depending on weather, people around me, tasks I have to do, everything and nothing. 
Then it depends of how I feel. Am I strong or stressed, hungry, did I exercise, did anyone say anything nice to me that day...do I feel pretty, do I feel smart... 

The point being, the state of limerence and the changes I can observe regarding it... its not really something that happens on the outside but outside world affects me and I am the source of my feelings, so limerence is subjected to all that is happening to me.

Today I read an article regarding serotonin transporter and feeling of love and ocd and how it all works in a similar fashion. Basically we are all just programmed to fall in love for the sake of evolution and the wiring in us limerants is just not perfectly tuned in."
limerence,ffx2kft,t3_evo17q,1580316391.0,"So much yes. It gets worse every time there is a bump in my relationship with my SO.

I was very strong and even feeling the end of my LE near then I started with the daydreaming again as a means of escape from reality when I learned my SO is lying to me.

I guess if my SO and I wouldn't have deep rooted issues the attachment to my LO wouldn't even happen to such an extent."
limerence,ffwesob,t3_evlftr,1580298276.0,"Congratulations for the milestone! 

Being or feeling lonely is a very hard thing. I think this same reason got me hooked to my LO. I have SO and kids, and a bunch of friends I see all the time and still I was just feeling lonely and unappreciated and unloved and fell into the trap of filling the void with my LO. 

Today is a very hard day for me. I'm feeling very sad and down and miss my LO. We were friends and helped each other until it was evident I can't do this anymore since my feelings got out of hands. 

Your post and seeing how much you overcome already and how strong you are gives me a little strength and bit of a push to not give up, to stop wallowing and just take this day and the next until I stop feeling this miserable. 

Thanks for sharing! Thanks for lifting me up."

aspergers,ff0nm8t,t1_fezpeia,1579470583.0,"I'm a mom. I can tell you how frustrating it is to need to tell people same things over and over, to wash dishes, throw garbage out, vacuum, clean the floors, clean the table, clean any home surface, put away clothes, anything really. I mean she knows what those tasks are because she needs to do them. And she needs to plan them out. You need to learn how to do that too in your own way. 

Try writing all tasks down and when you are free,  start reading the list and observing your surroundings to see which of the tasks needs to be done. And then do them. 

To me, its really stressful to need to have everything under control and  needing to point out every little detail that needs to be done to my 2 kids and partner.

Some shit went down with my SO that really put me off track and it pushed all those daydreams of my LO back in my head, sort of an escape so I don't need to think about what to do. 

After writing all the things I would want to say and reading it... I am even more sure I must not send it. He asked me not to contact him. He would not appreciate this letter in which I poured my heart in. I don't want to deepen my anguish or reopen fresh wounds ."

Sure you over shared I get why you are anxious it happens you are human, nobody said you have to have that mask everybody has on. You are genuine and truthful. Some people will understand and accept some will not. And its ok. 

What you need to do is accept yourself for the unique individual you are and don't beat yourself for being you. Simple as that. People will like you or hate you that's up to them. You can't go wrong with being authentic. The filters will be put in place when you feel more calm with yourself and not feel overwhelmed. Find some authentic people in your work to go for coffee and connect with them. Leave the ones who don't appreciate you or they mock you.

limerence,fdjrmxw,t1_fdhlqgt,1578484926.0,"I'm also in relationship. My LO is from another country so I don't get to see him a lot and I think this fact by itself helped cause the limerence. For me it stared with a infatuation. When I met him I was in a state of mind where I was desperate for some genuine emotional connection (my relationship with the SO was very strained) and we clicked amazingly so my mind started using the scarce memories of us together as an escape in daydreaming sessions. 

I contacted him after our meeting and we started chatting. 
I used the new found energy to build myself up again but then I also got hooked up on the dopamine our chat interactions elicited from my body. Also my relationship with the SO started to improve over time a bit but I wasn't completely emotionally available to my SO (because of the LO) which caused shitstorms in my head.

I consider LO a good friend but because I have mixed feelings of lust and genuine care for him there is no way I can stay in touch as friends. I tried over the course of a year but my limerant brain is just being overwhelmed to the point where I can't focus on my job and my life and not able to move on. 

I'm in NC for a month now, it was a decision he suggested after I disclosed. I know its the right path and was actually feeling relief when he suggested. But I am still struggling with everything and overwhelmed in my head. Hoping the nagging feeling will stop soon. I do see that I am more able to connect to my SO after this one month already, so I am optimistic."
limerence,fdgxckb,t3_elar7k,1578410644.0,"Always had tendencies to daydream as a means of escaping from a very lonely childhood. 

As a kid and throughout my primary school I was made fun of a lot by 3 girls from my school. I wasn't dressed well enough, didn't have the right sort of clothes and was very skinny. Also didn't have a big set of friends so they would pick on me and call me names because they could. 

I finally won everybody's approval after one of the cool kids (a boy) realized I was ok to hang out with and then those same girls started seeing me in a different light even asking me how to put make up on and trying hard to be my friends, complimenting me which felt really strange and fake.  

Looking back this could be the first manifestation of a pattern I am experiencing in my life from then on. Wherever I go and wherever I find myself in I tend to find somebody who fits this cool guy persona (later in life it was not about them being cool kids but people that would seemingly possess traits I find lacking or were things I missed in my life or would be people I find very interesting for whatever reason) and then fixate myself around them to get acceptance and acknowledgement. Achieving my goal would put me on an amazing high, body would reward me with the good chemicals and I would feel I am on top of the world. 

Its a strategy I used all my life to ""achieve"" things I thought I needed, usually completely subconsciously or to feel whole. 

I have no idea how to brake that wiring but I think it should help a lot to recognize patterns and address them head on while they are happening and not to let yourself fall in that pit again."
