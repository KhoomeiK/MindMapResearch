And 2/3 of these communicates with their clients (I didn't even get an invoice from LinkedIn). ""Don't get LinkedIn learning,"" is honestly how I feel."
Instagramreality,eov0lus,t1_eou7107,1558885875.0,"I totally agree that social media is partially to blame, but the whole body image thing has been an issue since before Instagram's 2010 launch. I.e. Kate Moss, ""Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels,"" and even prior to that (I'm a 90s child, that's the first thing that came to mind). Forgive me if I'm being nitpicky with the use of the word, ""wholeheartedly."""
