BPD,fpauufi,t3_gcafyy,1588456176.0,"Great post. I think that I have definitely fallen victim to hating myself for hurting others and, while it feels completely visceral and organic at the time, it always feels manipulative in retrospect. You may not intend it, but ultimately it compounds the wrongdoing by leveraging it for sympathy. You paralyze your partner because they become afraid to hold you accountable. 

I think that it’s easier to make that shift over time. Usually, I enter into an immediate mode of self loathing and frenzied guilt but, as time goes on, I look at things more clearly, understand my responsibility to improve moving forward, and work to better myself. Unfortunately, by that time I’ve almost always lost the person I’m clinging to and have driven myself into a further state of dismay.

The trick, of course, is being able to do this in the moment so that you aren’t manipulative to a partner and can preserve your sense of equilibrium. Not an easy task for any of us, but something that should be prioritized over most everything else."
BPD,fp31bvl,t3_gb0yxm,1588271403.0,"Same, and I don’t even really feel comfortable with sex. If I had my way, I’d probably never be physical with my partner ...at least for a long while.. but in every relationship I’ve ended up trying to initiate constantly and have actually been pushy to a point that my partner has been really upset. 

It’s taken me a long time to figure it out because it feels so contradictory, but I think that I always assumed (and was explicitly told) that sex was normal and that all people wanted it. I tended to apply this wholesale to everyone and started feeling like, to make anyone in any relationship happy, I’d have to be up for sex all the time. I also conflated sexual activity with a confirmation of love, and I sort of just assumed that since everyone in loving relationships had sex constantly, that sex was basically a way of saying I love you. And so even though I didn’t necessarily want it, it was expected within these relationships and was also a way I could confirm my partner still loved me. So my pushing for sex was both a way to constantly try to live up to what I thought my partner (and all partners) expected and also, in doing so, a way to constantly confirm that they still loved me, which is obviously significant in trying to silence abandonment anxiety."
smalldickproblems,foxrgx0,t1_for5py1,1588153708.0,"Yup. For me, it’s not even the sex. I just want the companionship and love. If I could somehow jump right over the sex and keep everything else, I would gladly do it. But any affection a woman gives you upfront is essentially “on loan” until you prove worthy of it long term by being a satisfying sexual partner. So, not only do I know that I’d lose her affection if I moved forward, all the affection she’s currently giving me feels undeserved. Like I’m somehow deceiving her. It makes me scared to proceed, but it also makes me feel guilty that she even enjoyed my company in the first place."
smalldickproblems,fotr1hw,t1_fotcrp1,1588063073.0,"I haven’t really gotten up the nerve to show many women, but - in my experience - pretty overwhelmingly yes. Usually I get out before they ever see."
smalldickproblems,foqwqh0,t1_foqw2fr,1588002175.0,"I have no interest in meeting with any of these women and won’t be doing so. I also never offer to send pictures (beyond general face pics like I’d post on a dating site), though some of them have sent me stuff unsolicited. 

I have no doubt that if this were one step in the lead up to a physical encounter, it would end in disappointment. But, for my purposes and theirs, the virtual stuff is the endpoint. So I can feel completely confident seeing things through to fruition without worrying about what’s looming at the end of the road. 

If they imagine me having a huge dick (as I’m sure they do), that’s awesome. I imagine all of them having bodies they likely don’t have, so it’s all good. Just trying to discuss the newfound awareness of what it must feel like to operate unfettered like this in more normal interactions with women."
smalldickproblems,foqfkmq,t1_foqcdlj,1587992378.0,"100% agreed. 

There’s also the mindfuck involved of the woman feeling like you “deceived” her by getting her interested when clearly you should have known that you were inadequate. Which, of course, completely calls into question the value of not only all your other qualities but also the good times you shared with that person. You are forced to confront that your personality and connection were basically an (misleading) advertisement for your dick rather than substantive in their own right. 

And if those things are all you have to hold onto, that negation is devastating. Especially when it comes from someone you cared for."
smalldickproblems,foqd0b4,t1_foqc876,1587990500.0,"They definitely exist, but they’re also considered to be bad. Certainly people are mocked for those bodily features, but society has broadly defined that mocking as tasteless and generally unacceptable. Which is why you might see it on a comedy special or in a movie or among friends, but never see it receive social sanction by appearing on a mainstream news show or in an office building or in a newspaper. At least not without a significant backlash afterward. I’ve seen/heard jokes about small penises in all three venues within the last few months, with no negative repercussions to speak of. 

There are also counterpoints to all of that criticism. Yes, some people get made fun of for having small breasts, but there are also entire web sites devoted to the beauty of small breasts. There are even web sites devoted to the beauty of the elderly or the fat. There are no websites devoted to the beauty of small penises; that bodily attribute factors into the landscape of sexuality only as a feature of shaming or humiliation, be it implicitly or fetishistically.

I’ve definitely sought therapy to help with this and, for the most part, cope in my every day life fairly well. I have to accept reality and basically put a box around not only sex but all those things to which sex might lead. If I can train myself to not think about sex or love or family or marriage or children, I find that I can be “happy” in my very narrow world of hobbies or interests. 

Every so often, though, one takes a step back and see the narrowness of the life they’ve been forced to accept and the great, sprawling broadness of life outside of these limitations. Those moments are hard. Like you said, though, it’s all about learning to control the degree to which they derail you."
smalldickproblems,foq6lp3,t1_foq5btx,1587984852.0,"Ha ha ha. Probably true! But his point stands, for sure."
smalldickproblems,foq64rk,t1_foq5pfj,1587984381.0,"Agreed. But I also think that small dicks are unique in two regards: 

1) they are one of the things that society has almost agreed upon as a consensus negative. No one has a preference for small dicks, and small dicks are used as a byword for male inadequacy on all fronts. Go on pornhub. There are categories validating all body types: fat, busty, small chested, big assed, muscular, tall, short, you name it. The only thing you find relating to small dicks are fetishes rooted in humiliation. No one sees it as desirable or beautiful. It’s not just the majority opinion, it’s the near universal truth.

2) unlike with other things, society has also tacitly agreed that open shaming of small dicks is acceptable and fun. A month ago I watched an episode of a liberal morning news show in which a panel of contributors of all ages and genders sat around cackling at a small penis joke made by one of the moderators. Not a single panelist spoke up to suggest it wasn’t something to laugh about or even tried to hide their amusement. This is the same group of people who advocate for representation and rights for people of all different body types. This would never be tolerated when discussing weight or height or, god forbid, breast size. It’s one of the last points (along with male baldness) of physical judgment that is seen as appropriate. And, if you’re one of the poor suckers whose life is being ruined by the problem they’re mocking, better suck it up and laugh along, lest you confirm every stereotype about sensitivity and weakness that we attach to the poor men of whose dick size we don’t approve."
smalldickproblems,foq5q8e,t1_foq54ol,1587983968.0,"Totally. It is a prerequisite. 

And, also, the pressure of revelation intensifies in direct proportion to the existing emotional attachment. I don’t really love the idea of showing anyone my penis, but if given the choice between revealing myself to a stranger or to someone whose love, respect, and companionship I already value and rely upon, I’ll take the former in a second. 

I’ve been in situations where I’ve had the love first. And it’s only worse because you know what you’re going to lose before you lose it. The idea of companionship and affection isn’t an abstract hope that may never develop, it’s a living reality that is about to erode in front of your eyes. 

And if people think it sucks to be rejected on the basis of your dick by someone who doesn’t love you or have any reason to care about you beyond your appearance, try being rejected by someone who claimed to love you and care for you already. 

Try being rejected by someone who was willing to overlook personality or professional or emotional flaws, but can’t overlook what’s in your pants. THAT really underscores how much it actually means and how much more important it is than anyone will admit or that you want to believe. 

I’m in my thirties, and sometimes I daydream about being elderly. Sixty or seventy. Why? Because i have this idea that maybe at that age, sex really would be unimportant. That maybe if I hold out long enough, I could have a relationship of love and emotional intimacy and true trust that wouldn’t be inevitably torpedoed by my dick. Of course, gone are holes of children, or family, or those rare moments of youthful excitement. Buying a home, vacations as a couple. But at least love, finally."

What fun it is that every woman who meets me assumes I have a huge dick and that most of the women who’ve wanted to be with me have been attracted to me for this very reason."
smalldickproblems,foq3xcv,t1_foq3cs8,1587982097.0,"Thanks dude, and I agree one hundred percent. 

People who suggest its a trivial concern are speaking from a place of privilege because they don’t understand, and have never had to consider, the way that sexuality facilitates (or impedes) all the true joys of life. It’s like people who will lecture you about money not being everything. These are always people who’ve never been truly poor, because if they had been poor they would’ve realized that money is not only money. It’s the ability to be healthy, to support your children, to take care of a pet you love, to help your parents, to sustain a marriage. It’s not what really counts, but not having it is a guarantee that you’ll never get the things that really do. 

Sex is the same way. To be honest, sex means little to me. It may just be because my own insecurities have forced me to downplay its role in my life forever, but nevertheless. What I care about is family, children, a wife, love, trust, security. And if I could get any of those things without sex, I’d be thrilled. Unfortunately, sex is a necessary avenue through which you bring those things into being. It’s easy to act like sex isn’t a big deal because, for most, it’s one casual step down the path to the true joys of life. For us, it’s a big, insurmountable wall that seals us off from those joys altogether. So, yes, it’s a big fucking deal. 

And, like you, I’ve had real life examples of this too. I’ve had girlfriends I’ve loved more than words can describe. Who wanted to be with me and who believed in me. Who I pushed away because of sex or who left me once they realized the truth about me physically. I’ve had other women who’ve been very interested, all of whom I ran from or rejected, not because I wasn’t interested but because I anticipated the inevitable. In each of those people, I felt the possibilities and hints of joy that, for many, can be openly pursued and made real. And I either lost it or gave it up, because - at best - for me, those joys are a tease or an illusion, 

This, I guess, is just the first time I was able to experience NOT stopping. Of following through with confidence and self assurance. Of not being afraid. And I realized how incredibly liberating it must be. And how every aspect of life must be different for those who can play by these rules in life rather than only in fantasy."
smalldickproblems,foq2yzp,t1_foq2i3l,1587981099.0,"Well, I think some are transferable. I think that obviously there are elements of psychology and emotional engagement utilized in sexting that could conceivably be used in reality. And, of course, if you have the creativity necessary to be novel in sexting, you could theoretically deploy those same ideas in reality. 

The problem is that the fantasy world of sexting colors in the physical aspects of sex in a way that draws not on the harsh bodily realities, but the imagination of the participants. All I’m responsible for is rendering circumstance and situation and movement; her mind will fill in how I look and how everything feels. 

And therein lies the problem. What she imagines is something I could never provide in reality. I have no doubt that I could be just as creative and emotionally engaging and erotic and romantic with women in real life, but those are inevitably all pieces of prelude that lead to the physical resolution. And my body - my dick - is the embodiment of an anticlimax. 

Both in fantasy and life, I have no doubt of my ability to execute a pretty effective build up. But only in the world of fiction can I follow through in a way that makes her feel satisfied rather than just making me feel ashamed."
smalldickproblems,foq2cuz,t1_foq2398,1587980449.0,"So deeply. Like, to the core. 

Of course, in almost every one of these sexting conversations, the woman will inevitably say something like “I want your big dick” or “show me your huge cock.” I usually just don’t acknowledge this and redirect to something else because I don’t want to mislead but also don’t want to dwell.

I thought this would hurt, but it doesn’t. As long as she seems satisfied and happy with me, it doesn’t even matter if her words reaffirm the fundamental source of my pain.

So on top of all this, how sad is it that I’ve also realized that my pain isn’t even about me? Being reminded, yet again, that when left to articulate fantasy, women will always emphasize size, size, size doesn’t even hurt. As long as they’re happy, I’m happy. 

It’s not even that I want to feel good enough. All I’ve ever wanted was to be able to make another person happy. And I can only do that in make believe, not real life. What a joke of an existence."
BPD,foatfes,t3_g6ft9k,1587652219.0,"I tried to kill myself and got myself out of inpatient by lying. I lied to get my phone saying I needed to contact my boss and then lied to a friend so that they would corroborate my lie when contacted.

BPD,fo62ndq,t3_g5u503,1587544217.0,"It’s the only thing I want too. 

Literally the only thing that motivates me or makes me happy. I don’t care about money or a career or personal achievements or anything like that. I got a great job, who can I tell? No one. Oh, I won an award! Let me go home and share the great news with...my wall. Fuck it. I just want a place where I can feel at home and stable and cared for. 

I think it makes sense. All the other stuff feels like things you worry about when your core psychological needs are being met. If you still don’t have a basic foundation and sense of safety, everything else seems pointless. So of course I fixate in finally putting that foundation in place. 

Of course, since the only way anyone would want to marry me is if i built myself into a desirable product by pursuing things I have no interest in obtaining, I’ll never actually get the only thing I want. And, let’s be honest, even if I ever did find a wife and have a family, I’d just worry non stop about losing them and, through my own bullshit, inevitably would."
BPD,fnq9bfv,t3_g37inw,1587160174.0,"This is one of my biggest issues. I can only think in black and whites, especially as things happen. Much of my more nuanced thinking has to be done in advance. So, for instance, if I’m hanging out with a friend, I can be more reasonable and realistic beforehand and will often try to think through what might happen. This will lead to a rough “script” for how things will go.

If things don’t follow this script, I generally start to feel intense panic, as though I’m in a crisis. I don’t really know what to do and how to act, and I think I start to feel like I’m close to being abandoned. Because I think I’m failing and can’t think on my feet in the moment, I often just hammer away trying to “fix it,” which leads to me being really pushy or demanding. I think I’m trying to get things back on track, but I’m really just failing to go with the flow and adapt to changes. 

I’m trying to be less absolute and have incorporated some exercises that center me in the moment and hopefully allow me to ask questions of myself that give me a better sense of what’s happening and how I can feast. But when things change it is still hard for me to understand - in the moment - that it’s just a normal shift in someone else’s mood or desires rather than a breakdown of what’s “supposed” to happen because I’m somehow failing."

It’s been three years and I’ve not gone on a single date, had a single kiss, etc. I feel lonely, but only for the people I lost. If I could have them back, I would in a second. But the idea of someone new doesn’t even appeal to me anymore."

I think you need to break up with him if you know that you want to. It’s not fair to him to be hanging on to what may feel like a very tumultuous and anxiety provoking relationship with hopes of fixing it when you know that it’s unfixable. I understand that it’s a hard time to deal with it, but it’s also a great excuse to be separate from him and force him to accept your decision. 

Tell your friends that you’d appreciate if they could check in on you and try to reach out to them. If you have a therapist, try to make some phone appointments.

I’m talking about times that I’ve had multiple nights worth of deep, five hour conversations with someone. When they’ve obviously put a lot of time into getting to know me and when we’ve shared some degree of connection. That’s how this one was.

It’s obviously WAY worse to do it in a real life relationship or friendship (I’ve done both), but I still think it’s kind of crappy to not at least give a heads up to someone if you’ve developed a level of intense convo. I think that’s especially true now because having not met someone is almost a non existent qualifier. I may well be that, if you could actually see human beings, they might not have had conversations of this intensity before meeting.

Only when I met my next significant other did that stop. Of course I fucked it up and she left too. So the same cycle has repeated. It’ll be three years in June, and every day she’s all I think about. I still feel that space where she should be as fully as I did when she left.

So much of my improvement has involved controlling the circumstances of my life to minimize triggers, but relationships are a completely different challenge. Even though I think I’ve learned how to control my reactions to circumstances previously encountered in prior relationships, all new relationships bring new and complex challenges. In order to work through those, we pretty much have to be at our best in terms of control, self awareness and honesty, have a partner whose awareness of and openness with their own issues are equally evolved. That’s not easy to find and doesn’t even take into account all the financial, circumstantial, intangible factors that always need to fall into place to make relationships work.

When an alcoholic gets clean, they’re still not advised to hang out at bars. The triggers are always there and are best avoided. 

I kind of think I’ll have to always be alone if I want to avoid completely falling apart, which sucks.

LSAT,fij55hh,t1_fij4es2,1582434925.0,"It’s just such an unnecessary barrier to assessment. As a teacher, if I were deciding an assessment and incorporated a device or skill set completely unrelated to the skill assessed, I would be told that assessment was grievously flawed. That’s exactly the case with the tablet. It introduces a necessary skill set and competency that has no relevance to the assessed skill. Further, it places unnatural limitations on valid means of approaching the subject matter, forcing test takers to work through an arbitrary number of note taking options rather than allowing them to use strategies most natural to them. 

It also very clearly disadvantages both older test takers for whom technology is unfamiliar AND poorer test takers who haven’t had access to technology and cannot afford classes or a tablet for practice. Ideally, a test should minimize these inequalities; this one emphasizes them."

BPD,fi45h4i,t1_fi44sok,1582134363.0,"I think one of the issues is that for me “bring done talking” is inherently a bad thing. When I’m around someone I like, I want to talk to them all the time and so it almost feels like someone’s disinterest in conversing is indicative of my own failing or their dislike of me. 

This has been a problem in relationships because, basically, I won’t shut up. I’ve had girlfriends who want to just sit around in silence on their phone or read books and not communicate. For a long time, I wasn’t able to even understand why they’d want to be around me if they were going and felt I must be boring them. I’d try to be more aggressively entertaining when really they just wanted to be left alone. It was so hurtful and felt like being abandoned while someone was with you, even though I logically understand it now. 

I’ve happened to see a few relationships up close recently and they involve a lot of people sitting around not talking to each other. I don’t understand it, but it was explained to me that simply the other persons presence is enough for a lot of people. I’ve been trying to internalize that and would hopefully be better at handling it in the future. 

The text thing is kind of a digital form of the same issue. I’ve learned not to chase the person for more conversation, so I’m doing what I should do reaction wise. It hasn’t stopped hurting, though."
BPD,fi0vjpg,t1_fi0v7b5,1582045643.0,"To me at least, while it’s not as problematic as other behaviors, it kind of ... feels.. the same.

The triggering emotions are different (fear with abuse or guilt with self harming or excitement with over sharing) but they share that same sense of losing control and acting without immediate recognition of aims or outcome AND the prevailing absence of insight into the feelings or needs of others."

I suspect I feel guilty that the person seems to like me and have some unconscious need to make sure they know how horrible I am, but who knows. 

The only way I can address it is by limiting my interactions and discussions to the point that I seem standoffish and cold. But I can not be talkative and social without over sharing in the way you describe. Or at least I haven’t figured out how yet."

I would say more accurately that the only people who see any non-quiet symptoms are FP and family members. My BPD does manifest with other people, but it almost functions in a preventative way. I usually get really invested in new people and idealize them, then split decisively on them shortly after for something insignificant and basically avoid them permanently. This prevents me from ever feeling so trapped in a relationship that the true open BPD ugliness comes out. With FP or family members, I am already invested and therefore feel trapped. That leads to the more pronounced flarings of emotion and, if I’m not careful, worse behavior."
smalldickproblems,fgf72jg,t3_eup420,1580727966.0,"When people say they want men to be sensitive and open, what they really mean is that they 

A) want men to be “sensitive” to other people’s problems. Read: all the problems burdening the women who view constant emotional support as a relationship prerequisite 

B) want men to be open so that problems are obvious and can therefore mark certain men as undesirables. Women hate nothing more than falling for a man only to find he’s emotionally weak. They want openness so they can detect these men and avoid them. 

In short, people want men to be sensitive enough to deal with the emotional problems of others and either emotionally tough or emotionally open with weakness that they can be easily written off as partners. 

Don’t ever believe women will truly stick with you or try to hold you up if you burden them with persistent depression, anxiety, or insecurity. The best ones will try for a while, but even they will eventually leave you because you’re not “confident” enough or something similar."

BPD,fg0636a,t1_fg04kho,1580401027.0,"Six months isn’t that long when you’re undertaking a process like this. You have to be patient with yourself. 

You probably did hurt her, but while it was your fault, it wasn’t your intention. You have to keep affirming to yourself that if you can somehow align your behavior with your intention you can eventually be different than the person who hurt her. It won’t bring her back, but over time you can start to escape the person you were then. Because that person was toxic to everyone, including you. 

As someone who’s been where you are for years, it does get easier. Easier isn’t the right word, actually. You become more numb. What is now a catastrophe of the present becomes a shame of history. It still rises up to terrorize you, but it becomes easier to draw that mental line between what you’ve done and what you are. In the same vein, it does become easier to imagine yourself having a relationship. If only because you start to see yourself as different than you were, which makes you feel at least semi capable or at least theoretically open. 

I haven’t had a single date since the relationship I described. I loved my girlfriend with all my heart and, in many cases, did everything I could to sacrifice for her and support her. It still amazes me that such good intentions, genuine feelings, and frequent great behavior could come in the same package as abusiveness. As someone who’s always been drawn to people who struggle the way I do, I have this feeling that I should be there to build her up - even though I was the one who hurt her. The sense of responsibility and duty makes it harder to love her less, as perverse as that sounds. The difference is that now I know it’s not healthy; even though I still feel that way, I recognize it and move on rather than acting on it. These are all things I could not have done when I was with her. Sometimes I’ll catch myself noticing a positive change and take a small measure of pride in feeling like I’m becoming slightly less the person who hurt her and maybe slightly more the person I tried and she wanted me to be.

I think the more you start to recognize yourself as different, the more the relationship begins to feel compartmentalized. It’s still present and traumatic and haunting, but it’s something that happened rather than something that is. As that process continues, your love for the other person changes. It’s not that you love them less, you just love them the way you’d love someone who’s died. You accept that your feelings will never have an outlet and, in knowing that you’re doing everything you can to address the reason for that, you learn to live with it. I feel like I’m still not at the place where I would entertain being in a relationship, but I’m closer than I was after six months. I don’t expect to ever have another because I’d never go looking for one and don’t expect to fall into an opportunity, but I think I might be in a place where I’d hypothetically consider it after another year or so. 

You’ll get there. But it seems like you know that’s not the goal right now. The goal is fixing you and you’re taking the steps you can take. Fixing yourself will solve all the other problems in time. Just try to avoid pushing things forward before you’re ready."
BPD,ffzzkvj,t3_evo9y4,1580396851.0,"I also completely identify with this. It takes an incredible amount of strength to face the reality that you did horrible things, especially knowing that you did them to people you genuinely loved. Dealing with heartbreak is hard enough, but dealing with heartbreak when you know you deserved it is a complete mindfuck. 

I also abused my ex (not in the same way necessarily) and didn’t even entirely realize it until months after the fact. It started to truly sink in about six months after we broke up. Like, I was dealing with normal heartbreak and resentment and one day it just hit me that I had been abusive and that i deserved to be left. From that moment forward, it was so impossible to think of her without feeling completely nauseous. I suddenly thought of everything from her perspective and saw myself as a monster. I still had the same desire I always had for her to be happy and strong and secure, but I finally realized that it was me who had been standing in her way. It was so crushing. 

I’ve been dealing with it for two and half years and still struggle with it every day. It’s still the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think of at night. And, as crazy as it is, I still miss her, even though I know that I didn’t ever deserve to have her. 

But I have worked hard in the two years since, going to therapy twice a week every week, tackling things I always refused to talk about, and doing and sticking with DBT. I know I’m a better person now than I was then, but I also know that I can never stop being vigilant. I had gone to therapy before and had never been diagnosed, but I always just thought I was fixed. Or I apologized and thought I learned from my mistakes. But I realize now that there are a million new ways to make the same mistakes and even if I could avoid the exact same situations, I’d inevitably fall victim to new ones if I were not continually committed to therapy and self help. 

It’s a weird life now. I kind of view myself as someone living with an unpayable debt. I can never ever get back to where I was before, where I thought (wrongly) that I was completely good and valuable. I realize now that I thought that for the very reasons that I was able to behave the way I did. Instead, I view myself who will always carry the stain of being an abuser and who’s only recourse is to do good for others when possible and keep working to control my behavior so that I never hurt anyone else. Even if I do the best I can from this point forward, I know I’ll never feel “whole” like I did before. And yet, I also know I was never “whole” in the first place, I just hadn’t been brave enough to confront all my missing pieces. 

Like yourself, I decided long ago that I would never contact my ex. It would be selfish and it would hurt her. She initially wanted to remain friends after the breakup and, after ignoring two of her messages, I blocked her. Though it was a choice made for a selfish reason at the time, the long term impact is consistent with what I think is best. The one luxury I will allow myself is the belief that the only way I can ever address this issue directly is by making sure to never ever replicate it with anyone else. If I didn’t love her enough to treat her right, I hope I at least love her enough to respect her pain and use it as a lesson. 

I’ve been a piece of shit and I’ve hurt the person I loved most in the world. Not only does that same person probably hate me, but she has every right to do so. And yet I still have an opportunity and an obligation to improve. Sometimes it feels like there’s nothing  left of me to fix, but the progress I see disproves that feeling. I have been a monster and I have the capacity to be a monster again; but I also have the capacity to control myself. That’s all I can take away from it. It’s an imperfect, unsatisfying, hollow feeling process, but I keep wishing I had undertaken it before I met her. That alone tells me that at least now I’m on the right track."

BPD,ff2flms,t3_er5igb,1579504063.0,"I think this is why/how most people use dating apps at this point. They’re a validation machine.

M

I go through the same cycle. I’m a dude and I don’t get tons of matches, so the dopamine rush isn’t that great. But even the prospect of hearing from or being noticed by one person after weeks or months of feeling horribly lonely inevitably lures me back.

Of course, once you do hear from people, you just realize they can’t compare to the person you really want or are missing, so you get frustrated and quit, resolving to just accept the loneliness. That lasts for a while, then you repeat."
aspergers,few6ua2,t1_fevvvut,1579406135.0,"I don’t think this is necessarily true. In fact, it may just as easily be code for “I very much want you hanging around to validate me or give me attention until I find someone better.” There are plenty of reasons it’s said, but odds are that whatever they do have in mind is not going to be compatible with what you want when you still feel overwhelming affection for that person. Especially if you have a hard time letting go and form the sorts of connections you discuss. 

What usually happens is that the “friends” period lasts a while, with you feeling miserable and the other party getting the benefits of your attention without giving back what you want, and then it either fades out as they find something they want to invest in or ends abruptly when you just decide you can’t take it anymore. Either way, in effect, it will almost always end in you not being in each other’s lives in any major way. 

I’ve tried many times to preserve friendships out of a sense of duty, attachment, false hope, etc. Eventually I learned that it is in your best interest to politely decline any offer of friendship and cut someone out of your life completely when they break up with you. You are no more obligated to be someone’s friend than they are to love you and, if your feelings are drastically out of balance with theirs, the relationship will always make you feel hurt, insignificant, and jealous. As hard as it is, it’s in your best interest to end it conclusively immediately and work on figuring out how to be happy in some other way."

I can’t imagine it messing with the Lr too much and, frankly, I’m probably going to do poorly on LG no matter what. 

I do agree that the timer is a big help. It’s good to have that sense of traction within the timing of the test. Ditto with the answers. Obviously a huge step up from the scantron. 

It’s kind of just a selfish thing, really, in that I’m very comfortable reading with books/writing utensils and desperately uncomfortable with tablets, e readers, etc. I’m counting on RC to make up for my weakness in LG, so feeling less sure of myself in that area is making the pressure of improving on LG all the more overwhelming."

I read through the whole Kaplan section on LG and am still awful, so I purchased the LG Bible and am hoping that will probe more helpful. I’m generally very good at language based stuff and pretty terrible at more abstract/mathematical/visual problems.

I think, for me, the RC section is the big issue. I have been reading for hours every day for almost twenty years and have an intuitive sense of how to mark and notate quickly and efficiently at this point. I underline things but also circle and make margin comments where applicable and have gotten really decent and doing it predictively so that I don’t have to revisit much. The fact that I read quickly and have the ability to make notes effectively has allowed me to be -2 or -3 at worst on almost every RC practice test I’ve done. I’m really terrible at LG and was counting on RC to be my ace in the hole, so I’m super worried about having my very effective strategy disrupted.

I don’t know that this necessarily calls into question whether or not you can have bpd. Missing people and being confused over stuff like this isn’t just a bpd problem."
BPD,fecg7k6,t1_fecfo5g,1578973151.0,"Do you want to be with your ex romantically? If you feel like you would take him back if you could or if you feel like your feelings for him are impeding the development of your new relationship, I’d ask yourself whether you’re ready to be in this new relationship. It may be that you’re truly not over your ex, or it might be that the new one isn’t working for some reason and that’s causing you to idealize what you had. 

There’s a difference between missing someone who’s gone but being happy with the new person and missing someone to the point that you feel like you’re not invested in your current relationship. That’s something to think critically about and, if you feel it necessary, have a convo with your new boyfriend about it."
BPD,fecfjp9,t1_feceydm,1578972706.0,"Yes. I do all the time. 

I have learned that it ultimately makes me really unhappy to be friends with exes and now cut off contact entirely, but I miss all of them."
BPD,fecenkt,t3_eof632,1578972107.0,"I think it’s probably normal for everyone to some degree. 

If you only have significant others to fill a functional role in your life, then I suppose you’d never miss an old one once a new one was in place.

But if you were with someone because you cared and valued and enjoyed them for the unique person they were, there are going to be things about them you miss even when someone else is in their old spot. You can have a great new boyfriend you love and cherish, but that doesn’t mean that you don’t miss your old boyfriend for the person he was. 

I think it’s the degree to which you think/obsess over it that’s the real issue. Occasional pangs of missing someone who was special to you are likely common for everyone."
xmen,fe66up5,t3_enr42n,1578883108.0,"This was a great set. Psylocke was loooonnng overdue by that point, and the gambit and juggernauts were huge upgrades. The night crawler face was a bit rough, but at least it didn’t have suction cups affixed to its body. 

The wolverine was a bummer, but we got water wars Wolverine a year or so later. That was the definitive wolverine for the next ten years, so all was good."
smalldickproblems,fe60hn8,t1_fe60at1,1578879043.0,"I should say that it does dwindle after I’ve been on a while. What I describe lasts for a few weeks, but if I stay on my numbers definitely drop dramatically. I tend to hide my profile for a few weeks every so often (be it for that reason or just because it’s too depressing) and when I go visible again, the matches jump back up.

I think that somehow going invisible and reappearing every few weeks somehow helps you get more matches? I won’t claim to understand the algorithm, but maybe they place new people at the top of the deck or something."
BPD,fdsps25,t3_emxk17,1578706367.0,"Ask yourself how this situation would play out in reverse. 

If your girlfriend asked you to go to a strip club for her bachelorette party and your boyfriend FORBID it, he’d likely be considered controlling and insecure. Him not liking it is one thing, him telling you that you can’t do it would be seen as controlling behavior. 

It’s no different because it’s you. It’s something you don’t like. That’s your right. You expressed that you’re uncomfortable and he’s explained that he views it as an obligation. You can either accept that and deal with it or break up with him because you simply can’t tolerate it. But you can’t force him or try to force him to not do this just because you don’t like it."
LSAT,fdsc5vk,t1_fdqm1gz,1578699239.0,"Nice! Thank you. I will get it ASAP. 

I have a barons logic games workbook. Do you think that’s even worth starting?"
LSAT,fdsc332,t1_fdqj22j,1578699187.0,"Thanks for the advice. I would obviously be delighted if I could somehow hit 170, but even mid 160’s would make me really happy."
LSAT,fdqbv24,t1_fdq9bpx,1578662409.0,"Thanks. I suppose I have to get that LG bible. 

The Kaplan method for logic games seems helpful to me because I have virtually no intuitive sense of how to approach those problems, but I very much believe there is probably a better way. It is kind of convoluted and - in many cases - actually makes the problem feel more overwhelming rather than simplifying it.

I took a few suggestions from their LR and RC sections, but mostly just kind of went into it my own way. Creating visual maps of everything in a RC question would definitely be counterproductive for me, for instance. A few underlines are more than enough. 

I’m drilling myself hard because I want to apply soon. As I said, given my age, I don’t really have time to study for years. I either have to make something happen quickly or give it up. I have a strong undergrad GPA, so if I can improve my LG section enough to jump, say, 7 points, I’d be in a good spot."
xmen,fdlr76i,t3_ely8ym,1578530556.0,They always pick weird covers for these epic collections. The spider man ones in particular choose really weird cover art for the tpb cover.
smalldickproblems,fdlosco,t1_fdjlugb,1578528913.0,"Right. This is a forum designed to discuss a shared insecurity. Obviously, when you come into a sub about a particular issue and attempt to compare it to your own issues, it’s going to come across as minimizing the shared topic of conversation. If I were to go into any sort of woman’s issue forum and say “i totally understand because I have a small penis,” they would be rightly offended and resistant because it’d seem like I was speaking out of turn and trying to equate their issues with my own.

I don’t know that anyone here has tried to tell you how your vagina works. No one is arguing that some women might have vaginas that result in sex with a smaller penis being more pleasurable. What they’re saying (or at least what I’m saying) is that this is, quite frankly, beside the point. It’s about the social representation of small penises and all that it entails to have one, not about the individual preferences of individual women. That might matter to you, but it’s pretty secondary to the people who have to live with the stigmatized bodily feature their whole lives. You are viewing your preferences or the preferences of individual women as more significant than a towering social stigma that exists in the lives of men at every age and in perpetuity. In doing so you are, at best, distorting the lens through which impacted men experience this issue and, at worst, making a matter of lifelong social trauma into a superficial discussion of individual women’s sexual convenience.

If I have a 20 year old car that runs great and fits my needs, it might well be true that I’d prefer that car to a newer luxury model. But that does not negate the commonplace perception that my car is less desirable than a newer, fancier car. And if I had a kid, for instance, I should realize that there might be an element shame of as a result of being seen in such a car given that commonplace perception, despite that cars practical usefulness. I can encourage my child to focus on the latter, but to pretend the former doesn’t exist or is somehow irrelevant is insulting. 

And yes, I’m sure women hear all sorts of comments like that. That’s the reason I used the example. Because individual people do say stuff like that but, as a whole, society has decided that it is inappropriate to make those comments. Hence, no considerate women (as the commentator seemed to be) would perpetuate those ideas by making such comments to another woman. After all, such suggestions would no longer be accepted on tv shows or in media articles or in any workplace or even most social environments. If they occur in real life, they are frowned upon and rightfully taken as evidence that the issuer doesn’t get it. 

That is a far cry from making fun of and transferring blame for insecurities relating to penis size. Even in the age of “body positivity” and anti body shaming and diversified representation in swimsuit catalogs and underwear ads, OUR insecurities are still the stuff of tv humor and acceptable social conversation. Four years ago the city of New York released an official press release mocking a Donald Trump statue’s small penis. That release was carried with nary a condemnation by every major newspaper in the country and treated as acceptable humor across television news networks of all political affiliations. I have been in the room when professional colleagues have made jokes about penis size in work meetings and watched as everyone in the room laughed. Do you think the same would be possible with jokes about weight or vaginal depth or breast size? Not a chance. The stigma related to having a small penis is not comparable with other forms of body shaming or any other insecurity. 

It is not to say that others don’t suffer from insecurities or have not been criticized in other ways. They have been. But they can also look around them at the world at large and be affirmed in their belief that said shaming is wrong and hurtful. For us, any shaming we receive in person is echoed, endorsed, and validated by the world at large, which has the impact of making us feel unreasonable or guilty over our own pain. Comments that attempt to negate the legitimacy of that pain by offering up token stories of optimism or isolated counterpoints to widespread opinions only serve to intensify THAT very particular dynamic."
