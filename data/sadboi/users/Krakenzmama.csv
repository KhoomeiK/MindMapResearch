I'm a people pleaser at heart and want to keep them as a customer but if they get too far behind their accounts get closed or cannot get credit for new lines of service or perform certain actions in the account until they fix the problem. But if they want to solve the problem they have to uphold their end of the bargain! This is a business.

 One time I was talking to an abusive 911 dispatcher who told me my customer service skills were lacking - unfortunately for him arguments are not one of the services we offer- so I told him thank you for his feedback and it meant a lot coming from him, wished him well and sent him on his way. It stuck with me because some of our callers are likely suffering from PTSD due to their line of work.

Embracing my own shape has opened me up for other fashion choices and when I am being sexual I'm totally making sure that my boobs are getting love. After all, I've discovered they are a hotline to MY sex drive. The men in my life KNOW this and have used it to help me get to the mountain top. I'm good in bed and they didn't need big breasts to get them their kicks.

 There's  so many ways to embrace my femininity - dresses,skirts, makeup, energy, flirting etc. My little bitty titties are fine. Would I like big juicy boobs? yes! but I'm not sure if they would make me more feminine. It'd just make me eye candy and my femininity is not dependant on being something fun to look at. I love being female and although it has had its trials, I think being a woman is quite fine.

  This day and age has been so wonderful for exposing me to seeing gender expression in its wonderful ways. I've been lucky to see drag shows, meeting trans/gender fluid people, knowing people who have different forms of sexual - or non sexual- expression and it's amazing how we can not only look different but feel different too as humans.

I didn't mind how it was cast. but the writers skipped over chapters of the book, practically made Oprah the star of the thing and totally made everything up from whole cloth after Meg and Cal escaped Kamazotz.

For the work you will put into being pregnant a minimum of 5 times - heaven forbid things don't work out but mother nature can be cruel - you are giving way more than you are getting from him. Yes there will be babies but it is fricking hard to be pregnant and deliver even if you are healthy. You will have health effects from it for years to come in your body soul and mind. Motherhood in all its forms takes a toll.

 Sperm donors are easier to find for it's part and you can control how often.

FemdomCommunity,fimit3g,t3_f8h117,1582532137.0,"I am with a kinkster who has harbored forced same sex fantasies. We haven't done anything with a third but I have made my partner do things with my toys for my amusement - which he had admitted to doing on his own before anyhow. 

The way he put it to me was not that he thought it made him less heterosexual (although he seemed to preface it with I'm not gay or no but, I guess he said it to reassure me) or turn him into a female but that he was so into my power that he was willing to do what I wanted even if it meant me forcing him to perform fellatio. My subs want to be treated like toys - whether that doll is in the corner observing the scene or being picked up and played with. After we're done we become people again who need to remember who they truly are and cared for.

Sexuality can go to some dark places and how we learn to reconcile it with our egos as we get older and bolder is kind of the point of being kinky. I think that's also why kinks like these need to be examined. 

I think if you're one gender and want to have same gender relations I think it's your prerogative and don't need a reason except it's your choice; however, I also think that some wires get crossed as a young person and although you might have a great hand on gender & sexuality fluidity it might still cross a line to do something that you aren't into but would do if coerced or compelled somehow."

After lurking occasionally, I found it kind of heartwarming to see the ladies who are embracing their lovely fertile bellies. It's oddly wholesome yet rebellious in its own right because so many things are geared toward making sure that the change in their bodies are shamed when it could be fun and joyful like our ancient ancestors used to feel. I don't think everything is for public consumption but I think that pregnancy can be sexy and fun in moments; it's not just a medium for complaints about swollen parts, nausea, worry about weight gain etc or just about how pure motherhood is and how to paint the nursery. It can be a way to celebrate life, see that we -deep down- are part of nature, and that nature is sometimes a bit naughty.  JMO"

Her behavior over the years and the unkindness she has in her darkest moments - when she is violent, ridiculing, belittling -  has really caused me pain and deep seated fear over the years. I forgive her because I love her and know why she is this way but I don't forget because I can't take the rejection anymore and she won't see her own bullshit. I never know what person I'm going to get and I'm tired of trying to guess if I have to wear armor or not."

Yes but I'd also think it would allow him some help to take care of things like replace his beater car with a newer one so he can drive to a better job and finish his master's degree - just so he could improve his circumstances. I'd probably buy a decent house and create a couple of trusts for the children in my life (I have no bio kids but some of my loved ones do) so they can go to school or buy a house if they decide to have a family. For me I'd still go to school, pay off debt and maybe a road trip once in awhile. I'd work but it would probably be more aligned with my interests than just to keep a roof. But this is to build up relationships and long term betterment. If they just want a roommate, the arrangement is fine."

They sometimes need to have their hands metaphorically slapped and reporting them is the right thing to do. You have the right to heal and to make changes in your life in order to do so. If a doctor tells us we have diabetes and we have to make lifestyle changes and medication to live, many folks would do that. It means they can't eat sweets, even if they baked cakes in the past or gave them to others as a gift, they often stop or find another way to celebrate. They can stop baking cakes and no one should demand them to continue making desserts in spite of their better judgement. We too can choose to change our lifestyle and expect people to treat us right.

That part of you asking to be treated this way could be your trauma or it could be that you are kinky but there's a better way to go about it. Consent is key for all parties and if they don't want to do it to you, that's them not giving consent and begging/coersion is not cool and is putting your trauma into someone else's life. Please lurk in some of the kink communities -not just the ones with pictures and erotic stories- but ones that engage in supportive talk about kink and teaches good practices.

Sometimes you have to run from a burning building - not everyone can be saved- and you made a very hard but very wise and mature choice. Some people aren't going to agree especially if they are in a desperate frame of mind but you can't change their mind with logic especially since logic didn't go into this choice. It's okay - even if you feel guilt - but you have to save yourself and your dad didn't put you in this spot, your mother did. It's her choice now to save herself too. 


You are too young to be having kids to care for when you should be thinking of school and life as a beginning adult; unfortunately, this WILL happen if you stayed. You are old enough to babysit, mind, and clean for them so you will be recruited - by hook or by crook. This occurs in families with multiple children no matter how good or bad the circumstances. 

You had to choose yourself and that is okay. You still have a future that is now your own. Do right by your self and make sure you stay on that path."

Dicks do what they do and sometimes have a mind of their own; in addition, the moment sometimes doesn't match how your body reacts- sometimes the moment is scary or wrong but we still get that rush. The dad sounded like he was a bro and remembered what it was like for him as a young man. It wasn't like you could do anything with his daughter at that moment anyhow. He helped you cover up and gave sound advice on boner management. My bf when he needs to control himself sometimes takes slow breaths and breathes out slowly to relax so that might help out too"

I remember internalizing in my youth that men don't need cuddles etc and therefore I skipped it to the detriment and sadness of my relationships in the past. I don't ignore that need anymore and even reach out to my partner to touch him if it feels like it has been too long in the time we're together. It's nice to hear him sigh in relief and joy in those moments. Men shouldn't have to feel like it's wrong to cuddle or need affection.
