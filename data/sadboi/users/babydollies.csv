Glaucoma,fqnb9tf,t3_gjed8z,1589491815.0,"i’ve had closed angle glaucoma since i was 18(5 years ago) im in the same boat. failed laser surgeries(1 in my ‘good eye’ which i think worked? but 2 failed in my ‘bad eye’) i think the best thing to do is find a different specialist and ask about all options. i saw a newer doctor for a second opinion, who suggested i get actual surgery in the near future as a precaution to my pressure getting worse. i hope everything works out for you. and stay safe!"
