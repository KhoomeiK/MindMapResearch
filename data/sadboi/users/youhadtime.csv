Austin,fr4xcub,t1_fr39y2w,1589898664.0,"You certainly aren’t failing your kids. If anything the government is failing you because they haven’t put a plan in place that gives us confidence in reopening childcare centers (or restaurants, churches, bars, etc.), especially considering how easily children spread germs.

You’re an essential worker so you don’t have a choice but there are many parents who do and firmly believe that it isn’t a necessary sacrifice. If you’ve read anything about the coronavirus beyond the headlines then you’d know how terrifying this virus can become. But also it’s a privilege to be able to make the choice to keep your children home and I don’t think anybody is judging essential workers for doing what’s necessary. 

I think if everyone had the means and security to stay home with their family they would choose that over dropping them off at childcare during a pandemic. As daunting as it is, you are more at risk of catching covid-19 now than in the last two months. Now is the time to take extra precautions, stay inside as much as you can and wear a mask if you’re able."

They tried to get tested and were told to just go home and self-isolate because her mother had travelled from Italy. Correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think she or her family would be counted in the coronavirus case tally if they weren’t officially tested."
Coronavirus,fr27uml,t1_fr15b0t,1589832647.0,"Making sure we have capacity in hospitals was only one purpose of the lockdown. It was also to buy time so we could secure ventilators and PPE and other supplies, buy us time to study covid-19 more, set up hospitals, get information and safety guidelines out to people and businesses and generally come up with a plan that would allow us to responsibly and safely start to reopen when the time was right. Yet our government failed and squandered the time so many of us bought them by staying at home.

People who are concerned about covid-19 when we essentially feel we’re on our own are not “doomers” and writing us off as such makes it so simple to ignore very real, very immediate concerns that are effecting millions of people in the US alone, and that one day could effect you."

psychology,fr1jmda,t1_fr0yzeo,1589820863.0,"I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and have only had good experiences with benzodiazepines, though I only use them short-term, in small doses and exactly as prescribed. 

Usually I can cope well on my own but there are times when I simply can’t. I’m generally a calm, easygoing person and I’m abnormally great in a crisis but sometimes my brain thinks there’s a major threat where there is none and no logic or deep breathing can convince it otherwise.

I was so relieved when I was first prescribed a benzo because I finally had a way to be okay when otherwise I’d have to ride out a horrifying panic attack and miss out on my life. I’d avoid situations or places where I might have a panic attack because I didn’t want to risk not being able to leave and/or acting in a way I couldn’t control.

With this medication, even if I just have it on me and don’t need to take it, gives me control and freedom I otherwise wouldn’t have. There are tons of people who don’t have an issue with it, who never use it recreationally, who educate themselves about the dangers and know how to use it responsibly.

Take my personal experience however you will. I know that a lot of people are hurt by this drug and that this conversation needs to continue to happen, especially as the world becomes a scarier, more uncertain place and we risk losing the ability to cope organically. For now, I am thankful that benzodiazepines exist and that I have access to them."

I’m staying home because I’m hopeful that a vaccine is coming and I’d rather wait inside to get vaccinated than go outside and risk getting myself and my loved ones sick. 

I’m staying home because while most of us were self-isolating our government wasted that precious time doing next to nothing to prepare for a safe reopening and now I feel going out is riskier than ever before.

So maybe flattening the curve is the “main goal” but there are many reasons we should self isolate beyond not wanting to overwhelm hospitals."

Today my grandfather told me how amazing and supportive her new hospice team was and especially those who come to bathe her, help her use the bathroom, feed her, clean up her messes, clip her nails and do her hair, etc. He has trouble giving up any control but now that he has this help he is amazed at how patient and compassionate the nurses/hospice workers are, even when they’re getting yelled at and pushed away.

Despite the seriousness of the OAP competition I (and about a dozen other people) began laughing and couldn’t stop, which set off a contagion of stifled laughter throughout the audience, kids and adults alike.

Eventually one of the musketeers pulled it to the side with a flick of his sword but by that time the rogue breast had stolen the show."

Our plans for having visitors at the nursing home, visiting her ourselves, being with her as she passed, gatherings with friends and families outside of the nursing home, rituals, last minute shopping for ourselves or guests from out of town when stores are packed and out of everything, having to screen people for risk factors before they were included in any plans because we were around elderly or at-risk people, communicating with 10+ different people daily, etc. have been so incredibly difficult to execute amongst this pandemic.

We’re currently trying to re-plan tomorrow’s funeral after a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people began this morning in our state. It’s also now unexpectedly freezing and rainy and windy and we can’t have the funeral unless it’s outside so everything just kinda sucks.

On the bright side, our “pod” of loved ones aren’t really working because of all the shut downs so we were able to all get together and give my partner’s mom a whole week of her favorite people, food, drinks, games, and shows before her health really declined.

It’s been so hard but if she had decided to continue dialysis then my partner wouldn’t be able to see her anyways because of the lockdowns on nursing homes. Only essential staff are allowed in or out unless somebody is at the end of their life and even then visitors are usually limited to a single, predetermined person.

Long lines, swag nobody really wants to touch and startups and small venues overwhelmed by frustrated people who are trying to get their money’s worth but that are ultimately disappointed by the reality of the festival.

I know you want it to be true, but please stop trying to pretend that this event will be anything like the old school SXSW. It will be the opposite of its “heyday”. It isn’t organized around startups or lesser known artists and they don’t have the money or time to change that at this point. Not to mention attendees bought their badges expecting to be dazzled by the big events, speakers, and headliners and I highly doubt out-of-towners will share your perspective of a stripped-down festival being a better deal. “I know you paid hundreds or thousands of dollars to be here and that you were expecting too see [big company or headliner who cancelled their plans] but instead let’s just be happy with this small event you’ve never heard of and that isn’t worth the price tag or risk of being here in the first place!”"

We’ll be able to track future coronavirus cases back to this festival too, and fairly quickly, so they won’t be able to place blame elsewhere. The whole world will look at Austin as a petri dish that could’ve been avoided.

But IF they do the right thing and cancel, if they choose to listen to the people instead of choosing the chance at a profit, they’ll take a hit now but in the long-term they will actually survive and probably thrive (Austinites tend to reward companies who do the right thing and we’ll show our thanks with our wallets next year when there isn’t a cloud of grim anxiety hanging over our city).

At this point, if SXSW happens, I don’t imagine things going well even if the coronavirus doesn’t touch us (which it will). I’m imagining thousands of people wandering around the city figuring out what there is to do after so many speakers/musicians/companies have pulled out. The smaller venues will be overwhelmed with people who otherwise would be at a now-cancelled event and will now have to turn people away who paid good money to be here and are already at their 3rd or 4th choice activity. Volunteers will drop out, especially if they don’t feel like a badge is worth the risk, and there will be a palpable level of fear and distrust in the air. Chaos and anger will ensue.

And then there’s the grocery stores here that are already running low on food and supplies (panic buying/stock piling) and visitors are going to make that problem so much worse. Also we definitely can’t trust people to practice basic hygiene even if we make it accessible, especially when they’ve been partying, and people will choose any SXSW event over staying home if they’re feeling ill.

I’m trying to be levelheaded about this but I don’t understand how they could be so irresponsible. Continuing on at this point isn’t good for anybody and SX owes it to attendees to cancel now so they can make arrangements. Letting it happen will turn SXSW into Fyre Fest’s close cousin.
