NoFap,fndqife,t1_fndlox7,1586875563.0,"Believe me brother I'm not rich but that's just how addiction is. From what I have read Every man wants to feel important and loved. Cam sites add more personal touch to pornography. In a private show you online you are practically talking to the girl and she would do anything to please you if you are being generous and that's the trick the cam sites do with human psychology. You would never feel like you are giving away actual money because they are converted into ' Tokens' which foggs the brain up psychologically. So your brain thinks like you are just pressing some magic button on a computer and a sexy girl is doing all the stuff your desire. (It's like your dopamine levels on steroids if that makes sense)
It's like in the same sense when you make a purchase via card it doesn't feel that bad rather than handing cash out. Because when given it physically, you feel that you have spent it. It lits up some emotional centres in the brain (I don't know the correct terminology here)
Strip clubs have figured this out decades ago, now if you ever been to a major club notice how you'd get special tip notes in most clubs around the world and not actual money. So it's like that. 
Initially cam sites would give you let's say 1000 tokens for $100, so you'd think oh it's more cheaper than any strip club and I'd spend much more on taking someone out. It's great I'm on couch and I have to do nothing and I'm being pampered üò©.
It's all a hoax. Virtual world is just a bunch of BS for me now that I have understood it.
I didn't spend it all at once on one model. From my estimate it took me about 3-4 yrs and about 1500 different models online. But yeah that doesn't justify it either. Thanks for your wishes üòä. Hugs to you brother"
