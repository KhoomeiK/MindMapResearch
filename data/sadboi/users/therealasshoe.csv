Anxiety,fpga3wa,t1_fp8ehrn,1588598246.0,"Yeah It definitely helps with my morning allergies after I take it haha. But I’ve noticed if I take it too late at night it makes it near impossible to wake up in the morning. Almost feels like I’m sleepwalking and going to collapse. Oh well. 
Thanks for the reply, much appreciated"
Anxiety,fp8e6vc,t3_gbnjuv,1588390061.0,"Abso-fucking-lutely! 
I feel like I am just starting to get used to this version of life, and my old routine seems like a distant memory. 
The thought of being thrown back into that and having to adjust to another way of living again scares the shit out of me. 
And then I feel super guilty, because of course I want this terrible virus to go away for everyone’s sake. It’s all so conflicting, but also valid. Glad to hear so many others feel the same way."
cymbalta,fixfspc,t3_fa5laz,1582819580.0,"Congrats for making it this long! 
I’ve been on 20mg for almost 2 months and I feel like I’ve definitely seen improvement in my panic attacks, but my psychiatrist/ almost everyone else who’s been on it says it’s uncommon that JUST 20mg could make any noticeable difference. I’m not sure. 
How did you make the decision to keep going up to 120? 
Did you notice increased anxiety every time you upped the dosage or just when you started the med initially?"

Rabbits,fhn7cst,t1_fhj6krj,1581722851.0,"Unfortunately, trying to argue with someone who thinks it’s fair  to compare vehicular homicide with an accidental litter is just a waste of energy. Sometimes people just need to be outraged about SOMETHING. Regardless, I appreciate your support a lot!"

Rabbits,fhj4o5g,t1_fhj3mpc,1581638091.0,"Thank you. If that person knew anything at all about rabbits, it’s very hard to determine their sex for certain before they reach a certain level of maturity, which is why I had them sexed by my veterinarian even after being told they were both females. 
That being said, I should’ve kept them separated even with DOUBLE “confirmation” that they were both females. That was my mistake that I’ll admit to. I’m human. And one that’s open to constructive criticism. But alas, all I can do is say my piece and if people choose to still be angry with me, that’s something I can’t change. I’m doing the best I can for my animals."
Rabbits,fhj3x7z,t1_fhj0dxk,1581637732.0,See ya! 👋
Rabbits,fhj0jgi,t1_fhizpkx,1581635654.0,I appreciate your kind words so much. It was a mistake that I’ll not soon forgive myself for but I took every necessary precaution I could think of.

cymbalta,fei9ia5,t1_febi07g,1579133299.0,Thanks! This is really helpful. Do you feel any different drinking on the med than you did before?
cymbalta,fdxpdin,t1_fdwr5ma,1578771512.0,"Thanks for the insight, much appreciated!"
cymbalta,fdvu320,t1_fdsjl9a,1578751511.0,Thanks so much for the response!
cymbalta,fdvtwdx,t1_fdtfbom,1578751443.0,"While this doesn’t really answer my question... I get what you’re saying. I’ve had similar thoughts. However, I wouldn’t say I was “pushed” onto anything. I have a great doctor who listens to my concerns and struggles, and for most of my childhood & entire adult life have been crippled by anxiety & panic attacks. If taking a pill once a day can help me get through the day and function as a human, I’m willing to take that risk. I’ve tried every route & method leading up to medication. 

What’s far more disturbing to me is not the prescription of SSRI/SNRI medication to young adults, but the leniency in prescriptions of benzodiazepines to young adults. Proven to be much more detrimental in the long run."
cymbalta,fdp5r1u,t1_fdmtut8,1578620635.0,Yeah my doc is planning on upping my dosage after a few weeks but wanted to start out low just to try & keep the severity of the side effects at a minimum since I have to work & such. Thanks for your reply

Took an eraser to my anxiety completely after a month or so, which I’ve seen someone say almost verbatim in this sub about the cymbalta."
cymbalta,fdm15wt,t1_fdlb5o2,1578537348.0,"Thanks for your reply, best of luck to you as well!"
OCD,ewefxzt,t3_cnqva8,1565322881.0,"YEAH lol i do the exact same shit. Also, if I run over a pothole with my right tires I feel like my car is “uneven” so I’m uncomfortable until I reach another part of the road where my left tires run over a pothole. It makes no sense but so much sense at the same time."
