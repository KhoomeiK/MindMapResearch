What kind of writing do you do?"

mentalhealth,f9ekplh,t3_e4h8x3,1575245658.0,Awesome! 9 job applications is pretty impressive. Hope it works out!
careerguidance,f8x7p9x,t1_f8v20i5,1574910540.0,Omg to have time to not do anything...I haven’t experienced that since 2008 when my job was dying. I get anxious when it’s approaching 5. Reminds me I’m staying late again.
careerguidance,f8w4zcw,t1_f8w3p67,1574883416.0,"I should mention he also works 9-11 hours per day. I don’t think he’s taking advantage per se, just not sure how to fix it. Or maybe he doesn’t realize how much it’s affecting me..."
Career_Advice,f8bxuhj,t3_e02zod,1574447829.0,"Perhaps you should look into a new therapist. I know you say you can’t afford to go to doctors really, so that’s all the more reason to find one that will actually help. I was in the same position as you. I’ve always been a late person, even since I was young. I tried all the “tricks” to get out of bed earlier, but the only thing that’s helped was getting treatment for depression. (I’m still a late person but not as much and not as late). Yea, getting up and going to work and handling responsibilities is “being an adult,” but you have a lot on your plate and dealing with everything while struggling with depression makes everything harder. Maybe your school or work has an assistance program or some other kind of free resources to get counseling or help?  Good luck."
depression,f8buxop,t3_e00pxq,1574445907.0,Same...have to say I have a stomach thing if I’m not sniffling or coughing. I don’t think people believe me.
depression,f83tp97,t3_dytad5,1574220667.0,"Ah, I feel this so much. I’ve always felt this. I get the concept of being your own number 1, but it’s not the same as being someone else’s number 1."
depression,f832fx4,t1_f827m7r,1574202946.0,Thank you. You too.
pestcontrol,f832f1y,t1_f82tmts,1574202931.0,"Wow, ok, you win...Carpet beetles, springtails, silverfish, book lice, rats, snakes, and potentially scorpions and tarantulas!....Idk how you deal with that. I’m losing my mind for real over carpet beetles (maybe moths)... 

Curious though, how do you take care of the tarantulas and scorpions in the house? You can’t just squish them like a regular bug."
depression,f80vx7v,t1_f80qazm,1574139945.0,"Same. Sometimes I just can’t make it stop... I usually go to the bathroom when I feel it getting to that point.  I share a small office with my boss. I wonder if he can tell I’m silently crying...He seems pretty oblivious, but maybe he’s just faking it to not have to deal with the situation.. I put eye drops in my eyes when that happens so if anyone sees my tears I have an excuse. 

Every day I just want to run home and cry in my bed..."
depression,f80vgjz,t3_dy4utk,1574139520.0,"I feel you. I cry in the bathroom almost every day.  Like, ugly cry. Better to cry in the bathroom than lose my shit in front of people.  Depression is seeping through as it is."
pestcontrol,f7xxgjk,t1_f7xib6t,1574079636.0,"Most of my clothes can’t be washed in hot water or dried on hot, so I’m trying to find another solution other than bringing all of my clothes to the dry cleaner. Jeans for example, if washed in hot water or dried at a high temp will shrink, but they also aren’t something you dry clean."

datingoverthirty,f3w8o4v,t1_f3w1n4q,1571194716.0,"Interesting. Why? I find it increasingly difficult to find a guy who actually wants to DATE for real. In my experience, most just want to hook up. With dating apps there’s always someone else just a swipe away. I’m not saying every guy is like that. Perhaps today’s society has made it harder for those guys who do actually want to date and get to know people and see what happens."
lonely,f3w6f21,t3_dfr43x,1571193142.0,"Happy Birthday! I know how you feel. My birthday is coming up and I’ll be alone again. Has been that way for years. I tried “celebrating” by myself one year-got a cupcake and put a candle in it, drank Prosecco, lit other candles for good energy, probably came up with an affirmation for the year. I tried to be positive but I was holding back tears when I blew out that candle. Idk what I’m going to do this year. I hate when people ask and I have to lie and make up plans or say, “I like being alone on my birthday. Time to reflect!” I still feel like a loser. So, I hear ya."
datingoverthirty,f1pvacs,t3_d8wccj,1569688712.0,"I think if you’re dealing with it, and it’s not affecting anything, then it doesn’t need to be something you talk about in the early stages of a relationship. I went through the same as you. (I was depressed most of my life, got really bad late 20s, almost lost my job, engaged in destructive behaviors...was in a really, really dark place. That was the breaking point and I finally got help and am doing better now). For me, it’s very personal. I would definitely want to share with a partner, but not until we were really in a solid, trusting relationship."
datingoverthirty,f1prvec,t3_d8lus1,1569687084.0,"We are taught to not care about money when it comes to getting to know someone and relationships, but not having a few dollars for coffee is a red flag, and thinking so is not being picky or judgmental.  Especially if he’s like you describe (30s, good job, a house, stylish, etc.). Even saying that he doesn’t  have enough money for coffee is a red flag in itself. But also, why did he not budget for coffee if he knew you were going out? Why wouldn’t he borrow a few dollars? Why so last minute? If it’s not a test (and personally, I wouldn’t want to go out with someone who tests me like that), not knowing you don’t have enough money until the last minute is an indicator of being irresponsible with money. Irresponsible in general."
