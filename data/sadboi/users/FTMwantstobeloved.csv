It would just be a thing, like what Morgan Freeman said about racism. And instead of generalizing over an etiquette, we look at individuals first, but that ain't happening. Humans are pattern seeking and like to simplify everything. It's important for people to know and understand, like a PSA. That's what should be done to give visibility.

People might feel and say we're ""shoving our ideologies down their throat"", they feel attacked by gay pride and shit. I'd like it all to be less ""flash-y"" and more ""know-y"" if that makes sense."

don't think it's the one I read but here:

> The second finding was surprising. A third to a half of ""normal"" women experience phantom breasts after a mastectomy, as opposed to only 3 out of the 29 transgender men. The third finding was downright astounding. Among the transsexual men, 18 out of 29, or 62 percent, said they had experienced a phantom penis long before their surgery

my worry is hormone imbalance from your brain needing to adapt to the changes pretty quickly (one week for an antidepressant is nothing)

you would on the long term grow tolerance, as you take the drug and your brain adapts, even if you switch it will still have some of the molecules of the other drug affecting it, takes a while to completely leave your body, then it will still remember the drug since you did take it and it did affect your brain, though it's true it depends on how long you take the drug.
