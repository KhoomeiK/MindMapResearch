askphilosophy,f5zy4al,t3_dq0m6u,1572594545.0,"Firstly, I  personally cannot imagine a scenario where we have no religion, considering science and logic take time to be perfected.

And, answering to your original question, yes, definitely. But only rituals that are strictly enforced or religions that adhere to strictness in ritual, cause this effect.

I would even go beyond this and say that the core tenets of any religion affect the overall outlook towards life/others, of people in that religious community. Bhutan would be a good example with it majority Buddhist population. 

Also, globalization undoes/erodes this effect as well. And sometimes, religions can have a ""cheat code"" in their philopshy that insulates customs/rituals from this erosion.

But then again, it's all about if your God loves you unconditionally, or under what conditions/beliefsystems can you keep your God ""on your side""."

LetsTalkMusic,f2pa8e5,t1_f2oiy5p,1570339904.0,"Woah. This is my first time hearing about stress/syllable timed languages. Just ggogled it a bit and looks like a rabbit hole for me.

Mainly becuase I was kinda thinking myself that there has to be some distinction between the phonetics/timing aspect of languages that makes some rap in some languages sound better to me than others.

About lyrics, I guess every scene will have some mature substance rappers, more so, if the scene has survived a longer period of time."
LetsTalkMusic,f291p12,t1_f28wssk,1570077326.0,Yup. Will take recs for poignant/non-gangsta rap albums. I liked Dave's psychodrama a lot. Anything similar?

TrueFilm,f1t5lov,t3_dahk1c,1569739124.0,"Loved the movie. I do agree with OP about the fact that the movie did try to distinguish between the signifier and signified in a non academic, pop culture kind of way. And kept pushing for the difference to ""not matter"" in the sport like battle rap scenario.
And about all the critisicm of the movie, it was exactly what it was trying to be.and that's fine by me for any movie. As long as it's honest. Also, all sports movies are going to have a similar clich√©d structure ; or what? You want the protagonist to lose at the end?"
