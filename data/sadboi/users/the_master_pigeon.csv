From what I’ve seen, there’s this idea amongst extreme feminism that trans women are “just men invading” their female space. But the people who believe that are just invalidating these women to further whatever “agenda” they have. It sucks.

Your boyfriend has boundaries that were unintentionally disrespected. Your explained this to your sister politely, and she probably felt embarrassed and thus upset being called out. It doesn’t make her an asshole in this situation, and you’re not the asshole because of the way you told her. 

As for everyone questioning how on eArTh is showering with your partner disrespectful, it could be a cultural thing. It’s rude to not respect the rules of someone else’s house regardless of your own beliefs. It’s not your place."
