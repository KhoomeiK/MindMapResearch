technology,fqwlfva,t3_glc7vc,1589708799.0,"I’ve owned my XR for a exactly a year. The current battery health is 98% after a year of one cycle a day. 

I’m guessing it’s not accurate as exact number these figures. I’m guessing your xr has been longer than that. 

Secondly it depends if you are streaming or playing a song downloaded to your phone. The former uses WiFi or 4G definitely drain battery faster.

But recently I notice my xr draining battery a little faster too.

Last iPhone XR continuous web browsing data according some website is just 11 hours. That’s far from 15 hours. I got 30% left after 6 hours playing music on and off plus daily usage. That’s kinda accurate I think

Edit: I’m planning to get a battery replacement after year two. It’s just 4 hours in my country and it’s not even that expensive in official reseller service. 8% of the cost of new XR"
FinalFantasyVII,fnz2evc,t3_g4grm3,1587384094.0,"I am a fan of FF7 and all its subsequent games and movies such as Advent Children and Crisis Core. I always feel like with so many different games, alot questions were left unanswered. Such as the relationship with Aerith and Zack. Did aerith knows what happened to zack? Clearly this question was answered in the Remake. 

To add, Remake was beautiful and fun. For instance, I did not enjoy FFXV because i think the game was not fully developed. The part of lake battle with Leviathan was so horrible, the graphics and the whole game mechanics. BUT in Remake, the same kind of battle while interacting with environment towards the end was superbly executed. There was no loss of graphics at all.

So all in all, I welcome the changes because it added value to the current story. If its 1:1 remake i think it would be boring because there are many story being develop after 1997 and now Remake makes the story coherent."
ipad,fn7bcn0,t1_fn6vztl,1586716974.0,"I use a Surface Laptop 3 with the Bluetooth adapter for PS4 controller for remote play. 

I played from a distance of 20 KM from my house where my PS4 is. Wired PS4. My WiFi internet speed on my laptop is 400MBps though due to top commercial package.

Sometimes it straight up doesn’t connect if the line is congested. But 80% of the time it works flawlessly. 

Must be connected to 5GHz network for it to work. Normal WiFi just won’t do. Neither does 4G or hotspot. Those connection will break up in matters of minutes.

I tried many ways of remote play. From phones, purchasing a brand new Vita. I think the WiFi chip of your streaming device is very important. Vita WiFi chip just won’t do. And my router must be near to my table without any physical interference. Let’s say I sit to next cubicle in another room, the speed of 5GHz WiFi drop to 80Mbps, it straight won’t connect."

Myfitnesspal,f7dclgp,t3_dvkpi4,1573613246.0,It just appear on my feed. I didn’t even notice it’s MyFitnessPal sub. Sorry
Myfitnesspal,f7danxh,t3_dvkpi4,1573611858.0,I use Lose it app and it has Apple Watch integration
Weightlosstechniques,f7d9suf,t1_f7cmsso,1573611244.0,I second this. I track my calories intake with Lose it because it has much better interface than Myfitnesspals but both works. I only do 30 mins of exercise running or walking but eating way below budget calories. I’m still losing 1.5-2 pounds a week so far within the month I started.
loseweight,f7d84d0,t3_dv8mwm,1573610050.0,"Try using myfitnesspals or lose it app to log your calories intake. It works better than eating one meal a day. You can have multiple meals with lower calories and still losing 2 pounds a week. To me Calories in vs calories out (CICO) works.

I Try to combine some activity daily with an activity tracker (Apple Watch). It tells me I burn 2600-3000 calories a day and I’m only eating 1500-1800 calories per day. That’s two smaller meals and some fruits and coffee. I also aim to workout at least 30min every day walking or running.  So far I lost 8 pounds within a month."
AppleWatchFitness,f7d7hj0,t1_f7cz320,1573609587.0,Did you calibrate your Apple Watch? I notice my watch count less calories after several calibration. I don’t do yoga but walking calories is quite accurate.
