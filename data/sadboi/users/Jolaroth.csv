Stoicism,fpnnvis,t1_fpnlt8d,1588768496.0,"Well, I think a part of them did still want to be saved.  But in your scenario, they actually KNOW that no one can.  So they feel that obligation to end there suffering I guess?

I'm just trying to make sense of what he said, not sure how I feel about all the content of his post.  If anything, I think it's a little overly dramatic is all I can say for certain.

Also, stoicism claims that no matter how you die you can do so with dignity. That's all within.  I also remember one of Seneca's letters where he was contemplating suicide, being older in age, having lived a full life, but now being terribly physically uncomfortable.  It was as if it was a totally reasonable and casual topic.  ""I'm ready to take my leave I think"" kind of tone.  But, he said that sticking around a little longer for the sake of his loved ones - and that alone - was enough to endure the discomfort.

So which is more noble/dignified, ending ones life on ones own terms to maintain some personal image or sense of pride?  Or staying strong until the very end as long as you are able physically/mentally able to FOR those people closest to you in your life.  Assuming that's what those people wanted of course. (For you to stay alive as long as possible) However, some of your loved ones of course may see your pain and understand, or not want to see your suffer anymore, depending on the situation etc.

She may not even think it's something she needs to process and continues to tuck it away.  It could be a lesson she needs to learn, that she may not learn until years down the road, if ever.

Stoicism,fmbi2hk,t1_fmabsfj,1585926791.0,"I agree. This is very interesting.  Stoicism normally advocates getting rid of fears as a motivator.  So at first I was confused as to how one can act in accordance with this while using fear of regret at the end of ones life as motivation.

But I think it works because of the nature of what he is fearing.

He fears his own internal judgement of himself based on his actions in relation to his values, which according to stoicism, is the only thing we SHOULD be concerned with.  The only thing we can truly control.  Whereas a fear of death itself is external and irrational.

I guess where I'm still getting hung up, is on the fact that being motivated to do anything out of fear, regardless of the source, doesn't sounds like a happy way of living to me.  However stoics claim achieving this naturally rewards one with a never ending peace and contentment."

Now, taken in a stoic context this is good and makes sense with things like externals. The problem is most of us by default don't want to take responsibility for ANYTHING, even those things that, by stoic principles, are considered within our control.

I think you can see how blaming what is in your control on others (to justify to yourself that it's not you that needs to change, it's the other person/scenario who's to blame) can be very detrimental to personal development.

""This is not an ideal situation. I would like it to change, but it's not my fault this happened.  And thus it's not my responsibility to take action.

TheMindIlluminated,fj6vztu,t1_fj0s1av,1583081355.0,"I would be very interested in hearing you elaborate on the lack of confidence part...  

I've known on some level that I have low self esteem for some time now.  Since my childhood.

But recently, the implications of that are becoming more and more apparent.  Lack of self-love/self-confidence (do you think they are two sides of the same coin?) I feel is my biggest issue across all areas of my life and I keep getting led back to it through different avenues of thought and contemplation.

I've been trying to incorporate metta into my practice, but I just feel like I'm not getting anywhere.  I don't know how to help myself in this area...  I've accomplished so much and yet I'm so hard on myself...  I'm really just trying to de-tangle this mess of consciousness I've built up to this point...

Also I appreciate your reflection on the importance of definitions and language.  It's an area I'm definitely not great in but it keeps coming up the more thoughts and conversations of this type I have.

But I also think you're going a little hard on my teacher.  This language stuff gets deep quick and even just starting to realize the implications of language and definitions on our consciousness is more than enough for me at least to get confused and lost in a wormhole of thought.  Like you said, when definitions get confusing, communication breaks down and then even continuing that thread of the conversation can be difficult.  It's like, once you've identified that both of you are using words completely differently it feels like you can't even communicate on the same level anymore.  So it's not the easiest concert to be fully aware of and implement successfully, in my opinion.  Although definitely very important, I agree with you there.  Also many might get completely lost in/not understand that concept of definitions, language, and communication in the first place.

Anyway if you could elaborate on the doubt and lack of confidence bit I would really appreciate it, but thanks for your contribution in general.  Just the inclusion of that last line gave me some more insight.  One more thread a little more unraveled..."

Now that I've changed my lifestyle, lost weight and gotten a lot healthier, it's like a whole new world for me to explore.

It's still very challenging for me though, as believe it or not, just getting into shape isn't enough to heal years of habitual self loathing/anxiety.

So one, I noticed a negative self reaction to you saying that going out and getting sex is easy, as if it's like picking up alcohol from the liquor store or going and buying weed.  Unless you were referring to masturbation as well?  This makes me feel bad about myself, as I don't find sex a very easy thing to come by, even though I desire it, am actively seeking it out, and I'm a pretty attractive guy.  And the fact that you said it's been two months like that's a long time to go without it, whereas that seems like a normal length of time to go without having sex to me, even WHILE actively seeking it out.  Now I know this desire I have is partially because I'm somewhat attached/addicted to external justification (probably because of my low self esteem: I'm looking for external proof that I'm a likable/good person).  I'm also in a -less than ideal- geographical area for succeeding in this endeavor, so that could also be why I perceive it as being more difficult.  I guess my standards for physical attraction could be making my pursuit more difficult as well.

Two, I realize how this yearning and trying and failing and negative self talk are causing me suffering because I'm chasing after it, but I also feel like it's a healthy area for me to push myself and grow in.  Develop more social ability.  But it also feeds that part of me that desires pleasure, a part I already struggle with greatly with other substances/vices.

I don't really know what answers I'm looking for but I'd be interested to hear anything you have to say about what I've said.  I guess if I had to condense it into a question it would be something like: ""What is excessive sensuality, am I hurting myself by proceeding as I am?  Do the benefits of abstinence outweigh the benefits - that I specifically would gain - of improving my social ability, social confidence, confidence in general, exploring my underdeveloped sexuality, learning what kind of people I like to be in a relationship with (my ""type""), what a healthy relationship looks and feels like, etc.?"" I suppose I should really be looking elsewhere for the confidence thing, because as long as I'm dependent on external sources for confidence it won't be genuine, but also maybe just proving to myself that I am desirable and lovable and deserving of love externally would gain me some permanent internal confidence. And what about all those other potential benefits? Idk.. and sorry for rambling...  Been fairly unstable recently and it's difficult to to form my thoughts coherently on things of this topic...

In my minimal experience it's a long and arduous process of reshaping a lot of what you have inherently come to believe up until this point.  It's like breaking bad habits/addictions that you've built up your whole life - not so easy to do.

But Independence from suffering at the hands of the external world makes striving towards that goal worth it for myself and many others here.

But it ain't easy, that's for sure.  And if you attempt to follow this path, it'll probably get worse and uglier before it gets better.  (Again, at least in my experience)

It means that no matter what happens, what anyone else does to us externally, it does not need to make us miserable.

At the same time, stoics always upheld doing the right thing to the best of your judgment/ability in every situation.  This means paying attention to the needs of others and acting best to suit those needs fairly and justly for all parties involved.

So deriving all the joy you need from yourself ≠ focusing only on your own desires and getting what you want, it means never letting external happenings cause you misery.  So if your partner in this situation did something that would normally hurt you, you have all the joy you need within yourself, and shouldn't allow it to hurt you.  That says nothing about being compassionate, aware, and proactive towards the needs of others.  

Initially you said this wisdom led you astray, but then later edited that to say that you misused the wisdom.  I think this is a better summary of what happened.  Misuse, rather than misguidance."
Stoicism,fi6riqg,t3_f5rxya,1582205500.0,"Very interesting.

I remember reading somewhere about ancient Greeks, and perhaps even some of the stoics themselves (Marcus even?) submitting themselves to the ""Greek training"".  This consisted things like voluntarily sleeping on cold, hard, marble without blankets or pillows (furs?) with the intention of strengthening ones will and mitigating fears  of potential future physical and other types of discomfort.

I also feel like I remember reading about other philosophers who chose to live life in poverty, bad clothes, simple food, life in the streets, etc. Even when they didn't need to for similar reasons.  Mitigate the fear of one day becoming homeless, realizing something along the lines of ""Is this what I was so worried about? I can handle this.  It's not preferable, sure, but certainly tolerable"".

In general, I and many others believe it's important to force yourself into situations that make you uncomfortable for personal growth.  Getting comfortable with discomfort, if you will.  For most true growth happens outside of our comfort zone, a place we can so easily get subconsciously trapped within.  Things like Wim Hof's cold showers, even working out regularly when you really don't want to, all are examples of this idea.  I've also seen other modern versions of things like this where people will go one month by choice without a car, or phone, or the internet, to show themselves what it would be like to live without these things and strengthen their resolve.  For me this most often comes about in the form of putting myself into discomforting social situations that make me anxious.  

This could be similar to what others have said though about facing phobias, and the benefit may only come because you are facing fears you already have.  Social anxiety, the fear of becoming homeless, or not being able to afford a phone, or car, or Internet.  Unless you have a latent fear of the things that happen to the people in these videos happening to you (which seems like an uncommon fear to have, even subconsciously), you may not get that same benefit that you would from facing more generalized, realistic fears and situations we all have on some level.

All this being said, I'd tread carefully if I were you.  There are some fuuuucked up videos out there. I personally can't watch that shit."

I think I've been telling myself that ""I deserve to do this or that thing that I know is bad for me, because I'm sad and going through a tough time"".

Stoicism,fgsgsl3,t1_fgs1wsq,1581083915.0,"I think I'm already using this technique somewhat.. but my worry is that visualizing positive outcomes, while relieving me temporarily, also kind of marries me to those positive outcomes.  Then, when they don't happen, I am even more devastated than if I had anticipated the bad outcomes.  That's why the ideal scenario in my opinion is working to stop thoughts about the past and future altogether (or as much as possible), be them positive or negative, and just live in the present moment with zero expectations.  Just taking things as they come mindfully, and responding rather than reacting to them.  This, to me, seems to be the most logical way to end suffering.

Certainly nowhere near planning, and I honestly don't think I ever could actually do it.  But the thoughts aren't fun.  

I planned on going to a therapist in the first half of last year, before I even got involved with this girl.

Stoicism,fgpygkk,t1_fgps55w,1581014416.0,"Yeah that's great and I appreciate the attempt but I've been meditating every day for like a year and a half.

Little things rarely bother me unless I'm already unstable over a bigger thing.  In this case, it's unrequited love towards a person who acted like they liked me more than they obviously really did, really didn't treat me that well, and whose word was absolute shit.  We were never officially together, just on and off for like 6 months.  Now I'm pretty sure she's seeing someone else and just replaced me.  Just like that.  Granted, I don't blame her for any of it.  She didn't hurt me intentionally.  But I'm very hurt.  I'm so lonely.  I can't even be happy for others in relationships.

Glad it's a big accomplishment for you to let go of things like your fiance leaving the seat up.  I wish I could let go of the suicidal thoughts over a girl I was never even that serious with and who didn't treat me well.  And my life as a whole isn't bad either.  It's just this one thing that I can't fucking get over.  That I'm letting fucking ruin me.  Just a fucking girl, something so small, I get so mad at myself for being so weak. People have it way worse than I do, and I fall apart over this? Get your fucking shit together, maybe if I wasn't so pathetic she would have wanted to be with me.  Etc, etc ,etc

The negative thought cycle continues and I feel worthless.  I'm way too hard on myself, but I can't stop.  I'm not an unattractive person.  I've achieved a lot and completely changed my life for the better.  I know on some level that I deserve someone that treats me better.  That the real issue is probably personal problems she has that keep her from understanding herself and opening up to me or connecting with me. Or just the timing, or a combination of all these things.  My actions, hers, timing.

I have done a lot of deep thinking about it.  And I think it has helped but fuck I just can't stop falling into that terrible negative thought loop and feeling absolute despair even though I know the thoughts aren't true.

I don't know where I'm going with this anymore.  Just venting I guess.  I'm sorry if I was hostile at the beginning.  I truly am happy for you and your fiance and hope everything goes well for you.

What steps do I need to take to quell these thoughts that come and take hold without notice.  ""Just do it"" if I could I would have. ""At any moment we have the ability to instantly change any thought, any impression, and end our suffering, what a gift"" -Marcus (far from the proper wording, but something to that effect, if I remember correctly, multiple times throughout the meditations) well it doesn't seem to work that way for me.  Sometimes, sure I can change my views and give myself some relief.  Think my way out of the distress.  But this is mentally exhausting and doesn't always work. Then a minute later those intrusive thoughts come rushing right back.  Un-summoned. And now I have to attempt the difficult meta cognitive process again, it's a lot.  There is no switch you can flip.  But there must be practices one can do to gradually work on getting there.  Actual, physical, and mental tasks that will slowly retrain these terrible mental habits we've formed our whole lives. What. Are. They.  Epictetus says himself that studying the writings of philosophers doesn't get you any closer to the goal.  It just makes you more knowledgeable about them.  You have to DO IT, is essentially what he says.  Do WHAT? All these ideas presented by the stoics are great and wonderful and desirable (lol, supposed to be eliminating desires), but they don't really give many practical steps to get there. REBT supposedly has this, but I've yet to do enough research on it/apply it's techniques.  Still, a lot of talk from these old guys, not a lot of practical advice though.  Maybe I am doing it right and it just takes time to get there.  There's gotta be a better, faster, way though.  If only we could actually speak to them. 😔 This is hard."
Stoicism,fgp4yqy,t1_fgp4a8p,1580996968.0,"How can one hang on to something tightly and then let it go lightly? From my understanding stoicism is about reducing attachment to things, so that you are able to let them go lightly.  Holding on tightly makes letting go lightly very difficult at least.

I'd like to see it as: when you have something, fully appreciate it and enjoy it and put as much effort into it as you deem suitable, but realize you probably won't have it forever, and to be prepared to lose it.

Still, I wouldn't call the first part of that interpretation ""holding on tightly"" that implies fear of losing that thing.  Again, making letting go much more difficult."
Stoicism,fgb592z,t1_fga8645,1580658675.0,"The thing is, ""enough"" is what you decide ""enough"" is.  Sorry to hear you're going through a tough time, but you could still apply stoic philosophies.  Basically, if you decide - and truly believe (not easy to get there in my minimal experience) - that whatever you have, is ""enough"" then it is indeed enough.  

Right now I'm struggling with loneliness.  The idea of other people having families makes me sad, even though I'm well aware of the difficulties and strife that can come with relationships and families, because I don't know if I'll ever get to have one.  But the desire to not be lonely, to have a significant other, makes me discontent.  I can't bring myself to believe that being alone right now is ""enough"" and so, I suffer mentally. 

Whereas someone in your situation is probably tantalized by the idea of being on your own again.  It would solve all your problems right? Then you'd have enough.  Now let's say by some hypothetical circumstance, that causes no harm to you or you family, you ended up in that position.  Well, stuck with the mindset of never having ""enough"" you'd soon probably fall into a similar mindset that I have.  Loneliness.  Missing your family.  Etc.  Because your are married to that mentality of never having ""enough"".  

Things could always be better.  They could always be worse.  Or, to make it even more stoic, our situation could always be more preferable, or less preferable.  But that doesn't mean we have to attach our happiness to those potential alternatives.  We can be happy with what we have right now, realizing that no matter where we are, there could always be ""more"" to strive for.  And that striving or ""needing/wanting"" things to be better, is where the suffering resides."

Stoicism,fg53ir1,t1_fg528g3,1580517374.0,"Well the quote does say ""with no OTHER judgements"" so it is at least recognizing that saying it is a bent tree is a judgement.  But I see where you're coming from.

Perhaps it's more of a warning that letting judgements run rampant, without awareness, can lead to subconsciously establishing beliefs that will unexpectedly cause you distress down the road.  However, it does say specifically not to make any further judgements, which for a human judging a human, as opposed to a tree, is virtually impossible.  I agree with you on that as well.

Regardless, I'd say this quote leans more towards mindfulness than stoicism, however the two subjects, and the quote itself, obviously have a good bit of overlap.

Acting against Hitler because it is what Justice calls for is one thing, letting what Hitler did (or what a modern contemporary is DOING) anger you, upset you, etc, to a point where you are reacting to emotions rather than responding logically and calmly to situations, are two completely different things.

Obviously a murder is a bad situation, but they aren't thinking of it as bad in that moment, they simply want to figure out what happened.

But also the prognosis for where I'm at currently isn't great either.  Cut myself off from her, and get launched into a torturous pit of sadness, obsession, and despair for an average of 3 years over a girl who really hasn't given me shit...

OR, try and keep fighting to get the reciprocation I want, and HOPE that that reduces the obsession and the limerence (it may not, I may also never achieve that reciprocation from her).  While if course working to better my mindsets and live in the moment etc, etc. This option is much more appealing to me in my current state, it involves hope and uncertainty, which limerence thrives in.  And that uncertainty includes the chance and the hope that I'll get what I want eventually.

Either of these options after a long time could end up in a lot of emotional pain, keeping me from even going after other girls for YEARS, and then after I finally do meet someone else I could end up right back in the grip of a fresh new limerence, due to shit that could have happened to me during my childhood...

I know the only way I'll ever truly be able to enjoy her company (and maintain whatever relationship we have) without these anxious thoughts is to let go of my attachment, accept that she isn't mine, will never be (even if we were together officially) and that I can't control her actions.

Marcus frequently talks about doing the right thing for all of humanity, not just for himself.  Not caring about what others think means doing whatever you want for your own benefit which just makes you a selfish asshole.

Especially in a world that is more social than ever, and being a social species, we must care about what others think.  We can't survive without one another.  But we don't need to allow what others think to destroy our equanimity and perspective on life as a whole.

So the stoics thought you ""needed"" to act in accordance with nature to have an enjoyable life? I really am getting caught up on ""need""

What do we ""need"" for what? The things we need for an enjoyable existence is the assumed context I suppose.  But going beyond that the things you ""need"" to simply exist would be only food, water, and sleep/ the proper environmental conditions.

Assuming the context is ""all humans need for an enjoyable life"", I still think just maintaining your own mental fortitude is the only thing you would truly ""need"" to enjoy life from a stoic perspective.

View your situation as an opportunity to test your strength, your ability to not let this unfortunate situation derail your equanimity.  It will most certainly happen, but just continue to remind yourself when you lose your cool that this is an opportunity to grow.

Also try feeling bad for your boss.  He is obviously very unhappy and lost in this world. This is the view I always try to take when dealing with unsavory people.  They do wrong out of ignorance.

And I will repeat what others have said, exercise and meditation go a long way, but take time to have noticable effect.  I have completely changed my body physically and have never been to a gym. Granted I have more space at home than a trailer, but you should be able to find somewhere to do some calisthenics.  Body weight exercise is awesome.

Grain of salt: I'm certainly no expert and fairly new to stoicism myself. I've only read one translation of the meditations and one translation of Seneca's letters.  Both of which were the penguin classics versions."
