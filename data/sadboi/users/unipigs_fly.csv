For the middle core piece (which usually ends up about 1-2.5 cm thick depending on variety), we make a single incision so that we can pull the skin off and just chew around the core. 


For the two fleshy butt pieces, we do not peel. We use a knife to cut a grid pattern (or tic tac toe board, if you will) into the fleshy non-skin side of the mango. Then we invert the mango with our hands. By doing this, the flesh part is separated into cube-ish pieces, but still held together by the peel.
