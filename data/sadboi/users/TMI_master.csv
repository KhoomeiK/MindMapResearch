MadeMeCry,fqesw2e,t3_giilpe,1589313047.0,"The thought even crossed my mind that I’m going to hate myself if something happens to her and I didn’t call. Did I call? Of course I didn’t fucking call because I’m a fucking idiot. Now instead of being sad that we lost her I’m more selfishly sad for my idiot self. 

In shitty defense of myself, she had been in and out of the hospital so many times over the past 5 years or so that I almost got tired of hearing about it. She was a frequent flier there. 

I saw her and my cousins frequently when I was a kid, but my mom’s sisters have gotten into so many fights over the years and I never knew who was talking (or not talking to) whom. Just having to worry about saying the wrong thing because I don’t know the dynamics of their drama was enough to make me avoid being around any of my aunts or cousins much.

Somehow, it usually ended up that each of them were talking to only 2 of the other sisters, with each of them not talking to one of them. Like my mom would only be talking to aunt A and B but aunt A would talk to my mom and Aunt B. Aunt B would talk to aunt A and aunt C, but not my mom. Etc. And it would change over the years! If my mom got into a fight with aunt A, she’d then be on good terms with aunts B and C, and I had to walk on eggshells if I was talking to any of my cousins who are children of aunt A.

In retrospect I know I shouldn’t feel so bad. For some reason, the death of someone I was not as close as to as I should have been has usually caused me more pain than the death of someone I was close to."

Theft is good cause, but from what I’ve read... just apply. Your employer might not even respond. They might not have enough manpower to spare for someone to attend an appeal hearing. Just do it. The onus is on your employer to show good cause, not on you to show it wasn’t. Plenty of employers don’t even show up/get on the conference call. Just make sure you provide info for the corporate headquarters of the company rather than the location you work at, as corporate is probably overloaded with work right now, bogged down by other claims, and disorganized due to many people working from home."

TwoXSex,flynrr6,t1_flwnnv2,1585605618.0,"I’m just wondering, because I’m definitely the jealous type and have been told I’m ridiculous for being upset when my boyfriend gets flirtatious with other women, but does he flirt with other women? And if so, does that bother you? If not, would it bother you if a friend showed you video evidence of him doing so? 

I saw my boyfriend look at his phone flirtatiously when he was messaging a girl he only knew from work and who I knew fit his very specific “type” which is overrepresented in his porn. That drove me up a wall. He gave his phone the bright red face flirtatious smile and bright shiny eyes look he gave me at the beginning of our relationship that I had not seen in a long time, and that was not gonna fucking fly. 

Everyone tells me I’m just totally crazy, so I’m trying to get a feel of whether that’s true or not. Lol"
TwoXSex,flymvl4,t3_frlwhn,1585605137.0,"My boyfriend told me straight up on the first “date” (we were actually sitting at a bar with a gay friend I had already agreed to go out with when he asked me to go out last minute) that he lost his virginity to a prostitute in Amsterdam because after the shit he saw constantly in the trauma department where he worked (young people dying, etc), he didn’t want to die a virgin, and was already 24 (25 maybe?). He also said he didn’t have the confidence to approach women and that he was given advice that a prostitute might help him get over some of that.

It pissed me off because I liked him and wouldn’t have minded being his first (and I knew him at the time he had done it, just a few months prior..)  Also because, although I’m open to regulated sex work  for safety reasons because I know men will do it whether it’s legal or not, men USING those services ultimately still disgusts me to the core (I find men’s dependence on sex in general to be disgusting though, tbh). 

How did I make peace with it? I think I was impressed that he was so up front and honest about it, and took it as a sign that he had fairly serious intentions. 

I also felt like if he was able to open up to me about something like that, then he surely wouldn’t be the type to lie about trivial things right? right?? (WRONG, totally fucking wrong. Don’t ever be fooled by someone like that. They can tell you the deepest shit you can imagine, lulling you into a false sense of security, and then BAM you find out they can lie to you about the most banal thinfs. WHY would you lie to me about some bullshit when you were able to reveal your deepest secrets to me?? Shit, it probably wasn’t even the whole truth and he just wanted to feel like he got it off his chest without actually telling me everything).

I think it helped that I knew him through a mutual friend for a year or so, although we weren’t very close. If some random dude on a first date told me he lost his virginity to a prostitute I don’t think it would have gone the same way at all.

He’s also never going to travel to Amsterdam or any other place where prostitution is readily accessible without me. No more international travel alone with his brothers... I appreciate the honesty but he definitely fucked up when he told me that his brother, who was in a LTR at the time, planned the whole thing and ALSO had sex with a prostitute."
TwoXSex,flushjq,t1_flghbuw,1585509105.0,"Why “of course”? I’ve always been more comfortable wearing bras to bed, even underwire bras.

But the raw nipples are actually painful 😣
TwoXSex,flurlte,t1_flg9kfl,1585508572.0,"Source? I’ve heard all kinds of things about underwire bras (cancer—totally false, etc) but why would they be bad for your back?"
TwoXSex,flur791,t3_foooe6,1585508331.0,"28/F I hear this so often but I just don’t feel that. 

I am definitely more comfortable in a sports bra than a regular bra, but I can usually wear underwire bras constantly, including to bed, and they don’t bother me at all unless the bra is getting old, or if I’ve outgrown it or something. Not only does it not bother me, but I’ve always preferred wearing bras to bed (even underwire bras with or without padding). 

The primary reason I prefer wearing bras constantly except when showering is I just don’t like feeling them flop around. I don’t like the feeling of the weight pulling down on my chest skin or how they look saggy/droopy at the end of a braless day. I gained about 20 lbs recently and I feel all of that even more now and have noticed small stretch marks forming when I do... I’m a 38C, maybe more of a 40B or 40C now because I gained weight, so it’s not like I have huge floppy boobs. 

I think I’m also ultra conscious of how they get pushed together when I sleep on my side (which is mostly how I sleep) and I don’t want to have wrinkles on my chest [like this](https://www.littlethings.com/how-to-prevent-chest-wrinkles/) any earlier than I need to! At 28, I already am starting to get fine wrinkles in that area, noticeable when I lie on my side. 

I’ve always had some degree of sensory issues, which seems odd because people with sensory issues shouldn’t like wearing bras.... but once I got used to wearing bras, I hated the flopping and pulling skin sensation wayyyy more than the bra itself.

Finally, if I do go braless for more than just one night, my nipples get rubbed RAW by whatever shirt I’m wearing. It’s genuinely painful! Do you guys not experience this? Do you wear nipple protectors when you go braless? 

I also want to note that I only wear satiny-feeling bras. I don’t wear lacy bras that might itch. [This is my absolute favorite bra](https://www.maidenform.com/shop/maidenform/maidenform-demi-t-shirt-bra). 

Have you guys not tried bras specifically made for comfort? I don’t mean to sound condescending but I know some women who only wear sexy designed bras even under normal clothes with no intention of being intimate with anyone, and although I know they can make you feel sexy, they’re certainly not always comfortable!! Also, younger women and teenagers like those cheaply made yet unreasonably expensive bras from places like Aerie. It’s been a long time since I fit into those, but I never found them comfortable."
ptsd,fl24abe,t1_fl1y8ie,1584742611.0,"Agreed. If you want to see some disturbing stuff, look through a google image search of “tiny xxx,” “xxxtra small,” etc.

Most of it is just generally petite women paired with men who look like giants. Some of it is obviously petite adults with small boobs, but a good portion of it is girls that genuinely look like they have not even remotely started puberty. I know there are endocrine disorders out there that can cause an 18 year old to still look like a child, and that might be true for a minority of it, but I extremely highly doubt that’s what all of it is.

I’m sure people will argue with me that it’s fine as long as they are over 18, but 1) it’s still fetishizing children because they look like actual children, and that is absolutely not ok, and 2) being sexually mature has just about 0 correlation to being emotionally mature. The one girl I know who did have a condition that caused extremely delayed puberty was 1000% behind the rest of my class mentally and emotionally.

But tbh even the “xxxtra small” stuff that features sexually mature 18 year olds who are just extremely petite is absolutely disturbing to me. The reason men are attracted more to petite women is because that is a “youthful” trait. The same way blonde hair is a youthful trait. The vast majority of natural blonde hair does not survive puberty. It’s hard wired in men. They’ll tell you “youthful doesn’t necessarily mean child,” because they won’t admit to it, they most certainly would gladly have sex with children if there were no laws against it. I don’t even know how anyone can argue against that considering how frequent it is in countries where child marriage is legal and how frequently it occurred everywhere before modern times."
