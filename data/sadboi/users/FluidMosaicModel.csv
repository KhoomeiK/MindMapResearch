If you're insecure about your legs maybe try trimming them a bit and work your way down to shaving over the course of a week? That way, if you dont like it, it wont take forever to grow back.

Also, you should do what you like and not be so concerned with whether or not girls (or boys) will like it. I think confidence is everything, so if your exuding confidence we won't care at all if your legs are smooth. Confidence beats everything :)

Whether something is right or wrong is up to the individual.

E.i Honor rape/marry-your-rapist law, Genital mutilation, human sacrifice, child marriage. All these things were done because they were the ""Right"" thing to do. Some of these things still happen **because in those societies/cultures its normal, its okay, and moral.** We live in a society where *some* of these things are okay (Genital mutilation...or circumcision. And Im referring to child circumcision, not consenting adults.) Stoning people, most notably apostates & gay people still happens today, particularly in 3rd world countries because people consider it morally correct & an obligation.

Now that culture is out of the way we can talk about context.

Would it be okay to steal from the grave of someone whose actions were worse than stealing? i.e. stealing flowers from Ted Bundys grave? Benito Mussolinis grave? What about a child rapists grave?

What about another thought expiriment?

If an all powerful person with connections said ""Steal flowers from a cemetery or Ill kidnap 5 children from a 3rd world country and force them into a human trafficking ring"", would you steal flowers?

What would be moral? **Not** stealing and letting 5 anonymous children from another part of the world be forced into slavery? Or **stealing,** saving these five children?

&#x200B;

Of course, we all have different morals.

Im okay with stealing from cemeteries. Would I steal from an old, weak person who has nothing to lose? No. They're suffering enough.

Would I steal from an old, powerful person who can take a small loss? Yes, they can handle it.

I urge you to deconstruct morality. Everything you think is right may be wrong, and all you think is wrong may be right.

When you deconstruct morality enough you realize that right & wrong dont exist, and your only moral compass is your own, subjective opinion.

&#x200B;

And to  answer your question, 'I dont condone acts of pedophilia because if every child was sexually abused and it was common, most would grow up to be severely traumatized and mentally ill- slowing down society.'

But paedophilia has been a thing in many religions like Islam, where its okay. Many third world countries condone it also. Herd morality, dude."

Assuming you invest properly with good financial advice you can get, more or less 7-20% return yearly. That is, if your okay with some risky investments.

Having a diverse portfolio with low risk & high risk investments is a sure fire way to make serious money. 

The low risk investments slowly increase and arent volatile, so you wont make alot. 

The high risk investments are volatile and can make you ALOT of money, but you can also lose alot of money. 

For example, I got a 28% return investing cryptocurrency, which is risky & mental. I only invested 100$ AUD so of course I only made 28$ but still, **if** I invested 1000$ That would have been 280$. 10,000= 2,400$. 100,000=24,000$. etc etc. It very easily could of have went the other way and I could have lost that so, yeah.

If you put 1/5 of your 500k in risky investments and 4/5 in safe investments you could easily make a million in a few years.

Its been 5 months since my FP (favourite person/person bpd people idealize) spoke to me, but these feelings are so... consistent? constant? I dont know, but these feelings are kept in motion through intrusive thoughts, love, hatred, etc. Its self fulfilling cycle I guess.

 Feelings--> thoughts-->focus on FP-->more feelings-->more thoughts--> more focus on fp etc etc.

Basically, these 5 months- my emotions have not changed. If I saw her in the street all my emotions would be as if everything happened the day before. What Im saying is, a year, 2 years, however long, means nothing to him. These things he's feeling is his daily mood. You change moods daily I assume, bad days, good days, you get sad, happy angry. You think about dinner, your S/O and how you want to spend time with them, you think about your hobbies. **BUT**, someone *like* your stalker (me, for example) has all those moods/emotions hourly & you **are the subject of all those mood swings.** Emotional regulation is a bitch, good thing Im ~~suffering~~ experiencing apathy rn lol.

It may take him a few more years to get over you, it took me 2 years to get over her. Then she trusted me again in 2019 and it was smooth sailing till i became obsessed with her, over the course of 3 days lol.

I going on a rant and forgot the main point of this- I think it was that 1 year may feel like alot to you because you experience a wide range of emotions/moods/meet new people, but the stalker doesnt. You (metaphorically) put different spices/different amounts on different meals- he puts a fucktonne of everyspice on everymeal.

Bad analogy... uh, oh yeah- I forgot to say in my first comment, Im sorry you're going through this- Im also not trying to justify his behavior, what he's doing is extremely wrong and I can't imagine what it must be like to be on the receiving end of this.

And yeah, walks help- But when you've sat in bed for a few months, only standing to eat & piss your legs arent exactly fit to go on decent walks.

I feel so useless 😓"

She was with her sister always because they were close... I was jealous, rude, angry because I 'loved' her.

BPD love is so... weird, isnt it? Our love is more akin to 'limerence', although is isnt always romantic.

egg_irl,fmd1s5m,t1_fm94ly5,1585957439.0,"Growing breasts would be more difficult I think- Because you know, breasts have glands in them. And the ear is just skin & cartilage.

But if we can grow titties on someone without mammary glands (biological males), I think we could grow them on another animal. They just wouldnt be fully functional (producing milk & stuff).

Im not a scientist, I could be wrong. 

And if it is possible I want my titties to be medium sized. I dont want big tiddies or small tiddies. Like goldilocks, I want my tiddies to be *just right*."
