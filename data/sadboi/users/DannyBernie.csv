It will get better, I went from being a suffer in silence kind of person to who I am now. I'm even using my real name on Reddit and talking about my mental health because opening up and talking is what put me on the road to recovery.

My point is fuck what your dad says, depression isn't embarrassing and you're not embarrassing! You're fighting a battle everyday and the fact that you survived your suicide attempt is a sign that it isn't your time to go and you have plenty to live for. Fuck what other people say, life is too short for other peoples negative opinions.
