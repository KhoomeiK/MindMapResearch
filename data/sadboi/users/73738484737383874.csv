Further notice. I was about to get a new job and that is on lockdown too. I’m limited to the types of jobs and hours due to my recovery however right now I basically can’t do anything so I’m stuck at home.

I’ve also been quite emotional lately because I’m super broke and relying on income assistance. I can’t get ei right now(I’m Canadian) because I maxed it out last year. Also, I’ve recently gone through a terrible separation and my heart is just in shambles.

So I’m stuck here at home, making pasta and isolating myself in my bedroom trying to not cry another minute. It’s been easier said than done. I’m alone but in yet I don’t wanna talk to anyone. Everyone is annoying and I feel an empty hole in my heart. I guess I’ll never find the love I deserve in this life.

Downvote me, disagree with me all you want I know you naysayers out there will disagree but I will say this loud and clear. I will absolutely NOT have sex, be in a relationship or to tell marry someone I don’t have feelings for. No connection, no commitment whatsoever. I’ve been raped numerous times, if i don’t feel a connection to someone it isn’t happening. Unfortunately, the only people I feel connected to don’t want me back. And vice versa. It’s never mutual. 

I’m a 27 year old woman and the chances of me ever having sex again are below 0% yet I crave that closeness that intimacy that “mutual love” so bad I’m probably going to drink myself to death. He’ll, my liver is in the early stages of already failing. I don’t know why I have to be with someone I don’t fucking want.

So I understand your situation entirely. I’m only interested if there’s a serious connection. Any fuck boy energy is an instant turn off. Pretty much anyone invoking sex is a fucking turn off. 

I get you. I really do.

There was a quote somewhere that said, “never sleep with someone you wouldn’t want to be.” I feel this. I feel you may resonate with this too, if you don’t that’s okay, I just thought I’d share.

And there isn’t a damn thing fucking wrong with it.

I haven’t had normal sex in 10 years after the rapes and my ex also raping me. Self pleasure yes, otherwise, nope. It’s just gunna lead to more heart tears we don’t deserve.."

Alls I wanna do is lay in bed sometimes. Sometimes for days. I’m a RAGING alcoholic. I’ve probably dranken over 100 bottles in the past few months. No fucks given. I’ll go get another one. I got out of the bathtub hours ago and still sitting here, naked with my fat gunt out right now. My rooms a complete disaster I look like a hoarder with no hope. I have no desire to clean anything I’m just sitting her drink in my hand. I’ve been eating terrible lately and not giving a fuck, trying to use my recent “heartbreak” as an excuse but in reality I’ve been doing this shit for years. 

My mother hates me and probably wants me dead yet I live with her. I don’t even know what’s going on with my body all’s I do is drink alcohol. Trying to go to rehab but keep forgetting to call but I’m also in rehab for bulimia. At least I go to that but I still “engage” in that too. 

Trying to get a job right now for part time a couple days a week but I’m thankful to at least be on disability temporarily for my mentally FUCKED up state of health.

I’ve been raped 13 times and I have severe ptsd and sometimes that’s all I think about. I can’t be intimate with anyone yet I’m so deprived and often wanna fuck myself for some sort of relief. Maybe in my next life I’ll be worthy of a true and totally mutual lover. Not this one. 

I feel completely worthless and don’t really care if I pass. I don’t think my family gives a shit either. 

Sorry if this is too fucked up. That’s just a little tip of feeling the iceberg.

Stay strong, you aren’t alone.
