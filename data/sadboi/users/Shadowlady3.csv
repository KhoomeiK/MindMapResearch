_Man insulting and calling women parasite_

Looks like some need to insult to ask to have their right heard.

If you look at the graphics they are actually about both individuals working outside and women always working more hours than the males. Also the fact that one earns or not more money doesnt give him the benefit to not cleans his own house if both are working the same hours.

Many women earn more than their male partners, sorry to burst your bubble. More household work means work for free, so it means something. Its not recognise work that women do more than men. Again, just because is not important for _you_ doesnt make it less important for the ones that get affected by it. You only care about what benefits _you_.

>Again, very minimal and irrelevant effects. Women claim everything is harassment

Firstly, starts with depresion. 

Men normally try to cover up any show of weakness in them cause that's what they have learned to do all their life. Instead of asking for help. 

Thats the big difference between male and females in this matter: women are allowed to talk about their feelings with friends, parents etc. And they will reach for profesional help before a man. And that's what can save a life.

If that woman was in a relationship with a man and she finds out he was just there for sex, she will be hurt psicologycally.

That will be psicologically traumatic for that woman and will make harder for her to trust any other man.

Thats what using somebosy for sex is. The way you put it sounds like if all women woudnt care if a man will like to them to their faces. Also  that woman will treat him nicely, cook for him, buy him gift, invest in him, while he wont do the same for her.  That translates too money, effort and time imvested in that man.

You can say that moral is an instinct, but its also a learned instinct. Is taught to us by our family, and the colective we live in, and its also biological, because humans have empathy.   


When we are kids, we are learning what the world is and how it works. We are totally defensless and clueless criatures, and our caretakers are our parents. (whole family if you wish) So they have total power over us, in other words, our **parents are like god to us**. (same way theist call ""father"" or ""mother"" to their god"")   
If any of us look at what we thougth of our parents back then , we tend to think that they were very powefull people. That they managed our lives the way they wanted and  solved any problem for us. We wanted to be like them.  But of course, this was just our naive and young mind. Cause the moment you grow up, you realize how adults dont have everything figured out, they struggle, they make mistakes etc.

But their morals remain with us. So basically parents are a \_practical\_ god. And I say practical because, if you do something wrong, a believer will threaten you with ""god will punish you for this!!"" but, most of the times, that never happens. But we know very well that our parents will   
 punish us if we did something wrong. Hence, a direct consecuence of our action. Therefore these episodes created our sets of believes, that our actions have effects and consecuences.; the internal map of how we should behave in society to dont hurt others and don´t let others hurt us.

As you can see, no need for god to have morals. What a god will do is assure the kids that something bad will happen if she/he missbehave, that helps the parents to make the kid believe that even if the parents can´t see what she/he is doing wrong, god will. Exactly the same reason why parents use Santa Claus to blackmail the kids into being good.

So morals will be a set of believes from a certain person

  
> When nobody's watching, acting out of social obligation is irrational, so I think that all that's left is instinct and whatever moral systems you've based on that instinct. 

You seem to forget that there are people that are naturally good. That it doesn´t matter if nobody is watching, they will still choose to do good. Take a look at how some people behave during wars, where there is no order. Some might try to kill people, while others might try to protect them. It all boils down to our morals and our concience. Because if you do something wrong, some people won´t be able to live with it, while others will.  


Sex is a natural instict. But we are not irational beings. So we can control it.  If atheist were irrational an amorals, countries like Sweden were majority of them call themselves atheist, will be in the news all day for every single crime in the book. On the other hand, they happen to be one of the most developed countries with a good quality of live.   
Therefore we can control our instints when we know we shoudn´t let them run free. You might want to practice in the middle of the street cause its an ""instint"" but your morals and common sense tell you you shoudn´t.  


> You can act morally without instinct being involved. You can, just like you can have sex without wanting to. But why?    


Do u mean the way psycophats act morally sometimes, pretending they feel sympathy for others, even though they don´t have that ability?  


> Treating people the way you would want to be treated does not make them treat you that way, and sometimes you are given moral questions alone.   


No, it doesnt. That´s why people tend to be nicer with friends and family that have treated them fairly beforehand, than with strangers. But also that´s what life is about. You live your life trying to not hurt others, cause, what are you gaining by hurting others? If I know I have hurt somebody I get really worry . My concience will tell me I did something wrong and somebody is suffering because of it. And Im not answering to any big entity that will punish me. It´s just all me, my concience, my actions weren´t tunned with my morals and Im suffering the consecuences. Most of the times our minds will do the work for us.   


On the other hand, politicians might decide to cut down founding to a group of people in need, and they will do it without exitation. Where are their morals? well, in their own interest.

> To really condense my question down: Let's say you see somebody drop a $50 bill. Nobody else saw, and the person that dropped it doesn't/won't know. Why should you tell them, instead of pocketing it? \[You shouldn't\]   


If I pocket it, I might be 50e richer, but my concience will tell me I stole that money (is not like I found it in the street and I didnt see the owner) can I shut down my concience? will I feel bad about it? that depends on your morals.

1: Do i really need this? 

Video games, another dress.. The answer is no, unless you have enough money to repair the car, get the bus etc.

2: Do I have something similar already at home? If the answer is yes, don't buy it.

Like the expresion

 ""dejar de pensarte"" 
Is not normal in spanish, i doubt is correct. I think it comes from ""dejar de quererte"" That one is correct. But for spaniards it sounds more poetic (therefore is nice in a song) than the gramatically correct overly heard:

"" Voy a dejar de pensar en ti""

There is something missing when you say it. 
That ""Que"" its answering the question ""**Que** ha dicho? Ha dicho **que** si.
In english you dont use "" He said that yes"" But in Spanish you have to use it when you are refering to what the person said with the verbs **hablar, contar**

Que ha dicho? Ha dicho **que** vendría después.
Que has dicho? Le he dicho que no quiero hablar.
Que te ha contado? **que** ya no vive aqui.

But with other verbs:

Que has comido? He comido pasta _que_ ha hecho mi padre (_that_ my father cooked)
Cuando vienen? Ellos vendrán mañana.

""Mi decir"" Is fully wrong. Its just translated word by word from ""my say""."
