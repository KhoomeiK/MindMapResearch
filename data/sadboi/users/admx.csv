photoshop,fqdykbf,t1_fqdxcqc,1589298815.0,"On InDesign, the files are linked, so you could also easily have there an image that you are editing with effects and whatnot on photoshop, and once you save it, you can directly see it on InDesign without a hazzle of replacing the olf picture with the new one."
photoshop,fqdyb69,t1_fqdx1dc,1589298693.0,"You place the preview image as a smart object, and once it's aproved you just go inside the smart object and place there the bought image.

But I do agree with the other comments regarding using InDesign. But it all depends what kind of things you do. If it's mock-ups, go for Photoshop, but if it's layouts and those kind of things, rather go with InDesign."

I am doing home-office, and I work as a graphic designer, so I'm also mostly on my computer and when I'm done with it I just try to something else that be on my computer. Some people also asked me why I don't just work ""somewhere else"", but yeah, it's not really possible. 

This is a bizarre/confusing/strange situation indeed, and it will not last forever, you are totally right, this is a pandemic after all and what we mostly have to focus on at the moment is to stay safe and healthy.

I totally enjoy the content you create and always get happy when I see something new posted, but hey, keep it at your own pace, do what is right for you and makes you feel good :)
