AskReddit,f0lqffa,t3_d5bek2,1568726838.0,"Fear, honestly.

I had been suicidal for a long time; diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at age 13, which was relatively ignored by my family. Over my highschool years I came out as queer, was raped, nearly disowned by my parents, and nearly failed out of HS. I also attempted to take my life three times.

I somehow got accepted into college. I honestly never thought I would make it that far in life. I majored in STEM, and loved it. I found a queer community on campus that felt safe, and I started dating this girl. It didn't make the depression or the stress of being queer go away, though. I twice more across my first 2 years at uni.

That girl was abusive. Emotionally, verbally, mentally, and on the rare occasion physically. I was too afraid to leave, and this girl made me isolate myself. I was scared. I was scared being with/around her would kill me.

I did the dumbest thing ever, and likely the only thing that saved my life:
I asked my friends, what remained of them, to invite us to a public outing. I got piss drunk, drove to that outing, and broke up with her in public.
I stared down the barrel of a glock she pulled from her purse. (Daughter of a druglord and all that). To this day I havnt been more scared. Eventually she back down, and left.

I ran over to one of my friends, collapsed in her arms, and had her bring me home. I cried for hours. Eventually, I starting dating this girl, and she convinced me to go to therapy.

Between that friend (now fiancee), and the cold realization that I was afraid of dying, I got enough  of a shock to start trying to help myself.

From that day, it has been a struggle, but one well worth it. Therapy, meditation, self help all together. In the last 16 months I have had only one incident that I used emergency therapy to get through.

I still struggle; depression, anxiety, ptsd. But it works."

After I came out, I found my new best friend. He was supposed to go that night, but didnt because he got an extra homework assignment.

After I came out, I found the love of my life, who's  friends thought her name was going to be on that list because she went to the ER the same night (unrelated). She tells me stories of sobbing in the hospital bed, trying to read the names.

After I came out, I 'adopted' a sister who's family wasn't the best to her. And I held her crying on the first anniversarry, the anniversary that she lost her best friend.

After I came out, on the second anniversarry, I took my friends, my family, to the memorial. I was the only one not directly connected, the only one who could keep the tissues coming for everyone else. On that night, they read the names. On that night, two years later, I heard the name of a boy I crushed on in the 7th grade. I never knew he was GRSM. I never knew he was in orlando. But I knew him.

The devastation I have seen from that day is unbelievably total: I do not know a person in my community who does not light a candle each year, myself included.

But also, the love I have seen in the days that followed, and every year after, is so pure, and so massive, and so insurmountable that I can't help but feel pride. Feel belonging to a community of people that are... wonderful.

Example:
