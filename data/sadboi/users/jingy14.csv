BiffyClyro,fqmr9wg,t3_gjsagq,1589482204.0,This song instantly lifted my mood. Lovely stuff.
BPD,fjvo4g0,t3_fcrfpo,1583629188.0,It’s honestly gotten to the point now when I’m never sure whether I’ve been wronged or not. I don’t trust my instincts. I just assume I’m in the wrong most times.
BPD,fg7ueus,t3_exetwi,1580601712.0,"I think you need to establish boundaries, but make sure that she knows you’re still there for her. 

My girlfriend did this for me. She began by reassuring me of my importance to her and of her love for me. Then she explained that she was feeling overwhelmed by my sole reliance on her and that she felt it would be better for the both of us if I found ways of spreading the load. She suggested other friends, therapist, family members, and generally helped me build that wider support circle. 

I rely on her a lot less now, particularly when it comes to relationship insecurities (which are usually based on paranoia rather than the facts)."

BPD,f9anbzu,t1_f8wuov8,1575204422.0,"I wasn’t abused either. My parents are the best. But I was bullied constantly throughout my school career, from 5-18. That’s my trauma."
niceguys,f7iac6w,t1_f7ia4bk,1573755924.0,"That part about trusting yourself is one of the hardest things. Like, if I’m angry at someone, is that anger reasonable or is it just my head fucking with me?"
niceguys,f7i8ua3,t1_f7i8jpu,1573754981.0,Absolutely. It’s an immensely complex disorder. My experience of it is constantly evolving.
niceguys,f7hwym3,t1_f7hkpcg,1573749000.0,"Yeah, this is awfully similar to the sensation of “splitting” people with Borderline Personality Disorder experience. You can go from totally idealising someone to utterly devaluing them in a minute. 

I definitely don’t think this applies to all “nice guys”, but it’s 100% a thing."
