StonerProTips,fo3z3ct,t3_g5bggc,1587495403.0,"Few things i sometimes do. 

I will prepare some snacks before i have smoke ( that way my hungry stoned ass wont go rummaging thru the pantry and just eat everything)
Fruits are soo good when ur high -add honey for extra sweetness

As well, things that take a while to eat. 
Like popcorn - Grab one piece and eat at a time.
With lollies instead of chewing it, suck on it."

My dad instantly left his work (which was like and hour away) drove to the hospital and started asking for his son who had apparently broken his leg. He didn't find him.

Still till now learning how my brain works. And wow, its all making sense why i was so different to my peers and friends and basically eveyone around me. 

I was always very clever and found ways that worked for me and was ALWAYS studying so one ever suspected anything. But over time the stress and anxiety ate me from the inside out until i became a literall walking stress head about to explode. 
At least until my doctor suggested i see a psychologist.

At University (electrical engineering) i was always slower at solving and understanding concepts and problems and had to physically write every step of the way to know what the fk i was doing. 

And omg yess. My navigation skills are crazy good. Like i can look at a map. See the geographical location of my destination and ill just drive on instinct. Then as soon as someone asks how do i get there, i cant answer ðŸ˜‚"
ADHD,f9iluyd,t3_e59zya,1575340285.0,"Im having the same issue and still trying different things.
Try and eat as soon as u take your medication before it starts to kicks in.
And make Sure you're eating something good and nutritional so in case u forget later in the day u would have at least had a good breakfast.
Ive heard of people putting alarms throughout the day and keeping things like museli or protien bars in your bag for a quick snack

Also very important to drink lots of water as these meda can really dehydrate you.  So carry around a water bottle at all times"
Anxiety,f9iib13,t3_e590v1,1575337828.0,"Good job on wanting to take that next step. It can be really hard to come to terms wirh. 
Ask your Doctor and they can usually advise you on what steps to take. 
But i guess if u want a straight answer u gotta know the differences between the 3. 

Therapist is kinda the broader term for anyone that provides support for people. 

A psychologist specialises more in human behaviour and can help people with their mental state. they can also diagnose. 

A psychiatrist is like a more advanced psychologist who can prescribe medication."

Pink had her own reasons for doing what she did. Yes she was very irresponsible with her actions but she diddnt have intentions to hurt anybody, especially spinel. 
Spinel has her own underlying issues and pink shouldn't be to blame for  this. Its unfair that spinel was waiting for 6000 years. But she diddnt have to wait, she could have continued her life. But cause of her dependency and dedication to pink. she drove herself to insanity"
