AskHistorians,fq80edp,t1_fq7zf1l,1589155946.0,"In the Neolithic, both children *and adolescents'* remains appear to be limited in the burial record, according to Cooney and Grogan. So at least in this period, exclusion from formal burial doesn't seem to be limited to very young children but to all non-adults. (There are a few exceptions, such as a child buried with grave goods at Lough Gur, who is believed to have had some ""ascribed rank"" from their parents.) This exclusion of children from formal burial continues into the Bronze Age, where children are still underrepresented (with a notable exception this time being the BA cemetery at Fourknocks I which has a high proportion of child burials). Really, the fact that the exclusion of children from formal burial extended for such a long period of time is interesting in and of itself, because Irish society grew far more hierarchical in the Bronze Age so one might expect a lot more burials of children with elite parents like you saw at Lough Gur. My research focused on the Mesolithic through the Bronze Age-Iron Age transition, so I can't speak to the Iron Age, but if you're interested in the treatment of children's remains in Irish prehistory I highly recommend Naimh Ní Riain's thesis that I cited in my initial comment.

AskHistorians,fpkfm1b,t3_fjcgeb,1588693801.0,"Just a tidbit I've been saving up for this Floating Feature:

Something that I've found interesting in my past year's thesis research is the status of children in Neolithic and Bronze Age Ireland. Essentially, it appears from the burial record that they were not perceived in either era as ""full members"" of their communities. Despite what would have been both a high population of children and a high child mortality rate, children were rarely given formal burial (with a few notable exceptions later on of children who appear to have been higher-ranked socially speaking, likely due to their parentage) and those who were formally buried were often buried with adults (family members, perhaps?). And finally, the burial rite of cremation was pretty much solely reserved for adults, while children were inhumed (buried unburnt). It seems that most of the time, when a child died they weren't buried with the full level of ritual reserved for adults. We can speculate endlessly about why this might be, but in the end it's impossible to say for sure what was different about society's perception of children in those prehistoric times without a time machine.
