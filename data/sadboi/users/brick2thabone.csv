awakened,fjgdkk3,t3_fd39e2,1583323098.0,"What is the “you/I” that feels this way? Does it exist? Since the “you” you thought you were does not exist (personality is nothing but concepts, conditioning and memories) then all there is is pure awareness. Surrender to the pure awareness and it will come into the foreground more and more."
streamentry,fgumppj,t3_f07l3a,1581124607.0,Read Carl Jung’s ‘The Red Book’. He wrote it during the years when he was borderline psychotic and had one foot in madness and the other in reality. It’s very enlightening especially how it details him integrating the unconscious (shadow) with his conscious self. It’s a process of bringing both sides  together. This also parallels awakening which is basically the same process (Jung calls this Individuation) just described in eastern terms. Your friend is likely traversing the ‘dark night of the soul’ period. Reading Jung and other spiritual texts may help understand the stage he is at and consequently help in traversing this period and integrating it.

Soulnexus,f1rmrkk,t3_dagcut,1569717525.0,"Yep, absolutely. Period. I was diagnosed as bipolar II when I was 21, did not continue medication and have been fine since, I am now 36, married with a son. And successful in the eyes of our societal standard (east coast us). Thing is, I continually look back on my ‘experience’ that led up to my diagnoses. I had experience most would consider mystical which would seem crazy by a bystander. As time went on, the insights gleaned from that period have been refined (through contemplation) and now seem to have been distilled a bit more to expose their raw truth. Over the past 2 years I have resumed the path of the seeker and am more content than ever before. My experience was when I was 22 was only a glimpse of what is possible, I truly believe that as long as I persist with seeking, then true awaking will commence (and stick)."
