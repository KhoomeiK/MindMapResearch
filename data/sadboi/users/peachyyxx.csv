unpopularopinion,eytibnj,t1_eyti8mm,1567437330.0,"1st of all i never said i hated anybody so take a couple steps back and reflect on that. 
2nd of all, who even said i had mental illness? Like dude get a grip. 
If you wanna smoke no ones stopping you. Get a life üòÇ"
unpopularopinion,eyti70h,t1_eyti4gw,1567437234.0,Uhm ok?
unpopularopinion,eythpbj,t1_eythc7b,1567436864.0,Okay. Did you ever try to stop before that or the first time was at 24? Also did you ever feel like you were messing with your health or was it never much of a thought?
unpopularopinion,eythfhj,t1_eytham0,1567436661.0,Yes. Isn‚Äôt this a safe place to share unpopular opinions or am I just mistaken?

That‚Äôs the only thing that keeps me from texting my ex."
relationship_advice,er66q0u,t1_er65ko5,1560541107.0,Thank you (:
inlaws,er66lbd,t1_er5y51e,1560541032.0,"Thank you. Its just hard realizing he wouldn‚Äôt jump through half the hoops and loops i would for him. 
I told him real family love is acceptance in the end and he didnt believe that was a possibility."
inlaws,er546e1,t1_er53ziy,1560517602.0,"Yea. We thought about it, and we both still go to school and it‚Äôd be difficult (not impossible) living alone. But that‚Äôs not even the issue; he doesn‚Äôt want to go NC with his family"
relationship_advice,er536ks,t1_er4yvet,1560516888.0,"I do agree with you. I realized that yesterday, maybe I don‚Äôt mean enough to him to be fought for and i told him he‚Äôs worse than his parents for perpetuating the behaviour and agreeing."
relationship_advice,er4lnu5,t1_er4lle6,1560497404.0,He has stood up to his family and they threatened to disown him.
relationship_advice,er4llmj,t1_er4larf,1560497319.0,"Yea, but that‚Äôs also easier said than done."
relationship_advice,er4l1jf,t1_er4kvd2,1560496547.0,"I guess. I simply thought it wasn‚Äôt going to be an issue anymore, if he knew he was happy and wanted to keep choosing happiness at the end of the day. 

His family doesn‚Äôt affect me, per say. I don‚Äôt really care for their opinion. He‚Äôs the one that cares. He gets threatened to be disowned, and he gets called names for wanting to be with me and pushing for them to accept us. He just doesn‚Äôt see the light at the end of the tunnel. He doesn‚Äôt think they will ever leave it alone, and that the only way for us to have a future is to completely leave his family behind. And he‚Äôs not ready to do that."
relationship_advice,er4knjd,t1_er4jeef,1560496033.0,"I‚Äôve known about them not really liking me for him for a while, and I never really cared because in my opinion a relationship is between two people. And although i would‚Äôve loved the idea of our two families coming together, i knew it wasnt going to be a reality‚Äîat least for a while, and I was very okay with it. 
He has broken up before because of it, but he realized his happiness was priority, and decided he wanted to put that forward. We had such a good time after that breakup, it was like falling in love all over again...
But here we go again."
relationship_advice,er4kih8,t1_er4jd74,1560495845.0,"I told him that he needs to do whats right etc. His response was that at the end of the day he doesnt want to leave his family behind and he wants his familys support. And it would hurt him that they wouldn‚Äôt be there at our wedding or be there for our prospective children. 
I don‚Äôt know.. deep down, i know that where there‚Äôs will there‚Äôs a way, and he should stand for what‚Äôs right, but i feel like i‚Äôm wrong to want him to choose me over his family. 
I don‚Äôt want him to get disowned because of me, but I also think if he cared enough and loved us enough, he wouldn‚Äôt care...but then again i feel selfish for thinking that. See the trend?"
BreakUps,eqnj3r5,t1_eqnh4ls,1560176575.0,"He said it after, like as a heads up: ‚ÄúBy the way id we get back together, this will be our lifestyle‚Äù."
BreakUps,eqn8qto,t1_eqn8ity,1560173114.0,Ain‚Äôt that the truth.
BreakUps,eqn8ozu,t1_eqn7kj4,1560173097.0,"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what he wants. He knows I would never. 
I think it‚Äôs more of an ego thing. I always used to be his backbone and basically the only ear that he had without any judgment and I sympathized with his issues. (He has a bunch). I think that‚Äôs more his angle. Still have the luxury if me hearing him out and helping and being a shoulder to lean on, without the commitment of a relationship. 
I told him to come back in a few months if thats what he wants because I am not ready to be just friends with him yet. 
Besides...I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a front..but he never was religious or believed in God, but now he swears he wants to practice abstinence until marriage..(in my opinion he is pushing me away) because he said that‚Äôs the only way we‚Äôd get back. 
I refused..I don‚Äôt necessarily believe in it, plus I feel forced into it. Id rather it be my choice..Was I wrong for that?"
BreakUps,eptkzcp,t1_eptko4s,1559492375.0,I feel for you. I really do hope you‚Äôre going to get over them soon enough.
BreakUps,epti7kw,t1_eptdypg,1559490734.0,Jealousy? Have they started seeing other people already?

BreakUps,epsqhrl,t1_eps8erg,1559460573.0,I am so sorry. You must feel awful?
BreakUps,eprp3b0,t1_ep562jh,1559428583.0,"Yea mine said he wanted out so he could work on his anger and family issues. Like dude i was there for him through all the crap, I was his shoulder to cry on when he felt like the world was against him and I gave him my undying attention and love to try and make him see that life is so much more than what he thinks it to be. For over a year and a half I held him up and helped him and made sure he knew i was his support system and would forever be loyal and ride for and with him through hellfire and back.....Then he drops the bomb on me ‚Äúi dont want to be in a relationship at the moment, i want to get better‚Äù Talk about feeling like I was used!"
