AskAstrologers,fq6pv1l,t1_fq6faz3,1589136158.0,"Ya Mars in Virgo does make you witty. It also gives you good habits, likely you’re in good physical shape. I’m super accident prone yet have never broken a bone, and I’m not even an athlete or anything. I definitely empathize on not having the most solid ideas ever, it can feel like you’re more wishy washy than you really are. That just means when you make a statement, it’ll be a bold one people notice because nobody expected it.

Pisces Saturn helps with spirituality. I have it too and the journey to discovering your spirituality was likely difficult but considering pisces is the most spiritual sign, when you find it, it will be much more rewarding than it is to other people. You will have gifts as a healer (especially with your Mars sign as well) and amazing insight lots of people lack, so you can tap into that power"

I’m guessing you might experience bullying in the form of verbal bullying?

Just trying to picture that because this is a super new connection and we’re not together but there is a strong pining from both ends. I could see intuitively how codependency would happen, but we have a tight venus trine chiron in our synastry, so it’s supposed to help healing of wounds once the barriers are broken down a little. I have my natal chart posted somewhere in my profile, and I have lots of squares, so it doesn’t surprise me that there would be a lot in any compatibility charts. I’m not scared of a challenge, but it needs to be something that won’t leave both parties more broken down then they were before ultimately so that’s my main concern here.

I like humility as well  but am more open about how they express themselves. I would look at all your personal inner planets, especially Venus, I think the combination of those shows what you’re attracted to in romance and sex."

AskAstrologers,fibfqr0,t1_fi9dz2x,1582321004.0,Ya it was intense energy which isn’t so much what I found off putting as it was his unpredictable behavior. Makes it even harder to trust. And I need a dependable lover.
AskAstrologers,fibfiqq,t1_fialj0w,1582320874.0,Honest mistake lol.
AskAstrologers,fiaj630,t1_fi9ppzo,1582302133.0,It’s in 10th actually
AskAstrologers,fi94064,t1_fi930fw,1582255031.0,"Oh really? Is he committed to you now? I just find him kind of weird more than anything. He says things like we are soulmates or other type things but still doesn’t have my phone number, and gets really awkward around me unless he is drunk, in which case he just acts sexual and off putting. 

I would think he was a player if it wasn’t for the fact that he hasn’t been “intimate” with anyone for a long time and behaves so awkwardly. And seems to have special feelings toward me in particular for whatever reason"
AskAstrologers,fi8uem1,t1_fi8kgp4,1582248585.0,Oh wow you’re really good! Thanks for the advice
AskAstrologers,fi89guu,t3_f7019f,1582235938.0,It means that you might find it harder to balance things in your everyday life. Do you find it harder to take initiative on things or find passion in something?
AskAstrologers,fi898ep,t3_f7071c,1582235811.0,"Blue is trines and sextiles, meaning energy flows easily between the two. Red is squares and oppositions, meaning there is tension or conflict involved. However hard aspects aren’t necessarily always bad, they sometimes give us a healthy amount of challenge that gives us the drive to be better at something and builds character. Easy aspects can sometimes lead to complacency or laziness. So that’s what’s important to remember, a balance of the two often lends the way to success"
AskAstrologers,fi7vl3v,t1_fi77wrj,1582228962.0,"Ya I’ve noticed that. How did you know haha.

He’s more socially awkward around me than normal and never looks me in the eye much, but there is this unspoken intuition if that makes sense. He says things like he thinks we’re soulmates. But then when drunk he acts like all he wants is sex. I can’t tell if he is in love or lust though. He’s kind of shown both, he gives very very mixed/confusing signals."
AskAstrologers,fi76cas,t1_fi75ifr,1582215203.0,"Oh ok, ya we have each pthers in the fifth house. I noticed my sun conjuncts their descendant, what does that signify? That’s the 7th house cusp right?"
