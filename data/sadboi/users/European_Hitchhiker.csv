As long as it's okay with the person where you register I don't see a problem registering in a youth hostel, with a friend or wherever. Then get the library card - once you have it, you have it. It's very unlikely to get cancelled. 

Just be aware that if you're registered here you might need health insurance here as well. If you just register for 28 days and then de-register I can't really imagine anyone would hassle you about anything though. If you stay registered longer, definitely look into some kind of health insurance. If the library sends you letters about late fees, and you don't receive it - then it might be possible they would cancel your account.

I've never heard of anyone getting hassled for the other things you ask about. You would get in trouble not having health insurance, dodging taxes or returning books late though. OF course if you permanently move to a new address - do remember to update your registration."

China_Flu,fkh7t2d,t3_fihji3,1584191487.0,"Great question!

Of course it's great to not overwhelm our hospitals, and 'too flatten the curve'. Not to many infections at a time.  But then what? In 10 weeks - if life starts again the epidemic is straight of increasing in size again, right?

Keeping restrictions while this thing slowly moves through the population would mean that yes, the hospitals don't get overwhelmed - but we would need to keep restrictions for a very long time. It would not be a great long-term solution. E.g. Italy has about 60 million people. Official numbers are around 18 thousand infected. Imagine how long it would take before 'herd immunity' kicks in! (Like some leaders seem to suggest.)

As a vaccine is by most predictions about 12 to 18 months away, we can't realistically wait for that. It would be economic disaster.

However, **it might be** that come spring/summer infections slow down, in that case restrictions can be loosened without problems. The problem likely would be shifted to countries going into autumn/winter (southern hemisphere), so not really a global solution. Still it would make things easier and countries with a lighter load can help others.

We can however also look at countries that seem to manage the outbreak quite well. E.g. Taiwan seems to be on top of things on an incredible level, without shutting all of public life down. If the virus keeps persistent we should look at them, and see to what degree we can copy their model. Of course they took this thing seriously straight from the start, giving daily television updates from the 1st infection (maybe even before). They've done airport screening and have taken many measures other western countries didn't.

It helps being an island of course, and a question might be too what degree other countries have more porous borders.  However for now most countries will see how this develops in the next weeks, and take things from there.

Ps. I'm so glad you asked, since I feel we talk way too little about this. Would love to have a discussion on this topic!"

Schools: occasional closure of some schools and kitas when someone is infected. The tune of the health ministry is: ""General school closure due to coronavirus is highly unlikely"".   


In the meantime Japan closed all schools at 200 infections, Czech at 40, Italy at 2500. Maybe some others as well. Germany at 1200 infections is apparently not even considering it... Although in the end it seems to be a decision of the individual bundeslander.

He has to be willing to change himself, and be a bit more open to communication. Why does going to the shop make him so furious? Is he already overworked, depressed, stuck in a unsatisfying job or is there something else going on that makes him already frustrated?

Ps. If he messes up the shopping, gets angry from the dishes, why not let him try to cook sometime? Maybe it's something he's actually great at. Nothing unfair about giving your spouse the space to cook sometimes. Having one spouse cook each and every day is a 50's mindset..."

AskReddit,fhxyv5g,t1_fhxso5p,1581965118.0,"After having sick time, the next hurdle is having a good health care system.   
Surprisingly the German health care system isn't always that great.  
I lived in various places in Germany, sure enough some doctors were very efficient and friendly; some however are flat out rude, incompetent and super inefficient.

For example; you might have the opportunity to enjoy infecting everyone in the waiting room while waiting 2,5 hours for the doctor to get you a simple sick note.  


Also had a doctor shout at me, because I only came to him on my 2nd sick day. Like dude, I literally couldn't get out of bed - I imagine a doctor of all people would understand what it's like being sick?!?  


Other doctors however where great - I used to have one where I never waited more then 10 minutes for my sick note, and also some doctors wouldn't mind if you get there only on your 2nd or 3th sick day..."
AskReddit,fhxxuxa,t1_fhxsjmd,1581964556.0,"The two days is not written in stone, here in Germany I've had the same employer going from always requiring a sick note to only from the 2nd day.

Also, I've been told (informally, because it's illegal) - 'It's very bad for you if you get sick in the first 6 months'. And sure enough, one colleague at that job immediately got fired when he got back from sick time after one month.  


Although it's true there's no limited sick time, you might find your contract doesn't get renewed in the first two years if you're sick to much. One time our company shared a spreadsheet internally which also happened to have everyone's sick time on it. It seemed on average people where off sick two weeks a year."

Off topic, maybe, but I just want to say this struck me as such a strong poetic image! Beautifully put!  


I appreciate your whole post, I find it incredibly clear, well-put and easy to relate. I'd say that you are concerned with the real problems. It's such a relief to hear such a clear perspective from someone growing up in Russia, it's not something I've encountered much. Of course I understand that for you it's not easy at all, and I feel a lot of sympathy for your struggle.   


I don't know if changing countries would help or not. Growing up in The Netherlands I also didn't feel like I was in the right place. Even if the problems are possibly much less strong then your country, I felt I was totally in the wrong environment. I felt quite intensely that I was looking for a meaningful life - and everything everyone around me expressed was simply put: ""Join the ratrace, run as fast as you can, make the most money you can - then retire"". Totally pointless to me. Everything that was modeled around me was just survival nothing else.  
In school it was like: great success early on, failure later. I just wasn't motivated at the end, always felt like a tree planted in the wrong environment, if I can borrow your analogy...  Maybe it's the curse and the blessing of INFP like types that we are looking to deep and can not life superficially in an unsatisfying world.

Maybe if you feel like it, you can just risk it - why not go live a year or so in western europe and see what it's like without that restrictive government. Maybe there's some study exchange program or something you could do? For me I know I always felt the most at home when I followed my heart and went on huge adventures outside the conformity of my immediate surroundings.  Either way, all the best to you!

I've got no idea how someone can think peanut butter & chocolate don't taste good together. Ever tried 100% pure peanut butter with bitter chocolate? It's heaven! If it's crappy peanut butter though, yes, I'll also pass..."
