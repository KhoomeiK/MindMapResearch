I smoke everyday. Flower when I’m home and vape when out. It’s just medicine to me. I’d rather rip a bong than swallow a pill everyday and my therapist is supportive so that makes me feel better about it. It helps me be a functioning contributing member of society lol I’m barely human when sober. I’m getting tired of the smoking though so I’m looking into making my own edibles now."
BPD,f67mg87,t3_dqlku1,1572720864.0,"Definitely possible! It depends on both people though. You need to want to be healthy and your partner needs to be understanding and supportive. Both people need to put in the work no matter how hard it is. I’ve been with my SO for 2.5 years or so. It’s been rough sometimes, but we love each other very much and we want to make it work. I’m not on meds, but I have a therapist I see every week. I smoke cannabis for my anxiety (therapist approved). My SO joins me for couples sessions sometimes too. It’s important not only for the pwBPD to have therapy, but for the partner as well imo. we have ups and downs, but we’re happy. I actually believe she’s never going to leave me. In fact, some of my coworkers often tell me they wish they had a relationship like mine. And they have “normal” relationships with their partners. 

Anyway, I hope that happens for you one day! Everyone deserves love and happiness."

I guess it depends on what other mediums he’s using the liners with? I use mine to line watercolors and prismacolor colored pencil pieces. 

I’ve mainly used Microns and Fabre-Castells. I like Microns a lot, but Faber-Castells are my fave so far. When used with watercolors the ink doesn’t run or smudge. 

Surprising him with a new set is a wonderful idea!! 😻 I get very very happy when Master gets me art supplies! Art stores are one of my favorite places to be lol 😊"
