AnxietyDepression,flah6fu,t3_fnnktn,1584983793.0,"Kindly contact a depression helpline.. Giving up is not an option. Life is worth living. No matter how troublesome. Inspite of a history of self-harm and 3 attempts, even though I'm a little dead on the inside. I'm alive and kicking. I hope you find something in life worth living. If not for others, at least for yourself. Please don't give up. Take this opportunity to work on yourself and build yourself to be an inspiration for survival. Please."
AnxietyDepression,fkbtq3s,t3_fhlen8,1584039691.0,"Hey there, I think your symptoms are mostly stress related. How about getting good sleep or taking short naps occasionally in the day if possible. Try some relaxation techniques like music and deep breathing exercises. If it still doesn't subside, then get a doctor's appointment."

Neuropsychology,fk3udjt,t3_fg9gs6,1583846501.0,I'm not a professional with respect to mental health inspite of being a chronically depressed and socially anxious person (24/M). I suggest that you should seek professional help.. Book an appointment and go with your SO. This will help you as there will be a team approach rather than you struggling on your own.
introvert,fk3mrn0,t3_fg9ymx,1583840014.0,"When I eat alone in public places, I tend to get very conscious about how I eat. Especially bcoz of my social Anxiety. But if I can distract myself while watching something on my phone while eating, it works wonderfully as I feel much more comfortable."

Anxietyhelp,fk3m88t,t3_fg8233,1583839463.0,Find something better to do.. Like change your lifestyle a little.. Make new friends.. Learn a new skill or hobby.. See if it helps.
socialanxiety,fi6t7c3,t3_f6objt,1582206775.0,So wish this could be true.. It would greatly reduce the anticipation of triggering a panic attack
sad,fh7hw2p,t3_f1k29w,1581332673.0,I agree.. Especially when u r dying on the inside and our fellow human beings aren't raised to be sensitive to people struggling with mental health issues.

AnxietyDepression,fb1gxgp,t1_f72uoq8,1576436776.0,"Allright, so maybe a friend can help.. There are therapists u can book online. See if that might offer you some support. It's ok to fail exams.. No biggie.. Your mental health is more important. Take your time to get back to your normal routine. Then when u feel better, try reaching out to someone again. Let me know how it works out. Don't lose hope. Take care."
AnxietyDepression,f8dlwkj,t3_e0e4uk,1574497499.0,"Great to hear, it took me 5mo to clean up my room.. 3mo into  CBT.. Keep it up!"
confidence,f8dj5t2,t3_e0ed76,1574493305.0,"Not at all.. I have been struggling with Social Anxiety Disorder for the past 23 years, even saying 'Hi' or 'thanks' takes me couple of tries with increasing my voice modulation and sounding clear enough to be heard. I'm a Postgraduate student btw.. So it's kinda embarrassing to even bring it up.. Hope u can find a way to get through your problem and  provide me with some way of working on mine. By the time I'm done with thinking of what to say or just smiling sheepishly, the person already moves along to converse with someone else.. So I'm left with lots of regrets and afterthoughts. I may have the same kind of problem like yours.. Hopefully someone more experienced can guide us through this so we both can find a way to get around this problem."
Anxiety,f7yuzlc,t3_dy6hb6,1574101114.0,"Good luck mate.. Be there for each other irrespective of circumstances.. Help each other to heal and grow stronger. Have a healthy, strong relationship. Cheers!"
AnxietyDepression,f7mxx0z,t3_dx1r9h,1573877184.0,Try to get her to a therapist/counselor as soon as possible so that this doesn't affect your daughter's mental health in the long run. Be strong for both of them and don't lose hope. Try reaching out to family members who may be able to provide support.

mentalhealth,f71t3xq,t3_dtv7se,1573347562.0,"This person is not right for you. If you feel that you need help, go get help. Anyone who thinks otherwise and can't be their to support you, needs to be kept distance from and do so till you get better. Think about your mental health, peace of mind and healing. Get better rather than being stuck in an emotional turmoil with this person. Get all the help and support you need. Take care."
AnxietyDepression,f71siqf,t3_dtx8qj,1573347167.0,"I used to feel like that a lot, until I opened up to a close friend about it..who eventually gave me the courage to reach out to a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and lack of motivation. It takes a lot out of you and initiative seems like an overwhelming effort. But try to reach out to someone.. Maybe a family member, a close friend or even your teacher. You may feel that, but if they don't go through it, how will they know how to help you, but just give it a try and see how it works. Maybe even try keeping a journal for thoughts and emotions. Keep a daily priority/ to-do list. Take all the time you need, but make sure you clear the toughest of them first, take a break, relax a couple of hours, then carry on with the rest of your tasks. See how this works out and let me know. I'm here for you. I have been through similar experiences, failed a year and repeated all the exams for that year as an undergraduate. I will guide you further if u need me to. Just take whatever you have and put it into effort to reach out. All the best. Take care. Keep in touch.. I'm here if you need me."
Anxiety,f6m2e3p,t3_dry3el,1572965544.0,Best of luck.. You  will do great üëç
AnxietyDepression,f6gzy9l,t3_dra1z9,1572833888.0,"It's really great to hear that you want to reach out and help someone going through a personal struggle in life.. Ask him to continue therapy, Journaling his emotions both positive and negative to keep track of his emotions; learning a new hobby to distract and steer him off the path of self destruction (be it self harm or negative self image and thoughts) speaking to close Fam and friends about what makes him uncomfy and how to find a way around it, music, workout and healthy habits to keep him positive. Ask him to watch motivational videos of 'Nick Vujicic'. All this has helped me get better from my struggles with 24 y/o Social Anxiety and 19 y/o Depression. Hope it helps him too. Take care and good luck with helping him out. If you or him need any additional support, kindly contact me on +447787075906."
mentalhealth,f6euz60,t3_dr39yu,1572808035.0,"Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your struggles. Try journaling your emotions and thoughts, to keep track of your positive and negative thoughts and feelings. Make a to do list of daily priorities and strike off the ones that you have accomplished. Speak to maybe someone who can help.. Like a therapist or a family member /friend who you can trust. Formulate a path to achieve your goals and keep at least 2-4 hours for yourself so you can rejuvenate, be it swimming, workout, meditation or music.. Whatever makes you feel better. Try this out.. It worked well for me. 19 y/o depression and social anxiety, I'm much better off now.. I'm a post grad working with assignments and deadlines for submissions with these 2 personal struggles.. It helped me.. So I suggest you try them.. Hopefully it'll help you too. All the best üëç"
AnxietyDepression,f6e5q4y,t3_dqw0h2,1572800509.0,"If you can find peace of mind in doing what you like in your solitude, don't bother with what people tell you. They don't understand what you are going through. Appreciate what they say, just don't give a second thought, do what you feel is best for you."
Anxiety,f621srm,t3_dqbc63,1572651712.0,"I feel its either of 2 things, 1, your anxiety is acting up, 2, that person has something going on in their life that has brought about some changes in their way of responding to texts. My opinion is that the best way to avoid jumping to conclusions is to keep communication lines open.. Be it personally (as in face-to-face) or on text. So the person can trust you enough to share their feelings and opinions. Thus, you don't have to feel anxious or worried about it. Try this out.. Let me know if it works for you. It did for me. Take care."
mentalhealth,f6083y6,t3_dpqmvh,1572609257.0,"Congrats!! Really proud of you üòÑ Keep it up and keep going strong. You may not realize it, but you are an inspiration for some of us. Thanks for sharing your progress."
AnxietyDepression,f562it8,t3_dmyewb,1572017562.0,"Hey bud, I'm sorry to hear that you are having a hard time.. I was struggling with depression for 2 years near the end of my Bachelor's degree.. I sought out therapy twice a week. After 10 months of cognitive behavioral therapy, I was much better. I could see that trying to learn a new hobby and making a journal to keep track of my emotions was a great way to deal with my depression, cope with the stress and break the repetitive patterns.. I suggest you try this.. See how it works out for you. Focus on your targets and keep yourself motivated. I wish you good luck for your recovery."
