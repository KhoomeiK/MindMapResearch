I sincerely hope meds will do the same for you."

My daughter turns 14 this year, she knows about my mental illness(es) and is aware now that she is the main reason I am still fighting this fight.

OCD,f2bsepe,t3_dct3h2,1570130427.0,"For me it is 3s and multiples there of. 

3 is perfect to me. It can be broken down into 3 one's. 9 is another perfect number, it can be split into 3 3s ...

I always ""look"" for 3s or patterns of 3s and I do most things in 3s. If I am faced with other numbers I will do ""math"" similar to you in my head until I get to a 3.

Finding or getting to 3s is comforting, it means that nothing bad will happen and that things have been done the ""right"" way."

CPTSD,f271v8p,t1_f26xpuy,1570028850.0,"Thank you for your answer and not judging me.

I have to say violent flashbacks are not a regular occurrence and I am mostly good with recognizing my triggers and stopping myself. 

The one in July happened right out of a nightmare, a seamless transition from sleeping into being awake and having a flashback. 

You are right, because I do not value myself (though I am working on this in therapy) I can ""deal"" with hurting myself but hurting my wife I find very hard to cope with (even though she has forgiven me and is very understanding)."

Intrusive thoughts that some male stranger might harm her.
Or my best friend, even though logically I know without a doubt he wouldn't, ever. Now that he has a child himself I have those thoughts about him harming his son too.

Everything has a specific order and has to be in it's place.
I pick the skin on my fingers, at its worst I basically flay them from the tip down to the second knuckle.
I have some food related compulsions but they are tied to an eating disorder so it's hard to tell what's OCD and what isn't."
