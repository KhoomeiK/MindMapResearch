I don't see any problem with it.  I take it for chronic back pain though.  I did use it in the beginning to get off oxy.  I was beginning to abuse it and I'd always run out early.  I got sick of it living like that and found a Suboxone doctor. 

I'll likely be on it for life. It's the only pain drug that I haven't had to increase the dose to get relief."
benzodiazepines,fk6d4rp,t3_fgjjno,1583899004.0,"Just be honest. My primary care doctor just switched me from klonopin to xanax.  My anxiety has become more panic / situational and I needed something that provides quick relief for unexpected situations.  It used to be a steady underlying anxiety that klonopin managed well.  Klonopin not so good for panic because of the slow onset.  In my case though, klonopin to xanax is a lateral move strength wise. 

Anyway, you'll need valid reasons to give him for why you want to switch. You're last 2 reasons seem valid.   You can say the ativan isn't working as well anymore. You might at least walk away with a stronger ativan script.  And depending on your doc, he might find Valium appropriate."

Duration of action on xanax is 4-6 hours i think.  Half life about 12 hours like you said.  It's not uncommon for people to take klonopin 3 times a day from what I've seen.

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist / antagonist and binds really strongly to your opiate receptors or some of them at least.  That being said fent could be strong enough to knock it off your receptors.  That was my understanding of how suboxone works.  I could be wrong

So i sought out a sub doctor to come off the oxy.  After switching to sub I realized it was handling my back pain just as well or better than the oxy so they never lowered my dose.


If you're referring to the testosterone, that's not for pain but for low T levels commonly associated with long term opiate use. I'm fortunate my pain management doc acknowledges that fact and is willing to prescribe the testosterone.  I self administer my shots.  1.5ml / 300mg every 2 weeks keeps my levels in the mid to upper range off acceptable levels."

suboxone,f6nwqro,t1_f6h5qi0,1573001954.0,Ask your doc about it.  It's pretty much the same As suboxone but it absorbs better under the tounge so the dose is a little lower. For instance 5.7mg of zubsolv = 8mg of suboxone.
suboxone,f6h5ask,t3_dr9nm0,1572837371.0,"Yes.  I take zubzolv 5.7mg twice a day.  Equivalent to 8mg suboxone 2x a day.

I was tired of doing that shit every month and resorting to tramadol or Kratom when my meds ran out early. I have a bad back.  Had surgery, a disc fused in 2008 and it's better but I still have chronic pain to deal with.  Started suboxone about 7 years ago and haven't looked back.  Haven't upped or lowered the dose.

suboxone,f5ptydh,t1_f5poezr,1572367709.0,"Yeah there's definitely a ceiling effect with bupe.  I think that dose will vary from person to person.  For me it's around 18-24mg.  The one time I've had surgery since starting subs I came it for about 5 days before the surgery. I took percocet for a week, about 60mg a day and it didn't help much. I think because I was used to such a high suboxone dose. Afterall, it's estimated to be about 30 times more potent than morphine mg for mg  When the percocet script ran out I waited about 36 hours then started back on my normal suboxone dose.  It was such a relief."

I got sick of it, so I voluntarily found a sub doctor. I started on suboxone 8mg 2x a day, and the doctors just never lowered my dose since it was working so well for my back pain. I'm now on zubsolv, so the dose is a little lower, but it supposedly equivalent.  So, IMO the analgesia is there, just without *most* of the warm and fuzzy high of oxy/hydro.

I'm actually on zubsolv now so the dose is 11.4mg a day because it has a higher bio-availability.  Or more of the drug is absorbed while in your mouth. Something like that.

I was at 200+ milligrams of Oxycontin a day for chronic pain and that's that I was started at, 8mg twice a day.  Been on that same dose for 7-8 years.  It's prescribed to me for chronic pain now.

I had back surgery and needed some of it for chronic pain before and after.  I just had low self control with traditional opiates.  I finally got tired of running out of my scripts early and got into an outpatient suboxone program. Saw the doc twice weekly for a while then went to once monthly after that.  I was on 8mg twice a day for 2 or 3 years, then my insurance changed.  I had to switch to zubsolv 5.7mg twice daily and I've been on that same dose since then. I've never ran out early.  I've never relapsed.  I've had one surgery where I had to come off of the sub for a week or so and take percocet for about a week.  It didn't do much to help.  The first dose of sub once I got back on it was such a relief. So for 7-8 years I've been on the same dose of buprenorphine & naloxone .  For the first year or so it was treating symptoms of opiate dependency, after that, my doctors began treating me as a chronic pain patient.  I'd be dead or in jail were it not for these medications. I've held down a full time job for 5 years now with the main side effect being low-T.  That's being treated with testosterone injections.

I started with doses of CBD around 20-25mg and went up from there.  In the end I had to take 150-200mg twice a day to get any relief.  It was better than nothing.  Sort of a subtle relaxation.  It has poor oral bioavailability.  Something like 6-10%.  I tried holding it in my mouth and under my tongue for a while, and this might have helped increase the effects a little.  In the end I was using the pure CBD crystals as it was the least expensive.  

As a side note, I think there were some 'studies' where they gave it to people before public speaking and it took doses of 600mg to have a noticeable effect.  I think these people who are taking small does like 25mg are just feeling placebo effect.  That's just my opinion."
Anxiety,f337ess,t3_dfi2tj,1570633203.0,The doses I had to take to get any relief were too expensive to maintain.

suboxone,f2ys5zb,t1_f2ycpr0,1570497156.0,"FYI those pacthes are in mcg (micrograms) per hour, not mg milligrams.  Thats how powerful buprenorphine is.  It might worth a shot.  Those are still very low doses and it might not have any of the side effects of higher doses like I'm on.  I take 5.7mg zubsolv twice daily.  Which is equivalent to 8mg twice daily of subutex or suboxone. But likw I said i was on 100-200mg of hydrocodone and or oxycodone a day when I switched.   It provides good pain relief for me. 

If it were me I'd ask for an extended release formulation of hydrocodone.  There are a couple on the market now.   There are lots of extended release opiates in pill form that you'd only have to take one or two a day.  Zohydro ER and Hyslinga ER.  Plus they contain no acetaminophen.   Seems like a better fit for you."
suboxone,f2yc8pm,t1_f2x6v2x,1570489008.0,I get my all my schedule III scripts filled every 28 days.  Shouldn't be an issue if you can get an appointment.  Unless things are different in your state.
suboxone,f2ybxer,t1_f2wqob4,1570488862.0,"The only major side effect I've had is low testosterone.  I had to go on hormone replacement therapy.    Buprenorphine is very long acting, so you'll probably only have to dose twice a day, maybe even once.  It definitely gives me a little pep in the mornings.  I function wonderfully.  I've held down a job for 5 years since being on it.  No issues whatsoever.  I initially went on it to get off of traditional pain killers like vicodin and oxycontin.  I was taking 100+ milligrams a day and always running out early.  

I ended up juat staying on suboxone because it was good for my pain and killed any urges i had for regular opiates.

If you're content with your meds and you're doc ia really concerned about your Tylenol intake, he could switch you to Norco with obly has 325mg of Tylenol per pill.  I cant say whether or not bupe is right for you or not.  You're on a pretty low dose of meds.  There may be better options.  Did he say which formulation of buprenorphine he wants to put you on? Suboxone, zubsolv, belbuca etc....  Juat curious how high of a dose he intends to start you on."
suboxone,f2wm0d8,t3_delzun,1570467377.0,Probably not too bad.  It has a \~36 hour half life.  You might start feeling a little yucky around hour 48.  Are you already out?  Was thinking you could split up what little you have left.
suboxone,f2wicfk,t3_delqt8,1570466143.0,"I use bupe for chronic pain, it's great for me.  It would need to be a pretty low dose given the amount of Vicodin you're taking.  You'll also have to stop taking the Vicodin for a couple of days before you start the bupe.  Definitely worth considering."

phenibut,f2ocf1d,t1_f2n5i1d,1570326042.0,I use adrafinil a couple of times a week and it's subtle energy.  Like you had the best nights sleep the night before.    It lasts about 12-14 hours and there's no nasty comedown IMO.  No jittery speedy feeling.  It's nice
suboxone,f2dq1g1,t1_f2dp9fd,1570161100.0,True.  I was just pushing back against the statement that one 8mg strip is equal to 10mg of morphine.  That seems way off
benzodiazepines,f2awdv0,t1_f2aixtz,1570118611.0,Not significantly. It really wasn't that big of a difference now that I think about it.
benzodiazepines,f2aj0rz,t1_f28x1jq,1570113938.0,Have you tried the C1s yet?  What did you think?  I sometimes think any difference I notice between generics is all in my head.
suboxone,f2aira4,t1_f29ckn9,1570113847.0,Yeah tell him you think you might have low-T and they can add that to the bloodwork.  No fasting required for that particular test.  Testosterone is naturally higher in the morning so get the bloodwork done in the afternoon so it shows up as low as possible.
benzodiazepines,f2ai6z8,t1_f2ahoeh,1570113642.0,I've taken 1200mg all at once and it seemed to work fine that way too.  Supposedly the bioavailablity is low that way though...
