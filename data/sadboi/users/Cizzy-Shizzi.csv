awakened,fgkrlap,t3_eyxwl8,1580872051.0,"You need to get him to a transpersonal psychologist, who will evaluate him like any other psych would but will also be aware of the spiritual nature of the situation at hand.

I went through a Kundalini awakening myself that spiralled into Kundalini psychosis when that energy was left unchecked (I didn't understand what it was at the time otherwise I could have made some attempts to ground myself). I ended up being involuntarily committed twice last year for it, for about 21 days each time, and let me tell you, being locked up and a my rights taken away like that was the absolute most horrendous thing that has ever happened to me, so think hard before you involve the police and get him taken away. 

Remember, a transpersonal psychologist is your best bey bet as they know both sides of the coin. 

Good luck!"

You need to eat more than you'd think to kick start your metabolism, rather than not eating at all. Think of your metabolism as a fire, and you should aim to feed it fuel to burn in steady, even doses to keep it constantly burning at a roar, rather than heaping it with a massive amount of fuel every so often, or starving it of fuel completely, both of which will cause the fire to suffocate and burn out. Aim for 3 small meals a day and 2 snacks. I lost a heap of weight years ago and I had to eat more food than I thought possible! Aim for 1200 calories a day, roughly 100 - 150 calories for each of your snacks. And just eat clean, with a piece of protein for every meal (to build the muscle that burns fat). Good luck!"
