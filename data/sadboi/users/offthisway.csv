depression lies to you. it makes you forget that the world is yours, if you want it, hell even if you dont you can do pretty good until you do.

small habit changes can help make things a little better. please keep going. please take small steps toward change. maybe you need big steps.i dont know. like for me i started being late all the time not even wanting to get out of bed and i made a small morning routine (what am i greatful for? listening to music and breathing excercises) or even legit jumping out of bed. 

but youre not dead yet. forget about comparing now to then. youre here and i belive in you. and maybe this page isnt good for you. who knows? but if you think youre going on a downward spiral, might as well change everything. whats the worst that can happen if youre already feeling like this?

NO ONE can because no one's perfect. there's no way to change the panic over this except accepting who you were and the fact that you cant change that.whenever you feel bad about this, look at the time. for me, it's 8:53 pm. i can only control, and therefore only worry about, what happens 8:53 and onward. forget about the past. the past sucks"

Basically, a guy has a terrible family life (his father had two wives and a whole different life so obviously thats traumatizing) and has always been independent. But, then he starts rejecting all of society's ideas like jobs and money. He goes into the wild for four months with absolutely nothing but a bag of rice, without talking to his parents in 3 years, and ends up dying. The idea is that he wanted to find himself and challenged himself to survive. Everyone in my class is like he's so selfish for pursuing his 'happiness' so irresponsibly without even trying to patch things up with his family, but all i see is a traumatized person who has always had to isolate themselves to survive and convinced himself he didnt need people, and they blame him and call him selfish. I tried to say that in our discussion but its like no one was getting it. LMAO i didnt actually read the book but from the analysis and summaries im pretty sure thays what happend? Maybe its just bc im depressed and im reading too much into it. All I know is it made me angry when they called him selfish."
