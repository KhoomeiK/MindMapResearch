EngagementRings,f4wk1x9,t1_f4wiwn2,1571856930.0,Yes I brought that up to him. He says that he wants a diamond. I was more open to other options because no one else really knows if you don’t tell them lol

Scorpio,f3yxfj8,t1_f3xj4mj,1571260623.0,Thank you. It wasn’t easy. I felt heartbroken from my friendship. But I knew I deserved better
Scorpio,f3xyvxo,t3_dintim,1571246056.0,"As scorpios we feel even more betrayed by what people do because we are really loyal and do everything we can in our power for other people. So when we get betrayed, we feel like we’ve been “stung”. The best revenge is cutting them out of your life. That’s my favorite thing to do because 1) you’re removing the toxicity and 2) you are not giving them the means to be in your presence (that is your gift). They are going to hurt just knowing that you are not there anymore to do everything for them. I think you should let yourself hurt and follow through with your emotions. I know it’s hard to say that but we have to allow ourselves to feel a certain way and we bounce back even stronger. As for revenge, cutting them out is enough revenge. Move on and be happy without them"

Scorpio,f3w4rw8,t3_dhrq8w,1571191992.0,"I feel like you don’t know the situation from before, so it’s kind of hard to be like “are you dumb? This is what you should do”. I completely understand why you feel this way though because you want all of her attention! She could totally just be trying to make you jealous. I’m a Scorpio female and we do try to do certain things because we’re trying to play out the situation to see where your head is. I think she’s still unsure about you. I feel like at this point- you should be completely up front about your feelings. Just be like “I like you, I enjoy my time with you. I overheard you talking about your ex. No matter what happened, I think you deserve better. I want to give that to you. Do you want to go out on a date?” Yes, I understand you’re straight forward af with this. But one thing that really caught my attention with my now boyfriend was how unapologetically assertive he was about having my attention and being confident on taking me out."
Scorpio,f3w4dih,t3_dig8yr,1571191712.0,"I actually get along really well with Gemini’s. I can get along 100% with female Gemini’s. I feel like female Gemini’s tend to read me the wrong way (I’m a Scorpio female). Once they get to know me, we have a great connection. I’ve tried to date a Gemini man before and I felt like one day he would wake up to be one person and another day he would wake up to be another person. A constant battle of who I was going to deal with each day. I also find that Gemini men flirt entirely to much and have a very hard time being committed. Scorpio women are very territorial, jealous, and possessive. That just doesn’t work out. I have been friends with Gemini male and found them to be great companions. Since I “friend zoned” them, I didn’t care about the flirting and it worked out fine."
Scorpio,f3w3x9j,t3_di96yu,1571191398.0,"I am a Scorpio. I was best friends with a Pisces female. She was my absolute best friend... I called her my “soul sister”. I found myself able to trust her and confide in her. We spent every waking free moment together. I felt like I found a friend that really got me and understood me. Pisces are known to be “mysterious”. Turns out she was betraying me the whole time, lying to me, and putting on a front to hide it. The guilt got to her and she eventually came clean (which was how I found out). The betrayal was so bad that I immediately cut her out of my life. It wasn’t what she wanted... she begged for my friendship but I was so disgusted."
relationship_advice,f3e2xpk,t3_dgcg9e,1570855520.0,"Her plan was to breakup with you, have her fun, and keep you around for when she’s bored. You made yourself not accessible for her and that put her into a craze because she’s no longer in control of the situation. Which I’m glad you did. She tried to make you the back up plan and then play victim when you weren’t having it. Let her go"
Scorpio,f38y4wy,t1_f38xi1v,1570741388.0,Ok that’s a really good sign!!! Scorpio women can be pretty serious. We are very intense people. You making her laugh brings out a light hearted side.
Scorpio,f38wxwb,t3_dfxp15,1570740985.0,"As a Scorpio woman, I feel like I’m very straightforward with my feelings. I personally have always held off telling a man all of how I felt unless I got some kind of a vibe that he might be interested in me. The staring is definitely a good sign. We tend to tell people how we feel with our eyes. We like to be courted... and wait for him to make the first move. We are very mysterious and she might purposely be hiding those feelings right now to see how you play out. We don’t like being rejected or turned down. Her giving you her time is also a really good sign. Does she smile around you and laugh? Does she always seem open to giving you her time? 

We also like a challenge. She might be intrigued right now on where your head is at and trying to figure you out. I think slowly reeling her in while still keeping a little mystery is a good move for you. Keep inviting her places and giving her your time. Flirt with her a little bit and show her that you’re all about her. Then once you’ve “caught” her, ask her on a date.

Whatever you do... don’t make it seem like you’re playing games with her or her head. We hate that and are instantly turned off by that. The key is showing her in your actions that she’s the only one you want."
college,f36xvo2,t1_f35soiw,1570718992.0,"Thank you, I really like this idea. I’m the kind of student who always works ahead. It’s just very hard with the workload she gives a week. It’s already a crazy amount. And the impression I’m getting from the syllabus is that she is not lightening up on the way that she teaches. She makes it very clear that these are her rules and she accepts no excuses. So although I think that is a great idea, I don’t think it’s going to get me very far. 😞"
college,f36wao4,t1_f36ovmo,1570718419.0,"*It takes me about 3 1/2 hours for each set of 91 questions. So just for the 200 questions that is about 7 hours. The assignments take me about an hour to do each. We have two of those... so that’s another two hours. For each set of 20 it takes me about an hour because you have to watch a whole video and then respond to sub parts of questions. Then we have the two tests... each 20 questions. Some weeks we get 30+ questions.. So that would be another hour and a half. And then studying and reading the chapter. We also get discussions thrown in there in which we have to respond to other classmates on top of all of that work. That takes an extra 20-30 minutes just to post your initial topic. 
And then she added a research paper without lightening up any of the load. She told us to find time to do it within the next two weeks. And this is a lengthy paper that counts for a huge portion of our grade. So that’s adding like an extra 3-4 hours a week. 

*Each chapter varies in length. I would say the average amount of a chapter. They’re not crazy long or bulked with info and vocab to where I could understand why the LearnSmarts are so long. 
*It is a marketing class. 
*This is only a 3 credit class."

I do strictly online courses and when I was signing up for my courses, this was the only one online. I had to take it because it’s required. 😔 I went on ratemyprofessor afterwards and apparently this teacher taught two different subjects. Students rated her ok for the other subject. Then someone from last semester rated her and said that she treats the work as if no one takes any other classes... the workload is crazy"
AskReddit,f34nro2,t3_dfggox,1570656969.0,"As a female, you’d be surprised how many women have no problem asking you “are you pregnant”? It’s so rude. Especially if you’re bloated or just ate."
Scorpio,f336nxu,t1_f2i63at,1570632786.0,I can agree to this. I feel EVERYTHING so deeply. I take everything seriously... a fight.. anything. He tells me to calm down I’m overreacting and it’s not that serious. They definitely invalidate our emotions.

My bf now doesn’t seem to have those traits (from what I see) because he doesn’t like people in our business. But whenever he’s mad because we’re fighting , he definitely runs to his mom or gmom 😂"
Scorpio,f2bclli,t1_f2bc3aa,1570124684.0,Right!!! Have 12 years to show for it 😁
Scorpio,f2b816u,t1_f2b7gtr,1570122997.0,That’s exactly how I am. He says I make situations out of things that shouldn’t even be worried about 😂
Scorpio,f2b6wmw,t1_f2b61ou,1570122578.0,"I am going on 2 years also. I agree with you with the comfortability. He is the more easy-going one where I am the more worrisome one. Which leads to me most of the time initiating something like a conversation that turns into an argument because we butt heads about the topic. and yeah... I tried to date 3 or 4 Sagittarius men prior to my boyfriend and they were huge flirts where I caught them trying to be exclusive with me but entertaining other women. That was my problem with every single one of them, and I didn’t feel comfortable committing to that."
Scorpio,f2b4np7,t1_f2atvlw,1570121736.0,"I really like the point you made about feeding off the energy with their public persona. I 100% agree with this. I think that before I previously judged on thinking they were interested in these people romantically. My boyfriend and I work in a place where social interaction is almost impossible to ignore. I see him talking to a female and being friendly- you think the worst or read into it. You confront him about it and he says he was just bored, he’s stuck there for 12 hours... he just wanted to be kind. He saw nothing or thought nothing of the matter but that is his public persona and nothing is past that- being kind. I think that Sagittarius needs their freedom. As long as you work with them as a comfortable level of freedom on both parts without overbearing, they will always want you and choose you. The loyalty is there."
Scorpio,f2ai7gi,t1_f2aa0ke,1570113646.0,Probably but that’s the Scorpio in me 😂😂😂
Scorpio,f2ai3du,t1_f2afg5a,1570113606.0,I’m so glad to hear that you’ve found that connection with someone. I can agree with some of what you said. We’re definitely emotional towards each other- in the sense that we communicate how we feel. Agreeing on how we both feel is a whole other story 😂. We butt heads sometimes and I can agree he’s not as intense as me. I’m very straight forward and emotional about how I feel where he can sometimes come off as cold or to himself.
Scorpio,f2ah53c,t1_f2afzl1,1570113270.0,I’m sorry to hear of your relationship situation. I can agree in a sense of them doing what they want without thinking of the damage they do. My bf at times can be a “free” thinker or “free” spirit and do what’s best for him at times without thinking of how much it will effect me. I try not to be controlling but I can definitely see where you’re coming from. They don’t like to be tied down.
Scorpio,f2a2jyy,t1_f2a2h95,1570107678.0,😂😂😭 definitely could be a possibility

Scorpio,f2a2f5x,t1_f2a0ypt,1570107624.0,I’m so surprised by this! I’ve never had a problem being a friend to a Sagittarius
Scorpio,f2a224s,t1_f29yh70,1570107482.0,I agree with you there. It seems like there was never any hard feelings involved when I just remained friends. And Sagittarius females were always good friends to me.
Scorpio,f29a49t,t3_dbugj6,1570087890.0,"I promised myself I would never date another Scorpio after my ex. We were both Scorpios. The passion and excitement was there but it did not outweigh the extreme arguing, manipulation, and abuse on his part. He was a compulsive liar and cheater. He had no problem flirting, sneaking around, and keeping secrets.   As a Scorpio woman, I find that many Scorpio men are overbearing in their friendships with women. They think they are being “friendly” where they don’t realize they are flirting. As a Scorpio trait, we do tend to be jealous and that does not add to the friendliness. It was disastrous and just not a good match. Also, to add... he always wants what he cannot have. He’s now “engaged” with a couple of kids and still mad that I said I didn’t want him years ago (I was the one that broke it off). He still tries to contact me and I’ve moved on."
AmItheAsshole,f230oxf,t3_db9dtn,1569902158.0,"I see you as 100% NTA. You have a bad past with this niece. Despite the past of her bullying your kids (which makes it awkward/ more of an inconvenience in your household), you are still kind. She is of age and has a good paying job to be able to live on her own. Your sister basically insisted on her living with you so that she could save some money. She may be family, but she is not your child. She was forewarned about the living conditions. You are doing both your sister and your niece a favor. They are to abide by your rules while living under your roof. Your whole house doesn’t need to be in an uproar and rearranged just for her to come live there. IMO, they shouldn’t have anything to say about the situation at all- they should be grateful. 

-Your sister shouldn’t have an opinion at all about the living situation at your house. If she has such an opinion, her daughter can go live with her. 
-Niece should abide by your rules. She is used to being spoiled. And really, she is still being spoiled living in someone else’s house free of charge while saving. She is also being babied in the sense that her behavior is being watered down by “well, you should be doing this... you should be doing that for her”. This is the real world. 
-Niece should understand no more bullying, side comments, and inconveniencing the people who already lived there.
-If you are allowing someone in your house as a *guest*; however, they are completely disrupting your household while doing so... it is unfair to everyone in the house and an extreme inconvenience. She should understand she is a *guest* and does not take over the house. When someone comes in your home as a guest and completely disrupts the world and vibe that you had going on before (peaceful), I believe there should be a conversation on whether it’s a good fit for them to be there."
AmItheAsshole,f1ojfmm,t3_da2qzi,1569647954.0,"You are NOT the asshole. I see no problem splitting the bills 50-50. In fact, that it something my significant other and I do. I see it this way- you did not complain when the shoe was on the other foot. He did not complain when the shoe was on the other foot. He never worried how you were struggling when he was making that amount comfortably. I think that as a lesson AT LEAST act as though you still want it 50-50 to teach him a lesson. Follow through with it for some time. You never know what life may throw at you later down the line & you may need help later with these proportions."
relationship_advice,f1m4d08,t3_czhvrp,1569583771.0,"Let me tell you something about people- they like to put the blame on other people without looking at themselves. You are a good person. You feeling the amount that you feel right now means that you are a good person. You gave someone two chances when they didn’t even deserve a second chance. That shows you are loyal, caring, and kind. Looking at someone you love everyday after betraying you in such a way is heart wrenching. The fact that you went to bed every night and went about your day everyday with your heart broken still trying to make the relationship work for the sake of her begging for your forgiveness says so much about your character. And she betrayed you again. She knew it was wrong and that’s why she reacted the way she did. She was dishonest and you don’t deserve that.  You shouldn’t have to compromise yourself, your self-worth, and peace of mind for someone who lives their life frivolously without caring of how it effects you. That says something of HER character. She made her bed- she was forced to lay in it. She was mad she didn’t get her way. Of course you care for this person but she could no longer control you or the relationship by her lies. She did this act as a statement because she knew she couldn’t get her way... and if you just went threw a horrible breakup, who else would everyone blame? Her mental health was her responsibility, not yours. And now your mental health is your responsibility, not anyone else’s. Don’t let anyone get in the way of your peace from toxicity. Don’t let anyone blame you for something that is NOT your fault. You did your part in staying in her life and taking on the role to give her the life you thought she deserved. She took it for granted and wandered elsewhere. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself time to heal. You deserve it."
Anxiety,ezvmt9u,t1_ey7zhg3,1568185179.0,"When I was in my teens, I used to feel a really weird feeling go through my body and I would get so angry over absolutely nothing. It’s like that feeling triggered my anger. I’m not that way anymore... but I was just diagnosed about 3-4 years ago that I have high functioning anxiety/depression. When I found that out... I looked at every part of my life and I was just sitting there stunned that all of these things I was dealing with through my life were all signs of high functioning anxiety. Every single thing was a product of my anxiety."
Delaware,ez8onik,t1_eytekdi,1567751471.0,"I think this a good idea. The woman... I wouldn’t say scares me... but she seems to be extremely hostile towards everything. She is so rude to her dogs... I hear her screaming, swearing, yelling... I can only imagine what she would say to me. I hear her relatives or friends visit and she screams at them. Our apartment office has emails from all people who live in the apartments. They send out apartment announcements and emails like that. I’ve debated on “anonymously” submitting a noise complaint to the office and they would most likely just make a generalized statement about the noise. That’s the part where I am torn... this person sounds possibly... unstable. I don’t want to put myself in a situation that I would regret or maybe they would retaliate."
Delaware,eyu6wrf,t1_eytuo7s,1567454491.0,"The kid usually starts around 8pm/ 9pm. It goes on for an hour to about 3 hours. Times randomize. It has also happened while I was sitting eating dinner. This is not subtle creaking from walking or someone who has a heavy foot walking. I’m talking continuously is running through every room in the apartment or along the hallway. It sounds like their running laps front to back through the apartment. You can definitely tell they are running. Then after doing that, they are jumping continuously on and off of what sounds like a bed, sofa, chair (from what I imagine). On then jumps. On then jumps. The running is not usually what shakes the fixtures. It is the jumping on and off. We have ceiling fans, light fixtures in different rooms on the ceiling... they are shaking and rattling from the person jumping off of whatever they are on. Last night after 10 pm I was sleeping and them jumping off of whatever they were on woke me up from the thudding it was making on the floor. And then the fixtures started rattling. I have also seen them shaking before"

Delaware,eyttjp8,t1_eypqjqu,1567445306.0,"😂😂😂 I haven’t spoken to anyone since I moved in here. It’s seem as though everyone is to themselves and not exactly friendly with the neighbors. I’ve rarely experienced any neighbors as I was coming and going out. Obviously that’s an easy answer... but it’s a tricky situation. For example, the woman who screams at everything and everyone ... what do you do there? Yes, you can knock on the door or whatever but she’s already screaming."

Delaware,eytt2wj,t1_eyr8d8d,1567444981.0,"I’ve lived in many apartments before and have come no where near any of the amount of noise I’ve heard in these apartments. Like I said, we wrote a lot of things off because we don’t think the child is intentional. But last night for example, I was sleeping... and the child jumping around woke me up out of my sleep because I could hear the child jumping and it was rattling the ceiling fan and light fixtures. This was after 10pm. The woman screaming at the top of her lungs 24/7 is not *normal* apartment noise. Screaming vulgar things towards everyone and her dogs is not normal. Her dogs bark for very long periods of time all day and night. I looked up Delaware laws for noise complaint and apparently dogs barking for over 30 minutes continuously is enough to give a complaint as long as it is not a burglary situation or for defense of property. And her dogs definitely do that. There is also law where there is supposed to be quiet between 10pm and 6am... and I’m experiencing the barking, screaming, and child jumping well after 10 pm. I don’t really care to much about the things that go on during the day because everyone is free to live their lives but everything I stated above happened at night."
