BipolarReddit,fp4z05t,t1_fp4ypns,1588311229.0,"I was doing freelance work before nursing. I made my own hours but money was never certain, and making my own hours meant that whenever I felt bad I wouldn’t work. But I crave the non schedule, being forced to work when I’m so anxious and down is taking so much from me. I used to travel so much, and it’s what I want again. But at some point I have to grow up and save for my future. I’m getting a car payment and I want to pay off my debt, but I want so badly to be on the road again. And then I’m like is that just my hypomania and impulsiveness speaking? And is a change in career also an impulse thing and the bipolar coming through. I often struggle following things through. But this career is too much."
BipolarReddit,fp4ypns,t3_gb5qfh,1588310991.0,"Wow I needed to see this post. I’ve been struggling very hard lately with debating on changing my career. I’ve known for a while, but it really hit me the other night just how unhappy I am, and just how much I want to not be a nurse anymore. I’ve only been a nurse for a year, but it’s killing my soul. I feel the empathetic part, it’s just so hard to be empathetic all the time. Especially when these people scream at you, physically assault you, emotionally abuse you, and I’m expected to just continue their care with a smile on my face and say sorry. I just can’t handle the abuse, and I can’t imagine facing that for the rest of my life. I worked so hard for this degree, for my license. Hours of hard studying, thousands in debt. I was actually thinking of going into med aesthetics, but it’s proven so hard to get into. And so I thought maybe I’d get my esthetician license as well, but now seeing your post I’m becoming discouraged, more than I already was. With this illness I just already feel so incredibly much, that this line of work is so hard. I’m either having anxiety during work or anxiety about when I have to go to work next. But what else am I to do?"

When I turned the volume all the way up it sounded like something something worldstar which was a popular thing being used for funny vids at the time. The date and time too was weird because it was a school night late at night where none of my roommates were doing anything or having anyone over. I just have no idea how it got on there, my roommates swore they didn’t take it, and my one friend who may have come by swears she didn’t either, and she also didn’t remember being there that day.

The people I met were great while I was there, but also greatly fixed on image and who knows who. It was like a constant popularity contest.
