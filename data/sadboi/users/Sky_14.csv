interestingasfuck,etw6jhh,t3_cdoj8o,1563255847.0,I would start my batman cult right now if I were you
photographs,etw66z2,t3_cbdmjk,1563255469.0,I don't know if you would like to edit your photo much or love it more original. I always get confused when trying to comment on OC. There is orange color at the end of the water that kinda distract the eyes from the flow of water. There is also orange blur on the big rock which I wish you edit to make it more smooth and so the flow of the waters consistent. I like the rest of the photo very much. A question for though: Do you like much grey sky? You can always emphasize the motion of the water and the rocks by cropping the photo so it's the center of the image. Sorry If this was much to read. Continue the hard work.
photographs,etw5x1d,t1_ethjdm4,1563255168.0,I agree. The colors of the building will pop more if the blue sky color was more soft.
photographs,etw5q06,t3_ccqqw1,1563254957.0,I love the photo overall. If you have not edit the photo as it seems then I recommend you to do so. A darker tone will pop-up the sky more. DM if you need demonstration. If you darken the grey area then increase the blue vividly this will make your photo outstanding.
photographs,etw5fqq,t3_ccxek0,1563254652.0,This will be great on a canvas. If the city and water reflection are in the center of the canvas. I love how clean it is.
photographs,etw5bmq,t3_cdn9iv,1563254534.0,While it is actually great that everything around the spotlight is  invisible. I believe the photo needs something like if you zoomed into the light and the person and the photos started from the person's shoulder until it gets dark. I don't know if this makes something but there is something needed here in my opinion. It is interesting though.
photographs,etw50ym,t3_cdj7cw,1563254220.0,I love this photo as it is. The motion of the wings are great. I wish the colors are more vivid to give it a stock like image feeling. Continue the hard work.
photographs,etw4xm3,t3_cdhbqh,1563254124.0,I feel like I am sliding inside this photo. Nice work.

timetravel,etkjpga,t3_c8ws1t,1562899807.0,Time is when the earth rotates the sun and itself. This is how we mark hours and days. The location of the sun while the earth finish its cycle is what make up time in our sense. [earth’s rotation ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation)
photographs,es22ran,t3_c5gkq9,1561512356.0,I wish the camera position was close-up on the flower rather than too much blurred background. I hope this is a good feedback.
photographs,es0yxww,t3_c52hq5,1561485787.0,I love the colors a lot.
photographs,es0yuod,t3_c52wjz,1561485735.0,This is a great shot. I liked it a lot.
MaladaptiveDreaming,ero814c,t3_c2z3fg,1561070830.0,I wish you can use your dreams into reality maybe this is how you can inspire yourself to do the hard work.
MaladaptiveDreaming,er9j1lt,t3_c0wvbs,1560624545.0,I was happy first time I learned about it as well. At that time I thought it’s a rare problem and only few people in the world know about it. But now I am better reading everyone’s story with maladaptive daydreaming.
photographs,eqyer0w,t3_bzvzwj,1560382114.0,"The texture of the photograph makes it look like a vintage photo, I think it is the window gave it this texture. Good for you this is a great shot."
interestingasfuck,eqyegyv,t3_bzt7fp,1560381988.0,I don't know why anyone has done this in the world! But this is #interestingasfuck
MaladaptiveDreaming,epw6kl3,t3_bw8h21,1559567403.0,I am trying to get better mentally and I just found when I don’t acquire new ideas about how to manage my thoughts I keep running in circles inside my head even the daydreams become repetitive and if not daydreaming I keep locking myself in this negative chain of thoughts. Now I learned that only if I keep my mind busy I can break the circle. I am reading books to change these thoughts I recommend that you read more self improvement books and also attend therapy. You need to train your brain how to think differently because now it’s vulnerable and one sided and it will just keep getting worse if you don’t change the way you think. I hope you will get better soon. I feel the same thing and I am trying to manage it.

CasualConversation,epow5p5,t3_bv2ccp,1559355475.0,He does not have time he has two jobs and he comes back exhausted and we barely talk. I believe he noticed that but he cannot do anything at the moment.
CasualConversation,epkn42t,t3_bv2ccp,1559277235.0,I have graduated two years ago and I didn’t find any job yet. We are running through financial difficulties and I am a housewife at the moment. This is not the kind of life I wanted to myself anyway. I am not able to overcome my depression so I can move on and do the right things. I just stay at home and sleep for hours. I do not like to clean the dishes or the laundry but I guess this is what I am supposed to do.
SmallYTChannel,epkkpbs,t3_buh955,1559276032.0,I like your dialogue and content. This video diffidently helped me as a small Youtuber. I loved the introduction. Your voice is clear and your thoughts are coherent. Keep it up.
SmallYTChannel,epkioio,t3_but40h,1559275055.0,"The music is not bad but a more exciting music is preferred. Also, don’t not include the real sound of equipment. You need to make the camera fixed on the table don’t move the camera around. I believe it’s not that bad. watch more recipes videos that are trending on YouTube some has 1M views so try make them as close to those so you can have more likes and subscribers. !givelambda"
SmallYTChannel,epg3cx6,t3_bukwnn,1559206733.0,"I like the idea I wish you have given an introduction to yourselves in the beginning. I want to feel that you are talking to myself. I loved your comments e.g., 1:38 but I did not appreciate the laughter and too much silence in between. Pick a trailer that you relate to and make more comments about what you expect of the movie and how much you like or dislike the movie. If you make powerful comments you can actually influence people to go watch or avoid watching a movie. Just by commenting on the trailer alone. Make better jokes and talk directly to the audience. Good luck. I love the idea."
depression,epg1fzs,t3_bue9q3,1559205800.0,I am sorry for your loss. I am sure if you think that your mom is in a better place now you will feel better. You will always miss her but that was the end of her suffering.

Art,epew9on,t3_bui8iq,1559187871.0,This art immediately takes me to the timeframe by all the details in the canvas.  I love the lighting it is on the spot and the colors perfectly fit the era.
MaladaptiveDreaming,epe84p9,t3_btv4u6,1559179623.0,"I have always been bullied by my siblings in public especially when  guests are invited at home. I have always been underestimated or laughed at. I lived in coercive control relationships all my life. So, when I daydream I always choose to be the boss or someone who’s in control and free to do anything they want. I have a very shy personality in real life and I do not boss anyone around. So, yes I know why I love to daydream and what kind of pleasure I have when I daydream and I am addicted and I love it. But I know that I am not doing what am I supposed to do when it comes to my daily tasks."
