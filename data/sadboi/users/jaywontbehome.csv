BPD,fpfa9st,t3_gczvn4,1588565618.0,Just did that not even 4 hours ago now. I definitely can relate to where you're coming from.
BPD,fowkrce,t3_g9smkr,1588121708.0,"Oh I've never related to something more. It's almost always hard for me to tell if I'm reacting the ""right way"" to a situation or not. A lot of the time I'm not even sure if the person is telling the truth about my reaction either due to past experiences. Very confusing and frustrating place to be in haha.  

Hope that you're faring well during these times though. :)"
BPD,fnxzm6x,t3_g4hqtf,1587349888.0,"This has actually had me thinking for a little bit, but here's what I came up with: I think that we're responsible for *managing* our emotions, but we can't be held responsible for *feeling* the actual emotion, you know?

Like, you can't just decide to stop being mad or feeling guilty about something, and you're not at fault for either, but you are responsible with how you act towards others with those feelings - if that makes sense.

I believe everyone is undeniably responsible for delivering their thoughts/feelings with enough tact so that they limit the amount of damage that might result, though. Obviously we all slip up, oftentimes a lot, but intent is ultimately what should be observed. So if you say you're trying to do better, it's up to you to attempt to convey that to the other person in the best way you can. 

Hopefully this made sense. :)"

TrueOffMyChest,fi83g8a,t3_f6y9b1,1582232726.0,"100% agree with you. To treat all people of the same sexuality based on the actions of a few is just... insane? There is much more to people than just their labels but it's (unfortunately) easier to judge them based on groups that they belong to, rather than their actual character. :\\"
