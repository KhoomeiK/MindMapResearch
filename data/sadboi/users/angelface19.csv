It always traces back to being f*cked over by people(friends) you had such admiration for, not prioritising you. And it’s so shit. I’m so sorry, because from my experience, it’s literally a daily battle. 

I hope it gets better soon <33"

Adam Driver’s character says “you shouldn’t be mad that I fucked her, you should be mad that I had a laugh with her”
 
A really emotional quote, just sums up the complications of divorce and how people fall out of love."
