MomForAMinute,fkxyen8,t3_fl1mu3,1584637841.0,"Nonbinary sibling here! Keep your head up. You don't need to come out to your family if you don't want to. If you feel as if it isn't a safe decision, it might be better to hold off. I understand the situation. 
If you have friends that are also in the LGBT community it could be great to talk to them. 
You can also find a bunch of LGBT resources either online or in your town/city (unless yours is like mine and doesn't have stuff like that). 
I wish you luck in everything and hope the best for you. Stay strong. It'll get better, I promise you. 
And I absolutely love the name. It's amazing."

It shouldn't be free but it should cost less. 
There needs to be some balance between having it be affordable and paying therapists well because they do great things. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to figure that out."

I had the biggest project due the next morning and I had to restart due to some issues with my teacher. I noticed I started breathing heavier and heavier. I ignored it. Eventually the room started spinning. I couldn't feel my hands. My feet went numb and it felt like the room was closing in. Everything started going black. I thought I was dying. I woke up about 5 minutes later. I eventually got the project done but got yelled at by my teacher about parts of it. Little to say, that experience shook me badly."
