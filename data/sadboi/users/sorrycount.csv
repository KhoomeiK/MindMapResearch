DesignMyRoom,euijwnr,t1_euiih99,1563849364.0,Thanks so much for the advice! I will keep an eye out for local art. And I agree about scale. A lot of the furniture was gifted or from my old house so it's just a hodgepodge for now.
DesignMyRoom,euiidib,t1_euihddg,1563848418.0,It's the top part of our window. (It's a super old house.) l can buy longer curtains for it & hang them higher to cover it. We are noobs and hung them too low lol.

Anxiety,eu2goiq,t3_ced7n7,1563389730.0,"How did it go? Did you get excused? You should absolutely be able to. You can also get off for being self employed.

Also, I hope this makes you feel better: you most likely won't get picked for an actual trial anyway. I've been called twice to jury duty but never had to sit on one. And if you do go into a courtroom, they narrow the actual jurors down from a large group by asking question. They'll ask ""is there any reason you can't serve?"" or something like that and you can tell them about your anxiety and doctor's note. You got this!"

Anxiety,ety1g0j,t1_etxyqe8,1563311563.0,Thank you. I will try! And yes surprisingly writing this did help a lot! It made me realize it’s not really as bad as my anxiety is making it out to be.
Anxiety,ety15hg,t1_ety072y,1563311420.0,Thank you for your kind words! I called a few contractors today. They can’t come until next week so I just need to try and relax until then. I definitely learned my lesson tho about leaving things to the professionals! No saved money is worth this kind of stress.
StrangerThings,etjgvd2,t3_cbq91l,1562873337.0,Hi Dacre! I loved your acting in Stranger Things. I think your future is bright! Who are your actor/actress influences? And which actor/actress would you most like to work with in the future?
movies,etg130l,t3_cb2gjh,1562781724.0,"B/c Hollywood is pandering. People understandably want to see more women in film but Hollywood's response is lazy and misguided. 

Instead of actually writing well-developed scripts with diverse characters, they shoehorn in female characters and ""men bad"" dialogue just so they can say ""see, look how woke we are."" 

They remake male casts with females instead of actually letting an original female character stand on her own and have her own story/movie. 

And when they do have female characters, they have to throw in ""female empowerment"" lines like the example you gave from Dark Phoenix to spoonfeed the audience. Instead of actually \*showing\* us empowered women, they \*tell\* us. 

Hell, even the trailer for Charlie's Angels remake (a movie starring 3 kick ass female spies) starts with the line ""women can do anything.""

It's insulting."

GoodGirls,ep87axq,t3_bt7tj8,1559091240.0,"Just watched. Not sure how to feel about it. If this is setting up season 3, I’m not sure I’ll want to watch. 


Here’s my gripes:
- The Rio/Beth/Turner scene goes against literally everything we’ve seen in the season so far.  This isn’t Game of Thrones, we don’t have to have our expectations subverted.
- The last two episodes (Boomer coming back & Jeff’s body) felt shoehorned in by the writers
- Why tf would Turner still be after Beth after she literally saved his life? He instead offers a deal to the man who kidnapped, beat, and tried to kill him. So stupid. 
- The “Jeff” problem is so contrived. Pretty sure an autopsy would show Jeff died from a heart attack and reveal when he died. 
- At the very least, the cops would realize Mary Pat was cashing his VA checks while telling ppl he is dead. Pretty suspicious. 
- PLUS the girls knew the cops had a warrant so why tf wouldn’t they just, you know, move Jeff’s body from Beth’s garden? 
- To end both season finales with a shooting is pretty lazy. Especially since Rio most likely lives just like Dean did. 

I’ve seen some theories about the shooting being Beth & Rios plan. I kind of like that bc it would explain the bizarre plot shift. But Im also not a fan of when writers try too hard to trick the audience. So, yeah, just not sure what to make of this."
movies,ep5s3ts,t3_bu14fv,1559060210.0,"IMO Booksmart didn't do well because the trailers/promos just weren't funny. And marketing it as ""the female superbad"" didn't help. I'm a woman, but I'm not going to see a comedy just bc it's women-led. I'm going to see it if it looks funny.

&#x200B;

I'm also surprised people haven't heard of it. I saw the ads EVERYWHERE to the point where I was annoyed."
