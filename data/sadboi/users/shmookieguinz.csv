Endo,fr0cvng,t1_fr06cvr,1589791144.0,"Like I said, hormonal birth control in general does very little but manage symptoms. Endo will progress regardless of use. But to reduce the effects of having regular bleeds, I recommend taking two pills a day, which is perfectly safe and often recommended if you have endo."
Endo,fqyumzh,t3_gllxwl,1589754832.0,"Mircette is a low dose combined pill with desogestrel. Cerazette/Cerelle is the desogestrel Progestogen-only pill. So you should know that hormonal birth control of any sort does very little to endo, and it’s more for symptom management. Studies have shown the use of desogestrel 75mcg to be effective at reducing recurrence rates after surgery. Perhaps due to the fact that it does give good control over bleeding. You can also take 2 pills a day if necessary, and I do this nowadays due to my endo being so severe, but years ago I would only take one a day and that was enough to stop my bleeds and keep my pain under control.

Desogestrel POP is better than others as it prevents ovulation in 97% of cycles so basically it’s controlling your menstrual cycle completely and you won’t ovulate, which leads to fewer hormonal fluctuations which can trigger endo flare ups. Also, after 9-12 months (usually sooner) bleeds stop completely for some (maybe a third of women but I forget) and this is of course better overall for endo. 

So basically, it’s a good, oestrogen-free method which will stop your cycles, reduce or stop bleeding and is pretty well-tolerated. Personally I really like it and it’s always my preferred pill, especially these days because oestrogen (combined pills were what I used mostly) causes terrible flare ups."

Endo,fqn9ios,t3_gjtba7,1589490957.0,"Narcissism and being consumed by your chronic and still undiagnosed pain are two very different things.

I think if it were me, I would just tell them that I understand that I’ve been talking a lot about this pain but that’s because it affects me so greatly and as yet I don’t have a treatment plan as I’m still not diagnosed. 

Be open to changing your diet and doing more exercise as these things can certainly reduce pain. But also educate yourself on pelvic pain causes, endometriosis and the things you need to request from your doctors. You have to be your own advocate, regardless of the level of support you may receive from family. I hope you get answers and help very soon!!"

I got into a relationship with the wrong man who I wasn’t even attracted to, but I liked the freedom it gave me and let it continue so I could move out and get away from the depressing home life I had that was just making me feel worse than my own chronic health conditions, which weren’t taken seriously at the time by my parents or sister. My sister would attack me, hurt herself and blame me, spread lies and rumours about me and our parents...she’s not mentally stable but still refuses professional help. Anyway, my point is, don’t rush into anything because I swapped one version of oppression and depression for another.

Endo,fpznr1y,t3_gga9d0,1589020943.0,"Fatigue is a symptom that really doesn’t get much attention. I suffer really badly with it and my body can go from being fairly normal and with a decent amount of energy, to “ok now you have to sleep for the next month” within very little time. It’s awful during bad endo flare ups. I missed a year of school when I was 14 (I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 23, but clearly had endo...) and the doctor called it “post-flu debilitation”. Now I’m wiser to all of this, I think I was suffering from chronic fatigue and my whole body was aching and hormonally I was an absolute mess. 

I’m in my 30s now and thankfully seeing a great “Nook-approved” excision specialist who knows his stuff and I told him about the fatigue and it wasn’t brushed off! I think it’s due to all the constant inflammation and internal fighting your body is doing due to endo wreaking havoc and destruction on your insides and organs. 

I’m not as smol as you and generally have a healthy normal blood pressure (but very quickly gets low when I am i am ill ), but the fatigue seriously destroys me. My diet is very healthy but when I do give in to my sugar cravings, I pay for it with pain and fatigue for days. Same with alcohol, it’s generally going to make me very ill and lethargic for a couple of days. I have learned so much about nutrition and gut health recently and I can tell it helps reduce my inflammation which in turn will help with fatigue, but sadly my endo is currently very severe so my efforts kind of feel wasted because I’m at the mercy of this disease until I get some serious excision surgery soon. I used to be a really motivated gym bunny and loved working out hard most days, but as my endo worsens, I just can’t manage much, especially now. Most movement causes pain and leaves me absolutely knackered and breathless. 

I long for being healthy and energetic again because exercise really makes me feel awesome and helps with pain overall."

I’m yet to have any pain relief after 11 years of “treatments” and two surgeries. I have an excision specialist about to do my next surgery (with a second surgeon there too) because my “mild stage 2 endo” that has been brushed off for many years is actually very severe and even showing on MRI scans, organs fused together, and even quite likely spread even further so I may have thoracic endo to. The reason I say all of this is to make sure you realise that surgery can cause endo cells to spread and get worse, even with the most experienced excision surgeons, endo doesn’t go away, and no hormonal treatments or gnrh analogues like Orlissa/Lupron actually remove it or prevent it from growing."

AskReddit,fos5rjm,t1_fos5oa3,1588024476.0,This is hilarious. How do you even get through a normal day?!
AskReddit,fos5n5r,t1_fos5370,1588024413.0,"Listen, I know you think you’re smart right now, and I’m happy for you. But you’re not. My spelling is correct and it shows the etymology of the word, whereas you have chosen the American variant. It’s fine. Adults normally cope in these situations, so I’m sorry it’s ruffled your feathers. Perhaps it’s all too much of a grey area for you. And you’re welcome to “correct” that one as well! Atta boy!"
AskReddit,fos5ash,t1_fos4a2m,1588024235.0,"You need to do some actual research. Please. It’s shocking what he got away with. His family managed to pay off a lot of people and make it all go away. The evidence doesn’t lie, it’s as clear as day."
AskReddit,fos4zjc,t1_fos4s8i,1588024075.0,Ahhh you’re American.
AskReddit,fos4wmp,t1_fos4h71,1588024032.0,"I’m interested in how you feel that I’ve proven your point. I haven’t been reading or listening to conspiracy theories or any other bullshit. There are genuine cases and podcasts run by police and psychologists who go through the evidence and if you even needed to see or hear any more of it, it makes you realise that those icky feelings you got as a child watching him talk about it were not misplaced."
AskReddit,fos4kex,t1_fos3x0p,1588023854.0,That’s not what I said. He was probably abused and I believed what he told the media as an adult. But nobody really thinks of the child MJ as the same person as the adult (obvious paedo) MJ. It’s like they’re two different entities. Perhaps it’s more tolerable that way.
AskReddit,fos4dcm,t1_fos3yrb,1588023753.0,"I think you should do a lot more research. I was stating my perception of him back then, and from my research, it’s clear that I was right, as was basically everybody else! I’m not interested in the media circus. It’s the police reports, the children’s statements and drawings, the paid off security staff...it all added up."

birthcontrol,formtw0,t3_g96z2x,1588014895.0,It’s a very good pill for acne as it has very little androgenic activity and it’s oestrogen dominant. Stick with it as it’s normal to have a bit of a skin purge for a few cycles but the results with this pill.
MurderedByWords,for98ve,t3_g9533j,1588008335.0,Literally perfect response! I love it!!!
birthcontrol,for7nh5,t3_g905ed,1588007562.0,"Breakthrough bleeding doesn’t suggest method failure, unless you’ve not been taking your pills correctly. Try switching to a different combination with a different progestogen such as drospirenone or desogestrel."
birthcontrol,for7ghr,t3_g92w2x,1588007467.0,"As long as you’re comfortable with the process and having an IUD inserted is what you want, then there’s no reason no to have one. Part of the process includes “sounding the uterus”, so they will insert what is essentially like a thin tube ruler to measure the womb and make sure it’s big enough for an IUD. This is the only thing that would really matter given your age, but it’s not normally an issue. Also, it sounds like a very good option for your health. Well done for being so responsible and forward-thinking. 

The side effects of a copper IUD can include cramping and heavier bleeding during periods, pelvic pain (especially for the first year of use while you’re getting used to it) and spotting between periods."
CasualConversation,for1y6m,t3_g92bkt,1588004778.0,"Keep activities short with a break in between. They’ll stop focusing after 30mins. Have a re-cap and then go back to the activity. Then include rewards time which is basically time to play, communicate and just be children. Set fun timers online so they can visually see the time they have for each activity so there’s a start and end point. Use a sticker rewards chart for good work and behaviour. Praise and encourage a lot. Find some online resources to bring it to life. I think YouTube has a lot of fun leaning resources, and Pinterest is full of ideas too. Turn their learning into something creative. Create a montage or some sort of art or photography project, or even a scrap book to remember these strange times. Let them know that this is a strange time and that you understand why they feel frustrated, as all families are feeling it. I’m a teacher, so I do really know what you’re going through, but even I wouldn’t want to teach my own children! You’ll all get through this. I’m sure you’re doing better than you feel you are."
weightwatchers,for0bnp,t3_g91xmz,1588003962.0,"Barrett Pastor on YouTube is a great WW guide! She’s very likeable! Also, don’t underestimate the value of drinking loads of water. Not only does it help you to stay hydrated, but it helps your gut, makes you feel more full, and really is the best “detox” on earth. Don’t drink sugar free soda as it causes more cravings for all the things you want but that won’t help you get the progress you’re hoping for. 

Lean protein plus greens is always my best choice. Eggs, chicken, turkey, tuna plus salad, roasted veg, stir fry veg...it’s all great for you. Include some good carbs like wholegrain rice for extra fibre. Fibre is what keeps the gut microbiome healthy, and the more healthy food and fibre you consume, the faster your gut will tell your brain to send cravings for healthy foods. It really is a symbiotic relationship. 

Good luck! It’s the easiest “diet” I’ve ever tried, and the only one that makes me feel great. Also, get the app on your phone if you haven’t already. Track everything and just form those healthy habits! 💙"
PoliticalHumor,foqywwa,t3_g93emd,1588003252.0,"He was just being himself and getting the minute by minute attention his ego craves, knowing full well that his blabbering about absolute bollocks would cause a media shitshow all in his honour. Why else would you schedule anything?!"
confessions,foqktis,t1_foqk2nf,1587995762.0,It’s probably a good job you’re not really making any decisions.
AskReddit,foqew0m,t1_foqemer,1587991902.0,"It’s the charisma of some dictators and their absolute self-belief that people fall for, and before you know it, there are death camps. Never again. We mustn’t forget this.

He’s apparently all better now, and it’s a total farce. He arrived back at Downing Street to a load of his people not socially distancing, crammed in a room just applauding him. I mean, it could be worse... 🇺🇸"
AskReddit,foqe3lb,t1_foqdfja,1587991324.0,"Haha! Don’t worry, we all have a shameful national history. I mean, yours is pretty despicable, but nobody’s blaming modern day Germans for it. There’s a very insidious set of reasons for what happened and why it happened, and we should learn from it to prevent anything like it from occurring again. I’m all for cultural progression and positivity, because we gain so much more when we listen to each other. 

EU parliament stuff - Oh yes, I know. I was watching very closely. We were lied to and deceived beyond belief. I didn’t vote to leave and I’m yet to see the positives. We have an absolute clown in charge, and it won’t change."
