houston,fr5rcb0,t1_fr5r76u,1589913361.0,It's usually my go to spot for drinks.
houston,fr50owh,t3_fh1nwf,1589900399.0,Axelrad will not open up Friday. Thank God they're doing the right thing.
houston,fr3lft4,t1_fr3l82v,1589860004.0,Actually didn't know that. I remember when EDC was in Dallas though. Wish Insomniac would come back to Texas.
houston,fr3htu5,t1_fr3h6rf,1589857725.0,Ah a trance fan as well I see. Yeah there's tons of virtual sets out there almost every day.
politics,fr2l4x7,t3_gm41jc,1589839209.0,Texas just allowed bars to open starting memorial day weekend so I'm sure that will go great.
houston,fr2iemz,t1_fr2gy8e,1589837828.0,I would say they're both at fault.
politics,fr2dx1j,t3_gm8yf2,1589835616.0,And he just announced bars opening Friday! The data looks good to Abbott.
texas,fr2drvz,t3_gm8r5z,1589835546.0,Funny how they're opening on memorial day weekend. No hidden agenda at all.
houston,fr2dfoa,t1_fr2cycf,1589835380.0,Well obviously not but if you open too soon you'll delay the process even longer causing another lockdown.
houston,fr2bzsv,t1_fr2bsk7,1589834681.0,Yeah that's pretty much the only sport that can go ahead. Nba and mlb aren't happening without a league agreement.
texas,fr2boay,t1_fr2bd2p,1589834524.0,That's terrible logic. You can like your state but hate your politicians. Most hate Trump but they don't move out of the country. We're supposed to hold the power of democracy to remove these people from power but unfortunately they rig the game so that we can't.
houston,fr2bk5c,t3_gm903a,1589834468.0,Let's not forget this means outdoor bars can be at 100% capacity now too. Funny how he decided to open bars on memorial day weekend as well.
texas,fr2b2j2,t1_fr28ftn,1589834226.0,Our politicians aren't so great
houston,fr2atyb,t1_fr2aixh,1589834107.0,He wants to look like he cares.
houston,fr2an8r,t1_fr2a8ki,1589834015.0,I mean everything is basically open after Friday so not much point.
houston,fr2aate,t3_gm903a,1589833842.0,Hell no
texas,fr28l12,t1_fr28h0q,1589833008.0,I'm not referring to them. I'm referring to you who thinks grabbing a drink with the boys is more important than others lives.
texas,fr28et2,t1_fr27wnk,1589832923.0,According to who? Trump? Have fun with your super duper missile.
texas,fr289r1,t1_fr27nt0,1589832855.0,You're part of the reason this country has become a joke to everyone else.
texas,fr2854f,t1_fr27t1u,1589832790.0,Or maybe you'll actually start caring about someone other than yourself but I doubt that will happen. You seem selfish and entitled.
houston,fr27mvf,t1_fr25s7t,1589832539.0,It was all caring about others lives until people realized that going to bars and restaurants were more important. This pandemic has really shown how selfish people naturally are.
houston,fr271qe,t1_fr25cqj,1589832249.0,"Highest number of new cases Check

Highest number of deaths Check

Hospitals warning us of potential increase in ICUs Check

What fucking data is he using?! At this rate he's gonna be in full opening right around the time the spike hits."
houston,fr26bti,t1_fr25gsb,1589831898.0,How? You can't have a team play themselves? It's just a permission to allow them. It still has to be a league agreement.
CoronaVirusTX,fr25msw,t1_fr24i8l,1589831562.0,Financial
texas,fr25b1c,t1_fr2571p,1589831402.0,Yeah I don't think the virus will just just back off because you want to go out. That's not how it works.
texas,fr257by,t1_fr23h06,1589831351.0,Highest number of new cases on Saturday and highest deaths on Thursday/Friday. But data looks good!
texas,fr253lh,t1_fr249jk,1589831301.0,Oh man didn't realize socializing was more important than others lives.
houston,fr24n83,t1_fr22hgb,1589831080.0,Is he fucking delusional?! At this rate we're gonna be back to 100% when the spike hits in June.
houston,fr2433x,t3_gm83zt,1589830806.0,"So basically everything left? Sure this won't come back to haunt us.

Wait sports?! No way in hell sports are coming back, it has to be a league agreement."
mildlyinteresting,fqyswt2,t3_gllvln,1589754013.0,I work retail and we receive these all the time. We're constantly checking to make sure they're real but they always are.
houston,fqysfer,t1_fqyrlqr,1589753787.0,"Clearly you've never been to a gym. You're literally dropping sweat everywhere. And a lot of gyms like mine only have all the dumbbells and other machines in one area so it's impossible to social distance unless you only allow one person in each area at a time. Not to mention you'd have to clean it after every use.

And the mask at Walmart thing is wrong. The employees have been wearing masks for at least a month now."
IKEA,fqy6guo,t1_fqxq0ri,1589743398.0,Yeah its most likely this. It happens more often than you would think.
houston,fqy0993,t1_fqy067z,1589740525.0,still doesn't help the deaths...
houston,fqxl0ho,t3_fh1nwf,1589733933.0,Highest number of new cases yesterday and highest number of deaths on Thursday and Friday. But yes lets open up gyms tomorrow.

EDM,fqrdnlx,t3_gkiest,1589582315.0,They announced one here in Texas too. Its like $50 per car with an additional $20 for each person and you need at least 2 people. Not worth the money.
houston,fqr5t2l,t1_fqqcmst,1589578134.0,Love to but that's a hard no.
aves,fqr2g3w,t3_gk1nbc,1589576340.0,Definitely not worth $50 though.
college,fqqxmz9,t3_gkeb3t,1589573823.0,Dude I'm 25 and am just now transferring to a university next fall after messing up college the first time around and decided to try going straight to work instead. I'm living off campus but you can easily find some roommates more so your age. And even then 19 isn't that big of a deal as long as they're mature.
houston,fqqvutr,t1_fqqvp5u,1589572882.0,Their patio area isn't even that big either. So they just gonna try shoving everyone over the 25% capacity in there?
houston,fqqrrhv,t1_fqqros8,1589570785.0,They don't even serve food normally...
houston,fqqre44,t1_fqqr95w,1589570593.0,I mean we won't see anything until June if there is one.
houston,fqqqyhk,t1_fqqqmas,1589570369.0,This is correct. Outdoors can operate at full capacity per Abbott.
houston,fqqqq8m,t1_fqqqmws,1589570252.0,Yeah I'm not a fan of Spire at all. I only go if there's a DJ I really want to see playing.
houston,fqqomqt,t1_fqqol04,1589569187.0,Well it's definitely more than 25%.
houston,fqqobxt,t3_gkciz9,1589569037.0,"This patio allowing to be at full capacity order is gonna be the cause of the 2nd wave. All these outdoor bars are now operating at full capacity as ""restaurants"". Yeah catching it outside isn't as likely but when it's half indoors and outdoors it's gonna spread. Especially with Hookah, wtf you thinking sharing smoke with someone."
houston,fqqmrak,t1_fqqlekg,1589568245.0,A club?! I've been there before and it's so small that it's usually packed to hell. How in the hell are they opening?!
houston,fqqmke1,t1_fqqfb0a,1589568146.0,It's because Abbott allowed patio seating to be at full capacity so places that are primarily outdoors are taking advantage of it.
IKEA,fqqlmi3,t1_fqqlggk,1589567671.0,I mean the opening document says click and collect opens up Monday for Houston. Still haven't received a call though which seems odd.
movies,fqqfbah,t3_gk5sik,1589564532.0,"Tried watching it and they straight up massacred my boy Scooby. This isn't a Scooby Doo movie. It's a Blue Falcon movie with Scooby Doo in it. They took away Scooby's speech impediment which just feels super weird, Shaggy as Will Forte is completely off, the rest of the gangs barely in the movie, and there's not even a mystery to solve. What a wasted opportunity. No one watches Scooby Doo for superhero shit. Leave that to Marvel."

EDM,fqomro3,t1_fqomij9,1589518997.0,Alpha 9. I like Dreams but this just has a vibe to it that I love.
aves,fqom2x6,t3_gjsiuo,1589518496.0,Just gotta find the artists who are streaming off their own page. Myon streamed a 24 hour set the other day.

AboveandBeyond,fqoiamb,t3_gjza7l,1589515868.0,This shit slaps. Kind of reminds me of a lighter Grum song. Honestly probably my favorite Alpha 9 song to date.
AboveandBeyond,fqoe3lm,t1_fqnzmrm,1589513181.0,Off topic but how do you like being a data analyst? I'm going to school for MIS and considering that as a career.
IKEA,fqnvdic,t1_fqnv5ep,1589502148.0,Yeah I know they started that on Monday of this week at my store. But our store was doing click and collect only for a good week before we shut down so I imagine theres no need to slowly transition back as it's the same thing we were doing previously. I also mainly work delivery/click and collect so I'll be one of the first to come back regardless.
IKEA,fqnv1wb,t3_gjo4ju,1589501963.0,"Ugh I work at the Houston location. Really don't want to go back. Was so nice making literally double what I usually make from unemployment.

That being said I still haven't got a call yet."
houston,fqnt5kf,t3_fh1nwf,1589500913.0,Looks like I'm returning to work Monday. Thankfully it's only curbside. Still impossible to social distance among coworkers but better than the customers who refuse to wear masks.

houston,fqjdmf9,t3_gj665d,1589408459.0,Whats even worse is that Abbott has already allowed outdoor patios to be at full capacity so when outdoor bars like Axelrad for example open up theyll be allowed to operate at full capacity.

college,fqg68x0,t3_gimt42,1589338867.0,Doubt it for Texas. Lot of Texas schools already said they're going in person in the fall for sure which is completely insane considering it's 3 months away still.

houston,fq2wu2h,t1_fq2w77s,1589060732.0,"Definitely not. I used to go to Sports Clips way back when. It was extremely average. They never got the fade right (they didn't even know what it was, they just asked how much you want off), didn't know how to manage my cowlick, no way of knowing if you'll have the same person again, and is only woman (no offense to woman but in my experience men are better at fades in particular than woman). 

My barber now gets it perfect each time and I'm able to make reservations with him so I know I'll get him every time. If you want your basic buzzcut or trim then sure go to sportsclips but if you want something specific you need an actual barber."
houston,fq2vdpi,t1_fq2v4b8,1589060162.0,My barber costs $25...
houston,fq2cfyj,t1_fq2c3k6,1589054808.0,Well I get a low skin fade usually and I have no idea how to do that so I just go to a barber to get it done.
