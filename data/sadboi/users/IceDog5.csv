The lender I am working with doesn't do commercial mortgages from my understanding.....would be curious to get more info on them. Looks like I  have to reach out to some other companies and get my self educated on the matter. Any books or videos you could suggest for learning the asset class?

How recent are you talking? I understand the premise of permitted work but figured when the property exchanges hands that liability falls off at some point. Any further input is welcome!"

realestateinvesting,fi94ciw,t1_fi92im6,1582255264.0,"A guy I know tried to bring me in to a deal like the one you described for flipping. Wanted me to put my cash up in the deal, 3 months get my money back +7% (estimated) and I think he added like 2% for every month it went over 90 days. Sounded like a good deal but I wanted partnership and he doesn't partner.

What was your personal ROI in flip deals like that? Since you are only funding the renovation I'm curious what you are taking home. In my market I cant imagine doing a flip that leaves 25%. Are you buying bottom of the barrel properties and making them gems or what?

When you bring private money in say from a guy with some cash to spend looking for that rough 7% return how are you contractually protecting yourself etc?

Sounds like you have a pretty good system down. Thanks for letting me pick your brain"

I used to be that way, using it as a joke in light humor. I still do somedays around people that know me and and it feels OK. I work in a field where we are all rittled with PTSD and we use humor as an outlet. 
That being said, when it comes from someone who hasnt been what I have been through I can feel some anger, but try to accept that I cant change the situation and move on.

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fbjjlo7,t1_fbjfnd2,1576934780.0,"This. I got sober at 17 after 2 rehab stints and being hospitalized half a dozen times. 
AA talks about a progression but there was none for me...0-100mph. I'm 27 now and my life is amazing.

The best thing I did was jump into young people's AA head first. I met some of my closest friends today through it. I had my ups and downs with it but that's life! NYC ICYPAA like 9 years ago was fucking crazy and propelled me into a life I never imagined....3 months sober and surrounded by thousands of kids my age doing what I was doing.

The steps and an older sponsor helped guide me through lifes ups and downs. Still work with him today and call him every other day.
Now I am coming in 10 years sober and am still continuing to deal with LIFE. Started my career a year after I got sober as a Firefighter/paramedic. Marriage, deaths, 2 miscarriages, a baby on the way, my job ended me in a mental hospital for PTSD, and I am getting through. The drink won't fix that shit.

We all deal with the feelings and experiences you talk about. It's what we do with them that counts. 

Keep grinding and stay well."

Being able to pull stumps and refill the hole in a few passes is extremely easy. I have been able to uproot some pretty big stumps so far. Sure I'm not pulling them in 1 pass but once I got the basic technique it's pretty quick. 
Loader has been used more than I thought. It's very strong and well surpasses the limits I need. I have put some big rocks in it and kept them real low to move them around no problem. I havent pushed it to its limit but mine will probably be dirt and stone, nothing crazy heavy."

tractors,ero060i,t1_ernuneq,1561065088.0,"So I initially wanted to go with Ag as my tire choice but was swayed away from the dealer as the primary use will be using it around the homestead for raking, loader work, as well as some customers nice lawns. I was pretty hesitant as the secondary use is on 57 acres of woods for trail maintenance etc and I am not sure how they will handle in the woods. I was assured by my dealer that having the turf tires will be great for the lawn as well as winter snow clearing. So we went with them...got them loaded...so each tire weighs about 330lbs. We got it delivered after a fresh rain shower and soon noticed that in the wet lawn we have to make our movements with thought. Too tight and it will tear up a bit but even then the worst wasn't ""permanent"" damage. On dry days it doesn't do any damage. Haven't pushed it deep into the woods yet but the bit I have done I have been extremely pleased with. In the mud I throw the diff lock on for a quick second and it seems so move right out. That being said I am not playing in deep deep mud.

Overall I am pleased with the turf tires. For my application I am happy that I was swayed away from Ag's into Turf. It really is all about what we are using them for,"
