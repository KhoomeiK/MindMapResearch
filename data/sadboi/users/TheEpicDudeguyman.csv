She left me today. I broke down at work and cut my arm up and couldn’t stop crying so I left work and went to my therapist unscheduled because I have nobody but them to talk to. And they ended up having somebody take me to the hospital for an evaluation. After 6 hours there they deemed that I wasn’t a threat to myself. So I texted Jane I was home and this is the text I get:

“look, i’m really glad you’re okay, i am. but i can’t let you do this to me. this isn’t fair to me. i love you so much, you know that, but this isn’t okay what’s happening. maybe later on we can be together, but right now i think it’s best if it’s done. i can’t let this toxic behavior go on in my life”
