depression,f9inqrz,t3_e59qtd,1575341615.0,"I feel you.

I moved about 1,000 miles away from home, thinking things would certainly be better in a new, bigger city - that, surely, I'd meet someone in a city of millions. 6 years later, I still haven't made any friends or had any girlfriends. I just keep living here because of my job. But even my job has become inconsistent.

I feel like if I moved back, I'd be back at square one. Or maybe even worse off, since I was depressed when I left, thought I'd improve, and would be going back even more depressed. I guess make the most of your new living situation while you can, try to if things improve, and move back if they don't. Maybe try to look for new things to do in your old home."

* 1 - Yes. I've seen 9 therapists, 3 psychiatrists, and tried many different medications.
* 1A - I've done all I can within regard to my insurance and costs. My next step is to check myself in to a hospital, though I've read many horror stories about that, and no good ones. After that, I'll probably kill myself.

* 2 - Yes, many times by different people. Not including BPD and bipolar.

* 3 - No.
* 3A - I can't imagine any happy ending for myself. Not especially interested in a white picket fence or any of that.
* 3B - I can predict my future by looking at my past and present, since those are 'real' and verifiable experiences. The past is nothing but wasted time and bad memories, and the present isn't particularly good, so why would the future suddenly just get better? Even with hard work (I've been going to the gym 10 years, I've tried countless hobbies, tried so many dating apps, tried making friends in different ways: in high school I went way outside of my comfort zone and join the Homecoming committee; I tried to see college as a fresh start, etc.), nothing ever seems to improve or make me feel better.

Friends are never worth the effort. The few friends I've had use me, and then abandon me once they find better friends, a significant other, whatever. I've only had two relationships. One girl cheated on me, the other said she loved me and then left me. 

My story - what use it it to anyone? Some seeds weren't meant to be sown. That's all I am: a mistake of a seed that was never meant to take root."

depression,f8wxtjd,t1_f8wsipo,1574902859.0,"Me too, man. I've seen 9 therapists, 3 psychiatrists, tried multiple meds. I've only done ketamine once - not enough to make a difference - but it's good to know that it helps. I think some states have it as an actual medical treatment. Maybe look into that, although I'm sure you have. There's also electroshock treatment, but I assume it's also expensive. Obviously, I wish you wouldn't do crack and meth, but that's your choice. Do the hippie drugs not help, shrooms, LSD, etc?

I feel you on the relationship stuff. I had a girl that was head over heels for me, buy me a promise ring, all of it. Then one day she left me for ""a kid she thought she liked"". To no one's surprise, they didn't last long, and she never talked to me again. I'm still not over that. It's hard, when you've been depressed your whole life, and the one thing that makes you feel better is gone. Well... good luck man. Hope the next birthday is better than the past ones have been."

On topic, my parents, currently, don't do anything for me. I live alone and pay all my own bills. On top of that, my birth was an 'accident' anyway. Any time I try to open up to them, they just ignore me or change the subject. They were pretty absent in my youth, too. They never tried to give me any help or direction when picking schools, career, etc. That's where my thoughts of 'why should I show them love' comes from. Even if I tried to improve the relationship, would they notice? Would they care? Would they try?"
