stopdrinking,f7rdemn,t3_dxind9,1573979316.0,Today replace alcohol with ice cream and coffee. Get that hit another way. Just for today. Nothing complicated just today. Each day off builds until like me you are 4 months off !
stopdrinking,f7rd1if,t3_dxgve4,1573979123.0,4 months as well. What keeps me off the 1st drink is knowing I will have to make the huge effort to stop again. The new found freedom of not drinking or having to decide yes or no to a glass of wine is liberating. There are a few friends I would live to drink with so I am still avoiding.
stopdrinking,f7rchlw,t3_dxhjpm,1573978826.0,Netflix and long baths x
stopdrinking,f7rcdps,t3_dxbg6n,1573978769.0,I mean this very honestly. Reaching for something sugary such as ice cream helped me at first. Give yourself the sugar hit as soon as you think you might give in. Actually for me it meant eating ice cream and sweets before i even thought about giving in. I am now at 4 months AF. It's a daft trick but wanted to share.
Periods,f7p8l54,t3_dw49b2,1573944935.0,No thoughts but my daughter has the same with pain as well. I think she's a bit anxious starting a new job so that has contributed. Sorry you have this too.
stopdrinking,f73jbrt,t3_du5ea0,1573392102.0,Excellent support. Well done. My husband is also supportive of my decision as he sees I am less anxious. I miss sharing a bottle of wine with him but happy I am much more positive.
scoliosis,f714i7z,t3_du1q54,1573336121.0,Firstly well done on the op. I have 2 daughters who have had it. It's such a huge impact on your lives. I am very glad it went well. From experience you can talk to your surgeon about your raised rib. They may have a suggestion. Also the whole recovery takes longer  than 8 months so your body may still change positively. The scar fades one of my daughter's loved hers the other didn't. Do you have a friend or family member you can talk to. I felt very strongly that you guys all deserve to have emotional support through it. I hope you can find someone to talk to. It will get better. Take care
Menopause,f6swhmt,t3_dss7uo,1573140730.0,Well done on being such a lovely son. It's a tricky time but it does pass. My worst symptom was anxiety.

stopdrinking,f61klcc,t3_dq36jv,1572641747.0,Me totally. Plus friends pretty much drink the same. I have been stopping and relapsing for years ! The bottle of prosecco in the basket rings a bell ! My husband can have a drink or two but does not start to watch incase maybe there is not enough in the bottle ! So I'm at 4 months. My anxiety is reduced. I am drinking tea as I write...on a Friday night home alone. Would have been a good enough excuse in the past. I'm happy to have got this far not going to give it up without a fight ! Good luck. Just saying no to the first means you don't drink the second. Good luck.
SSRIs,f60ogov,t3_dq1lao,1572622261.0,Thank you.
Menopause,f5yi3xc,t3_dpswmn,1572556526.0,I found my 'transit' and gut health has been far worse through menopause although I also got anxiety so relate the two.
Constipation,f5upmvk,t3_dpe0w3,1572477253.0,I have felt things like that and worried. Saw a specialist and it was the stool impacted.

stopdrinking,f5qgac3,t3_doqiwv,1572376780.0,I agree about anxiety. I am 4 months off wine but not quite brave enough to stop them totally. I am down to a very small dose every other day.

hemorrhoid,f5eyr5q,t3_dnn7wt,1572176441.0,Hiya yes for me. I like the wipes. But I read in here that using those products regularly can thin the skin. I have just yesterday bought coconut oil and use a little before a bowel movement and after. Plus Epsom salt bath. I have also increased my water intake to 3 litres of still water. I did drink 3 litres but in tea coffee and water.  Too early to say if coconut working but I'm a bit better today after going to loo. I used to add flax seed to bulk my stool but that was making my hemorroids worse. Hope that helps.
progresspics,f5cbyk6,t3_dnl715,1572132882.0,Well done anorexia is a dreadful thing and a very happy birthday you look fabulous x
Constipation,f5c513g,t3_dn840r,1572130423.0,"My goodness I have the same problem, I use flax seed but it makes my stools so soft I go to loo too often and my hemorroids play up. I bought Magnesium today to try instead of flax seed"

antidepressants,f5bg1cd,t3_dnd6mb,1572121051.0,Your English is great ! I think going up more slowly may be the answer. I only go up or down in very slow stages. This is only my thought but it took 6 weeks for it to settle into my system so now any changes I do are slow and I do them for 6 weeks the reevaluate.  Glad you see someone on Monday. X
antidepressants,f5bbyh0,t3_dnd6mb,1572119737.0,Hi. I thi k the Dr should monitor changes to your medication. Can you ask the person who prescribed to you ? I've been  on setraline and did go from 50mg to 100mg with side effects but they settled down. Take care x
antidepressants,f5b5cy4,t3_dnhi74,1572117524.0,I'm also tapering off. How quickly are you doing it ? I'm cutting up my 50mg to 12.5mg and doing that every other day. I came off once before bit it was too fast..I had food poisoning and was on 25mg. So I stopped but my anxiety came back so now I am doing it super slowly. Good luck.
antidepressants,f580yxo,t1_f57zawc,1572046722.0,I have been on them for 3 years. Highest dose 100mg. Now down to 12.5mg every other day. I came off them once but too quickly so now I am very slow at cutting down. I make a change and do it for 6 weeks as I guess it took 6 weeks to settle in and start to feel better. I've never regretted having them but I resisted before I did.
antidepressants,f57wzk6,t3_dmxb3l,1572044572.0,"I take setraline and it's helped a lot with anxiety. Took about 6 weeks. First 2 weeks I felt bad..anxiety, tired, nausea. But I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. Good luck."

hemorrhoid,f4wj0pb,t1_f4wilyj,1571856592.0,I find it hard. I eat lots of fiver but that irritates then I don't eat lots of fiber and I have to strain. Neither is great.  Being aware and using cream after each bowel movements helps.
intermittentfasting,f4whpbk,t3_dm123c,1571856144.0,Bloody brilliant. Well done

intermittentfasting,f4ofa9h,t1_f4of147,1571700835.0,Thanks. I am looking forward to trying on stuff I've outgrown. Lucky you to be tall ! Sadly 5ft 3 means weight has a significant impact !
intermittentfasting,f4oepsl,t3_dl8kl7,1571700492.0,Looking good. Do you mind giving your before and after weight. My before is similar to yours !
hemorrhoid,f4ns6k9,t3_dl6f09,1571692561.0,I take flaxseed sprinkled on surgery or in yoghurt. It helps 'bulk' up the stool and motivates mobility.

intermittentfasting,f4hqioc,t3_dkhsit,1571594876.0,Well done. Do you weigh or use a tape measure at all ? Interesting to know what the difference is as you look great in a short space of time.
stopdrinking,f4hp3dh,t3_dkj78q,1571594346.0,I'm 3 months off booze and my anxiety has dropped a lot. I drank beause of general anxiety and it made me feel more sociable. But I've been out without it and enjoyed myself.
Menopause,f4hove9,t3_dkjj1t,1571594261.0,Menopausal and developed flat feet which made them appear longer. It also gave me backache!

I hope I can learn to do the right thing to diffuse his emotions.  Thank you so much for your time and thoughts. Much appreciated. X
stopdrinking,f43bxz2,t1_f42zcso,1571340475.0,Thank you. I can clearly see that I get over anxious about it. But it's partly down to having a 25 year old that is extremely highly strung. I am a fixer so i find not being able to make someone better a huge strain. I am working on it and not had a drink ...actually better than that I realise a glass of wine will just make it a hell of a lot worse.
stopdrinking,f43bgwr,t1_f431cs9,1571340314.0,Thank you I will do that now. IWNDWYT.
stopdrinking,f3zfp1s,t3_diwmko,1571268372.0,I had 3 years off once ...went on holiday to an all inclusive. Been trying to give up since. I've had dry periods but usually only for 1 month..maybe 3....I'm back to 3 and accept I am happier not drinking.

antidepressants,f3qw97t,t3_dhvma1,1571081810.0,I remember that happened to me. It passed off and I stayed at 100mg. I didnt take the sleeping tablets. I've been on it for 3 years just tapering myself off really slowly.

SSRIs,f3d2tla,t1_f3c2pya,1570831184.0,I guess I was a bit more lethargic. But I'm usually a bit over anxious so that was good. Didn't gain weight but harder to lose but then I am in my 50's now. Libido dropped but again I was menopausal so it could be that not the medication. Basically I was happy to have any side effects to get rid of anxiety.

scoliosis,f3arj8f,t3_dga4ee,1570788075.0,Get the x-ray and jeep her monitored. My daughter was diagnosed at 11 and had surgery at 16. It's so hard to balance positivity with an upsetting diagnosis. I did but i don't know if it was the best thing to do. My younger daughter had it as well and behind my back she watched surgery online ! Many teens have mild scoliosis it does not always end up with surgery. Monitoring is key. It's a tough one for them and us so keep in touch. You are not alone x
Reduction,f3ar7wo,t3_dgavl4,1570787606.0,You look amazing. Great result
helicopterparents,f3aqugt,t3_dg9jpv,1570787057.0,Your mum does sound extreme but she also sounds terrified. Often those workin in mental health have their own struggles which makes them truly empathetic to a point. As a mum (and a pushover) its really hard to escort our kids from childhood to adulthood.  Your mum sounds like she's not taken the big step of realising her baby has grown up and is begging for responsibility. We have to cut the slack and learn to be there when needed. But it does not come easy and sometimes love gets mixed up with pressure. As I said she sounds anxious to me...but that's her issue not yours. If it's getting worse you make note that she is coming into her menopausal years. I totally hear your upset and this info is truly to help you not your mum. Maybe her experience in mental health has screwed her ability to understand normal situations. Take care you sound very mature and reaching out is great well done.
scoliosis,f3aqe6e,t3_dga5vj,1570786379.0,There are a couple of grear instagrammer exercise people who have scoliosis...one is muscle up trude...boy is she amazing. I thi k she said her last x Ray was around 48 but years ago.
stopdrinking,f3apzmc,t3_dg10zk,1570785762.0,You have a life and we can turn it around. It may take time and some effort until it becomes your new normal. I grew up in a house were drink was pretty much only at Christmas but there is alcoholism in the extended family so i always felt I carried the gene. It's great you have insight. Not everyone does.

stopdrinking,f39eufr,t3_dfxn5m,1570747250.0,I've relapsed loads but one thing helping me this time is drinking a pint of lime and soda as soon as the urge came upon me. I am at at 3 months.

antidepressants,f39bjfc,t1_f396v68,1570746045.0,You are right to keep an eye on it but I gave it a chance to kick in. It didn't make me wake up one morning 'healed' but I'm now calm and happy and my anxieties pass as they do for all those without diagnosed anxiety. Take care.
stopdrinking,f39awv6,t3_dg10zk,1570745822.0,"Well done on being so kind. It's an illness that affects everyone in the family. You have been through such a lot. I hope you have someone you can talk to and who can care for you as well. Your dad has hopefully had all the wake up calls to stay sober. 

Perhaps you can show him this group and he could get support. 

As I said well done. My drinking was not extreme I just didn't want to do it anymore. It takes a lot of willpower and focus to stop and not relapse. 

Take care lovely lady."
antidepressants,f395hy2,t3_dg2rdd,1570743917.0,I have been on setraline for 3 years. It took 6 weeks at 100mg (started at 50mg) and I stayed on that for 18 months. Now just on 12.5mg and it's made me rationale again. I had menopausal and health anxiety. It took a good 6 weeks to make me feel ok.
antidepressants,f34v70f,t3_dfidx5,1570661500.0,I am on setraline (3 years). I was on them before for abput a year but cam off too quickly. I am now weaning myself from 100mg and right now take 12.5mg. I am doing it really slowly. I am about to start every other day and if its like the other reductions I will do that for at least 6 weeks. I pick 6 weeks as it takes 6 weeks for them to kick in at the beginning. I would done any stopping under close supervision.
SSRIs,f34thk9,t3_dfiv5h,1570660312.0,I took it. Have me rationale back. I've been in it for 3 years and am slowly coming off. I am 100% happy that I took it even though I was reluctant at first.

I do miss feeling more fun at social events but even then I keep thinking to myself you will feel worse tomorrow and it helps. I drink a pint of lime and soda as soon as i can (or before arriving). It seems to help. 51 days is still brilliant. Keep at it you will get there.

Maybe you can do a pro's and con's list (my answer to all life's problems!) and it might help you decide. It's your body so you decide what goes in it. I would hope your Dr acts in your best interests. Take care
SSRIs,f0iopkh,t3_d50x2d,1568644782.0,I am sure your Dr discussed the potential issues with you. Not sure about shooters and Prozac but safe to say they were very unstable people anyway. I have taken setraline and yes it affects libido and made me a bit apathetic but it gave me practice at being less anxious and now i am on 12.5mg which is a tiny amount. I was reluctant but i am glad I gave in. Hope you feel better soon either way x
