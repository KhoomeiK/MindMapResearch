My wife had hers misdiagnosed as anxiety and just rolled with it for years until she was adamant something wasn't right. In fact, I thought I had ADHD in middle school because the overlap in symptoms is almost 1 to 1. The big difference between her symptoms and mine is that caffeine never effects her - and even calms her down or makes her sleepy - where as it has an effect on me. And when I'm manic I drink a TON of caffeine. Usually I'll have 5-6 cups of coffee and probably a half gallon is soda a day. I have no clue if it makes my mania worse or doesn't affect it at all, and either way I'm not sleeping for more than a couple hours when I'm manic either way so I always figure ""what's the point?"""
BipolarReddit,fglzjib,t3_ez8jgn,1580914741.0,"I can only speak for myself, so take what I say with a grain of salt because the only thing I have to go off of is your post here.

Sometimes I have major imposter syndrome. I think I'm making up the manic episodes, the depressive episodes, that I'm over reacting and I'm just a regular everyday normal guy that has terrible coping skills. Sometimes when these feelings get really bad I'll stop meds, stop doing all the things that help and fall into a major depressive episode or hypomanic episode and then something clicks and I remember that I'm not making this up.

When I'm manic I don't recognize any of my own symptoms. I know what they are, I'm actively looking out for them, but don't realize that in exhibiting every last one of them.

Racing thoughts? I'm just really excited about this thing.

Rapid speech? I'm talking at a normal speed.

Delusions of grandeur? I don't think I'm ""the greatest"" I'm just always right and know best.

That continues until my wife ends up breaking down because I am behaving like an absolute monster towards her and everyone around me and when I come down I go on a week long apology tour to everyone who I talked to at all because I can barely remember what I even said to them.

Again, you obviously know more about your situation than I do, but imposter syndrome is a real thing that everyone with mental illness deals with at some point. If you feel it's necessary you should get a second/third/fourth opinion because being misdiagnosed as bipolar is terrible and won't help you with what your diagnosis actually is. A lot of other disorders have a lot of overlap with bipolar so it is easily mistaken as/for something else."

Hooked up with a guy a long time ago now. He was my best friend and it went on for a month or more. We did oral a few times and tried penetration but neither of us had experience so we didn't know about lube so that didn't go anywhere. I guess since we were best friends it was akin to dating but it was nice.

I've also been with a couple trans men and that was also really nice. Neither of them were super gender conforming though so that was pretty different from previous relationships with either women or man.

Even with my limited same sex experiences I can honestly say that the she ""men and women are just different and women are an enigma"" is complete horse shit. When it comes to romantic relationships you can never understand your partners full intentions because you're not them. There will always be misunderstanding and conflict in relationships and you'll always have to work together to make it work and no gender is ""easier"" than the other.. for me at least."

At first I thought it was funny. Like, laugh out loud funny. I wasn't raised religious at all so I considered myself a life long atheist. But the more she learned and told me and the more I started to look into it Heathenry really clicked with me. There were really two things that got me, those being the sacred/profane differentiation, and when I also started having dreams with the gods. 

I know it's going to be hard to practice a faith like Heathenry without the support of your hearth, but there is a chance that he may come around. Don't push it, do your readings and your offerings. Hopefully things around the house change  (I know things in our house go a lot smoother when we give regular offerings and everything starts to go sour when we slack off on them) and he can see little things that lead to bigger things.

I didn't understand how much they can excuse and justify for their oldest son, and how I'm the one expected to make it better.

I think you're right and it's probably time to drop the rope."
JUSTNOFAMILY,f2kjffy,t1_f2jvqgz,1570286196.0,"She supposedly has things she and my father are too afraid to tell me, which brother held over my head in an argument. When I asked her what it is she's saying behind our backs, she said that she wanted to have the conversation face to face.

I know she also wants to ask DFW why she hates my brother.

I think I will probably use your method of interaction though. Thank you for that. It's hard to know what to say when you spent a long, long time thinking your family was better than this."
JUSTNOFAMILY,f2kirb5,t1_f2iphar,1570285980.0,"Honestly, I didn't see how shit they were until recently. The narrative prior to this was written by my brother and mother, and I assumed they had no reason to lie.

Ex-fiance was always really kind to DFW (when in retrospect, the rest of my family really wasn't and that's not ""just how they are"") so we got to know her better and started seeing the whole picture."

JUSTNOFAMILY,f2jw81r,t1_f2irgek,1570278330.0,It's really funny you say this because we have said before he could murder his ex fiance and mom would find a way to blame her for her own death.
JUSTNOFAMILY,f2ih75t,t3_ddjl9l,1570257187.0,"Other fun things my family has said or done

- my dad excused my brother's cheating saying that they were never married so it's not so bad.

- neither of my parents can tell me two unique things they know about my wife.
- my mom has explicitly stated that she doesn't see my wife as family.

- everyone insists my brother's ex fiance is the one manipulating the entire situation, but can not tell me why she would do it or to what end she hopes to accomplish.

- mom doesn't see anything as abuse if it isn't physical violence, limited to hitting and beating.

- parents think I'm holding my brother to too hight of standards, even though those standards are literally ""don't abuse your partners and family"""
BipolarReddit,f2bosou,t3_dcpivk,1570129111.0,"I've been on 100mg of Lamictal on and off for about 5 years now. I did the classic ""I'm fine off meds"" thing so I had a year or so off it, but have earnestly started it twice.

I never got a rash, and major side effects were rare. I had a couple really bad dizzy spells once I got up to the 75mg dose, but that's about it.

It's all the sneaky side effects that get me now. I've been consistent on it for exactly a year tomorrow. I have brain fog pretty often and sometimes can't find the words I want to say, and my appetite is all over the place from barely eating all day to being insatiable the next.

Lmk if you have any other questions about it, I'm happy to help the best I can!"

Mash a banana, break in two eggs. Mix it all together and pan fry over medium.

Depending on the price of eggs you're looking at about 25¢ per serving and they are absolutely delicious. It tastes like banana flavored French toast."
