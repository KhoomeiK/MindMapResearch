Showerthoughts,f5vlx88,t3_dpfvla,1572492617.0,Mix both to reach another dimension 🤪
CivicSi,f5uiowi,t3_dozltg,1572474103.0,I always get 'absolute fun' miles per gallon in my 8th gen ❤️
depression,ewhd066,t3_co4r6g,1565404399.0,"Oh yes! Even with the smallest of things. I just panic  more than working on the problem. And I hate myself for that. But i try to imagine the worst that could happen and almost every time come out of the situation with a work around, a little less anxious...."
CivicSi,evysjdy,t1_evyqvmo,1564940341.0,Yep it's a stock exhaust. Is it something I can diagnose myself and fix at home?
CivicSi,etsggnu,t3_cd6b07,1563144965.0,It's a beautiful beautiful car mate. Have a lot of fun 👍👍 send it in those corners 💪
CivicSi,etgms8k,t1_etgmned,1562794448.0,Okay. That doesn't sound that expensive. Will definitely look to replace them and change the brake fluid. Thanks!
CivicSi,etgka1b,t1_etggosv,1562792840.0,"How much did it cost you for the new set? Yes, I have the service history but apparently this is the first time rotors have been resurfaced, the brake fluid has been changed timely though."
CivicSi,etalaa4,t1_eta5lxx,1562622880.0,Okay will look into that. Thanks!!
CivicSi,eta53qc,t1_eta4bdo,1562612397.0,I also read somewhere that rotor thickness could be a factor too. Is that possible?
CivicSi,esn5icl,t1_esga793,1562123099.0,"I’ve heard Honda Civic’s are reliable and have great tuning potential. Don’t know the exact specs for LX but my Si is fun to drive with 197hp and 139 lb-ft of torque (these are just numbers and I want to get an actual dyno rest done to verify them). 
It has enough power for a first car. I just try to take it out on evening drives on twisty road to get used to it and improve on my skills too."
CivicSi,es03qd4,t1_eru8vy0,1561464637.0,Haha!! That's cool mate.
CivicSi,erqpup9,t1_erqmg2c,1561149133.0,It has 74k miles on it. I bought it through a dealership and they pretty much took care of all the fluids. I'd love to do something myself but having no garage is restricting me to get my hands dirty. That's another concern of mine living in an apartment complex. I bought the car thinking I'd get to work on it and understand the machine better but didn't think the whole process through.
CivicSi,erqdyvo,t1_erq83by,1561141134.0,Yeah. Makes sense!
CivicSi,erq4oxu,t1_erpy9pw,1561135137.0,😂😂 noted
