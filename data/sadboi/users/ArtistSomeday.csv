The horrid things that John does haunt him constantly and the act that he puts on that he doesn't care is just as much an act for himself as it is for others. I'm not saying Olly is John in every aspect but I am saying anytime I read Hellblazer content I can't help but think of Olly.

The world is crueler to those who want help repressing their harmful desires then they are to those who don't acknowledge the harm, like look at how people treat Bowie or how most people who pursue underage teenagers. 

That being said Olly read a harmful email and had a somewhat traumatic experience and tried to react to it to the best of his abilities. It's more than likely not going to be the last kind of email he gets and if he didn't make a strong stance now then he may get more people like Nathan putting harmful content in his emails in the future. What Olly did was an attempt at harm reduction for himself as well as making a 100 percent clear stance for his audience on where he stands on that subject. Olly was freaked out and acted out how anyone else would in that situation, he's not a trained professional who knows how to handle hearing about that."

ADHD,fons9h3,t1_fonntsy,1587925463.0,Yea I think you're right. I kind of just stuck to Vyvanse because it was the first one to give me results when the others didn't show anything at all and I was afraid that there wouldn't be a medication that would be able to help me. Considering my experiences with trying other medications to find the right one that works for my other conditions I would have thought I'd know better by now to keep trying for better.

ADHD,fonm7rz,t1_fonjda4,1587922178.0,I was taking an extended Adderall with a 70mg Vyvanse but the Adderall wasn't doing anything for me so that's why I'm on 90mg. Also in these times stress is unavoidable unfortunately.

ADHD,fonlmlg,t1_fon6mkb,1587921861.0,My psychiatrist insists I only take them in the morning so I don't begin to have sleeping issues. I was doing EDMR before the pandemic hit and it was making me hyper-vigilant and I wouldn't sleep for a couple days so any time I have sleep problems my psych's go to is to try and get me off of Vyvanse even though I know that's not the problem. Although since my dose comes in a 70 and 20 mg capsules I could just take the 20 a few hours later and maybe that'll lessen the comedown.
ADHD,fonkr1s,t1_fon4sas,1587921367.0,"Honestly no, I wasn't aware of the potential damage to the schizoaffective traits and I'm on effective anti-psychotics for that so I wouldn't notice the difference unless I was off my anti-psychotics. Tbh, my psychiatrist isn't an ADHD specialist and the closest specialist to me is an hour away and I can't drive and there's no public transport that way so I've been making due. I also wasn't aware I was above approved dosage. I do listen and comprehend better with Vyvanse and my grades in college have improved as a result but I still have distraction and procrastination problems so my improvements are few but the few that I have are major differences."

Dreams,fmfvi3h,t3_fusv1m,1586035706.0,I started having dreams about how I isolate myself from others. Before the pandemic came I have been struggling with feeling isolated from society almost all my life and being lonely because I struggle to bond with others and I struggle with social anxiety and talking in general. I even have a marriage partner of 13 years and I struggle to talk with him too. Since the pandemic came I've been isolating in my apartment and only leave to check the mail because I'm immunocompromised. The dreams I've been having have been focusing on my trauma and how I'm even more isolated than before. Last couple of dreams I had have been encouraging me to further explore why I do this to understand how I can overcome this and feel safe to connect with people.

BipolarDisorderReddit,fl6iec2,t3_fmum9b,1584870302.0,It possible to be in a relationship while having bipolar disorder but but what you need for support will effect how that relationship goes. Also it sounds like you're on an inefficient medication. If you can talk to your provider about something else cause finding the right medication takes time. It took me three years before I found the right medication that worked for me. I don't know if this will help but I have bipolar disorder type 1 with schizoaffective disorder and I've been with my partner for 13 years and have only been medicated for 6 of those years.
