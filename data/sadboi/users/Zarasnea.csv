HeadphoneAdvice,flxptf4,t1_flxkysw,1585587540.0,What would you think about dt 880 with Soundblaster AE5?
HeadphoneAdvice,fln2np3,t1_flmxpse,1585306889.0,The description says that it goes up to 600 ohms so it should handle it
HeadphoneAdvice,fln2mom,t1_flmxmw3,1585306858.0,"Hmm I'm really audiophile and am really interested in all the technics, but I'm not very familiar with it, noone could explain it to me, so could you explain what an Amp is/does/for what it's good and everything? :)"
HeadphoneAdvice,fkqstzn,t1_fkqdc7z,1584454756.0,"Why open backs? I really don't want to hear anything from around me.
For mic, I would take the audio technica at 2020usb+ or the razer"
HeadphoneAdvice,fkqc6e8,t1_fkpfnxu,1584439929.0,What would you recommend?
sexstories,fkoqm6f,t1_fkoqh6m,1584392957.0,"I will for sure, maybe I can manage to write one, post it here and then delete it :) I can try hehe"
sexstories,fkoq3u0,t1_fkoput8,1584392642.0,"Hehe, I don't post my stuff, I mostly keep it in my mind, for the fear of my parents finding the documents on my pc (happened before so I'm a bit careful) ehehehe
But I started writing a bit in runes, will start to bring my stories to paper soon in runes so they can't read them if they find them"
sexstories,fkophqf,t1_fkop05t,1584392247.0,"Well you made the reader feel as romantic as possible for the length of the story. Personally when I'm writing, I like to really give as many details as possible, that's why they end up very long. But I think you did a great job of portraying the feelings in a shorter way than me! Since I'm no friend of romantic either in fiction or real life, I can't really say that it does feel romantic for me :D I'm the wrong person to ask this, sorry :P"
sexstories,fkoorf3,t1_fkonppv,1584391730.0,"Not bad, really. Just for writing very good, but I have to admit that I'm not really a fan of quickies ;)"
sexstories,fkonhel,t1_fkom3d4,1584390817.0,"I'm glad to hear that, looking forward to your new story. Take your time, make sure that it's as good as this one :P"
sexstories,fkolji0,t3_ffdhl2,1584389617.0,"Well even though you dedicated this story to male audience, I myself as a girl can say that it really did turn me on. Maybe I'm one in a thousand or sth like that, but I really love stories like yours. You're a very good writer, don't stop! :)"
SuicideWatch,f9t54oa,t1_f9s4iq0,1575609111.0,"Nah I'm not a person who is into talking. I rather write. Besides, the connection for calling someone here is so shitty that I can't really understand a word the other is saying."
SuicideWatch,f9nmscg,t1_f9ng8b9,1575487206.0,"I can't, we haven't got DSL, otherwise it wouldn't be a problem"
SuicideWatch,f9nezt8,t1_f9neuse,1575483158.0,"The problem is, I haven't learnt anything, but I'm getting paid pretty well. So I just take this as a job for saving something for my studies. And gaming is hard when you have no internet"
SuicideWatch,f9necki,t1_f9ne8b2,1575482775.0,"But I have to pay my rent and everything, I can't afford that without working. I am so close to it and just go to a clinic but I can't because I would land on the streets."
SuicideWatch,f9n0tfz,t1_f9n0edt,1575474540.0,"I'd be so glad if I still were in school. Finished it this summer and am now working. Made me even more depressed than I already were. And if I'm trying to get structure in my life, my boss comes and tells me I work too much, get too much money for it, and that I should be fine with leaving early."
SuicideWatch,f9mdnkv,t1_f9kb6ff,1575453503.0," Yes, I am, we all are, but noone needs a unique me :) And there isn't really anything worth waiting for. And I'm 17."
SuicideWatch,f9kauki,t1_f9kaku7,1575396568.0,"I have thought about it a lot. I would say every second day at least. I would not regret it. I'd be sad about the pain I'd cause, but I'm used to hurting people and I have accepted these things will happen when I'm gone."
SuicideWatch,f9g8zlq,t3_e4vvro,1575295434.0,"Oh man, I know that feeling too well. Same with my side, am struggling with depression for two years now, just getting worse, my parents don't or don't want to understand it, have moved out and feel more suicidal than ever before. Knowing that you're not being accepted is the worst. And my partner can't understand me :/ he tries but he just can't"
