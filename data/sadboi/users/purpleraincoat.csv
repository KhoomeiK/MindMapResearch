TBI,fqlnrqu,t3_gjei4c,1589462508.0,"I had a moderate to severe coup contrecoup injury in 2005. I was 18 years old. I lost my sense of smell. I went through multiple traumatic events immediately before and after my accident. 

I have held a full time job for no longer than 1.5 years since my accident. I have completed a BA in English literature. I have completed almost an entire MA in English literature, but I got pregnant towards the end and didn't finish the foreign language requirement. 

I am currently getting my PhD in a humanities field. I work about 18 hours per week and study at home. I am getting this degree so that I can work part time for a higher wage, doing research or teaching. I live in the rural south, so cost of living is low. I need low key work that I am intensely interested in. I currently work in an archive where I am able to stay busy but must work at a careful pace to process archival material. It is one of my favorite jobs I've ever had, but I cannot imagine doing it full time. I like that it's largely not on a computer, and it's quiet. There's not much pressure aside from being careful and accurate. 

I cannot hold a full time job for long without having serious mental health issues. Even working part time (or not at all currently), I am usually in bed by 8:30 or earlier. I don't sleep well. I take naps regularly. I cannot concentrate well if I do not nap. By 3pm I cannot focus without rest, so I end my focused work by then. If I can't rest and need to be on ""go"" for multiple days,  I'll be out of commission for a few days afterward. This includes vacations or visits with family members.

I have 2 kids. They were unplanned. I have a spouse who helps a lot. He pays the bills. I cannot keep up with bills. I am either all emotions or none. There is a lot of good in my life. I have just spent a lot of time and effort finding what works for me and chasing those things. I am a fairly polarizing person, but I've learned to deal with that."

TBI,fnda20w,t3_g115m4,1586864270.0,"Hi. I had a car accident 15 years ago in December. I damaged my prefrontal cortex mostly, but my injury was coup contre coup. I lost my sense of smell entirely because of this injury, so that tells you the severity of the nerve damage. I was 18. I'm gonna share what works for me and some of my experience. 

I had symptoms of anxiety and depression before my injury, but after my injury, I found my emotions could flip themselves on and off like a switch, beyond my control. My personality changed. I took more risks. I was more impulsive (still am). I have short term memory issues. I have cognitive dysfunction problems and executive function problems. My anxiety is never ceasing. I have anger issues and mood swings. I have been diagnosed with many issues and told I have symptoms of multiple disorders (BPD, bipolar, GAD, PTSD, OCD, depression, mood disorder). All of this has some personal history and injury mixed in. It's impossible to decipher between the two. My trauma from the accident is mixed with my own personal trauma. I am learning to just accept this is true and let go of figuring out which is which. It doesn't matter. And we all go through trauma to varying degrees. Look up info about trauma and adverse childhood experiences. My childhood was great, but I'm adopted, so I have abandonment and identity issues. My parents are divorced. I've been raped. Shit happens. It has lasting affects. Most of this happened before I turned 18, so it's a childhood experience. 

Begin by identifying your symptoms. Look into PTSD/C-PTSD symptoms. There is a lot of overlap, and these types of injuries usually include some PTSD. I still freak when someone follows me too closely when driving. I also recommend doing some deep digging into long term affects of TBI. Find out which part of the brain you injured. Find a neuropsychologist or a therapist who specializes in TBI. Let receptionists know what you want, or alternatively, what you do not want. I've learned different things from different therapists. It takes time. It's hard to be open. Don't give up if you can help it. Therapy helps. 

Mindfulness. Look into mindfulness journaling and CBT/DBT therapy journaling. This isn't only about meditation. I don't meditate. I cannot slow my thoughts, and it sends me into a rage. True story. But, mindfulness can also deal with grounding yourself during panicked/angry moments, and it helps with identifying your emotions as you feel them. Mindfulness also helps you identify the things that trigger your problems. 

Look into less commonly known mental health symptoms caused by trauma, like dissociation. 

Practice radical self-acceptance. For instance, you're going to be tired now. That's okay. Love yourself even if you go to bed at 8pm most nights. Maybe you like to be alone more now or stay home more now. That's okay, too. It's a long road. Don't give up. Seek help. Reach out to someone if you think of suicide, death, or self harming. 

I smoke weed daily. It's not a cure all, but it helps. I have a lot of pain from injuries, and it helps that also. I take a daily SSRI, Lexapro. I also occasionally take an Rx of klonopin, usually to help me sleep. I've had a recurrence of symptoms from personal trauma in the past year, so I needed daily meds for that. And that's okay. 

Best of luck. Don't give up."

You might consider a neuropsychologist for him. If he has more permanent damage, that person will be able to help him build good coping skills now. It's more difficult to build healthy pathways and coping skills once the negative ones are in place. The best time to go is as quickly after the injury as possible, especially within two years. 

I experienced personal trauma after my accident which reinforced negative habits, pathways, etc. That said, I was in college at the time of the accident, finished, have two kids, married, etc. and am now (15 yrs post injury) working on my doctorate. I've succeeded despite my injury in many ways, but my mental health isn't great and the injury exacerbates those issues.

He also shared some experiences of his friends from up north and family in the south. 

I think in the South you're mostly considered suspicious (or worse) if you move often, if you're new. If you've got people in the area or you've been around a long time, you're probably fine. Poor whites and poor blacks been working together for a long damn time in the South. Please note I'm not indicating they were treated equally and not that equal treatment happens now, but I do believe *some* lasting relationships between working class people have made for slow change on a day to day, person to person level. This does not speak to systemic injustice (totally ignored by many southern whites). And this doesn't mean racism isn't still an issue. 

 I also think black people in the South are expert codeswitchers, meaning they experience racism, but they've conditioned themselves to feel it less, to work around it. (This is my guess. I'm white, so I can never know, but I my study points to this as likely true for many people) I don't know how this study - linked above - could take that sort of behavior and enculturation into account."

TBI,fdq8vu8,t3_emm4v1,1578659610.0,"I conceived within a year or so of a moderate prefrontal TBI. I had a car accident, and my personal life was also sort of crumbling, so aside from immediate care, I haven't received treatment for the long term affects until recently. It has been 14 years now. I had post-concussion amnesia for 2-3 days, was in the hospital for about 3 weeks. I lost my sense of smell and still cannot smell much of anything. I broke 5 bones. I have very little memory of things prior to the accident. 

I have two children, both unplanned. They have the same father, and they're about 5 years apart. It's been a wild ride. 

One child is much easier than two. I never wanted kids really, and I don't particularly enjoy parenting. I have severe anxiety (increased with injury), so motherhood comes with a lot of extra worry and guilt. I never found their cries or caring for them as babies difficult despite these truths. I don't deal with noise triggers though. I love my kids just like any other parent; I just don't always feel any amount of happiness from it. It is easy to lose oneself to a child. Maintaining one's own identity is sometimes met with disdain, especially for moms. Keep this in mind. It isn't something that is talked about enough. But that's not related to injury. 

Now that my kids are older, I feel that my sustained anger and irritability will likely have negative affects. I also go through waves of intense depression increased by my anxiety. I also have ptsd. I do function and work, but I often fall asleep by 7:30pm. My partner is giving and wonderful. He happily does half the work, but you should evaluate whether you have a support system. We also have a familial support system that is amazing with 3 sets of grandparents, etc. We have a lot of breaks compared to other couples I know. We'r have built a very open communicative relationship as a couple, and he allows me extra rest, etc. Our families aren't perfect, but they're unbelievably helpful, and they all love our kids, so we/I have an almost ideal set up. 

I love my children. I know deep down that they are worth the sacrifice, because they are amazing people. But, if I had to parent without a significant amount of help, I would probably not be able to do it. And I already question whether I'm damaging them often enough, ans I go through cycles where I isolate myself, even from them for a day or few days at a time. I do talk to them about it, but it's difficult. 

I regularly go to therapy. I use marijuana regularly as treatment for these symptoms, with my doctors' approval (PCP, too). It's not easy. It's not something you can prep for. I talk to my kids often about mental health, tbi, emotions, etc."

I am able to offer a lot of stability to my kids, especially alongside my partner. Y'all are using blanket comparisons without considering all the possible circumstances. I understand it's not the best situation, but children rarely exist in the best of anything. I address my mental health with my kids and partner. I don't blame every action on BPD. I make a ton of sacrifices. I tell my kids regularly that my depression is not because of them. 

It's the instant jump to assume we're/I'm unable to provide any love, support, or stability to my kids because YOUR parents didn't or you don't think YOU can do it. This is pointless blathering from you. What good does it do me to hear your thoughts based on your nonexistent experience? Hope your impulsive streak doesn't leave with you with any unplanned children."
BPD,fbga5ld,t1_fbg8dcy,1576842097.0,"So, those of us with children should just do what then? Assume we're doomed to be horrible parents? Hand our children over to the foster system? Lay down and die?

Like seriously. Stop treating this disorder as a full- stop, never-can-have-any-love-or-good existence. It isn't that. Focusing in on only that aspect isn't doing you nor anyone else any good. Yes, we need support as parents and no it isn't easy, but I'm not a bad parent because I'm depressed or angry. I'm a bad parent if I never address my mental health with my children and if I don't work towards being a better human. 

For fuck's sake. I cannot be the only user who has children, unplanned or not. I'm really tired of this refrain in this sub."

BPD,fas3bur,t1_fapedd3,1576323044.0,100% true. And the few people I do actually talk to... they'll keep talking to me. Good perspective. Thank you so much.
BPD,fas35dv,t1_fap855g,1576322990.0,Awesome! I like word games and point and click games. I'll try this. Thanks for the tips and encouragement. I'll keep trying.
BPD,fas2svj,t1_fap89ty,1576322868.0,I hope so. Thanks for your encouragement. ❤

BPD,faovf26,t1_faoqpuh,1576273481.0,"I definitely need a hobby. I'm a PhD student, but that requires a different sort of attention. I tend to stay mostly very low, so I worry that losing all contact with people I knew when I was younger will not be a good move. Then again, I don't really care that much either."
BPD,faov9nv,t1_faog6pu,1576273384.0,"I'm considering unplugging for 2020. I do FB and Insta. Insta is mostly art, and I've considered creating an anon acct to continue to see that type of content while avoiding most people I know. FB really gets to me, through memories, through connections to old friends or exes, etc. I might try a timer. What a great idea!"
BPD,faouynb,t1_faottjq,1576273183.0,I think I'll avoid this solution. Ha! Thanks though.
BPD,faodv7i,t1_fao3jst,1576262171.0,"Thanks. I didn't know the grayscale trick. I actually worry about the extra freetime. Boredom isn't good, of course, so I worry I'll just get worse because of lack of things to do."

 Ft. Smith certainly has a lot of nice art!"
BPDmemes,fa9pvh8,t1_fa9a8nh,1575885531.0,"Here's how I've gotten around this issue: I say,"" I'm fine."" Then I say, but ""my *fine* is not the same as other people's."" Your therapist will ask you to elaborate until she/he realizes that yes you're fine, but no you're not. Then really explain those lows, the obsessions, etc."

TBI,fa4sx54,t3_e6bvtx,1575808164.0,"Every SSRI I've taken has lowered my sex drive and decreased my likelihood of orgasming. Zoloft, Prozac, Lexapro, and Wellbutrin. They also left me in a fog rather than improving my mood."
BPD,fa4r4um,t3_e7s1zl,1575807508.0,"I did this. I'm married now. The one who didn't push or have any requirements, but just sorta stuck close by, available if I needed him but with *some* boundaries unless I was willing to make a real commitment. (Please note we shared a child at this time, so he had reason to sorta be around, but he was there for me... so he claims. I never threatened to keep him from our child, and he did date some.) I married that one. It feels as though I did it on a whim sometimes. Other times I feel like I somehow manipulated this beautiful man into loving me far too much. Other times I cry because I was dissociating throughout the wedding ceremony, so I do not remember any of it from getting to the event through getting back to my house to change. And I just feel so guilty and miserable about that. It takes real work, real effort to stay put when I'm feeling manic or fighting negative impulses or when I start to split. But it's worth it for my mental health and stability. 

I dated one guy somewhere in there who was really rational. He ran. I let him. He saw me for who I was and am: broken, and he took off. Smart man. I mean, he fucked me a couple times first, but whatever. Sometimes that's what it takes. But I reflect on that as the one time I casually dated because it never went anywhere. I didn't get too many feelings. It was nice. 

I think though learning to be alone, to masturbate rather than have a one night stand, to stay home and get high rather than go to bar, etc, to learn to do the things you do once you're married, I think that's the key. You owe it to yourself to create stability. I certainly wish I'd done things that way before getting married because doing it the way I did it has led me to hurting my husband when I think I might've avoided doing so if I'd already built my coping skills. Ultimately a good marriage is partially about learning how to be independent together."

BPD,f957w5k,t1_f92h6xp,1575121419.0,"The last time I would consider myself manic, I was unable to function. I couldn't drive, couldn't control my thoughts or even make sense of them even, wanted to leave my family, and had to just spend days (at least 3-5) sitting in one room trying to get a handle on it. I had engaged in some bad behaviors before the episode became full blown. It's awful, and I prefer the normal depression over this for sure. Thanks for your take on it."
BPD,f957cp7,t1_f93rwl2,1575121010.0,"Thank you. I've never seen this term and had a therapist correct me that I hadn't had a manic episode but maybe I go through hypomania. I have never felt a high mood during these periods. Maybe in the past but only because I didn't understand what was happening and made impulsive decisions. Again, thank you."
