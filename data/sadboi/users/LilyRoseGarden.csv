I can attest to the previous comments stating O-1  is probably a better chance than O day.

This may get downvoted, but to be completely honest, my current pregnancy was kind of an accident, even though we were trying for 8 cycles before hand. I myself was super frustrated when I found out how many other couples conceived right away or accidentally, but of course then the one month where I thought we did not have a chance anymore and we did the dance on what I thought was outside of my fertile days, is the one month I finally got a BFP.

Now will I admit to my MIL and SIL that they were technically right when they said to stop trying and relax? Probably not, since I still think that‚Äôs not great advice, but unfortunately I‚Äôm still baffled myself.

TryingForABaby,fkppeg7,t3_fizs5a,1584415769.0,"Cycle: 8

Age: 26 F and 28 M

Typical cycle length: Between 28-30 days

Ovulation day: Normally CD 16, but this month was much later at CD 20 ish

CD/DPO of positive test: CD 35, or 15 DPO (I made myself wait to test)

Tracking methods and apps used: I tracked as much as I could - CM, temping, ovulation symptom spotting. I also used Glow pretty regularly, and Flo for a couple of months but stopped as I didn‚Äôt like it as much.

Relevant days of sperminating and/or method: just the good ol BD so far, I believe I only hit O day this month or O-1 if I listen to Glow.

Health conditions/medical tests: None fertility related. I have some sort of anxiety/depression, but don‚Äôt believe that impacted anything.

Supplements and medications: We both started taking generic multi vitamins again this month, I also take folic acid during the TWW usually. 

Birth control history: I had in Nexplanon for about a year and a half before it was taken out in August last year. Before that it was occasionally the pill.

Symptom Spotting: One thing I did notice is that this month my ovulation boob soreness would not go away, which I thought was just because my ovulation and AF were gonna be close together. I also had slightly different cramps than usual (since about 10 DPO) - they felt more like tugging and pulling and only in one tiny spot instead of all over. Oddly enough I‚Äôve also been sleeping poorly since implantation would have been, but figured it was because I changed my sleep habits. I thought my increased appetite and constant wanting to cry (happy or sad) was a sure sign of AF and technically I‚Äôve also had all over back pain (which I assumed was from poor sleep).

Other: I honestly don‚Äôt know what to say! I thought for sure I was out this year because I had a lot of anxiety and depression in Feb. which caused us to only BD on O day. I kept hoping my symptoms meant something else but also had kept my hopes low with us not trying very hard last month. I literally cried almost every morning this last week thinking for sure I would get my period. This is literally my first ever positive in 8 months  and the first time I‚Äôve had these symptoms. My husband was so happy and I think is too scared to believe it‚Äôs true - even though the Clearblue Advanced digital clearly said pregnant he‚Äôs requested I go buy more tests lol üòÇ Thanks so much to all of your support guys!

BorderlinePDisorder,f6uy1p7,t3_dt6k5s,1573171536.0,"I feel like this is setting appropriate boundaries. Even if this isn‚Äôt something that would bother everyone, if it bothers you and happens frequently enough, it‚Äôs something would likely be easily remedied, or if they don‚Äôt want to change, that is their choice.

Just as an example, my best friend moved a few states away a few months ago. We still make sure to text every so often, and when she comes back home we always make plans. However, when she told me she was coming home for thanksgiving, I told her right away that unfortunately that wouldn‚Äôt work for me and we would likely not see each other until Christmas. We are both perfectly okay with this :) 

To add to this, as someone who frequently doesn‚Äôt feel well, is it possible that she‚Äôs dealing with some other issues or illnesses that she‚Äôs hiding from you? I think if you wanna bring it up again it would be worth it to include that you wanna make sure that they‚Äôre doing okay - just a thought!"

bipolar,euhlo91,t1_euhfyyd,1563829620.0,"Exactly, I feel like my husband doesn‚Äôt really understand, but he at least let‚Äôs me be when needed, and constantly reminds me he loves me. It‚Äôs easy to see that he only wants what‚Äôs best for me, and it‚Äôs so precious that I hope everything works out for you two as well!"
bipolar,etu6jjg,t1_etu2wrk,1563205473.0,"Exactly this! Even though my married life can get boring sometimes, I live for those little moments when my husband surprises me with how romantic he can be. And in between I just start new projects or games lol"
BorderlinePDisorder,etcuqba,t1_etctg4v,1562693043.0,"Agreed. If something else is stressing him out I‚Äôd understand and even be willing to forgive and forget, but if this happens often then I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth it."
