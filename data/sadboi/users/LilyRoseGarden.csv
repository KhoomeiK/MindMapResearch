I can attest to the previous comments stating O-1  is probably a better chance than O day.

I had a couple positive OPKs the days before but then a super dark positive right before O day, plus my temp rose steadily the days following the BD. We got our first BFP 2 weeks later.

This may get downvoted, but to be completely honest, my current pregnancy was kind of an accident, even though we were trying for 8 cycles before hand. I myself was super frustrated when I found out how many other couples conceived right away or accidentally, but of course then the one month where I thought we did not have a chance anymore and we did the dance on what I thought was outside of my fertile days, is the one month I finally got a BFP.

Now will I admit to my MIL and SIL that they were technically right when they said to stop trying and relax? Probably not, since I still think that’s not great advice, but unfortunately I’m still baffled myself. As a side note, I was one of those TTC who temped, took OPKs, compared to previous cycles, etc. I’m tempted to say that there is a certain amount of luck involved but I do hope it happens to all those trying very soon!"

TryingForABaby,fkppeg7,t3_fizs5a,1584415769.0,"Cycle: 8

Age: 26 F and 28 M

Typical cycle length: Between 28-30 days

Ovulation day: Normally CD 16, but this month was much later at CD 20 ish

CD/DPO of positive test: CD 35, or 15 DPO (I made myself wait to test)

Tracking methods and apps used: I tracked as much as I could - CM, temping, ovulation symptom spotting. I also used Glow pretty regularly, and Flo for a couple of months but stopped as I didn’t like it as much.

Relevant days of sperminating and/or method: just the good ol BD so far, I believe I only hit O day this month or O-1 if I listen to Glow.

Health conditions/medical tests: None fertility related. I have some sort of anxiety/depression, but don’t believe that impacted anything.

Supplements and medications: We both started taking generic multi vitamins again this month, I also take folic acid during the TWW usually. 

Birth control history: I had in Nexplanon for about a year and a half before it was taken out in August last year. Before that it was occasionally the pill.

Symptom Spotting: One thing I did notice is that this month my ovulation boob soreness would not go away, which I thought was just because my ovulation and AF were gonna be close together. I also had slightly different cramps than usual (since about 10 DPO) - they felt more like tugging and pulling and only in one tiny spot instead of all over. Oddly enough I’ve also been sleeping poorly since implantation would have been, but figured it was because I changed my sleep habits. I thought my increased appetite and constant wanting to cry (happy or sad) was a sure sign of AF and technically I’ve also had all over back pain (which I assumed was from poor sleep).

Other: I honestly don’t know what to say! I thought for sure I was out this year because I had a lot of anxiety and depression in Feb. which caused us to only BD on O day. I kept hoping my symptoms meant something else but also had kept my hopes low with us not trying very hard last month. I literally cried almost every morning this last week thinking for sure I would get my period. This is literally my first ever positive in 8 months  and the first time I’ve had these symptoms. My husband was so happy and I think is too scared to believe it’s true - even though the Clearblue Advanced digital clearly said pregnant he’s requested I go buy more tests lol 😂 Thanks so much to all of your support guys! I honestly couldn’t have made it this far and I hope this baby stays nice and sticky!"

bipolar,ew8zb65,t3_cn7gde,1565217309.0,"I'm a little offended at how accurately this describes me LOL. Glad to hear things are starting to make sense for you, hope you stay healthy!"
aww,evxz8np,t3_clu2ju,1564915488.0,That’s how you know you picked right! So precious.
bipolar,euhlo91,t1_euhfyyd,1563829620.0,"Exactly, I feel like my husband doesn’t really understand, but he at least let’s me be when needed, and constantly reminds me he loves me. It’s easy to see that he only wants what’s best for me, and it’s so precious that I hope everything works out for you two as well!"
bipolar,etu6jjg,t1_etu2wrk,1563205473.0,"Exactly this! Even though my married life can get boring sometimes, I live for those little moments when my husband surprises me with how romantic he can be. And in between I just start new projects or games lol"
