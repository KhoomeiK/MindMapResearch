I used to make ""potions"" in my closet with shampoo and crayons, I'd mash up berries and leaves with mud, animals that supposedly hate everyone alway love me, always had an interest in crystals and minerals and rocks (minored in geology because of it) and have always collected and displayed them, always collecting pretty glass bottles and containers, have always felt very connected to natural, and I remember one night during a full moon when I was like 11 there was a halo around the moon and I have never felt like something was so significant in my life without knowing why. I made a bunch of art depicting it that night. I have always believed there's an energy in everything that ties and connects us all more than we realize.

I discovered witchcraft because I recently found out people do new moon mindfulness rituals for renewal and setting intention and I was like wow that sounds amazing, I'd love to do that and then I started researching more about a lifestyle like that from there realized everything clicks perfectly into place. I am a witch.

And I somehow already have everything I would need to practice, including an all black cat named Luna."
