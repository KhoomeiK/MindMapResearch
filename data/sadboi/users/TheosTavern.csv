AskReddit,fqbveqn,t3_ghu612,1589244677.0,"as dark as it sounds, mental hospitals. 

for backstory i've suffered from depression and all that bullshit my entire life, and at one point last year it became to bad i admitted myself for a week stay at one a few hours from my hometown. 

they are NOTHING like the media represents. it's not full of patients who are in there because they killed a man or will ""go crazy"" at the sight of people, and it's DEFINITELY not a torture chamber for the mentally ill like most horror movies (with them involved) describe. it's actually, from my experience, a very helpful place! i met so many wonderful people, both fellow patients AND staff members, who really helped me find coping mechanisms for my issues and even prescribed me antidepressants which i still take, they help me a lot! 

the rooms are not tiny and hardly anybody is self-isolated, you typically pair up with two or more roommates. you don't wear hospital gowns, you can bring your own clothing to wear. (yes, they inspect it and take out things like hoodie strings and shoe laces or wires, but it's only for your safety. we were in there for a reason, yknow.) the walls are never white, bland and boring, and you don't have time to stare out a window plotting someone's demise like people think. they always made us do things, whether from physical exercise or just writing in a journal we kept. fuck, i even played mario kart with a girl once and uno with a group of people more than i could probably count on my fingers. 

we were fed three meals a day, AND dessert included. nobody interrogated you and hurt you; they just wanted to help you and provide therapy. there isn't also isolation from the outside world; we had visitations once a week (where my mom and dad visited me) which lasted about two hours total. 

so yeah, mental hospitals aren't shitty places. they're quite lovely."
Anxiety,fphepft,t3_fj2y1a,1588619963.0,currently in my state (indiana) we are beginning to end self-isolation rules and now public places can be at 50% holding capacity now! this is a huge step!

depression,fnct1ho,t3_g101qm,1586846261.0,"hey! i've been taking zoloft a little over a year, and this is what i've got to say:

for one, i'm not an expert by any means...when i first started taking zoloft, i was in a mental hospital so i wouldn't really have noticed any small changes such as my veins becoming more noticeable.(plus i'm really pale, so my veins always seem to pop out) however,  if it's worrying you to an extreme extent, i would contact your doctor or psychiatrist about it. but, i wouldn't worry! this could just be a more ""uncommon"" side effect, or your anxiety and worry about taking new medicine is just getting to you. either way, it'll all be okay! 

you'll know if you shouldn't take the medication anymore if/when your doctor tells you to stop. until then, i wouldn't worry. but like i said, calling and asking about it wouldn't harm anyone. 

hope this helps! :)"
Anxiety,fmxvts0,t1_fmxv63s,1586472876.0,"yeah. i live in indiana and our peak date is april 14th as of right now, i feel like things are starting to turn out for the better in this country! just sucks that nobody tried to do what we're currently doing & what other countries did until it was a bit too late. we sure got lucky though. :) 

staying optimistic helps us more than yelling ""we're all gonna die! it's the apocalypse!"""
Anxiety,fmwzwxh,t3_fj2y1a,1586455986.0,"united states' peak is in two days as of today (april 9th)! this is fairly good news, it means it'll all be slowing down pretty soon <3 also, the total projected deaths for the US went from a couple hundred thousand to just ~60k, that's incredible! 

just continue staying inside for now and be safe everyone!! the light at the end of the tunnel is upon us!

mysticmessenger,fmdtg5d,t3_fuhfey,1585977395.0,"what about the theory that seven knows it's just a game, and is the only one with a vivid memory that DOESN'T reset, so whenever you restart the game and go on a new route, he knows? he's liked you through the entire game...that's prolly why he always acts sweet. especially in the deep route lol. 

idk. i'm just rambling. 

(also, i've heard when you first do sevens route in deep mode, finish it, and do jumins immediately after, he calls you at some point being heartbroken and crying. over this, since you ""left him"". idk i'm on sevens route rn, so im gonna try this lol)"

it really sucks, as someone living in america, to see all of this go down and how our president was very irresponsible within the past month and a half about it all...but i'm glad things are starting to turn up!

Anxiety,flxzitm,t3_fj2y1a,1585592773.0,"can anyone update us about the USA and if there's been any good news or not? most of what i'm seeing is italy/the UK (which, don't get me wrong, it's AMAZING seeing the recoveries go up!) but i haven't seen much on america...outside of this thread it's mostly bad ""we're all gonna die"" stuff that i personally can't read because it heightens my anxiety :/"
