BipolarSOs,fq9qd1u,t3_ghlkmu,1589204830.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôve been through all of that. I have no idea how you coped for so long with someone who had no empathy for you and used your illness against you. 

Love is a funny thing. It‚Äôs impossible to turn love off like a switch, but it is possible for us to love someone, acknowledge they are toxic for us, and then make good choices for ourselves by cutting contact with said toxic people. It‚Äôs difficult to make decisions that are truly in our own best interest, but it‚Äôs necessary. You don‚Äôt need anything or anyone else adding to the mental health issues you have. You need kind people who want nothing from you so that you can heal. 

You are worthwhile as a human being. Your ex has the worst boundaries. He should not be in a relationship with anyone because no one deserves the kind of abuse he dealt you. 

You are likely stuck in the cycle of abuse with your ex. Google it and see if it describes your relationship. See him for who and what he is in his entirety. The good stuff he does cannot makes up for the abuse he sends your way. No amount of good can erase the damage he‚Äôs doing to you. It‚Äôs unforgivable that he knows of your trauma history and he has no empathy for you. He just adds to the trauma burden. He‚Äôs a fucking disgrace. I‚Äôm sorry to be so blunt. 

Have you ever looked at a baby and seen it‚Äôs loveliness and worth? Babies are so innocent and we often are so gentle and kind to them because it‚Äôs unacceptable to hurt a baby. You were once a little baby too; lovely and worthwhile. At what age is it ok for people to start abusing a child? At what age is it ok to treat a child like they‚Äôre worthless? It‚Äôs never ok and it was never ok for anyone to abuse you ever. Anyone who truly loves you would never abuse you or treat you like you‚Äôre not worthwhile. You were important when you were little and you never lost your worth. You never reached an age where abusing you was acceptable because abuse is never acceptable. Never. 

I don‚Äôt care if you have the worst bipolar ever diagnosed, you do not deserve bad things in your life. You have the right to be in a safe environment. You have the right to ask for what you need and want. You have the right to change your mind about this relationship. You have the right to make mistakes (so long as they are genuine and not abusive) and not be perfect. You have the right to leave this relationship and pursue safety and healing. Google ‚Äòpersonal bill of rights‚Äô if you‚Äôre not sure about what‚Äôs ok and not ok in your life. 

I wish you nothing but peace, safety and stability. Much love to you, OP xo"

BipolarSOs,fpmusy5,t3_gduc1e,1588742310.0,"It sounds like more than bipolar from what you‚Äôve described. He may also have had symptoms of borderline personality disorder. When you said that breaking up with you was the only way he could make you feel the pain he felt, it suddenly took on that borderline flavour. Regardless of whether he has borderline PD on top of BP, how he treated you was not even remotely ok. That kind of mistreatment can take years to recover from. The reason I mention borderline is because I think you might also gain validation regarding the abuse you copped from your ex. I hope it helps you understand what you went through and that his behaviour was so very wrong. He had severe emotional dysregulation problems by the sounds of things. Much love to you x"

tasmania,fouaozs,t3_g9kkj2,1588080255.0,"I‚Äôm a healthcare professional in Australia but not a doctor or nurse. I‚Äôve had to do hand hygiene training so many times over the years. If you touch a patient you should wash your hands before touching the next patient. 

Depending on how the person wearing the gloves used, removed and disposed of the gloves, then they were only interested in protecting themselves. Obviously, they can transmit viruses and bacteria on gloves to multiple people by not changing them after each patient. 

A decent medical professional should wash their hands between patients no matter what part of the body they touch. Ideally they should wash their hands before they touch you too. Coronavirus or no Coronavirus, I don‚Äôt see the need for gloves. Washing hands regularly is better for you, the person administering the injection and everyone. 

And really, even if the person administering the injection only touches your arm, you could still catch a cold or flu virus this way, assuming it can live for at least a few minutes outside of a body/host. We constantly itch and touch parts of our body or brush up against animals or other people who could catch or transport it from us. We don‚Äôt realise how we intersect with our bodies or clothing until we‚Äôre told not to do it. It‚Äôs easy to touch our arm with a hand and it‚Äôs easy for the hand to transmit that to the mouth or nose. 

People need to be washing their hands, not just wearing gloves and being careless toward patients."

ptsd,fnpzwpw,t1_fnosq91,1587155060.0,"No worries :) I still have PTSD, and whereas it‚Äôs possible for me to be triggered, by trauma happened in the context of a bad relationship where my ex had bipolar. After months of her cutting herself at night while I slept and her making plans to commit suicide, something snapped in me. I worried every morning for months of going downstairs and finding her dead. I developed insomnia because it was too risky to sleep (I still have insomnia almost 6 years later, even though we broke up 5.5 years ago) and relationships, specifically relationships that kind of remind me in any way of my ex, make me spiral down immediately. I feel sick, I can‚Äôt sleep at all, I will just start crying (so the other person gets freaked out), I start shaking, memories come flooding back, I get depressed instantly depressed, I can‚Äôt concentrate, I feel like my mind is dead but my body is alive, anxiety plagues me and I have strong feelings of wanting to die because I don‚Äôt want to go through the pain of trauma in a very raw way again. I don‚Äôt get triggered so much anymore. Some things that used to trigger me, like movement on the bed (when I bought my chihuahua puppy I made him sleep in a bogs bed on the ground because I couldn‚Äôt handle it), are no longer issues for me. I think relationships will always be issues. I can start out a relationship and everything is fine, then something will trigger me and the other person thinks I‚Äôm weird and will discard me, so I prefer just to avoid hook ups or partners in general. I feel happier this way even if it is avoidant. Most of the time I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship and I know that finding someone who is willing to allow me to be triggered and still stick with me is so very rare. It‚Äôs actually more common in my experience to get rejected outright if I explain I have PTSD and whereas I‚Äôm mainly good now, I can still spiral down badly if I‚Äôm triggered. People aren‚Äôt interested in that. I would be healing for me and I might conquer my PTSD if I had a safe relationship where I didn‚Äôt have to be perfect all the time. Being rejected because of being triggered, or letting someone know in advance I have PTSD usually makes people run for the hills. I‚Äôm a good person with good boundaries, but in my experience, no one really cares. So for me, dating is pointless. It makes me depressed to have people tell me I‚Äôm crazy or that they aren‚Äôt interested in my because I have ptsd. 

Even though I‚Äôm Skilled, I‚Äôve never asked anyone to help me manage my symptoms (except my therapist), I‚Äôm kind and have good boundaries, it doesn‚Äôt matter. They assume I‚Äôll be a monster so it safer not to date. The only way to get over my fear of relationships is to date and have good experiences, but I‚Äôve tried and it doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôve had a lot of rejection if I tell people I have ptsd before we meet or at the most moments where I‚Äôm triggered. Avoidance might not be healthy, but neither is exposing myself to people who treated me like I‚Äôm crazy when they find out I have PTSD. I‚Äôm happier being single. I have heaps of friends and family who accept me, my clients appreciate me, as do my colleagues so that‚Äôs enough for me. 

I‚Äôd never say I‚Äôm better because I know I‚Äôm not. I still avoid things, but I‚Äôm a lot better thanks to therapy and acceptance from friends and family. 

I wish you all the very best. PTSD can change and morph. There are triggers you‚Äôre aware of that you can work on, but there can be deeper, less apparent triggers that can negatively affect you even worse. Unaccepting people make it infinitely worse too. Not everyone is like my ex or the people I dated, but the kind people, where there‚Äôs a mutual attraction, are so hard to find in my experience"

Somehow I went to work everyday because I was too fearful of staying at home with my own mind. Work became a very necessary distraction for me. I was surprised I could work. I know that years beforehand, I couldn‚Äôt even talk about what had happened because I knew it would render me completely unable to function. It was scary so I shut my mouth for years until I was triggered so badly I couldn‚Äôt handle it and could no longer hide it. I have no idea how I functioned at work.

BipolarSOs,fnknqcb,t3_g299wl,1587034071.0,"Yeah, unfortunately I can relate. My ex broke up with me out of the blue via Facebook messenger. She never discussed it with me. I was pretty broken after the relationship and just wanted to be left alone. I wanted a future with her but her bipolar got so bad, I realised a future with her just wasn‚Äôt possible. Anyway, after breaking up, she pretty much insisted on contacting me whenever she felt like it which wasn‚Äôt healthy for me. Somehow we managed to be friends for a year after we broke up. I was mainly a friend and support to her. She never really reciprocated. A little over a year later, when she seemed to be getting better and respecting my boundaries more she had an urgent desire to call me, even though I told her I wasn‚Äôt feeling well that evening, but she insisted. All she wanted to tell me is that god told her she couldn‚Äôt be friends with me anymore. It really hurt me more than the breakup. I‚Äôd endured a lot of her shit and we‚Äôd somehow managed to be friends despite everything. Two weeks prior to telling me she was ghosting next, she‚Äôd told me in-person that I was still her best friend. 

Anyway, I guess her delusions won. She blocked me on everything and that was it. That was 4.5 years ago. Two months ago on my birthday, I received an email from her saying she was coming to visit my country and wanted to meet up with me to ‚Äúdiscuss something‚Äù. She wouldn‚Äôt even know what city I live in or that I‚Äôm constantly travelling for work. I guess she thinks my life is exactly the same as it was in November 2015. 

After 4+ years there was no way I wanted to invite her shit back into my life. I have PTSD as a result of the relationship. I‚Äôll never be the same again, but I‚Äôm so mentally well these days and I don‚Äôt want her creeping in and destroying that again. So I blocked her email address and didn‚Äôt respond. 

She just does whatever she wants and has no regard for me. She has empathy for others, but not for me so, like you, there‚Äôs no way I trust her to be back in my life. There‚Äôs also nothing in it for me. I have no idea what she wants to ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù but I know for certain I‚Äôm not interested in it. I gave her a chance to be friends and she blew it in a very cruel way. She knew I was ghosted by a really good friend in the past and how it impacted me. She‚Äôd also been ghosted by a friend and it really hurt her at the time. But yeah, she felt justified in doing the same thing because god. I can‚Äôt change the fact that she was a big part of my past, but I can stop her from being in my future.

ptsd,fn8lq2w,t3_g04z6n,1586744529.0,"In my experience, psych wards can be full of toxic workers. There are a few nice ones, but mainly they treat people like cattle and play games with them if they have BPD, referring to some very unwell people who often present to the psych ward as ‚Äúfrequent fliers‚Äù. I personally would never want to work on a psych ward again. They‚Äôre hotbeds for toxic staff (the majority of them are like this in my experience, not all of them). It‚Äôs damaging to me to see how they operate. Feels like we‚Äôre still living in the dark ages when I go into those places.

I‚Äôm a psychologist and I have PTSD. I developed PTSD many years after I became a psychologist. I learnt a lot of therapies and strategies to manage difficult people before I developed PTSD, so even if I‚Äôve been really triggered in my personal life, work becomes my safe haven where I‚Äôm not stuck fixating on the PTSD symptoms that I‚Äôd do almost anything to avoid. When I see my clients during those times, it calms me and I can focus while I‚Äôm treating them. I recall a few times where I was shaking while seeing a client because of my own mental state and not to do with anything my client said or did. I just put my hand down on my desk or my notepad so my client doesn‚Äôt see I‚Äôm shaking. It‚Äôs kind of like I go into automatic pilot because I‚Äôve been a psychologist for so long. I‚Äôve often wondered how I would have coped if I had PTSD when I was first starting out as a psychologist.

The biggest, main time my PTSD was triggered (in my personal life) I was working with a lovely team of psychologists in an military health centre setting. Sometimes I would be having a lot of trouble focusing on what I was supposed to be doing on the computer because I couldn‚Äôt concentrate. One morning I had 3 back to back clients who all had some really horrific stories to tell. It was super distressing by the time I finished so I went and debriefed with another psychologist in her office. I broke down in front of her. I felt safe with her because I‚Äôd recently confessed to her I had PTSD and she was really nice about it. Then after I‚Äôd spoken to her, like magic, I‚Äôd just dissociate from my feelings, dry my eyes and see my next client and be totally present for them. I really felt like I was acting automatically based on my years of experience. My empathy was extreme and it gave me insights into my clients that I would have never otherwise had. One of them submitted a compliment about how good I was as a psychologist. At home I would fall apart but try my best to remain functional. It was hard. Many months later, that nice psychologist told me the reason she has to go on sick leave often for a month at a time was because she battled with bipolar. She was an excellent psychologist and a beautifully compassionate friend to me when I needed it the most. 

The reality is that even if we don‚Äôt start out with psychiatric conditions, anyone can develop them in the course of their life. That shouldn‚Äôt stop anyone pursuing a career. Keep studying and don‚Äôt listen to the people who put doubt in your mind. They limit you and they are also unkind people who shouldn‚Äôt be working in the mental health field. You can be even more effective as a psychologist if you have PTSD. It will give you a sensitivity that will cause you both pain and suffering and also genuine empathy and compassion for others. You know your limits. You wouldn‚Äôt get into this field if you didn‚Äôt think you could do it. Also, working in prisons and psych wards is pretty soul crushing. There are so many other places you could work as a psychologist where toxicity isn‚Äôt an acceptable part of the team culture.

BipolarSOs,fn8fwi6,t1_fn8bcax,1586740734.0,"Yeah, I sacrificed everything to be with my ex who had BP. I quit my job, sold my car and moved to the other side of the world so we could both relocate to where she had family, friends and a mental health team to support her. I did everything I could to help my partner and our relationship. The bipolar just got too strong. Neither me nor my ex were any match for the destructive force this disorder brought to our lives. She fought hard and so did I. The relationship robbed me of my confidence, self-esteem, identity and good mental health. In its place I was left with PTSD. I had to come home and rebuild my life from nothing. I had debt, no job, no home, no family support, no support from my ex with BP (even though she would often still contact me and needed my help). I had 2 suitcases and a backpack and a few thousand dollars in debt. I guess there used to be a romantic side to me as well. That‚Äôs dead now. Relationships are now one of my biggest PTSD triggers so I avoid them. 

And yes, everything is far more complex than most people will acknowledge. I wish everyone had the fairytale outcome too. Bipolar morphs and changes in unexpected ways over time and both the sufferer and anyone who loves them have to continually adapt. Anyone who thinks they completely understand their bipolar today and thinks it will always affect them as it does now has a shock coming for them. I hate bipolar, but I have a lot of compassion for the individuals. I could never be in a relationship with someone who has bipolar again though. It‚Äôs a massive trigger for me. Even intensity in a relationship is a massive trigger that will send me into a rapid downward spiral because it triggers my PTSD. All bipolar symptoms, even if the individual doesn‚Äôt have bipolar, is too much for my brain. My brain says it‚Äôs all too risky so it will send me into panic, depression and shaking for months on end. Thankfully when I avoid relationships I‚Äôm 99% fine. But yeah, I hate bipolar and how it ruins good things and people. I certainly don‚Äôt hate people with bipolar. They are victims of a cruel, life changing disorder that they never asked for. I loved my ex, but I didn‚Äôt love some of how she treated me."
BipolarSOs,fn802l8,t1_fn3oahg,1586731107.0,"Yes, this sub is designed for people like you and I; the ones who are the SOs to our BP partners/exes. In the description it says the SO can have BP too, but many of us do not. Like you, I developed trauma from being with my ex who had BP. The OP said in one of her comments that you have to be a strong person f you‚Äôre going to be in a relationship with someone who has BP and make it work. I hate when people say those things. Strong people also leave relationships that aren‚Äôt good for their mental health. There is no glory in putting one‚Äôs self through continual pain. 

Strong and loving people also get left by their BP partners. The reasons for breaking up are so diverse. People will sometimes leave as a protective move if the BP partner‚Äôs behaviour starts negatively impacting their children. Those people can put up with all the troubles bipolar has created in their relationship, but they draw the line once someone begins negatively impacting children, and good on them. Some people aren‚Äôt in a position to leave if they have kids, or even if they don‚Äôt have kids so they stay. That doesn‚Äôt make a person weak or strong. 

The OP has clearly edited their original post above to tone down some of the incorrect things about people with bipolar being narcissistic and that‚Äôs what makes them abusive, not the bipolar itself. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth in most cases. Most people with bipolar will go through manic/hypomanic periods where they become grandiose, but that‚Äôs a result of bipolar, not narcissism. I think it defeats the purpose of the OP‚Äôs desire to spread positivity here if she‚Äôs going to box the people who can be abusive and have bipolar into the category of ‚Äòpeople who were just horrible and abusive to begin with‚Äô. 

I have tried to explain things to the OP so maybe that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs changed her original post, but in her comments back to me she is defensive, hasn‚Äôt read my comments properly in some cases and certainly shows no concern for a good portion of bipolar that she just threw under the bus. I agree with the spirit of what she says, but not everything she says because it‚Äôs wrong and only represents a small portion of people with BP. She doesn‚Äôt acknowledge this at all. Just responds in a bit of a defensive way and makes out I didn‚Äôt understand what she was trying to say, while at the same time showing my intentions no understanding. 

She wants to say there‚Äôs hope for people with bipolar to live happy and healthy lives with intact relationships so long as they don‚Äôt have a propensity for aggression/abusive behaviour that she has attributed to narcissism etc. That‚Äôs a really dangerous message to be espousing on a sub where many people with bipolar lurk/post, and it‚Äôs also dangerous for the SOs who might start pathologising their BP partner‚Äôs behaviours as being more sinister than just bipolar. She doesn‚Äôt seem to acknowledge at all that bipolar isn‚Äôt one thing and it can affect its sufferers so differently, or especially that it can turn nice people into nightmares. It can turn a kind, loving person into someone barely recognisable. 

There is no way that bipolar can not negatively effect the peace and harmony that could otherwise exist in a relationship if the partner didn‚Äôt have bipolar. It‚Äôs foolish of the OP to suggest it can or to suggest the partner lacks the necessary fortitude to put up with all the unique challenges of loving someone who has bipolar and imply the SO is not strong enough if it turns out the relationship fails.

She said that we as the SOs might feel alone but think of how alone they feel having bipolar. In fact, that‚Äôs all I did when I was with my BP ex - I only thought of her and helping her. Looking back, that was foolish of me. My ex only thought of herself as well and would invalidate any feelings I had because she always had it worse than me; she had bipolar. The constant invalidation I copped was cruel to say the least. It was unempathic and to have a partner who changes to having no empathy for me (but had empathy for other people she knew had bipolar from her support groups) was gutting. There was a lot of support for my BP ex, and even though we were very poor, most of our money went to help for her. Help that already existed in terms of psychiatric appointments and psychologist appointments. There was zero support from her family for me and none in the community. I would drive her around in the car to soothe her, but her things like video games to distract her while I was at work and she wasn‚Äôt coping with her illness when I wasn‚Äôt around. My ex described me to her psychologist one time as her Carer and said it was unfair for me to be in that position. I got zero help. We couldn‚Äôt afford it after all our money went into my ex and trying to get her a little but better. This sub has been the only place I‚Äôve ever felt validated and it‚Äôs been so healing. It doesn‚Äôt take much - just a little bit of validation and we feel so much better knowing we‚Äôre not alone. 

Thank you for sharing a little bit of what it‚Äôs like to be married to someone with BP for 20 years. It sounds incredibly exhausting to have to take care of your partner and children at the same time. Much love to you x"
BipolarSOs,fn6gffj,t1_fn68s3z,1586698585.0,"I haven‚Äôt read many of the replies to your original post. The only ones I saw were people who agreed wholeheartedly with you. I just wanted to chime in with my own brand of justice/positivity when I saw you saying that people who have bipolar and are behaving abusively are doing so because they are narcissists or other psychopathologies, and that‚Äôs not necessarily true. I worried that your comments, left unchallenged, might hurt others with bipolar who look at this sub."
BipolarSOs,fn5i6m0,t1_fn38yhg,1586665526.0,"I think you agree with me in regards to medication. Like I said above, medication doesn‚Äôt work for everyone. It didn‚Äôt work for my ex. In fact, it made her much, much worse. More depressed and suicidal. Barely functional at all. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd never say medication is the answer. There‚Äôs so much more the medical field needs to do to treat the underlying causes of bipolar instead of acting like medication is a panacea. The long term use of antipsychotics isn‚Äôt good. In fact, I dare say it‚Äôs part of the reason why people with psychiatric conditions will rarely reach life expectancy, but I won‚Äôt go into that here because medication can work somewhat for some people.

I can imagine it is frustrating when you share your thoughts and other people have different opinions. I very much agree with the spirit of what you were saying, but I cannot agree with it wholeheartedly for the reasons I mentioned in my previous comment. It‚Äôs important to be positive as you said. It gives people hope. I think it‚Äôs also important to be inclusive and not to assume that people with a different experience of bipolar might just be behaving badly. Sometimes that‚Äôs the case, but oftentimes the bipolar takes them over and changes the way they think and behave. Their behaviour may sometimes be bad, but they are rarely bad people with malicious intent. It‚Äôs a difficult and contentious topic. It‚Äôs so complex and idiosyncratic. 

Please know I do not intend to hurt you in any way or to take away your positivity or the worth of your lovely relationship with your partner. I only want the very best for you and everyone here. My comment was around not wanting anyone to feel excluded or hurt by your comments. I know you mean no harm, neither did I in my previous comment, but it burst your bubble anyway. I want the same thing as you - I just don‚Äôt want people with bipolar feeling any worse about themselves. 

It‚Äôs brave of you to open yourself up here, and like I said, I appreciate the positive spirit of your message. Whenever we open up about what we think we open ourselves up to feedback. That feedback may be what we want to hear, but it might not be either. It‚Äôs completely outside of our control. It‚Äôs ok for people to disagree with us, but I hope they do it respectfully and with kindness. 

I know this sub piques your curiosity and everyone is welcome here, but because we cannot control what people say, I would never encourage anyone with BP to look at this sub, and I‚Äôd never encourage anyone in a happy relationship to look at it either. It puts too much fear and doubt into people‚Äôs minds. But it can be really validating to the SOs of people who have bipolar. There‚Äôs no support for people like me who were in a relationship with someone with BP either when I was with my ex or after we broke up. I felt so alone for so long. This sub has been so helpful for me, but I wouldn‚Äôt ever encourage someone with BP to look at this sub. It can only be damaging for them. I can‚Äôt see how it could ever help. 

Take care, friend x"
BipolarSOs,fn36203,t1_fn2ttnr,1586613741.0,"I wish that were true. A disorder is only diagnosed if it is interfering with important aspects of a person‚Äôs functioning like work, relationships, etc. 

Bipolar can make otherwise good human beings do and say really awful things. There are many types of bipolar and there are different levels of severity. Bipolar can make people have grandiose thoughts about themselves because they are delusional/actively psychotic at the time. Later they may realise they were unwell and no longer think or feel the same way they did when they were very unwell. 

Bipolar will change the way a person thinks and behaves. I think it‚Äôs useful to separate the person who has bipolar from the bipolar itself because bipolar, depending on severity, will sometimes/oftentimes make them them say and do things that are against their own values. It‚Äôs an awfully destructive condition that can make people take their own lives. It can be very damaging for some people and no medication really helps. Of all the psychiatric disorders, sufferers of BP take their own lives more frequently than people with any other psychiatric condition. It absolutely broke my heart and ruined me to see my BP ex go through all she did. She worked so hard to get better, but in the end, the bipolar was stronger than everything else. It got worse and worse. It took my loving partner and turned her into someone who couldn‚Äôt work, would cut herself and plot her suicide all the time, it took her away from the real world and kept her prisoner in her own mind. Sometimes she was ultra paranoid, sometimes she was ridiculously happy because she thought god was speaking to her. She wasn‚Äôt an abusive person, but bipolar changed her. 

I don‚Äôt know what she will do when her mother dies or who will look out for her then. She‚Äôs very vulnerable and her mind is highly suggestible. She will likely be abused and taken advantage of, and she may end up with no place to call home. It‚Äôs so sad. She used to be so, so smart and had an analytical mind. Now she just believes whatever her head tells her. She could be experiencing back pain and she will think there‚Äôs a demon that‚Äôs possessed her gnawing on her spine. 

She‚Äôs not a bad person. Life gave her bipolar, and without meaning to, my BP ex gave me trauma. If she didn‚Äôt have bipolar, she‚Äôd be more accountable and I would have thought she was a bad person even if she didn‚Äôt start out bad. But bipolar does explain the very unusual way she thought about everything and it explains her actions when she‚Äôs very unwell. 

I‚Äôm glad your bipolar isn‚Äôt as destructive as my ex‚Äôs. I am so happy for anyone who has a good relationship whether they have bipolar or not. Relationships are hard. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing when two people love each other and treat each other with the utmost respect and kindness. It‚Äôs rare and it ought to be celebrated. 

Whereas you and your partner have a healthy relationship, this is the exception for people with bipolar, not the rule. You are not a statistic, you‚Äôre an individual and you‚Äôre very unique. 

I dislike bipolar but I don‚Äôt dislike people with bipolar. I take exception to the suggestion that anyone with bipolar who behaves badly has another underlying pathology, such as narcissism, that makes them abusive. Some people with BP have comorbid psychopathologies, but many of them do all kinds of destructive things to themselves and others as a direct result of the condition.

I‚Äôm not personally offended at what you have said, but I think what you‚Äôve said, speaking only from your experience is a very narrow viewpoint that lacks inclusivity. It has some merit but it‚Äôs also invalidating to many who have bipolar and the people who live with them and love them. 

There are so many things you say that I wholeheartedly agree with, but to draw conclusions and make assumptions on the intentions and experiences of other BP sufferers isn‚Äôt right. You don‚Äôt know them, their values, their premorbid personalities or the trajectory of their illness. Bipolar is extremely complex, but functionally it creates problems and problematic symptoms or it wouldn‚Äôt be considered a disorder. 

Please know that I see your heart is good and I believe you when you speak of your experiences as someone who has bipolar. Much love to you and your partner, OP x"
BipolarSOs,fn1l4lq,t3_fykqrq,1586564334.0,"Bipolar affects everyone differently. Don‚Äôt break off your relationship because of other people‚Äôs experiences. If bipolar causes problems in your relationship, try to get help and work through them. Communicate your fears to your partner and keep communicating always. Don‚Äôt make unilateral decisions to protect your partner. If you guys want to break up, it should probably be a discussion where you both get to talk about what you want. There‚Äôs nothing worse than having someone make what they think is the best decision for you. My BP ex would make decisions that she thought were best for both of us but they honestly hurt me greatly. She felt so justified though so whereas she said she cared about my feelings and still loved me, she didn‚Äôt act like it at all. My ex with BP was loving, supportive and non-abusive, but she got more and more unwell as time went on and she became verbally and emotionally abusive. She was also always cutting and plotting her suicide. I don‚Äôt take that personally, but it made me so afraid to sleep because she would do it while I slept. I‚Äôve had insomnia for almost 6 years now as a result of her incessant desire to kill herself. That traumatised the fuck out of me and I ended up with PTSD. It‚Äôs made it impossible for me to have relationships now so I just accept it‚Äôs likely I won‚Äôt ever be able to be in a relationship again, despite therapy. I‚Äôm doing so well these days but it‚Äôs taken way too many years to get to this point. 

If you have have underlying trauma, please get therapy now. If you don‚Äôt, bipolar and trauma is a powerfully bad combination that ends of destroying everyone else around them if left untreated. 

And also most relationships don‚Äôt work out, but that‚Äôs not a reason to not try. You won‚Äôt know unless you try. 

If you‚Äôre stable, insightful and accepting of your condition, and you‚Äôre not abusive, then why break up? If the relationship doesn‚Äôt work out, it might not be because you have bipolar. Most relationships end in breakups but not due to bipolar.

All the best to you and your partner x"

It was the worst time in my life. I‚Äôm super afraid of relationships now so I just avoid them like the plague. The upshot is that my life is back on track and I don‚Äôt have to live with someone who was so unwell that they psychologically destroyed me.

From how she said they acted, she was definitely freaking even religious people out. Delusions are at another level of intensity. It‚Äôs just like paranoia - we can all be a little paranoid sometimes but we can still reign it in. People who have paranoid delusions will think there is a government conspiracy against them or that their neighbour that they don‚Äôt know and have never properly spoken to is plotting to kill them in their sleep and that they will change the locks if they go to the shops so they can kill them some night. You can ask them questions and they will have an answer for everything even though it‚Äôs so bonkers and doesn‚Äôt make sense to anyone else."
BipolarSOs,fldbum4,t1_fldazdl,1585061269.0,"That‚Äôs a rational way to think about this situation. And no, just because she helped you, you don‚Äôt actually owe her anything. I understand that you feel like you owe her, but she never had to put her mental health at risk to help you. You were depressed but I‚Äôm guessing you were still of sound mind. You are risking your mental health when you deal with someone you love who has lost their firm grip on reality. Bipolar is very different than depression. It makes depression look preferable. If you are susceptible to depression, being there for your friend will likely begin to send you back into depression. I know it‚Äôs hard to have boundaries with someone who isn‚Äôt in their right mind, but you‚Äôd be surprised how they can stick to some rules such as completely ghosting you and not accidentally messaging you even if they‚Äôre manic. Just stick to the broken record approach and keep asserting the same boundary. Be prepared to walk away or end a conversation if she persists. She will figure it out even if she‚Äôs very, very unwell. It‚Äôs tricky though. Don‚Äôt let your heart keep getting smooshed by her."
BipolarSOs,fldb1qo,t1_fld0q97,1585060765.0,"Definitely your friend is delusional. People with bipolar aren‚Äôt necessarily religious, nor do they necessarily have religious delusions, but when they are delusional they feel as though everything suddenly makes sense. That everything is connected and that everything is a sign or has a special meaning. 

I always say; there‚Äôs only two groups of people who are very sure about anything: those who are very religious, and those who are suffering with a psychosis. The rest of us are confused. Just like you‚Äôre confused right now about so many things as you‚Äôve indicated in your message above and your post. It‚Äôs normal to be confused by people and life. 

A lot of people who experience mania feel as though they are having a ‚Äúspiritual experience‚Äù. It‚Äôs super common. They‚Äôre not confused, the world has just opened up to them and god is sending them signs. They feel great. People who have a psychosis will often make connections between the strangest things, they will read into things people say as though they are supposed to be receiving a secret code, and they think everything is somehow synchronised. It can be very frustrating and super strange to witness. They are also highly suggestible so be very careful what you say to her. For example, if you said that you met someone who was related to someone famous, then later they might think that story was about them - that they‚Äôre related to the famous person. If you explained to her the direct kinds of delusions people with bipolar can have, she might suddenly start experiencing the exact possible delusions you mentioned."
BipolarSOs,fld9bad,t1_fld0gd3,1585059653.0,"I‚Äôm glad what I said didn‚Äôt come across as too harsh toward your friend. I just want to be sure you‚Äôre ok too. You‚Äôre important as well. Your mental health is no less significant that your friend‚Äôs. It‚Äôs important to have good boundaries. You don‚Äôt have to go along with the soulmate thing. You can say to her that it‚Äôs insensitive for her to talk to you about those things given your history together. Definitely draw a line in the sand there.

Your friend is severely lacking in insight into having bipolar at the moment and because she is manic her judgment is severely impaired. She‚Äôs more vulnerable in this state and she‚Äôs more likely to make a lot of decisions she will later have to pay for, both literally and figuratively. But, whereas life isn‚Äôt fair, this is her disorder, not yours. Because you are close to her and you‚Äôre of sound mind, you might be more affected by her bipolar than she is. She is living in a dream-like state at the moment where she believes she is loved by her soul mate and that god is communicating with her. She‚Äôs probably doing ok at the moment. She‚Äôs not wanting to hurt herself or anyone else (thank goodness) so she‚Äôs kind of doing ok even if she‚Äôs suffering from a delusional psychosis at the moment. You, someone who loves her and can see her situation clearly, isn‚Äôt doing so well. Your heart is breaking for her but she‚Äôs blissfully ignorant right now. She may or may not gain insight as time goes on. Many people do because these manic states don‚Äôt last. 

It is so, so important that you handball some of the worry and concern you have for your friend to her family or professional supports. They can deal with some of the craziness of what is happening to your friend right now. Don‚Äôt let your love for her send you down the path of becoming a rescuer. Rescuers create victims at best or hateful persecutors at worst. Neither are good or healthy. 

Love your friend but know that this is not something she will be cured of and that her condition will get worse as time goes on. It‚Äôs ok to grieve the loss of the friend you once had if you only ever get to see glimpses of her former self again. Bipolar is shit. I wish there was a cure. My ex had bipolar and I think we would have had a pretty good relationship if bipolar didn‚Äôt take her over. She‚Äôs no longer the same person I met. She‚Äôs ultra religious these days (she used to have paranoid delusions, then they stared taking on a religious tone, but still with paranoia and now I think she‚Äôs completely controlled by the religious delusions) and we were friends for a year after we broke up but then apparently god told her she couldn‚Äôt be friends with me anymore because we had a lesbian relationship. She said god would heal her bipolar if she got rid of me from her life. I was someone she trusted and relied on for many things. I had sacrificed everything you can possibly imagine for her but suddenly I was discarded because her religious delusions are so very strong. I‚Äôm an atheist and I‚Äôm gay so I don‚Äôt care for anyone discarding me because I‚Äôm gay. Just know that bipolar is a very strong force. It will bulldoze over the top of all your good intentions and love. It has the power to turn your friend against you. The closer you are, the more damage you will likely suffer. 

Just remember, you are important too. Don‚Äôt trade your good mental health for anyone else‚Äôs poor mental health, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much you love them. You deserve love as well, especially to feel love toward yourself. You are worthwhile whether you‚Äôre helping your friend or asserting boundaries or taking care of yourself. You don‚Äôt exist to serve others or make them happy. We do our best to help our loved ones for sure, but check in with yourself and see if you‚Äôre really ok or if your mental health is slipping a bit throughout all of this. Implement more boundaries to protect yourself at any point. I don‚Äôt want you to go through even a tiny portion of what I‚Äôve been through. No one is worth that cost, plus they can just discard you whenever it suits them, so don‚Äôt sacrifice yourself for someone who might just shit on you in return. 

At the end of the day, read my comments and the others and do whatever feels right to you. We are cautionary tales here so we might frighten you a bit with our comments or advice. But at the end of the day, you have to live with the decisions you make, so only make decisions that are sustainable and that you can live with. Much love to you x"
BipolarSOs,flcu8v7,t3_fnx13n,1585046802.0,"There‚Äôs not much more you can do than what you‚Äôre already doing by being a good friend who is willing to help her no matter what. Don‚Äôt worry too much about the dating thing. They broke up and your friend will probably remember parts of this episode when she‚Äôs in a more stable frame of mind. She‚Äôll see for herself she was manic at the time. It will certainly be a learning experience for her. 

There‚Äôs nothing you can do when they‚Äôre crapping on about god and other delusional things. Just keep yourself psychologically safe in all of this. Her mental health isn‚Äôt more important than your own. Almost all of us here have made the mistake of seeing our loved one with BP very unwell and we‚Äôve put their needs above our own to the point where it has a devastating impact on our own health and wellbeing. Just remember you‚Äôre one of a bunch of supports. You‚Äôre not responsible for all the strange things your friend will inevitably continue to do. 

Just love her and tell her what your concerns and boundaries are. She will defy you and think she‚Äôs having a spiritual experience that you just don‚Äôt understand. Everything will make sense to her when she‚Äôs manic and she may get very angry with you if she thinks you‚Äôre trying to stand in her way. My advice? Always put your own oxygen mask on first and remember you‚Äôre not responsible for her actions."

BipolarSOs,flcpzbq,t3_fnz6hq,1585041410.0,"It‚Äôs really difficult being in a relationship with someone who has bipolar, isn‚Äôt it? I, and most others here, can relate to loving someone with bipolar but never really feeling we‚Äôre in a relationship with a responsible adult. The relationships are usually tumultuous and full of problems. So stressful. The stress changes us. It changes everything. Our bodies get used to being in a constant state of stress. It‚Äôs really hard to go back to the person you were prior to meeting your BP partner. I‚Äôve never been the same since. I‚Äôm doing really well these days but some parts of me will always be broken now. I broke up with my ex over 5 years ago and whereas, for me, the love did eventually wear off (it‚Äôs not a switch anyone can just flick on or off) when I gained a different perspective of everything (eg reading the experience of others on this sub, learning more, coming to terms with how I was treated by someone who was supposed to love me, going to therapy, eventually opening up to my family about how bad the relationship was for me years later when I got to breaking point with my mental health, etc) she put me through and the damage that did to my mental health, I never thought I could stop loving her. After all, we didn‚Äôt break up because we lost love for each other. 

Relationships are difficult and complicated at the best of times, and having a partner with BP certainly adds a lot of abuse and pain for us as the SOs who are never quite good enough despite making significant sacrifices and somehow being constantly magnanimous. 

It‚Äôs too simplistic for outsiders looking in to say you should make different decisions - insinuating that you should perhaps leave her. It‚Äôs very hard to leave someone you love, who you‚Äôve been with for such a long time even if you know it‚Äôs not a healthy or happy relationship. We always hope that medication or therapy or time or something will return our loved one back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô - back to the person we first fell in love with. Sadly, most of us come to the conclusion that this isn‚Äôt something that can be cured. They‚Äôre always going to have bipolar and it‚Äôs always going to break our hearts and spirits. 

It‚Äôs so hard to give advice in these situations so I‚Äôll refrain from doing so. I just wanted to validate you and what you‚Äôve been experiencing all these years. It‚Äôs ok to vent and to feel as you do. Life is hard but we‚Äôre here for you if you ever need us. Much love to you x"

ptsd,fjmqi8z,t3_fe7y1w,1583479540.0,"Yes, in fact this is a common way to deal with trauma. In chapter 2 of the book ‚ÄòThe Body Keeps the Score‚Äô, author Bessel Van Der Kolk says the following: ‚Äú‚Äùstrong emotions can block pain‚Äù was the result of the release of morphinelike substances manufactured in the brain. This suggested that for many traumatized people, reexposure to stress might provide a similar relief from anxiety.‚Äù

He talks about how our body chemistry changes as a result of our adrenals responding to trauma over long periods of time and how we can start to experience what is essentially a withdrawal syndrome. It explains why some people will punish themselves by going to the gym until they become elated after they push through the pain, or why others self-harm. Psychological pain releases endorphins to help us mange, but so does physical pain. What once brought us pain can almost become the antidote to pain, beginning a weird addiction-like cycle. 

It‚Äôs a very enlightening book that I highly recommend in small doses. It‚Äôs very validating because we can relate to it, so it can be a bit too much at times, but it‚Äôs a fantastic book. He explains it all better than me."

ptsd,fjcmod3,t1_fjb9kvz,1583226903.0,"Hey, thanks for sharing more information with me to help me better understand what you‚Äôve been going through. Having autism definitely makes you more vulnerable as you said, and it will likely make you fixate on all the things you‚Äôd rather forget. It can also make developing friendships harder. My father and other family members have autism, and whereas I used to have a lot of classically autistic behaviours and traits as a child/teen, I‚Äôve got much better at fitting in, much less anxious and I‚Äôm a lot better at not fixating on things that distress me - I still struggle sometimes though. I‚Äôm also a terrible liar and I hate lies so I just always tell the truth :) It works best for me and then I don‚Äôt have to feel guilty. People used to make me feel stupid for being naive or gullible, until I realised that I shouldn‚Äôt feel stupid for being gullible; they should feel bad for trying to deceive me. I‚Äôm still a bit naive with something and not very naive in many other ways. Life eventually removes all of our innocence and naivety. 

I don‚Äôt want you ever to feel shame about who you are. As you learn more you‚Äôll probably feel angrier with this friend of yours who took advantage of you. You‚Äôll begin to see him for what he really is. You are already beginning to see it, but there‚Äôs still more to him. 

I think it‚Äôs good to make a distinction between someone who is friendly and someone who is your friend. Anyone can be friendly: it might be because they work in hospitality and need to greet customers in a friendly manner, or it could be because they‚Äôre trying to deceive you. There‚Äôs so many reasons why people act friendly. Some are good reasons and some are very bad. 

A friend is someone who genuinely cares for you. They see your vulnerabilities and they want to protect you or help you, not exploit you or tell you to lie to your professional supports like your psychiatrist. This guy was not your friend. He was actually a predator. He said things to you to keep you dependent on him. He was a deceiver. 

Take good care of your body. We only get one! It‚Äôs important to find healthier ways of coping than eating. Eating might help in the short-term to squash how you‚Äôre feeling, but it‚Äôs not sustainable and it will make you very sick. No matter what your body shape is, there are people who will prey on you. Sometimes people feel safer if they think they look less attractive to guys, but it doesn‚Äôt actually make them safer. Learning about predators, learning about what real friends are, learning what healthy boundaries are, learning about mental health and good nutrition are all things that will keep your safer, happier and healthier. But just know that if someone victimises us, it‚Äôs not our fault. It‚Äôs the fault of the perpetrator. 

Don‚Äôt be sorry about anything. You‚Äôve done nothing wrong. I might be a stranger on the other side of the world but I do actually care about you. Everyone here who has upvoted or commented cares about you. You have intrinsic worth. You might not see it or feel it yet, but you‚Äôre very important and worthwhile. There will be people in your life who suck, that‚Äôs the same for all of us, but there will also be wonderful, lovely humans how love you for who you are. There are good people in this world. You are one of them :)"

ptsd,fj9nf9b,t3_fc26ks,1583154488.0,"You are so brave to share your feelings with us. You honestly haven‚Äôt done anything wrong. It‚Äôs like you said; he was grooming you and he did the wrong thing. For now, your body might be a reminder of that bad guy and how he tricked you. Those bad associations will fade over time. 

Be kind to yourself and treat your body with heaps of respect such as showering, wearing your nice clothes and brushing your hair. If you are kind to yourself, you start to weaken the association between the feelings of shame you described. I‚Äôm so sad to hear you feel so much shame about all this and especially your body. He‚Äôs the one who should feel ashamed. You don‚Äôt have to tell anyone about what happened ever if you don‚Äôt want to. 

As you get older you might want to tell trusted friends and therapists. Once you‚Äôre old enough, therapists will no longer have mandatory reporting obligations to your parents or police. But please do consider telling a therapist at school or your parent if you ever feel like hurting yourself or ending your life. That‚Äôs when you need to do whatever you can to get help. You can totally heal from all of this and not be plagued by all the bad memories constantly. 

If you find your head getting caught up with things you‚Äôd rather forget, then look around your room and name 10 things you can see. You could also try to remember the names of 10 girls you know from school. Sometimes doing things like this helps retrain our brains from thinking over and over again about the horrible memories. 

Remember you are brave and awesome. You have done nothing wrong at all. Also remember that this is the worst you‚Äôll feel about all of this. Little by little, as each day goes on, you‚Äôll feel a tiny bit more detached from these painful feelings and happier feelings will take their place. Hang in there, young friend! You‚Äôve got this!"

BipolarSOs,fj63efs,t1_fj5ty3q,1583054717.0,"Probably not. Ghosting is absolutely brutal. When we‚Äôre ghosted we‚Äôre just left with all the old memories on repeat. The memories are like torturing ourselves to see if there were opportunities we missed when we could have done or said something differently so that we‚Äôd still be together. We end up thinking we were the ones who could have made things work if we were more careful. Thankfully you have a list you can refer back to whenever you feel tempted to think you should have been more tolerant or whatever it is that pops into your head that puts all the blame on you. Ghosting is so cruel. It‚Äôs like a metaphor for death. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôve become dead to the person who ghosts us who just gets on with their life. We feel like we must be the worst person in their life if they so thoroughly have to cut us off. We feel like we‚Äôre the devil. They don‚Äôt cut other assholes off but they cut us off. 

Know this: ghosting is a lack of maturity. It‚Äôs simple to do and it‚Äôs cold and cowardly. I was friends with my BP ex for a year after we broke up. It was hard because she was so unwell and would constantly encroach on my time at work and home. I felt tormented but eventually we got to a place where she was ok to me. Then she said she no longer needed me and that god had told her to delete me from her life. So she did. I‚Äôve had a few small interactions via email over the past 4+ years since she ghosted me but she was very grandiose and would put me down so they weren‚Äôt nice interactions. The whole relationship with her turned into a nightmare, being friends with her at a distance was manageable, but being ghosted by her was even worse than our inevitable relationship breakup. It was the ultimate rejection. Like my usefulness had expired. Like I didn‚Äôt matter anymore. Like I was dead to her.

I have PTSD from our relationship and her ghosting me just made my recovery so much worse. I think that having a casual friendship (we live on other sides of the planet) that was kind and with good boundaries would have helped me heal. I got ghosted instead. There are plenty of things she‚Äôs done in her life on a whim, when she‚Äôs been unwell that she‚Äôs regretted but ghosting me was not one of them. She never reneged. So I had to make my own closure. I had to remind myself that this shit happens to people like me constantly so why shouldn‚Äôt it happen to me too? After all, [I‚Äôm not more special than anyone else](https://youtu.be/NWH8N-BvhAw). I had to focus on my friends, family and job and keep pushing forward. It‚Äôs literally taken me years to get to the good mental place I‚Äôm in now. I‚Äôve had to ask myself a lot of questions and I‚Äôve had to remind myself how cruel she was to me and how one sided the relationship was (I have all the old emails and I‚Äôm shocked to see the shit I put up with from her). 

A week and a half ago it was my birthday. That evening I received an email from her. It was the first time she‚Äôd initiated contacted since she told me god wanted her to erase me from her life for good. Here‚Äôs a copy of the email with names redacted: 


Hello syberburns,

Hope you have had a happy birthday and that you have a good 2020 üôÇ

There is something I'd like to discuss with you when I'm next in ___________. I'm likely to be there for some time as I am also going to ___________. I don't have dates yet, so not sure exactly when that will be but maybe we could Skype or talk on the phone in case e-mail allows for unfortunate ambiguity.

Take care,
BP ex

I promptly blocked her from my email and didn‚Äôt respond. After 4+ years I‚Äôm actually doing ok now and I‚Äôm fiercely protective of my mental health. There is nothing I would do to jeopardise it again and having contact with her certainly has the potential to upset my mental health. She‚Äôs a PTSD trigger for me and she has no empathy for me. I‚Äôm at a point now where there is no scenario where I would need to have contact with her. There‚Äôs zero in it for me. I don‚Äôt need an apology. I don‚Äôt need to know she‚Äôs better or worse (she has a supportive family and friends). I don‚Äôt need to know she‚Äôs moved on. I don‚Äôt need to know about her future aspirations. I actually like my life better now without her in it.

The truth is, the person who fucked with your head to begin with, cannot be the person to give you closure or validation. These things will come in time. Therapy helps too as do supportive, friends, family and Internet forums like this. PM me anytime. I live on the other side of the planet but if you give me time, I‚Äôll eventually respond always :) You‚Äôre not alone x"

It is strange that the parents weren‚Äôt more concerned. Perhaps the parents knew something was going on but they weren‚Äôt ready to admit their child was being abused by someone they knew? Many parents will turn a blind eye to their children being sexually abused. Perhaps the OP‚Äôs parents were incredibly naive about life? I sincerely hope so. 

Observing a small child sexually stimulating themselves in public and expressing that they are aroused by thoughts of death and physical punishment are very overt signs that sexual abuse is occurring. These aren‚Äôt normal behaviours for little children."

exmormon,fipco2b,t3_f8w6d4,1582603325.0,"Tell him that no matter what he chooses that he not only has you, he has all of us. We have a shared history of Mormonism. We love him unconditionally and we are all here as living testaments that there is life after Mormonism if he chooses to leave the church, and that there is a good life for him if he wants to remain in the church even if he comes home from his mission early. The church and it‚Äôs people can try to shame and ostracise him, but they cannot take away his worth. If anyone treats him badly then they are not true disciples of Christ. Trying to guilt or shame your brother is abusive and it is not ok.

I‚Äôm now and atheist, but if there is a god, he will love your brother for the good quality human he is, not whether or not he served a mission. None of the current first presidency went on missions. 

Tell your brother we love him and we will stand by him whether he stays on his mission, comes home early, remains in the church or leaves it for good. 

We are all in this life together and we will do whatever it takes to get him well and happy again. 

There is freedom, love and true joy to be had even when breaking away from religion. I have never felt freer to love everyone as I do now and now that I know I only have one life, it‚Äôs given me a better perspective of how to live my life and not to turn a blind eye to human suffering. 

Tell your brother that if something really doesn‚Äôt feel right to him, it‚Äôs probably because there‚Äôs something very wrong with the situation. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with how he‚Äôs feeling or who he is. His emotions are trying to communicate something to him. 

The bravest thing any of us can do is to have the courage to live our lives our way. Not for our parents, not for society. 

For now, tell him he needs to focus on getting well and knowing he‚Äôs not alone. He has you and he has thousands of us. 

Much love to you and your brother xo"

We can encourage him to do the healthy thing, but he can still decide what‚Äôs the best call for him. I‚Äôm not sure that there‚Äôs any group of people who wouldn‚Äôt consider the negative repercussions of seeking professional support. Stigma is born out of ignorance and the erroneous belief that some people are immune to mental health problems. Sometimes we just have to put our head down and learn to do what‚Äôs best for us. Considering too much what others will think isn‚Äôt always a good idea because it can be paralysing. Like I said, people can always see a psychologist without telling their workmates or anyone else. No one should feel like their private matters should be made public. I understand where you‚Äôre coming from (I‚Äôm currently a civilian contractor psychologist who works with serving military personnel), but I think mentioning any possible barrier to getting treatment at this stage isn‚Äôt productive for the OP.
