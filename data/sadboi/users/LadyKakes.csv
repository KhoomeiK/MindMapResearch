CoronavirusUS,fou6qr4,t3_g9gxmj,1588077642.0,I work at a long term care facility in Indiana and we have been on lockdown for almost 2 months as well. We set up a Skype account and mounted a big TV to a rolling tray so we can wheel it into residents rooms for video chats with their family. It’s been a huge relief for not only the residents but the families as well. I would contact the facility your family member is at and see if that would be an option.

medizzy,feapkod,t3_eoa3jl,1578951097.0,I had this same surgery done in July 2019. Appendiceal mucinous adencarcinoma diagnoses following surgery. Original surgery was to remove appendix that had prolapsed through the colon due to weight of a tumor. It’s cool to be able to see what it looks like!
TooAfraidToAsk,feanpiq,t3_eo7jn7,1578950645.0,My Marine ex-husband cheated on me within the the first week of our marriage. We were elementary school sweethearts and he was the one who pushed for marriage. I think there is a lot more cheating going on within the bases but it’s easier to point the fingers on the spouses on the outside.

antiMLM,f1ppdoe,t3_dafmf2,1569685742.0,This just happened to me two weeks ago. I was diagnosed with cancer 5 weeks ago right after my 30th birthday. A “hun” from my home town called me and thought since I had to close my Salon due to the diagnosis that it would be a perfect time for me to start selling R&F. Needless to say I don’t think she’ll ever ask anyone going through cancer again and she’ll sure as hell never bring it up to me again. Sending prayers your Mother-in-Laws way! She’s got this!

After that the growth rate was so much that he just chopped it down before the frost freeze. It will still produce a few leaves after that but they kind of wilt and cover the roots “winterizing” itself
