selfharm,fk2bvth,t3_fftl3h,1583797570.0,"Hi. 39/F self harming via cutting since 12, other forms earlier than that. I know you’re seeking responses from a very different demographic but in the off chance this will help someone helping teens, I’m giving you what I’ve got. 


(1) Do you think self-harm is fine? Why or why not? 

No. It’s not fine. It’s fucking horrible. This, however, depends on your definition of self-harm. For the purposes of this response, I’m using anything that is performed autonomously and purposely harms ones body. Example: I engaged in a fight with someone and they hit me. Dangerous and reckless behavior to be sure, but not self-harm. There are nuances to this of course that I can’t even get into. I’m still working on that with my therapist (‘did I try to get raped so I could be punished for the worthless piece of shit I am?’) 


(2) What has been the turning point at which you thought to yourself “I can’t be doing this anymore”? I.e. what made you want to stop? 

Nothing but vanity. This didn’t happen until my 30s, so again not too helpful for you. I dress modestly but colleagues and clients can still see and comment on visible scars even if they’re nearly 30 years old. 


(3) What is the worst thing about self-harm

I have an eating disorder whose timeline coincides with the self-harm. The worst thing about purging is that it’ll kill me. The worst thing about self-harm is, well, it can kill me if I have said intention but honestly, feeling like I’m still fucking 13 in my bedroom at my parents house and nothing has changed. I’m still the same piece of shit who shouldn’t be alive and can’t properly deal with life."
