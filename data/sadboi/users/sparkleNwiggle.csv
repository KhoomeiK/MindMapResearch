AskReddit,fqprm9o,t3_gk9635,1589552673.0,"I’ve watched these two sisters grow up over the last 8 years and it is still going on a little bit. I met them when they were 8 and 7 years old. The Oldest would get in the front seat every time and never let the Youngest sit there. Oldest would grab Youngest by the hair and slam her head into objects, the ground, the wall, whatever was closest. Essentially, Oldest was a bully. And the parents and grandparents don’t do anything. They laugh when Oldest hurts Youngest and everything that Oldest wants to do sports wise, the Youngest also has to do even though they have completely different personalities because it’s too much trouble for them to do separate things. The Oldest was favored so bad the Youngest lost weight. At 10 years old, the Youngest weighed less than 50 lbs, couldn’t eat, too scared to go to school and her parents and grandparents just laughed at her. 
I got so angry after I was watching the girls when Oldest slammed Youngest’s head into my car console, causing a huge gash across the side of her head that I told the parents (I was 17 at the time) that if they didn’t start paying attention to Youngest and keeping Oldest from beating the shit out of Youngest, that in a few years Youngest wouldn’t be around because she’d a) kill herself b) be killed by Oldest c) taken away because of a phone call made by me. The Dad’s eyes opened to all the violence that Youngest had gone through after Oldest repeatedly hit her one night. He called me and apologized but I told him it wasn’t me that he needed to say sorry to.
I am happy to report that Youngest started her first year of middle school, her sister being at a different campus, and is a completely different person. She’s gained about 20lbs, still small, but has a group of her own friends. She’s into theater and ballet, loves school, and hasn’t been hit by her sister since I called the night the Dad saw the hitting. The grandparents still favor Oldest, but it’s become more equal by the parents."

Aquariums,foybgll,t3_ga9mlc,1588169410.0,"You’ve done your research, that’s for sure. The only thing that I think you’re not very clear is cycling the tank before you put the fish into the new tank. You want bacteria to colonize the tank filter and decorations to help get rid of fish waste. It usually takes a four to six weeks to get that good bacteria built up.  The great thing about already having a tank setup is that you’ve already got good bacteria.
Set everything up for your new tank. Take the filter media from the old tank and stick it in the new filter and keep your eyes on the water quality. 
If your taking everything out of the old to put into the new tank, makes to put your plants, decor, and filters media into the water from your old tank. This will keep your bacteria alive. 

As for your fish eating: if you have any minced garlic, soak their food in the garlic juice and then give it to them. Garlic stimulates a feeding response in most fish. If they don’t take it, I don’t know what more you could do."

ReefTank,fouhlc8,t3_g8uvfl,1588084210.0,"I’m fairly new too! I’ve two clowns in a 10 gallon and they seem content, but only those two fish.  I fully intend to upgrade into a 20 gal in the near future. I wanted to get into saltwater and learn how to deal with mixing water, water changes, and evaporation because it was confusing when to add freshwater and when to add saltwater. I wanted to start with something small before I got something I couldn’t handle. And a 10 gal budget build is perfect for first timers who have had freshwater experience.  And it’s so much cheaper when starting out to just learn, because you will make mistakes. I recommend look at Inappropriate Reefer’s 10 gallon Budget Build.
What I’ve learned in the four months of keep a saltwater tank:
1) get an ATO. An Auto Top Off will keep your salinity stable as it adds freshwater into the system. When saltwater evaporates, it leaves behind the salt which is why your salinity goes up as there is less water and more salt. The ATO adds freshwater to keep that balance of salt and water. If you added saltwater in the place of the freshwater, you would just be adding in more salt and increasing the salinity (seems basic enough but trying to explain it to my brother who’s doing research for his own tank is disheartening).
2) use an aquaclear 70 as filtration AND flow. It’s keeps from having to use wave makers that take up room and does the same job because the tank is so small. 
3) your tank will go through an ugly faze, just like algae blooms on new freshwater tanks. Just let it do it’s thing.
4) at minimum, use RO water (reverse osmosis) for adding to the tank and mixing salt, but make sure to dechlorinate it.  DI units can always be added to the RO system later if you can’t afford both. 
5) use dry rock and don’t buy rock from your local fish store. It gets expensive real quick. 12 lbs of dry rock was $76. Shop around online for deals. Though the dry rock makes you have to cycle the tank yourself (or buy bottled bacteria) and wait a bit before you can stock, it also eliminates any chance of introducing a pest into your new tank that you won’t know how to deal with.
6) zoanthids are perfect for every level of Reefer. They can release a toxin, but if you wear gloves and eye protection, you’ll be perfectly safe. A lot of blogs and YouTubers scare beginners away from this coral because of the toxin, but they are honestly so easy to deal with and so beautiful! I have three frags!
7) set a limit on how much you’ll pay for a frag! I will not pay more than $25 for any, no matter what, because I just can’t afford it. You can easily spend hundreds of dollars on frags.
8) check around you state or country to see if there are any local reefing sites you can join. They offer advice, will answer questions, and best of all, THEY GIVE YOU FRAGS FOR FREE! When they have to frag some of there larger coral, they’ll give you frags as a way to not only help you, but let them have a back up of that coral if their tank happens to crash.

This is what I feel is the most important info I’ve learned so far. I’m happy to share! And you won’t need a skimmer on a 10 gal because scheduled water changes will take care of any proteins in the water released by corals."

Once you’ve learned all that, then comes acceptance and dealing with it. It’s got to get ugly before it gets pretty. And it will take time.

Guitar,fm5o540,t3_ft8zir,1585776645.0,"Youtube is a great resource for new guitarists! Look at JustinGuitar, Marty Schwartz, or Mahalo. You can even google “guitar basics” and it’ll bring up some good places to start. My advice is to learn three chords G, C, and D and just switch between those chords in a simple strumming pattern. Most songs use GCD, so those are three good ones to start with."

ReefTank,fm4rlg6,t3_fsm999,1585759517.0,Mine aren’t even on a frag plug. My LFS gave me a few polyps attached to an empty shell. They’ve just about taken the over the entire shell.

AskReddit,fm452gy,t3_fszch0,1585746699.0,"Being a fraud and not belonging. We had a program my last year of college that was in the STEM field and it was designed for upper classes to help lower classes in whatever they needed. The best discussion we had, which included the professors over the program, was about feeling like a fraud and feeling like you didn’t belong. It was life changing to hear professors feel admit they had these feelings too. I remember one professor saying the moment she stepped on campus for her first year of teaching, she was convinced that someone would figure out she wasn’t smart enough to be a professor and fire her. 
This discussion was the best one we had because it made us connect over the feeling of being an imposter."
Advice,fm2hdub,t3_fsnpsm,1585697515.0,"I’m sorry for what happened when you were young and I hate you’re having to go through this. It’s not a fix-all solution, but do you have something you’ve always wanted to try? Like learning a new instrument or something that really interests you ( I’m trying to think of stuff you can do inside and away from large congregations of people due to the virus). What I’m trying to say is to focus on yourself. Take up cooking or baking, something that makes you excited. Adopt a pet or get an aquarium, something that takes up your time so you have no time to think of her and your relationship. My cat and my aquariums are the only reason I didn’t commit suicide a few years ago. If you can, maybe reach out to a therapist or a counseling app( a more budget friendly option)."

ReefTank,fm2eppz,t1_fm1wmud,1585696000.0,"Thank you! I appreciate the way you phrased that. And I definitely will keep an eye on Frank. If he looks bad, I’ll brave the long trek to my LFS and take him back to make sure he has the best shot."
ReefTank,fm1vrx1,t1_fm1dh6j,1585685892.0,"A couple of months old. 3 months almost 4 (I haven’t really kept track) I have a Zasta Zoa, Xenia (isolated on its own rock), and a Green Acan. All are healthy and open. Water parameters are ammonia 0, nitrate 0, nitrite 0."

Advice,flqxnva,t3_fql7zi,1585408603.0,"If you’re able, change your number. Leave all groups where these people are, shut down any profiles with your username (YouTube channels, gaming profiles, discord) and set up new ones under a different name. Under no circumstances are you to contact anyone out of that “friend” group. If they were your friends, they wouldn’t have done what they did. This guy Jamale is targeting you, and sending Dominoes to your door is absolutely a reason to freak out. It could be just griefing, but Jamale’s intent could be even worse and I don’t want you find out what that intent could be. You can go to Dominoes and explain the situation and come up with a code word for them to know it’s really you ordering. If you have anymore questions or concerns, or just want some to talk to, feel free to private message me."
