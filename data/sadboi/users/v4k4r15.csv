What I’ve learned from therapy is that the only reward for sticking it out is the fact that you can change, the fact your life can become better one day. I know and fully understand how you feel I’ve been hospitalized twice for my suicide attempts and I wasn’t even hospitalized for my third one. Having had an abusive and rough childhood and living through it is one of the hardest things in life, screw a kick in the balls or giving birth, your emotional trauma is severe and I’m so proud of you for not only making it through it, but also managing to be clean from addictions (you may say that you started the addictions, but everyone has their way of coping)

The world may seem bleak, but there are people who can and want to help you, I’m not a professional by any means, but I’d be happy to talk to you and help you out in some way, having a close relative or family member who has been showing clear signs of a mental illness is absolutely heartbreaking, but that’s just life, yes it’s cruel, but you have to endure it, because it can only go up from here, trust me, if it goes down even more than that means it will go up twice as hard!

If you need anyone to talk to, or someone to remind you that it wasn’t your fault, or to help with BPD related issues, I’m here for you, I know it may not seem like much, but I’m here, I’ve lost way too many close friends to suicide and I just want to help. So if you want to I’m all free :)

I care about this communities every single individual and it’s sad to see so many people leave suicide notes here, so please if you still have a glimmer of hope in your heart, don’t give up! There are people who care for you, I understand that it might sound strange that a stranger over the internet is saying this, but don’t give up, I’m here for you"

Simply put, I do not understand and why so many of us chose to have relationships with other people even though there are possibilities that they will betray you, and even if not, why form them anyway? Is it an evolutionary instinct? Is it simply a human desire to be with others, just because were social animals?

Why do you need other people in life? Statistically you’re going to lose them and get “hurt” as most say, and if not, then the question arises “is it even worth the effort?” 

What feeling of pride or gratitude do you get from being with someone? What kind of emotional forces you to stay with someone, even if it adds 0 benefit??

I’m very happy I found this sub, that there are actual people who feel the same way I do, ever since I was 7 I never wanted to have kids because of a few simple reasons:

1) Financial burden - Kids are very expensive to take care of and the only benefit is a few hormones, drugs would be a cheaper substitute

2) My Genes - Being fat along with having a couple mental illnesses I feel as if it would be pure torture for my kids to live in this world with the same starting gear I had

3) The World and me - The world is a scary place and I have yet to discover a lot of it, but from what I’ve gathered it’s not so bright... And even if that were to change, I don’t think I would be emotionally capable to take care of a child, my depressive episodes and panic attacks would surely put a lot of strain on my hypothetical child,
so I’d rather them not suffer.
