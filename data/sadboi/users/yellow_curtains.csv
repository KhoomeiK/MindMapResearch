Anxiety,ey663zr,t3_cvoj4x,1566848279.0,"So I‚Äôm just gonna tell you my story real quick: I dropped out of school at 17 (just needed 2 more years till graduation, but I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore due to my mental health) I always felt sick and went home a hundred times. That was 4 years ago. I did smt like a sabbatical year, just to focus on myself and my health, had a lot of therapy sessions. Then I went back to school. It wasn‚Äôt easy, I still went home from class or didn‚Äôt even go to school many days, I cried a lot, I worked a lot on myself, for myself. But somehow I made it through and graduated with straight A‚Äôs. I‚Äôm now in university, I still have days I can‚Äôt leave my apartment. But it‚Äôs getting better, day by day. Hang on, you‚Äôre gonna make it too."
