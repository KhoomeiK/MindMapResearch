bipolar,fpvhq2s,t1_fpva5e3,1588945018.0,"Oh that's even better! I love stationary too, I think they say it's the ""illusion of productivity"" or something that can be a common draw haha I'm not sure but I like to make sure I have plenty to play with too!"
bipolar,fpv9rr3,t1_fpv9k0p,1588939464.0,Haha thank you! It's so much nicer taking my pills out of a container that I actually enjoy haha yeah it's just basic black on the original and I loved that but also I'm chaotic as hell and black and rainbows is kind of my aesthetic so stickerbombs felt right haha I just got the stickers off eBay I think it was like $8 for a pack of 50. Yay for buttfuck Australia! Hopefully you can ditch that granny container after all haha

This is mine: Rainbow Pillbox https://imgur.com/gallery/tGr9od8

And this is the original: https://portandpolishco.com/products/black-pillbox

I like it cause it looks nice and the mirror inside makes me feel like I can take it around in my backpack to use everyday. Way better than those bleh ones you get from pharmacies"
bipolar,fpv82ap,t1_fpv7qvq,1588938008.0,You wanna see mine? I can even link you to where I got it from before I sticker bombed it haha
bipolar,fpv7k2e,t1_fpv7b78,1588937551.0,"On a side note, another thing with medication that bothers me is how the usual pill cases look so bleh. I finally fixed that one recently, got a pill case from Port and polish and then added rainbow stickers. Taking pills is nicer when your box doesn't look like some old fogeys haha. I had so much trouble finding one that actually fit my medication and didn't look shitty!"
bipolar,fpv6wmw,t1_fpv6myi,1588936948.0,Yeah I think if I do it I'll use those little preserving jars with the screw lids. Fuck blister packs. I mean for lithium I kind of understand because it's such a risk for overdosing but antidepressants and other meds? I don't think there's any harm. Plus massive waste reduction. Those boxes of blister packs make so much fucking rubbish!
bipolar,fpuyl69,t3_gfm5jd,1588928356.0,I wish I got my pills in bottles. I get all of them in boxes with little sheets. It's so annoying having to pop them all out everytime I want to fill my week pill box. That's 77 pills. I think I'm gunna start keeping them in little glass airtight bottles to spare my fingers.

BipolarReddit,fmqu5f7,t3_fwnlx7,1586307119.0,"I don't drink alcohol or coffee because I find that it makes me hyperactive to the point of hypomania. I used to try drinking in them both in moderation but found it was just so much easier to not drink them at all. Mocktails have become my new best friend when I'm out socialising, and they look like alcohol so nobody ever bothers me about not drinking!"

bipolar,fmah5zw,t1_fmagm8b,1585893990.0,"To be honest, for a long time I was very similar, I was apathetic and wasn't even living, just surviving. It's only been recently in this facility that I've found a glimmer again. Felt like maybe instead of this disorder beating me I'm actually able to live with it. Or at least try. I hope you feel a little better soon, although I know with the way the world is right now it could be pretty difficult. If you ever want to chat my inbox is always open"

Now that my anxiety isn't breaking my balls I'm actually able to work on them again. It's a weird feeling."
bipolar,fkzx4i3,t1_fkzs6sg,1584683176.0,"This is more of a ""2020 has been fucking hell"" category than anything. I mean, I live in Australia, we almost lost the country to fires, and then floods, and now the world is having to cope with the corona virus, and shitty economy and a million other things. It's not cringe to be overwhelmed by shit going on in your country or the world is it?"

bipolar,fkq3efl,t1_fkq2m3v,1584428874.0,"The one that I'm going to is called Step Up Step Down (they have a couple of locations) and it's basically an in between of the hospital and of being out in the community. The one I'm in is 10 bed and they have a 28 day program (it's free - they even buy all your groceries) and you have your own locking room with an ensuite. There's a lot more freedom than a hospital, with them allowing phones and encouraging heading out for activities but have two compulsory therapy groups a day plus psychiatrists coming four days a week and clinical staff here every weekday until 4.30pm. There are Mind Australia staff here 24/7. I highly recommend it. I have a case manager who recommended me to them as beds go pretty quick but maybe go to their website and ask around? There are other places like this but they cost a lot of money (think $50k+) because they're private and this is public. In saying all this, if you need to go to the hospital they are very good too. We're very lucky here. Hope this helps!"
bipolar,fkpdift,t1_fkp9n8k,1584407541.0,Haha my mum died it black for me a few months ago. Why do mental breakdowns always seem to inspire hair colour changes?
bipolar,fkp4ewn,t1_fkopldq,1584401544.0,They did! And my phone too. This place has a lot more freedom than a hospital but a lot more responsibilities too. It's a good way to try and get everything back on track.

Still, I may have gotten lucky with the group I'm with. A lot of them have other mental illnesses along with the anxiety like PTSD, bipolar, ocd, schizophrenia etc. I hope if you are willing to try again one day that you can be with people who aren't so awful..."
bipolar,fhx062k,t1_fhwzazl,1581939191.0,That's amazing. My girl (the one drawn in the picture) is the same. Knows when I'm upset and comforts me for hours. I have another girl (we always call her my husband's haha) but she's a little more needing comfort rather than giving lol

I have a psychiatrist but he has been away for three months, so I've been trying to cope on my own. I do enjoy boxing, I have wraps for my knuckles but I still have a tendency to bruise them severely so I try to do other things to settle me down I'm participating in an anxiety group though which is a first, hopefully I'll get some results from there"

There's definitley something reassuring knowing that everything will change and pass. I've booked my appointment with my psychiatrist and am bracing for the changes he'll make, but I know it will be for the better, even if it takes a little while. Also thank you, I don't feel very beautiful right now but I decided I would share myself with you guys in my most honest form."

bipolar,fc6wrt5,t1_fc6tyel,1577491495.0,"To be honest I didn't even know this was a thing until I started research into types of bipolar. I understand your apprehension but like you said, to those who have it it would be very real and very serious. Anything that alters your moods is awful. Life definitley has its ups and downs but I think cyclothymia must have more severe changes to make it classify as a type of bipolar."

bipolar2,fbiuwws,t1_fbirl7u,1576915470.0,I'm sorry you're feeling that way. I've had those moments of blah too and they're terrible. My depressive episodes last upwards of two weeks. The longest was around 8 months but usually I'd say a month or two. My mixed episodes tend to trend around the same as my hypomania (but a bit longer).
bipolar2,fbirdp7,t1_fbiraz7,1576910894.0,Thanks! My hypomania can last anywhere from a few days to two weeks. Usually average around a week before crashing into a bad depression. I always enjoy listening to other people's experiences with bipolar!

bipolar,fbg38mb,t1_fbg1yc3,1576832111.0,"You're right, I only said reconsider the diagnosis as some other mental health conditions might cause similar elevated moods at times. After all, diagnoses are never 100% as the brain is a very complicated thing."

bipolar,fbdhp56,t1_fbdhksf,1576762484.0,So one hypomanic episode is required for diagnosis but I'm assuming if you didn't have any episodes ever again they would reconsider the diagnosis.
bipolar,fbdf60d,t1_fbdf3ii,1576760198.0,Well that was hopefully the purpose behind these basics ones!
bipolar,fb6dj0b,t1_fb6cud6,1576547611.0,"From what you describe it sounds like a mixed episode, which is a period of time when somebody is experiencing both manic symptoms and depressive symptoms. They can be very distressing and can last as long as any other episode.
