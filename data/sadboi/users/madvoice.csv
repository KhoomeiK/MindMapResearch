I bit the bullet and tested today (9dpo) because crying at the drop of a hat and I was greeted with the most glaring negative result ever which cements the fact that it's most likely my bipolar meds screwing with me.

Do one thing different each day. Even if it means only getting out of bed for 5 minutes! Be kind to yourself and know you're not alone even when loneliness wants to overtake you.
