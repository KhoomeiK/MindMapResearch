NoStupidQuestions,fbj0d3e,t3_edmmz5,1576921176.0,"We're super aware yeah... problem is that the ""awareness"" is our brain not being able to filter like normal brains and so it's just like if you'd turned multiple screens on with different shows all blaring loudly and not being able to follow one specific or hear it. Sometimes the brain then filters but instead of the game you'd like to see it turned into Kardashians instead of what you'd actually need to be aware off... (""Look squirrel!"" moments).  
Also means responses are usually slow because if at all possible it takes longer to be actually aware and react to things that needs reaction too if there is multiple things going on in the environment; which since we don't live in total isolation on mars there is.  
Like... you might not notice the water going through the radiator, or similar because your brain automatically filter it out as unimportant, but when my teacher goes ""Let's be quiet a moment and enjoy the silence."" all I can think is what silence because beside the water through the pipes, peoples breathing, traffic in the street outside the room, people talking in the corridor my brain also pick up randomly at every other students movement, the creaking floor etc. are all not ignored by my brain - what silence?  
Not to mention the random space outs where you just miss everything because the brain is overloaded just goes ""eff this I'm taking a break"".. I'd like to say think Win 10 forced updates; sudden closing and then eternal reboot time where you're unable to do what you want, but another way could also be sudden lag :P

NoStupidQuestions,fbiwuw1,t3_edkfcm,1576917914.0,"Start with some basic training, like general all round fitness is a good way to combat a lot of things. Desk jobs are in itself physically hard, but in another way. The back pain can very well be your back being overtasked when you both have a job standing up for a long time which is hard on the back, and a desk job that is also hard at the back.  
A good way to help is making sure you got a good core of supporting muscles, primarily back but best is whole body because it's never just one part doing the work; muscle groups work together. Been there myself unfortunately...  
But I'd get some expert help first to make sure nothing needs doing (back injuries sucks) or that training would be too much added stress on an already stressed back including possible good ways to train your back that could work for you.  


In the meantime as others have said; good posture, shoes etc.  
Also at the desk make sure your setup is ergonomically good for you, try and stand and move through the day etc. (those big training balls that you can also sit on are super fun and should be good for your back if you take your time though the day to use it as an alternate to your chair for a little bit in the day).  
Probably harder to be asked to be allowed to sit down at the bartender job...

(Training: Good way for most is swimming if you have that option because it's low impact training and works the whole body, and for most feels more fun than a day in the fitness center.)"

Actually one thing I've noticed after prolonged lack of contact; it can be a bit of a shock to the system sometimes and can take some getting used too, and is especially unpleasant if you're going from 0% contact to 110% as some people are prone too.  
So sometimes it can be helped by short interactions with low key people that get you might be having a bit of a people ""overload"", even if there is ""not many"" people.  
I personally have a max capacity of 3 people, 2 if one is a new person. Might be my ADHD and anxiety that acts up.

Sometimes nothing helps though... so you end up like the cat that want to go out the door just to want to come back in after 2 seconds...

Glad I kept well clear of anything pokémon related around the release. Enjoying the game very much also. Especially since I'm much more fond of the setting than the tropical ones - which is just an oddity of mine.  
Of course not everything is to everybodies tastes, and some things could always be better - we'd never get new games otherwise. But all in all I feel it's well worth the money, and the story + handling of it have left me pretty positive about the possible future of the franchise. Like I don't even have to 'max if I don't feel like it.  
Spent an enjoyable 60+ hours at this point just randomly doing stuff and catching Pokémons. Granted I've never been the quickest person either, but... some good $ pr. hour in gameplay value if one goes up in that.  
My only complaint is that it's annoying trying to trade with friends, but that's probably because they're waiting for those features to be in ""Pokémon Home"" the separate app... and I've never had a friend to trade with before, so I cannot say if it's better or worse.  
Just a little annoyed by  the Home sub, and hope if you already have a sub to the Switch is going to be included instead of a seperate payment... But those problems aren't the gameplay itself directly as such.  


Is it just me or does it seem like there's a growing group that just like criticizing the new games without much reason?  
Ignoring Pokémon designs because those are always either love or hate for most.
