BPD,ez0isxy,t1_eyzzbvc,1567637331.0,"Awh yah, it definitely evokes a lot of emotions seeing people who seem really rooted with who they are and what they are all about. Its like they have a sense of belonging and its looks so nice and secure. they seem like they have something precious and they are lucky to have it right. Its so easy to see that and feel left out and like theres this missing piece. Not sure if you might feel similar feelings. On the other hand, like on a positive note, for people like us that are kind of fluid and have flexible personalities I feel like theres so many benefits of people who are chameleon like.  Like a lot of us with BPD- who are able to change themselves and adapt  to situations in a world like this with so many different cultures and lifestyles, and having the ability to show others that were super fluid and adaptable to everyone can be used as an asset. It can be a powerful thing to show fluidity, willingness to change who we are, and what were about. It can be used as a strength especially when it comes down to opening up ourselves to new experiences, and just trying out something people wouldnt usually try out because it doesnt fit into their square box of what they think life should be all about.  I really admire people like you who are super changeable compared to people who are afraid of it..but it makes sense that it comes with its own set of challenges. 
 If you want that security and to develop a stronger sense of self and a belonging to something, I wish you the best with creating that for yourself, and it might take time, but hope youll get there.  Wishing you the best. At the same time just letting you know there are so many people out there going through a similar kind of experience and in that way we kind of fit in with eachother that way"
BPD,eytahpo,t3_cyjxdc,1567430956.0,"Fuck id be dissapointed too. But hey lots of guys are not very good when it comes down to making the proposal even vaguely perfect. Every proposal I ever heard of in my family was done in such a strange way, even by men Id expect to do so much better. Im sorry yours was bittersweet. That sucks. Doesnt sound like BPd at all. Sounds like your legitimately dissapointed."
BPD,eysgi7i,t3_cyiaoq,1567397409.0,Oh my god i just started medication to try and cope with myself. Im so horny all the time i actually feel like im going to die. Its so hard to deal with. And i hardly get to see my boyfriend cause he lives far and just with our schedules conflicting.  Im just trying therapy and meds for it. The meds to help with impulsivity is helping a lot i just started them but I still feel like im going crazy in my head because I constantly need sex. FYI i have BPD. Sorry to be gross.
BPD,eyqnp77,t3_cy52cz,1567348724.0,Have you ever considered yourself kind of like a chameleon? You sound very fluid.
BPD,eyo06i1,t3_cxwipj,1567266419.0,Ya. Me too. Its so weird. Maybe we are severely dehydrated. Lol
BPD,eyjtgw1,t1_eyezzfy,1567127805.0,"Thanks, just took my first pill. There seems to be a lot of mixed reviews on it but Ill let you all know how things are in some weeks"

BPD,eybhub5,t1_eybe27t,1566984756.0,Hey thanks. How have you found CBD has helped if you dont mind me asking. My issues has been with really bad impulsivity so I wonder if it would help. Thanks a lot for your advice Ill look into it I never heard of it as a treatment for BPD so interesting
BPD,eybc7tv,t1_ey7mfni,1566980948.0,Thats important to remember for sure
BPD,eybatnd,t3_cwgh65,1566980003.0,Wow No never have told anyone that before that really sucks sorry
relationship_advice,eyb3klp,t1_ey63vx1,1566975219.0,Yes both of us do. Ive had the diagnosis for a long time. Like we still have challenges. But we work through it. Its up and down but we make it work. Best of luck for everyone else trying to get through hard times
BPD,ey6122q,t1_ey5p8h0,1566844961.0,Woah
BPD,ey60sjd,t3_cvq5ho,1566844787.0,I whole heartedly relate to this and agree its fucking tiring for sure. But i know change is possible cause i seen it with my own eyes. Friends with bpd who went from being severely unhealthy and unwell in there life and relationships working hard throwing themselves hard into therapy and making long term changes and becoming well and successfully maintaining healthy relationships. Its been done before and if its possible id like to get better myself.
relationship_advice,ey5zik4,t3_cvqosb,1566843946.0," if your looking for a success story, my boyfriend and I have been through loads of life shit. Loads. But with the both of us working on ourselves. On both of our self care prioritizing that has been important... And then also putting in actual work on our relationship with counselling and therapy- Its only been getting better and more fullfilling. We have low days but we have way more good days then bad. And simply put all relationships despite whatever labels might be involved with them, they are all choke full of there own problems amd challenges. They will always come and go. 
The love we have for eachother keeps us working towards something healthier. Something better. And looking at our whole relstionship things have only gotten better. 

Ive see  that holding a standard of respect in a relationship is so crucial and important. Saying im not going to be here in the room with you if your yelling at me. Or abusing me. Were gonna have to take a break. Were gonna have to take a day apart to calm down. Im gonna have to go into the other room for 10 minutes or for an hour so we can both calm down for example Etc. Just hold a standard of expecting healthy communication and when they arent holding up to it dont encourage dont participate dont stick around. But im not meaning leave them entirely. Just take a time out its a very effective skill to have. This helps enormously.

I agree with the other person setting boundaries is important. And also defining what you need to take care of yourselves and sticking to that helps. 

Best of luck"
BPD,ey5tkwv,t3_cvpzwv,1566840021.0,Hey I just got diagnosed with bipolar and have had bpd for a long time so i have both. I think my psychiatrist said that with manic episodes your likely to get hospitalized so those episodes are more severe. Hypomanic episodes wouldnt usually be bad enough for you to get hospitalized. Can anyone else speak to this.
mentalhealth,ey25ku6,t3_cv6c1a,1566725877.0,Hey could you maybe access a psychiatrist that could advise you on medications that might help with this. Im planning on going to start meds for this.
BPD,exlw7m4,t3_b4n8rt,1566420337.0,A thing i wish my partner would know is that i hate hearing him connect all of our relationship problems to my bpd
BPD,exko6kb,t1_exkldcs,1566394983.0,Awh that sucks. It sounds difficult. Hope things get better for you
BPD,exkk52m,t3_ctfuf6,1566391941.0,"Im some cultures and homes how your feeling is rational and valid and in other cultures and homes how your feeling would be considered unhealthy. Just depends where you are in the world, and where you from and what your all about. Know your not alone, theres a ton of girls who would agree with you with how your thinking. What might be helpful is if you either strongly decide for yourself your values and boundaries you want to set in an ideal relationship for you, or decide that you will compromise them. If you both are feeling disrespected and have voiced your concerns and theres no compromise coming out of it, it sounds like it would be clear that you both are looking for something very different in a relationship."
BPD,exdzd0u,t3_csarmk,1566191890.0,Oh my god yes.
BPD,exdyq25,t3_cs0w8p,1566191207.0,"I honestly would say instead of 'hating' i start feeling distrusting and unsafe. It might be an effect of trying to keep myself safe and out of trouble. If I feel set off by people-  I know that for whatever reason Ive got a real low toleramce for bullshit that day and Ill try and give myself some space in whatever way to recoup. However lately I think in my closest relationship which would be with my boyfriend I think my constant need for space when Im overwhelmed might be harming our relationship.  I really do think this behaviour is so unkind and abusive. And i feel so sprry for anyone who has to put up with it just because its confusing isnt it? For someone to be so sweet and then terrible over something really small, and then so sweet again.."
