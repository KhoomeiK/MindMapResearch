They thanked me every time they saw me for like a year straight after that. And it earned me bonus points whenever I would run out of my subs or Xanax early they would give me like 5-10 pills to hold me over.  It was a mom n pop pharmacy tho.

Testosterone,fqda1j4,t3_gi8pzl,1589284519.0,"I had similar issues with my first few injections.  For me personally, I think it‚Äôs because my total test was 33ng.  So that first injection of 100mgs must‚Äôve shocked my hormones, causing a ton of anxiety and emotional feelings.  One second I was a horn ball next second I was crying for no reason.  It was extraordinary to say the least.   All these symptoms went away after week 3 and my depression, fatigue and sex drive felt like I was 15 again.   My labs have been great since.  One time my prostate levels were elevated but I had sex before getting the blood work done so my Dr said that‚Äôs probably why it showed high......I believe he said prostate and prolactin levels rise after ejaculation, so makes sense I guess.

My general rule is NSAIDs for pain and Tylenol for fevers.  As Tylenol does work better for fevers but Advil is way better for pain.

The accords feel way under dosed. Just google reviews of patients who‚Äôs pharmacies switched to Accord.  Ppl say it feels like a placebo or water pill. Some ppl even get WDs.

benzodiazepines,fqctihr,t1_fqblqdf,1589268429.0,"Is your provider that‚Äôs prescribing u the Xanax younger dr or older.  I ask because Valium is a old school benzo which most young doctors don‚Äôt care to Rx. My best friend is a primary care doctor in Texas and when he comes back home to visit we talk.  I asked him about this and he said he was taught to Rx Valium for elders and patients who want to taper off a benzo they‚Äôre currently taking.  Other wise he said he was told to stick with Xanax Klonopin and Ativan. He actually said that he hates to prescribe benzos at all but he will after all other options have ceased to work. Or he‚Äôll prescribe it with an SSRI for the first 6 weeks until the SSRI takes affect then discontinue the benzo.  


Idk man medical school students these days are being taught a lot of different shit.  Like for example buprenorphine only for maintenance treatment for opioid addicts and that methadone is awful.  Which studies show is completely incorrect.  Methadone is the number 1 tool that helps heroin addicts get off heroin.

Oh and I‚Äôm on testosterone cypionate as well but that‚Äôs from my hormone doctor (Endocrinologist). I just have to fill all my controlled substances at the same pharmacy. So it sucks when they have my preferred generic brand of Klonopin but a shitty generic brand for Adderall.  Smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I guess beggars can‚Äôt be choosers though so I do what I gotta do...."
Testosterone,fqcsam5,t1_fqbt8f2,1589267279.0,"Hey as long as it‚Äôs working, keep on doing it.  Everybody‚Äôs different so just cause it‚Äôs happens to the majority don‚Äôt mean anything. Hope you‚Äôre feeling well man. Good luck with everything going forward brother."
Testosterone,fqcs1in,t1_fqbt46v,1589267047.0,"Hey, if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it. Lol."
Testosterone,fqcryys,t1_fqbs94l,1589266983.0,Nice. Hope you‚Äôre doing well.  Life changer for me (trt)
benzodiazepines,fqbk6c1,t1_fqbj3sq,1589238508.0,"I‚Äôm surprised they give u Xanax but not Valium.  Valium and Klonopin are long acting benzos which Drs consider to not be abused as much as fast acting benzos like Xanax or Ativan.  

Any Dr I went to always preferred Valium or Klonopin first before giving me Xanax."
benzodiazepines,fqbjtio,t1_fqbj3sq,1589238315.0,"Kpins have never ever smacked me even in HS with no benzo tolerance.  They just eliminate my anxiety all day without giving a buzz, which is good for benzo addicts who still need benzos such as my self.  

As far as Xanax goes it‚Äôs different.  Xanax comes on harder and faster.  Valium takes like 45 mins to start feeling it and it‚Äôs more chill and relaxing.  With Valium you‚Äôre still aware of what you‚Äôre doing and what‚Äôs going on but u just don‚Äôt care lol but with too much Xanax I‚Äôm sure u know u can black out and not remember shit. 

Xanax I prefer for panic attacks.  Valium I prefer for general anxiety throughout the day."
Testosterone,fqbj9d7,t1_fqbj163,1589238017.0,"Thanks man neither do I, glad to hear u agree that it‚Äôs not needed either."
Testosterone,fqbic1i,t1_fqbi1fb,1589237524.0,"You can get them without a script in MD but it‚Äôs up to the pharmacist whether he wants to give it or not.  He shouldn‚Äôt refuse you, if he does just show them your testosterone prescription that‚Äôs all."
trt,fqbi219,t3_fn65z4,1589237376.0,"Even tho the federal guidelines for the normal range are I believe between 260ng/dL-950ng/dL.  264 and 230 are lowwww.  Honestly I believe any male with levels under 350 should be a candidate for TRT.  


My total test was 33ng/dL! No bullshit, I thought I was dying. I had no energy to move and I was depressed and didn‚Äôt even think of sex for 5 months.  Turns out it was my methadone prescription that diminished my levels.  I didn‚Äôt know methadone did that but my Dr first question was if I was on opioids.  I was 26yo at the time and he said in his 22 years of practicing he‚Äôs never seen such low levels for someone in there 20s. Smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Methadone saved my life but man those side effects were cruel in the beginning.  Thank God all is well nowadays! üôèüèª"
Testosterone,fqbh3v4,t1_fqbgoor,1589236865.0,"I was stupid and specifically told him I wanted the 25g for my test instead of 22g so he says no now every time I ask because ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the doctors orders‚Äù pshtttt


Depends what state ur in.  Some states u can walk in without a prescription and buy needles other states u need an Rx.   What state u in?"
drugsarebeautiful,fqbgs29,t3_ghu0r9,1589236689.0,My pharmacy didn‚Äôt have enough Teva in stock. Only 36 Teva the rest are Accord.  Sucks :( I hate Accord pharma kpins.......
Testosterone,fqbggy3,t1_fqbfsej,1589236524.0,"Always I actually inject like 1.5ml of air first.  


Do u aspirate to see if ur not in a vein or vessel? A lot of ppl said I should but my pharmacist said there‚Äôs no need and that it‚Äôs not even taught in medical school anymore for IM injections.  And believe it or not my Endocrinologist agreed, saying there‚Äôs no reason to aspirate when going an inch or further into a muscle......"
Testosterone,fqbfz2q,t1_fq9xupk,1589236262.0,"This is what majority of bodybuilders recommended for me as well. Except some said 25g 1 inch some said 5/8ths.  So you‚Äôre doing it right cause these guys were pro bodybuilders that have been on gear for decades

(I only spoke to 4 to be honest though, but still)"
Testosterone,fqbflll,t1_fq9z704,1589236067.0,Whatttttt.  I use 22g and it takes like over a minute to draw up .75ml from my vials. U must be a fuckin pro lol. Foreal tho that‚Äôs awesome man.
Testosterone,fqbfeow,t1_fq9ud12,1589235968.0,Same!
Testosterone,fqbfbvm,t1_fq9u04z,1589235928.0,"But aren‚Äôt u suppose to inject oils very slowly? I used to inject very fast and would be sore and was told by multiple bodybuilders to inject very slow with oil based products. My Dr said for absorption reasons it doesn‚Äôt matter but for swelling and pain injecting slower is the way to go. 

Idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just stating what I‚Äôve been told and what works for me that‚Äôs all. Everyone is different though, so whatever works for you brother."
Testosterone,fqbeuu5,t1_fqavunv,1589235686.0,You‚Äôre correct
Testosterone,fqbeq6m,t1_fqam5ek,1589235621.0,"That‚Äôs cause 31s are technically not meant for injecting oils.  Also just to give u a tip if u want to use 31g try backloading.  Get like an 18g and draw up the testosterone from the vial, then take ur 31 and remove the plunger and inject the test into the 31 from the back/top of the syringe then put plunger back on and you‚Äôre ready to inject.   Otherwise I‚Äôm sure it takes forever to suck up testosterone from the vial with a 31. 


Also do u IM with 31 or subq? Just got curious lol."
Testosterone,fqbe5m3,t1_fq9scot,1589235325.0,"I been using 22s for years. In the glute it‚Äôs painless, but quad and delt injections are somewhat painful and leave soreness at injection site for couple days. I want 25G but my pharmacist won‚Äôt budge.  I‚Äôm just gonna buy online cause I live in a state where u don‚Äôt need an Rx for needles/syringes anymore."
Testosterone,fqbdr65,t3_ghno45,1589235114.0,"I recently made a post about this.  My Dr Rxs me 22g inch and half.  For my glute it‚Äôs fine but I prefer quad injections and would rather 25g. 

To answer your question everyone‚Äôs different. Also depends if you‚Äôre doing an IM injection or subq injection."
