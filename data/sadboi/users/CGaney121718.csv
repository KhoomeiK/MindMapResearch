Doesn't really matter which way you brush, just be sure you're doing it in sections, so you don't miss any. Don't forget to not hold the dryer too close to the hair or you will get it tangled! As for the paws, I trim the nails first and then brush the hair to the right side then scissor with the curves (to the curve of their foot). Then I will brush to the left, flip your scissors where they are facing the curve of the foot and scissor again. Then, I will brush all the hair up, that's on the top of the paw. You can use your thinning shears or your curves, it's preference really lol Once you brush the hair on the top of the foot up, you'll see that these are the  scraggly hairs that stick between the toes is now up and you'll want to scissor all of that to match her hair that is already short and lays naturally. I hope this made sense lol
