Notice that ""6"" chords also sound like minor seventh chords. F 6 sounds like D min 7 (d,f,a,c). I am no expert on this, it's just I'm really not sure what chords to pick between the two atm.

Maybe it's avoiding social media, cutting off toxic people from your life (my uncle, against whom I have lot of resentment, but I try to not even mention him or think about him)

Also physical activity can help to express your anger. Things like calisthenics, weight lifting, combat sports."
