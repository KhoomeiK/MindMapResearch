depression,f811uto,t3_dyazjo,1574146255.0,"I really feel for you.. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in this headspace. I‚Äôm not a mom, but I can assume you don‚Äôt feel like you have much excitement in your life anymore? I can also assume that you aren‚Äôt filled with confidence in yourself at the moment? I just wanna tell you that time heals all, I know you probably hate hearing that. Depression is a real thing and maybe talking to a loved one honestly and openly about how you feel may help you have some closure and when you explain how you feel they will be there for you. I would maybe talk to a psychologist. That‚Äôs nothing to be embarrassed about it‚Äôs just nice to be able to release all the pent up stresses of the day. I don‚Äôt know you, but I‚Äôm sending you healing vibes. I hope all turns out well if you ever need a friend or someone to talk you out of a hard time you can always hit my messages. Stay strong 

A fellow friend with depression, you‚Äôre not alone."

depression,f3edstd,t1_f3edg3a,1570871171.0,Thank you so much for all the information this really helped me think clearly. And there aren‚Äôt many bus stops where I live I‚Äôd have to walk about a half hour to get to a bus stop. Mostly what scares me is getting off medication one day I‚Äôm scared it will be really hard and I‚Äôll depend on it. I agree I think exercising will help but the only problem is is that I literally wake up everyday with 0 motivation. Always so groggy and just not my real self. I have a referral to talk to a psychologists hopefully that helps my situation and they can help me. I get so much motivation at night time but morning are just not my thing but I want them to be!!!!
depression,f3edlt4,t1_f3eddia,1570870841.0,I replied to your comment but didn‚Äôt add it to our thread on accident so check it out it‚Äôs in the comments
depression,f3edio0,t3_dgsge9,1570870690.0,Thank you sorry for the information. I really appreciate your spirit. You are a good person and I‚Äôm sorry anyone people have hurt you in your life time. People can be mean and reflect their own insecurities on you. Just always know that what you did today was very kind and I know you‚Äôre a good soul. Don‚Äôt let anyone change that no matter how nasty they can get. There are lots of good people in the world and I‚Äôm glad I found one tonight. I think maybe medication will be good for me. I just always saw my mother as a child and always told my self I‚Äôm strong enough with out it but I‚Äôm not... I don‚Äôt even wanna get it if bed almost everyday...
depression,f3ed4gu,t1_f3ecwzf,1570870026.0,Also what differences do you notice now you‚Äôre being treated? How long does it take to start working and do you feel happier or does it just take away those deep depression thoughts?
depression,f3ed1xz,t1_f3ecwzf,1570869907.0,"No worries, thank you. Sometimes you just need to get a prospective from someone you aren‚Äôt so close to to understand. I get scared cause when I need to get off them it may be hard and I wanna just be normal and happy but I know I‚Äôm not. I don‚Äôt wanna have to depend on meds forever. I‚Äôm from Washington, I have health care and I just got a referral to a psychologist. I‚Äôm gonna go talk to someone. I live with back pain and I struggle staying 100lbs there‚Äôs just lots of different factors in my depression it‚Äôs not just that but that definitely adds to it."
depression,f3ectka,t1_f3ecs65,1570869515.0,Thank you. I just literally need help before I drown in my depression. I wanna feel excited again I wanna find happiness in a cup of coffee or a sunny day or just being alive!!!!
