bipolar,f94xfkh,t1_f94x3mm,1575108729.0,i’m glad that he let me go bc i wouldn’t have walked away from him.
bipolar,f94piz0,t1_f94oy99,1575097171.0,"i am so sorry. but that means you got rid of someone who didn’t care for you. there are other people out there who’s gonna care for you even tho you can’t even care for yourself. 💜

my other ex friend found himself a girl (they’re not even dating) and left me alone. (he used to have a crush on me.) he blocked me on all social media bc i didn’t want to tell him why i feel down almost every day. when i told him i was diagnosed with bp2 he laughed and made fun of me and also said
 ‘that explains why u were always having anger attacks and hurting everything around you’  that made me so fucking sad and i started to blame myself. 

i stopped talking with him, and then he blocked me again. i’m not gonna try and talk to him again bc it’s not my fault AT ALL. this fucking illness ruins my life sometimes, but i have to learn how to live with it i guess. 
bless u 💜"
