teaching,fim14rb,t1_fijdolc,1582515376.0,"Lots of other teachers enforce a cell phone policy. Blaming the students for your failure to manage your classroom is not good teaching. 

* I enforce a cell phone policy.The students mentioned are exempt from following the rules. I am not allowed to give black students the standard consequences. A leftist agenda forced upon the school, by nonteaching professionals, gets to dictate my classroom. 

* It's rude to keep calling me a failure, but if that makes you feel better about yourself, have at it. At least it's not more racism. 

*The students were prompted and they didn't listen. They failed themselves by choice. 

The BSU isn't the honors society. It's a social club. Nowhere in its mandate are students expected to be experts on history. 

* They are going to a BSU civil rights event. Learning about civil rights before going is reasonable.

*I never asked them to be experts. They are 12th graders. I teach at level. I expect the class to participate and pass an exam. Extra help is readily available.

If the black students are the only ones not engaged with your lessons on the civil war, maybe your content or method of instruction is out of touch? But nah, let's blame kids and attribute their failure to their race or degenerate cultural values. Classy!

*You're assuming I'm a failure again. The lesson was very engaging. We did lecture with guided notes, used VR headsets to do a guided tour, a round Kahoot, and made collages on Google Slides. 

*Adding words like degenerate is going to hurt your credibility. Take time to reflect on why you chose to call them degenerates. 

Yes, we encounter students from diverse backgrounds. Some of our students come from generational poverty, some come from different cultures. That can be very challenging. Blaming the kids for their failure to learn is the trap that  bitter, racist teacher I've ever met has fallen into. No, you can't ""save"" every student but we should strive to alter some of our strategies to fit the needs of our communities and meet our students where they are at. 

*They aren't failing to learn. Nobody is failing the class. Assuming the black students are unable to learn is straight up racist.

* Blaming the kids for their failure to learn is the trap that  bitter, racist teacher I've ever met has fallen into.
***A few paragraphs down, is where your projection made more.obvious:

""We taught for 4 years abroad in a very different culture. *It's very hard not to become embittered and resentful.****
*How do I alter a VR lesson? You put goggles and explore  3D environment.

*I modify materials and lessons for the students who need it. The group addressed in my post do well at grade level. It's their right to receive an appropriate education. Your advice is based on racial profiling. No thanks.

You don't have a lifetime of being treated differently based on your race, so it's easy for you to trivialize their complaints as childish and petty. Maybe you should check your privilege. Think before you attack people, my goodness!!!
*Yes, I do. I disclosed that to you yesterday after I became fed up with your micro-aggressions. Then you attacked me with racially charged response:

""She called me racist! How dare she! Doesn't she know I'm not white?! FAKE NEWS!

*Yesterday you assumed I am white and failed at doing damage control afterwards. The scripted jargon you use is what radical leftists use against whites. 
* I needed time to cool off from that. You judged me and then tried to lie about it. 
*Maybe you should check your facts, your privilege, and suppressed racism. 

Dealing with families and communities entrenched in generational poverty can be extremely frustrating and disheartening. Dealing with a 16 year old on her second pregnancy who has no concept of how much she is holding herself back in life is frustrating. Dealing with families that don't value education is frustrating. Dealing with cultures or communities that don't teach kids social skills that facilitate classroom functioning is frustrating. 

*""Dealing with cultures or communities that don't teach kids social skills that facilitate classroom functioning is frustrating.""- - I don't ""deal"" with those issues. I offer support. It doesn't feel like not a burden to me.

* Thanks for recognizing that social skills are an issue instead of dumping all over my ability again.

We taught for 4 years abroad in a very different culture. It's very hard not to become embittered and resentful. Rather than blaming the kids, we took a hard look at ourselves and what the barriers were. What is preventing kids from accessing their education? Sometimes it's just plain disinterest, and as much as you try different strategies you're not going to be able to overcome that all by yourself. You have to cut your losses in some cases. Blaming a child without fully developed brain function is certainly not what good teachers do, though. Disparaging a culture you are observing from the outside is not what good teachers do. We met plenty of those who did, and we made an active effort to steer clear of those people. They blame their kids, hate the families, and are bitter racist jerks. 

* This is my favorite paragraph because the contradicting statements really shine.

* ""It's very hard not to become embittered and resentful"" I'm sorry this is a struggle for you. We already established you are projecting. 

* Disinterest is a possibility? I thought my lesson plans weren't engaging enough because I'm a failure.
*I have never given up on a student. That's why I posted. I was hoping to get some advice from a non-racist.
*You disparaged my culture, my personality, and ability to teach by making nasty, racist assumptions about me this whole time.

*You are one of the bitter racist jerks, but your privilege keeps you in the dark. Reflect.

* The 4 years of frustration probably reinforced your racist values. 

We left when we started to feel frustrated. Maybe you need a break from this population and would benefit from a lateral move in a different district so you can clear your head and gain some perspective. But talking shit on black kids is certainly not how you become a great teacher.

* I'm glad you took a break. Your racism may have escalated to a higher level.

*I love my students and I am not leaving them because of some racist stranger on Reddit suggested it. 

*That is an extreme suggestion. My students have family who abandoned them. You suggested I inject more trauma into their lives. 

*You're suggesting another district isn't going to have a diverse culture which is a weird thing to say. I don't need to take a break from my diverse environment. 

*I'm glad I don't need to take breaks to step away from culture. That would be racist.

*I didn't need to clear my head until you polluted it with your shameful commentary.

*You talked shit on me this entire time. You're a teacher. Be a role model. 

*Your privilege doesn't give you the authority to call me a failure, a bad teacher, or minimize my life experience. 

I'm sorry there is so much hate in your heart and that it comes out this way. Spend more time working on yourself and less time obsessing over black people. It shows that you are hiding something.The overkill suggests you feel guilt about deeply ingrained and suppressed racism.

Your whole identity seems to revolve around being a racist, SJW prototype, who is ashamed of being a failure.

Stop attacking people if you want to create change. Spreading hate and belittling people gives them a reason to ignore the points you are trying to get across."

3. No, my post addressed the group of students who chose not to learn. The ultimate failures are the parents who don't raise their kids and then teach those kids that white people are evil and allow them to blown off their education.

4. The students who participated in class can do this because they chose to learn. No, it's not a function of racism.

The original point is these students are throwing words around carelessly. I don't want them to be grouped into false stereotyping or create their own set backs. 

One should know what racism is before pointing fingers or attributing something to racism and slavery. Why isn't there any interest in becoming knowledgeable on the topic? I want them to be able to back up their claims.

I want to trust what they say but it's challenging.
The Ramseys have shown their many sides and I try to remain objective by thinking about the variables involved. High emotions, prescription medication, legal council, etc. 

*sigh* LOL"

Take Obsessive Thinking Disorder for example. The bothersome and unwanted thoughts are involuntary. It doesn't make one a bad person, and typically causes feelings of shame and fear.

On a separate note, magicalÂ thinking, a cognitive distortion,Â is the belief thatÂ thinkingÂ or wishing something can cause it to occur. 
If Patsy believed her thought caused Jonbenet's death, she could have been expressing guilt in her writing.

I could go on and on, but I think 2 examples gets the point across."

The public is not entitled to Burke's PHI. They can take issue with HIPAA. *Good luck* lol

*""But secondly -- what does being diagnosed as being ""on the spectrum"" have to do with murder? The suggestion that is relates to criminality or criminal behavior is outrageous -- and a dangerous lie.""*

Absolutely!!!

I work in the Intervention & Supports department. My understanding is rooted in compassion, work experience, adherance to ethical practices, and mental flexibility.

That being said, I think an ASD could make a difference in the case. For instance, I'd want to audit the police interviews and the individuals who conducted them. What qualifications did they hold? Were they trained to facilitate a proper interview? Are the interviews valid?
I don't to go off on a long tangent based on hypothetical diagnosis, so I'll leave it at that. 

Nasty people suck! Give them a little perspective and place the same demands on them! LOL

Thank you for responding :)"
JonBenetRamsey,fegjfg2,t1_fefskoq,1579094613.0,"I agree with you. There are much more interesting pieces to dissect compared to the ones I posted.

The statements are interesting to me so I opened a discussion. I enjoy reading what other people have to say whether they agree with me or not. That's how I learn.

I do not think Burke is on the spectrum either. When his usual behavior is assumed to be related to ASD my head spins because there isn't evidence of a formal diagnosis. He doesn't owe the public his personal medical information and I'm sure he is aware that confirming or denying ASD could harm or help his character."
JonBenetRamsey,feft4l3,t1_fefp4ux,1579064400.0,"Very good point about the choice of words!

The Ramseys have demonstrated a gentleness in nature toward the murderer during other interviews too. 

Emotional responses to a situation will vary between individuals, but the Ramseys are noteworthy."
JonBenetRamsey,fefrcp3,t1_fednnq9,1579062965.0,"I could go on and on about Burke's behavior. 

There has been speculation of Burke being on the Autism Spectrum. 

Sometimes his abnormal behavior is excused or dismissed because of that speculation which is not helpful. 
 

Care to share what you think about Burke?"
