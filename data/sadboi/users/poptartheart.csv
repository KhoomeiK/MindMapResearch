like, take Top Chef for example. all these strangers get on the show and in like 4 hours John and Jennifer (fake names) are laughing about something and John touches her shoulder. like why the fuck are u touching someone that soon?
or weirder- when someone early on gets eliminated after having almost no connection to- they hug like 16 people before leaving like theyre best friends??...its just weird (to me.)


also- its ok to have a fucking opinion and theres no need to talk Down. its totally ok to think its weird when strangers touch other strangers in familiar ways when there is no real familiarity... and its totally ok to to not think its weird.

id say in general call and actually talk to your school loan providers to come up with options. They often want me to pay X amount (i have 30k in loans) and i say i cant. and i can usually find a way to qualify for a forbearance of some kind. honestly just applying for any kind of help allows them to put a temporary forbearance on them. 
BUT i dont and have not ever made anywhere near that kind of money (gotta love under-employment! lol)
ANYWAY- get it sorted out and your next credit report should show an improvement but will take some time- so not super helpful. 


in regards to moving decide what area of town you wanna live. then google apartments and look at the ones in that area that have good ratings (most dont- i filter newest comments and i overlook people who clearly are pissed at management cuz they didnt pay rent or something and got evicted..)

there are also realtor type folks who show apartments and condos and are FREE (they get paid by the people wanting to lease their place) 

while credit can be an issue- if you make enough money things should work out. maybe even offer to pay multiple months up front? 

if nothing works out you'll have to move to places that dont care about credit and those places suck. its not sugar coated- they suck. we live in one now- its not due to our credit but due to our low income. we qualify to live here. 
its part of the american reality- you choose to go to college and get loans (like everyone in your life told you to do) and you get sick (shame on you!) then its up to you to pull up them bootstraps! its bullshit

another suggestion would be googling and calling a domestic violence shelter and asking about resources. lots of those agencies help people from all situations in life- and they could possibly connect you with someone to help you look and find a place to live. social workers do that- you have a problem and they find resources to help solve that problem. 

its ok you dont know all the steps in finding an apartment because you've never done that before. im really sorry that other ass hole shamed you.- common thread in domestic violence situations is that the perpetrator is usually the one who handles all the big decisions. it keeps the victim helpless and without options. 
but it hasnt evolved into you not being able to use the internet (it will) so use that tool and try and get out as quickly as you can. call a domestic violence shelter or a hotline and explain your situation and talk about what you need- people are trained to help people like you transition out of situations. (source- been a social worker for years but not in dallas)

it will only get worse and get harder"
Dallas,fp0xlrx,t1_fp0vusc,1588219226.0,"i can say that yes- i look down on people making horrible, incorrect decisions that threaten peoples lives

i dont look down on you for disagreeing. they do a great job at keeping their jobs. its very clear. 

i think when it comes to horrible men like donald trump and his cohort -everyone is forced to be tribal. 

the man is immoral, a total idiot, has no idea the consequences of what hes doing, he's endangering the lives of americans in more ways than one with his narcissistic bullshit.

he straight up engenders distrust for the institutions designed to give clarity, give instruction, protect the public, and check and balance the Office- ALL because they challenge him. because he.is.wrong."

Dallas,fmti5zg,t1_fmthmip,1586373137.0,"but does that attitude manifest itself in other behaviors different there than in the city? since its more spread out and not so much on top of you daily (we live in dallas proper)

honestly most of my distaste just comes from being in a city and a god damn apartment with loud ass obnoxious people. 

i just wanna rent a nice house in tyler with a yard, drink beer in a garage, and go to Stanley's lol
i'll probably be able to tolerate people a lot more if i actually got a break from the shit"
Dallas,fmthewf,t1_fmt3t7g,1586372765.0,"im really sorry you got bit. thats scary. how did the owner react?

id like to see some stats before and after cities started making leash ordinances."
Dallas,fmth4ls,t1_fmt3wrn,1586372623.0,"i just dont how people DONT think about what you just mentioned. it seems so obvious. 
let alone the numerous signs at EVERY park saying dogs must be leashed. its not a suggestion lol. its there to protect everyone including THEIR dog"
Dallas,fmtgw89,t1_fmtabin,1586372508.0,"yeah. i am not from here and i would have to say the same thing. maybe its just dallas tho? i witness such severe lack of consideration daily. whether its traffic or in stores or, like we're discussing, at parks. 
(who the fuck smokes a cigarette ON the playground around 10 other parents and 15 kids???... sorry, unrelated. happened like 4 months ago but now im gettin all fired up talkin about asshole inconsiderate dallasites lol)

my wife IS from here and says dallas has the notoriety. dallasites seem pretty proud of this and that confuses me too. like- you WANT to be known as the city that doesnt give a fuck and the whole move it or lose it  attitude??? 
were movin to east texas in sept hopefully. its been a challenging 3 years here. we moved from denver. dallas is DEF not my vibe. were ready to leave the city-life for sure"
