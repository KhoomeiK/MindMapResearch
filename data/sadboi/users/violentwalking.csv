I can see a good case for Bayek though because there are some huge people that he takes down. 
The finishers from Revelations era Ezio come to mind though.

He turned around to get something and then heard a *thud*. They were both doctors and he had experience working in Neurosurgery and had a good idea that it was an aneurysm rupture. So the first thing he did was to check her pupils and they were completely unresponsive. 
Worst part was that even if they had found it in a CAT scan previously, in the UK they don’t closely monitor aneurysms until they’re 6mm across and my mum’s was 4mm. So whichever way you look at it, there’s quite literally nothing that could have been done. She just dropped dead with nothing to even learn from."

Currently what's keeping me going is the thought that I don't have the capacity to commit suicide.

[Ephemeral by Intervals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcVZ3OL4YE4)

My mum lived to 56 and passed away from a ruptured aneurysm I spend a lot of time now thinking about just how unfair it was her to pass away that young.

And I've just  I've now gotten myself a job and am starting again with a University closer to home.

Honestly though it's good to hear that I'm not the only one who gets this destructive pattern. My dad's spent so much time asking me why I've been like this and I literally can't explain it to him and I feel like I can't explain it to other people because they literally wouldn't' be able to imagine the mindset.

Recently I've just been feeling really empty just before going to bed. I used to love the time I had just before going to sleep because it meant I could be alone and browse Reddit or listen to music or watch something.

At times I value this over even the plot of a film. I find myself returning to watch Avatar just because it holds my attention by accompanying a bright colour palette with lots of uses of blue and James Horner's powerful orchestral soundtrack. It really holds my attention despite the completely unoriginal plot.

As for 500 Days, the characters in it to me seem more real than the vast majority of rom coms. To me the ending seems more hopeful. He's going towards a career path that he wants to and even though it may look like he's about to go through the same thing again and hasn't learned anything and still holds his rom com ideals,  at least he's moving on with his life."
