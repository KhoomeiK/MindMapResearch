BorderlinePDisorder,fg4iuo6,t1_fg3g8ee,1580504146.0,I started taking a low dose (4.5mg) naltrexone at night for a few months and it has really helped my dissociation a lot. It works by blocking your brains opioid receptors for a small amount of time so that your body makes more of its own. That’s how my psychiatrist explained it. We had to try a few different doses but it is worth asking your psychiatrist about
BorderlinePDisorder,fg4hxzb,t3_ewqhh0,1580503614.0,"Hey, I was diagnosed with BPD  about 18 months  ago and have tried a few different med regimens. I too dissociate A LOT. I have been on Lamotrigine and Risperidone for anger, psychotic, and emotional behaviors. And it has really helped my trigger threshold and the length of my episodes. I also started about 4 months ago taking low dose naltrexone at night to help with dissociation. If you want any deeper explanation message me. My doc is great at teaching and I’ve done a lot of research on my own as I’ve been taking meds and experienced changes. Props for wanting to change. I know it’s hard, but I look back a year ago and I have come so far in functioning and enjoying life."

BPD,ewbxzak,t3_cnj048,1565274031.0,"I used to be obsessed with this. Thought there was no way I would live long enough to accomplish life goals, have a family, know how it feels to be old. I thought and believed that I would be the first of my siblings to die and that my bad decisions, broken head, and horrid luck would kill me soon. But somehow I’ve made it to 28, sober-ish, and feel an upswing because my SO and son remind me that I have as much reason to want to die old as my brain gives me for dying young. Chance the rapper has a line “used to have an obsession with the 27 club, now I’m turning 27, wanna make it to the 2070 club”"

BorderlinePDisorder,erc0kq0,t3_c18lly,1560699497.0,I feel ya dude. I was recently diagnosed after a long battle with therapy and myself. You’re making the right moves. I hit myself too and smoke way too much weed as well just to feel like I can function properly. But DBT and mindfulness practice has helped me a lot with my impulse control. PM me if you need to talk

BPD,eraxzx2,t3_c14scm,1560655714.0,"I feel this completely! Why do I wake up feeling so painfully lonely in the middle of the night? And I can’t wake up my wife or kids just because I feel so alone and sad. But then it hits in the middle of the day too, when I’m supposed to be working or accomplishing things around the house and I just can’t shake the loneliness or the dread that it will last forever."
BPD,eqzgnjn,t3_bzva9o,1560399718.0,"I worry about it everyday. I met my son when he turned two, shortly after I met his mom. About 6 months into our relationship he started calling me “dad”. TOTAL GAMECHANGER! My brain freaks out daily  telling me that I am fucking him up for life.  or that even if I get better, the damage has already been done. But every parent gets better as they go on.  And he’s 5.5 now, he still looks at me and says “you’re the best dad,” and I say “you’re the best boy”. When he says it I can believe it. He’s the reason I hate half the things I do and say, but he’s the reason I want to change. He keeps me grounded and he loves me even more than I can imagine. Yeah having kids worries the shit out of me but it is possible and wonderful."
BPD,eqciqfu,t3_by1273,1559970572.0,"I do this almost daily. I call it over the top recoil. When I have a really good time with other people or a very  exciting experience, my emotions start to go “over the top” in a positive way. But when it’s all over and I start to reflect, the experience is like a boomerang that swings back around and hits me in the face. And then none of it was good anymore."

BorderlinePDisorder,epslfd8,t1_epsj4qr,1559453552.0,She really is amazing! I know sometimes she doesn’t understand and she gets tired of my shit but I wouldn’t have even found a diagnoses if she hadn’t pushed and payed me through therapy. She protected me from myself more than I know.

BorderlinePDisorder,epqfe12,t3_bv3u0z,1559404910.0,28 and been with my wife for 3 years. Before her I thought love and family were luxuries way out of my reach (and some days I still do) but my wise mind knows she loves me and that I love her. She’s been by my side through every fight and every cry. She forced me to therapy and dr appts for over a year before I finally got this diagnoses and she is still learning and working with me to live better. It is hard as hell and it hurts so bad some days. But love is real... even for people like us. It just takes a really awesome person to love us as big as we can feel.

BorderlinePDisorder,epjv3ar,t3_buxzpq,1559261088.0,"I’ve been working sooo hard on just this and I can’t ever seem to catch the anger before I lose control. But something my therapist told me last week might help: he said when I am already emotionally overloaded and I feel out of control, try to do the opposite action to what your impulse says. Ex: the urge is to walk back in and say one more thing. Instead, try to stay away or stay quiet for a minute. Even if it doesn’t calm you down it might keep you from saying one more mean thing. And that is a win."

BorderlinePDisorder,ep5tlg9,t3_bu1oky,1559060729.0,"I understand how you feel. There is nothing worse than being painfully aware that you are acting or thinking irrationally about something of minimal importance. But you just can’t stop it. Sometimes I wish I didn’t know my mind or body so well because I don’t always understand it and I rarely can control. Then i remember that awareness is just our first stepping stone on a long path. Being painfully aware is better than being blissfully blind. But when I am stuck in anxious thought loops, the sunshine always helps. Hope you get some peace and fresh air."
