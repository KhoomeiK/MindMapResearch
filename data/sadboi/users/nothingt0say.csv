I am eventually going to get clean. Everyone seems to get so worked up over me saying methadone makes me tired because I am still using on top of it. I don't use every day anymore, that's a huge step. Plenty of people don't use at all and say it makes them tired. No one is saying it doesn't work! Well, at least I'm not. Being tired is a side effect I am going to have to figure out how to work with.

My top priority is snowboarding. You can say that's stupid and I need to make getting clean my top priority etc etc. But it's my life, I'll chose how to live it. Snowboarding is what I live for. The past 2 years, having a habit riding was AWFUL. The first year, it was just pills and dope so I could keep myself well on our overnight weekend trips to the mountains. Last year, when I got on the clinic in December, I really was hoping it would magically get me off dope. I was prepared to arrange my snowboarding trips around dosing. But my goal is to have a regular winter in the mountains this year. I am going up one more time. But I absolutely absolutely have to either be OFF the stuff, or clean and getting take homes for the weekends by the time it snows. This is my motivation. I am taking one more dose increase on Friday, so cross your fingers for me that this is the magic number!

I think being addicted to the needle and the act of shooting up is the problem. I often manage to go 2 or 3 days without, then usually cave in. Where I live, fentanyl is dirt cheap. $30/grams. Always easy to get. Butt I am going to get it one of these days! Who knows, maybe 70 is the magic number.
