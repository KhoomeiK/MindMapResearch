veganrecipes,fel8upc,t3_eprc2x,1579216580.0,"This is by no means a set recipe, I used what I had in my fridge to make it work:

1 Large yellow onion, diced. 2 minced cloves of garlic. 1 large carrot, grated. 1 large can of diced tomatoes, 1 jar of pasta sauce, 1 tablespoon of maple syrup, 1/2 cup of textured vegetable protein (TVP: has the same texture as ground beef), sliced olives, Salt and Pepper to taste, Crushed red pepper, chilli powder, dried oregano, dried basil. The longer you simmer the better it tastes, adjust to your liking. I would have added mushrooms if I had some."

depression,f86p022,t3_dz427e,1574303475.0,"I think what you're saying is valid and I know where you're coming from. I also think it's important to remember that this is a community of all different types of people (strangers mostly) with different personalities and different ways of dealing with things and if you post here you should expect to get a variety of types of responses. Thats the beauty of Reddit. I wouldn't take it negatively. I would suggest maybe ending your future posts with \*not looking for advice\* if it really bothers you but I think the best way to deal with this is to try to empathize with the people giving advice, they're usually coming from a good place. We're all in this together."

I BELIEVE and you should too
Life is testing you and how you respond to your situation will define the rest of your life. I know it's nearly impossible to not be negative in your situation, but you CAN do it. BELIEVE in yourself and have FAITH that there is a purpose for your pain. Steer the pain in the right direction with your perception, know that it is serving you in a way you can't understand right now and perhaps it will be the reason you become the person you are meant to be.
You've got this!"
