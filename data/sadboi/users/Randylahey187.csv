UFC3,fmtyy5j,t1_fms3t00,1586381503.0,"I'll give you the 2 bars. They are a bit ridiculous but some submissions do get locked in that quickly IRL. And a BIG tip. If someone locks in that Triangle with Ortega or Nate or whoever, watch out for the green prompt your opponent gets to convert tbe sub to an armbar. If you can hit that prompt first, your opponent won't get the armbar and your gates will become easier to get out of. Hope that makes sense.

Watch out for the clinch subs. Personally I find those cheesier. You've got the rollong kneebar from over under, I think Tony Ferguson has that, Joe Soto in BW aswell. I think there's a triangle from double under? I hit that with Ortega before. And you've got the flying armbar from Thai Clinch and the Guillotine from Thai.

‚òùÔ∏èAll of the above are 2 gate clinch subs with no green prompts. So your fucked if you've got bad sub defense stats and Tony Ferguson or someone gets you in one of these. I'ma try tell you how to deny all them but maybe check it on YouTube or something just to make sure. I still fuck up denying these things a lot.

To deny the Rolling Kneebar from over under, hold right trigger(R2) And go up on your right stick.

To deny the triangle from double under, Hold R2, flick down on your right stick.

To deny the flying armbar from hell in thai clinchhthat Rhonda players will definitely try and put on you, Hold R2 Flick Up.

To deny the thai clinch guillotine hold R2 deny down. Jon Jones guys use this, especially cheesy ones, think Ortega has this as well. 

Feel free to correct me if I got anything wrong there lads."

UFC3,fmit0u7,t3_fvg76p,1586116319.0,"When I use Souza I'll try grab an ankle pick as early as possible if I'm fighting someone I know I have a significant grappling advantage over. The likes of Costa and Adesanya. If I miss the first one I try not to go back to it until my opponent whiffs a strike and I see an opening because obviously spamming the takedown makes you lose stam and your opponent will deny it easily if he is any good. If you get the ankle pick right away you go straight to side control. One denial against an Adesanya or Costa player and I go straight to the Kimura from side control. Usually you can get them outta there right away because of how OP Souza Submission offense is.

If I'm fighting a GSP or something I'll try and fight on the feet too. You've got great power and speed with Souza to exchange with anyone on the feet. The thing that brings his overall striking stat down to an 89 is his switch stance. I think it's only an 80. Obviously you still need to always be careful. And if I'm scrapping with Costa on the feet I won't engage him as much and try to make him miss as much as possible. That way he will lose stam and be easier to takedown and submit.

Anyways like I was saying Souza is well-equipped on the feet. You've got basic boxing combos that you can definitely make work. The jab, front kick to body combo is useful unless your fighting a sidestepping jesus. You have a front kick to the head. And you can throw a straight right body kick/ head kick and stuff.

Hope this helps mate."
UFC3,fmis0i5,t3_fvho2t,1586115735.0,"Haha I just read you mentioned Souza. I main Souza in the Middleweight division, he's great.

UFC3,fmirrt7,t1_fmiezvp,1586115596.0,The overhand abusing Bishops are worse because his overhand is the Haymaker variation of the move. That one comes out quicker and Bishop already has the speed of a Featherweight.

You'll run into Wanderleis and Bishops that will base their whole game off the overhand knee, double uppercut. But they'll run away and wait the whole fight for you to chase them around. When you miss he'll let go with the overhand knee barrage.

Imo these are the worst guys because they abuse shitty, ugly looking OP techniques and run away at the same time."
