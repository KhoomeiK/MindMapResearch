customyugioh,fr2z6e1,t1_fr2y8vj,1589846735.0,"Woah this is pretty OP.

I feel like the effects are all right, except the dark one. That’s busted. First: the attributes and Cyberse thing is great and it would probably help decks that have all Cyberse of the same attributes such as Marincess and Salamangreat. Second, for a regular Cyberse deck like code talkers it would be so easy to swarm the field with regular main deck monsters with different attributes. I’d say a good act of balance would be that the attributes of the monsters that count should be only from extra deck monsters, that case it would be harder to activate all 6 effects in one single turn. Third, the dark effect is basically a free draw. I’d say that making your opponent banish of those revealed monsters would be good. Also like for the rest of the turn you cannot summon the monsters you revealed. Other than that, it’s a really creative spell card! Props for that :)"
