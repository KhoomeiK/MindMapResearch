Instagramreality,fqd0tj5,t3_gi3r8f,1589275699.0,"This girl is notorious for editing her pics on Instagram, not just her face but her body drastically too! It’s nice to see that she hasn’t gone TOO over board with this one."
thatHappened,fq809qn,t3_gha4i2,1589155869.0,What the fuck is going on
thatHappened,fq7zsfn,t1_fq6dy35,1589155581.0,I’m an identical twin and we’re actually the other way around. First born and rounder head!
insaneparents,fmbu4vr,t1_fmbt64s,1585933250.0,Her parents I expect. Isis is a beautiful name.
IBSHelp,fhhkho1,t3_f2vpq5,1581606234.0,"I don’t think it would harm anyone to try. I’ve been gluten free for a while now and I think it has helped, not drastically, I’m not cured, but I no longer feel nausea after eating, minimal bloating and I don’t feel sluggish either."
Instagramreality,ffzhpmy,t3_ew2rzt,1580379700.0,THIS IS FAKE hahah! The photo on her instagram isn’t blurred like this. Nice try.

Instagramreality,ff3xsl0,t3_ereh04,1579551187.0,The bottom left was taken Nov 2018.. the bottom right taken a few months ago. She’s openly admitted to gaining 1.5 stone since leaving Love Island and not obsessively using the gym. Terrible comparison!
crappycontouring,fekgerc,t3_epfnnu,1579199502.0,What?
Instagramreality,feg5jp6,t3_eohzgv,1579077927.0,She was gorgeous!!
IBSHelp,fe7sk7z,t3_eo242i,1578918774.0,"Pretty immediately for me too. Im IBS-D and currently 2 weeks into gluten free and I’m finding it’s helping. If I have something with gluten now, I get immediate stomach aches and within an hour or so I’m on the toilet!"
Instagramreality,fdynjwu,t3_emzc6i,1578781736.0,This made me audibly laugh
Instagramreality,fdi3uk8,t3_ekqiqd,1578435256.0,"Honestly if you look back through her photos on Instagram, some of them don’t even have her own face they’re edited so much!"
Instagramreality,fdi25xh,t3_elg55c,1578434394.0,What’s wrong with her right hand..
Instagramreality,f8wezyy,t3_e1rs9y,1574889315.0,"Even the tagged photo is edited. On her Instagram stories she’s totally normal and very attractive, no idea why she feels the need to edit herself this way!"

“If I drink loads it will water everything down in my stomach and i’ll be fine!” 😂"
ibs,f14f3f7,t3_d4c24b,1569173715.0,"Have you tried any probiotics? (Sorry if you have. I did read your post I didn’t see any mention of any I am aware of!) I’m currently trying ‘Saccharomyces boulardii’ from OptiBac, they’re good bacteria that are all natural, Vegan, with no gluten and no dairy, and could really help with the diarrhoea without needing to use Imodium as often! 

I‘m also trying Magnesium, as it can be calming for your muscles and may help cramps? Either you can buy a spray which you can spray directly onto the area or tablets.

I’m sorry I’m not much help, I’m actually in the same position as you and in the process of trying different things and seeing what works for me!

(On another note, seeing that you did not continue on the Venlafaxine makes me incredibly pleased for you! What a terrible drug it is!!)"

Thanks :)"
depression,f0e1sre,t3_d4exjo,1568561973.0,I feel this way.. I suffered badly and never got into a ‘first time job’ because of my severe anxiety. Now I’m 22 with no work experience and looking for a first time job is difficult as employers expect you to have some sort of experience in their field due to your age..
IBSHelp,f0ccrtq,t3_d4c7fy,1568538714.0,"I can spend up to about half an hour in the bathroom, I’ve got into a routine where I usually go about an hour after I’ve got out of bed (and things start moving) and again a few hours later, which makes it impossible for me to spontaneously make plans early morning and I tend to not leave the house before midday due to fear I won’t be able to go to the bathroom if needs be.. it’s awful planning your life around your BMs."
wholesomememes,f05k3td,t3_d3ofie,1568411787.0,Ha! Every day is a celebration for the oldest kid in my family. She’s the only one my mother pays attention to.
depression,f04e0c1,t3_d39ghz,1568385490.0,Puberty was the point in which things took a turn for me. Overly emotional and no support trying to understand it. 10 years on and I’m still struggling daily and crying for no reason.

sex,eyu1uk0,t1_ew2u280,1567450882.0,"I agree with the most part of this. Except where you say “if you’re not willing to take care of him” and “that’s real love”.
I’m sorry but you’re wrong. Real love is respecting the person you’re with and guiding them through their issues and never forcing them to ‘get you off’ just because you think you’re entitled to it. 
Relationships are better with sex, of course! However relationships also grow so much stronger when your partner cares enough to put their own pleasure aside for a little while to help you through your own problems."
DoesAnybodyElse,eyp16t9,t3_cxygqm,1567287485.0,Yes! And everyone asks “why are you not outside enjoying the sunshine?” ...because I hate it!!
