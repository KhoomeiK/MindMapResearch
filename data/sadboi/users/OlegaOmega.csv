No problem, take care and be kind to yourself."

I’m sorry I don’t have anything better to say! This looks amazing, well done - I wish I lived with you!

How long has it taken you to perfect this?"
AskUK,fhyrsqo,t3_f5hpu9,1581982325.0,"I agree, we’re very lucky not to be subjected to extremes of weather (especially not frequently).

However, getting soaked in the rain walking to work is incredibly annoying! I can’t see how we will ever move society from cars to walking/cycling. This is one of many reasons though but a significant one to me!"
depression,fhyqtr6,t3_f5c12v,1581981717.0,"I always compare it to feeling like an apple that’s rotting from the inside but looks fine from the outside.

It’s amazing to me that we can feel so abjectly horrible and people can’t tell. It feels like it’s so awful everyone must be able to see.

There are lots of us though and hopefully we can find comfort in each other."
depression,fhyprt3,t1_fhyopp7,1581981040.0,"That’s interesting, I’ve always liked keeping up with current affairs and news but I find the negativity/lack of any hope can be rather soul destroying... I get drawn to sports now!

I do like reading about people with hope and planning for the future, though. Those who are resilient to pessimism and naysayers! I also don’t have much of an imagination so the ideas people have are fascinating to me. Any specific ideas/topics of interest to you?

Totally, there’s just no easy, quick relief. I don’t know if you’ve seen Bojack Horseman but I always try to keep this in mind. I don’t know why but it just resonates. https://youtu.be/R2_Mn-qRKjA"

depression,fhyo0uu,t1_fhymw0t,1581979942.0,"That’s amazing! How did you get into marathon running? The stamina and discipline required seems superhuman to me.

Totally, I’ve had months of depression fog and was so sick of just feeling “lifeless” and I knew exercise was the only thing that would help but it was the absolute last thing I wanted to do. I just got on my bike and starting riding, felt pretty good, not amazing. It’s hard to stick with it. The alternative is pretty much sitting and rotting away though. 

I definitely think it’s easier to look after yourself in the Summer. The weather is miserable where I am - short days and dark nights/mornings, constantly grey/drizzly - it doesn’t help my broken brain!

What do you enjoy reading about? No problem, thanks for your reply :)"
depression,fhymn82,t3_f5gavg,1581979096.0,"Hey, I just wanted to say I have no idea what the answer is but I feel the same, always have.

You’re amazing for sticking with it and putting up with this. 

Perhaps you could seek some medical advice if it’s impacting your life to such an extent? You don’t need/deserve to be so miserable."
depression,fhymds2,t3_f5ghc6,1581978932.0,"The craziest thing to me is that we spend more time with our coworkers than with our own family/friends!

I guess it makes our free time more special(?!). That’s what I try and tell myself. I try to remember this boring job was my dream once and it keeps me from boredom, poverty, homelessness and ill mental health.

Try and improve something everyday. One thing. Learn something or talk to a coworker or do something to improve your job/self. It doesn’t matter how small. Just make the next day better than the last.

Any hobbies/interests? Hopefully you can find some joy outside of work, although I always feel drained!

I do try to exercise though as it really does give you energy, it can be very very hard to find the motivation, though."
depression,fhylymp,t3_f5gln6,1581978671.0,"It’s ok to be selfish and it’s ok to feel like you have everything and not feel ok.

Getting mad at yourself if just going to hurt you and you don’t deserve that.

You should be really proud of yourself for putting up with so much shit, it’s not your fault.

Do you think you could talk to any of there friends? Or your family? Even if you’re not sure what to say, just open up the dialogue. You never know what people are hiding or feeling. Maybe they even know on some level how you feel.

I found help in friends, medication, meditation, CBT sessions, exercise and other things. It’s an absolute battle, there are good days and bad days. You can do this."
depression,fhyllwv,t3_f5gssd,1581978452.0,"Yep, I hear you.

I think it’s a mix of habit and the vacuum that is left by depression robbing you of all your hopes, dreams and energy, especially if it sets it at a young age.

I never really planned any life because I thought I’d be dead, quite honestly. Nothing really appeals to me.

I’m trying to “untrain” my brain from the hardwired negative thoughts, it’s difficult but as I see it I’m trying to undo years of negativity. I feel like my brain is broken

At least we’re still here trying! I’m proud of you."
depression,fhyh7vk,t3_f51oky,1581975837.0,"I don’t know if it’s any comfort to know there are lots of us who understand and feel the same.

Your mom is so lucky to have such a lovely, selfless child.

Hold on, it can get better."
Accutane,fhn0awv,t3_f3nszx,1581720303.0,"Wow, you're beautiful!

To those that don't know, it's just clear skin.

To those that do, it's confidence, happiness and freedom.

So glad it's been worth it for you - go show off that gorgeous face!!"
curlyhair,fhmxlt5,t3_f3vc08,1581719332.0,"If someone can't love you for more than your hair, that's a bit silly.

If someone can't love those curls, it's ridiculous."
depression,fhmwidf,t3_f3q9w7,1581718941.0,"What a wonderful person you are. To be in what I remember as the loneliest, most desolate mental state, beyond all feeling and reason, and to think of others.

Thank you for being so selfless and thoughtful. I know at least one person reading will find comfort in your words, probably many more.

Overthinking fuels anxiety but it also makes you a kind, empathetic person and I think we all know the world needs more of them.

This too shall pass, just weather the storm. Remember, you are good.

Thank you again!"
relationships,ev7n06o,t3_cimgll,1564261747.0,"I completely empathise  as I have similar issues myself and have also dealt with sharing space etc. with my partner. It’s a minefield and it can make you doubt yourself, as well. A lot of difficult adjustments and decisions have to be made.

I think as an introverted and private person, it’s great when someone a little more extroverted can pull us out of our shell a little and your partner has obviously helped you. However, it has to be done with understanding and with the aim to improve each other and your relationship. It’s one thing for them to balance you out and challenge you, but this shouldn’t mean being dictated to or belittled.

There should be a compromise on both sides and this doesn’t seem to be happening here. I understand it’s a little impossible in your situation as it’s pretty black and white; you either live together or you don’t! But if your partner cares for you that much and is that invested in your future, I don’t think you’d be feeling so pressurised and she would have the patience to wait and support you. 

Do you know why she’s so focused on moving in together? Playing devil’s advocate: perhaps if you’ve gotten used to being alone and you’re quite reserved - maybe she’s worried about the relationship or your intentions? Maybe try talking things through a little more as you both obviously want to be together, but if she’s unwilling to understand or compromise, don’t make yourself unhappy for someone else.

Honestly, I think you’ve trusted yourself to wait for someone who will love and respect you and it would be a shame to undo this and feel uncomfortable and pressured into doing something you don’t want."
