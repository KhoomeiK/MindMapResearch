My plan was to somehow give letters to people who know her well and within each letter include clues as to who I am and where I am with those letters. Each letter will also have information about someone I know personally so that she can contact that person and learn more about who I really am.

I was hoping to do this with five letters. Each one based around a different letter from my stage name: K-A-L-K-I. I am considering writing poems within each letter as well. She is based in Mumbai, India and I am based in New York City. I would love if the clues take her on some sort of worldwide adventure (she has money so it‚Äôs not really a problem for her).

It could possibly end in Iceland (using the letter I). This is a destination that both of us have been trying to visit and yet neither of us have been to yet. I‚Äôd love to hear your input and trust me, she knows a lot about me already so this isn‚Äôt totally out of the blue. I just want to seal the deal for a girl who loves puzzles!"

I could read notes, I could play a tune on the piano or guitar and I could hear and match pitches vocally but ask me to sing a solo and my voice quivered off key. Then I had a religious experience this past summer which fundamentally changed my life and now I feel like singing was within me all along, just waiting to be unlocked. 

Even rhythm, I trained as a percussionist in middle school but I was always a beat or two off. Now? I never miss a beat.

Any idea what happened? Did the connections in my brain suddenly make sense? Does music come from a deep understanding of a higher power? Was it within me all along and only until I realized the truth about God did he give me the ability to sing?"

My question is, how do I help her to see me for who I really am without making it seem like I‚Äôm some random fan? Also, is it worth trying to push forward and set up a first date when I arrive in India or should I be thinking more about how she should come to me/know my own worth?

It is only later as Hinduism evolved did various texts start to argue for cow worship.

For me personally, I eat beef because I enjoy the taste however I realize that it is not sustainable for us human beings to continue eating beef long term. I may stop eating it at some point in my life but I have not reached that stage yet.

My belief is that we are currently in Kalyug so it is natural for us to eat animals for food. However, I also believe we are nearing the end of Kalyug and Satyug will be ushered in around the time that lab grown meat becomes economically viable and the killing of animals is banned. I am hoping that happens within my lifetime.
