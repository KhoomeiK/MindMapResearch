OCD,fqzb2wb,t3_glmpum,1589763644.0,"hey, I have had ocd since I was 9.....it was normal to me, but some how it troubled everyone, like not wanting to go to school, having trouble socializing, being the outcast of outcasts, the center of bullying and ridicule....  now at age 50, i got a nasty mental illness I went schizoaffective with that ocd (two different disorders) and Im being kicked out of my third appartment, and heaven help me find a place during this covid thing. to me Its causing people to undstand obessional fear (corona virus) and hand washing....it looks like we get our justice as people realize what a guy like how mandel goes through.  Now we kinda fit in in a wierd way.  if your brain aint in a cast with stitches or something, people just dont understand things like neglected cleaning, and hygiene..... even I know I neglect it all like we all know we want to top being scared all the time, and yet I cant really do a thing on my own initiative... peace peope, I turned man of God...cause God accepts me...right now Im a hermit..but you know what....I gained alot of psycholgical skill for taking an interest in my health self teaching way, in good faith...so that God would approve...cause like who is man to approve of anything, when God does.  If anyone says Im no pastor, let him/her take it to God...cause im not arguing the point.  Im like some kinda ocd coach, now....but psychology is my interest...i love psychology and how the brain works, the chemcials etc....but I will always be a Reverend Dr, Divinity\]"

OCD,fqbdq9a,t3_ghr62k,1589235101.0,"one thing tho...you are not a bad person,,,,,on the contrary...ocd makes people very moral and conciencious in whatever they do and intelligence we get as a gift."
OCD,fqbddyf,t3_ghr62k,1589234923.0,"do not mix ocd with religion...thats a huge rule NO NO.....like a religious schizo that goes too far...youre not demon possessed and those rituals of religiousness mean nothing cause the dreaded blasphemes come back..... look relgion isnt going to do anything but be a support to you, I know cause Im too myself as a hermit, cause people make me anxious....so i use my faith to cope....but if you get a blasphmemous thought, idea, or imagine, remember its all content...in context....= intruding anxiety due to shortage of sertononin.....which cause relfexive rituals to ease discomfort....my answer is the hell with it, and just follow the lead of Jesus.... I am the ocd mystic.... I am a pastoral knight hermit....d.div"
OCD,fqbci08,t3_ghr62k,1589234472.0,"look its a matter of context and content....ocd will still be the same in context no matter what, the content changes....do not get caught up with the content...its useless..... the contect is compulsive urges to do anxious obsessive rituals.....to feel better from the impending doom...I wonder if yall had that experience, of impending doom....thats what heart attack victims go through, and we are actually used to that feeling... go figure...."
mentalillness,fq3y6b3,t3_gfk1kc,1589071640.0,"really I think it ridiculous, because for being a pastor the isrealites wanted to go back to egypt thinking we were much better off as slaves...than dying of hunger....griping at moses.....The response for that was....YOU CAN NEVER TURN BACK because you forget just how bad slavery was to the egyptians, that your hunger is actually nothing to GOD....and then quail and mana was provided."
OCD,fq3w2nh,t3_gfojtv,1589070966.0,"my ocd was not handwashing or contamination obessessions mine were flicking the light switch on and off 4 x4  bedtime routine role...rinsing glasses 4x before drinking....4 being the closest thing to perfectly right an just so..... you would never catch me at my rituals, unless you counted my repetitive behavior.... 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 break"
OCD,fpq6u0q,t3_genlkx,1588816339.0,"I had ocd since I was 9 and Im 50.  I developed a double whammy when I went schizoaffective because I couldnt handle confronting my ocd at the time. a lesson, what ever you do, if you have a fear of drugs, dont take them to beat your obsessive fear.  I was 18.  Now I tried to get diagnosed OCD'ed so I could get medicated, turns out I had to treat it myself the hard way with existing psychologies.  what kept me going was to help others with it.  You can expect perhaps being exposed to triggers but told to refuse to respond and relearn that you will not die say if you did not wash your hands like normal...or you can expect cognitive behavioral therapy...this is psychological treatment and I find it works well....but paxil is the drug that designed for OCD.  theres luvox, prozac, wellbutrin, effexor, zoloft.....take your pick at whatever works besst for you....remember the psychiatrist is probably going to be arrogant...they very rarely ever arent...you can expect your dr to have way fancy name...like farquhar or vaccaflor  you know what I mean..hahhahahh as wierd as the names they give for their drugs...like cmon.. well butrin...effex or....hahahah and you can expect the stress that goes along with the psych change....the meds are the training wheels, psychology is the bike....  take the clonazpepam if they give it to you, BUT AS PRESCRIBED....miss doses than increase them because its addictive....maybe even ativan......and take an interest in your mental health.  show you are willing to work as a team with the dr.  the dr is not a god.  there is no magic pill.....but there are pills that reduce symptoms... if your ocd is bad expect say your paxil to go as high as 40mgs and not more."
OCD,fpq3zth,t3_geng60,1588814707.0,"well having ocd myself but treated it in faith, like AA and psychology, this is my expertise.  Ive never thought of doing handstands tho.  Look, ocd or obsessive compulsive disorder is misleading a name.  its compulsive obsessive disorder.  your compulsive urges to obsessively do rituals.  Thats where the power is.  Just use the urges to stop doing the obsessive rituals."
