relationship_advice,fodr1k3,t3_g6qvue,1587688509.0,"I have to put myself back into the mind of my 16 year old self and I know you won’t want to tell her parents. So let’s look at these options: 1. Try talking to her one more time. Tell her you love her but you think he’s trying to take advantage of her. 
If that fails then 2. if you have a bf you bring him along & let your parents know where you’ll be. 
2. If there’s no bf then you can bring 3 more friends. He has friends there she can too. Still tell your parents where you’ll be. 

Also... Corona Virus?! What is this camping in a group thing anyway? We should all be protecting ourselves."
AskReddit,fm5bgg6,t3_ft6ulw,1585769831.0,Agreed!
AskReddit,fm5be4y,t3_ft6upg,1585769797.0,End world hunger somehow & fix issues of homelessness and poverty.. then I’d fix my life of course lol.
relationship_advice,flpceob,t1_flpbk4u,1585356250.0,"I think since you do trust both of them you can set some HEALTHY boundaries for your relationship. Not to be controlling at all but if you’re uncomfortable with them hanging out that late, it’s justified and you should let him know that you would prefer if he didn’t do it. Try to figure out why he feels obligated to be by her side until 11:30 PM too. 

A little jealousy is normal so express yourself and after you have come to an agreement all you have to do is wait and see. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with him helping a friend but neglecting you to do that is never gonna work. If after this agreement is made he still doesn’t respect your feelings or wants then maybe it’s time to suspect there’s something else going on. 

I also think the 3 of you should try to hang out more in the future."
relationship_advice,flpbkec,t3_fq8na3,1585355712.0,"Guess what? you’ll get another love that makes you feel that way plus more. If you’re not ready for dating yet focus on other things that make you happy. We’re all stuck inside so do video calls with your friends, read books, do your make up and take bomb pictures and post them to your social media. 
It’s been a year but you’re not over it yet and there’s no rush for you to be but in the meantime, take care of yourself. You’ll soon realize that maybe you wouldn’t have worked out. Plus if it’s meant to be, he’ll come back sooner or later"
relationship_advice,flpavgz,t3_fq8nai,1585355282.0,How old are you? Also have you expressed to him that you feel neglected? Is this coming out of nowhere or is there some gut feeling or something why you feel this way?
AskReddit,flpaa41,t1_flpa35u,1585354916.0,His response seems reasonable
AskReddit,flpa7y3,t3_fq8od2,1585354879.0,I either ignore him or stare for 2 seconds then smile lol I don’t know how to do anything else so I’m sticking to that approach!
AskReddit,flp9sx2,t3_fq8pc3,1585354625.0,Deep breaths/a nice long shower/ my fav songs or just being alone sometimes does the trick. If you have a pet sometimes they can help too
AskReddit,flp9n71,t1_flp6lfh,1585354528.0,What kind of snacks were they? Lol very dramatic response.
relationship_advice,flp9iu5,t1_flp90z9,1585354454.0,"Happy to respond! If little projects don’t help I don’t think there’s much else you can do outside of letting him know that you need two hours to do your work or whatever else. Tell him when you’re done you’ll hang out but he just has to understand. You shouldn’t feel guilty at all, It’s very nice of you to spend as much time with him as you do but your work is important. I hope everything works out"
relationship_advice,flp86f8,t3_fq8rpq,1585353659.0,"He’s old enough to understand that you need time but due to circumstances I wouldn’t tell you to turn him away completely. I can imagine he’s a little lonely so maybe you can give him some “assignments” to occupy his time while you work. So for example if he’s a kid who likes to read, tell him to read a book and write sort of a report and when you’re done with your work you’ll “grade” it. Have you tried things like that?"
AskReddit,flp7jd1,t3_fq8sal,1585353281.0,Travel. I’d want to see the world and document that
AskReddit,flp7h1d,t3_fq8sd0,1585353243.0,End of days type of thing. It was the rapture and the devil and all his demons were roaming the earth. I refused to join his team in a sense and he resorted to killing every single person I’ve ever known in front of me. So in the dream day after day he killed someone else trying to break me. It was terrifying. I woke up with a scream so loud my mother ran into the room and i was crying. This was a couple years ago and I try not to think about it.
AmItheAsshole,flp4mt8,t3_fq73sk,1585351574.0,"I hope this is a troll. YTA, why would you exclude him like that? It’s not nice that he called you those things but do you know how hurtful it is when your parent makes it obvious that they prefer your sibling for whatever reason. Shame on you!"
offmychest,flp4col,t3_fq74gg,1585351408.0,"I’m not a mom but honestly I think this is normal. I remember when I was their age, being stuck in the house with my parents wasn’t a dream come through either so maybe they’ll welcome that break too. Two hours isn’t bad but you should bring your phone, tell them to give you a list and you’ll see what you can get and tell them to only call in case of an emergency."
AskReddit,flp2ksj,t3_fq75zm,1585350385.0,How are you doing with all the changes recently?
AskReddit,flp1py8,t1_floxy3h,1585349898.0,I like your Papa lol
AskReddit,flp0kl5,t3_fq78uz,1585349256.0,"When I was in high school I woke up and saw silver orbs floating in a corner of my room. Having learned that they’re related to spirits about a month before I closed my eyes quickly and forced myself to sleep. A few days later I woke up at 1 am and I was just chillin until I felt like going back to bed. Out of nowhere I started feeling tense and sorta like something bad was gonna happen so I decided I should go back to bed. I turned on my side and immediately I felt a presence in my room. Like someone just standing there watching me. I kept my eyes shut as tight as possible and the presence felt like it was standing directly above me just looking. I felt the hair on the back of my neck standing up and every instinct telling me to run but I stayed still. After about 5 minutes it moved to the end of the bed where my feet were and I felt the spot beside my feet sink as if someone sat there. My heart was beating so fast and I didn’t know what to do. When I tell you I almost peed my pants in that moment. Anyway, I couldn’t force myself to sleep or force myself to get brave and run so I just stayed as still as I could with my eyes closed then after a while I didn’t feel the weight on the bed anymore so I unlocked my phone and used the light to peep. There was nothing there. This might not be the scariest story ever but I will never forget how helpless & scared I felt that night."
AskReddit,floyumv,t1_floy862,1585348264.0,Lol wow. 😂
AskReddit,floy7hu,t3_fq7a3w,1585347895.0,Getting my hair done. Lol sounds silly but I just feel so great.
Anxiety,flog19g,t3_fpzhti,1585337598.0,They do and sometimes make me doubt myself .. it’s hard to explain to people who don’t understand.
Dreams,flhuyaq,t1_flhtn3v,1585169971.0,Wow. Thank you. I’ll look more into this
Anxiety,flgrfid,t3_fo6h6w,1585148847.0,Yeah.. I’ve been very very stressed out so my chest gets tight and it’s hard to breathe. My brain knows that it’s anxiety since this is nothing new however I panic anyway thinking it’s this virus. Idk what to do anymore.
relationship_advice,flgpkwp,t3_fopse9,1585147785.0,I’m so sorry this happened to him. Being violated in such a way is absolutely terrifying. As a victim I’d say just be gentle and as understanding as you can be. Also defending him to the ignorant who assume this can’t happen to men will be a big help. You may also suggest professional help for him to handle this in a healthy way. I hope those two face the harshest of consequences.
AmItheButtface,flgohyv,t3_foloy3,1585147150.0,I’ll call you the buttface simply because you allowed this guy to continuously use you. I’m glad you put an end to it. He’s an adult and I don’t get why he would find it fair to manipulate you into something like this.
AmItheAsshole,fjmd696,t3_fe04fo,1583467412.0,Nta. People honor deceased loved ones in this way all the time. This one just happens to be a weird coincidence. Your child will get teased so that is a concern but I don’t think you’re an asshole. It’s sweet how supportive your husband is and I’m glad you both came to the decision to change his last name. Also.. Screw your “friend” for sharing that into a Facebook group and screw all the people for accusing you of child abuse. I hope you continue to enjoy motherhood as time goes by! Congratulations on your little bundle of joy.
AskReddit,fjj0tqk,t3_fdhien,1583380364.0,The sound of the rain soothes me. Kind of like muting a tv? It mutes the environment and all I can hear is the raindrops. The temperature gets cooler and my home feels comfy. Watching the raindrops even makes me feel at ease. I love the rain.
relationship_advice,fji2cpz,t3_fdgchh,1583359433.0,"“In a joking manner” is not good enough. He’s a grown man and so is his friend. “Have her start calling you master” is clear as day. As a black woman I’m absolutely disappointed at him “poking fun” at her race. I really hope he hasn’t been feeding her any negative bullshit just because he’s ignorant. He’s used the term before, there’s no question about that. Please confront him and be stern. That is completely unacceptable. Please protect that baby from this mess. She’s already going to have to deal with so much."
relationship_advice,fj7z6iq,t3_fbzfnl,1583101524.0,I’m having a pretty crappy day and dick linen made me laugh for the first time so thank you. If the way he says things are harmless maybe it’s nothing to worry about
askatherapist,fj6963c,t3_f9dy8q,1583062958.0,"I don’t understand this either. I know therapists are forced to use whatever info you give them in order to help you work through your issues so the building thing might be an underlying problem for him. However, therapists also teach you how to generally deal with your emotions so his actions don’t seem like someone who is ready to work. Would he lie about therapy? Maybe you will get closure one day but I doubt it will be now. I hope you’re okay."
relationship_advice,fj4jh6t,t1_fj49xya,1583009699.0,Thank you
