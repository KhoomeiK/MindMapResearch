I don't have any studies on me right now, but telling someone about their issues is a very good sign that they might not end up doing it, even if they might get very low.

Also it might not be an issue of you having ""pushed her over the edge"" rather than her simply not wanting to discuss the situation with you, as a stranger, if she did initially just make a mistake with sending the message to a wrong person. It doesnt mean that she has necessarily harmed herself (other than getting drunk). She might have just been uncomfortable wit the situation, which is still not ideal but I think you did a very good thing trying to help her.

At the end of the day, someone else's life is NOT your responsibility. This stranger's life and choices are not something you should carry on your shoulders, and it is very important that no matter what might have happened it is not your fault. None of it."

Basically what it initially did for me was that it pulled me out of intense suicidality. It kinda evened out my mood swings for a bit and I felt more stable. Still felt like shit a lot and was struggling with a ton of issues but I never felt like I had at my worst.

People won't die just from the virus. Everyone insisting on never opening the society back up, even at the risk of a second wave, seem incredibly short-sighted and inconsiderate of others to me. It's selfish fear masked with high morals. Sure, it's fine to be concerned of catching it themselves, or a vulnerable family member catching it, but - I don't know.

People will die. From poverty, suicide, domestic violence, other illnesses (people with cancer already might not get treatment because it would lower their immune system, people with heart issues are avoiding urgent care).

At one point she asked if she could cook all my meals for me so I wouldn't need to go to the kitchen at all!

Also alright I looked it up - it's a valid scientific term, I'll give you that. Seems like the concept has been helpful in explaining how contemporary familial structures were originally born.

However, tell me - how relevant do you think all of this is in the modern age, when our civilisations are well established and the survival of the human race is not at an immediate risk? Also have you examined how you feel about women who are, according to you, 'not able to pair-bond' vs. men who are not able to do so? Does your opinion differ?

Also how are you able to determine if a woman you do not know has the ability to pair-bond or not? Are you her therapist? Her doctor? Or just a guy on the internet who heard about a stranger's sexual history in passing and made an immediate misogynist judgement?"

virgin,f9iztqp,t1_f9h7225,1575350787.0,"Oh yeah no some of my self-esteem issues definitely stemmed from not feeling wanted. I think that having sex mainly just changed how I view my struggles, because I now think that I was mainly just craving intimacy and human connection on a far deeper level than friendship.

I heavily believe that if I had had my first time with a stranger who I didn't necessarily trust as much as I trusted the person I did end up doing it with, I would have felt very emotionally unfulfilled. It was most definitely a self-esteem boost, but not in the way I expected or necessarily wanted it to be. I don't think that sex is a magical fix-it-all - and I definitely used to wish that it would be."

I still feel lonely in many ways, and having sex hasn't fixed that because my loneliness is rooted in something far deeper than that, i.e. my mental health issues, which cannot be fixed by having sex.

> But not many people think the same way

IMHO those people are dicks! If somebody places that much value on your level of sexual expertise they don't care about you and it's important for you to value yourself enough to not associate with people who think so lowly of you because of something like that.

>For us men it's really difficult since most women expect men to know what they are doing, to be experienced and confident.

Yeah I can see why that would feel intimidating. I honestly had no clue what I was doing most of the time but the person I was with was very understanding and some of it did come naturally to me. Honestly if you're with the right person it won't matter how experienced or confident you are! It's not wrong to ask questions and ask if the things you're doing are alright - I actually think it's better if you do do that.

I'm sorry you feel like this. I'm sorry that _I_ felt the way you do. I felt so old to be having sex for the first time at 24. But I'm glad it happened the way it did, even if I had to wait for so long."

I ask if it's takeaway last because that's what makes sense with the order of things I have to do on the till, so if somebody starts their order saying it's takeaway, chances that I'll ask again when it actually comes time for me to press 'bag' or 'no bag' on the till - let's just say it's very high."
AskReddit,f7ncobt,t1_f7moodz,1573895768.0,"I've been going through a really hard time period in my life lately and I've recently started giving out more than ever to the homeless people I see around. It's not much - tea and apple pie handed to the lady sitting outside and that I get from work for free on my break anyway, or passing on a £1 somebody gave me for a spare cig.

It's just that I don't necessarily need these things, they're not life-changing to me, but for a homeless person it could mean something. And in turn it makes me feel better because it reminds me that I'm still capable of empathy and that I'm not as horrible of a person as I think I am because I still get joy from helping others. I wish I had time to properly volunteer but it's not an option right now."

I'm not their closest friend in the group and tbf I'm not sure if they'd want to rejoin the group because I've heard that it made them feel left out as they never felt like they could join the conversation... So I'm not really sure what to do. Also they left the group yeeeaaars ago and have drama with some other members of the chat so it's, uh, complicated."
coolguides,f6nny3i,t1_f6niwic,1572995789.0,"I have this friend who used to often say no when invited, or be very quiet and detached whenever present. They would also often leave very early. They're now very lonely, and often mention how they wish they'd get invited to the things our friend group does - the thing is, they left the group chat we have years ago, and haven't asked to rejoin since. They are and always have been very welcome, and it's been very hard to see them feeling lonely when it'd be so easily fixed if they reached out to us.

So I never understood this, until I started doing the same. I find it difficult to reach out to people, and get sad when nobody reaches out to me. But nobody's gonna come fetch me from my house, especially when I've said no so many times before. Mental illness is a bitch."
