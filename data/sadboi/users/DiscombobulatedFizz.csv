- Until college, math was always my favorite and strongest subject. I enjoyed doing math homework and liked that there was a clear answer. Reading was difficult for me because it’s more subjective. I don’t think I would be good at calculus though. The highest math course I took was statistics, and enjoyed that. I’m not as good with trigonometry. 
- I don’t understand the second question!
- I do appreciate technology and have a moderate understanding of how it works, but by no means am I a technology wizard. 
- I am both logical and emotional. I think I suppressed/denied my emotions for a long time and considered myself an unemotional person. Now I see that I am more emotional than I thought, and am almost childlike in my emotional regulation when I’m stressed. I wear my emotions on my sleeve to an extent but am emotionally mature. I also feel like I am very aware of other people’s emotions. 
- I dress pretty casually, for comfort and function. If I’m not in leggings and a jean jacket, I wear jeans and a casual shirt with booties. Minimal jewelry and makeup. 
- I consider people to be their own best experts, so even if I feel like what’s best for them is somewhat apparent, I mainly ask questions to help them arrive at their own conclusion. I hate being told what to do, and to try to avoid telling people what they need to do. 


Sorry I’m so bad at answering questions lol"

I’m dealing with it right now and it’s hard not to flare it up with things I consume (coffee, acidic things, so many triggers actually). From what I have understood, risk of NSAID induced gastritis can be reduced by taking them after eating and using the smallest dose necessary for symptom relief. My GI doctor said I can’t take them at all anymore and I’m so sad about it because it helped with the pelvic pain and my autoimmune symptoms.
